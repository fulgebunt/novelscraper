However, each could only be changed once, and they could be refreshed every day at seven in the morning.Han Jue had been refreshing since he was born.It had been eleven years, but he still hadn't managed to produce the best attributes and Connate Providence.\"Should I just start like this?\"A thought popped up in Han Jue's mind.No!It wasn't easy for him to come to a world of immortals and ghosts. How could it allow mortals to cultivate?Han Jue wanted to be the almighty protagonist!Roll the dice again!Han Jue raised his hand and clicked at the attributes list in front of him.Cultivation Potential changed![Cultivation Potential: None]Han Jue's young face instantly darkened.Again![Destined Lone Star: Brings bad luck to friends and family.

In his previous life, he lived in the 21st century on Earth. At a young age, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He didn't want to undergo painful treatment and went home to wait for death. That night, to numb himself, he found an old-school cultivation game to play.He played all night and was very hyped up. He got sleepy at dawn and thus died.When he opened his eyes again, he was reincarnated into this ancient world. He was born into a cultivation sect.The Jade Pure Sect was a righteous cultivation sect of the Great Yan Dynasty.On the day that he was diagnosed with terminal cancer, Han Jue was terrified. This was the first time he knew that life was so important.But now in his new life, he could actually cultivate!He was pleasantly surprised!He had to cultivate!He wanted to live longer than anyone else!However, he couldn't cultivate as a mortal!Ever since he was born, Han Jue had been living without any pressure. His parents were the servants of Elder Iron, an Alchemy Master of the Jade Pure Sect's outer sect. They usually planted medicinal herbs for Elder Iron.An alchemist's status was special. In the outer sect, no one dared to offend Elder Iron. He had dozens of servants under him, all of whom were mortals.Even if they had cultivation potential, Elder Iron wouldn't allow his servants to cultivate. He was probably afraid they would steal his herbs.His herbs were beneficial to cultivators, but to mortals, they were poison.However, when he was six years old, his parents fled, leaving the young Han Jue in Elder Iron's herb garden.Han Jue could understand. It would definitely be inconvenient to escape with a child.Elder Iron didn't mind. Instead, he asked someone to guide Han Jue in helping him grow the herbs.As time passed, Han Jue became familiar with all the plants in the herb garden.Elder Iron didn't make things difficult for Han Jue, and Han Jue continued to roll his dice.Since he was a mortal now, he might as well wait.This content is taken from lightnovelworld.com\"Sigh, I will just keep rolling. If I can't produce a heaven-defying Providence before the age of thirty, then forget it. Even if I'm gonna cultivate as a mortal, so be it.\"Han Jue thought silently.The oldest servant in the herbal garden was in his seventies. He was called Old Man Wang. He had been chosen by Elder Iron when he was in his teens. Now, he was the leader of the servants. All the servants followed his lead.Han Jue stood up and returned to the herb garden. He began to sprinkle water and clean up the dead leaves.The herb garden was huge, as big as a football field. Every servant was very careful when they worked. If they accidentally damaged the plants, Elder Iron would be furious. Some of the herbs were even poisonous.Elder Iron had only gone out last month and would probably take two to three years to return.To cultivators, two or three years were nothing at all.In the herb garden, Han Jue was a man of few words. He didn't have many friends and only interacted with Old Man Wang.After he was done, he returned to his room and started doing push-ups to train his body.\u2026The next morning, Han Jue washed up.Then, he sat on the wooden bed and waited.Han Jue waited until the time when the attributes list was refreshed before he perked up.It felt like a lottery draw.This was what he looked forward to the most every day.He rubbed his hands together.First, he was going to roll the dice for Cultivation Potential.[Cultivation Potential: None]F*ck!This is too despicable!Han Jue almost died of anger.His hands began to tremble as he continued to draw out the Connate Providence!The die rolled![Connate Providence is as follows][Unparalleled: Immortal beauty, top-notch charm][Destined Sword Fanatic: Top-notch Sword Dao aptitude, top-notch Sword Dao learning ability][Unparalleled Movement Technique: Top-notch movement technique aptitude][Descendant of the Immortal Emperor: After the game begins, you will receive an unparalleled cultivation technique and 1,000 superior-grade spirit stones.]Han Jue was stunned.His eyes widened in surprise.For more, visit lightnovelworld.comFour Connate Providences!This was the first time four Connate Providences had been produced, and they all looked very impressive.Han Jue became more and more excited.This is it!No!They are it!Four top-notch, one unparalleled!One look and one could tell that it was extraordinary.After rolling the dice for eleven years, day after day, the goddess of fortune was finally blessing him!Han Jue tried hard to calm down.Without a Cultivation Potential, he couldn't start his game life yet.He still had to roll the dice for the Cultivation Potential.\"Finally, I'm seeing a silver lining. With these four supreme-grade Connate Providences, even if I start cultivating at the age of 40, I can still make it in time. I can rest assured and continue rolling the dice for Cultivation Potential.\"Han Jue was in a good mood when he thought of this.He had been rolling for eleven years, so what if it would take another eleven years?Han Jue let out a long sigh, then got up and left the room to begin his day's work.Six people were living in the house with him, and each of them had a bed. The others had woken up early in the morning.Everyone had a region they were responsible for, so they didn't dare to make any mistakes.Han Jue was still young and only needed to do some simple work. Elder Iron didn't dare to let him be in charge of an area.The sun was exceptionally bright today.Perhaps it had something to do with his mood.The other servants didn't feel Han Jue's change. He hadn't started his thrilling life yet, so the enhancements due to the Connate Providence hadn't appeared yet.Noon.Two cultivators arrived.The Jade Pure Sect was very big. The herb garden was surrounded by mountains. Cultivators weren't allowed to come here. Most of the time, the outer sect deacons would be the ones who came to ask for pills. These two cultivators had excellent temperaments. One was a man and the other was a woman. They looked like an immortal couple, attracting the attention of all the servants.Han Jue also turned to look at the entrance of the herb garden.\"How glamorous.\"Han Jue sighed.The clothes of the servants were tattered, and the clothes of the two cultivators were clean and gorgeous. They looked like NPCs from an online cultivation game.It was just a random exclamation. He didn't feel envious at all.This content is taken from lightnovelworld.comHe had already obtained four Connate Providences, and his future achievements were not something that the outer sect disciples of the Jade Pure Sect could compare to.The male cultivator expressionlessly said to Old Man Wang, \"From today onwards, the two of us will be responsible for protecting Elder Iron's medicinal herb garden. You don't need to be bothered by us. Also, don't disturb our cultivation.\"Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The outer sect has specially sent the two of us to protect you. You don't have to worry.\"Old Man Wang heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing that.He cupped his hands and bowed, then turned and left.The two cultivators walked away and meditated under the trees on both sides of the entrance into the herb garden.As they began their breathing exercises, visible whirlwinds appeared around them.That must be Spirit Qi.Han Jue thought silently and continued sprinkling water.\u2026The next day.Han Jue continued rolling the dice.[Cultivation Potential: None]Han Jue rolled his eyes.He actually didn't find it strange.He did not panic. In any case, he had obtained four top-notch Connate Providences, he could take his time in getting the best Cultivation Potential.The presence of the two cultivators did not change the lives of the herb garden servants.The dull life continued.Apart from his work, Han Jue trained his body and rolled the dice every day.The third day.He rolled the dice![Cultivation Potential: None]Fine!I know you're messing with me!Han Jue cursed in his head.On the fourth day.[Cultivation Potential: Five Elements Mixed Potential. Cultivation cannot exceed Foundational Establishment.]Yes, the standard for mortal cultivation.Han Jue shook his head.He still had to continue rolling the dice. He would never allow himself to cultivate as a mortal.Just like that, Han Jue exercised every day and rolled the dice every day.Most of the time, he would obtain Mixed Potential.He wasn't discouraged. He believed that he would be able to obtain a godlike Cultivation Potential.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comIt was fine to cultivate later.Anyway, he wasn't seeking revenge.\u2026Two years later.Elder Iron returned and the two cultivators bowed and bid farewell.All the servants gathered and knelt down before Elder Iron.Elder Iron wore a black robe, and two gourds were hanging from his waist. His hair was black and white, and his expression was gloomy and fierce. He looked very bad-tempered indeed.\"Not bad, no mistakes.\"Elder Iron looked around and smiled in satisfaction.The servants heaved a sigh of relief and smiled.Elder Iron looked at Han Jue and the other youngsters beside him.\"The four of you, follow me.\"Elder Iron pointed and walked towards his pavilion.Han Jue was one of the four.They immediately followed.\"He wants to arrange for us to be in charge of a portion of the garden?\" Han Jue thought silently.He suddenly noticed that blood was dripping from Elder Iron's right hand.Han Jue was shocked.Could it be that Elder Iron was injured and wanted to make them into puppets or use them as ingredients for pills?Han Jue had read many cultivation novels in his previous life. The one thing that left the deepest impression on him was that cultivators would rather kill their friends than die themselves.To cultivators, nothing was more important than their own lives.The more Han Jue thought about it, the more panicked he became. He didn't dare to escape and could only try his best to calm himself down.After entering the house, a youngster closed the door.Elder Iron sat at the end of the table and scrutinized Han Jue and the others.\"All of you, stretch out your hands.\" Elder Iron instructed.Han Jue and the others raised their right hands.Elder Iron touched them one by one.Han Jue could feel the goosebumps on his arm.\"Only you have a cultivation potential. The rest can go back,\" Elder Iron said to a tall and strong youth.Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.This morning, he rolled the dice for the Cultivation Potential again. Yesterday, he still had a Quadruple Cultivation Potential, but today, it was gone.Unexpectedly, it was a blessing in disguise.Han Jue looked at the youngster sympathetically.Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comZhang Ge, a passionate and popular teenager who liked pigeons.The other two youngsters looked at Zhang Ge with envy.Zhang Ge was both excited and nervous.Elder Iron didn't allow servants to cultivate, but this was also the first time he checked the servants' cultivation potential.After leaving the pavilion, Han Jue ignored the discussion of the other two youngsters and returned to work.From then on, Zhang Ge no longer participated in the labor.It turned out that Elder Iron had taken him in as a disciple. This made the other servants even more envious and jealous.Han Jue wasn't envious at all.It must be a trap!He would first nurture him before killing him!Han Jue was glad that he wasn't chosen.He had the system, so he didn't need a master.\u2026In the blink of an eye, another two years had passed.Elder Iron left the herb garden again half a year ago. After he had left, the two cultivators from before came to protect the herb garden again.Zhang Ge was already a cultivator. So, he even went forth to talk with the two cultivators.All the slaves had to obey him now.Fortunately, Zhang Ge was busy cultivating and did not bully other servants.They were slaves for the rest of their lives. Elder Iron often went out, and they weren't allowed to leave the herb garden. There were no conflicts of interest, so there were very few quarrels.Han Jue was already 15 years old and still kept a low profile.In the past four years, the best Cultivation Potential he rolled was a Triple Cultivation Potential. He could reach the Golden Core Realm with it.The Golden Core realm was nothing!Han Jue's goal was to live forever and become immortal.That morning.Han Jue rolled the dice casually. He didn't have any expectations. It was like getting up every day to rinse his mouth.[Cultivation Potential: Water and Wood double cultivation potential. Extraordinary aptitude.

The cultivators outside the barrier will not be able to sense the changes within the barrier.]Han Jue was pleasantly surprised. He immediately walked to the door. After confirming that all the servants had gone to the herb garden, he closed the door.He stood in the middle of the room and pulled up the stats list.

He couldn't be lazy anymore or he would be discovered.He immediately ran towards the herb garden.\"Han Jue, did you sleep in?\"A middle-aged servant chided him laughingly. Han Jue scratched his head in embarrassment, causing the others to laugh.They didn't think too much about it, nor did they really scold him. Han Jue rarely failed his duty.

It's so complicated\u2026\"Han Jue thought to himself. He was only at the first level of the technique and he could reach the ninth level of Qi Refining Realm.The Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique focused on a balanced development so that he could nurture the cultivation potentials of all six elemental types. Although the cultivation process was more complicated than cultivating only a single elemental type, Han Jue's aptitude was exceptional and could make up for it.Only when six types of Spirit Qi reached a certain level could one build their foundation!Han Jue was very excited and quietly sat up. He had the system set up a barrier around his bed so that the three cultivators outside wouldn't notice.The other five servants were sound asleep. After all, it had been a tiring day.Han Jue started to perform expiration exercises according to the first level.Expiration was a breathing technique.During the expiration process, he patiently sensed the Heaven and Earth Spirit Qi.In less than ten seconds, Han Jue felt the wind, earth, wood, and water Spirit Qi in the air.As for the fire and thunder Spirit Qi, he couldn't capture them yet.Han Jue began to absorb the four types of Spirit Qi.Words suddenly appeared before his eyes.Even though his eyes were closed, he could still see these words. It was truly miraculous.[This is your first time cultivating. These are the following options for your cultivation development.][Firstly, you can be a high-profile unparalleled prodigy.

Han Jue didn't want to fall in love with her.Once he loved someone, he would have a weakness.He wanted to live forever and not die halfway.He would consider romantic relationships once he had obtained immortality.As long as he was invincible, he could have as many women as he wanted. He wasn't afraid of his enemies finding trouble with him!As Han Jue worked, he made the firm decision to see Xing Hongxuan as a lure that would sway him from his goals.At this moment\u2026Xing Hongxuan suddenly rose to her feet.She walked over leisurely, attracting the attention of the other servants.She went straight to Han Jue and smiled. \"Come with me.\"Han Jue was stunned.The other servants looked at him enviously.To be able to attract the attention of such a fairy-like figure must be a good thing.All of them had already given up hope and had made themselves content with staying single for life.Han Jue didn't dare to refuse and could only nod.The two of them walked out of the herb garden.The male cultivator opened his eyes and asked, \"Hongxuan, what are you doing?\"He sized up Han Jue and frowned.He's so handsome!The herb garden servants had never left the garden their entire lives. They had no aesthetic taste, and with their habitual thinking, they didn't really notice the change in Han Jue much.As a female, Xing Hongxuan was the first to notice something different about him.The male cultivator observed Han Jue carefully only because of Xing Hongxuan.Han Jue's good looks made him instinctively unhappy.Xing Hongxuan covered her mouth and smiled. \"It's fine.

I'm not trying to bother you. I just want to ask you, are you really willing to be a slave in this herbal garden forever?\"Han Jue was silent.Next, you want me to bow before you and become your toy?Xing Hongxuan took a step forward and whispered into his ear, \"Help me do something. I will help you cultivate and rid you of your mortal identity.\"\"What is it?\"Xing Hongxuan opened and closed her mouth, but no sound came out. However, Han Jue heard her clearly.\"Help me obtain Elder Iron's alchemy recipe. I will bring you along when I leave the Jade Pure Sect and we will head to the Fiendish Cult. I will treat you well in the future. Under me, you will not suffer at all. If you have the aptitude and achieve good cultivation, we can even become companions.\"Sound transmission!Han Jue widened his eyes.This woman is actually a fiendish cultivator!Han Jue had no idea what to do.This was no joke. If he agreed, he would offend the entire Jade Pure Sect.If he refused, Xing Hongxuan would never let him leave the forest.Elder Iron wasn't here. This was only the outer sect of the Jade Pure Sect. No one would respond even if he shouted his lungs out.Xing Hongxuan didn't rush him. She walked around Han Jue and waited patiently.Han Jue was weighing his chances of winning against Xing Hongxuan.They were both at the seventh level of the Qi Refinement realm. Without magic and equipment, how could he defeat Xing Hongxuan?I can't resort to brute force.Han Jue pretended to be terrified and said, \"I don't know where that thing is. Moreover, Zhang Ge is there\u2026\"Xing Hongxuan looked satisfied. The fact that Han Jue didn't mention the alchemy recipe meant that he was smart.\"It's alright. I still have time. I can wait for you,\" Xing Hongxuan said with a smile.She took out a pill and said, \"This pill can help you unlock your cultivation potential. Take it, this is my greeting gift.\"Han Jue looked at the pill. It looked like chocolate.It was definitely poison!Not able to refuse, Han Jue placed it in his mouth.But he wrapped the pill with his spirit Qi to prevent it from melting.After swallowing it, Han Jue opened his mouth and deliberately showed it to Xing Hongxuan. He then said excitedly, \"Thank you, fairy-like miss! I will do my best!\"Damn it!For more, visit lightnovelworld.comWait for me to cultivate for another year and I will let you know how formidable I am!It was impossible for Han Jue to join the Fiendish Cult just like that.He wanted to live forever, not a risky life.Xing Hongxuan covered her mouth and smiled. She reached out to touch Han Jue's cheek and said with a smile, \"You're so sensible. Be good. I will groom you as my husband in the future.\"Han Jue showed excitement.But he was actually disgusted.Stupid bitch, do you think you are worthy of me?Xing Hongxuan rubbed his face for a while more before the two of them returned to the herb garden.The male cultivator looked at Han Jue suspiciously, frowning.Xing Hongxuan smiled mysteriously and continued her cultivation.As Han Jue walked into the herb garden, lines of words suddenly appeared before his eyes.[You were threatened by the fiendish cultivator Xing Hongxuan.

He took out a steamed bun and started eating.He had already abstained from eating ordinary meals, but to not cause suspicion, he had to pretend to eat.It was late at night.After the five slaves had fallen asleep, Han Jue continued to cultivate.Given his cultivation potential, it wouldn't be difficult for him to surpass Xing Hongxuan.For the next few days, Han Jue worked as usual.Zhang Ge had been cultivating in Elder Iron's residence, giving Han Jue an excuse to not enter.Xing Hongxuan seemed to be in no hurry.In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.[Name: Han Jue]Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experience[Lifespan: 18 / 85][Race: Mortal][Cultivation: 8th level of the Qi Refinement Realm][Technique: Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique (Can be inherited)][Magic: None][Mystical Power: None][Equipment: None][Cultivation Potential: Spiritual Physique of the Six Paths.

He immediately lay down and closed the barrier.\"I'm going to lure Zhang Ge away. You can go in and look for the item later.\"Xing Hongxuan's voice reached Han Jue's ears.He opened his eyes and hurriedly got up.Damn.I still can't run away from it.Han Jue waited patiently.Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.He, who was at the eighth level of Qi Refining, had already obtained a divine sense, and his normal senses were also extraordinary.He could faintly hear the sound of tables and chairs colliding in the distant pavilion.\"You can go now.\"Xing Hongxuan's voice flowed into his ear. Then, Han Jue sensed Xing Hongxuan and Zhang Ge rushing away from the roof.Han Jue quietly got up and prepared to put on a show.After carefully leaving the house, he looked towards the entrance of the herb garden and discovered that the male cultivator had fallen under a tree. He couldn't tell if the guy was dead or alive.\"What a weak guy.\"Han Jue couldn't help but ridicule him.He headed for the pavilion.Elder Iron's pavilion was two stories high, just like the villa. It was grand and magnificent, filled with all kinds of porcelain and paintings. After Han Jue entered the house, he began to wander around.He didn't put in any effort at all.Even if there was something he wanted, he had no place to keep it.After sitting for half an hour, Han Jue got up and continued to rummage through the drawers. He had to at least put on an act.Another half an hour passed.Xing Hongxuan returned.She rushed into the room and found him. \"Have you found it?\"Standing beside a vase, Han Jue turned around and said, \"I couldn't find it. I searched everywhere but couldn't find it.\"All of a sudden, he noticed that Xing Hongxuan was covered in blood.Had she killed Zhang Ge?Han Jue retreated subconsciously and accidentally knocked over the vase on the table.Ping\u2014The vase fell to the floor and shattered.Han Jue saw a manual appearing in the broken vase with two words carved on it.Alchemy recipe.Silence!The room was so quiet that a dropping needle would have been heard.Han Jue was stunned and felt extremely awkward.Erm\u2026Damn it!Is this how Elder Iron hides his things?Xing Hongxuan shifted her gaze from the alchemy recipe to him.

She walked around him, picked up the recipe, and began to flip through it.She seemed to be looking for something.Han Jue waited nervously.Should he make a move?If Xing Hongxuan took the recipe away, he wouldn't be able to obtain the sword technique.Xing Hongxuan seemed to be injured, and her breathing was unstable.Ambush her?So that she will back off and give up?Just as Han Jue was hesitating, a gust of cold wind swept through the door.Han Jue was caught off-guard and was sent flying, crashing into the wall and rebounding to the ground.Not really painful.Just a little scary.Han Jue stared in the direction. It was Elder Iron!He tilted his neck and shook his right leg vigorously. He was pretending to have passed out.\"Put down my alchemy recipe!\" Elder Iron said coldly.Xing Hongxuan talked back coldly, \"You're actually back!\"Elder Iron said expressionlessly, \"I've been back for a long time, but I've been waiting for you to show up. The last time I came back, I saw the two of you the moment I arrived. All these years, the other disciples have not accepted any of my missions, only the two of you have. There must be something fishy.\"With that, Elder Iron suddenly launched an attack at Xing Hongxuan, pushing his palm at her.In his palm was a talisman.As Xing Hongxuan instinctively jumped away, a lightning bolt shot out from Elder Iron's palm and wrapped around her.Elder Iron then kicked Xing Hongxuan, sending her flying backward.Almost instantly, Elder Iron snatched the alchemy recipe back.Xing Hongxuan landed on the ground, her body twitching uncontrollably.With his advantage, Elder Iron continued pursuing Xing Hongxuan, causing her to flee.The two of them zoomed out one after another.Lying on the ground, Han Jue hesitated whether he should get up.Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comNo!If he got up, he wouldn't be able to avoid suspicion.Han Jue also thought about escaping.But it was too dangerous. He didn't even know where to run to.So, he waited patiently.After an hour, Han Jue couldn't help but scratch his butt.Then, he suddenly felt an aura approaching the pavilion.It was Elder Iron!Han Jue didn't dare to move.As he entered the pavilion, Elder Iron noticed him and frowned.Han Jue suddenly coughed.Elder Iron walked to a nearby chair and sat down, quietly staring at him.Han Jue displayed the best and most realistic acting skills ever.He rubbed his head and got up.Looking around in confusion, he was pleasantly surprised to see Elder Iron.\"Elder Iron! You're finally back!\"Han Jue shrunk his neck and looked around nervously.He carefully asked, \"Then, where did the witch go?\"Elder Iron looked at him expressionlessly.Han Jue hurriedly stood up and lowered his head before Elder Iron, looking uneasy.Han Jue was gambling!He was gambling that Elder Iron didn't notice the communication between Xing Hongxuan and him.If he discovered it, Han Jue could only go all out.\"What did she tell you?\" Elder Iron asked.Han Jue didn't dare to hide anything and answered truthfully.\"Hmph. She wants to train you to be her husband. What a joke.\"Elder Iron was so angry that he laughed. This kid must be daydreaming.He examined Han Jue carefully.Huh.It's actually true.This kid had really become handsome. Just based on his looks and gaze, he wasn't inferior to those inner sect disciples at all.The changes were too great!Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comCould it be\u2026Elder Iron stretched out his hand and grabbed Han Jue's right wrist, pondering carefully.Nervous, Han Jue was ready to attack at any time.\"This kid doesn't have a cultivation potential or cultivation. Am I overthinking?\"Old Iron silently thought. Seeing Han Jue's fearful and anxious appearance, he couldn't help but think of his parents, and his mood immediately became irritable.He snapped. \"Go back to sleep!\"Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief, hurriedly bowed, then left the pavilion quickly.Elder Iron began to tidy up the room.\u2026Back in his room, Han Jue quietly went to bed.[As you did not help Xing Hongxuan steal the alchemy recipe, you successfully obtained the sword technique\u2014Unparalleled Finger Divine Sword]Han Jue was in a good mood. He finally had a life-saving technique!He immediately chose to inherit it.A wave of memories surged into his mind.The Unparalleled Finger Divine Sword wasn't considered a martial art, but a magical spell. He could brandish his finger as a sword, and the spirit Qi would transform into a blade.Han Jue was very talented with sword techniques and was able to master the magical spell in one night.However, he didn't expose himself and maintained a low profile.The next day.After Han Jue woke up, he heard the other servants say that Zhang Ge had died.It was said that he died a miserable death, bleeding from all seven orifices.The male cultivator guarding the herb garden also left early in the morning. Something big seemed to have happened last night.Han Jue couldn't help but mourn for Zhang Ge.[Xing Hongxuan's favorable impression of you has increased. She can become your companion.

This would be the source of his confidence in traveling the cultivation world.Along the way, Han Jue used his divine sense to search his surroundings as he walked.He was prepared to pay a visit to the Jade Pure Sect and become its disciple.The Jade Pure Sect probably wouldn't reject a cultivator at the ninth level of Qi Refinement Realm.The next morning.Han Jue finally found the Jade Pure Sect.The sect was located in a valley between mountains. Mysterious mist pervaded the air, and two huge stone statues flanked the gate. They looked like kirin statues.\"Stop right there. Show us your sect pass,\" said a disciple of the Jade Pure Sect as he raised his sword.A total of four disciples were guarding the entrance of the Jade Pure Sect, and all of them were at the fifth level of the Qi Refinement Realm.Han Jue turned off the concealment function and clasped his hands. \"I'm Han Jue, a rogue cultivator at the ninth level of Qi Refinement Realm. Do I have any way to join the Jade Pure Sect?\"The ninth level of Qi Refinement Realm!The four disciples' attitudes instantly changed.The sword-wielding disciple told the disciple beside him, and the latter disciple quickly left.\"Wait a moment. I've sent someone to inform the outer sect warden,\" said the sword-wielding disciple.Han Jue thanked him.In the Jade Pure Sect, other than Elder Iron, no other cultivator knew his name. Elder Iron had yet to return and might have died outside, so Han Jue wasn't worried about exposing his identity.In any case, he had done nothing to harm the Jade Pure Sect, so nothing was stopping him from joining the sect.Updated from lightnovelworld.comPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Brother Han, can you let me do a quick check? Fiendish cultivators occasionally tried to infiltrate the Jade Pure Sect in the past few years,\" the outer sect warden said politely, cupping his hands.Han Jue didn't have anything on him and wasn't afraid of a check.He raised his hands.Yang Luo began to feel around.After he finished searching, he asked doubtfully, \"Why do you not even have a storage ring or storage pouch?\"Han Jue helplessly said, \"I was attacked by a Foundation Establishment Realm fiendish cultivator on my way here. To stay alive\u2026 Ya, I'm sure you understand.\"Yang Luo was silent and looked at him sympathetically.\"Can you show your Spiritual Energy?\" Yang Luo asked.Han Jue could understand. It was to check if he was a fiendish cultivator.He immediately raised his right hand, wielding his finger like a sword and pointing towards the cliff at the side.Swish!A beam of Spirit Qi shot out from his index finger, piercing into the rocks.Yang Luo's eyes lit up.What kind of spell is this?He didn't ask, but he could feel that Han Jue wasn't a fiendish cultivator.\"No problem, follow me. I'll bring you to the outer sect for registration. From now on, you're an outer sect disciple of the Jade Pure Sect.\" Yang Luo smiled.Then, he led Han Jue into the valley.As Han Jue walked, he asked, \"How many outer sect disciples are there? What are the conditions to enter the inner sect?\"\"There are more than two thousand disciples in the outer sect. Only those who have reached Foundation Establishment can enter the inner sect. However, Foundation Establishment is very difficult. Every three years, the sect will hold a sect competition. The top three will all receive Foundation Establishment Pills. Foundation Establishment Pills can help a ninth layer Qi Refinement Realm cultivator breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm.\"\"Are there many inner sect disciples?\"\"I'm not sure about that. The Jade Pure Sect's inner sect is located in a Small World, we have no idea what's happening inside.\"This content is taken from lightnovelworld.com\"It seems like Jade Pure Sect is very powerful.\"\"Of course. The Jade Pure Sect is the most prestigious and established cultivation sect in the Great Yan.\"\"Does the Jade Pure Sect have places to cultivate with lightning and fire spiritual Qi?\"\"There aren't any in the outer sect, but there might be in the inner sect. If you have a Thunder Cultivation Potential, you can appeal to the Elder Hall. Perhaps they can make an exception and allow you to enter the inner sect. Having rare cultivation potentials like this is normally enough for the sect to especially nurture you.\"Yang Luo was secretly surprised. Could it be that this guy also had a Thunder Cultivation Potential?Han Jue's eyes brightened as he asked, \"As long as I have a Thunder Cultivation Potential?\"Yang Luo nodded.\"Brother Yang, can you nominate me? If I can enter the inner sect, I will never forget your kindness,\" Han Jue said in a low voice.He raised his right hand and sparks crackled in his palm.Yang Luo's pupils contracted.[The outer sect warden of the Jade Pure Sect, Yang Luo, has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1 star.]Yang Luo laughed. \"Since you're already calling me brother, I naturally have to help you with this matter. I'll make an exception and explain this to the Elder Hall.\"\"Thank you, Brother Yang. I'm very grateful!\"\"Sure, sure!\"Yang Luo had been stuck in the ninth level of the Qi Refinement Realm for twenty years. It was very difficult for him to make any more breakthroughs in his cultivation. The only thing he could do was to form connections.Following Yang Luo, Han Jue saw many outer sect disciples meditating along the way.The outer sect did not allocate special cultivation grounds and cave abodes for the disciples. Everyone just randomly found a place to practice their breathing techniques and were not to cause trouble.Soon, Han Jue arrived at the outer sect's buildings. Most of the buildings were very similar to Elder Iron's buildings and looked antique. There were also many disciples on the streets. Other than cultivators, there were also mortals.It turned out that there were also many mortal slaves in the cultivation sect. Slaves were not only needed by alchemists.Mortals were also willing to serve them. At the very least, they wouldn't encounter any life-threatening situations and would be able to fill their stomach.The Elder Hall was located in the center of the valley. It had four floors, and the entire place was filled with a strange fragrance.Han Jue followed Yang Luo in.Yang Luo walked to the counter and said, \"A ninth level Qi Refinement Realm cultivator wants to join our Jade Pure Sect.\"New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.comThe first floor wasn't big, and there was only an old man at the counter.The old man glanced at Han Jue, causing him to uncontrollably tense up.He couldn't tell the old man's cultivation level.Could he be a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator?\"Eh?\"The old man responded and turned around to take a small rectangular wooden block from the wooden cabinet behind him.Yang Luo asked in a low voice, \"Is the First Elder here? This person has a Thunder Cultivation Potential and wants to enter the inner court.\"Thunder Cultivation Potential?The old man looked at Han Jue in surprise.He waved his hand.Han Jue immediately walked up to the old man.At the same time, he made the system only reveal his thunder, fire, and wind cultivation potentials.Triple cultivation potential!The old man was shocked. \"Triple cultivation potential!\"Yang Luo wasn't surprised. Instead, he looked slightly envious.\"Register yourself first. You will be an outer sect disciple for the time being. When the First Elder returns, I will tell him about this matter,\" the old man said in a low voice.Han Jue started the registration.After that, Han Jue received the Sect Pass, a storage bag, a Jade Pure Sect Daoist robe, 100 low-grade spirit stones, and a bottle of Qi Condensation Pills.Yang Luo personally arranged for him to stay in a wooden house not far from his.\"Alright, Brother Han, you should rest first. Someone will inform you when there's news. I still have things to do.\" Yang Luo smiled.Han Jue cupped his fists and watched him leave.Yang Luo's attitude made him feel very real. It was different from what was written in novels.Even if Yang Luo wanted to form a good relationship with him, he wouldn't deliberately try to please him.For more, visit lightnovelworld.comThey were all cultivators. He wasn't going to be a simp just because Han Jue had better potential.Han Jue closed the door and started to cultivate.He could finally cultivate without any worries!Something surprising happened again.He could actually sense fire spiritual Qi here!Han Jue decided to first cultivate his fire cultivation potential to the ninth level of the Qi Refinement Realm.Generally speaking, cultivators would only choose one technique to cultivate. Most cultivation techniques only had a single elemental attribute. Very few people would cultivate with six elemental attributes like Han Jue.Han Jue's cultivation potential was top-notch and he didn't feel tired at all.He enjoyed the feeling of becoming stronger.More accurately, it was the feeling of his lifespan increasing.When Han Jue saw the attributes panel, his first thought was to live forever.He didn't want fame or fortune!He didn't want to marry a beauty!He only wanted to live for very long. He didn't want to suffer from a terminal disease and die at a young age again!\"With my cultivation potential, I don't need to take risks and seek opportunities. I need to cultivate diligently and never cause trouble. If I can avoid provoking my enemies, then I shouldn't provoke them unless they want to kill me.\"Han Jue thought silently.\u2026Half a year passed in the blink of an eye.Han Jue's fire cultivation had reached the fourth level of the Qi Refinement Realm.The outer sect First Elder finally returned, and Yang Luo personally came to inform him.Han Jue packed up his things, tied the storage bag on his waist, and followed him to the Elder Hall.\"Initially, the Elder Hall had already forgotten about this matter. I happened to pass by your door and noticed that you were still cultivating, so I suddenly remembered it. I'm sure the First Elder would like a diligent cultivator like you.\" Yang Luo smiled.His tone was full of admiration.Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comHan Jue didn't open his door for half a year.If not for the spiritual Qi fluctuation inside, others would have thought that it was an empty room.Han Jue smiled and said, \"Many thanks, Brother Yang.

He had a smile on his face and his eyes curved into two lines.He sized up Han Jue and said with satisfaction, \"His temperament is comparable to inner sect disciples and almost equivalent to an elite disciple.\"The Jade Pure Sect robe was white with blue stripes. After Han Jue wore it, his charm was completely unleashed. He didn't look like a servant at all.Many female cultivators peeped at him on the way here.\"I cannot be compared to the elite disciples,\" Han Jue said humbly.The Grand Elder smiled and said, \"Let's go. Follow me to the inner sect. If you want to join the inner sect, you have to find a master. There are eighteen peaks and eighteen missionary elders in the inner sect. If anyone is fond of you, you can directly become an inner sect disciple. If not, you can only participate in the outer sect competition and strive to reach Foundation Establishment as soon as possible.\"\"I understand.\"The two of them then left the Elder Hall.The old man at the counter clicked his tongue in wonder. \"This child's fire-attribute Spiritual Energy has increased by quite a bit. It seems that he has been diligently cultivating for half a year.\"Yang Luo laughed. \"That's right, he didn't leave his room even once. He has good talent and is willing to cultivate diligently. Who knows, he might even become an elite disciple in the future.\"The old man shook his head and laughed. He didn't say anything else.He had been here for more than a hundred years and had seen geniuses more talented than Han Jue. He only felt a little emotional but didn't think too much about it.\u2026They didn't speak on the way.Following the First Elder, Han Jue arrived at a teleportation formation in the corner of the valley. Several disciples were guarding this place.The teleportation formation was very much like an altar. It was a circular stone platform with strange patterns engraved on it. Stone pillars were erected in all directions, and there were many irregular dents on them, which were especially used to insert spirit stones.This was Han Jue's first time using a teleportation formation. He was very nervous, but he didn't dare to show it, afraid of embarrassing himself.The outer sect disciples began placing spirit stones.\"What kind of training style do you prefer?\" the First Elder suddenly asked. \"The various peaks have different cultures because of the different personalities of the coaching elders. Some are competitive, some are low-key, and some are out on missions all year round.\"Han Jue replied, \"I'm a low-profile cultivator. I don't like crowds and I don't like being high-profile.\"Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.The First Elder revealed a strange smile and said, \"Then, I'll bring you to the Jade Serene Peak first.\"At this moment, the teleportation formation was activated and a strong light burst out, causing Han Jue to close his eyes.Han Jue felt a strong sense of weightlessness. Any other mortal would have vomited.About three seconds passed.Han Jue opened his eyes, and what he saw was a mountain peak that reached into the clouds. The sea of clouds filled his vision, and he felt as if he were standing on a cloud.Under his feet was the teleportation formation, and in front of him was a stone step that led to the city.The city was located on a lower peak compared to the surrounding eighteen mountain peaks. However, when Han Jue looked down from the teleportation formation, it was like a ten thousand-foot-high cliff. Due to the clouds and mist, he couldn't see the ground.The city on the lower peak was very big. Many cultivators could be seen flying with their swords in the sky. There were even various kinds of ferocious birds.\"That's the inner sect of the Jade Pure Sect. You can do missions and collect your salary here. You can also trade inside.\"The First Elder introduced the inner sect with a proud tone.Han Jue was stunned. He had thought that the Jade Pure Sect was a small sect like in the cultivation dramas. He didn't expect it to be so big.He thought he had arrived at an Immortal World.He had truly underestimated the strength of the Jade Pure Sect.After all, he had been staying in the herb garden for the past twenty years, and his activity was limited to a radius of two kilometers. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call him a caged bird.The First Elder waved his hand. Han Jue felt something lifting him and almost fell.He looked down and saw a huge gourd under his feet.\"Stand firm. If you fall, you'll die even if you're at the ninth level of the Qi Refinement Realm.\"The First Elder laughed heartily.Han Jue quickly covered the bottom of his feet with spiritual force to stick himself to the gourd's surface.The huge gourd carried them towards one of the taller peaks.The other huge peaks had disciples traveling in and out, and only this one seemed inactive.\"The coaching elder of Jade Serene Peak is Fairy Xi Xuan. Her cultivation level is unfathomable. She likes to cultivate in seclusion, with peace and silence. Therefore, Jade Serene Peak is not lively. In addition, she doesn't allow her disciples to develop feelings for each other and become companions. Therefore, there are very few disciples.

He was probably using a voice transmission technique.Boom!The front door opened.The First Elder led Han Jue in.The hall was dark. As they walked in, the oil lamps on both sides lit up.Han Jue's gaze landed on the two figures meditating in front.Two female cultivators.One of the female cultivators wore a blue robe and had a graceful bearing. Her appearance could be described as devastatingly beautiful. She was probably Fairy Xi Xuan.The female cultivator behind her should be a disciple. Her temperament and appearance were quite different, but she was still a beauty.Fairy Xi Xuan opened her eyes and looked at Han Jue.As the First Elder approached, he smiled and said, \"This child's name is Han Jue. He's an itinerant cultivator with a triple cultivation potential and also possesses a rare thunder cultivation potential.

From now on, you can call me Senior Chang. You're a newcomer, so if there's anything you don't understand, feel free to ask me.\"Chang Yue'er smiled and met Han Jue's gaze.

It had been years since Jade Serene Peak had a new disciple.Since she had already said that, Han Jue didn't want to be pretentious.He had to agree that Senior Chang had a slim waist.\u2026Two hours later.Chang Yue'er brought Han Jue to a cave entrance and said, \"Inside is your cave abode. My cave abode is right beside it. You can cultivate in peace.\"So close?Han Jue looked in the direction she pointed. The entrance of her cave was 100 meters away.Han Jue sighed in his head, but he still thanked Chang Yue'er.The two bid farewell.After entering the cave, Han Jue saw a knob on the wall of the cave. After twisting it, a stone door closed at the entrance of the cave. Immediately after, the cave lit up.He walked towards the end of the tunnel. The cave was about a hundred square meters. There was a bed, a table, and a wooden cabinet. He was treated well.Han Jue sat on the bed and took out the newly obtained inner sect storage bag.The inner sect's storage bag was ten times larger than the outer sect's storage bag. It had a space of 100 cubic meters.He obtained Jade Serene Peak's Daoist robe, a flying sword, a flying sword technique manual, Jade Serene Peak's token, a hundred middle-grade spirit stones, and a bottle of Qi Condensation Pills.Through Chang Yue'er, Han Jue learned that a high-grade spirit stone was equivalent to a hundred middle-grade spirit stones. A middle-grade spirit stone was equivalent to a hundred low-grade spirit stones.Spirit stones could be used for cultivation or currency.He immediately retrieved the one thousand superior-grade spirit stones from his attribute panel and placed them into his storage bag.This amount of spirit stones was enough to make Han Jue rich.The providence of being the descendant of an Immortal Emperor was indeed amazing.

Otherwise, he would have to hug onto his senior's slim waist whenever he needed to go down the mountain.His top-notch sword technique talent allowed him to master the flying sword technique in an hour.He dripped blood on the flying sword to make it recognize him as the owner. This method was recorded in the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique.After everything was done, he walked out of the cave abode and stepped on his flying sword. He began to circle Jade Serene Peak to familiarize himself with the flying sword technique.In the Jade Serene Hall.Fairy Xi Xuan suddenly opened her eyes as a strange look flashed across them.\"Is this really the first time this kid has cultivated the flying sword technique?\"She had eavesdropped on Han Jue and Chang Yue'er's conversation before.Was he lying?If he was lying, why would he suddenly display his flying sword technique now?Fairy Xi Xuan couldn't figure it out and decided to observe for a while longer.After Han Jue flew dozens of rounds, he quickly returned to his cave abode to cultivate.This content is taken from lightnovelworld.comHe started to cultivate his fire spiritual power.[You have successfully become an inner disciple of the Jade Pure Sect and started your first cultivation after entering the sect.

He knelt in front of the door and said, \"Master, I have something to ask of you.\"He didn't raise his voice. He was sure that Fairy Xi Xuan could hear him.Before long, the door opened.Han Jue walked into the hall at a medium pace.He walked up to Fairy Xi Xuan and knelt, saying, \"I have cultivated my wind cultivation potential and fire cultivation to the ninth level of the Qi Refinement realm.

However, one needs ten mid-grade spirit stones to stay in the Thunder Spiritual Pool for a day.\"At first glance, it looked cheap, but for cultivators, how could a day be enough?Han Jue said in surprise, \"Thank you for your guidance, Master.

Han Jue was the youngest and had to address everyone as a senior.Different from what he had imagined, there were other male disciples in Jade Serene Peak as well. There were quite a number of them, and all of them looked imposing.There was approximately an equal number of male and female disciples.Reaching Jade Serene Hall's gate, they knelt and waited patiently.During this time, Han Jue was sized up by the others.The female disciples all smiled at him.But no one developed a favorability towards him.These disciples had already cultivated here for many years, unlike Chang Yue'er who had only joined the Jade Serene Peak a few years earlier than Han Jue.Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.More and more disciples arrived.When the gate opened, Han Jue counted fifty-six disciples in total.Even the most downtrodden Jade Serene Peak had so many disciples, let alone the other peaks.Most of the disciples were stronger than Han Jue, so he couldn't see through their cultivation.After entering the hall, Han Jue made sure he was at the back.As the junior, he naturally had to be ranked last so as to avoid offending some petty seniors.Mats had already been placed in two rows within the hall, allowing the disciples to sit facing each other.Han Jue sat at the back, facing Chang Yue'er.She winked at him like a child.Childish!Han Jue quietly raised his middle finger.Chang Yue'er didn't understand this gesture.

He was chosen by the Sect Master to be especially groomed, so I couldn't find him.\"Han Jue raised his eyebrows.It's over?Crap.He had cultivated for too long and forgot such a major event. He hoped that Fairy Xi Xuan would not blame him.\"If what you said is true, why aren't the sect leaders personally going to retrieve this cave abode?\" Han Jue asked.Mo Zhu shrugged and said, \"His cave abode isn't that important to the sect. However, to us Foundation Establishment Cultivators, it's a huge opportunity.\"Han Jue asked, \"How did you know about this?\"\"A friend of mine told me. It isn't on the mission board.\"It must be a trap!Definitely not going!Han Jue immediately refused. \"It's too dangerous. I'm not going. Let me give you a piece of advice. Don't participate, or you'll die very miserably!\"With that, he turned around and left.\"You\u2026\"Mo Zhu stomped her feet in anger.However, it didn't negatively affect her impression of Han Jue.

Could there really be danger?Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.\u2026After returning to the Jade Serene Peak, Han Jue went to the Jade Serene Hall and knelt at the gate.The inner sect competition was an important event. If he was the only one who didn't go spectate from the Jade Serene Peak, he would be in huge trouble.\"Come in, I have something to talk to you about.\"Fairy Xi Xuan's voice drifted over as the door opened.After entering the hall, Han Jue discovered that Fairy Xi Xuan wasn't alone. Chang Yue'er and an old man were also present.Wait!This old man\u2026He's Elder Iron!Han Jue was stunned but continued to move forward.Upon seeing him, Elder Iron's face froze in confusion.\"This kid is a disciple of the Jade Serene Peak as well? How can this be possible!?\"Elder Iron was in disbelief.\"This is a new disciple of the Jade Serene Peak. He will be your junior from now on. You can just call him Junior Iron,\" said Fairy Xi Xuan.Han Jue nodded and looked at Elder Iron. \"Junior Iron, if you have any trouble in the future, feel free to look for me.\"Elder Iron gritted his teeth and said, \"Han Jue, how did you become an inner sect disciple?!\"He was shocked to find that he couldn't see through Han Jue's cultivation.In just over twenty years, Han Jue had surpassed him from a mere mortal?Fairy Xi Xuan wasn't surprised that they knew each other. Instead, she asked, \"Why are you still at the third level of the Foundation Establishment realm?\"Third level of the Foundation Establishment realm!Elder Iron was even more shocked. He had worked so hard to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm, but Han Jue was already at the third level?Han Jue was afraid that Elder Iron would sabotage him, so he had to demonstrate his value to Fairy Xi Xuan. Thus, he no longer hid his cultivation level. \"Master, I'm already at the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment Realm. I just wanted to keep a low profile, so I hid my cultivation level.\"Elder Iron and Chang Yue'er widened their eyes upon hearing that.\"Junior! How did you break through so quickly?\" Chang Yue'er exclaimed.She literally watched Han Jue leap from the ninth level of the Qi Refinement realm to the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm.Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experienceIt was too ridiculous!Han Jue explained, \"I've been cultivating in the Thunder Spiritual Pool and didn't dare to slack off. That's why I made such progress.\"Fairy Xi Xuan smiled in satisfaction and said, \"If everyone on the Jade Serene Peak was as hardworking as you, Jade Serene Peak would definitely become the strongest peak of the Jade Pure Sect.\"[You kept a low profile to cultivate. You have successfully obtained Fairy Xi Xuan's recognition.

I just like to cultivate. That's all.\"Elder Iron tried his best to calm down.He knew that he couldn't suppress Han Jue anymore.It was best to forget what happened in the past. If he told Fairy Xi Xuan about it, she might become unhappy with him.He suddenly felt nervous.With Han Jue's cultivation, killing him was as easy as flipping his hand.No!He had to resolve this grudge!\"Since you like to cultivate so much, I will assign you a mission to guard the Jade Pure Sect's Ten Thousand Demon Realm.\" Fairy Xi Xuan's smile suddenly turned incomprehensible.Ten Thousand Demon Realm\u2026It sounded so awesome and so dangerous!Han Jue instinctively wanted to decline, but he still asked carefully, \"Master, what's the Ten Thousand Demon Realm?\"Chang Yue'er said excitedly, \"It's the place where the Jade Pure Sect raises its beasts. Master, I want to go too. Let me accompany Junior Han so that he won't be bullied!\"Fairy Xi Xuan glared at her, scaring her so much that she didn't dare to say anything else.\"Every peak will send a disciple to guard the Ten Thousand Demon Realm. Because there are many kinds of beasts in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm, the Spirit Qi there is concentrated. It's a very suitable place for you to cultivate, but dangers also exist. There are often cases where the beasts go berserk and disciples are brutally killed,\" Fairy Xi Xuan explained to him.She spoke with a tone that left no way for Han Jue to decline it. But, the silver lining was that it was a good place for him to cultivate.Fighting beasts was better than contesting with other people.Isn't it just being a zookeeper? Fine!\"I will follow Master's arrangements.\" Han Jue cupped his hands.Fairy Xi Xuan nodded and said, \"Pack up and head straight to the Pet Beast Pavilion. Someone will bring you to the Ten Thousand Demon Realm. The previous one stationed there is your First Senior. Now that he's under the Sect Master, only you can go. If the mission is successful, I will reward you. In addition, you will receive ten superior-grade spirit stones for every year you guard the Ten Thousand Demon Realm.

That would be his residence. There were forbidding spells cast on the pavilion, and ordinary beasts wouldn't dare to approach.Of course, he couldn't hide in the pavilion forever. If he encountered a rampage, he had to take action to reduce the losses for the Jade Pure Sect.The Jade Pure Sect had spent a lot of money to buy all the beasts in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm, and nurturing them also required a lot of resources.The pavilion wasn't far from the teleportation formation, and Han Jue quickly found it.It was two stories high, and it wasn't very big.

Han Jue could only pray for her silently.\"Roar!\"Suddenly, a roar came from outside the pavilion. Han Jue frowned and stood up immediately.As he walked out the door, he saw a white cat standing on a branch.This white cat had a slender figure, but there were white tiger patterns on it. Its purple eyes looked even more demonic.Han Jue didn't sense any danger and ignored the little white cat.At this moment!The white cat suddenly pounced on Han Jue.Han Jue instinctively used the Seven Illusionary Steps to dodge.The white cat slammed into the wall of the pavilion, kicked off with its four legs, turned around, and continued to pounce on Han Jue.Han Jue frowned.

The big ones were as big as hills, while the small ones were all kinds of insect-like beasts the size of a pail.This was the first time Han Jue saw a scene like this. He couldn't help but pale.He estimated that there were at least a thousand beasts.If all of them were to charge at the pavilion he was in, there was no way for him to defend it.

I nearly died.\"Han Jue asked, \"Are there many beasts nearby?\"\"There's a group of beasts several kilometers away, but I don't know who trapped them with an array formation. They aren't a threat.

Junior, let me help you. I've learned how to dissect beasts. It's the only way I can thank you,\" Chang Yue'er said enthusiastically.Han Jue thought for a while and nodded.Having a helping hand could boost efficiency.After about five minutes, the two of them cleaned up the carcasses and left quickly.As they traveled, Chang Yue'er was very excited.However, when they started talking about Meng He, she gritted her teeth.\"Seventh Senior is going overboard! No! He doesn't deserve to be our Seventh Senior! When I go back, I must complain to Master!\"I hope he gets eaten up by beasts!\"Junior, where are we going next?\"Han Jue was also very hesitant.It was really too dangerous!Forget it!\"Let's go back. At most, we'll kneel before Master and apologize,\" Han Jue said seriously.Although ordinary beasts couldn't hurt him, what if a Demon King and members of the Cult appeared?Chang Yue'er asked hesitantly, \"Is this really okay?\"\"If you think it's bad, then stay!\"\"No! I'll go back with you!\"The two of them rushed towards the teleportation formation.For more, visit lightnovelworld.comBefore long, they found it.There were more than ten cultivators gathered before the teleportation formation.Meng He was among them.He was stunned upon seeing them. He hurriedly put on a surprised smile and said, \"Junior Brother! Junior Sister! You're actually still alive. That's great!\"Chang Yue'er gritted her teeth in anger. She wanted to curse at Meng He.Han Jue raised his hand, signaling her not to.He suddenly caught sight of Mo Fuchou.\"Brother Han, why are you here?\" Mo Fuchou asked with a smile.He noticed Chang Yue'er's expression and couldn't help but glance at Meng He.Meng He sensed Mo Fuchou's gaze and felt extremely awkward. He forced a smile.\"Master arranged for me to come. By the way, your sister, Mo Zhu, is in trouble. She went to Li Qianlong's cave abode to search for treasures. I tried to persuade her against it, but she still went,\" Han Jue said as he walked to the teleportation formation.Chang Yue'er followed closely behind. The two of them took out spirit stones and activated the formation to leave.Mo Fuchou frowned, his expression changing.Someone beside him asked, \"Who is this person? A disciple of Jade Serene Peak? Why haven't I seen him before?\"Meng He replied, \"Yes, he's my fellow disciple at Jade Serene Peak. He's called Han Jue. He's highly regarded by Master. Previously, Master wanted him to join the Sect Leader's core candidates, but he rejected her.\"Upon hearing that, everyone was shocked.Mo Fuchou's eyes flickered. \"He's indeed worthy!\"\u2026After returning to the inner sect, Han Jue and Chang Yue'er went to sell the materials they obtained from the beasts.There was a dedicated market in the inner sect for transacting materials from beasts. What surprised Han Jue was that these materials were sold for 397 superior-grade spirit stones.\"Is killing beasts so profitable?\" Han Jue said excitedly. He suddenly wanted to turn back and continue killing the beasts.Chang Yue'er hurriedly stopped him and said in a low voice, \"Junior, don't think about it. The Ten Thousand Demon Realm is a small world specially designed by the sect to nurture beasts. The beasts inside are all valuable. Under normal circumstances, disciples are not allowed to kill them. This time, the situation is special. We might not be held responsible, but it will definitely be very troublesome next time.\"Han Jue realized he had been too imaginative.He should just stay in seclusion and cultivate as usual.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comThe two of them returned to the Jade Serene Peak and first visited Fairy Xi Xuan.After the door opened, the two of them entered the hall to kneel before her.\"Why did you return?\" Fairy Xi Xuan asked with a frown.Han Jue replied, \"I discovered that the Ten Thousand Demon Realm is too dangerous. There are demon kings and the Cult. We were attacked by beasts and I even offended the son of a demon king. I really can't stay there anymore.\"Master, please punish me! I'm willing to face the wall and repent for a hundred years!\"Fairy Xi Xuan was speechless.Chang Yue'er looked at him with a strange expression.A hundred years?That's really extreme!\"What if you are not allowed to cultivate within the hundred years?\" Fairy Xi Xuan asked.Han Jue's face froze.Chang Yue'er promptly said, \"Master, when we were attacked by the beasts, Seventh Senior Meng He abandoned us and ran away!\"The mention of this infuriated her.However, Fairy Xi Xuan didn't get angry. She remained calm and said, \"Don't you think it's just because you are too weak? You can't force your senior to stay behind and die with you.\"\"Errrmmm\u2026\"Chang Yue'er wanted to say something but hesitated, unable to say anything.It was the cruel truth.Meng He didn't hurt them. He just wanted to protect himself.Fairy Xi Xuan said, \"Yue'er, you should leave first.\"Chang Yue'er glanced at Han Jue, then bowed and left.When Han Jue and Fairy Xi Xuan were the only ones left in the hall, a murderous aura spread out.Han Jue was shocked.What's Master trying to do?He didn't dare to raise his head and looked very well-behaved.This content is taken from lightnovelworld.com\"Han Jue, what are you cultivating for?\" Fairy Xi Xuan asked. Her voice was cold and emotionless.\"For immortality.\"\"If you keep cultivating in seclusion, you won't be able to live forever.

I'll try my luck when I'm strong enough.\"Master!You don't understand!I have unparalleled cultivation potential and four top-notch connate providences!Han Jue thought silently.Only people with insufficient talent needed to compete for opportunities.Fairy Xi Xuan continued, \"I originally arranged an opportunity for you. If you succeed in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm this time, you will definitely become a core disciple in the future. The treatment you will receive will also be far better than now. Unfortunately, you have given up.\"\"Thank you, Master. I can only blame myself for not having the fortune.\"\"The cultivation technique you are using is unfathomable, and I have nothing much to teach you. How about this, do you want to have a cave abode on par with the Thunder Spiritual Pool? It even has other types of Spirit Qi apart from Thunder Spirit Qi.\"Hearing this, Han Jue suddenly raised his head and asked in surprise, \"Where?\"Fairy Xi Xuan said with an expressionless face, \"Recently, the Jade Pure Sect discovered three more Connate cave abodes. These cave abodes are not created by cultivators, but the creation of heaven and earth. They're near the sect. If you want to obtain a Connate cave abode, you must participate in the inner sect assessment that's held once every ten years. Anyone below the core disciple level can participate. If you can obtain one of the top three spots, you will be able to obtain a Connate cave abode. The winner gets to choose first.\"Han Jue frowned.Fairy Xi Xuan glared at him and said unhappily, \"Don't tell me you're even afraid of fighting? It's not like anyone will harm your life!\"Han Jue hesitated for a moment before asking, \"Master, under normal circumstances, do Golden Core disciples participate?\"\"Do you think cultivators of the Golden Core realm are as common as cabbages?

Instead, he headed to the inner sect's spiritual pools to cultivate.Since he was participating in the inner sect assessments, he would have to fight for the top three places!With a connate cave abode, he would no longer have to worry about the lack of Spirit Qi. He would be able to stay in his cave abode forever.Before that, he had to increase his cultivation as much as possible.He had asked Fairy Xi Xuan about it. There were still eight years until the next inner sect assessment.Han Jue went to the Fire Spiritual Pool first and paid for a year.There were quite a few disciples in the Fire Spiritual Pool. About twenty to thirty of them. Han Jue found a corner and began to meditate and cultivate.His appearance attracted the attention of some female disciples.\"That person is so handsome.\"\"Could it be that mysterious, handsome disciple from Jade Serene Peak?\"\"Maybe. I've never seen anyone so good-looking before.\"\"I wish I knew him.\"Han Jue could hear their discussion, but he pretended not to.Without a woman in my heart, I can cultivate insanely fast!\u2026A year later.Han Jue's fire cultivation potential had reached the eighth level of the Foundation Establishment realm.Perhaps because his thunder cultivation potential had already reached the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm, he was able to cultivate his other spirit powers faster than before.Han Jue hurried to the Water Spiritual Pool next.Just like that, another four years passed.All his remaining cultivation potentials had reached the eighth level of the Foundation Establishment realm!There were three years left.He continued to cultivate.He would strive to reach the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm before the inner sect assessment!Wind Spiritual Pool.The moment Han Jue entered, he saw a group of disciples gathered.\"Zhou Fan, didn't you say that you would surpass us in the next inner sect assessment?

If we beat him up now, maybe Junior Lu will be more than happy.\"Han Jue shook his head at their discussion and then found a corner to cultivate.Such conflicts weren't rare in the Jade Pure Sect.Although the Jade Pure Sect was a righteous sect, where there were people, there would always be conflicts.Han Jue had seen that more than once before.\"Hmph, you bunch of trash dare to take on me here?

I have reason to suspect that you're traitors from the Cult, so I'll report you to the Elders!\"A cold snort followed, sounding very stubborn.Han Jue opened his eyes and looked over. The person who spoke was the person surrounded, Zhou Fan.[Detected Connate Providence, checking its origin.]A line of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue, stunning him.Connate providence?He immediately chose to check.[Zhou Fan, the reincarnation of a Mahayana cultivator, was born in a town in the mortal world.

The Numinous Treasure is severely injured because it protected him. Now, in order to repair itself, the Numinous Treasure unconsciously absorbs Spirit Qi while Zhou Fan cultivates, causing his cultivation speed to be extremely slow. Currently, the Numinous Treasure is about to be successfully repaired.]Han Jue's expression turned strange.That's an impressive background.He could be a protagonist in a novel.He narrowed his eyes and looked over. Surrounded, Zhou Fan's expression was calm. Even though he was being pushed around, he didn't seem angry at all. Although he wasn't handsome, he gave off a determined and mature aura.Should I help this protagonist?Of course not!Han Jue closed his eyes.No matter how impressive Zhou Fan's background was, it had nothing to do with him.On the contrary, with such a bearer of connate providence around him, he wanted to cultivate even harder.Han Jue's goal was immortality and invincibility.When he became invincible, he could do whatever he wanted.At the moment, he should stay clear from trouble.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comThe group of disciples spat at Zhou Fan for a while, but in the end, they were frightened off by him and didn't dare to do much.They had already spent a lot of money to be here. If they were to delay any longer, they would be at a disadvantage.The Wind Spiritual Pool fell back into silence.A year later.Han Jue's wind cultivation potential had reached the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm.He stood up and left.When he arrived at the Wind Spiritual Pool Pavilion, he coincidentally met Zhou Fan again.He was talking to a beautiful girl in green.Han Jue noticed that Zhou Fan's hands in his sleeves were tightly clenched into fists, obviously restraining his emotions.The girl in green was calmer in comparison, and she quickly turned and left.Zhou Fan stood where he was with trembling shoulders.Han Jue could roughly guess what happened.He walked over and brushed past him.Zhou Fan was still angry. When he saw Han Jue, he frowned.\"Stop right there!\" Zhou Fan shouted.As soon as these words were spoken, the surrounding disciples stopped moving.Han Jue didn't stop. He quickly walked out of the pavilion and prepared to head to the other spiritual pools.Zhou Fan suddenly blocked his way.Han Jue raised his eyebrows and asked, \"What's the matter, brother?\"\"Are you Han Jue?\"\"Yeah. You know me?\"\"I'm Zhou Fan of the Heavenly Thunder Peak. Senior Mo often mentions you. He said that you must be the future mighty cultivator of the Jade Pure Sect.\"Han Jue sweated.

He took a deep breath and said, \"I've heard that you're very well-liked by the girls. When Junior Mo Zhu mentions you, her eyes literally glitter.

He had no idea what the situation in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm was.Han Jue immediately replied using telepathy, \"No. Why, senior?\"Telepathy was very simple. A Foundation Establishment realm cultivator only needed to grasp some techniques and they would learn it very quickly.\"Under our Sect Master's lead, I hid in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm for the past few years. We encountered the Cult attempting to capture the Tiger Heart White Dragon. There was a huge battle, but with the Sect Master with us, we claimed victory without any casualties. Later, the Sect Leader told us that it was only so easy because he had received information from a converted spy in the Cult. That's why he pretended to leave the Sect but hid in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm.\"The converted spy is Xing Hongxuan. When she was young, the Cult forced her to take some poison, which they used to threaten her to become a spy in the Sect. However, she had always been unwilling and hated it. So, she even tried to steal a recipe from an outer sect alchemist to find an antidote. But that was a naive move. How can pills from an outer sect alchemist work against poison concocted by the Cult?\"After that, she decided to leave the Viridescent Nether Cult. But they tried to hunt her down. The Sect Master happened to be investigating spies from the Viridescent Nether Cult and saved her. Because she never harmed the Jade Pure Sect and she contributed in this latest operation to defeat the Cult, the Sect Master allowed her to join the inner sect as a disciple.\"Han Jue was flabbergasted by the story. Lucky that he could conceal his emotions.\"Xing Hongxuan is currently cultivating with us at the main peak. Her master is Daoist Jingxu. Daoist Jingxu is Sect Master's junior. She's in charge of the main peak and personally guides the core candidates. Previously, when we met Xing Hongxuan, she was asking around about a disciple named Han Jue and told us about their story. Interestingly, the outer sect alchemist previously mentioned has become a disciple of our peak. Even more surprising is that the alchemist had a servant named Han Jue. And we also have a Han Jue here!\"Junior Han, what a coincidence!\"Liu Sanxin looked at him teasingly.Han Jue felt awkward and didn't know how to reply.That woman actually let out everything!But it's fine.Right now, he was already an inner sect disciple at the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm.

I had no choice then.\"\"Haha, I understand. It's just that I didn't expect that you would have such cultivation potential.\"Liu Sanxin joked, and Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.Han Jue couldn't help but glance at Elder Iron.They had been using telepathy, so no one could hear their conversation.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comElder Iron had his head lowered and Han Jue couldn't make out his face.Han Jue opened his attributes panel and checked his interpersonal relationships.[Xing Hongxuan: Ninth level of the Qi Refinement realm, can become a companion.

Does she have some other secret identity?At this moment.The doors to the Jade Serene Hall opened and all the disciples stood up to enter.After sitting down, they all looked towards Fairy Xi Xuan.Fairy Xi Xuan asked, \"The inner sect assessment is about to begin. Every peak must send at least ten disciples. Who is willing to participate this time?\"Six disciples immediately raised their hands, including Chang Yue'er.Han Jue found it strange that Fairy Xi Xuan didn't mention anything about the connate cave abode.If it was mentioned, they would probably be fighting to participate.Is it some special reward from Fairy Xi Xuan?As he thought, Han Jue raised his hand silently.The disciples were surprised to see that.\"Wow, Junior Han is actually participating!\"Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.\"Hahaha, I thought he was going to continue his seclusion.\"\"That should be the case.

So, many people knew that there was an extremely handsome young disciple from Jade Serene Peak. When the disciples heard about the rumors going around, they guessed that it was Han Jue.Over time, even though Han Jue kept a low profile, there were already rumors about him in the inner sect.He became famous because of his good looks!When Elder Iron saw how popular Han Jue was, his expression became even more complex.He was still a nobody in the Jade Serene Peak.After this matter was settled, Fairy Xi Xuan let the disciples leave, leaving Han Jue alone.The disciples looked at Han Jue enviously.It was obvious that Master thought highly of him. He was given special treatment!The doors closed.Han Jue looked up at Fairy Xi Xuan.He had to admit that Master was really beautiful.Han Jue had been in the inner sect for decades, but he had never seen a female cultivator more beautiful than Fairy Xi Xuan.However, Fairy Xi Xuan's aura was so powerful that no one dared to profane her.Han Jue only exclaimed and didn't have any other thoughts.The disciples are not as good-looking as their master.

What kind of talent was this?Most importantly, she had never taught him.She was very curious where he had obtained such cultivation technique.\"I really can't hide anything from you, Master,\" Han Jue replied.His flattery was obvious, but it had little effect.Fairy Xi Xuan said, \"Your cultivation techniques and sword techniques are all very good, but they aren't the techniques of the Jade Pure Sect. You must have learned it from someone else. I know that you have been diligently cultivating and have no intention of harming the sect. Some people testify that you were born in the outer sect, which means that you ran into a huge opportunity when you were young. But, everyone is destined to run into opportunities of all sorts. So, I won't ask further.\"\"For this inner sect assessment, you can demonstrate your strength without any worries. You don't have to be afraid of attracting trouble. I'm still very well respected in the sect.\"Han Jue quickly thanked her.He was actually a little worried previously.Now, he wasn't afraid anymore.He would use the Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique blatantly!Based on the relationship between Fairy Xi Xuan and Sect Master, Sect Master probably thought the same of him. Or perhaps, these were Li Qingzi's ideas in the first place.The greater Han Jue's potential, the happier the Jade Pure Sect was.\"To avoid unnecessary trouble, from today onwards, you're my personal disciple. I will report this to the sect.\" Fairy Xi Xuan spoke again.Personal disciple!Han Jue looked up and was surprised.Although Fairy Xi Xuan had dozens of disciples under her, most of them were under the sect.

But it was unique in the sense that it formed a seal that could expel devils.And activating this magic with spirit energy of different attributes would have different effects.Although Han Jue didn't possess a top-notch potential in sealing techniques, his unparalleled cultivation potential made his learning smooth.Seven days later.Han Jue had finally inherited the magic.It was very close to the inner sect assessment. The coaching elder of each peak had submitted the list of participants.Chang Yue'er visited him to tell him the rules of the assessment.Each peak would set up an arena, and disciples would go from peak to peak to compete. When the top ten emerged, they would compete in the inner sect city for everyone in the sect to spectate.Han Jue liked it.This way, he would only need to fight about four times. Even if he attracted attention, it wouldn't last.\"Junior, the personal disciples from each peak are having a banquet. Do you want to go?\" Chang Yue'er asked.Interestingly, Chang Yue'er was also Fairy Xi Xuan's personal disciple.Han Jue suspected they were relatives.He felt that Chang Yue'er's potential was only mediocre.\"No, you can go if you want to.\"Han Jue shook his head. Conflict would easily break out in a banquet with disciples from different peaks. Especially near the inner sect assessment, all of them would want their own peak to look good.\"Fine.\"Chang Yue'er shook her head and left.Han Jue continued practicing the Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal.Although he had already learned it, he wanted to gain complete mastery as he did with his sword techniques.After all, the remaining time wasn't enough to cultivate further.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comDays passed like that.And the inner sect assessment finally began.The thirteen disciples taking part in the assessment stood before the Jade Serene Hall. A wooden notice hanging on the hall gate displayed the venues and timings for each disciple.Everyone had to compete on the first day.Han Jue's first match was at Tian Zhu Peak.Tian Zhu Peak was among the top three in the sect. They were strong.The timing was noon on the second day.After taking note of it, Han Jue quickly returned to his cave abode.But he saw someone unexpected at the entrance.Xing Hongxuan!It had been decades. She looked even more elegant in the Jade Pure Sect Daoist robes.\"Husband!\"Xing Hongxuan called out in surprise and scurried over.Speechless, Han Jue moved back as he complained, \"Miss, I'm not, so don't call me that!\"Xing Hongxuan covered her mouth and laughed. \"Didn't we agree on this back in the outer sect?\"Helpless, Han Jue said frankly, \"I was just putting on a show. If I rejected you, you would have killed me.\"\"But I took it seriously. When I met the Sect Master, I was worried that you would have already exposed me. However, you didn't. You gave me the opportunity to confess. Only then did I have the opportunity to rejoin the Jade Pure Sect and obtain my current status.\"Xing Hongxuan smiled. She took out a jade bottle from her sleeve and said, \"This is a Jade Pure Pill. It's suitable for Foundation Establishment realm cultivators to increase their cultivation. I haven't reached the Foundation Establishment realm yet, so you can use it first.

If my husband reaches the Nascent Soul realm, he won't mistreat me, right?\"Her smile was very sweet and pure, without the slightest hint of a fiendish cultivator.Han Jue didn't know if he should reject.Xing Hongxuan suddenly turned around and left. She performed flying sword technique and disappeared into the clouds.She didn't give him a chance to reject!Updated from lightnovelworld.comWhen Han Jue returned to his cave abode, he opened the bottle and found seven Jade Pure Pills inside.Swallowed one, he was pleasantly surprised to find a huge amount of Spirit Qi entering his body. He hurriedly circulated his spirit power to refine it.An hour later.He had completed refining all the Spirit Qi into water spirit energy. It was as good as half a month of cultivation.With his aptitude, half a month of cultivation was equivalent to several years of cultivation for others.\"This pill is so powerful. Is this the treatment of a core candidate?\"Han Jue was secretly shocked.He had underestimated Xing Hongxuan's favorability towards him.At the same time, he was quite puzzled. So, she's able to receive such treatment only by providing information about Viridescent Nether Cult's operations in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm?Xing Hongxuan was only a Qi Refinement cultivator active in the outer sect previously. How did she find out the secrets of the Viridescent Nether Cult?It seemed that her identity wasn't as simple as he had imagined.Han Jue didn't think too much and continued to take the Jade Pure Pills.After three pills, his water cultivation potential had successfully reached the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm.He converted all the remaining Jade Pure Pills into earth spirit energy and successfully reached the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm for it too.At this point, all six types of cultivation potentials had reached the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm!He scanned outside with his divine sense and saw it was already late at night.\"What a powerful Jade Pure Pill.

It seems like he's very determined and confident in himself.\"Xing Hongxuan nodded.Thinking of Han Jue's extremely handsome face, her face turned slightly red.\"It seems I have to pay more attention to him,\" Daoist Jingxu said with a half-smile.\u2026At noon.Han Jue set off for Tian Zhu Peak.He stood on the flying sword with a conflicted expression.What should I do today?I can't seem too strong.With a ninth-level Foundation Establishment cultivation for all six attributes and unparalleled sword techniques, Han Jue really didn't think anyone could compete with him.He had heard that the highest cultivation level of this assessment's candidates was only at the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm.Disciples with higher cultivation levels had already finished their apprenticeship or become personal disciples, elite disciples, or core disciples. They didn't need the reward from the assessment.With the same cultivation, Han Jue felt that he couldn't lose.[Detected that the Jade Pure Sect inner sect assessment is about to begin.

It's probably related to my choice in the beginning.\"Han Jue thought silently.When he started the Game of Life, he chose to cultivate in a low-profile manner and even activated the ability to hide his cultivation.Pretty good.I like this!Playing the pig to eat the tiger!No!Remain low profile until I become invincible!Han Jue thought happily.He wanted to be the secret cultivation master of the Jade Pure Sect.Han Jue couldn't choose the second option directly. He had to wait till the end of the assessment.Elated, he accelerated towards Tian Zhu Peak.\u2026At Tian Zhu Peak.Dozens of disciples surrounded a battle arena. Mo Fuchou and Mo Zhu also came.As they watched the battle on the stage, Mo Fuchou and Mo Zhu were puzzled.Han Jue seemed to be in a stalemate with his opponent. Most of the time, he was defending and dodging, clearly at a disadvantage.His opponent, a disciple of Tian Zhu Peak, was excited.To meet such a weakling in the first round, this is too awesome!The Tian Zhu Peak disciple silently thought to himself. He exerted his spirit energy generously and even maintained a handsome posture during the battle.Han Jue was suffering.It was really tiring to act like this.He used the Seven Illusionary Steps to dodge, but he still had to try his best to show that his movement technique wasn't exquisite.He gritted his teeth and persisted.As the two of them fought for longer and longer, the spectating disciples felt bored and left one after another.Mo Fuchou and Mo Zhu were still watching the battle.\"He can't be so weak, can he?\" Mo Zhu couldn't help but ask.Mo Fuchou said calmly, \"He's doing it on purpose.\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceAt this moment\u2026Han Jue suddenly used the Unparalleled Finger Divine Sword. He pointed his finger and the sword Qi pierced his opponent's shoulder. Immediately, he launched forward with Seven Illusionary Steps and kicked the opponent down the sparring platform.It was over!The three deacons presiding over the battle were stunned.Their attention had already strayed away. They didn't expect it to end so abruptly.Han Jue cupped his fists and said, \"Thank you!\"He then walked towards the three deacons below the platform and registered his victory.The Tian Zhu Peak disciple left dejectedly.The Mo siblings immediately came forward.\"Brother Han, why didn't you win directly?\" Mo Fuchou asked.In his opinion, Han Jue was the most talented disciple of the Jade Pure Sect.However, Han Jue kept a low profile, and no one believed his talent.Han Jue shook his head and smiled. \"I only found his weakness.\"He then changed the topic. \"How have you been recently, Miss Mo?\"It would have been fine if he hadn't brought it up, but the moment he did, Mo Zhu was infuriated.\"If I knew earlier, I would have listened to you. I went to Li Qianlong's abode, and in the end, I was targeted by both fiendish cultivators and fellow disciples. Eventually, I was forced to jump off the cliff. I was fortunate to have an elder assist me.\"Mo Zhu cursed angrily.Han Jue asked, \"Who is this elder?\"\"I'm not sure, either. He left after saving me. Perhaps he's some expert from the Jade Pure Sect.\"\"Oh.\"That was the end of the conversation.Han Jue bid farewell to the siblings and left quickly.Mo Zhu looked at his departing figure and said gloomily, \"Big Brother, why do I feel like he's avoiding me? He doesn't want to talk to me.\"Mo Fuchou smiled and said, \"You're making it too obvious. Brother Han is an ascetic. He doesn't want his cultivation to be affected by love.\"\"What's left to life if he always cultivates like that?\"\"Everyone pursues different things. He pursues immortality and the Great Dao.\"\"I think the two of you are the same kind of people.\"\"I'm no match for him.\"\u2026Han Jue continued practicing the Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal once he had returned to his cave abode.He only used Seven Illusionary Steps in the match a while ago, so he was hardly tired.Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comIn the following days, the same pattern followed.Every time, Han Jue would only defeat his opponent after all the spectators had left. The defeated opponents would be too embarrassed to mention it. Hence, Han Jue continued progressing, but no one took much notice.But the reincarnated Mahayana realm cultivator Zhou Fan was the black horse. He continued winning until he reached the top ten.The entire inner sect was discussing him.Many thought he was daydreaming to want to challenge the First Disciple of the Sword Peak for a companion. They didn't think he could do much.The First Disciple of the Sword Peak didn't participate in the assessment, but he had announced that if Zhou Fan managed to enter the top three, he would accept the challenge.This matter caused an uproar in the inner sect, but Han Jue wasn't interested.He had read too many such plots in novels.That night.Han Jue was cultivating the Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal in the cave abode.He hadn't used this move in the previous battles. But as he practiced for the past few days, he could handle the Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal pretty well now.Han Jue could cast this spell within a second.Most spells required hand seals to activate the technique. They weren't like purely physical techniques that had no delay.But with more practice, a day would come when the spell could be cast immediately.Whoosh\u2014The sound of wind came from outside the cave abode. At first, Han Jue didn't care.But not long after, he felt inexplicably uneasy.He quickly stopped and scanned the surroundings with his divine sense.There was no one in the open space outside the cave, nor were there any beasts or birds.Under the crescent moon, Jade Serene Peak actually looked very sinister.\"What's happening?\"Han Jue frowned.The trees outside weren't moving, which meant there was no wind. But why could he still hear the wind?Was he possessed?Han Jue felt a chill down his spine.After being reborn for decades, this was the first time he encountered such a situation.But if this world had demons and cultivators, ghosts weren't too far-fetched either!Nervous, Han Jue held his breath.If it was really a ghost, how strong would it be if even Fairy Xi Xuan didn't discover it?Ghosts, ghosts, please leave\u2026 Ghosts, ghosts, please leave\u2026He chanted to himself.For more, visit lightnovelworld.comAt this moment\u2026All of a sudden, he saw wisps of black aura flying into the cave through the crack in the stone gate.What the hell!It really is a ghost!Without another word, Han Jue raised his hand and executed the Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal.A golden jade seal flew head-on towards the black aura. This golden jade seal was embedded with nine dragons, domineeringly and divine. It directly dispersed the black gas and disappeared into thin air.Han Jue frowned.He felt a powerful repulsive force.Logically speaking, the Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal should have continued to crash forward, knocking down the stone door.He focused his gaze and saw that the scattered black aura was condensing again.Han Jue quickly went up and used the Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal again.Boom\u2014Not enough. Again!Boom\u2014Boom\u2014Han Jue stood in front of the black aura and struck out with his palms, again and again, creating a huge hole in the ground. The wall of the cave beside him also split open.This was still under his precise control. Otherwise, he could have collapsed the entire cave abode with a single palm strike.\"Wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!\"A wail followed.Han Jue frowned and looked down at the black aura.\"I'm a Great Grand Elder of the Jade Pure Sect. How dare a disciple like you disrespect me!\"The black aura roared angrily, leaving Han Jue stunned.Great Grand Elder?The black aura quickly condensed into a human form. It was very short, only half a meter tall.This person was emaciated and wore a large white robe. With a head full of white hair, he looked up at him angrily.Han Jue said helplessly, \"Sir, what are you trying to do by sneaking into my cave abode in the middle of the night?\"The Great Grand Elder said grumpily, \"I'm just cultivating a divine art. My primordial spirit has left my body. When I heard the sound coming from your cave abode, I couldn't help but come in out of curiosity.\"Although he lectured him, he was actually shocked inside.What kind of spell was that?He almost killed me!His spirit energy felt like the fifth level of the Golden Core Realm!For more, visit lightnovelworld.comThe Jade Pure Sect's inner sect is already so outstanding?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What you're doing can really scare disciples like me to death.\"Han Jue shook his head. He was really speechless.Cultivating divine arts in the middle of the night, acting mysterious!Just now, he really should have directly killed this Great Grand Elder's Essence Soul.\"Don't, don't, don't! I was just playing around for a moment. I apologize to you. I'm sorry!\" The Great Grand Elder hurriedly said.Amused, Han Jue asked, \"You know my master?\"\"Cough, cough. Actually, your master is my disciple, so is the current Sect Master.\"The Great Grand Elder held his head high proudly.However, Han Jue remained expressionless.The Great Grand Elder's smile immediately faded.Does he not believe me?Han Jue said, \"Then, I'll pretend that nothing happened tonight. You can leave.\"\"Really?\"\"No worries.\"The Great Grand Elder immediately turned around and left.He had just taken a few steps when he suddenly turned around and asked, \"Boy, I see that you're very talented. Do you want to inherit my legacy?\"Han Jue raised his eyebrows and asked, \"What legacy?\"\"I'll impart to you an unparalleled cultivation technique, the Heavenly Constellation Golden Body. Do you want it? In the entire Jade Pure Sect, only the Sect Master and I know it!\"Heavenly Constellation Golden Body?Sounds impressive!Han Jue's eyes lit up.But on second thought, he hesitated. It wasn't even a pleasant encounter. Why would this old man teach him a cultivation technique?It must be a trap!Trying to trick me?Han Jue shook his head and said, \"Never mind. Thank you for your kindness, Sir.\"The Great Grand Elder's smile froze again. With a cold snort, he swung his sleeves and left.An hour later.Han Jue left the cave abode and flew towards Jade Serene Hall.He stopped in front of the front gate and knelt.As the gate burst open, Han Jue quickly walked in.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.com\"Why are you here so late at night?\" Fairy Xi Xuan asked with her eyes closed.Han Jue knelt in front of her and told her everything that happened.Fairy Xi Xuan opened her eyes and frowned.She was displeased.This damned old man is restless again!\"You almost killed him?\" Fairy Xi Xuan asked curiously.Han Jue scratched his head and said, \"Was cultivating a divine art, so I can only block it. That's not important. Master, will he come and harass me again? I don't want to be afraid every night.\"\"Don't worry. I'll go find him tomorrow. If he dares to come again, I'll deal with him myself.\"\"Thank you, Master.\"\"No worries.\"Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief. He could finally relax now.Before he left, he asked curiously, \"Master, is the Heavenly Constellation Golden Body powerful? He wanted to teach me this cultivation technique.\"\"Yes. It can be said to be the strongest cultivation technique of the Jade Pure Sect. It's even more powerful than Jade Pure Technique. However, before cultivating it, one needs to cut off one's roots.\"\"What root?\"\"The thing that makes you a man.\"\"\u2026\"Han Jue wanted to curse.I knew it!That old man was up to no good!Wait!Does this mean\u2026The Great Grand Elder and Sect Leader have already\u2026Han Jue discovered a shocking fact and felt his worldview shattered.\"This matter cannot be spread,\" Fairy Xi Xuan said solemnly.\"I understand.\"Han Jue bowed and left.\u2026After returning to his cave abode, Han Jue was still thinking about the Heavenly Constellation Golden Body.No wonder even though Li Qingzi liked Fairy Xi Xuan, the two of them did not become companions.\"They're even more extreme than me. They both stay away from women by cutting their own\u2026\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experienceHan Jue was impressed. At the same time, he labeled the Great Grand Elder as untrustworthy.The next morning.Han Jue headed towards the inner sect city.The battle of the top ten in the inner sect assessment would officially begin at noon.The Inner Sect Assessment was different from the Inner Sect Competition. The Inner Sect Assessment was a way to become an elite disciple, and one could register freely. The Inner Sect Competition was a competition between the eighteen peaks, and the ranking was a motivation for each peak to work hard.The battle arena had already been built, located in the square in the center of the city, three hundred meters long and wide. There was already a huge crowd around it. Many disciples were flying on their swords and floating in the air. It was a very spectacular sight.\"Junior, you're finally here!\"Excited, Chang Yue'er immediately ran over.More than ten disciples from Jade Serene Peak gathered around to cheer him on.Han Jue frowned when he saw so many people.With so many people around, how am I supposed to act?Should I be more straightforward?Defeat them immediately?Han Jue hesitated.Suddenly feeling a gaze settle on him, he turned around and saw Zhou Fan staring at him with a burning gaze, full of fighting spirit.Han Jue was baffled.When did I provoke him?Zhou Fan recalled Mo Fuchou's words that in this inner sect assessment, his greatest opponent was Han Jue.Mo Fuchou said that Han Jue had always been hiding his strength and was not inferior to elite disciples.Because of this, Zhou Fan had always treated Han Jue as an imaginary enemy.He didn't understand Han Jue.With outstanding aptitude and stunning looks, why did he keep such a low profile?He heard that Mo Zhu had taken a liking to him, but Han Jue had been avoiding her.The more Han Jue kept a low profile, the more Zhou Fan felt sore.However, I already have a powerful trump card. He's definitely not my match! Zhou Fan thought firmly.At this moment.Mo Zhu suddenly appeared before Han Jue and said excitedly, \"Brother Han, I believe you will definitely take first place.\"Chang Yue'er asked warily, \"Who are you?\"Mo Zhu looked back at her. They were obviously unhappy with each other.Han Jue saw that their conflict was about to erupt and felt that something was wrong.New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.com\"Husband!\"Hearing a burst of laughter, Han Jue turned around and saw Xing Hongxuan.Chang Yue'er and Mo Zhu both turned to look.Crap!It's Mars crashed into Earth!Han Jue immediately turned and left. He had to leave the dangerous situation.However, the three women didn't follow him. Instead, they walked together and began to oppose each other.The surrounding disciples were envious of Han Jue.Being good-looking makes him truly fearless!With so many beautiful juniors admiring him, he doesn't even care!This is a crime!\u2026At noon.The inner disciples' assessment officially began.The person presiding over the assessment this time was the Heavenly Thunder Peak's Old Immortal Daoist Thunder.The elders of the other seventeen peaks did not come. The spectators were ordinary elders, deacons, hall masters, and so on. More than two thousand inner sect disciples and mortal slaves came to watch the battles.Although there weren't many inner sect disciples, there were many mortal slaves in the inner sect city.Han Jue was participating in the very first match.When his name was called, he immediately went on stage.\"Han Jue of the Jade Serene Peak versus Zhou Fan of the Heavenly Thunder Peak!\"Whoosh\u2014The moment Zhou Fan's name was announced, the audience erupted.Recently, Zhou Fan was the most famous disciple in the inner sect. He could be said to be the biggest black horse. Rumors had it that he had a trump card that could defeat anyone instantly. He was undefeated in every battle and totally unstoppable.Zhou Fan cupped his fists and smiled. \"Brother Han, you must do your best this time.\"Han Jue asked expressionlessly, \"Really?\"\"Really!\"Zhou Fan raised his right hand, and a small black bell appeared in his palm. It was eerie and mysterious.In a nearby pavilion, the elders and deacons all frowned.They had long heard that Zhou Fan had a powerful secret weapon, a Dharma treasure. It was a Birth Dharma treasure.What was a Birth Dharma treasure?For more, visit lightnovelworld.comOne that would be created at the birth of its owner. They were the legacy of his ancestors.

That was the only way to minimize the impact.If Han Jue defeated him when Zhou Fan released all his power, it would only show that Han Jue was even stronger. In that way, he wouldn't be able to keep a low profile anymore.With so many people watching, it was impossible for Han Li to delay until everyone left.After his decision, Han Jue walked towards Zhou Fan.Mo Zhu said with a solemn expression, \"Zhou Fan's birth Dharma treasure is very strong. Because of this treasure, Master made an exception and took him in as a personal disciple.\"Chang Yue'er disdainfully said, \"He's no match for Junior Han.\"Xing Hongxuan didn't say anything. Her beautiful eyes were fixed on Han Jue.Zhou Fan had a confident smile on his face, but seeing Han Jue walking straight towards him, he still felt inexplicably flustered.Because he had often heard Mo Fuchou brag about him!Slowly, he felt that Han Jue was very strong.Today, I will defeat him and prove my strength!Watch carefully. I'll make you regret it and let you know that you've underestimated me!Zhou Fan thought about it silently. When he thought about that smiling handsome face, he was furious.He raised the small black bell, preparing to display his power!A crazed smile appeared on his face.So what if he's gifted!Today, I, Zhou Fan, will defeat this gifted cultivator!Swish!A blinding sword flashed, causing Zhou Fan to subconsciously close his eyes.Boom\u2014Zhou Fan was sent flying, vomiting blood. He was like a kite with a broken string, blown out of the battle arena.Silence!Everyone was silent.Everyone was stunned. They had yet to recover from their shock.The battle ended so quickly?Even Old Immortal Dao Thunder, who was overseeing the Inner Sect Assessment, widened his eyes.Han Jue retracted his technique, and the sword shadow behind him quickly disappeared. It only appeared for less than two seconds.Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.He turned and bowed to Old Immortal Dao Thunder with cupped fists.Old Immortal Dao Thunder came back to his senses and announced, \"Jade Serene Peak's Han Jue wins!\"Boom\u2014The crowd burst into excitement. The male disciples discussed and the female disciples stared at him with glowing eyes.\"So fast?\"\"See, Zhou Fan is just mediocre!\"\"Han Jue is too strong!\"\"Who is Han Jue? When did such a genius appear in Jade Serene Peak?\"\"He's so handsome. Could he be the one the female disciples often discuss?\"\u2026Han Jue quickly left the stage and disappeared into the crowd.Since the battle arena wasn't destroyed, the second battle soon began.Zhou Fan was helped out of the crowd by a group of Heavenly Thunder Peak disciples.There was still blood at the corner of his mouth. His face was pale and his eyes were lifeless. He seemed to have lost his soul.The blow was too great.He didn't even know how he lost.But the moment he was hit by the Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique, he sensed imminent death.He knew that Han Jue could have killed him.One moment, he was still full of confidence.The next moment, he was off the platform.Zhou Fan wished he could dig a hole to hide.He knew he had become a joke.Chang Yue'er, Xing Hongxuan, and Mo Zhu tried to look for Han Jue but couldn't find him.He hid amidst the crowd and watched silently.Two hours later.The top five were decided.The five disciples would draw lots to decide who would skip the next round and head straight to the top three.The disciples didn't have any objections. At this stage, the difference in strength wasn't great. Everyone could be in the top three.Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experienceLuck was an indispensable thing on the path of cultivation.Han Jue hesitated. If he became one of the top three, maybe he could just give up straight away.In any case, the top three could choose the Connate Cave Abode\u2026That's it!This way, his influence would be minimized.He prayed silently.\"Han Jue of the Jade Serene Peak is going to the top three straight away!\"The other four disciples looked at him with envy and vigilance as Old Immortal Daoist Thunder made the announcement.They had all witnessed Han Jue defeating Zhou Fan in a flash. This fellow didn't use much of his spirit energy and was still in his peak state.Han Jue was overwhelmed with joy as he quietly walked off the stage.Chang Yue'er and the other two immediately surrounded him, preventing him from escaping.\"Junior, you have a good chance of getting first place this time!\" Chang Yue'er said excitedly.Mo Zhu and Xing Hongxuan were also very excited.They all admired Han Jue and naturally hoped to see him in the limelight.Han Jue shook his head and said, \"I can't. It's already not easy to come this far.\"Zhou Fan, who was making his way over, almost fainted when he heard that.He still wanted to ask Han Jue what kind of spell he had used to defeat him, but he ended up hearing such words.Zhou Fan was so angry that he spat out blood. The disciple in front of him was sprayed full of blood.Zhou Fan quickly turned and left.Han Jue turned around to see, but Zhou Fan was already gone.The next two matches were intense. Equipment, magic, movement techniques, and talismans. All sorts of things appeared. The four disciples were all-rounded and on par with each other. No matter who was the final winner, they still put on a good fight.The top three were finally on stage.\"The three of you will each fight two more rounds with different opponents. The one who wins twice will be the first, a win and a defeat will be the second, and losing twice will be the third.\" Old Immortal Daoist Thunder explained the rules.Han Jue suddenly raised his hand and said, \"Elder, I admit defeat. Previously, in order to quickly defeat my opponent, I exhausted all of my spiritual energy and have yet to recover. Let the two of them fight it out.

Chang Yue'er and the other two girls also widened their eyes.Zhou Fan was stunned when he heard that.Really?Updated from lightnovelworld.comIf that wasn't the case, why would Han Jue admit defeat?So I'm not that weak.[Zhou Fan's favorability towards you has increased. Current favorability: 2 stars]When Han Jue saw the words in front of him, he said in his head, This guy is nuts!Old Immortal Daoist Thunder stared at him and then nodded. He changed the rules, and Han Jue was ranked third.Han Jue immediately got off the stage.The following fight was less exciting than the previous ones. Both of them had consumed a lot of spiritual energy.Han Jue felt that he could have taken on both of them together.In the end, the top three were decided, and the Inner Sect Assessment ended.The top three followed Old Immortal Daoist Thunder to Main Peak.On his way there flying on his sword, a line appeared before Han Jue:[You entered the top three in the Inner Sect Assessment while keeping a low profile.

Could there be sixth-grade, fifth-grade, and up to first-grade Numinous Treasures?How powerful would a first-grade Numinous treasure be?Han Jue guessed silently.He was in a good mood.This was too satisfying. After obtaining the Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe, he felt very safe. And he was going to get a connate cave abode. It was a very fruitful inner sect assessment.Once he wore the Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe, he would be able to cultivate in peace and wouldn't have to worry about sneak attacks.Soul Formation realm cultivators were few in number. Hardly one appeared every century in the Jade Pure Sect.However, the Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe could only protect him. If he ran into a Nascent Soul cultivator, they wouldn't be able to kill him, and neither would he be able to kill them.Han Jue couldn't help but smile.\"Why are you so happy to be in third place?

Master never told me to stop at the top three. I haven't been in Jade Serene Peak for long. Although I became her personal disciple, Master said that as long as I do my best, it's fine.\"Old Immortal Daoist Thunder snorted in obvious disbelief.Zhou Fan was his personal disciple, and Han Jue admitted defeat right after beating him. Han Jue was obviously not giving Heavenly Thunder Peak face. But as an Elder, Old Immortal Daoist Thunder couldn't lash out at him.Han Jue smiled politely at the other two disciples.The three of them didn't talk much, and it wasn't suitable for them to talk at the moment.Before long\u2026They arrived at Main Peak.Old Immortal Daoist Thunder introduced them to Daoist Jingxu and left.\"The top three participants of the inner court assessment this time will be promoted to elite disciples. Besides that, all of you can choose a Connate Cave Abode. The first place will get to choose first,\" Daoist Jingxu said expressionlessly as she inconspicuously glanced at Han Jue.This kid actually managed to reach the top three.Looks like Xuan'er wasn't mistaken.He's indeed talented.The two disciples weren't surprised. Clearly, they already knew about the Connate Cave Abode beforehand.Daoist Jingxu waved her right hand, and the images of three Connate Cave Abodes appeared.The three abodes surrounded the edge of a mountain range. Han Jue took a glance and guessed that it was a map of the Jade Pure Sect.Are they making us security guards?Han Jue ridiculed in his head. The three cave abodes nicely surrounded the eighteen peaks.Nevertheless, a Connate Cave Abode was too attractive. It was like a free spiritual pool. It was still acceptable.Now that he had the Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe, he wasn't afraid of any danger anyway.Daoist Jingxu began to introduce the three cave abodes.The first was rich with fire and wind Spirit Qi,The second was relatively abundant with water, fire, and wood Spirit Qi.The last had Spirit Qi of all attributes, but each only as rich as in a usual spiritual pool.There were no surprises.Han Jue was left with the last cave abode.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comCultivators who could reach this stage were all geniuses with three or four cultivation potentials. However, they usually only cultivated a single attribute, so they would choose the first two Connate Cave Abodes.Han Jue couldn't choose but still ended up with the one that suited him the most.After choosing the cave abode, Han Jue was given a talisman.Tearing the talisman would lead them to their Connate Cave Abodes.The three of them bowed and left.After walking out of the hall, Han Jue immediately tore the talisman. A golden pigeon appeared out of thin air and flew into the distance. Han Jue immediately followed it.The other two bid farewell and also parted.\u2026After flying after the golden pigeon for half an hour, Han Jue finally found the Connate Cave Abode.It was located in a forest. The golden pigeon flew head-on into the cliff wall, inducing a glow in the wall. Feeling the fluctuations of Spirit Qi, there was probably a formation in front.A hole appeared on the cliff wall, and Han Jue immediately walked in.The tunnel was wide enough for four people to walk side by side. After walking for fifty steps, he saw the cave abode. It was huge, and the walls were damp. There was a hole at the top of the cave where cold air flowed in. In the middle of the cave, there was a pool with many water plants. The water was warm, and vapor could be seen above the surface.Han Jue felt that the dense Spirit Qi might be slightly more concentrated than the spiritual pools.And it contained all six attributes!Han Jue was satisfied.He first took out the Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe and wore it before putting on the Jade Pure Sect's Daoist robe over it.The moment Han Jue put on the Numinous Treasure, he felt his entire aura change.He felt so safe!Han Jue smiled happily as he walked back to the cave entrance.He looked up.This was his exclusive cave now. He had to give it a name!He used his finger as a sword to carve words above the cave entrance.\"Endure Today, Freedom Tomorrow!\"Han Jue nodded in satisfaction. It was a good piece of calligraphy. The strokes demonstrated his power and the strength of his sword Qi.After carving the line, Han Jue chopped the trees nearby and then made a table, chairs, and a bed.Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.\u2026At Jade Serene Hall.Fairy Xi Xuan was expressionless.Chang Yue'er recounted what had happened in the inner sect assessment.When she heard that Han Jue admitted defeat after entering the top three, the corner of her mouth twitched.This kid\u2026So unambitious!Fairy Xi Xuan admired Han Jue's heart towards the Dao, but she couldn't understand why he was so afraid of being in the limelight.He's ridiculously cowardly!Most importantly, Han Jue's appearance was extremely outstanding. It was hard for him not to stand out.\"Master, did Junior Han suffer persecution when he was young?\" Chang Yue'er asked.Fairy Xi Xuan was deep in thought.It looked like she had to ask Elder Iron.Can it be that Elder Iron tortured Han Jue before?Thinking of this, Fairy Xi Xuan's glare turned cold.She had never liked Elder Iron. If it weren't for his meritorious service in the outer sect, no one would be willing to accept him into the inner sect even if he reached the Foundation Establishment realm. Elder Iron had hardly any potential.\u2026After the inner sect assessment ended, Han Jue didn't attract much attention. The disciples would only smile when others mentioned him.Han Jue also didn't go to the inner sect city and stayed in the Connate Cave to cultivate.He was prepared to enter the Golden Core realm as soon as possible!All his Spirit Qi had already reached the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm. As long as he cultivated them to perfection, he would be able to reach the Golden Core realm.Han Jue was full of fighting spirit.Once he reached the Golden Core realm, he would be able to use the Six Paths of Reincarnation's divine powers.The Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique had its own divine art, but it required one to reach a certain realm.

Who knows when a full-scale war will break out one day. We would like to invite you to go on a mission together and take down one of the Cult's branches. Apparently, they possess many pills that can help you cultivate.\"Before coming, Mo Fuchou had thought about it.If he wanted to convince Han Jue, he had to talk about cultivation.Han Jue shook his head and said, \"Thank you for your kind intentions. I don't want to leave for the time being. I have to enter seclusion to break through.\"Breakthrough in seclusion?Both of them were stunned.Zhou Fan couldn't help but ask, \"You want to enter the Golden Core realm?\"Han Jue nodded.\"It's not that easy to break through to the Golden Core realm. The heavenly tribulation you will face is even more terrifying than the one at the Foundation Establishment realm. You have to rely on some Tribulation Transcendence Pills to neutralize the power of the heavenly lightning and consolidate your Dao heart,\" Mo Fuchou reminded.Zhou Fan added, \"This mission is very important. If we perform well, we will definitely succeed. Our status in the Jade Pure Sect will also rise in the future, and we will be able to make a name for ourselves in the cultivation world.\"[You have received an invitation from a fellow disciple.

Frankly, he wanted to say that Han Jue was afraid of death.He had heard from other disciples of Jade Serene Peak that Han Jue was good at everything, but he was too timid.Mo Fuchou didn't speak for Han Jue this time. He sighed and said, \"One can't only cultivate in seclusion. We're mortals. We still have to fight for opportunities. Just wait and see, he will come to his senses sooner or later.\"Zhou Fan nodded.He suddenly looked forward to this mission.Once he obtained those elixirs, he might be able to surpass Han Jue!Thinking of this, Zhou Fan was very excited.Previously, he had been knocked out by Han Jue in the inner sect assessment. It was really traumatic. Although he didn't hate him, he had always wanted to regain his honor.\u2026[Congratulations on obtaining a Little Universe Belt][Little Universe Belt: It contains a large alternate space. It can be used as a storage ring or storage bag. The belt is elastic and not easily destroyed.]Han Jue raised his eyebrows and looked at the Little Universe Belt in his hand.The belt was like a scroll of painting, but a very narrow one. He used his divine sense to probe it. There was an alternate space of a thousand cubic meters within. It was much bigger than his storage bag.He immediately dripped his blood on it to claim the belt.After he succeeded, he threw everything into the Little Universe Belt and tied it around his waist.The belt tightened around his robe. It wasn't too tight nor too loose around his waist. Very comfortable.Han Jue played with it for a while before resuming cultivation.\u2026Two years passed in a flash.His six spiritual powers had all reached perfection.He was preparing to transcend the tribulation!He activated the barrier function and underwent his tribulation in the cave abode.Although the Heavenly Tribulation of the Golden Core realm was formidable, it was far from being able to destroy the mountain. The Heavenly Thunder would be concentrated above his head.Apparently, the Golden Core realm's heavenly tribulations would provoke his inner evil.Only around three in ten Foundation Establishment realm cultivators could break through to the Golden Core realm.They would either be struck to death by the Heavenly Tribulation or be driven mad from the inner evil.Han Jue had a top-notch cultivation potential and practiced top techniques. He wasn't afraid of these obstacles.As he activated his cultivation method, dark clouds started to gather above him. Lightning began flashing.Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceAt the same time, a voice sounded in Han Jue's mind.\"What do you want?\"\"Fame?\"\"Money?\"\"Women?\"\"You're already strong enough.

However, he was able to fend off the excess with other spirit energy. He didn't feel a thing.He soon noticed that it wasn't his spirit energy that was doing the job, but the Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe's effect.This Numinous Treasure can actually help me transcend the tribulation\u2026Han Jue thought in surprise.The Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe was able to withstand an attack from a Soul Formation realm cultivator. Would it also be able to help him transcend to the Nascent Soul realm in the future?Han Jue got excited.What a treasure!Motivated, Han Jue continued his tribulation.\u2026Seven days later.Han Jue finally succeeded.[Congratulations on breaking through to the Golden Core realm and obtaining an unparalleled magical sword.][Congratulations on obtaining the Qilin Sword.][Qilin Sword: A sword made from the bones of a Qilin.

The eighteen peaks were too eye-catching.Han Jue checked his interpersonal relationships as he flew on his sword.The Favorability and Hatred didn't change much.He opened the mailbox.[Your good friend Li Qingzi was attacked by a fiendish cultivator.][Your good friend Li Qingzi was attacked by a fiendish cultivator.]\u2026Omit ten similar messages.\u2026[Your good friend Li Qingzi was attacked by a fiendish cultivator and was severely injured.

Aren't you afraid of death?\"\"Death is unavoidable. When the time comes, one either has an impactful or a mediocre life. Even though I pursue longevity, I won't abandon you, Master.\"\"I've never taught you anything.\"\"Yes, but your kindness and care are invaluable. You've helped me compete for opportunities and settle potential troubles.

It seemed like there was no Nascent Soul realm cultivator among them.If that was the case, Han Jue was more confident about his safety.A Nascent Soul realm cultivator couldn't kill him.\"Are there any problems with your cultivation recently?\" Fairy Xi Xuan asked with gentle eyes.Speaking of which, she hadn't really taught this disciple yet.Han Jue shook his head and said, \"No, there's no need to trouble you, Master.\"If he cultivated with Fairy Xi Xuan, wouldn't he be exposing his Golden Core realm cultivation?If the sect elders heard about it, they might drag him over to labor.When Fairy Xi Xuan heard this, she immediately snorted. \"Then get lost!\"\"Yes, Master!\"Han Jue left.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comHe had just left the hall when Fairy Xi Xuan took out a storage bag and handed it to Chang Yue'er. \"Help your junior according to what I said.\"Chang Yue'er nodded and stood up excitedly.\u2026As soon as Han Jue flew out of the Jade Serene Peak, he heard a whistling sound behind him. He turned around and saw Chang Yue'er chasing after him on her sword.\"Junior Han, wait for me!\"Chang Yue'er waved her hand and shouted with a happy smile on her face.Han Jue frowned and stopped.Chang Yue'er stopped at his side and waved the storage bag in her hand, saying, \"There's a set formation and some spirit herb seeds inside. Master asked me to help you set up the formation and plant spirit herbs to increase the Spirit Qi in your cave abode.\"When Han Jue heard this, his brows immediately relaxed. He cupped his fists and said, \"Thanks to our Master. Thank you, Senior.\"Chang Yue'er smiled even more happily.The two of them continued flying towards the Connate Cave Abode.Arriving at the entrance of the cave abode, Chang Yue'er saw the words on the stone door. With a strange expression, she muttered, \"Endure today, freedom tomorrow\u2026 this name\u2026\"Han Jue entered the cave expressionlessly.Chang Yue'er followed closely behind. She stopped at the edge of the tunnel and took out the equipment for the formation and began setting it up.Han Jue turned around and stood behind her, observing closely.Learning how to set up formations was also beneficial for the future.Chang Yue'er noticed that he was behind her and couldn't help but become more serious.After nearly two hours, she finally finished setting up the array formation. The switch was embedded into the wall of the cave. It was a piece of jade stone that could be activated by pouring spirit energy into it.This array formation could conceal the cave's entrance. If one were to forcibly enter it, they would be trapped in an illusion and become unable to extricate themselves.Han Jue sighed. \"I didn't expect you to know array formations.\"Chang Yue'er smiled proudly and said, \"What do you think I'm learning from Master all the time? Although my cultivation level is inferior to yours, I know alchemy, talisman crafting, array formations, exorcism, and so on!\"He had a whole new level of respect for her.Chang Yue'er turned around and walked into the cave abode. After sizing it up, she walked to the pool's side and began planting spirit herbs.\"If I become an immortal one day, I will let you be my herbalist.

How about that?\" Chang Yue'er covered her mouth and asked, even winking at him.Vigilant, Han Jue asked, \"You want to take advantage of my cave abode?\"Chang Yue'er rolled her eyes at him and turned to leave angrily.After she left the cave abode, Han Jue let out a long sigh.He patted his chest and muttered, \"Oh, Han Jue, it's really difficult to protect your body!\"Han Jue walked to the cave's entrance. After activating the formation, he returned to the wooden bed and started cultivating.The first level of the Golden Core Realm couldn't satisfy him!After mastering the third level of the Six Paths of Reincarnation Art, his Qi absorption speed was much faster than before. Coupled with the rich Spirit Qi in the Connate Cave Abode, he cultivated very happily.\u2026Five years passed in a flash.Han Jue's Thunder Cultivation Potential had reached the third level of the Golden Core Realm, while the other cultivation potentials had yet to be cultivated.He planned to cultivate his Thunder Cultivation Potential to the ninth level of the Golden Core Realm before cultivating his other cultivation potentials. After all, the Cult could attack at any time.His lifespan had also increased slightly. There were many ways to increase his lifespan on the path of cultivation, such as pills, natural treasures, and cultivation techniques.Han Jue's lifespan was only his most basic lifespan. If his cultivation couldn't break through, he could use other methods to increase it.In these five years, the Jade Pure Sect was safe.However, Sect Master Li Qingzi was often pursued by fiendish cultivators and was always heavily injured.Mo Fuchou and Zhou Fan were also frequently attacked by fiendish cultivators. It seemed like their adventures were truly fascinating.Every time he saw the messages of them being attacked by fiendish cultivators, Han Jue felt lucky he didn't follow them.Han Jue was still cultivating when a line of words appeared before his eyes.[Detected bearer of connate providence, check its origin.]The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is there someone outside the cave?He quickly checked its origin.[Chen Santian is inherently fiendish. He possesses an extremely strong affinity towards the Fiendish Dao's techniques. When he was young, he wandered along with his parents. When his parents were killed by bandits his fiendish character was awakened. He, who was only seven years old, slaughtered over 100 bandits. From then on, his killing became unstoppable. Eventually, he joined the Viridescent Nether Cult and became very successful. Presently, he's ranked as the eldest core disciple of the Viridescent Nether Cult.]As expected, someone from the Viridescent Nether Cult!Core disciple\u2026So, he hasn't reached the level of an elder yet!Han Jue understood that the strength of the Cult and Jade Pure Sect was about the same.Chen Santian was at most at the ninth level of the Golden Core Realm!\"Why is he here at the Jade Pure Sect? Is he alone, or is there a large group hidden around him?\"Han Jue got up and carefully walked to the cave entrance.He looked out and saw a man in black walking out of the woods nearby. He was acting suspiciously.Han Jue couldn't feel the man's presence.If he hadn't witnessed it with his own eyes, he might not have discovered him.Other than Chen Santian, there was no one else.As Chen Santian walked to the entrance of the cave, his gaze fell on a line of words on the mountain wall.\"Endure today, freedom tomorrow\u2026 How laughable. The people of the Jade Pure Sect are indeed cowards!\"Chen Santian couldn't help but sneer. In the tunnel, Han Jue felt offended.He's asking to be killed!Han Jue activated the Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique. Three sword shadows floated behind him, ready to kill Chen Santian at any time.Because of the array formation, Chen Santian couldn't see Han Jue and couldn't sense his aura.The two were less than ten steps apart.Chen Santian looked for a while and felt that something was off.\"Could this be a cave abode?\"Chen Santian narrowed his eyes. He took out a sword and gently stabbed it into the mountain wall.Swish! Swish! Swish!The sword light flashed, and Chen Santian subconsciously closed his eyes. He instinctively jumped back.Three sword shadows pierced through his body like lightning, and blood splattered everywhere.Chen Santian landed a dozen meters away like a sandbag. He crashed into a big tree, and the leaves fell like rain.Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experience\"Ouch\u2026\"Chen Santian gritted his teeth and looked up. Three sword shadows were floating above his head, ready to slash down at any moment. He was scared out of his wits.What's this?He hurriedly shouted, \"Sir, stop!\"Standing by the cave entrance, Han Jue shook his head.So weak?He can't withstand a single blow!Or is my Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique too powerful?Han Jue touched his chin and pondered.After being attacked by the Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique, the aura of Chen Santian's spirit energy was revealed.Han Jue made a comparison. Chen Santian's spirit energy was about the same level as his.However, he couldn't see through Chen Santian's cultivation level.In other words, Chen Santian's cultivation level was higher than his, but the strength of his spirit energy was not as strong as his.Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique's dominance was finally revealed.In a good mood, Han Jue asked, \"Why did you come to the Jade Pure Sect?\"Chen Santian replied, \"I happened to pass by this place. I didn't want to enter the Jade Pure Sect.\"He's really good at lying!The three sword shadows dropped down.Horrified, Chen Santian quickly jumped to the side. But his right leg was still pierced by the sword shadows and was nailed to the ground. He fell down like a dog pouncing on shit.\"Damn it\u2026\"Chen Santian was so aggrieved that he was about to explode.He was the core disciple of the Cult, yet he was subdued before he could even make a move.The three sword shadows were like ghosts. Their speed was ridiculously fast. Nailed to his legs, they were actually draining his spirit energy.What kind of spell is this?Chen Santian panicked.He had investigated the Jade Pure Sect. The sect wasn't a pure sword cultivation sect. Among the elders, no one had such a powerful sword-related spell.Could it be the mysterious Great Grand Elder?\"Chen Santian, Inherent Fiend, the Eldest Disciple of the Viridescent Nether Cult. What do you think will happen to you if I hand you over to the Jade Pure Sect?\" Han Jue's voice sounded again.Chen Santian's expression changed drastically. His heart was in turmoil.Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceHow does this guy know my background?Completely flustered, Chen Santian hurriedly kowtowed towards the direction of the cave abode and said fearfully, \"Sir! I was wrong! I was wrong! Give me a chance! I've never killed a disciple of the Jade Pure Sect!\"Han Jue was hesitating whether he should kill Chen Santian.Based on his experience from reading novels, killing such a prodigy might lead to a series of alternative storylines.Generally speaking, there would always be mechanisms with which his elders would know if such a prodigy was killed. Then, the protagonist would be pursued by them.Kill the little ones, come the big ones. Kill the big ones, come the old ones. Kill the old ones, come the older and bigger ones from the heavens.\"Why don't I capture him? If Sect Master is captured in the future, we can use him in the exchange, right?\" Han Jue thought silently.Sounds feasible!In any case, he was wearing the Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe. It was impossible for Chen Santian to hurt him.Han Jue waved his right hand, and the three sword shadows disappeared into thin air.Chen Santian didn't dare to escape. He could only kneel on the ground and shiver.He was already injured. With Han Jue's strength, even if he tried his best to escape, he wouldn't be able to.\"Come in.\"Han Jue's voice floated over.The cave entrance appeared, and the stone door opened.Chen Santian saw Han Jue.What a handsome man!So young!He thought Han Jue was the disciple of that elder. He gritted his teeth and stood up.After he entered, Han Jue activated the array formation again and closed the cave door.Han Jue turned and walked into the cave.Chen Santian suddenly grabbed Han Jue. The sword in his hand hung in front of Han Jue's neck and he shouted in a deep voice, \"Elder, let me go. Otherwise, I'll kill your disciple!\"\"\u2026\"The abode fell into silence.Chen Santian looked around uneasily.Han Jue said faintly, \"I don't have a disciple.\"Chen Santian's body froze when he heard this.Clang!His sword fell to the ground, and he suddenly knelt down, forcing a smile. \"Senior\u2026 I was just joking\u2026\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceHe could sense Han Jue's cultivation level.The ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm.Impossible!It must be a facade!To be able to directly suppress me and predict my background, this guy must be an expert!Han Jue walked further inside the cave and said, \"Follow me.\"Chen Santian quickly followed.Han Jue came to his own wooden bed and sat down. Chen Santian knelt in front of him and appeared very respectful.Is he really the eldest core disciple of the Viridescent Nether Cult?Han Jue originally wanted to hand Chen Santian over to Fairy Xi Xuan, but if he did that, Chen Santian would definitely escape with his life.He didn't have the strength to suppress Chen Santian. At most, he could defeat him.The reason why Chen Santian didn't dare to flee was because he overestimated Han Jue's strength.In any case, with the Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe protecting his body, he wasn't afraid that Chen Santian would ambush him.Not only could the Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe protect his body, but it could also protect his head. In any case, Chen Santian couldn't hurt him!Han Jue said softly, \"Pick up your sword and stab me with all your strength.\"Chen Santian shivered and wailed. \"Elder, I understand my mistake! I know I did wrong!\"\"Come on. If you don't try, you'll keep thinking about ambushing me from now on.\"\"I don't dare\u2026\"\"I won't blame you. Just do it.\"\"Elder, I'll kowtow to you!\"Chen Santian almost cried as he hurriedly kowtowed to Han Jue.He thought Han Jue was setting him up and finding a reason to kill him.In any case, if he made a move, it would definitely not end well for him.Han Jue was speechless. Am I that scary?He had read Chen Santian's background introduction and thought this person was extremely cruel and would rather die than submit. He didn't expect him to be so cowardly.\"From today onwards, you will stay here and plant spirit herbs for me.

Before Chen Santian could react, three sword shadows pierced through his chest and blood splattered all over the ground.Chen Santian's eyes widened. His eyes were bloodshot as he turned his head in disbelief.Han Jue waved his right hand expressionlessly.The sword shadows turned around and blew up his head.Chen Santian, the inherent fiend, was dead!This time, it was even more straightforward than a year ago. Chen Santian didn't even have the time to dodge.Until Chen Santian died, Han Jue didn't know how strong he was.Chen Santian had long let down his guard. He thought Han Jue would keep him alive for some purpose. He didn't expect to be killed today.The moment Chen Santian's corpse fell to the ground, a light ball emerged from his body.Han Jue raised his eyebrows.Could it be\u2026The ball of light changed rapidly and turned into a human figure. This person had an aged face and his eyes were filled with evilness.He first glanced at Chen Santian's corpse, then he stared at Han Jue.The cave abode was silent.Han Jue sighed.So the old is really here.The old man snorted coldly. \"Are you sighing because you regret it? You're dead for killing my disciple. State your name!\"Han Jue said expressionlessly, \"I'm Cao Cao, what about you?\"\"Viridescent Nether Cult, Zhang Kunmo!\"\"Oh.\"Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.com\"Hmph, just wait for your death!\"After Zhang Kunmo finished speaking, he disappeared.[Zhang Kunmo has hatred towards you. Current Hatred: 5 stars]5 stars!Very high!Han Jue panicked.He quickly checked his interpersonal relationships and heaved a sigh of relief.Eighth level of the Nascent Soul realm!Just like that?From his tone, Han Jue thought he was a Soul Formation realm cultivator.Only a Nascent Soul!Han Jue stood up and began to search for Chen Santian's storage bag and storage ring.After a person died, their ownership over their storage rings and storage bags would terminate.This brat is quite rich. There were countless spirit stones and pills, as well as many talismans and curses. But he had few pieces of equipment and not even a single manual.Only bring money when going out?Han Jue poured everything into his Little Universe Belt.He then waved his right hand, and his fire spirit energy turned into raging flames that wrapped around Chen Santian's corpse, burning it into ashes.Han Jue returned to his bed and continued cultivating.\u2026Time passed quickly.Eight years passed.Han Jue had finally reached the ninth level of the Golden Core realm. Besides the Thunder cultivation potential, the other five were still at the first level of the Golden Core realm.No one would believe it if news of this speed of breakthrough were to spread.Han Jue started to cultivate his wind cultivation potential.It could increase his flying speed, and was suitable for escaping from danger.Half a month later.Someone visited.It was Xing Hongxuan.\"Husband, are you there?\"This content is taken from lightnovelworld.comHearing this, Han Jue's mouth twitched.After so many years, Xing Hongxuan's cultivation level had already reached the third stage of the Foundation Establishment realm. It seemed like Daoist Jingxu was treating her well.Back when she was still at the Qi Refinement realm, her breakthrough speed hadn't been this fast.Han Jue thought for a moment, then waved his hand to close the array formation at the entrance. The stone door then opened wide.Xing Hongxuan quickly walked in. Upon seeing Han Jue, she beamed with joy.She first sized up the situation inside the cave abode, then walked to Han Jue's side and sat down. Then, she leaned against him.Han Jue frowned and said, \"Miss Xing, please behave appropriately. I haven't agreed to be your husband.\"Xing Hongxuan pursed her lips. \"Weren't you very excited when you were in the outer sect?\"Han Jue felt awkward, but his expression did not change, and he looked cold.Xing Hongxuan waved her right hand, and ten medicinal bottles appeared on the ground.\"These are Pure Jade Pills,\" Xing Hongxuan said with a proud smile. \"I've accumulated them over the years.\"I don't believe you won't be tempted!Han Jue's expression softened. \"Take it back. I don't need it anymore.\"Xing Hongxuan's smile froze as she frowned.After that, her expression changed greatly, and she asked with a trembling voice, \"Could it be that you've already\u2026\"Han Jue smiled.Xing Hongxuan immediately jumped towards him, but he blocked her with his spirit energy.\"Miss Xing, if you want to be my companion, you have to cultivate harder. Otherwise, after hundreds of years, I will become an immortal and you will become white bones. Your deep love would then be my punishment,\" Han Jue said seriously.Xing Hongxuan calmed down upon hearing this.He has a point\u2026She immediately stood up and said, \"You're right. I can't be your burden. I'll help you ask for Golden Core cultivation pills.\"With that, she took back the medicine bottle on the ground and walked towards the cave entrance.\"Miss Xing, don't tell anyone about my breakthrough.\"Han Jue reminded her. His cultivation speed was too astonishing. If news of this got out, he wouldn't be able to cultivate in peace.Xing Hongxuan turned and smiled. \"Don't worry. I'm also afraid that you will attract the attention of other girls.\"Her smile was as beautiful as a flower, and it was extremely moving.Han Jue quickly suppressed his palpitations.What a terrifying woman!I almost fell for it!The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comAfter Xing Hongxuan left, Han Jue waved his hand and activated the array formation again. He closed the stone gate and continued his cultivation.\"Xing Hongxuan\u2026 Fairy Xi Xuan\u2026 both have the word 'Xuan' in their names. Could it be that they are related?\"Han Jue held his breath and thought silently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In reality, it had been even longer.The two sects weren't the only ones in the cultivation world. There were other sects as well. Their enemies weren't just each other.It was precisely because of this that the Viridescent Nether Cult and the Jade Pure Sect didn't dare to make a move. They were afraid that both sides would suffer losses and give the other sects a chance to reap the benefits.In a dark hall, eight figures were meditating.Zhang Kunmo was among them.The leader was a man in a blood-red robe. His hair was black and white, and he had an indifferent expression. He held a horsetail whisk in his hand.He was Duan Tongtian, Cult Leader of the Viridescent Nether Cult!\"You still haven't caught Li Qingzi after so long?\" Duan Tongtian asked in a deep voice.The seven elders fell silent.They had chased after Li Qingzi for nearly twenty years, and each time, Li Qingzi was lucky enough to escape.Li Qingzi intentionally didn't return to the Jade Pure Sect. He was acting as the decoy for the sect.Zhang Kunmo said, \"Let's just ignore him and attack the Jade Pure Sect directly. My disciple was killed there. We put in so much effort on Santian. Aren't you going to seek revenge?\"He gritted his teeth at the thought of Han Jue.Back then, he had threatened him. But after so many years, he still hadn't taken action.He could even imagine Han Jue mocking him for boasting.\"I think so, too. Our overall strength has already surpassed the Jade Pure Sect's. We can attack them directly!\"\"During the Demonic Path Convention, the other sects have already declared that unless we conquer the neighboring Jade Pure Sect, they will not submit to us.\"\"That's right. If we can't even defeat a nearby orthodox sect, how can we be the leader of the demonic path sects?\"\"I'm willing to lead my disciples to attack the Jade Pure Sect!\"\"Other than Li Qingzi, there's another old monster in the Jade Pure Sect.\"The elders began to discuss amongst themselves.Duan Tongtian's eyes flickered, but he didn't say anything.After a long time, all the elders stopped and turned to look at him, waiting for him to make a decision.Duan Tongtian said, \"I'm preparing to break through to the Soul Formation realm. Let's launch the attack after my success. By then, it would be very easy to defeat the Jade Pure Sect.\"Soul Formation realm!New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.comThe elders looked at him in shock.Zhang Kunmo took a deep breath and asked, \"Leader, are you confident?\"Duan Tongtian said calmly, \"I've been preparing for this for decades. I'm 90% confident. Thirty more years, it won't be long!\"Thirty years!To mortals, it might be half a lifetime.But to them, it wasn't long at all.\u2026It had been ten years since Xing Hongxuan left.Han Jue cultivated his wind cultivation potential to the ninth level of the Golden Core realm and his fire cultivation potential to the third.Ever since his thunder cultivation potential reached the ninth level of the Golden Core realm, cultivating the other cultivation potentials was twice as easy.Han Jue already saw the Nascent Soul realm waving at him.He grew stronger every day. It was a wonderful feeling. So, cultivating in seclusion wasn't boring at all.Only by reaching the Nascent Soul realm as soon as possible could one truly emerge from the weak!Han Jue was already eighty-eight years old, and he was at the ninth level of the Golden Core Realm. In the cultivation world, there was definitely no other person as fast as him.But he was still unsatisfied.Even reaching the Nascent Soul realm wasn't enough.He wanted to cultivate until the end, until he was absolutely invincible!One fine day.Chang Yue'er came to visit.Han Jue closed the array formation and welcomed her into the residence.\"Junior Brother, I'm here to see you. I also brought you some natural treasures. Planting them by the pool will make the Spirit Qi in your cave abode even richer. In the future, it might become the cave abode with the richest Spirit Qi in the entire Jade Pure Sect,\" Chang Yue'er said with a smile.She walked to the edge of the pool and began scattering seeds.Han Jue smiled. \"Thank you, Senior.\"\"Don't thank me. It was all given to me by Master. I'm just helping out with some manual labor,\" Chang Yue'er said with a smile.Han Jue couldn't help but think about Fairy Xi Xuan.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comHe uttered a word of gratitude in his head.Chang Yue'er continued, \"Ever since you went into seclusion, Jade Serene Peak welcomed several new disciples. Junior Iron, who was ranked behind you, passed away two years ago.\"Elder Iron has died?Han Jue was stunned.He hurriedly clicked on his interpersonal relationships and realized that he could no longer find Elder Iron's profile picture.He was gone.\"Speaking of him, his cultivation potential was so bad. He should have spent his entire life in the outer sect. To be able to come to the inner sect, he definitely had no more regrets. However, before his death, he wanted to see you. His apprentice alchemist told me that.\"\"Why did he want to see me?\" Han Jue asked with a complicated expression.He used to hate Elder Iron.But now that he thought about it, Elder Iron had never hurt him. It could even be said that he had raised him.Elder Iron's death caused Han Jue's disgust towards him to disappear without a trace. He even felt a bit melancholy.This is the path of cultivation.People always die on the way.But, I can't die halfway!Han Jue became more determined to pursue immortality.Chang Yue'er shook her head and said, \"How would I know? Did you know each other before?\"Only a few people knew that Han Jue and Elder Iron knew each other. Chang Yue'er wasn't one of them.\"It doesn't matter anymore. Senior, cultivate harder. If you die too, I will be sad.\"Han Jue was sincere this time.After coming to this world, he didn't know many people. There were even fewer people who had treated him well.Chang Yue'er turned to look at him and smiled. \"Hmph, stinky little junior. I thought you didn't care about me.\"Han Jue smiled and shook his head.The two of them started chatting.Most of the time, Chang Yue'er was the one talking. She described everything that had happened in the inner sect.Zhou Fan had completely risen up and became an influential figure in the inner sect. He succeeded in his challenge against the eldest disciple of Sword Peak with his Foundation Establishment cultivation. He won over his companion and shocked the entire sect. But on the second day after their wedding, he divorced the woman again. It was a huge controversy.Updated from lightnovelworld.comCurrently, Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou had already become the representatives of the Heavenly Thunder Peak. They were both personal disciples, and Mo Fuchou was even a core candidate.Xing Hongxuan had been cultivating at Main Peak. So, she wasn't very famous.\"Alright, it's time for me to go back and cultivate. I'll try to accompany you on the road of cultivation for a bit longer.\" Chang Yue'er playfully smiled and then left.Han Jue sighed.Although Chang Yue'er was joking, Han Jue felt sad when he heard her words.Han Jue was someone who wanted to live forever. Chang Yue'er's talent was far inferior to his, so she definitely wouldn't live as long as him!However, Han Jue wasn't a pretentious person and quickly adjusted his mentality.If he had the ability in the future, he could also help those close to him.For example, Fairy Xi Xuan, Chang Yue'er, and Xing Hongxuan.Should Mo Zhu be included?Han Jue pondered silently.He suddenly raised his right hand and used his finger as a sword to write two words on the stone wall across him.Elder Iron.He stood up and bowed at the name.It was a late farewell.Hopefully, Elder Iron will be reborn in a good family.After that, Han Jue continued to meditate and cultivate.\u2026It had been another ten years.Han Jue's fire and water cultivation potentials had reached the ninth and seventh levels of the Golden Core realm, respectively. He was only left with earth and wood cultivation potentials.This speed was already amazing, but he was somewhat dissatisfied.He began to rummage through his Little Universe Belt to check the medicinal pills left behind by Chen Santian.Chen Santian was also a Golden Core cultivator. Perhaps he had Golden Core cultivation pills.Unfortunately, no.This brat's medicinal pills were mostly poison, aphrodisiacs, and all sorts of despicable drugs.Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experience\"As expected of a f**king member of the Cult!\"Han Jue couldn't help but curse.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Han Jue began cultivating his wood cultivation potential.Lines of words suddenly appeared in front of him:[Congratulations on reaching 100 years old. You have unlocked the Simulation Trial function.][Simulation Trial: You can set your opponent's cultivation level and level of strength to simulate a battle. You can also detect all living beings within a radius of a hundred miles and simulate a battle with them. The result of the battle will not affect the physical and mental state of the opponent. The number of times you activate this function is unlimited.]Simulation Trial?It can even detect living beings within a radius of fifty kilometers?Han Jue was first stunned, then pleasantly surprised.This is an overpowered function!Han Jue didn't know how strong he was. He could finally give it a try now.He immediately activated the Simulation Trial function and closed his eyes.He came to a dark space.[You can choose a character in interpersonal relationships to be your opponent.]Han Jue immediately chose Li Qingzi.He wanted to see the difference in strength between him and the Sect Master.Soon, Li Qingzi appeared in front of him. This Li Qingzi was expressionless and looked like a puppet.The battle began!Li Qingzi took out a golden ruler and attacked Han Jue.Han Jue took out the Qilin Sword and used the Seven Illusionary Steps to distance himself from him.He quickly executed the Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique, causing three sword shadows to appear out of thin air and shoot towards Li Qingzi.Li Qingzi quickly waved his ruler, dispersed the sword shadows, and chased after him.Han Jue raised his hand and struck out with the Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal. The six attributes of spirit energy kept changing, and the Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal collided with Li Qingzi.Initially, Li Qingzi was still able to break the Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal, but he was quickly sent flying.Han Jue raised his eyebrows.It seemed like his Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal was very powerful!No wonder it could suppress the Great Grand Elder's essence soul.Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.However, the Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal didn't hurt Li Qingzi. He would always launch his attack again immediately after.Han Jue wasn't in a hurry. He was already very satisfied to be on par with Li Qingzi.The battle lasted for ten minutes before Han Jue lost.Li Qingzi's Heavenly Constellation Golden Body was extremely powerful. When spells hit him, it didn't cause any substantial damage.However!Han Jue discovered that using the Qilin Sword to execute the Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique would make his attack more damaging. It could break through Li Qingzi's Heavenly Constellation Golden Body and cause him to bleed.As expected of an unparalleled sword!However, he would only be able to break through the defense, not claim victory.He then lowered Li Qingzi's cultivation.Seventh level of the Nascent Soul realm!He still couldn't win!Sixth level of the Nascent Soul realm!A draw!Fifth level of the Nascent Soul realm!He slaughtered Li Qingzi.Han Jue activated the Qilin Sword and executed the Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique. The three sword shadows tore Li Qingzi's body apart.Not bad! Not bad!To kill a cultivator five levels above me is up to standard considering my cultivation technique, cultivation potential, sword technique, and unparalleled sword potential!Han Jue thought silently.Subsequently, he lowered Li Qingzi's cultivation level to the ninth level of the Golden Core Realm and realized that his spirit energy far exceeded Li Qingzi's.The power of the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique was evident. Cultivating all six types of cultivation potentials gave an abundant pool of spirit energy. He could instantly kill Li Qingzi of the same cultivation level as him without using the Qilin Sword.When his consciousness returned to reality, Han Jue opened his eyes.I can kill a fifth-level Nascent Soul realm expert now. When I break through to the Nascent Soul realm, wouldn't I be able to compete with a Soul Formation realm cultivator?Han Jue thought excitedly, but then shook his head.The strength of a Soul Formation realm cultivator was definitely vastly different from that of a Nascent Soul realm cultivator. He couldn't let his imagination wild, or else he might fail.I have to think that I can't beat a Soul Formation realm cultivator. That's the only way to be cautious.Han Jue warned himself silently.Only wood and earth cultivation potentials left.This content is taken from lightnovelworld.comHan Jue was full of fighting spirit. He felt that he would be able to cultivate both to the ninth level of the Golden Core Realm within ten years!As more and more cultivation potentials reached the ninth level of the Golden Core realm, the cultivation speed of the remaining ones became faster and faster. Ten years was enough for him to cultivate the two remaining potentials to the ninth level!\u2026Ten years went by quickly.Han Jue didn't leave the cave abode even half a step. He practically cultivated the entire time.He had successfully cultivated all his cultivation potentials to the ninth level of the Golden Core realm. Next, he would begin cultivation to perfection.Han Jue was pleasantly surprised to discover that he could actually absorb six types of Spirit Qi at the same time.It was something new!Can it be that the ninth level of the Golden Core Realm is a threshold?Han Jue soon discovered that absorbing six types of Spirit Qi at the same time wasn't too slow for his cultivation speed. Overall, it was faster than before.Good news!Han Jue was confident and continued to cultivate.Half a year later, all his cultivation potentials had reached perfection.He could finally cultivate his Nascent Soul!Han Jue didn't relax. He started to prepare for the tribulation transcendence!He established a barrier covering the entire connate cave abode!\u2026Jade Pure Sect, Main Peak.Inside the hall.Li Qingzi sat at the end of the table. The Elders of the eighteen peaks were gathered. Besides them, there were several other Elders.Everyone's expression was very grave.Heavenly Thunder Peak's Old Immortal Daoist Thunder's expression was really pale. He gritted his teeth and asked, \"Is this true?\"Li Qingzi sighed and said, \"It's absolutely true. Duan Tongtian had just transcended tribulation a month ago. He's now consolidating his cultivation. He's already a Soul Formation realm almighty!\"Soul Formation realm!Everyone was scared out of their mind. It was as if a mountain was pressing down on them, making it hard for them to breathe.Even Fairy Xi Xuan didn't look good.\"Where's Master? Hasn't he already cultivated his essence soul? Is he already close to the Soul Formation realm?\" Daoist Jingxu hurriedly asked.Li Qingzi sighed and said, \"No, his essence soul is only a mystical power. He seemed to have suffered some kind of blow previously and gave up on it decades ago. He's still cultivating bitterly now. Although he's already at the ninth level of the Nascent Soul realm, there's still an insurmountable gap between him and the Soul Formation realm.\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experienceThe hall fell into deathly silence. Everyone was stressed.An elder couldn't help but ask, \"Then, what should we do? Ask for help?\"Li Qingzi sighed and said, \"I've already sent a letter to other orthodox sects asking for help. I haven't received any reply yet.\"The elders began to discuss amongst themselves.\"Soul Formation realm! Even if all of us joined forces, we still might not be able to defeat him!\"\"Other than Duan Tongtian, there are many Nascent Soul cultivators in the Viridescent Nether Cult.\"\"Sigh. Who would know that the goddamned Cult would produce a Soul Formation realm cultivator? Our end has come.\"\"We definitely won't be able to win in a direct confrontation. Why don't we escape?\"\"How are we going to escape? Where are we going to escape to? Are we going to abandon our centuries of establishment?\"The elders were all talking at once, and their tone was very bad.No one could speak calmly in the face of such a crisis.Li Qingzi sighed, his face full of worry.\u2026Kuang\u2014The bell rang on Jade Serene Peak. All the disciples gathered in front of the main door of the Jade Serene Hall.After entering the hall, the disciples found mats to sit on.Fairy Xi Xuan glanced around and frowned slightly.Han Jue didn't come again.Forget it.All the disciples looked at Fairy Xi Xuan. There was no nervousness nor anticipation.They thought it was about the upcoming inner sect assessment.\"From the latest information, the cult leader of the Viridescent Nether Cult, Duan Tongtian, has already reached the Soul Formation realm. If there are no accidents, the Cult will launch a large-scale invasion against us in a few years.\"Fairy Xi Xuan's expression was indifferent as she spoke.The disciples were stunned for a moment before exploding.\"Soul Formation realm!\"\"Impossible!\"\"Do we have Soul Formation cultivators?\"\"Of course not, Soul Formation realm only exists in the legends!\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experience\"It's over\u2026 No wonder the Cult is becoming more rampant lately\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jade Pure Sect has been established for almost a thousand years, how can it be destroyed by the Cult? I don't usually ask you all to contribute to the sect, but since the sect is in trouble, all of you must be prepared to fight. From today onwards, all of you are not allowed to leave the Jade Pure Sect. Focus on your cultivation and prepare for the battle!\"Fairy Xi Xuan swept her gaze over everyone as she spoke.The strong aura of a Nascent Soul cultivator erupted, enveloping the entire hall.The disciples felt a chill in their hearts. Even though they were afraid, they didn't dare to show it.As matters stood, there was no other way.They had all dealt with the Cult before and knew that the consequences of surrendering would be worse.\u2026Inside the connate cave abode, thunder rumbled.Han Jue was transcending the tribulation.Under the barrier's enclosure, the sound and aura of the heavenly thunder did not leak out.This heavenly tribulation was different from the ones he encountered before. The lightning transformed into a dragon, and it was even more destructive than before.Nevertheless, it couldn't break through the Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe's defense.In order to prevent the plants in the cave abode from being destroyed, Han Jue used his spirit energy to protect them. Fortunately, the lightning only kept bombarding him.The cave wasn't big, but it was very high. The dark clouds blocked the hole on top.During the tribulation, Han Jue had nightmares from time to time.There were all kinds of nightmares, including the death of his friends and Master, as well as returning to his previous life and realizing it was all just a dream.Fortunately, Han Jue had a strong will and these nightmares couldn't affect him at all.The inner evil didn't even have a chance to emerge.\"Nascent Soul realm, I'm definitely going to break through!\"Han Jue thought excitedly.As he continued to circulate his spirit energy according to the cultivation method, the six spirit energies in his body formed a vortex once again. As they gathered on his Golden Core, the outline of a nascent soul could be vaguely seen.He was already close to the Nascent Soul realm.\"Junior!\"Chang Yue'er's voice came from outside the cave abode. Han Jue thought it was a hallucination. He had heard it before, so he didn't take it to heart.Outside the cave abode.Chang Yue'er called out a few times, but Han Jue didn't answer.She couldn't help but frown as she muttered, \"Stinky Junior, you're cultivating too seriously. The sect is in crisis, but you don't even want to come out.\"She thought about it and decided to stay outside the cave abode. She walked to a tree not far away and started meditating.If the Viridescent Nether Cult attacked the Jade Pure Sect from this side, Han Jue would definitely be the first to face trouble. She had to protect him.Of course, with her strength, it was very difficult for her to protect him. But when Han Jue woke up from his cultivation, she could tell him immediately and bring him back to the inner sect to hide.Ten days later.Han Jue finally reached the Nascent Soul realm, and his spiritual strength soared!Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceThe six types of spirit energy merged into a new and powerful spirit energy.Six Paths spirit energy!A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.[Congratulations on breaking through to the Nascent Soul realm.

It wasn't difficult for Han Jue.A mystical power was different from usual magic. He would be able to use it immediately after understanding it. Practice wasn't necessary.But of course, he could still practice it if he wanted to. It would make him more proficient with it.At the same time.Outside the cave abode.Chang Yue'er was meditating and cultivating.She was already used to cultivating nearby.She opened her eyes to look at the cave abode and muttered, \"Stinky Junior, you still aren't coming out. Luckily, the Cult didn't invade us.\"She wanted to leave many times, but she was afraid that she would miss the time when Han Jue came out of seclusion.Chang Yue'er sighed and closed her eyes again.She liked him, after all.Maybe wait a little longer.\u2026The next day.Han Jue successfully grasped the Heavenly Punishment Ghost Deity Sword!He opened his attributes panel:[Name: Han Jue][Lifespan: 111/998][Race: Mortal][Cultivation: First level of the Nascent Soul realm][Technique: Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique (Can be inherited)][Magic: Unparalleled Finger Divine Sword, Seven Illusionary Steps, Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique (Unparalleled), Nine Dragons Devil Expelling Seal][Mystical Power: Six Paths Soul Absorption Technique, Heavenly Punishment Ghost Deity Sword][Equipment: Golden Cicada's Mystic Divine Robe (Grade Seven Numinous Treasure), Little Universe Belt, Qilin Sword][Cultivation Potential: Spiritual Physique of the Six Paths.

So, Han Jue decided to allow it.Continue cultivating!\u2026A year later.Chang Yue'er suddenly stood up and looked into the distance in fear.Thunderclouds appeared above the eighteen peaks of the Jade Pure Sect, surging violently and covering the sky.On the west side of the Jade Pure Sect, fiendish cultivators charged out of the forest one after another. A huge army of them flew on their swords and sped towards the Jade Pure Sect. Fiendish aura gathered together like a sea of darkness.The Cult was here!Chang Yue'er immediately panicked.Instinctively, she wanted to call out to Han Jue. But on second thought, the Cult was attacking from the other side. Junior Han's cave was nicely out of the way.If she woke him up and brought him back to the inner sect, it might actually end up worse.Chang Yue'er bit her lips, before leaping onto her sword and flying towards Jade Serene Peak.Inside the connate cave abode.Han Jue was cultivating when a notification appeared before his eyes.[Your sect, Jade Pure Sect, is currently under attack by the Viridescent Nether Cult.]Han Jue was stunned. He quickly reached out with his divine sense and saw the astounding scene of the Cult attacking the Jade Pure Sect.Why suddenly start fighting?Han Jue was already a Nascent Soul realm expert. His strength was far greater than before, so he naturally didn't panic.But the scale of the invasion was very large. He had to be cautious.Updated from lightnovelworld.comHan Jue didn't go to help immediately.He activated the Simulation Trial function to detect everyone in Jade Pure Sect and let the system search for the strongest person.[Duan Tongtian: First level of the Soul Formation realm, Cult Leader of the Viridescent Nether Cult.]Soul Formation realm!Han Jue shuddered.So fierce?Han Jue's first reaction was to run.Jade Pure Sect has no chance!Calm down!I'm no longer the same as before.

Their Daoist robes were torn and their hair was disheveled.

Our leader is dead!\"\"Damn it, the Jade Pure Sect is so strong?\"\"Jade Pure Sect has been hiding a mighty figure!\"\"Cult Leader is at the Soul Formation realm. He was still defeated by that mighty figure?\"\"Crap, they're about to launch a counterattack!\"\u2026Li Qingzi heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the fiendish cultivators fleeing in all directions.Good that they're escaping. At least we will have fewer casualties.Updated from lightnovelworld.comWe will let them pay it all back another day!With Duan Tongtian's death, the Cult wouldn't dare to attack the sect for a long time.Jade Pure Sect could even take the initiative to attack!He turned to look at Han Jue, who was healing Fairy Xi Xuan.I can't let this kid leave the sect!Li Qingzi made a firm decision.He could no longer break through. He could only rely on others.Being able to kill a Soul Formation realm cultivator with a single sword strike showed Han Jue's terrifying power. Li Qingzi needed him on Jade Pure Sect's side.He immediately announced, \"From today onwards, Han Jue will be the Vice Sect Master of the Jade Pure Sect!\"Upon hearing this, the elders were all moved, but none of them refuted.\"I object!\"Li Qingzi glared at the source of the sound. But it was Han Jue.Han Jue said righteously, \"I only want to cultivate. I don't want to be the vice sect master.\"Being the vice sect master must be tiring. I don't want it to hold back my cultivation.\"Erm\u2026\" Li Qingzi couldn't help but feel conflicted.Great Grand Elder said, \"Let him be an Elder. Just give him a title and let him enjoy the benefits of a vice sect master. Unless the sect is in trouble, no one is allowed to disturb him.\"Han Jue nodded in satisfaction.He liked this!\"Right, that person just now was at the Void Amalgamation Realm\u2026\" Han Jue suddenly said.Honestly, he was a little disturbed.After all, the enemy had escaped.Great Grand Elder smiled and said, \"He's only left with his essence soul. If I'm not wrong, Duan Tongtian agreed to help him recover his corporeal body and obtained the chance to break through in return. The reason why Duan Tongtian was stalling for time just now was probably to absorb the Spirit Qi and vitality of the Jade Pure Sect. This should be some kind of secret technique.\"As for the Demon Taming Sect, there's even less to worry about. The North State is too far away from us. It can even be said to be at the other end of the world.\"Great Grand Elder didn't even seem concerned about Xiao'e.But Han Jue was still worried.One should never think like that!There's still a chance things may go wrong!Updated from lightnovelworld.comI need to cultivate in seclusion!I must surpass the Void Amalgamation realm as soon as possible!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The destroyed inner sect cities also needed to be rebuilt.The disciples weren't too sad. Instead, they were excited.There was actually a mighty figure in the Jade Pure Sect who could easily kill a Soul Formation realm cultivator!The elders of the eighteen peaks told their disciples about the battle with Duan Tongtian. They didn't reveal Han Jue's identity and only mentioned a Deity Slaying Elder.Deity Slaying Elder!Since that day, every disciple of the sect revered the Deity Slaying Elder!They were curious about everything related to him.That evening\u2026At Jade Serene Peak\u2026After Fairy Xi Xuan pacified all the disciples, she asked them to leave, leaving only Han Jue behind.Although the Jade Serene Peak's disciples witnessed Han Jue killing a lot of fiendish cultivators, they didn't associate him with the Deity Slaying Elder.Even Chang Yue'er didn't suspect him.Before she left, she looked at Han Jue.After such a calamity, Han Jue was as calm as ever.She was impressed.She was prepared to wait for Han Jue outside. She had something to say to him.The door to the Jade Serene Hall closed.Only Han Jue and Fairy Xi Xuan were left inside.Fairy Xi Xuan had already recovered. She was still as beautiful as ever, like a fairy from heaven.She stared straight at him.Han Jue lowered his head. But he wasn't afraid.No matter what he did now, Jade Pure Sect would definitely not expel him.Fairy Xi Xuan also had no reason to blame him.\"Don't you have anything to say?\" Fairy Xi Xuan asked.Han Jue looked up and asked doubtfully, \"What should I say?\"Fairy Xi Xuan harrumphed. \"Who exactly are you? Why have you come to the Jade Pure Sect?\"Li Qingzi could ignore it, but as his master, she had to know.Her disciple was stronger than her. How could she be the master?No wonder he never needed my guidance\u2026New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.com\"Should I call you Fellow Daoist Han from now on?\"Facing Fairy Xi Xuan's teasing, Han Jue helplessly said, \"I really don't have any background. You should have been aware after what Junior Iron told you. Do you not believe in my talent?\"Fairy Xi Xuan narrowed her eyes and said, \"Even if you're talented, where did you get your abilities? You can't just create them out of thin air.\"A Nascent Soul realm cultivator killing a Soul Formation realm cultivator is too ridiculous!It had never been heard of.Fairy Xi Xuan was sure that Sect Master and the other elders didn't believe it, too.\"Okay, I will tell you. But please don't tell anyone. When I was young, I was told by an immortal in my dream that my talent was unparalleled and I would definitely become an immortal. However, it would be a rough path ahead. So, I didn't dare to cause trouble and cultivated in seclusion every day,\" Han Jue said seriously.Fairy Xi Xuan fell silent.Han Jue didn't say anything, either.After a long while\u2026Fairy Xi Xuan spoke again, \"If that's the case, why did you step forward to save us? The sect didn't treat you well, and I believe you wouldn't call it your home either.\"Han Jue replied, \"That's true. I've lived for a hundred years, but there aren't many people I care about. However, the person I care about the most is in the Jade Pure Sect. She even said that she would rather perish together with the sect.\"Let me see the increase in favorability![Fairy Xi Xuan's favorability of you has increased. Current favorability: 3.5 stars.]Only 3.5 stars?As expected of my master. She's indeed different from other women!The colder she is, the more I like it!Han Jue exclaimed in his head.Fairy Xi Xuan changed the topic and asked, \"What are your plans from now on? Continue your seclusion?\"\"Yes. That Void Amalgamation realm demon might come at any moment. I have to quickly become stronger.\"\"Go ahead, then.\"\"Ok.\"Han Jue immediately stood up and left.For some reason, he was slightly disappointed.When he reached the door, he turned around and asked, \"Master, is the end of your lifespan approaching?\"Fairy Xi Xuan was stunned and asked, \"What do you mean?\"Curse me to death?\"I'm thinking about Junior Iron. I don't want Master to leave this world. If this day really comes, I hope Master can inform me in advance.\"Han Jue was being frank.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comFairy Xi Xuan said unhappily, \"Get lost, I still have many years to live.\"Han Jue quickly ran away.Fairy Xi Xuan shook her head and laughed.She couldn't help but think of the battle again. It still felt like a dream.She didn't expect such a powerful figure to be hidden among her disciples.However, this kid actually saw her as the most important person.She was surprised.\u2026After an hour, Han Jue finally freed himself from Chang Yue'er and returned to his cave abode.Sitting on the familiar wooden bed, Han Jue yawned and stretched.\"What a marvelous day. I'm actually so powerful.\"Han Jue smiled proudly. Killing a Soul Formation Stage cultivator with a single strike. I feel awesome!Especially now that the higher-ups of the Jade Pure Sect treated him differently\u2026Is this the posturing that's often written in novels?Actually, it feels really good.Sure enough, it is correct to continue to train in seclusion the entire time. If I had stopped training a few years earlier, I would've missed this opportunity.I must try my best to cultivate.Han Jue thought silently.If this crisis had happened a year or two ago when he hadn't broken through to the Nascent Soul realm, he definitely wouldn't have been able to defeat Duan Tongtian.If that was the case, he would have no choice but to run away. Those women who were his potential companions would all die.Thinking of this, Han Jue became even more determined to cultivate.Before he became absolutely invincible, he had to spend all his time on cultivation.Although Duan Tongtian was dead, the potential danger was still present.The Demon Taming Sect!Han Jue was full of fighting spirit.He wanted to surpass everyone in the Demon Taming Sect before they would come for revenge!Han Jue thought as he entered his cultivation state.\u2026Half a year passed in a flash.Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experienceThe inner sect of the Jade Pure Sect had recovered completely. Having recovered from their injuries, Li Qingzi and the rest started to mobilize a large number of disciples to attack the Viridescent Nether Cult.Han Jue wasn't disturbed, and Fairy Xi Xuan didn't send any disciples to find him.Duan Tongtian and Zhang Kunmo were dead. In terms of the number of experts, the Cult was definitely no match for the Jade Pure Sect!In terms of mentality, Jade Pure Sect also had an absolute advantage.A year later.Under the Jade Pure Sect's powerful attack, the Viridescent Nether Cult was defeated battle after battle and eventually fled from their headquarters.The cultivation world of Great Yan was shocked!The Jade Pure Sect's prestige had greatly increased!At the same time, Han Jue reached the second level of the Nascent Soul realm.It took him two and a half years to advance by a level.It was indeed not easy to break through the Nascent Soul realm levels.However, compared to before, his cultivation speed had increased by quite a bit. This was because he did not need to cultivate each of his cultivation potentials separately. He could directly absorb all six types of Spirit Qi and convert them into Six Paths spirit energy!Ever since he broke through to the ninth level of the Golden Core realm, he had been able to cultivate in such a manner. To a Nascent Soul realm cultivator, it was extremely helpful.One fine day.Chang Yue'er came to visit.\"The sect has gathered quite a number of natural treasures that can help increase the Spirit Qi in your cave abode. I'll help you plant them. There's also a Spirit Qi gathering array formation,\" Chang Yue'er said with a smile after entering the cave abode.She already knew that the Deity Slaying Elder was Han Jue.When she heard about it, her favorability toward him increased to 5.5 stars!She had heard this news from Fairy Xi Xuan, so she didn't doubt it.Junior Han was truly an unprecedented genius!No!He must be a proud son of the heavens!Han Jue nodded and said, \"Thank you, Senior.\"Chang Yue'er started to get busy. As she set up the array formation, she smiled and said, \"You're already the Deity Slaying Elder. Can I still be your senior?\"Han Jue smiled and said, \"As long as you cultivate seriously and hard enough, you will always be my senior.\"With such a high favorability, how can I reject her?Chang Yue'er isn't ugly!However, Han Jue didn't want to talk about love for the time being.

You just have to cultivate as hard as you can. Longevity is the most important thing for us cultivators.\"Hearing that, Chang Yue'er was even more demoralized.After that, she started to talk about what had happened in the sect recently.Sect Master had already led the disciples of ten peaks to attack the Viridescent Nether Cult. The remaining eight peaks were guarding the sect.Ever since the end of the attack by the Cult, the cultivation atmosphere in the inner sect was far more intense than before. All the disciples felt threatened.Zhou Fan had already reached the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment realm and was preparing to transcend the tribulation to the Golden Core realm.The sect's reputation in the cultivation world had greatly increased. They were like the leader of the orthodox sects now. As for strength, that was probably not the case.The story about the Deity Slaying Elder had also spread in the cultivation world.Although Han Jue wanted to keep a low profile, his pseudonym became famous from a single battle.After four hours, Chang Yue'er finally left.Once the Spirit Qi Gathering array formation was activated, the concentration of Spirit Qi in the cave abode began to increase noticeably.\"It seems that the status of the sect is also very important. It can affect my cultivation speed.\"Han Jue thought silently.He had to ask Li Qingzi for some pills.Then, Han Jue resumed his cultivation.\u2026Half a year later.A notification appeared before Han Jue's eyes.[The Viridescent Nether Cult has given up on targeting the Jade Pure Sect. You will obtain a piece of equipment and a spell manual.][Congratulations on obtaining the Demon Binding Rope and the Major Chiliocosm Thunderstorm.][Demon Binding Rope: It has a powerful binding effect.

It suited Han Jue's taste.He loved this kind of grand spell.Being cool was a lifelong endeavor.That night.The thunderclouds above the inner sect gathered and a terrifying heavenly aura enveloped the eighteen peaks, causing everyone to shiver in fear.\"The Cult is attacking us again?\"\"The Cult is already gone!\"\"Could it be some other demonic path sect?\"\"It's possible. After all, the Viridescent Nether Cult wasn't the strongest among the demonic path sects.\"\"Prepare for battle!\"\u2026The disciples of the eight peaks who remained in the inner sect were extremely nervous. Even the Elders were anxious.Soon, the Elders discovered that the spirit energy came from Han Jue's cave abode. And the rolling thunderclouds in the sky did not cause any damage to the inner sect.Is he practicing a spell?Wow\u2026The Elders were even more respectful towards Han Jue.The thunderclouds in the sky quickly dispersed, and the sect regained its peace.Not long after, an elder revealed that the abnormal sign just now was the Deity Slaying Elder practicing a spell.After this news spread, the disciples of the Jade Pure Sect felt much safer.Updated from lightnovelworld.comAfter that great battle several years ago, the Deity Slaying Elder was their greatest pillar of support.As long as the Deity Slaying Elder was around, nothing would happen to them!\u2026Two years later.Han Jue's cultivation was still at the second level of the Nascent Soul realm, but he was already close to the third.This was already incredibly fast. Ever since Han Jue joined the inner sect, most of the Nascent Soul cultivators in interpersonal relationships did not increase their cultivation.Han Jue was satisfied with his progress.After all, he still had more than 800 years to live. Breaking through to the Soul Formation realm was a sure thing.\"Are you free, Elder Han?\"A voice sounded from outside the cave abode.It was Li Qingzi.Han Jue immediately waved his hand and opened the cave abode's stone door to let him in.Li Qingzi's face was full of radiance. The Jade Pure Sect was in its prime. As the Sect Master, he naturally felt respected.He walked in and sized up this Connate Cave Abode. He smiled and said, \"This cave abode is still a little small for Elder Han. Do you want to go to Main Peak to cultivate?\"Han Jue shook his head. \"It's fine here. I'm already used to it.\"He sensed the auras of the others. Someone was waiting outside the cave. His cultivation was low. He probably just reached the Foundation Establishment realm.[Detected bearer of connate providence, checking its origin.]A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue. He immediately checked it.[Yang Tiandong possesses the bloodline of a Demon Saint. He was born half-human and half-demon. His cultivation potential is unparalleled. However, when he was young, he lost control and transformed into a demon. He injured his fellow disciples and was imprisoned by the Viridescent Nether Cult. Fortunately, the Jade Pure Sect saved him.]Eh?Another candidate for the protagonist?The Viridescent Nether Cult was quite impressive!They had two bearers of connate providence hidden inside!But actually, Jade Pure Sect also has two.There are quite a few geniuses, but the ones that live till the end are rare.\"Since that's the case, then I won't ask you anymore.

You can just casually give him some guidance. This guy has a lot of potential. When he grows up in the future, he can also be of great assistance to you,\" Li Qingzi asked with a smile.He turned to look at the cave entrance and summoned Yang Tiandong in.Yang Tiandong looked like he was in his early twenties. His facial features were well-defined, and although he wasn't considered handsome, he was still good-looking. There was a strong beastly aura about him, and the Daoist robe of the Jade Pure Sect looked somewhat incongruous on him.He knelt in front of Han Jue humbly.Han Jue subconsciously wanted to refuse.But on second thought, it wasn't bad to nurture disciples. They would be his helpers when they grew up.\"I can accept him as a disciple, but he needs to be taught a cultivation technique of the Jade Pure Sect. I'll only be responsible for teaching him spells and mystical powers,\" Han Jue said with a low voice.Li Qingzi smiled and said, \"There's no problem with the cultivation technique. I can give him the inner sect cultivation technique. But he wasn't a Jade Pure Sect disciple. He has to contribute to earn the chance to learn our secret techniques.\"\"Okay.\"Li Qingzi took out a bunch of tokens with the words \"Deity Slaying\" carved on them.\"These are your tokens. You can give them out to your disciples in the future.\"With that, he turned around and left.Han Jue waved his right hand, and a token flew towards Yang Tiandong. The other tokens were all kept in the Little Universe Belt.[Yang Tiandong has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 1 star.]Eh?Only 1 star?Han Jue narrowed his eyes and said, \"I have already deduced your background. Your name is Yang Tiandong, half-human and half-demon. You had been imprisoned by the Viridescent Nether Cult, right?\"Yang Tiandong looked up in shock.Before he came, Li Qingzi had specifically instructed him not to reveal his past.He didn't expect Han Jue to deduce it so easily.So this is the mighty figure who killed a Soul Formation realm cultivator with a single sword strike?[Yang Tiandong's favorability toward you has increased. Current favorability: 3 stars.]Yang Tiandong said respectfully, \"Master, you're indeed impressive. I didn't expect you to be able to deduce this much. I'm impressed.\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experienceHe paused as if making a decision.With a flip of his right hand, a red feather appeared in his hand. He said seriously, \"Master, this was left behind by my father, and it contains his ultimate technique. I need to reach the Soul Formation realm before I can cultivate it.

So what he said was probably true.\"Then, I'll accept it first. You can cultivate your spirit energy for ten years first. I like those who cultivate diligently. If you perform well, I'll teach you spells,\" Han Jue said.Yang Tiandong quickly thanked him.Han Jue pointed to the side and said, \"Find a place to meditate and cultivate.\"Then, he closed his eyes and began to cultivate.Yang Tiandong stood up and found a corner to sit down.He didn't dare to look at Han Jue for fear of offending him, so he immediately started cultivating.Soon, he discovered that the Spirit Qi in this cave abode was extremely dense.It was a good place for cultivation!\u2026Ever since the Spirit Qi Gathering array formation and the new natural treasures were added to the cave abode, the Spirit Qi there became increasingly dense. Han Jue's cultivation was more and more efficient.In the blink of an eye, ten years had passed.At the same time, Han Jue reached the fourth level of the Nascent Soul realm.This sort of breakthrough speed definitely surpassed mortals.According to this cultivation speed, breaking through to Soul Formation wasn't too far away.Han Jue opened his eyes.In these ten years, Yang Tiandong's cultivation had reached the sixth level of the Foundation Establishment realm.Six levels in ten years.He was pretty fast.He was indeed a genius!Han Jue called him, \"Tiandong.\"Yang Tiandong suddenly woke up and hurriedly kowtowed to him.\"How have you felt these ten years?\" Han Jue asked.Yang Tiandong replied, \"I've benefited greatly. Not only did my cultivation level increase, but I've also made sense of many principles.\"My goodness!It's been ten years!Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comYang Tiandong wailed in his head.In these ten years, he had become hopeless countless times.However, he felt that this was Han Jue's test for him, and he could not relax.If he couldn't even pass the first stage, Han Jue would definitely not treat him as his disciple.Han Jue raised his eyebrows.He made sense of many principles?Bullsh*t!I've been in seclusion for more than a hundred years, but I haven't made sense of anything.Han Jue felt that there was a need for Yang Tiandong to gain more experience. He said, \"Go out and do some missions. I remember that the sect mission building has a monthly contribution list. You can come back when you become the first on the list.\"Yang Tiandong immediately stood up.When he got up, he nearly went down again.After sitting for ten years, his lower body had stiffened.He quickly bowed and left.Han Jue waved his hand and opened the door.After Yang Tiandong left, Han Jue pondered for a moment before taking out the Divine Cognition Pills he obtained from killing Duan Tongtian.The pills were used to enhance divine sense.After strengthening his divine sense, he could try to break into the crimson feather that Yang Tiandong had given him.There were nine pills in the bottle. Han Jue took out one immediately.After taking the Divine Cognition Pill, Han Jue immediately felt dizzy.Some time passed.When he woke up, he discovered that his divine sense had doubled in strength.He was pleasantly surprised.This pill is quite powerful!Han Jue began taking the pill regularly.Half a month later.All nine Divine Cognition Pills were consumed. The effects were outstanding. His divine sense soared.It was more than ten times stronger!The more pills one consumed, the stronger the effect.

When mastered, one could have a ten-thousand-meter tall body!Han Jue was pleasantly surprised. He liked the grandness and magnificence of the mystical power.\u2026In the mountains, a group of cultivators was hurrying on their way.The one walking in front was Mo Fuchou.Mo Fuchou had reached the Golden Core realm and had become a true core disciple.Other than him and two other male disciples, the rest were all young men and women.\"Is Jade Pure Sect up ahead?\"\"Haiz, will I fail the selection test!?\"\"It's normal to fail.

Mo Fuchou subconsciously drew his sword and slashed the air with it, shattering a bamboo arrow. Immediately after, the bamboo arrow fragments turned into a poisonous mist that spread in all directions.\"Retreat, we ran into enemies!\" Mo Fuchou said in a deep voice, then jumped up and swung his sword at the attacker.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comIt was a man in a straw raincoat, and his straw hat concealed his face.

When they saw that Mo Fuchou had been severely injured, all of them panicked!\"Everyone, kneel. We only want to capture Mo Fuchou.

I'll leave them to you.\"Leaving these words behind, Han Jue then left.Li Qingzi was stunned for a moment before he slowly looked at the two men on the floor.On the other side.Han Jue returned to his cave abode, sat down on the wooden bed, and stretched.\"If they dared to capture people right outside our sect, they must be our new enemy. Since they appeared after the Viridescent Nether Cult's demise, they must be stronger.\"Han Jue thought silently.\"Sigh!\"Endless trouble. Is this life?I need to break through to the Soul Formation realm as soon as possible!Han Jue suddenly felt that being at the Nascent Soul realm wasn't that safe, after all.Updated from lightnovelworld.comThe next morning.Li Qingzi and the Great Grand Elder came looking for him.Han Jue opened the cave entrance and let them in.\"Tsk tsk, the spiritual aura here is almost comparable to Main Peak's herbal garden.\" The Great Grand Elder clicked his tongue in wonder.Facing Han Jue again, he was still a little embarrassed.After all, decades ago, he was demoralized by him. Now that he had picked up the mystical power again, he still felt somewhat uncomfortable meeting Han Jue.Li Qingzi smiled. \"The cave abode is still a little small. Should we ask someone to make it bigger?\"Han Jue shook his head and said, \"It's good enough. It would seem too empty if it was bigger.\"If the Sect Master and the ex-Sect Master came at the same time, there must be some big trouble.\"Just say it. Are we in trouble again?\" Han Jue asked.It must be because of the two men I caught yesterday.Li Qingzi sighed and said, \"Those two men are from the Raincoat Sect. We have been established for almost a thousand years, while the Raincoat Sect has already existed for thousands of years. Their whereabouts are mysterious. A thousand years ago, they tried to conquer the entire Great Yan cultivation world. But they were defeated by a union of orthodox sects. After that, they hid in the darkness. Now they are back again. Recently, they captured a few of our talented disciples. They seem to have a lot of information about us as they know very well who their targets are.\"Great Grand Elder harrumphed. \"There must be a spy. The spies from the Viridescent Nether Cult are yet to be eliminated. Most concerning are the spies hidden among the elders. I suspect that they went to find the Raincoat Sect to help them seek revenge.\"Raincoat Sect?What an interesting name.Han Jue asked, \"Are there Soul Formation or Void Amalgamation realm cultivators in this Raincoat Sect?\"Li Qingzi replied, \"There are definitely Soul Formation realm cultivators, but I'm not sure about Void Amalgamation realm cultivators.\"\"Oh.\"Han Jue suddenly wanted to run away again.Of course, it was just a thought. Where could he run to?The Great Grand Elder said, \"We plan to pay a personal visit to each sect and unite all the orthodox sects together. During this period of time, we hope you can protect the Jade Pure Sect.\"[You face the request of the Jade Pure Sect's Sect Master and Great Grand Elder. You have the following choices:]It had been a long time since Han Jue had to make a choice.There are more rewards for the second option!There are also Soul Formation realm cultivation pills!\"No problem!\" Han Jue agreed readily.As long as he was not asked to go out, anything was fine.Li Qingzi and the Great Grand Elder were pleasantly surprised. Their favorability towards Han Jue increased once again, both reaching a 4-star favorability.After the two of them left, Han Jue immediately entered his cultivation state.It's too dangerous!New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.comI need to hurry up my cultivation!Han Jue thought silently.Although he could already absorb six types of Spirit Qi at the same time, it would still take him decades to reach the Soul Formation realm.A few decades! That's the lifespan of mere mortals!\u2026In the blink of an eye, six years had passed.Han Jue broke through to the fifth level of the Nascent Soul realm, and his lifespan increased to 1,080 years!I like this progression!Han Jue was very satisfied.He suddenly remembered something.Why wasn't his disciple Yang Tiandong back yet?He opened his interpersonal link and noticed the flashing red banners on his mailbox.He clicked on them to check.[Your good friend, Li Qingzi, has been attacked by the Raincoat Sect] x14[Your good friend, Great Grand Elder, was attacked by the Raincoat Sect] x26[Your disciple, Yang Tiandong, has been attacked by the Raincoat Sect][Your disciple, Yang Tiandong, has been captured by the Raincoat Sect][Your friend, Zhou Fan, has been attacked by the Raincoat Sect] x8\u2026It was a long list of attacks from the Raincoat Sect.It looked even direr than when they faced the Viridescent Nether Cult.Han Jue noticed that his disciple was caught.Logically speaking, as the master, he should come out of seclusion.No!Han Jue felt that this was a trap.

The interpersonal relationships didn't indicate that she was a spy.Arriving in front of the Jade Serene Hall, the door opened quickly and Han Jue immediately entered.This time, he didn't kowtow. Instead, he clasped his hands and bowed.\"Master, I discovered an elder who works for the Raincoat Sect. What should I do?

Next were the deacons.There were spies from everywhere among the deacons.Apart from the Raincoat Sect, there were spies from all sorts of sects, whether they were orthodox or fiendish. There were even some from cultivation families. Han Jue was flabbergasted.Are all sects in the cultivation world like this? Or are we just unlucky?Han Jue shook his head.There were too many for him to pursue the matter. After all, these deacons couldn't do much to harm the sect.Han Jue began to cultivate.After that, every half a year, he would use the Simulation Trial system to detect the strongest person in the Jade Pure Sect, in case the Raincoat Sect suddenly launched an attack.Two years later.A notification suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue's cultivating figure.[Detected bearer of connate providence, checking its origin.]Again?Han Jue immediately checked.A row of words appeared in front of him:[Black Hell Chicken: Reincarnated Demon Saint of the Upper World. Its true form is a Black Hell Phoenix. Because it killed too many people, it offended the Heavenly Court and was executed.

Does this world also have one?Intrigued by the Black Hell Chicken, Han Jue immediately reached out with his divine sense.At the foot of the mountain, an old farmer was leading a herd of cows through the mountains. On the back of each cow were two chicken cages filled with chickens. Han Jue's divine sense quickly landed on one of the little black chickens. The feathers of this black chicken were shiny and had a metallic feel to them.Amongst the group of chicks, only this little black chicken had a faint spirit energy fluctuation.How could he miss out on an unparalleled divine pet?Han Jue immediately went down the mountain.He approached the old farmer and immediately asked for the chick.The old farmer didn't dare to refuse. He was a servant of the Jade Pure Sect and this batch of cows and chicks was meant to be given to the inner sect.

However, it was sent flying by his Six Paths spirit energy and crashed into the wall. It cried out in pain.That was close!I almost killed it!Han Jue had no choice but to pour his spirit energy into the Black Hell Chicken to guide it to absorb Spirit Qi.After several days, the Black Hell Chicken finally got used to it.Absorbing Spirit Qi could alleviate hunger. So, the Black Hell Chicken began enjoying cultivation.Needless to say, the reincarnation of a demon saint was indeed impressive.Although it had yet to complete its transformation and its intelligence had not matured, its instincts were still there.If it didn't meet Han Jue, the Black Hell Chicken would have been sent to the Ten Thousand Demon Realm, eaten by other demon beasts, and reincarnated again. It was unknown how many lifetimes it would take for it to regain the grace of a demon saint.After the Black Hell Chicken started cultivating, Han Jue was relieved and continued cultivating.The fifth level of the Nascent Soul realm was far from enough for him.His goal was to reach the Soul Formation realm as soon as possible.No.I have to reach the Void Amalgamation realm soon!Or rather, the Mahayana realm!I need to reach the highest cultivation level in the mortal world.

She turned around and saw Han Jue smiling, and she felt a surge of sweetness in her heart.It seemed that her husband was very happy about her arrival.Han Jue started to chat with her.Xing Hongxuan told him the story of how she went out to train, and Han Jue also learned about the cultivation world.Last month, she went out to train with her seniors from the same peak. Coincidentally, she came across a battle between an orthodox sect, the Crimson Peak Sect, and a demonic path sect, Azure Dragon Sect. They helped fend off the cultivators from Azure Dragon Sect and Xing Hongxuan obtained a storage ring by chance. She later discovered that there were many treasures in it.\"What rank is the Jade Pure Sect in the cultivation world of Great Yan?\" Han Jue asked.Xing Hongxuan said in a low voice, \"There are more than twenty sects in the Great Yan Cultivation World, including twelve orthodox sects. Jade Pure Sect should be among the top five.\"Eh?Only the top five?Han Jue was disappointed. No wonder we have so many enemies.Xing Hongxuan shook her head and smiled. \"Actually, most sects don't have much of a difference in strength. They don't have a true ranking.\"Han Jue nodded.There were not that many rankings in the real Cultivation world. After all, there was no big data supporting it.Xing Hongxuan seemed to recall something and continued, \"Oh, right. Recently, a controversial figure has appeared in the cultivation world\u2014Huang Jihao, from the Vermilion Bird Sword Sect. Back when he was at the Golden Core realm, he once killed an old Nascent Soul realm monster. He then became very famous. It has been a few hundred years, and his strength has probably reached the Soul Formation realm. Recently, he single-handedly fought his way into an orthodox sect, and no one could stop him.\"She frowned slightly and said, \"I heard that Huang Jihao wants to challenge all the sects in the Great Yan Cultivation World.

His tiny Nascent Soul trembled.Han Jue placed him on the ground and sat on the bed, looking down at him.\"What's the Raincoat Sect's intention?\" Han Jue asked.Ye Sanlang gritted his teeth as he replied, \"Annex the Jade Pure Sect and capture their geniuses together.

The spirit stones piled up into small hills. There were various equipment, cultivation technique manuals, medicinal pills, and many other treasures.Han Jue first looked at the cultivation technique manuals. They were all cultivation techniques and spell techniques. He didn't like them.As for equipment, they were only used by fiendish cultivators.Han Jue started to check the pills.Soon, he discovered a pill that could increase his cultivation level to the Nascent Soul Realm. Six Paths spirit energy entered the pill and he felt a surging Spirit Qi emanating from it.Han Jue immediately started to consume it.\u2026Two years later.Han Jue broke through to the sixth level of the Nascent Soul realm.The Black Hell Chicken had already become a majestic rooster. Its intelligence had also finally reached the level of a seven or eight-year-old child. It could speak in the human language now.It was worth mentioning that when the Black Hell Chicken cultivated a trace of demonic power. It actually inherited a demonic cultivation technique. It was very surprised.Han Jue understood that this was the cultivation technique of the Demon Saint in his previous life.That was good, too. Han Jue didn't need to teach it too much.Li Qingzi came to visit him again and talked about the Raincoat Sect.Recently, the Raincoat Sect seemed to have vanished and no longer targeted the Jade Pure Sect. Li Qingzi finally found out the location where the geniuses of the Jade Pure Sect were imprisoned.He wanted to ask Han Jue for help.Han Jue said seriously, \"Perhaps this is a ploy to lure me away from the sect. Once I leave, if the Raincoat Sect comes, can you stop them?

It was still far from maturing.One fine day, Chang Yue'er came to visit.It had been many years since she had last seen the Black Hell Chicken.

It was Guan Yougang.Guan Yougang didn't dare to challenge the Deity Slaying Elder, so he gave up on becoming the Sect Master. However, he couldn't take it lying down, so he looked for Li Qingzi to spar and took the opportunity to vent.The elders of the sect were extremely displeased with him due to this.The Jade Pure Sect was in danger now, but he was still causing trouble.

Kill your way out and destroy the Raincoat Sect with me!\"Zhou Fan and Yang Tiandong were overjoyed.They were finally here!\u2026A year passed in the blink of an eye after breaking through to the Soul Formation realm.Han Jue was still in seclusion.Occasionally, he would pay attention to the emails. By the looks of things, the Jade Pure Sect and the Raincoat Sect were at war.Guan Yougang and Li Qingzi were heavily injured again. It was truly tragic.His disciple, Yang Tiandong, had also been attacked by the Raincoat Sect. It seemed that he had already joined the main force, which was why he had been able to keep fighting.Han Jue could only cheer for them in his heart.He had an even more important duty, which was to protect the Jade Pure Sect.Now, Han Jue was not worried about the Raincoat Sect launching a sneak attack on the Jade Pure Sect. Instead, he was worried about enemies far away.What was worth mentioning was that the cultivation of the Black Hell Chicken was already equivalent to a Foundation Establishment Realm cultivator. Its cultivation speed was getting faster and faster.It was lying in a corner like an elephant. Its feathers were extremely magnificent. Although it was a chicken, it had the aura of a divine pheasant.When Han Jue sized up the Black Hell Chicken in satisfaction, Xuan Qingjun suddenly came to visit.Seeing her again, Han Jue's expression was very unnatural.Although Xuan Qingjun was only at the Foundation Establishment realm, there was a Mahayana Demon Lord hidden in her soul that he could not offend.\"I heard that our Deity Slaying Elder broke through in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm?\" Xuan Qingjun sat beside him and asked with a smile.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comFor the past year, there had been rumors that a mighty figure had transcended the tribulation in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm.

He pretended to be calm and asked, \"Why are you looking for me?\"Was she going to start\u2026Oh, his virginity\u2026Han Jue panicked.\"I'm leaving. I came to say goodbye.\" Xuan Qingjun smiled.Han Jue was stunned.Leaving?Xuan Qingjun asked, \"What do you want before I leave? I'll try my best to satisfy you. I don't know how long it'll be before we meet again.\"Han Jue asked in surprise, \"You're leaving just like that? You're not going to\u2026\"Xuan Qingjun rolled her eyes at him and snorted. \"You seem excited for it, keep dreaming. I need you, but not now. Don't think that I'll stay with you every day. It's not time yet.\"That's good! Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.He almost lost his virginity.He muttered, \"Are there any pills that can increase the cultivation of Soul Formation Realm cultivators?\"Xuan Qingjun immediately took out four pill bottles from her sleeve. \"These are Soul Formation Spirit Enhancing Pills. I only have these four bottles on me. I'll give them all to you.\"Han Jue thanked her hurriedly.Xuan Qingjun reached out and used her finger to lift his chin. She smiled and said, \"I won't be able to bear not seeing your face for many years. However, it's inconvenient for me to bring you along. In the future, you should stay in the Jade Pure Sect and cultivate well. Don't run around. The cultivation world is very dangerous. Although you're already at the Soul Formation realm, you're not invincible.\"Han Jue nodded unnaturally.Xuan Qingjun teased him and left.Han Jue wiped the cold sweat on his forehead.The pressure the Demon Lord gave him was truly great.It seemed that the Demon Lord was really only passing by the Jade Pure Sect and did not have any ulterior motives. She was probably going to other places to comprehend the Dao and experience the myriad forms of life.Sigh, my damned unparalleled charm. Even the Demon Lord couldn't resist it.But then again\u2026How fragrant!Han Li looked at the four bottles of Soul Formation Stage Spirit Enhancing Pills beside him in joy.After Xuan Qingjun left, the Black Hell Chicken said excitedly, \"Congratulations, Master. You don't have to worry about being eaten by her anymore!\"Han Jue couldn't be bothered with it and continued practicing.He wanted to master the fifth level of the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique first before taking pills to strengthen his cultivation.Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Will that do?\"\"Sect Master is wise!\"The elders laughed, but their smiles were helpless.If the Sect Master went, he would probably stall for time.\u2026Several months later.Han Jue had mastered the fifth level of the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique and comprehended a new Mystical Power.More accurately, it was the advanced version of Six Paths Soul Absorption.He could absorb souls and store them in the depths of his essence soul. This move could protect the soul and also confine it.In addition, he could also leave a Six Paths Insignia.The Six Paths Insignia would exist forever. No matter how many times the other party reincarnated, it would still remain. It was equivalent to crossing the reincarnation cycle to find the other party.That was good.If he met someone he cared about in the future, he could leave behind the Six Paths Insignia and meet them in their next life.The higher his cultivation realm, the more domineering the Six Paths spirit energy became.He took out the pills and continued cultivating.The first level of the Soul Formation Realm was not enough!He wanted to be stronger!His next target was the Void Amalgamation Realm.Han Jue no longer cared about the Raincoat Sect. He was worried about the Demon Taming Sect.He didn't forget about Xiao'e. This guy's image was still in his interpersonal relationships. He was still as ugly as ever. His hatred was still so great that he wouldn't rest until he was dead.The key was that Xiao'e was not the sect master. That was ridiculous.How powerful was the Demon Taming Sect?While Han Jue was worried, Chang Yue'er came to visit.To be precise, Fairy Xi Xuan invited her.Fairy Xi Xuan rarely invited Han Jue, so Han Jue naturally had to give her face.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comHe immediately went forward.When he arrived at the Jade Serene Hall, most of the disciples were present. The eldest disciple, Liu Sanxin, had already finished his apprenticeship and became a core disciple. The current eldest disciple was the seventh senior from back then, Meng He.When Meng He saw Han Jue again, he was a little embarrassed, but he still bowed respectfully.Under his command, the other disciples followed suit.The disciples were puzzled but quickly guessed the truth.There were rumors that Deity Slaying Elder came from Jade Serene Peak. He was extremely handsome and unparalleled.Could it be this person?They secretly sized him up. They couldn't help but be stunned by Han Jue's appearance.What a handsome man!It was definitely him!All the disciples looked at Han Jue with admiration.Chang Yue'er stood in front of him very proudly. She even wanted to hold Han Jue's arm, but he cleverly avoided her.Meng He instructed all the disciples not to reveal Han Jue's identity. The disciples promised.Soon, Fairy Xi Xuan arrived, and all the disciples sat down.Han Jue was still sitting at the back.\"Elder Han, come sit beside me,\" Fairy Xi Xuan said. With a wave of her right hand, a meditation cushion appeared beside her.Han Jue hesitated for a moment before walking over.He sat beside Fairy Xi Xuan in puzzlement.What's Master trying to do?Is she going to pass her position to me?No way!It's too troublesome to manage Jade Serene Peak!Han Jue thought worriedly.\"The Sect Master has sent a message back. He said that they have already met up with the Vermillion Bird Sword Sect and are currently attacking the Raincoat Sect. The imprisoned disciples have also been rescued, but he's worried that the Raincoat Sect will attack us because they only encountered five Soul Formation experts. The other five must have other arrangements. For the time being, I hope that everyone will leave seclusion and patrol the inner and outer parts of the sect.\"Fairy Xi Xuan spoke with a solemn expression.\"Among the disciples of the eighteen peaks, our Jade Serene Peak contributed the least. Other than us, it's also because of the Sect Master's favoritism towards us. Do you understand?\"Her voice was very soft, but it made all the disciples feel a surge of strength.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comEveryone's spirit was ignited!After cultivating for so many years, it was time to draw their sword!Han Jue nodded slightly. He wasn't as excited as the disciples.Fairy Xi Xuan glanced at him and asked, \"Elder Han, are you confident in dealing with the Soul Formation Stage cultivator from the Raincoat Sect?\"The disciples quietened down and looked at Han Jue expectantly.Soul Formation was too far away for the disciples.If they were really sent to deal with Soul Formation Stage cultivators, wouldn't that be suicide?Not even their master, Fairy Xi Xuan, could do it!Han Jue took in their expressions and finally understood why Fairy Xi Xuan looked for him.So it was to calm them down.Sigh, I only wanted to cultivate in secret, but the sect keeps getting beaten up.After thinking about it, Han Jue said, \"I have experience dealing with Soul Formation cultivators.\"He spoke very humbly, but to the disciples, it was domineering!The elder before them had killed a Soul Formation cultivator before!It was said that it was an insta-kill!The disciples cheered and showed their respect for Han Jue.\"Alright, you can go and prepare. This matter will be arranged by your Eldest Senior Brother. Also, regarding the Deity Slaying Elder's identity, you're not to spread it. Only the Jade Serene Peak knows about this\u2026\" Fairy Xi Xuan instructed.The disciples bowed and left.Soon, only Han Jue and Fairy Xi Xuan were left in the Jade Serene Hall.Fairy Xi Xuan tilted her head and looked at him. She asked softly, \"Which level are you at?\"Stunned, Han Jue asked curiously, \"What level?\"\"Cultivation level.\"\"Oh, first level.\"\"Why are you still at the first level?\"Fairy Xi Xuan frowned. After being in seclusion for so many years, even with Han Jue's absurd aptitude, he couldn't improve much?Han Jue coughed and said, \"First level of the Soul Formation realm.\"Did Li Qingzi not tell her that he was about to break through?For more, visit lightnovelworld.comFairy Xi Xuan was stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Looks like you no longer treat me as your master. After all, as your master, I've never taught you anything.\" Fairy Xi Xuan snorted.Han Jue shrugged and said, \"You asked too suddenly. I didn't take a detour. Besides, I asked you before for a suitable location to undergo tribulation.\"Fairy Xi Xuan shook her head and laughed. How could she have thought that Han Jue would break through to the Soul Formation realm so quickly? How many years had it been since he entered the Nascent Soul realm?Then, she continued to ask, \"If you have any needs, feel free to ask. You have done more for the sect than the sect has done for you. There's no need to be polite.\"Needs?Han Jue thought for a moment.\"Is there a cultivation pill for the Soul Formation realm?\"\"No\u2026\"\"Then try your best to help me strengthen the Spirit Qi in the cave abode.\"\"Yes, I'll think of something.\"Han Jue had his own cultivation technique and spell inheritance, so he didn't need the teachings of the Jade Pure Sect.The reason why he had stayed in the sect was that he had no other good place to go. Instead of wandering around, it was better to cultivate here in peace.After a short conversation, Han Jue got up and left.Fairy Xi Xuan looked at his back and asked, \"How long can you stay in the Jade Pure Sect?\"Han Jue stopped and turned to look at her. \"Why do you ask? If I wanted to run, I would have run away long ago.\"Fairy Xi Xuan shook her head and said, \"I'm not afraid that you'll run away. It's just that you've grown too quickly. When the time comes, this small temple won't be able to hold a giant Buddha like you. There are many sects more powerful than the Jade Pure Sect in the cultivation world. It is in man's nature to strive for better, especially for ascetics like you. Back then, the founding ancestor left the Great Yan to pursue a higher realm.\"She sighed as she thought of that.Han Jue smiled and said, \"Perhaps. If I really want to leave one day, I will tell you in advance.\"With that, he turned around and left.To seek the Great Dao in a wider world?Nonsense!He'd rather be the peak of this world than the bottom-feeder of a higher realm!In any case, his potential was top-notch. If he cultivated in peace, he could constantly become stronger. Why would he need to go out and adventure?\u2026After returning to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue began to meditate.The Black Hell Chicken suddenly said, \"Master, I heard the cries of the chickens from the foot of the mountain. When I heard their voices, my heart inexplicably throbbed. I wanted to rush out. Why? Could it be the demonic technique you spoke of?\"This content is taken from lightnovelworld.comHan Jue raised his eyebrows and said, \"Yes, you must restrain this urge.

The path of cultivation is truly fraught with danger!\" The Black Hell Chicken lamented.Han Jue secretly laughed.Even I'm still a virgin, you can forget about having fun!Just be a child\u2026 forever!Immediately, Han Jue and the Black Hell Chicken entered cultivation.When he was free, Han Jue would instill his ideas into the Black Hell Chicken.Everything was inferior, only cultivation was superior.Cultivators were all superior!A cultivating chicken was a superior chicken among chickens!\u2026In the blink of an eye, two years passed.Han Jue had yet to break through to the second level of the Soul Formation Realm, but by relying on the pills, he was already approaching it.He did not stop. Instead, he continued to cultivate and strive to break through as soon as possible.One fine day, the Raincoat Sect was finally here!It was Sect Master Huang Zuntian and an accompanying elder.This elder was known as Spiritual Master Shan Kui, and he was also in the Soul Formation realm.Huang Zuntian landed on the top of the mountain and looked warily at the eighteen peaks of the Jade Pure Sect.Spiritual Master Shan Kui wore a raincoat. Under the brim of his hat, his eyes were extremely cold and contained killing intent.\"Sect Master, attack!\" Spiritual Master Shan Kui said with disdain.This is the Jade Pure Sect?So weak!Not even a single Soul Formation expert is present!There were less than ten Nascent Soul experts left.

Therefore, it also fattened the Chaotic Heavenly Dog.Han Jue didn't stop it.Plump pets were the cutest. His cultivation level far exceeded the Chaotic Heavenly Dog.

He originally had a lot to say, but seeing that his master did not want to listen, he could only obediently walk to the side and start cultivating.The Chaotic Heavenly Dog stared at him and whispered, \"Brother Chicken, his aura is so irritating.\"The Black Hell Chicken narrowed its eyes. \"Yes, I feel the same.\"Although their voices were low, Yang Tiandong could hear them clearly.He was speechless.Was his half-demon bloodline so irritating to demons?Yang Tiandong felt wronged, but he didn't dare to say anything.After a while, Han Jue opened his eyes and thought, \"Is this the Void Amalgamation Realm? Not bad!\"He had lost!With the Wind God Technique and the Somersault Cloud, he barely lasted for a few minutes.It was still very difficult for a cultivator at the third level of the Soul Formation Realm to fight a cultivator at the eighth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm.Han Jue took a deep breath.He had a goal.He wanted to defeat Daoist Nine Cauldrons as soon as possible!For the next period of time, the entire Jade Pure Sect was very lively. Firstly, the Millennium Ceremony was coming. Secondly, the founder had returned!The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comUnder the publicity of the elders of the 18 peaks, all sorts of legends about Daoist Nine Cauldrons spread.A cultivator who had lived for more than a thousand years was extremely rare in the entire cultivation world of the Great Yan.Han Jue was still in seclusion and did not go out.Several days later, Li Qingzi came to visit.Daoist Nine Cauldrons followed.He was tall and had a head full of white hair. He had the bearing of an immortal.Han Jue stood up and bowed.Yang Tiandong followed suit.The Black Hell Chicken and Chaotic Heavenly Dog sprawled on the ground as they quietly looked at Daoist Nine Cauldrons.After Daoist Nine Cauldrons entered the cave abode, he first looked at the Black Hell Chicken and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog and then said in surprise, \"These two beasts are not simple. Young friend, where did you get them?\"The others of the Jade Pure Sect could not see the origins of the two beasts, but Daoist Nine Cauldrons could sense that they were extraordinary. After all, he had traveled the world and was very knowledgeable.Li Qingzi couldn't help but turn around. Since when was there a dog?Han Jue smiled and said, \"I got them by chance.\"Daoist Nine Cauldrons smiled and didn't ask further. He walked to a chair and sat down. He looked at Han Jue and said, \"Young friend, it's all thanks to you that the Jade Pure Sect was able to survive. Otherwise, the sect would have been destroyed. I came especially to thank you and also brought an opportunity.\"Opportunity?Han Jue frowned.In his understanding, as long as it was not something directly given to him, it was a risk.Danger!It was easy to get into trouble!\"I left the Great Yan Cultivation World a thousand years ago to seek the land of immortals. After that, I went overseas and lived in the mortal world. Now, I'm already the vice sect master of a sect. This time, I'll bring some geniuses to cultivate there. When their cultivation reaches a phenomenal stage, they can return to the Jade Pure Sect. Are you willing to go?\" Daoist Nine Cauldrons stroked his beard and smiled.Overseas vice sect master?Han Jue was speechless.Your hometown was almost gone, but you went to join someone else's sect and made a name for yourself.Han Jue asked cautiously, \"Is your sect invincible overseas?\"\"It's difficult to be invincible, but it's still one of the overlords.\"\"Overlord? Are there enemies?\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experience\"Of course, but there's nothing to be afraid of. It's very difficult to overturn our sect. There are many Void Amalgamation Realm experts in our sect.\"\"Oh, thank you for your kind intentions, ancestor. I won't be going.\"Han Jue shook his head and rejected.The outside was so dangerous. If they weren't an invincible sect, they would definitely face danger.In the Great Yan, the Jade Pure Sect no longer had any enemies.The strongest Raincoat Sect was about to fall!Daoist Nine Cauldrons smiled. \"They said that you are very cautious. It seems that you are afraid that it will be dangerous to go overseas? That's true. Back then, I\u2026\"He began to brag about his adventures. Indeed, no matter what world it was, old men were always talkative and loved to brag.Han Jue listened quietly.After Daoist Nine Cauldrons spoke for a long time, Li Qingzi finally had a chance to speak.\"Elder Han, it's fine if you don't want to go. It's also good to stay in the Jade Pure Sect. Next, the ancestor will help our sect develop. At that time, the Jade Pure Sect will definitely become the overlord of the Great Yan Cultivation World. You want to cultivate diligently, right? No problem. I'll try my best to help you search for natural treasures. From now on, the entire mountain will be yours. I can expel the disciples from the other Cave Abodes and leave them for you and your disciples in the future.\" Li Qingzi smiled.He was the Sect Master and naturally didn't want Han Jue to leave.Daoist Nine Cauldrons had put it nicely. How could the geniuses be willing to return from a better sect?Of course, this was unless they were not doing well and were often oppressed.If Han Jue left with him, what would happen if the Jade Pure Sect encountered danger again?Daoist Nine Cauldrons smiled and said, \"That's right. I'll stay for at least fifty years before leaving. I'll first reform the Jade Pure Sect and turn it into the Holy Land of the Great Yan Cultivation World. During this time, you can consider it.\"A line of words appeared in front of Han Jue.[You are invited by Daoist Nine Cauldrons and Li Qingzi. You have the following choices:][1: Follow Daoist Nine Cauldrons and go overseas. You can obtain a bottle of cultivation pills, equipment, and a Numinous Treasure.][2: Continue to stay in the Jade Pure Sect. Cultivate while keeping a low profile and strive for stability. You can obtain a Mystical Power inheritance.]Han Jue smiled and said, \"Thank you, Ancestor and Sect Master. I'll stay in the Jade Pure Sect first.\"He silently chose the second option.In terms of choices, the first option may be better, unlike in the past.But he thought about it. There was no need for him to go overseas.Perhaps the Spirit Qi here was far inferior, but he had no enemies and could cultivate peacefully.If he went overseas, he might encounter many troubles.New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.comHan Jue didn't have any blood feuds or terrifying enemies. Why would he want to go out?In addition, Li Qingzi's suggestion was also good. This Cave Abode was indeed small and the entire mountain was just right for him.As for the other disciples on the mountain, Han Jue could only apologize.He believed that Li Qingzi could weigh the pros and cons.[You choose to stay in the Jade Pure Sect. Obtained a Mystical Power inheritance.][Congratulations on obtaining the Mystical Power\u2014Tathagata Incantation][Tathagata Incantation: Buddhist Mystical Power. It can vanquish ghosts and suppress evil spirits.]Buddhist Mystical Power?Interesting!Han Jue thought silently.The three of them continued to chat.Less than three days after Li Qingzi and Daoist Nine Cauldrons left, all the other cultivators on the mountain moved out.Under Li Qingzi's arrangements, a group of mortal servants came to plant the treasures.This batch of treasures was likely brought back by Daoist Nine Cauldrons. Their quality clearly exceeded the previous ones.Not only that, Li Qingzi even personally came to the foot of the mountain to set up a formation for Han Jue.The treatment was as good as it got!When this matter reached the inner sect, the disciples thought that the Sect Master wanted to nurture a cultivation holy mountain. All of them began to look forward to it.Little did they know that this mountain only belonged to one person.Han Jue didn't interfere with the matters outside the Cave Abode and cultivated in peace.The Black Hell Chicken and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog were also cultivating diligently.Soon, Yang Tiandong left the Cave Abode.Li Qingzi intended to nurture him and let him take over the Jade Pure Sect. Firstly, it was because of his potential, and secondly, it was to rope Han Jue in.Half a year passed quickly.On this day, Xing Hongxuan came to find Han Jue.The disciples of the various peaks had been ordered not to come to this mountain. However, Xing Hongxuan had Daoist Jingxu's support, so she dared to come.Han Jue let her in.This content is taken from lightnovelworld.com\"Husband, I picked up a treasure recently and specially came to give it to you.\" Xing Hongxuan happily sat down next to Han Jue and took out a jade pearl the size of a baby's fist.After Han Jue took the bead and scanned it with his divine sense, his expression immediately turned strange.Xing Hongxuan said excitedly, \"This pearl can automatically gather the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth and create Qi Gathering Pills automatically. This is a good treasure!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The reason was that his divine sense discovered a soul hidden in the jade pearl.This soul was a fierce spirit filled with a malevolent aura.It was obviously not a good thing!Han Jue asked, \"Where did you find this pearl?\"After he explained the situation of the ferocious spirit in the jade pearl, Xing Hongxuan's eyes widened in disbelief.After that, she frowned and said in a low voice, \"I obtained it in a cultivation market. I participated in the auction and obtained a treasure. However, someone targeted me. He followed me and wanted to seize my treasure. In the end, he was killed by me and I received this item from his storage ring. The fellow Daoist who accompanied me told me that this is a Connate Spirit Gathering Jade, and it's extremely rare. It's a cultivation sacred treasure. I heard that it was so amazing, so I brought it over to you.\"Han Jue felt that something was amiss.But he couldn't figure it out.He immediately used the Six Paths Soul Absorption Technique and eliminated the ferocious spirit inside. Then, he returned the Connate Spirit Gathering Jade to her.\"Take it. I've already gotten rid of the evil spirit inside. This treasure won't be of much help to me. You, on the other hand, are about to break through to the Golden Core Realm. You just happen to need this treasure,\" Han Jue said seriously.Xing Hongxuan subconsciously wanted to reject him, but Han Jue continued, \"Your cultivation is too slow. At this rate, the possibility of me becoming your husband will decrease. You should be thinking of increasing your cultivation speed.\"Xing Hongxuan's smile turned bitter.Han Jue couldn't bear to watch this. After all, this was the woman who had the highest favorability towards him.With a flip of his right hand, he handed Xing Hongxuan the spirit pills that he had seized in the past.These pills could help her break through to the Golden Core Realm and help her increase her cultivation level.\"You were the one who gave me treasures in the past. I'll do the same to you now. Also, open a Cave Abode in the back mountain and cultivate,\" Han Jue said seriously.Xing Hongxuan was pleasantly surprised and smiled sweetly.When Han Jue saw this, he inexplicably panicked. He said seriously, \"We are not husband and wife yet. I hope that you will do your best to cultivate. Also, don't publicize our relationship. I have killed many powerful enemies for the Jade Pure Sect. Don't become the enemy's weakness to threaten me, understand?\"Xing Hongxuan nodded obediently.Hmph.Rascal.You still care about me.He said that he was afraid she would become his weakness, but he was actually worried about her safety.New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.comThe more Xing Hongxuan thought about it, the sweeter she felt.She recalled that back then, Han Jue was still a youth in her eyes. Now, he had become the powerful Deity Slaying Elder of the Jade Pure Sect.Such potential was unheard of in the cultivation world.She had to work hard.If this continued, she'd not be worthy of Han Jue.Xing Hongxuan didn't stay for long.She wanted to seize this opportunity to get closer to Han Jue, but the Black Hell Chicken and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog kept staring at her. Their eyes widened, making her feel embarrassed.\u2026A year and a half later.The Spirit Qi in the mountain where Han Jue was at increased greatly. Besides the Spirit Gathering Array, Li Qingzi also set up a protective array.Under Han Jue's instructions, Xing Hongxuan quietly moved to the back of the mountain and enjoyed the boundless Spirit Qi there.One fine day, the Jade Pure Sect's Millennium Ceremony was about to begin. All the righteous sects of the cultivation world sent people to congratulate them. The Jade Pure Sect welcomed an unprecedentedly lively event.It was said that the Sect Master of the Raincoat Sect vanished after heading to the Jade Pure Sect. In other words, it was very likely that he died there.This greatly elevated the Jade Pure Sect's status in the cultivation world. No one dared to slight them.After Daoist Nine Cauldrons returned, he began to personally clean up the sect. The Spirit Qi in the eighteen peaks and the inner sect cities also increased greatly. Although it wasn't as good as Han Jue's mountain, it was several times stronger than before.Not only that, but Daoist Nine Cauldrons also captured several great demons comparable to the Nascent Soul realm and imprisoned them in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm.The Jade Pure Sect was growing day by day.Han Jue wasn't interested in the Millennium Ceremony, so he did not attend and continued cultivating.What was worth mentioning was that as the Black Hell Chicken and Chaotic Heavenly Dog grew larger, the Cave Abode could no longer contain them. Han Jue chased them out half a year ago.They had to make their own cave on the mountain. At the same time, they were strictly forbidden from leaving the mountain's vicinity.The Black Hell Chicken had been instilled with values by Han Jue from a young age. Now, it was already a very timid\u2014no, a very cautious chicken. It often taught the Chaotic Heavenly Dog to have the same temperament as it.However, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog was naturally arrogant and despised it.Although the Chaotic Heavenly Dog did not respect it, the Black Hell Chicken still relied on its strength to forcefully control it.Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comNo matter what, this dog was hatched by it.In Han Jue's words, this was its son.One fine day, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue.[Detected bearer of Connate providence, checking its origin.]Another bearer of Connate providence?Han Jue already had an understanding of Connate providence. These were people with extraordinary fates.Some were jinxes, while some were children of destiny.A person with Connate providence was not absolutely powerful.Han Jue immediately chose to check the person's background.[Su Qi: The reincarnation of the jinx of the Heavenly Court. He was born with bad luck and would bring calamity to the people around him. He had an extremely overpowering destiny, and the people around him were often forced to death by bad luck, while he would always be able to turn the situation around for himself. When he heard that the Jade Pure Sect was the strongest sect in the cultivation world, he wanted to join it and learn an orthodox cultivation method. Special hint: Because you have the providence of the descendant of an Immortal Emperor, you are not affected by the jinx's bad luck. In addition, you are not allowed to kill the jinx. Otherwise, even your providence as the descendant of an Immortal Emperor cannot stop the overwhelming bad luck.]What the heck?Reincarnation of a jinx?Han Jue was speechless.Although his providence as a descendant of the Immortal Emperor could avoid the influence of the jinx, the Jade Pure Sect could not!Han Jue hurriedly scanned with his divine sense.Su Qi was walking towards the mountain.This was not good!Han Jue hesitated for a moment before deciding to meet this jinx.\u2026At the foot of the mountain, a youth sat on a large rock, panting and wiping the sweat from his forehead.Although he wasn't handsome, his eyes were filled with spirit.He turned to look at the eighteen peaks with blazing eyes.\"Why are you, a mortal, here?\" Han Jue's voice suddenly floated over.For more, visit lightnovelworld.comHe appeared in front of Su Qi.Su Qi shivered in fear and hurriedly knelt in front of Han Jue.Suppressing his excitement, he said, \"My name is Su Qi. I want to cultivate. I know the rules of cultivation sects, but I want to skip the outer sect and directly bring my talent into the inner sect of the Jade Pure Sect!\"How arrogant!Han Jue was speechless.Also, why did that sound so familiar?Han Jue shook his head and said, \"You're old enough. You missed the best cultivation time.\"For the sake of peace and stability in the future, Han Jue could only chase him away.\"Impossible, my talent is unparalleled!\"\"How about this, I'll teach you the Qi Gathering Technique. You can find another place to cultivate and not join the Jade Pure Sect.\"\"No, I have to join this sect. Are you not a member of the Jade Pure Sect? I heard that the sect is holding a Millennium Ceremony and is inviting all sects in the cultivation world.\"Su Qi looked at him warily.Han Jue was puzzled. How did this mortal know so many things?\"Are you really not leaving?\"\"No!\"\"Alright!\"Han Jue grabbed Su Qi and brought him back to the Connate Cave Abode.Su Qi was thrown to the ground on his butt, hurting it.Han Jue sat on the bed again and said, \"From today onwards, you can only stay here. You can forget about going out for the rest of your life!\"Since he was immune to Su Qi's bad luck, he was not afraid.As for why he did not kill him\u2026He couldn't stand the overwhelming bad luck himself!Han Jue was still worried that after killing Su Qi, this fellow would immediately regain his identity as an immortal of the Heavenly Court and find trouble with him.For more, visit lightnovelworld.comIt was better to be cautious!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What was the point of capturing him?Wait!Could it be that the expert of the sect was testing him?When Su Qi thought of this, he immediately calmed down.He immediately walked to the corner of the cave abode and imitated Han Jue.

Otherwise, he wouldn't be so daring!Su Qi made up his mind to cultivate well with Han Jue.The Millennium Ceremony passed very quickly.After the various sects left, the Jade Pure Sect did not calm down. Instead, it became even more lively.Daoist Nine Cauldrons and Li Qingzi modified the inner and outer sects and created more and more rules.In addition, Daoist Nine Cauldrons had also placed many good resources in the sect's treasure vault. There were cultivation techniques, spells, treasures, and so on.

He also didn't want to go overseas with Daoist Nine Cauldrons.During this period of time, the Jade Pure Sect recruited new disciples without restraint. The number of outer sect disciples increased greatly, but the number of inner sect disciples had yet to increase.The Jade Pure Sect only took in disciples from the mortals, so as to prevent any spies.Daoist Nine Cauldrons had not left for decades. This year, he left the sect with his core disciples.Chang Yue'er came to visit Han Jue and told him about this.\"The Raincoat Sect is finished. It's like a beaten dog now, hated by everyone!\" she said excitedly.The Chaotic Heavenly Dog nearly exploded when it heard that.It couldn't help but ask: \"What did you say about dogs?\"To prevent Chang Yue'er from meeting Su Qi and getting unlucky, Han Jue specially came out to see her.

As for the Deity Slaying Elder, other than Jade Serene Peak, most of the disciples had never seen him. He had always been very mysterious.Under such circumstances, the disciples worshiped the mysterious Deity Slaying Elder even more.After posturing, Daoist Nine Cauldrons left in satisfaction.Han Jue didn't think too much and continued cultivating.\u2026Time flew.Ten years passed quickly.While the Jade Pure Sect was growing rapidly, Han Jue had been cultivating silently.His cultivation level had broken through to the sixth level of the Soul Formation Realm.He used the simulation trial to fight Daoist Nine Cauldrons again.This time, he lasted for an hour.But he still lost!Han Jue sighed.Daoist Nine Cauldrons, who was at the eighth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm, was very strong.In a bad mood, Han Jue prepared to go out and wander around.He suddenly recalled that Daoist Nine Cauldrons had already come into contact with Su Qi. Would he encounter bad luck?He immediately opened the emails.[Your good friend Mo Fuchou was attacked by demons.][Your good friend Mo Zhu was attacked by demons.][Your good friend Daoist Nine Cauldrons encountered a mental demon during cultivation.][Your good friend Daoist Nine Cauldrons was attacked by a mental demon, reducing his cultivation by 100 years.][Your good friend Zhou Fan is dead. His soul was recalled by a mighty figure.

His mood improved and he got up to leave.Su Qi was still cultivating.Han Jue didn't teach him anything. He had been cultivating with the foundational Qi absorption technique until today and had never taken any Youth Retaining Pills. Now, he was already mature and was no longer the elegant youth from before.Xing Hongxuan went out a few years ago and had just returned less than three days ago. Han Jue decided to visit her.This was the first time Han Jue came to her cave abode.Xing Hongxuan was so excited that she stood up to welcome him.After the two of them entered the cave abode, Xing Hongxuan waved her hand and used the Formation Array to close the entrance.Han Jue sized up her cave abode. Although it was a cave abode, it had a unique charm. There were many paintings hanging on the wall, and the bed was a white jade boulder. It was spotlessly white.Xing Hongxuan immediately hugged his arm and pulled him to the table. She smiled and said, \"Husband, you came at the right time. A few years ago, I went to the Ancient Forbidden Ground and obtained quite a number of treasures there. You can take a look and see what you like.\"She waved her right hand and treasures appeared on the table.There were jades, equipment, natural treasures, and so on. They were all very small.Han Jue sat down and scanned them with his divine sense.He merely glanced at them.Although Xing Hongxuan was already a Golden Core Realm cultivator, what treasures could she find?\"Eh?\" Han Jue suddenly exclaimed.His gaze landed on a wooden tablet that looked like a memorial tablet.Xing Hongxuan noticed his expression and smiled smugly. \"How about it? If you like it, you can take it. Everything I have is also yours.\"Han Jue ignored her and picked up the wooden tablet.There were no words on it. It looked very ordinary.However, Han Jue could sense a faint spiritual will inside.It was very weak!Ordinary Soul Formation Realm cultivators might not even notice.Han Jue closed his eyes and probed with his divine sense.Boom\u2014A powerful divine sense broke through the spiritual will in the wooden token. Immediately after, a memory surged into Han Jue's mind.Xing Hongxuan raised her hands and looked at him.It had been a long time since she had seen him so close.For more, visit lightnovelworld.comWhy was this face so handsome?Xing Hongxuan was no longer young and often went out to train. She could be said to be experienced and knowledgeable.

Han Jue could create a puppet with the same cultivation level as him. The weakness was that the puppet didn't last long enough. After the spiritual energy was exhausted, the puppet would stop moving until the next time spiritual energy was poured in again.The Heavenly Puppet was not able to fight automatically. It required a trace of the user's soul thought to control. It was similar to a clone, but the destruction of the Heavenly Puppet would not affect the creator.Because there was no need for breathing, the Heavenly Puppet could be stored in his storage ring.This was a good secret technique.Han Jue could create some Heavenly Puppets for the people he wanted to protect.Han Jue immediately stood up and said, \"It's indeed a good treasure. I'll go back and cultivate first. I'll look for you again after some time!\"With that, he vanished.Xing Hongxuan was taken aback.Her expression turned bitter.However, on second thought, it must be a good treasure to make Han Jue so impatient.She felt happy again.He would definitely like her more now!\u2026After returning to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue immediately started creating the Heavenly Puppet.He mobilized his spiritual energy with both hands as if he was creating an invisible clay figure.He was pleasantly surprised to find that using the Six Paths spirit energy to create the Heavenly Puppet was not an obstacle.The inherited memories told him that the creation process of the Heavenly Puppet was very difficult. The difficulty was related to spiritual energy.Under normal circumstances, it was difficult for spiritual energy to materialize, let alone create puppets.However, according to the Heavenly Puppet secret technique, it was indeed possible. This was extremely miraculous.At the same time, the secret technique to create a soul thought was rather rare and could be used on other techniques.Soul thought was equivalent to having an extra pair of eyes.Han Jue planned to create some Heavenly Puppets for Xing Hongxuan, Chang Yue'er, and Fairy Xi Xuan.Oh.Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceOne for his disciple, Yang Tiandong, as well.The next time they encountered danger, his puppet would save their lives.However, Han Jue still underestimated the difficulty of making the Heavenly Puppet.It took a full year!Han Jue had only created one Heavenly Puppet. Although it was not difficult to create, it was too cumbersome and required a lot of time and effort.The newly formed Heavenly Puppet was already fully charged.This puppet was like a wooden puppet with a crude appearance.Han Jue didn't dare to carve his face onto it. Wasn't that just drawing attention to him?Then, Han Jue flashed into Xing Hongxuan's cave abode.Still cultivating, she was shocked by Han Jue's sudden appearance.However, when she saw that it was him, she smiled happily again.Han Jue immediately took out the Heavenly Puppet and said, \"Put this puppet in your storage ring. No matter where you go in the future, you must bring it with you. At the critical moment, it can save your life.\"With that, he returned to the Connate Cave Abode.Xing Hongxuan was pleasantly surprised as she looked at the Heavenly Puppet.Its figure was very similar to Han Jue.On the other side, Han Jue continued to create more Heavenly Puppets.With the first experience, Han Jue created two more Heavenly Puppets in the next year.The Heavenly Puppet was equivalent to his avatar. Apart from not having his Dharma treasures, it could unleash his true strength.It was very powerful!Han Jue had thought about creating an army.However, after creating the three puppets, he dismissed the idea.Creating a soul thought was equivalent to cutting off a piece of his soul. A few soul thoughts were fine, but a few dozen would be problematic!Any more and his soul would be reduced to a remnant soul.In addition, creating the Heavenly Puppet would delay his cultivation.In the past two years, his cultivation level had not increased at all. If he was obsessed with creating Heavenly Puppets, wouldn't that affect his true pursuit?That wouldn't do!It would delay his cultivation!Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comHan Jue took a deep breath.He put away the two puppets and left.Su Qi was secretly curious. What were those two wooden puppets?In the past two years, he had personally seen Han Jue create the Heavenly Puppets and felt that they were amazing.He couldn't figure it out and decided not to think about it.Han Jue gave the two puppets to Chang Yue'er and Fairy Xi Xuan.Chang Yue'er was pleasantly surprised and kept pestering him.It took a long time for him to escape.Fairy Xi Xuan was very calm about it. The two did not talk much.One was passionate, while the other was cold.Han Jue clicked his tongue in wonder.Yang Tiandong followed the Sect Master and was always outside. He couldn't be found for the time being.Previously, he was still considering if he should refine a Heavenly Puppet for Mo Zhu. In the end, he heard from Chang Yue'er that Mo Zhu had already headed to the secret hall.The secret hall was the Ancient Mystic Realm that Daoist Nine Cauldrons had discovered. He had created a new location for the sect inside, and the Spirit Qi there was richer than that of the inner sect. To join the secret hall, one had to be an elite disciple at the very least.In other words, the Jade Pure Sect now had a new hierarchy.The secret hall, the inner sect's eighteen peaks, and the outer sect!The Ancient Mystic Realm had yet to be fully explored, so only the secret hall was the safest. The inner sect had a teleportation formation leading there.However, the concentration of spiritual energy in the secret hall was not comparable to Han Jue's mountain.So, he was too lazy to move over.Back in the cave abode, Han Jue perked up and started cultivating.In the blink of an eye, three years passed.Three lines of words suddenly appeared in front of Han Jue.[You are already 200 years old.

Han Jue thought in surprise.He immediately took out the Frost Lord's Glazed Crown and began to connect with it using his blood.This crown was very cool-looking, being purple-blue in color, and looked very exquisite.From now on, Han Jue was armed with Numinous Treasures from head to toe. He was armed to the extreme. Nobody at the Soul Formation realm could hurt him at all!As for the Void Amalgamation Realm, they could forget about instantly killing him!Su Qi noticed the Glazed Crown and his eyes widened.It was his first time seeing such a handsome crown.After half a day, Han Jue finally made the Frost Lord's Glazed Crown recognize him as its master.He put the crown on, feeling more secure.Han Jue continued cultivating happily.\u2026Another five years passed.Daoist Nine Cauldrons left with a group of disciples and headed overseas.Before leaving, Chang Yue'er came to bid him farewell.It took Han Jue a long time to send this crying senior sister away.After Daoist Nine Cauldrons left, Han Jue became bored.

It seemed like she was looking for Li Qianlong's cave abode.He didn't expect that after so long, Daoist Li Qianlong would actually come here!The fifth level of the Soul Formation Realm was extremely high in the cultivation world of the Great Yan. If he returned openly, it would definitely cause a huge commotion.Han Jue had never heard of such a thing. Yang Tiandong, Chang Yue'er, and Xing Hongxuan often came to look for him, but none of them mentioned it. What did this mean?It meant that Li Qianlong had infiltrated them!Han Jue immediately searched for him.Li Qianlong was actually at the main peak.At that moment, Daoist Jingxu summoned all the disciples of the main peak. Xing Hongxuan was also present.Li Qianlong had an ordinary appearance and his aura was suppressed at the first level of the Golden Core Realm. He had an honest appearance, yet who would have imagined that he was the successor of the Poison King?Han Jue didn't send his divine sense into the main peak to avoid alerting the enemy.The reason why Daoist Jingxu had summoned all the disciples was to inform them of Daoist Nine Cauldrons' departure.When Li Qianlong found out, he was overjoyed, but he hid it well.He had finally found an opportunity!Previously, with Daoist Nine Cauldrons around, he didn't dare to act recklessly.Now that Daoist Nine Cauldrons had left, he finally felt as if the clouds had parted and he could finally see the sun.\"Calm down! There's one more standing in my way!\" Li Qianlong thought silently.The most mysterious person in the Jade Pure Sect!Deity Slaying Elder!He had heard that the reason why the Raincoat Sect was defeated was that the sect master slaughtered his way to the Jade Pure Sect and never returned.At that time, Daoist Nine Cauldrons had yet to return.In other words, Deity Slaying Elder had the terrifying ability to kill the sect master of the Raincoat Sect!Before Li Qianlong carried out his plan, he had to think of a way to deal with the Deity Slaying Elder.Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.However, he had yet to find out who the Deity Slaying Elder was. It was said that he came from Jade Serene Peak.Jade Serene Peak\u2026When he thought of that person on Jade Serene Peak, Li Qianlong's gaze became bitter.\u2026Ever since he discovered Li Qianlong, Han Jue would often pay attention to him while cultivating.If Li Qianlong didn't want to harm the Jade Pure Sect, he naturally couldn't kill him directly.He had sent a voice transmission to Xing Hongxuan. The inner sect of the Jade Pure Sect was very peaceful, and there had been no incidents.Just like that, five years passed.Han Jue broke through to the seventh level of the Soul Formation Realm!He was getting closer and closer to the Void Amalgamation Realm!Han Jue was very happy.He checked Li Qianlong's location again and discovered that he had already left the Jade Pure Sect.Han Jue didn't mind.It was fine as long as Li Qianlong didn't cause trouble.Han Jue checked the emails.[Your Dao Companion Xuan Qingjun experienced the aspects of life and comprehended a Mystical Power.][Your good friend Mo Fuchou has fallen to the demonic path.][Your Divine Pet, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, has comprehended its Innate Mystical Power.][Your good friend Daoist Nine Cauldrons was attacked by a Demon King and was severely injured.][Your good friend Daoist Nine Cauldrons is furious and his Dao heart is damaged.][Your good friend Zhou Fan obtained the Domination Physique, shaking heaven and earth.]\u2026Han Jue was stunned.F*ck!So much had happened in the past five years.Mo Fuchou had fallen to the demonic path.

He was constantly building his foundation.After so many years, the natural treasures in his mountain also began to mature one after another, and the Spirit Qi entered a period of explosive growth.Han Jue decided to try his best to reach the Void Amalgamation Realm!\u2026In the blink of an eye!Another ten years passed.Han Jue's cultivation level had reached the eighth level of the Soul Formation Realm, and he was not far from the ninth level!Every time he thought of the Void Amalgamation Realm, he would be very excited.One fine day, Li Qingzi came to visit.To prevent Su Qi from passing on his bad luck to him, Han Jue walked out of the cave abode.\"Elder Han, long time no see. How's your cultivation going?\" Li Qingzi asked warmly.He was in the limelight now.With Daoist Nine Cauldrons' help, his cultivation level had already reached the ninth level of the Nascent Soul realm.Apart from his cultivation, he was also the leader of the righteous path in the Great Yan Cultivation World.All these years, Han Jue didn't see him being attacked.\"Not bad.

This was the path that the system had planned for him forward.Han Jue silently chose the first option.It was very easy for something to happen during the Cultivation Conference. It was a big deal!Han Jue shook his head and said, \"Forget it, I won't go. Sect Master, be careful. Although things have been going smoothly for the Jade Pure Sect recently, the matter of the ancestor's departure will definitely be known by other forces.\"Li Qingzi sighed.This Elder Han's heart of cultivation was ridiculous!If it was him, with Han Jue's ability, he would have long been out enjoying life.[You rejected the Sect Master's invitation and obtained a Numinous Treasure.][Congratulations on obtaining the supreme-grade Numinous Treasure\u2014Book of Misfortune][Book of Misfortune: Unparalleled Numinous treasure.

If Li Qianlong returned and wanted to cause trouble, Han Jue had to know if he could kill him.Li Qingzi's expression changed when he heard that. \"Why do you ask, Elder Han?\"As soon as he said that, he felt that his attitude was not good. He hurriedly explained, \"This person was once my junior. His talent was unparalleled, but both he and Guan Yougang liked Fairy Xi Xuan. The two of them had a life-and-death battle and forced my master to make a move. However, Li Qianlong was not convinced and actually dared to make a move on my master. While imprisoned, he secretly fled the sect. Before he left, he left a letter saying that he would definitely overturn the Jade Pure Sect when he returned.\"He was very displeased when Li Qianlong was mentioned.Han Jue blinked.It was another tragedy caused by jealousy.No wonder Fairy Xi Xuan did not allow her disciples to talk about love.Han Jue said softly, \"Li Qianlong has returned, but he went out recently. He disguised himself and entered the main peak.\"Li Qingzi widened his eyes and trembled in anger.He grabbed Han Jue and said, \"If he comes back again, Elder Han, you have to catch him.

He frowned as he left.Han Jue returned to his cave abode and took out the Book of Misfortune.This was a supreme-grade Numinous Treasure!Han Jue was very excited and started to drip blood on it.Su Qi opened his eyes and looked at the Book of Misfortune in Han Jue's hand.The Book of Misfortune looked more like a black drawing scroll than a book.For some reason, when Su Qi saw the Book of Misfortune, he felt an inexplicable closeness.He liked this treasure!But liking was just liking, Su Qi did not dare to ask for it.He continued to cultivate.Because of his outstanding aptitude, Han Jue had imparted the Jade Pure Technique to Su Qi some time ago.The Jade Pure Technique was the ultimate technique of the Jade Pure Sect. It wasn't difficult for Han Jue to obtain it with his status.The two of them already had a master-disciple relationship.It took Han Jue an entire day to make the Book of Misfortune recognize him as its master.He injected Six Paths spirit energy into it and started cursing Li Qianlong.He imagined Li Qianlong's face in his mind.\u2026Between the mountains and rivers was a bamboo house.Li Qianlong knelt at the entrance.He asked in a low voice, \"Master, what must I do for you to leave the mountain?\"An old voice came from inside.\"I've already left the cultivation world for a thousand years. I don't want to participate in its disputes anymore. You can take revenge yourself. I've already passed on my legacy to you.

I'll rely on myself!\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experience\"No, that's my ultimate treasure. If I pass it to you, won't I be stupid if you used it to poison me to death?\"Li Qianlong almost spat out blood.He cursed in his heart.Becoming a disciple of the Poison King was not a stroke of luck.He had been the Poison King's pill tester for a hundred years. He had tried all kinds of poisons. That period of time could be said to be worse than death.The only consolation was that he would be the Poison King's only successor. In the end, this scoundrel, the Poison King, actually held back and did not impart all his skills.The Poison King's voice floated out again, \"Daoist Nine Cauldrons has already noticed my existence. I can't offend him rashly. Right now, the Jade Pure Sect is like the sun in the sky. Not many sects dare to offend them. However, if you insist, you can look for the Wei Family.

He was one of the most prominent figures among the younger generation of the Jade Pure Sect.\"Master, I plan to go to the Cultivation Convention. When the time comes, the various sects will spar.

Kill all those who are not convinced?\"Li Qingzi immediately became angry and scolded, \"Those dogs. I personally went to apologize, but they directly attacked me. Most of the time, I didn't even have the chance to speak. You seem to know the core disciple who fell into the demonic path. His name is Mo Fuchou. He didn't fall into the demonic path on his own accord. I suspect that someone is defaming him.\"Han Jue raised his eyebrows and said, \"Tell me more about it.\"Li Qingzi started to describe his ordeal.He first spoke of Mo Fuchou's origins.Mo Fuchou came from a cultivation family. Due to evidence of collusion with the fiendish cultivators, they were wiped out by the righteous sects. Only Mo Fuchou and Mo Zhu survived.Old Immortal Daoist Thunder had personally accepted Mo Fuchou as his disciple and given him a new name. Mo Fuchou was a name that Old Immortal Daoist Thunder had personally given him, hoping that he would forget his hatred and turn over a new leaf.Mo Fuchou had gone out to train and had met his former enemies. He had slain many of the sect's disciples and then attacked the other disciples of the righteous sects who had committed the crime.Li Qingzi felt that there was something fishy about this matter. After all, he had seen Mo Fuchou before. He was humble, and even if he could not hold back from killing the enemy, he should have returned after the first time. He shouldn't have been seeking revenge and gone mad.Now, more than five sects were chasing after Mo Fuchou. A few years ago, Mo Fuchou had no choice but to use his family's Mystical Power. In the end, it was a demonic path Mystical Power, causing him to become a demon.More and more people were killed by this Mystical Power. Mo Fuchou became a demonic cultivator and could not turn back anymore.\"This matter is too fishy. These sects didn't even ask me and directly pursued Mo Fuchou for revenge. Every injustice has its perpetrator and every debt has its debtor. I can accept that. But when I went to apologize, I was beaten up?\"The matters of the younger generation can involve the Sect Masters? It's obvious that they're using this opportunity to start a war!\"The more Li Qingzi spoke, the more agitated he became. He felt like he was about to cry.In the end, he still chose to give up.He sighed. \"Now that both the righteous and demonic paths are attacking us, we can't stop them. We should just run as you think.\"Daoist Nine Cauldrons left, while Guan Yougang was severely injured.How could Han Jue alone stop the righteous and demonic paths?Some powerful sects still had Soul Formation realm existences. For example, the Vermilion Bird Sword Sect had two. If all the sects joined forces, Han Jue alone would definitely not be able to stop them.Han Jue asked cautiously, \"Do they have Void Amalgamation Realm existences? Body Integration Realm existences?\"Li Qingzi said with widened eyes, \"How is that possible! Previously, Huang Zuntian's cultivation level was already at the ninth level of the Soul Formation Realm. If they had a cultivator at the Void Amalgamation Realm, how could they continue to be bullied?\"\"Could they be like our Jade Pure Sect, where our ancestors went out to cultivate and seek fortuitous encounters?\"The source of this content is lightnovelworld.com\"Definitely, but I've never heard of anyone at the Void Amalgamation Realm. Back then, when the Ancestor went to look for them one by one, they all acted like grandchildren.\"Li Qingzi couldn't help but sigh.If only Daoist Nine Cauldrons was still here.It was a rare opportunity for the Jade Pure Sect to grow. There was no need to fight. After a few hundred years, it would become the strongest sect in Great Yan.However, at this juncture, something happened.Li Qingzi felt very helpless.Ever since he became the Sect Master, he had sacrificed so much and suffered so much!In the end, it was all for nothing!Han Jue had a strange expression.Li Qingzi understood his thoughts. He sighed and slowly stood up.\"Prepare yourself well. In three days at most, the Jade Pure Sect will prepare to flee to the sea and seek refuge with the Ancestor.\"Han Jue hurriedly said, \"What are you saying! If I'm not running, why are you running?\"Stunned, Li Qingzi asked carefully, \"What do you mean?\"Han Jue said calmly, \"Let them come. They will understand one thing. The most terrifying person in the Jade Pure Sect is not the ancestor.\"All along, Han Jue's imaginary enemy had always been the Demon Taming Sect!What did he think of the Great Yan Cultivation World now?Come at me!How dare you disturb my cultivation? I'll make sure you never return!Li Qingzi was overjoyed.He understood Han Jue's character.Such a cowardly Han Jue dared to say such words. He was absolutely confident!\"What realm are you at now?\" Li Qingzi suppressed his surprise and asked.Han Jue replied, \"At least not inferior to the ancestor.\"Yeah.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comNot inferior!It would take him half a minute to kill Daoist Nine Cauldrons!This old man's movement techniques were too absurd!After a long while\u2026When Li Qingzi walked out of the Connate Cave Abode, he was still stunned.He felt as if he was dreaming.After Li Qingzi left, Han Jue cautiously tested the strongest person in the Jade Pure Sect other than him.It was still Guan Yougang.No enemy lurked.Han Jue felt a little pity.Where was Li Qianlong?Was he cursed to death?Han Jue was still looking forward to teaching Li Qianlong a lesson.In the end, he disappeared into thin air.What a pity.Han Jue shook his head and took out the Book of Misfortune. He cursed Xiao'e for a few days to vent his anger before continuing to cultivate.\u2026A year quickly passed.The Great Yan Cultivation World was in chaos.Mo Fuchou had killed his way to fame.

I'm only here to visit you! I have no ill intentions towards the Jade Pure Sect!\"Visit me?Han Jue was baffled.He hesitated. Should he attack?Without receiving a reply, Huang Jihao grew even more panicked.He continued, \"Recently, someone has been leading the righteous-demonic alliance to deal with the Jade Pure Sect. Our Sect Master sent me to inquire if the Jade Pure Sect needs help?\"Han Jue raised his eyebrows.Is the Vermilion Bird Sword Sect trying to stab the alliance in the back?Han Jue thought of a plan and said with a voice transmission, \"The Jade Pure Sect doesn't need any help. I will wait for all of you here. No matter how many of you come, you will all die.\"These words caused Huang Jihao's heart to beat wildly.What an arrogant tone!If it had been anyone else, Huang Jihao would have scoffed.

Han Jue didn't care if they could.Even if the nineteen sects attacked tomorrow, he would not be afraid.There was only one thing in his eyes.I should break through to the second level of the Void Amalgamation Realm as soon as possible!\u2026In a cave with a flickering flame, Xing Hongxuan sat in front of a fire.Roar\u2014A deafening roar came from outside the cave. It was terrifying.Xing Hongxuan slowly opened her eyes. She looked at the words carved on the mountain wall and frowned slightly.\"Why do I feel like something is missing?\" Xing Hongxuan thought bitterly.This was a mystic realm belonging to an ancient cultivator. Xing Hongxuan had discovered by chance that there was a cultivation technique recorded here. It was unfathomable. She mustered up the courage to cultivate it. Her cultivation level had improved significantly in the past year, but she was still far from completely mastering this cultivation technique.Xing Hongxuan couldn't help but think of Han Jue.If he were here, he might be able to answer her questions.With these thoughts in mind, Xing Hongxuan took out the Heavenly Puppet.Putting it next to her, she leaned her head against it and began to rest.Ever since she got the Heavenly Puppet, whenever she missed Han Jue, she would take it out.She often told the puppet what was on her mind.Because Han Jue's soul thought was hidden in the puppet, he was not worried that anything would happen to her.After a long while, Xing Hongxuan sat up straight and prepared to continue cultivating.At this moment, footsteps came from outside the cave.Xing Hongxuan immediately took out her equipment.A gray-robed old man with long hair and a youthful face walked in. Upon seeing the nervous Xing Hongxuan, he smiled and said, \"Don't worry, junior. I'm also here to study the cultivation technique.\"Here to comprehend the cultivation technique?Xing Hongxuan frowned in confusion.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comCould it be that this person had already discovered this mountain wall before she came here?Ignoring Xing Hongxuan, the gray-robed elder walked to the mountain wall and sat down. He stared at the words on the mountain wall and thought hard.Neither of them noticed the light in the eyes of the Heavenly Puppet.\u2026Inside the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue hesitated.Should he let the Heavenly Puppet attack?Ever since Xing Hongxuan had fallen into the Ancient Mystic Realm, he had kept an eye on her, fearing that something would happen to her.However, the gray-robed elder did not seem to have any ill intentions.Forget it.He decided to wait and see.It would be awkward if he couldn't defeat him.He continued to cultivate.In the blink of an eye, another two years passed.Xing Hongxuan and the gray-robed elder were still studying the cultivation technique on the mountain wall.

However, they have countless beauties who can topple cities and countries. The Wei Family has all sorts of marriages and even business outside of the Great Yan.

He hesitated and said, \"I don't think so.

They had advanced by leaps and bounds.He wondered what they had been through.Just as Han Jue was wondering, he suddenly sensed the Chaotic Heavenly Dog's aura.The fat dog squatted at the entrance of the cave abode and did not say a word. It looked like it wanted to say something but hesitated.Han Jue asked, \"What is it?\"The Chaotic Heavenly Dog immediately asked, \"Master\u2026 can I go out and gain experience? I can't stay in seclusion anymore!\"Han Jue frowned.The Chaotic Heavenly Dog waited uneasily.\"You're a divine beast. Once your identity is exposed, it will easily attract the attention of others.

Only then would he understand how good it was to keep a low profile and cultivate by his side.Pleasantly surprised, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog immediately rushed down the mountain.Before long\u2026The Black Hell Chicken came.Han Jue asked angrily, \"What? You want to go out, too?\"The Black Hell Chicken trembled in fear. \"How is that possible! I won't leave even if you beat me to death. I have to follow Master. It's too dangerous outside! That fat dog is finally gone. Master, can you teach me how to cultivate now?\"Han Jue immediately stood up.Indeed, he should teach the Black Hell Chicken some skills.The Black Hell Chicken had an intrinsic cultivation technique, but it lacked spells and Mystical Powers.The current Black Hell Chicken was the size of a pavilion.Seeing how big it was, Han Jue had an idea.He decided to impart \"Imitate Heaven and Earth\" to it.He first briefly introduced the power of Imitate Heaven and Earth.The Black Hell Chicken was pleasantly surprised and thought to itself, \"Damn fat dog, you didn't expect this, did you? Once you leave, I'll secretly learn Mystical Powers from my master. When you return, I'll see if I can beat you up!\"Just like that, Han Jue began to teach the Black Hell Chicken the cultivation technique.\u2026In a bustling city, Su Qi walked on a street with stalls on both sides as cultivators came and went.After leaving Han Jue for so many years, he was no longer so childish. There was no smile on his face, and he gave off the feeling of someone who had experienced the vicissitudes of life.Su Qi looked around as he walked.After the destruction of the Liu family, he had emptied their fortune before escaping.

He immediately apologized, \"Sorry.\"The woman had a pretty face but a fiery temper. She immediately pointed at him and scolded, \"You don't have eyes? I'll dig them out. Do you believe me?\"So fierce!Su Qi shook his head and laughed. Not angry, he prepared to walk around the woman.However, seeing that he did not care, the woman became even more furious.

Her smile was breathtakingly beautiful.He did not refuse.That was enough.Han Jue grabbed her hand, stunning Mo Zhu.She looked at him expectantly.However, Han Jue quickly let go.He had only imprinted his Six Paths Insignia on her soul. The difference in their cultivation levels was too great, so she couldn't sense it.\"That's all,\" Han Jue said expressionlessly.Mo Zhu nodded and left.The moment she turned around, she wanted to cry.She wondered if they would ever meet again.Why didn't he ask me to stay\u2026Why didn't he follow me\u2026Mo Zhu couldn't help but develop such thoughts.But she quickly composed herself. After all, this was the path she had chosen.After leaving the Connate Cave Abode, Mo Zhu was caught.Yeah.She was caught by Daoist Jingxu and Li Qingzi.You want to betray the sect?For more, visit lightnovelworld.comNo way!When she expressed her intention, Han Jue directly used his divine sense to inform Li Qingzi.How would Li Qingzi dare to let Mo Zhu betray the sect? How much trouble had Mo Fuchou and Zhou Fan caused the sect already?\"Han Jue!\" Mo Zhu's voice was filled with bitterness.Then, she was taken away by Li Qingzi and his companion.Han Jue especially reminded Li Qingzi not to mistreat her and arranged a place for her to be imprisoned for cultivation.Li Qingzi nodded understandingly.In the woods, a fat black chicken lamented, \"You want to eat my master? Dream on, woman!\"Han Jue didn't think too much and focused on Xun Chang'an at the foot of the mountain.This person had knelt for five years. There was no harm in taking him as a disciple. He shouldn't be running around.As long as he stayed on the mountain to cultivate with him, there would be no problem.Han Jue waved his hand and moved Xun Chang'an into the cave abode.Xun Chang'an was slightly dazed, but he remained kneeling on the ground, swaying.Even though he was a Foundation Establishment realm cultivator, kneeling for five years was still somewhat unbearable.\"Why aren't you calling me Master?\" Han Jue said coldly.Xun Chang'an subconsciously looked up at him.Damn.He was really ugly.Up close, the visual impact was tremendous.Xun Chang'an suddenly jolted awake. \"Deity\u2026 Slaying Elder?\"He hurriedly kowtowed to Han Jue.\"Disciple Xun Chang'an greets Master!\"\"Disciple Xun Chang'an greets Master!\"\"Disciple Xun Chang'an greets Master!\"Xun Chang'an wept with joy.

By spitting out Sword Qi, it is extremely lethal.]Spitting out Sword Qi?Not bad, it was a little showy.Han Jue smiled in satisfaction.He looked at Xun Chang'an again and said, \"Once you become my disciple, you can't leave this mountain unless you become immortal. Are you willing?\"Xun Chang'an was pleasantly surprised.As expected of the number one cultivator of Great Yan![Xun Chang'an has a favorable impression of you. Current favorability: 3 stars]Only three stars?Han Jue was unhappy.Looks like this fellow doesn't like men.Xun Chang'an replied, \"I wanted to cultivate in seclusion and leave the mortal world, so I came to find you.\"Han Jue nodded and said, \"Find a place to cultivate first. When you break through to the Golden Core Realm, I will teach you a spell.\"Xun Chang'an hurriedly stood up when he heard this.However, he almost fell down right after.Han Jue clearly heard the sound of joints cracking.He shook his head and laughed. He ignored Xun Chang'an and started to inherit the Firmament Sword Qi.\u2026Twelve years passed.Han Jue successfully broke through to the fourth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm.Ever since Xun Chang'an joined, the Spirit Qi in the cave abode had indeed increased.Xun Chang'an had also broken through to the Golden Core Realm. Han Jue asked him to go and receive the Jade Pure Technique.Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.After Daoist Nine Cauldrons returned, he strengthened the Jade Pure Technique and could now cultivate it to the Void Amalgamation Realm.Through interpersonal relationships, Han Jue noticed that the cultivation of the elders of the sect finally started to improve.Apart from cultivation techniques, the Spirit Qi of the sect had greatly improved after decades of refinement by the natural treasures. The Spirit Qi was like mist and could be seen with the naked eye. It covered the peaks like the legendary land of immortals, beautiful and mysterious.Regardless of whether it was the inner or outer sect, the cultivation levels of the disciples had all increased. It could be said that the entire sect was enjoying the benefits.The Jade Pure Sect was quickly becoming the number one sect of Great Yan.Guan Yougang's injuries finally healed.However, he seemed to have become a different person. He was no longer arrogant and domineering. He also often cultivated in seclusion.It was worth mentioning that over the years, Guan Yougang's favorability towards Han Jue had increased to 2.5 stars.Han Jue didn't understand what he was thinking, but it was fine as long as Guan Yougang didn't provoke him.On this day, Fairy Xi Xuan came to visit.Han Jue immediately told Xun Chang'an to go out and let her in.Witnessing Fairy Xi Xuan's peerless appearance, Xun Chang'an was momentarily absent-minded. When he arrived outside the cave, he couldn't help but think of his sweetheart.His heart, which had been still for a long time, began to stir again.Xun Chang'an sighed.He walked under a tree and gazed into the distance.It had been a long time since he last saw Fairy Xi Xuan. When Han Jue saw her again, he was still stunned.Fairy Xi Xuan was definitely the most beautiful woman he knew, especially her temperament.No wonder Li Qingzi, Li Qianlong, and Guan Yougang fought so hard for her.\"Fellow Daoist Han, long time no see.\" Fairy Xi Xuan smiled.Han Jue shook his head and said, \"Master, why are you so distant from me?\"Fairy Xi Xuan sighed. \"You're already a great cultivator at the Void Amalgamation Realm. You're two major realms higher than me. I didn't teach you anything and can't be considered your master. We were only related in name previously. If we continue to maintain this status, I won't be able to bear it and will lose my fortune.\"Han Jue thought about it and didn't refute her anymore.\"Fairy, why are you looking for me this time?\" Han Jue asked with a smile.Fairy Xi Xuan said, \"The Jade Pure Sect is preparing to send seven Nascent Soul elders to the Holy Land of the West Abyss State to discuss the Dao. Are you going?\"Han Jue immediately shook his head and said, \"I won't go. I don't need it.\"It was the truth.Fairy Xi Xuan smiled. \"Then forget it.\"The two of them chatted a little more.Not long after, Fairy Xi Xuan left.New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.comThe conversation between them was very calm. It was as if they were friends.Han Jue wasn't embarrassed. Instead, he felt very comfortable.With Fairy Xi Xuan by his side, even if he didn't speak, his mood would still be very calm.\"West Abyss? I wonder how that guy is doing,\" Han Jue muttered to himself.He clicked on his interpersonal link to check his emails.Too many people liked him. Most of them were from the Jade Pure Sect. The emails dazzled him.Han Jue suddenly noticed a filter for special attention next to the character profiles.He immediately set the people he wanted to pay special attention into that category.He clicked open the emails again and saw an option that only focused on these people.Han Jue chose the option and the number of emails decreased greatly.[Your good friend Huang Zuntian was attacked by a fellow sect cultivator] x75[Your disciple Su Qi is being hunted down by seven sects.][Your good friend Daoist Nine Cauldrons comprehended nature and his lifespan increased by 300 years.][Your Divine Pet Chaotic Heavenly Dog was attacked by fiendish cultivators] x641[Your Divine Pet Chaotic Heavenly Dog was attacked by righteous cultivators] x377[Your good friend Mo Fuchou was attacked by righteous cultivators] x983[Your good friend Zhou Fan is seriously injured.

Why did he go out and not return at all?Did he not want to leave after becoming a Demon King?Or had he completely transformed into a demon and wanted to become the supreme demon?Seeing that Yang Tiandong had awakened his Demon Saint bloodline, Han Jue was relieved.This kid wouldn't die now!There was no need to worry about him.As for Zhou Fan\u2026This protagonist had been captured, what an embarrassment!What kind of sect was the Snow Trampling Sect?Why haven't I heard of it?Perhaps it's not from the Great Yan Cultivation World?Han Jue thought as he continued reading the emails.The more he read, the more determined he became.It was best to cultivate peacefully in the Jade Pure Sect.\u2026At dusk, the setting sun was like blood and the sky was bleak.In the mountains, countless cultivators flew on their swords and floated in the air. It was a spectacular sight.All the cultivators stared in one direction.A man stood on the hill.It was Su Qi.His face was covered in blood. His hair was messy and his robes were tattered. He looked extremely pathetic.He gritted his teeth and looked at the enemies in the sky.A middle-aged man standing on the flying sword pointed at Su Qi and shouted angrily, \"Demon, where are you running! You must die today!\"The other cultivators cursed.Su Qi was being hunted down because he had too many treasures on him.In the past few decades, he had killed countless cultivators and taken away all their treasures. Not long ago, he had accidentally displayed his wealth at the auction and was targeted by others. It wasn't easy for him to kill the intruder, but in the end, the other party's identity was too great.The elder of the deceased came to hunt him down. Just as Su Qi was about to die, the master in Su Qi's heart protected him and secretly killed the elder.Just like that, there was no end to the matter, as it involved more and more people.Su Qi had more and more storage rings, but more trouble also accompanied.Updated from lightnovelworld.comThis time, seven sects had gathered to kill him.Su Qi was only at the Golden Core Realm.

The cultivators chasing him had all died, so they had always suspected that there was someone behind him.So it was his master!The middle-aged cultivator who had cursed Su Qi earlier shouted, \"Fellow Daoist! Why are you hiding in the dark? Are you feeling guilty?\"However, no one answered him.The middle-aged cultivator looked at Su Qi again.He discovered that Su Qi had a mocking, smug look on his face as if they were the ones who would die instead of him.Su Qi's confidence made the middle-aged cultivator panic even more.Boom!Thunder clouds gathered and the sky quickly darkened.Everyone looked around nervously.Whoosh\u2014A gust of wind blew, growing stronger and stronger.The cultivators were horrified to find that the wind was very strange. There were wind blades that couldn't be seen with the naked eye. They were extremely sharp and tore their clothes apart. They were so shocked that they hurriedly used their spirit energy to defend themselves.Apart from Su Qi, everyone else suffered.Su Qi had a look of admiration.As expected of Senior\u2026Wait, no!Master!Master was so powerful!Thunder rumbled and wind raged. It was as if the end of the world had arrived.Only when the first bolt struck did the seven sects realize that a nightmare had come.It was no ordinary thunder.It was heavenly thunder!\u2026For more, visit lightnovelworld.comA year was a long time for mortals.Eighteen years was enough for a person to grow up. To Han Jue, it passed very quickly, like a dream.His cultivation level had broken through to the fifth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm!The speed of his breakthrough was already very fast. One had to know that Daoist Nine Cauldrons was still stuck at the eighth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm and Xiao'e was still at the second level.While cultivating, Han Jue imparted the Heartless Flying Sword to Xun Chang'an.After cultivating the Heartless Flying Sword for ten years, Xun Chang'an was pleasantly surprised to find that he did not seem to be thinking about the past.Little did he know that his sexual desire was decreasing.After breaking through, Han Jue habitually took out the Book of Misfortune and cursed Xiao'e.The emails could only focus on the situation of people he had a good relationship with. Han Jue couldn't see the situation of the enemy, but Xiao'e's image was still there, which meant that he was still alive.Before Xiao'e died, Han Jue wouldn't give up on cursing him.Who asked this fellow to have such a high level of hatred for him? After so many years, it did not decrease at all.Han Jue cursed him as he checked the emails in his interpersonal relationships.Most people were attacked in the last eighteen years.Rather than attacking, it was more like fighting.It was impossible for everyone to be attacked. Most of the time, they would be the first to attack.The world was dangerous. He had to stay away.Perhaps with Han Jue's current cultivation, he was not afraid of being attacked. However, if this happened too many times, it would affect his cultivation.Just like Yang Tiandong and Zhou Fan, they were always in the top three.The Chaotic Heavenly Dog was catching up to them as well.Every time he saw the Chaotic Heavenly Dog being beaten, Han Jue found it funny.Serves you right for not listening to me!Although the Chaotic Heavenly Dog was constantly being beaten, its cultivation level kept increasing.It was the same for the others. It looked like they were all fighting for fortuitous encounters.Several days later, Xing Hongxuan came to visit.Han Jue chased Xun Chang'an out and let her in.\"Husband, I've obtained a great fortuitous encounter in the past few decades and gained enlightenment of a divine technique. Do you want to learn it? I can teach it to you!\"Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comXing Hongxuan ran to him excitedly and said as if she was presenting a treasure.Han Jue shook his head and said, \"I have my own divine technique. I don't need it.\"Xing Hongxuan had indeed obtained a huge opportunity. Her cultivation level had soared to the eighth level of the Golden Core Realm.She was almost catching up to Zhou Fan, a bearer of Connate providence.Xing Hongxuan flipped her right hand, and two green fruits the size of a fist appeared in her hand. She smiled and said, \"These are strange fruits that I found in the Ancient Mystic Realm. After consuming them, they can increase one's blood vitality and strengthen one's physique. They're very magical. I only ate one of them, and I can crush a small mountain with one palm.\"Han Jue took a look and realized that this green fruit was extraordinary.He took one and started eating.The fruit entered his throat and instantly melted, turning into a hot stream that flowed into Han Jue's body.Then, Han Jue felt warm all over.The effect was obvious!Han Jue immediately ate the entire fruit.Xing Hongxuan handed the remaining one to him.\"How can I accept this?\" Han Jue said helplessly but still obediently ate the green fruit.Xing Hongxuan smiled, \"It's fine. As long as I can help you, I'll be happy.\"After eating the two green fruits, Han Jue took out some equipment and gave them to her.They were all loot seized from enemies.Xing Hongxuan wanted to reject him, but Han Jue insisted, so she could only accept it.Xing Hongxuan felt extremely happy.\"Take out your Heavenly Puppet. I'll improve it,\" Han Jue said.Xing Hongxuan's face reddened slightly upon hearing this. She reluctantly took out the Heavenly Puppet.Han Jue's expression turned strange.The Heavenly Puppet's face was actually carved out. It was Han Jue's face. Although there was a difference in their looks, their facial features were similar.The strange thing was that the mouth of the Heavenly Puppet was a little red as if it had been rouged.Could it be\u2026 Han Jue didn't dare to think about it.Pretending not to notice, he took the puppet and poured his Six Paths spirit energy into it.The Heavenly Puppet did not have a cultivation realm. He only needed to replace the Six Paths spirit energy inside to increase its battle prowess to the Void Amalgamation Realm.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comOf course, the Heavenly Puppet could only be raised by Han Jue. The spirit energy of others had no effect on it.The Heavenly Puppet was equivalent to Han Jue's spiritual incarnation.Replenishing the Heavenly Puppet with spirit energy was not troublesome and it wouldn't take long.Xing Hongxuan sat at the side and asked softly, \"Has Mo Zhu looked for you recently?\"Chang Yue'er had left, but she had another love rival.After not being here for so many years, she didn't know if Mo Zhu had made a move on Han Jue.\"Yes,\" Han Jue replied and recounted what happened.Xing Hongxuan sighed. \"What a pity.\"\"What's a pity?\"\"Nothing,\" Xing Hongxuan replied as she waved her hand.The two of them started to chat. Xing Hongxuan talked about her experiences over the years. Han Jue learned about the cultivation world through her.Ten days later.Xing Hongxuan walked to the entrance. After confirming that her clothes were clean, she left with a flushed face.Han Jue sat on the bed and pulled at his wrinkled clothes. He sighed.However, he still smiled.\u2026Five years later, Li Qingzi came to visit.Han Jue threw Xun Chang'an out again and let him in.Seeing Li Qingzi's worried expression, Han Jue's heart skipped a beat.Did something happen again?It had only been a few decades!Li Qingzi found a chair and sat down. He then looked at Han Jue and sighed. \"Elder Han, something bad has happened. The cultivation world of Great Wei has been unified. The leader is the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect. They've found a powerful guest elder from somewhere and have said that they want to unify the cultivation world around them.\"Han Jue was puzzled. \"They're all cultivators. Instead of going into seclusion to comprehend the Dao of Heaven and Earth and pursue eternal life, why are they fighting for territory like ordinary people?\"Li Qingzi shook his head. \"The ambitions of fiendish cultivators will only increase as their cultivation level increases. Furthermore, the more cultivation worlds they occupy, the more cultivation resources they can obtain.\"\"How powerful is that guest elder?\"\"I'm not sure. At the very least, he's at the Void Amalgamation Realm. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to unite the cultivation world of Great Wei so quickly.\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experience\"Could he be at the Body Integration Realm?\"\"If so, Elder Han, what will you do?\"\"We'll see when the time comes.

He understood what Han Jue meant.He couldn't help but sigh.Elder Han's talent was truly rare.After a few decades, his cultivation level would definitely increase greatly.Han Jue smiled and said, \"In that case, I don't have to run.\"They smiled at each other.Unknowingly, the person Li Qingzi relied on the most had become Han Jue.Although the two of them didn't interact much, whenever the Jade Pure Sect encountered danger, the first person Li Qingzi thought of was Han Jue.\"By the way, where's my disciple? Didn't you look for him after he disappeared?\" Han Jue asked.Speaking of which, Yang Tiandong went missing because he followed the sect to the cultivation meeting.Li Qingzi's expression turned strange, and he said, \"I've found him, but he doesn't want to come back. He's already a Demon King and is very famous among the demons in the Great Yan Cultivation World. He might become the Great Yan Demon King in another hundred years.\"Han Jue was speechless.Indeed.Li Qingzi smiled. \"Recently, several Nascent Soul cultivators have joined the sect. I've also convinced two Soul Formation cultivators to join the Jade Pure Sect most of the year.\"People pursued greater ambitions.Right now, the Jade Pure Sect was definitely the strongest in the cultivation world of Great Yan. The Spirit Qi in their sect was also far superior to that of other sects.Han Jue nodded.The stronger the Jade Pure Sect was, the better it was for him.To be honest, he was definitely the most leisurely elder in the Jade Pure Sect. He had only made a few moves in the past hundred years and was never overly worked.The spiritual flowers and spiritual herbs that had been cultivated on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain were specially guarded by disciples. Han Jue only needed to do one thing.Cultivate.\"After so many years, your deeds as Deity Slaying Elder are almost forgotten. Only the older generation like us still talk about your prestige. Now, it's the world of Zhou Fan, Mo Fuchou, Yang Tiandong, and other favored geniuses. The three of them can be said to be influential figures. Unfortunately, they're no longer working for the Jade Pure Sect. By the way, dozens of years ago, a demonic dog ran rampant in the cultivation world. I heard from the disciple's description that the demonic dog seems to be the one raised by you?\"Updated from lightnovelworld.comLi Qingzi suddenly recalled something and asked.Upon arriving at the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, he did not see the Chaotic Heavenly Dog.Han Jue replied, \"Ignore it. It wants to go out and explore.

It was worth improving.Han Jue immediately closed his eyes.The Ten Thousand Sword Sect could summon at most ten thousand sword shadows in the long river of history.Although it created a huge scene, its accuracy and lethality were still poor.Han Jue suddenly had an idea.If he combined the Three Pure Shadow Sword Technique with the Ten Thousand Sword Sect\u2026Gasp\u2014How terrifying!More than ten thousand sword shadows that could freely kill!He would comprehend it just like that!In high spirits, Han Jue fully focused on his epiphany.\u2026The West Abyss State was a region without any dynasties. There were many demons here, and it was difficult for mortal dynasties to enter. However, there were many cultivation sects here, even more than in the Great Yan Cultivation World.The True Martial Sect was one of the top orthodox sects in West Abyss State.In a pavilion, Huang Jihao sat on the bed and cultivated.The door suddenly opened and a blue-robed man walked in.He had a handsome appearance, with sharp eyebrows and bright eyes, as if he had walked out of a painting.The blue-robed man walked to the table and sat down. He placed his sword on the table and poured himself a cup of tea. He smiled and said, \"Huang Jihao, you still haven't thought it through?\"Huang Jihao opened his eyes and expressionlessly said, \"I lost to you not because my sword techniques are lacking.

You have a natural Sword Heart, so you shouldn't waste your talent.\"When you become a sword immortal, it will be an honor for the Vermilion Bird Sword Sect.\"The blue-shirted man said seriously, his eyes even revealing anticipation.Huang Jihao smiled bitterly. \"Is my talent in the sword truly unparalleled? But I have seen a genius in the sword that is even more monstrous than me. That person's sword Qi is even stronger than yours.\"Huang Jihao recalled the time when he faced Han Jue's sword Qi and couldn't help but tremble.The blue-shirted man laughed loudly.He smiled and asked, \"Is this man from your Great Yan?\"Huang Jihao nodded.The blue-shirted man said proudly, \"Absolutely impossible! There can't be a sword cultivator stronger than me in the Great Yan Cultivation World!\"Huang Jihao asked seriously, \"Have you heard of the Jade Pure Sect's Deity Slaying Elder? His strength is already comparable to a Void Amalgamation Realm cultivator. The Nine Dragons Sect's Wei Yuan returned in low spirits and did not mention a single word about the battle. It can be seen just how powerful the Deity Slaying Elder is.\"The blue-shirted man said disdainfully, \"Wei Yuan doesn't have the talent. He managed to reach the Void Amalgamation Realm by chance. In order to reach a higher level, he was even hired by others and embarrassed us Void Amalgamation Realm cultivators.

He couldn't help but look at the blue-robed man and ask, \"What happened?\"The blue-shirted man held his sword and walked out of the room.Huang Jihao followed closely behind.The two of them arrived at the courtyard. This courtyard was located on a mountain peak and could overlook most of the scenery of the True Martial Sect.Many disciples of the sect unsheathed their swords and flew uncontrollably to the high school.

Unexpectedly, Daoist Calm Sky suffered a setback in the Jade Pure Sect.Liu Bumie gritted his teeth and asked, \"Who is that?\"Daoist Calm Sky sighed and said, \"The Deity Slaying Elder. If you send someone to investigate, you might be able to find out about his reputation. This person is very low-profile, but the Jade Pure Sect was able to become the number one sect in Great Yan. He's the main reason!\"Liu Bumie frowned.He couldn't understand how such an expert was willing to stay in the Great Yan.\"Forget it. We won't provoke the Great Yan.

Because he was extremely afraid and didn't dare to hate him, he kept this favorability.Daoist Calm Sky reminded Han Jue of something.Perhaps he could crush his enemies, but he might not necessarily kill them every time.In the cultivation world, there were many capable people. As the enemies got stronger, they would have many ways to protect their lives.He had to be careful when killing enemies in the future.It would be best to ambush and catch them off guard.Han Jue carefully recalled the fight.He felt that the problem could be caused by him attacking twice.Yeah.That was definitely the case!He had to kill the enemy instantly. He couldn't give the enemy any breathing space.I was too careless!He couldn't let his guard down in the future.

Demon King, when are we going to massacre the Great Yan humans?\"Yang Tiandong cursed silently. He was really a good dog!He even seriously doubted if what the Old Tree Demon King had said about Demon King Dian Su was true.Perhaps Old Tree Demon had deliberately beautified Demon King Dian Su to worsen the image of the human race.Kneeling close to Demon King Dian Su, Yang Tiandong felt unprecedented killing intent.This Demon King had killed countless beings, far beyond Yang Tiandong's imagination!\"Massacre the human race?

It was rare to see two trees intertwined like this.Xun Chang'an cupped his fists at him.Li Qingzi was secretly surprised. What kind of tree was this?It was definitely not simple if it was planted at the entrance of Han Jue's cave abode.Li Qingzi couldn't figure it out and didn't think too much about it.At the same time, Han Jue opened the emails.It had been many years since he had read them.

He first checked the Fusang Tree's health, then found the Black Hell Chicken and taught it a spell.The Black Hell Chicken was transforming continuously towards the Black Hell Phoenix. Its cultivation level was also increasing continuously. It was now comparable to a Nascent Soul realm cultivator.The cultivation realm of demons was different from that of humans, but mainly because of the difference in the Nascent Soul Realm. The cultivation realms after were still the same. Demons did not have a Nascent Soul, but they could cultivate their Demon Cores and Essence Soul.Han Jue did not wish for the Chaotic Heavenly Dog to come back and beat up the Black Hell Chicken after wandering outside for so long.

Han Jue jolted awake and his consciousness returned to his body.He gasped in perspiration.\"Who was that person?\"This was the first time Han Jue encountered such a powerful existence. Just the sword intent alone was enough to tear him apart.Fortunately, the other party didn't have any killing intent.

His nervousness from being scared off by the mysterious sword immortal vanished.Han Jue raised his right hand and a small sword condensed in his palm.Reincarnation Sword Intent!Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceHe finally had his own sword intent!In the future, if someone came to challenge him, he would directly use the Reincarnation Sword Intent to crush the target.

Han Jue didn't appear, but many swindlers claimed that they were the destined ones who caused the abnormal phenomenon.Han Jue didn't know all of this. Even if he knew, he'd be indifferent.\u2026North Region, Demon Taming Sect.In an empty valley, hundreds of disciples sat together facing a stone tablet. On the stone tablet was a line of obscure blood-colored words.Su Qi was among them. He looked worried.He didn't want to cultivate the Demon Taming Sect's demonic arts. He didn't want to be a fiendish cultivator but a righteous cultivator instead.But why had his master not made a move yet?Ever since he joined the Demon Taming Sect, he had often been bullied because he did not want to follow the fiendish cultivators to do evil. Not fitting in, he would naturally be ostracized. Fortunately, the disciples who had bullied him had died for some strange reason, so no one dared to provoke him now.Su Qi knew that his master was helping him secretly.It seemed that the Demon Taming Sect was still very powerful. Even his master did not dare to attack rashly.At this moment\u2026A figure suddenly appeared next to the monolith.\"All disciples, hurry to the sect. Elder Xiao'e is dead. All disciples, go and pay respects!\"The newcomer shouted. His words caused an uproar.An elder had fallen!In the Demon Taming Sect, one had to be at least at the Void Amalgamation Realm to become an elder.A Void Amalgamation Realm mighty figure had perished?This was no small matter!The disciples stood up and flew towards the sect.Su Qi followed the crowd and was secretly excited. \"Could it be Master? It should be him. No sect in the North State would dare to provoke the Demon Taming Sect. Even a Void Amalgamation Realm cultivator wouldn't die for no reason.\"For more, visit lightnovelworld.comOn the other side, in a temple.Xiao'e's corpse lay on the ground. A huge cauldron was beside it with a candle in it. Green smoke protected his weak soul.More than ten high-ranking members of the Demon Taming Sect stood around.Sect Master Tu Quan's expression darkened. \"Junior Xiao'e, do you have any last words?\"They had already tried their best, but there was nothing they could do.Xiao'e's soul would only last a little longer before dissipating and entering the cycle of reincarnation. From then on, they would be separated by life and death. Even if he was reincarnated, they wouldn't be able to recognize him in his next life.Xiao'e was in a state of confusion, having already experienced despair. Before his death, he recalled and realized that all of this had happened after he had left the Great Yan.He thought of Han Jue's beautiful face.For some reason, he had a strong feeling. Ever since his plan was broken by Han Jue, he had never been happy. All kinds of unlucky things kept happening. After cultivating for a period of time, it was always easy to encounter inner demons.Excluding all possibilities, the last seemingly impossible one was definitely the truth!Xiao'e's eyes gradually regained their glow. He looked at his fellow disciples and gritted his teeth. \"Don't go to the Great Yan! Don't go to the Great Yan! Don't provoke the Jade Pure Sect of the Great Yan\u2026\"These were Xiao'e's last words.He couldn't understand how Han Jue harmed him, but his intuition told him that it was definitely related to him.Mysterious and bizarre enemies were the most terrifying!Xiao'e did not want the Demon Taming Sect to follow in his footsteps.As for revenge\u2026Xiao'e had been through so much bad luck that he no longer wanted revenge. All he wanted now was for the future of the Demon Taming Sect to be safe.And for himself\u2026He just wanted to reincarnate in a nice place.Tu Quan frowned and asked, \"Is it because of the Jade Pure Sect that you have been so miserable?\"He turned to the others. \"What is the Great Yan?\"Everyone shook their heads. They had never heard of the Great Yan.Xiao'e's soul body started to dissipate. He weakly said, \"Senior, don't help me take revenge\u2026 never provoke the Great Yan's Jade Pure Sect\u2026\"Before he could finish, his soul completely vanished.Everyone from the Demon Taming Sect fell silent.Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comThere was only one question in their minds.Where was the Great Yan's Jade Pure Sect?\u2026After comprehending the Reincarnation Sword Intent, Han Jue went into seclusion for another eight years.Eight years was nothing to him and the Jade Pure Sect, but to the disciples of the sect, it was a very long time.Sitting on the Calm Meditation Mat, Han Jue was already close to the ninth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm.It had to be said that a Grand Unity Numinous Treasure was indeed impressive!On this day, Han Jue left the cave abode to check on the Fusang Tree, while stretching his body as well.Xun Chang'an saw an opportunity and hurriedly stood up, imitating his actions.Han Jue looked at him and started checking his emails.[Your disciple Yang Tiandong was attacked by a Demon King.][Your good friend Zhou Fan is being hunted by ten sects.][Your good friend Zhou Fan was attacked by a righteous cultivator] x483[Your good friend Zhou Fan is seriously injured.

This King can't take it! Why is this happening?\"Demon King Dian Su grabbed his hair and roared. That damned mysterious power was interfering with his cultivation again.He had already sworn to the heavens, so why was he still suffering like this?Yang Tiandong was also very curious as to who Demon King Dian Su had offended to be able to curse him endlessly.To make Demon King Dian Su so mad, it must be a powerful being!Most importantly, although Demon King Dian Su was mad, he didn't dare to scold the other party. He was still very fearful.Demon King Dian Su's eyes were blood red. He stared at Yang Tiandong and said in a low voice, \"Tell me! What do you think I should do?\"Yang Tiandong rolled his eyes and said, \"Father, is it possible that\u2026 the Immortal Deity does not believe your words? If you personally visit the human sects and become friends with them, perhaps the Immortal Deity will change his opinion of you?\"Upon hearing this, Demon King Dian Su's eyes lit up. This made sense.\"But there are so many sects in the Great Yan. Should I visit them one by one and smile at them?\"\"Of course not. You just have to pay a visit to the strongest sect!\"\"Which sect is the strongest in the Great Yan?\"\"The Jade Pure Sect. I was a disciple of this sect previously. I might be able to speak up for you and save some misunderstandings.\"\"Alright! Let's go to the Jade Pure Sect tomorrow. No, today, now! I really can't take it anymore!\"\u2026Less than half a year after Han Jue learned that Xiao'e had died, Demon King Dian Su rushed to the Jade Pure Sect.Yang Tiandong asked him to wait nearby while he visited his master.Han Jue was the Deity Slaying Elder of the Jade Pure Sect. It was very easy for him to have conflicts with Demon King Dian Su.Yang Tiandong knew his master very well. Although he kept a low profile and claimed to be afraid of death, if the Jade Pure Sect really encountered trouble, he would definitely not let it go.However, Dian Su was not a weakling. Yang Tiandong didn't want them to fight.Inside the Connate Cave Abode.When Han Jue learned that the Demon King Dian Su was here, his first reaction was to enter the simulation trial.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comDemon King Dian Su was very powerful!Han Jue used ten seconds for the first fight.No way!As a cultivator at the eighth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm, it actually took him ten seconds to kill a fourth-level Body Integration Realm cultivator?Han Jue ignored Yang Tiandong and continued the simulation.This time, he directly activated his trump card. The Primordial Judgment Sword used the Reincarnation Sword Intent and the Six Paths spirit energy to execute the Heavenly Punishment Ghost Deity Sword, instantly killing Dian Su!Han Jue was relieved now.It was fine as long as he could kill him instantly.He opened his eyes, looked at Yang Tiandong, and asked casually, \"Why is Demon King Dian Su here at the Jade Pure Sect?\"This time, his attitude was completely different, giving Yang Tiandong a sense of fearlessness.Yang Tiandong secretly admired him. As expected of his master, he was truly clever.The fact that Demon King Dian Su could wait outside already indicated his attitude. If it was the Sect Master, even if he knew of Demon King Dian Su's attitude, he would still be nervous.Yang Tiandong began to describe what had happened to Dian Su.Han Jue almost laughed out loud after hearing it.Demon King Dian Su actually suspected that it was the work of an immortal. This was also good. Having an ally was better than having an enemy.\"Yes, bring Demon King Dian Su to see Sect Master. I'll send a voice transmission to him now,\" Han Jue said.Yang Tiandong was overjoyed. He quickly bowed and left.Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Li Qingzi.When Li Qingzi learned of this, how could he dare to refuse? He had heard of Demon King Dian Su's reputation. Just like how the Chinese knew of the Demon Ox, the legend of the Demon King Dian Su was deeply rooted in the Great Yan. It was all thanks to the dog slave-like Old Tree Demon who spread it everywhere.News of Demon King Dian Su's visit quickly spread throughout the sect.The disciples were extremely nervous. They didn't know that Demon King Dian Su had come to discuss matters with the Jade Pure Sect and thought that a war was about to break out.The ten thousand inner sect disciples were all on high alert.Ever since Daoist Nine Cauldrons led the development of the sect, the number of inner sect disciples had exceeded 15,000. There were also more than 30,000 outer sect disciples. There were also 1,000 elite disciples in the secret hall.Not only that, but the Jade Pure Sect had also recruited nearly ten Nascent Soul realm guest elders. Their overall strength was already rushing towards the strongest of the Great Yan.Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comHan Jue didn't cultivate and kept paying attention to the situation of the main peak.Fortunately, Demon Monarch Dian Su was indeed afraid. He spoke to Li Qingzi in a very calm manner. The two of them only chatted casually and did not discuss any conditions.Demon King Dian Su only came to express his good intentions. He hoped that the two forces would form a friendly relationship and not become enemies in the future.Li Qingzi naturally would not reject.After chatting for four hours, Demon Monarch Dian Su left with Yang Tiandong.Before leaving, Yang Tiandong bid farewell to Han Jue.After he left, Han Jue was still a little unhappy.But this was also good. Yang Tiandong had someone to rely on and didn't have to trouble him in the future.Han Jue decided not to curse Demon King Dian Su anymore unless he caused trouble.\"Sigh, Demon King Dian Su has surrendered.

He guessed that this fellow was cultivating in seclusion to increase his cultivation.Su Qi was in seclusion. The world was peaceful!Despite this, Han Jue hoped that he wouldn't enter seclusion during this period of time.In addition, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog was too unrestrained. Han Jue suddenly didn't dare to be its master anymore. How many enemies had it made?Huang Zuntian's luck was good. Treasures that could increase one's cultivation potential were all legendary treasures.That made sense. With the Nine Dragons Sect in Huang Zuntian's hands, it was not difficult for him to gather resources.The cultivation world was as exciting as ever. Zhou Fan and the Chaotic Heavenly Dog had probably already made their mark and were stirring up trouble all around the world.Through the emails, Han Jue seemed to have read many novels and benefited greatly.It was still the same logic.

Recently, Xing Hongxuan felt that something was missing, so she rushed back to this mystic realm and found this cave to continue cultivating the divine technique.Coincidentally, Enlightened Old Monster returned. He was shocked to discover that she had already mastered the technique and wanted to take her in as his disciple.Xing Hongxuan rejected him at first, but since he kept pestering her, she had to admit that she was already married.Enlightened Old Monster had a high cultivation level. After calculating with his fingers, he realized that Xing Hongxuan was not fated to be married. Xing Hongxuan could only helplessly say that she had already agreed to marry an elder from the same sect.

I really don't want to leave my husband.\"On the other side, Han Jue also discovered their conversation through the Heavenly Puppet.Han Jue felt that it was impossible for there to be hatred for no reason, so he started checking from the three Heavenly Puppet.

The Black Hell Chicken wanted to follow but was blocked by the array formation.It arrived in front of Xun Chang'an and smiled. \"Do you think Xing Hongxuan will eat master?\"Xun Chang'an's face twitched. \"Perhaps.\"Hearing the Black Hell Chicken's words, Xun Chang'an suddenly thought of his beloved, and a small flame ignited in his heart.Damn it!Is this foul chicken doing this on purpose?This sentence was too hurtful!Xun Chang'an's heart, which was as dry as a well, stirred again.The seal of the love tribulation began to loosen.\"Although my master doesn't like to go out, there are always women who come looking for him and want to eat him. What do you think will happen if they are alone in the same room? Will our master be in danger?\"Xun Chang'an glared at it and cursed, \"Get lost! Go cultivate!\"The Black Hell Chicken was depressed.What was wrong with this kid?What a temper!\u2026Inside the Connate Cave Abode.Xing Hongxuan stood in front of Han Jue and became angrier as she talked about Enlightened Old Monster.She was unhappy with the elder's high and mighty attitude, as if the Jade Pure Sect was a remote village and Han Jue was only a mortal.Han Jue smiled and asked, \"What he said is true. Aren't you tempted?\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceXing Hongxuan sat down and smiled as she replied, \"How can that be? I'm going to keep pestering you. My husband will definitely become an immortal. I'm still waiting for you to rise up.\"As she spoke, she took out a bottle of pills from her sleeve and said, \"I found this bottle in the mystic realm. The Spirit Qi is very strong. I only sniffed it, and my Golden Core became unstable. Therefore, it doesn't suit me. It should suit you, my husband.\"Han Jue took the bottle and opened it.Eh?Spirit Qi was indeed abundant!He injected his Six Paths spirit energy into it. There was no danger.\"Yes, thank you.\" Han Jue smiled.Xing Hongxuan smiled.Several days later, she left the cave abode in satisfaction.\u2026On the wasteland, the setting sun was like blood as it continued to the end of the world.Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou sat on a huge rock.After successfully breaking through, Zhou Fan was in high spirits. From time to time, he would twist his neck and admire his perfect body.\"Senior, let me take revenge for you first. After that, I plan to conquer the world and make a name for myself. I want to be number one in the world!\" Zhou Fan said proudly, his tone filled with confidence.Mo Fuchou said helplessly, \"You're only at the Nascent Soul realm. How dare you be so arrogant?\"Zhou Fan smiled and said, \"I'm not stupid. I'll definitely start challenging cultivators of the same cultivation realm. I want to prove to her that I'm worthy of her!\"A few decades ago, Mo Fuchou and Zhou Fan met a woman. Zhou Fan fell in love at first sight and wanted to pursue her. However, she had a powerful background and said that it was impossible for them to be together. Even if they were in love, her father would not agree. If she wanted to marry, she could only marry a powerful cultivator.These words stimulated Zhou Fan. He hated it when others looked down on him. Therefore, he took the extreme path.Mo Fuchou often advised against it, but it was useless.\"Let's challenge the True Martial Sect first. I heard that there are many elites there.\" Zhou Fan smiled in high spirits.He suddenly thought of someone and smiled. \"Senior, do you still remember Han Jue from the Jade Pure Sect? You said that he might be the Deity Slaying Elder and that he had once killed a Soul Formation cultivator. I think that with my current strength, I can match up to a Soul Formation cultivator. Have I finally caught up to him?\"Han Jue?Mo Fuchou frowned and said, \"Brother Han's aptitude is very high, and he has been cultivating in seclusion. His cultivation level is probably very high. I'm afraid that just the strength of the Soul Formation Realm isn't enough to defeat him.\"After leaving Great Yan for so long, he wondered how the Jade Pure Sect was doing.Zhou Fan shook his head and smiled. \"How is that possible? It's not right to cultivate in seclusion. You and I are both mortals. How can cultivation alone be enough for a mortal to become an immortal? You have to seek opportunities in the world. Look at me, my cultivation level has advanced by leaps and bounds. My former enemy is also cultivating, but he's still stuck at his original realm.\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experience\"When I go back in the future, I have to spar with Han Jue and let him realize this.

He then injected his Six Paths spirit energy to nourish it.He had to personally plant such a treasure. Xun Chang'an's cultivation techniques were limited. Most of the time, he let the Fusang Tree grow on its own. Fortunately, the divine tree was strong.\"Master, what's this?\" Xun Chang'an asked curiously.Han Jue replied, \"A gourd seed. You have to take care of it in the future.\"Xun Chang'an was curious. Where did Han Jue get a gourd seed?As the Fusang Tree continued to grow, Xun Chang'an discovered that this tree was not simple. The amount of Spirit Qi it gave birth to was already huge, and its yield exceeded all the other treasures on the mountain.Xun Chang'an wasn't stupid. Was such a treasure really from the Jade Pure Sect?When Li Qingzi passed by earlier, he was still very shocked.His master's background was far beyond his imagination.Han Jue observed the Fusang Tree for a while before returning to his cave abode.He had just broken through to the Body Integration Realm and was not in a hurry to cultivate.He took out the Book of Misfortune and prepared to curse Enlightened Old Monster.You dare to steal my companion and want to eradicate me for good?Making his mind, Six Paths spirit energy surged into the Book of Misfortune.\u2026The Formless Sect was a cultivation sect that had been passed down for nearly ten thousand years. It had deep foundations.The mountain gate was like a fairyland. There were continuous mountains and clouds. Rows of white cranes could be seen flying past. There were also oxen and horses galloping above the colorful clouds.There was a majestic waterfall between two ten thousand feet high peaks. At the bottom of the waterfall, a figure sat on the surface of the lake, enduring the terrifying impact of the waterfall. Strong winds swirled around him as if blades were slicing water.Enlightened Old Monster stood on the grass by the lake. He stroked his beard and looked over with a satisfied smile on his face.\"With Xian'er's potential, he will definitely be chosen by the Heavenly Immortal Manor.\"Enlightened Old Monster couldn't help but smile when he thought of his disciple, Dong Wangxian, stirring up trouble in the Heavenly Immortal Manor and eventually becoming a top-notch cultivator in the world or even ascending.His aptitude had already reached its limits, and it was very difficult for him to break through to the Tribulation Transcendence Realm. Thus, he placed his hopes on his disciple.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comAt this moment!Enlightened Old Monster's vitality suddenly became chaotic. His essence soul shook, and the world spun around him. His body swayed and he nearly fell.A mouthful of blood flowed down his throat. He couldn't help but spit it out.He hurriedly sat down and began to circulate his energy to heal his injuries.Under the waterfall, Dong Wangxian opened his eyes. Two beams of light shot out from his eyes, piercing through the water.He immediately stood up and appeared beside Enlightened Old Monster.In the light of the sun, Dong Wangxian stood bare-chested, his muscles clearly defined. He was not bloated or gaunt. He had an indescribable beauty to him. His features were angular, his eyebrows sharp, and his eyes bright. His wet black hair rose up steaming. Strands of black hair floated up and dried.Dong Wangxian frowned. \"Master, what's wrong?\"Enlightened Old Monster did not open his eyes. Instead, he gritted his teeth and said, \"Someone is cursing me!\"Enlightened Old Monster was a Body Integration Realm cultivator, after all. His knowledge was greater than that of Xiao'e, Daoist Calm Sky, and Demon King Dian Su.He understood his own cultivation very well. He couldn't have suffered such a heavy injury for no reason.Someone must be cursing him behind his back!Dong Wangxian frowned even harder and asked, \"Who could it be? Tell me, I'll go and kill him immediately!\"\"I'm not sure, either. I can't deduce the origins of this curse. You don't have to worry about it. Cultivate well and try to master the Mystical Power as soon as possible.\"After Enlightened Old Monster finished speaking, he did not say anything else and focused on healing his injuries.Dong Wangxian was about to leave when Enlightened Old Monster spat out another mouthful of blood.How strong is the enemy to be able to make a seventh-level Body Integration Realm cultivator suffer like this?Dong Wangxian was deep in thought.\u2026He cursed for half a day. When the system indicated danger, Han Jue stopped and started healing.Several days later, he recovered.\"That guy must be suffering.\"Han Jue thought proudly. Then, he returned to his cultivation.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comHe was no longer afraid of Enlightened Old Monster attacking him. After all, he was also at the Body Integration Realm.Han Jue first cultivated the seventh level of the Six Paths of Reincarnation Technique.The seventh level of the mental cultivation technique was much more profound than before. Cultivating it was also more complicated.Ten days later, Han Jue grasped it with his powerful aptitude and started to absorb Qi to increase his cultivation.Han Jue was pleasantly surprised to find that as his cultivation level increased, his cultivation speed didn't slow down. It was mainly because his potential also began to show.He breathed in the Spirit Qi of Heaven and Earth like a whale swallowing water and could feel his cultivation level increasing every day.Apart from his aptitude, it was also thanks to the Fusang Tree and the Spirit Qi that he had cultivated on this immortal mountain.Every once in a while, Li Qingzi would get someone to come to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain and plant even better natural treasures, causing the Spirit Qi to constantly increase.He wanted Han Jue to be unwilling to leave.Although Han Jue said that he didn't want to leave and was afraid that there would be too much trouble outside, Li Qingzi knew that once Han Jue felt that there was insufficient Spirit Qi here, he would definitely leave. It was the same for the founder back then.Cultivation was endless, and the seclusion of powerful cultivators took decades.In the blink of an eye, fifteen years passed quickly.Han Jue successfully broke through to the second level of the Body Integration Realm.He had already taken the pill that Xing Hongxuan had given him. That pill could actually strengthen his physique and increase his cultivation level.Han Jue had always been a Spirit Qi Cultivator. His spirit energy could allow him to kill enemies at a higher cultivation level, but the strength of his body was similar to those at the same cultivation level. Fortunately, he had many Numinous Treasures that could defend his body.After the breakthrough, Han Jue left the cave abode again.He walked in front of the Fusang Tree and stretched his muscles. The seed of the Earth Immortal Gourd had already started to grow vines that wrapped around the Fusang Tree like a green snake.It was still too early for the Earth Immortal Gourd to bloom and bear fruit. Han Jue only hoped that it could help strengthen the Spirit Qi here.As he stretched, he opened his interpersonal relationships to check his emails.After so many years, he wondered how his friends were doing.[Your pet, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, was attacked by beasts] x18928[Your disciple Su Qi was attacked by a fellow disciple] x76[Your disciple Su Qi has fallen into the abyss.

He didn't know, either.Han Jue probed the Fusang Tree with his divine sense but didn't sense the existence of an essence soul.If it became a spirit and developed intelligence, it would definitely have an essence soul.Han Jue decided to observe carefully.

Surrounded by clouds, it was as beautiful as a painting.Xuan Qingjun and a purple-robed woman sat by the lake. The purple-robed woman was the mighty figure who had saved Zhou Fan.\"Senior Sister, aren't you ascending?\" The purple-robed woman turned her head and asked.Xuan Qingjun didn't open her eyes as she replied, \"It's not time yet.\"The purple-robed woman clicked her tongue in wonder. \"I really don't understand all of you. You could've ascended at the Tribulation Transcendence Realm. Even now that you've reached the Mahayana Realm and have completely elevated your body, you can already do well in the Immortal Realm.

Senior Sister, you actually found a partner!\"The purple-robed woman's eyes widened. She immediately became interested and kept asking about him.Xuan Qingjun recalled the past and smiled. \"I wanted to see the sect Zhou Fan was from. I didn't expect to meet a kid that I liked. This kid is an ascetic. After so many years, he might have reached the Soul Formation realm.\"The purple-robed woman said in surprise, \"His potential isn't inferior to Zhou Fan's?\"\"Of course. I'll bring you to see him next time.\"Xuan Qingjun smiled when she mentioned Han Jue.Even after walking around the world, she found that Han Jue was still the most handsome man she had ever seen. His personality was also very likable.At this moment!The surface of the mirror quickly turned fiery red. The wind howled, and heat waves scattered the sea of clouds.Xuan Qingjun and the purple-robed woman immediately stood up. They looked down and saw a huge firebird with a wingspan of a thousand feet flying past.The purple-robed woman asked in astonishment, \"Divine Beast Zhu Dou? The legendary divine beast that represents calamity!\"Xuan Qingjun frowned. \"This Zhu Dou isn't mature yet, but it's already filled with the aura of misfortune. Something must be attracting it.\"\"Tsk tsk, I wonder which place is so unlucky to attract the Zhu Dou.\"\u2026Ever since he discovered that the Fusang Tree would shake every night, Han Jue began to feel uneasy.He felt that the tree would attract something.Could it be the legendary Golden Crow?Impossible!Isn't the Golden Crow hanging in the sky?The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comHe didn't see the sun getting lower!Han Jue paid attention. He didn't dare to focus on his cultivation.Several days later, Li Qingzi came to visit.After entering the cave abode, he sat on a chair and said with a smile, \"Elder Han, recently, the Jade Pure Sect has welcomed a joyous occasion. We discovered the ruins of an ancient sect with many resources inside. There are cultivation techniques, treasures, and even Dharma treasures. Do you want to take a look?\"Han Jue frowned and asked, \"Has this matter spread?\"If such an opportunity were to spread, it would definitely attract all the cultivators in the world.\"Of course not. This is a secret of the sect. Elder Guan has already brought five elders and a hundred core disciples to guard it. The teleportation formation is about to be set up. When the time comes, the disciples of the Jade Pure Sect can directly enter the ruins.\"Li Qingzi smiled proudly.Over the past few years, the Jade Pure Sect had been steadily developing. They did not provoke any enemies, and more and more itinerant cultivators joined the sect.Most of the cultivators in the cultivation world had forgotten about the Deity Slaying Elder, but the upper echelons of the various sects still remembered him. Therefore, they didn't dare to provoke the Jade Pure Sect or even stop its development.Han Jue nodded and said, \"That's good. I won't go. Be careful. Usually, this kind of ruins might have restrictions.\"\"I understand. If I find any treasure that can increase Spirit Qi, I'll get someone to send it over.\"\"Thank you, Sect Master. You're welcome.\"The two of them chatted briefly before Li Qingzi left in a hurry.Han Jue's mood improved.He was very satisfied with the peaceful strengthening of the Jade Pure Sect. The stronger the sect was, the more he could cultivate in seclusion in peace.Han Jue suddenly realized that Xun Chang'an was gone.He immediately used his divine sense to track him and discovered that he was in an inn in the inner sect city.Eh?\u2026In the northern part of Great Yan, flames appeared in the sky, illuminating it.The ice and snow on the ground melted at a speed visible to the naked eye.

He was shocked.\"That's\u2026 Zhu Dou! How is that possible!\"\"Oh no!\"Almost scared out of his wits, Dian Su immediately entered the cave abode. Mud rose from the cave entrance and quickly formed a mountain wall.The divine beast Zhu Dou spread its wings and flew over. It was like the legendary Golden Crow sweeping across the land.Wherever it passed, the ice melted, turning into a lake before evaporating into smoke.Zhu Dou was shaped like a firebird. It had a head like a dog and three legs. Its claws were different from that of a ferocious bird and more like dragon claws. The overall appearance made it look extremely powerful and unstoppable.The thousands of miles of snow melted under its heat!Its eyes glowed like torches as it looked in the direction of the Jade Pure Sect!\u2026Jade Pure Sect, Inner Sect Inn.In the guest room, Xun Chang'an sat at the table with a wine cup in his hand. He smiled and said, \"Qian'er, how do you feel about coming to the Jade Pure Sect? I've already joined the sect for decades. If you encounter any trouble, you can look for me anytime.\"He looked at a graceful woman by the window.She was dressed in green. Her long hair reached her waist and her skin was fair and beautiful. Although she was not so beautiful that she could cause the downfall of a city, she was still a rare beauty.The woman called Qian'er tucked her hair behind her ear and said, \"Chang'an, you don't have to treat me like this. It's really impossible between us. Perhaps you're doing well in the Jade Pure Sect, but I can't give myself to you for the sake of benefits.\"Xun Chang'an's heart ached when he heard this. He gritted his teeth and said, \"Why? Because of my looks? I can put on a handsome face.\"Qian'er turned around and looked at him. Her beautiful eyes were filled with dissatisfaction as she said, \"What is real is real. What is fake will always be fake.

It was so strong?He didn't know if there was a power difference between the Mahayana Realm and the Grand Unity Earth Immortal Realm. Regardless, they weren't existences Han Jue could fight against.But why would the Vermilion Bird only seek revenge after he ascended?Could it be that it couldn't descend into the mortal world?Very likely!Perhaps this was an immortal rule.It seemed that if he wanted to ascend in the future, he had to at least be stronger than the Vermilion Bird. Otherwise, it would be very dangerous.Han Jue thought as he silently took out the Book of Misfortune.He wondered if the book could curse a divine beast.Han Jue cursed for a while but didn't suffer any backlash. It seemed to work.He decided that in the future, while cultivating, he would curse Enlightened Old Monster and the Vermilion Bird!The next morning, Xun Chang'an returned to the Fusang Tree in a daze.Last night, he got drunk at the inn. The wine of the Jade Pure Sect was unordinary. Cultivators could also get drunk after drinking it.This drunkenness caused Xun Chang'an to fall completely into the love tribulation.Han Jue came out of the cave abode and stopped in front of him.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comXun Chang'an was in a trance and didn't notice his arrival.Han Jue frowned and couldn't help but recall Xun Chang'an's background.The Ancient Spiritual Ginseng had reincarnated. In the previous life, it was nurtured by the Buddhists. Due to its fate with the demoness, it fell into a trap of love. The gods and Buddhas were furious and threw it into the mortal world to experience the tribulations of love.Only by completely forgetting itself and severing emotions would it be able to escape the pain of reincarnation. This was the thirty-ninth life. Xun Chang'an was born into a cultivation family and was extremely talented. However, he was ugly and was not liked by Qian'er. After being rejected by her many times, he was heartbroken and ended up becoming a monk.Han Jue used his divine sense to capture the scene of Xun Chang'an and Qian'er talking. That scene\u2026He was basically a simp.No.That was a modern term on the Internet. Here, it was called deep affection.One-sided deep affection.Han Jue didn't know how to persuade Xun Chang'an.This was a love tribulation. How could he persuade him with words?Han Jue called out, \"Disciple.\"Xun Chang'an was stunned for a moment. When he saw him, he slowly got up and knelt in front of Han Jue. His emotions suddenly erupted and he cried, \"Master! I feel so bitter\u2026\"For some reason, Han Jue thought of Zhu Bajie.The two had the same trait.They were both ugly.Han Jue sighed and said, \"Disciple, relationships between men and women are bitter. This is the reason why I have been in seclusion.\"\"But why\u2026 why would so many beauties come to you of their own accord? I only like one woman, but she\u2026\"Xun Chang'an cried bitterly.Halfway up the mountain, a sleeping Black Hell Chicken rolled over.\"Idiot, can't you cultivate properly\u2026\" It harrumphed. After eating the Zhu Dou, it could clearly feel its bloodline transforming. Excited, it felt that it would become very strong.It even began to look forward to the Chaotic Heavenly Dog's return to challenge it.Oh, doggy!I'll let you know how powerful your father is!New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.comOn the other side, faced with Xun Chang'an's question, Han Jue said calmly, \"It's only because I'm powerful. In this world, the strong are respected. If your cultivation is the best in the world, how can that woman not fall in love with you? Your cultivation is average and you don't look good. What does she want from you? Your sincerity?\"Sincerity is the most worthless thing in the world!\"Cultivate the Heartless Flying Sword I taught you. This technique can help you become the number one in the world!\"Hearing this, Xun Chang'an looked up. His face that was covered in snot and tears became even uglier. Han Jue almost turned his head away in disgust.He suddenly understood Qian'er.However, all of this was the fault of the gods and Buddhas. They deliberately made Xun Chang'an look so ugly.Han Jue had tried to change Xun Chang'an's appearance, but he quickly recovered his ugly face. It was very strange.Xun Chang'an's eyes widened. \"Really?\"\"Why would I lie to you?\"If someone else said this, Xun Chang'an would definitely not believe them. But since it was Han Jue, he believed him.Currently, Han Jue was indeed the strongest existence he knew.Thinking of Xing Hongxuan's attitude towards Han Jue, Xun Chang'an was immediately ignited.Heartless Flying Sword! I must cultivate it until the end!Han Jue didn't say much. Some words were meaningless.What he said was not entirely true.Humans were very \"contradictory\" existences. When they were weak, they would look down on sincerity and only want to become stronger. But when they were strong, they would pursue sincerity.Han Jue went down the mountain to find the Black Hell Chicken. After confirming that it was fine, he returned to the Connate Cave Abode.After being hated by the Vermilion Bird, Han Jue felt a sense of urgency again.Although the bird couldn't come down now, what if it could come down in the future?He had to hurry up and become stronger.\u2026Three years later.The matter of the Divine Beast Zhu Dou attacking the Jade Pure Sect had been settled. Very few people in the sect talked about it, but it caused a commotion in the cultivation world.When the Zhu Dou swept up the Great Yan, the scene was very impactful. Many people saw it.New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.comThere were also scouts from various sects in the Jade Pure Sect. When they learned that the Zhu Dou had been insta-killed by the Deity Slaying Elder, they were so frightened that they didn't dare to have any ill intentions. They could only try to befriend the Jade Pure Sect and try not to incur any grudges.There were no demon spies in the sect. The intelligence of the scouts from the various sects was not made known to the public. Therefore, the Zhu Dou's death was a secret that the demons couldn't find out.Demon King Dian Su was very curious about where the Zhu Dou had gone. Could it be related to the Jade Pure Sect?This was the first time Dian Su feared the Jade Pure Sect.This sect was not simple!On this day, Li Qingzi came to visit Han Jue.He came in front of him. Before he could speak, Han Jue said, \"Don't look for me regarding the fortuitous encounter. I won't go!\"Li Qingzi coughed and said, \"I didn't bring good news.\"Han Jue frowned and opened his eyes.Li Qingzi sighed and said, \"The Blood Fire Heavenly Sect of Great Wei and the Formless Sect of Guyuan State have started a war. These two sects are huge entities, with Great Yan and the West Abyss State in the middle. Once the war begins, our two states will very likely be engulfed.\"Han Jue was speechless. They could fight despite being so far apart?Were they so free?Speaking of which, these two sects had a hidden grudge with Han Jue.\"It's said that the prodigy of the Formless Sect, Dong Wangxian, killed the son of the sect master of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect. The Blood Fire Heavenly Sect is in a state of high morale, so how could they tolerate it? They immediately started fighting. That Body Integration Realm guest elder has already taken the lead in attacking the Formless Sect.\"Li Qingzi's tone was filled with envy.When would the Jade Pure Sect have a Body Integration Realm mighty figure!No.He would be satisfied with more Void Amalgamation and Soul Formation Realm experts.Han Jue said, \"It's fine. Let them fight each other. As long as they don't threaten the Jade Pure Sect. If they want to destroy us along the way, you can rest assured with me around.\"Now, Han Jue's enemy was already the Vermilion Bird. What were the Formless Sect and the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect in comparison?\"In addition, an old blind man appeared in the ruins of the ancient sect we discovered previously. His abilities are unfathomable. We wanted to rope him in, but he never agreed. He's currently staying in the inner sect city. Elder Han, do you think\u2026 you can help us convince him?\" Li Qingzi said in embarrassment, feeling a little ashamed.If he wanted to poach someone, he still needed the Deity Slaying Elder. He was indeed not capable enough.Upon hearing this, Han Jue immediately checked the strongest person in the sect other than himself.[Xiao Yao: Ninth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm.

It's said to be a large sect from five thousand years ago. However, it offended the Immortal Gods and misfortune befell them from the heavens. The entire sect was annihilated. Elder Han, why are you asking about the Spiritual Firmament Sect? Could it be that the ruins we found are from this sect?\"Han Jue nodded. \"I made some deductions. This person's name is Xiao Yao, and he's from the Spiritual Firmament Sect.\"Li Qingzi's eyes widened and he gasped.He had never heard of Xiao Yao, but he had heard of the Spiritual Firmament Sect.\"What do we do now? Abandon the ruins?\" Li Qingzi asked cautiously.He was afraid they would find trouble for no reason. He only hoped that the Jade Pure Sect could develop peacefully. As long as the sect was given time, it would grow stronger sooner or later and become a large sect like the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect and the Formless Sect.Han Jue replied, \"It's up to you. If it's easy to be punished by the heavens, it should have come long ago. I think that as long as the Spiritual Firmament Sect doesn't reappear in the world, the treasures are safe.\"Li Qingzi nodded. It would be difficult for him to give up the resources. After all, the elders had already divided up a lot.\"Forget about Xiao Yao for the time being. Just continue with life. We can't force a horse to drink water, after all,\" Han Jue added.Li Qingzi had no objections. Hearing that Xiao Yao was from the Spiritual Firmament Sect, his first reaction was to expel him.But on second thought, he couldn't defeat him. How could he expel him?Then, Li Qingzi left.Han Jue began to use the simulation trial against Xiao Yao.Ten seconds later.Han Jue opened his eyes and looked surprised.\"This fellow is something. His Mystical Power is too evasive,\" Han Jue muttered.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comXiao Yao could split into tens of thousands of clones, so Han Li could not kill him immediately.He was considered powerful since he could last ten seconds under him.Han Jue continued the simulation trial.He wanted to find a way to kill Xiao Yao.It felt like he was looking for a strategy to kill monsters. Han Jue was happy.Five minutes later, he finally found a way to kill Xiao Yao as soon as possible.However, as soon as the fight started, Xiao Yao used his cloning technique.After understanding his strength, Han Jue became more interested in him.If such an expert joined the Jade Pure Sect, he would be able to cultivate in peace.Then, Han Jue opened the emails.[Your disciple Su Qi was captured by the Devil Master.][Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck.

It looked like the war between the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect and the Formless Sect had already begun.Su Qi and Yang Tiandong also encountered trouble.Han Jue wasn't worried about Su Qi at all.As for Yang Tiandong, it was obvious that he had left the Great Yan. No demon in the Great Yan would dare to attack the demon king's adopted son.For more, visit lightnovelworld.comThe Chaotic Heavenly Dog had suffered retribution. It hadn't been beaten recently, so it was likely hiding somewhere to recuperate.He hoped that it would come to its senses and return soon.Han Jue shook his head and laughed, then continued cultivating.At the second level of the Body Integration Realm, Han Jue was no longer afraid of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect and the Formless Sect. However, even if he was not in danger, he had to worry about the future.Han Jue was afraid that the Vermilion Bird would break into the mortal world at any time. He had to hurry up and cultivate. He couldn't slack off.\u2026Deep in a dark valley, Su Qi sat in a corner nervously looking at a figure in the distance.The person was surrounded by demonic Qi. His face was frightening and covered in blood-colored scales. It was ghastly and terrifying.Su Qi gritted his teeth. \"Devil Master, I'm only a mortal. Please let me go!\"The Devil Master kept his eyes closed as he meditated.Su Qi was angry but didn't dare to say anything.After a while, the Devil Master said leisurely, \"Kid, if I wanted to kill you, you would already be dead. The fact that you're still alive means this is a fortuitous encounter for you. Just wait patiently.\"Fortuitous encounter?Su Qi widened his eyes and carefully said, \"You want to teach me your ultimate technique?\"He was excited. Was this a blessing in disguise?\"Perhaps. I can't read your fate, which shows that you have extraordinary providence. Perhaps you can inherit my legacy. If I can't fulfill my wish in the future, I'll hand it to you,\" the Devil Master replied nonchalantly.Su Qi asked, \"What wish?\"\"Massacre the humans.\"Su Qi was stunned.As expected of the Devil Master!If that's the case, then I'll hide here and find a chance to kill him! Su Qi thought silently.He had always thought of himself as a kind person. Back then, he had joined the Jade Pure Sect because he thought that it was a righteous sect.He even felt that Han Jue had sent him to hide in the Demon Taming Sect because he wanted to enforce justice on behalf of the heavens. After joining it, he discovered that this sect was indeed cruel, evil, and that the heavens did not tolerate it.Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.Su Qi took a deep breath, his eyes becoming determined.No matter what, Master must be secretly protecting me. I can't let him down.\u2026Time passed quickly.Ten years passed in the blink of an eye.Han Jue was still a little short of the third level of the Body Integration Realm. He originally planned to break through to the third level in one go before resting, but the Fusang Tree started shaking again.The previous time, it had attracted the Divine Beast Zhu Dou. What would it attract this time?Han Jue couldn't help but tense up.This couldn't go on.What should he do?He suddenly thought of the Black Hell Chicken.If the chicken occupied the Fusang Tree, would the other beasts and divine beasts not come anymore?Han Jue immediately instructed the Black Hell Chicken to move to the Fusang Tree.After eating the Zhu Dou, the Black Hell Chicken's cultivation had already soared to the ninth level of the Soul Formation Realm. It was only a step away from the Void Amalgamation Realm.This was simply cheating!However, on careful thought, it made sense. The Zhu Dou might be a divine beast, but the Black Hell Chicken was a reincarnated Demon Saint of the Upper World.After receiving the order, the Black Hell Chicken did not resist and was even excited. It quickly flew to the Fusang Tree and sat on the trunk like a rooster hatching an egg.A few days later, when the Fusang Tree stopped shaking, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.He was about to continue cultivating when he suddenly sensed an aura. It was at the bottom of the mountain, sitting in front of the stone tablet that had formed the immortal mountain.It was the blind Xiao Yao!Han Jue thought for a moment and asked with a voice transmission, \"What's the matter, Fellow Daoist?\"Xiao Yao's hair was white, but his face was very young. He seemed to be in his thirties. His eyelids were black and shriveled. He was wearing a tattered Daoist robe and leaning against the stone tablet as if he was napping.Upon hearing Han Jue's voice transmission, he stretched lazily, slowly stood up, and said, \"Your Sect Master has always been inviting me to join the sect. I've stayed in the Jade Pure Sect for a period of time. You're the strongest Deity Slaying Elder, right? I don't mind joining the sect.

Now that he heard it from the other party, he felt inexplicably uncomfortable.Not afraid of fighting, he sent a voice transmission, \"The two of us will go up to the sky and give it a go.\"With that said, he flew out of the Connate Cave Abode and arrived above the sea of clouds.Xiao Yao appeared in front of Han Jue.Without another word, Han Jue poured the Six Paths spirit energy into all the Numinous Treasures on his body. In an instant, a strong light burst out from his body, making him look like an immortal descending to the mortal world. It was dazzling.Xiao Yao was blind, but his divine sense was still there. It didn't matter if he had eyes or not.\"So many Numinous Treasures\u2026\"Xiao Yao frowned. He suddenly developed an interest in the Jade Pure Sect.This person definitely had a method to hide his cultivation level. He couldn't be only at the ninth level of the Foundation Establishment Realm.Xiao Yao raised his palm and said, \"Since you're wearing so many Numinous Treasures, I won't hold back. I'll use my full strength.\"How cautious!He was at the ninth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm but still wanted to use his full strength. Was he sparring or killing?Han Jue ridiculed him in his heart but appeared calm on the surface. He said, \"If I receive it, are you really willing to join the Jade Pure Sect and listen to the Sect Master? Don't play word games.\"Xiao Yao said, \"I never go back on my word. I do need a place to stay. The Jade Pure Sect has given me a good impression.\"Han Jue nodded and waited for him to strike.Xiao Yao raised his right hand, and the wind above the sea of clouds stopped. A murderous aura filled the air.Although Xiao Yao was blind, he clearly felt that Han Jue was fearless.Xiao Yao really intended to hit with all his might.He suddenly waved his palm and hit Han Jue's chest.Boom\u2014The sea of clouds beneath their feet scattered. Xiao Yao was startled. He felt a strong rebound of spirit energy.This content is taken from lightnovelworld.comCaught off guard, he was forced back.At the second level of the Body Integration Realm, Han Jue couldn't possibly lose to Xiao Yao, who was at the ninth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm!In order to give him an opening gambit, Han Jue deliberately used all his strength. As Xiao Yao retreated, his blood surged and he couldn't help spitting out a mouthful of blood.Shocked, Xiao Yao gritted his teeth. \"Body Integration Realm!\"Unexpectedly, there was actually a Body Integration Realm cultivator hidden in the sect which had a Nascent Soul Realm cultivator as its sect master!He had thought that the strongest cultivator in the Jade Pure Sect was only at the Soul Formation Realm. And a weak one at that.A sect that did not even have a Void Amalgamation Realm cultivator actually had a Body Integration Realm cultivator hiding within it!Xiao Yao steadied himself and took a deep breath. \"From now on, I'm a member of the Jade Pure Sect!\"[Xiao Yao has a good impression of you. Current favorability: 1 star.]He has a good impression of me already?It seemed that this person was quite tactful.Satisfied, Han Jue said, \"Don't tell anyone about my cultivation.\"Xiao Yao was surprised. \"The sect doesn't know?\"\"Yes. With my cultivation level, it would be too weird for me to stay in the sect. I'm also worried that the sect will cause trouble. Other than longevity, I have no desires, so I've been cultivating diligently,\" Han Jue explained.Xiao Yao couldn't help but think highly of him.\"That's all. Go find the Sect Master. He will arrange a position for you.\" Han Jue smiled.With that, he vanished.Xiao Yao remained in the air and thought for a long time. He then sighed and flew towards the sect's main peak.When he returned to the entrance of the cave abode, the Fusang Tree's Black Hell Chicken called out, \"Master, why didn't you teach him a lesson? He's too arrogant! Shouldn't you strike back with your sword?\"Xun Chang'an's cultivation was inferior to the chicken, so he didn't know what had just happened.Han Jue glanced at the Black Hell Chicken and said, \"I'll give you a strike. Do you dare to take it?\"This chicken is a little too arrogant now. No, I have to suppress it. I have to maintain its image. The cautious chicken cannot lose its way!Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experienceThe Black Hell Chicken shook its head in fear.Han Jue turned to look at the chicken and said with a voice transmission, \"This person is hated by the Immortal Gods. Do you see his eyes? That's the outcome of the Immortal God's curse.\"The Black Hell Chicken's eyes widened.Immortal God's curse!\"It's just so dangerous outside. Don't get too arrogant. You ate the Zhu Dou. Do you know where it came from? It's the son of the divine beast, the Vermilion Bird. That being from the upper world has already set its eyes on you. You have to work hard to cultivate and become stronger so as to prevent the Vermilion Bird from taking revenge. I've deduced that it already hates you and me, so I have to cultivate in seclusion.\"Han Jue continued to transmit his voice. This time, the Black Hell Chicken was completely terrified.Vermilion Bird!Gasp\u2014The Black Hell Chicken suddenly felt nauseous, but even if it wanted to vomit, it could not.Han Jue was satisfied when he saw its reaction.He returned to the Connate Cave Abode and began cultivating.Xun Chang'an was baffled to see the Black Hell Chicken trembling.The next day, the Jade Pure Sect announced a new elder, an elder at the Void Amalgamation Realm!The entire sect was excited.This was a realm that only the founder had reached!Xiao Yao's name spread throughout the sect.Apart from being happy, Li Qingzi was even more respectful towards Han Jue.Xiao Yao was not Han Jue's match even though he was so strong. Most importantly, there was no movement in their fight.What did that mean?It meant that Han Jue was far stronger than Xiao Yao, so the sparring didn't last long.Elder Han was the true pillar of the sect!With this in mind, Li Qingzi immediately met with the elders and informed them one by one to not ignore Han Jue because they wanted to curry favor with Xiao Yao.New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.comHan Jue's demand was still the top priority of the Jade Pure Sect!Nobody could afford to be negligent!\u2026Five years passed very quickly, but the Great Yan was in turmoil.The Blood Fire Heavenly Sect of Great Wei bypassed the Great Yan and attacked the Formless Sect of Guyuan State. Both were super sects with deep foundations.Before the unification of the Great Wei, the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect had been extremely powerful, causing the surrounding cultivation world to tremble in fear.However, when the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect faced the Formless Sect, the battle situation made everyone's jaws drop.The Blood Fire Heavenly Sect had been completely demolished by the Formless Sect. Their Body Integration Realm guest was severely injured and was hiding somewhere to recuperate.Meanwhile, the Formless Sect advanced toward the Great Wei. They came in menacingly and wanted to destroy the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect.All the sects of the cultivation world were trembling.The battle between the two colossi affected many sects.Truly, the fight between the big shots implicated the small fishes.Inside the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect, Daoist Calm Sky and Sect Master Liu Bumie were talking in a pavilion.Liu Bumie's face was pale. Facing the powerful Formless Sect, he, the sect master, could not hold on much longer.If the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect was destroyed, how would he answer to his ancestors?Daoist Calm Sky sighed and said, \"Even that guest elder escaped. We can't defeat the Formless Sect.\"Liu Bumie gritted his teeth. \"Then, what should we do? We're already mortal enemies. Surrendering is not an option!\"The Blood Fire Heavenly Sect had become a joke in the cultivation world. After all, they had been so arrogant before.Daoist Calm Sky's eyes flickered. \"Actually, we can submit to other sects. As long as we can guarantee the preservation of our own legacy, it's not strange for us to be a subsidiary force in the cultivation world.\"\"I've thought about it, but the sects around the Great Wei are even weaker than our Blood Fire Heavenly Sect. The powerful sects that can contend against the Formless Sect are too far away from us.\"The more Liu Bumie spoke, the more miserable his expression became.Even the heavens wanted the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect to perish!New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.com\"We can seek refuge with the Jade Pure Sect.\" Daoist Calm Sky narrowed his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Fusang Tree and the Earth Immortal Gourd were both growing quite well. With their help, the Spirit Qi of the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain kept increasing steadily.Han Jue was satisfied. It was indeed a divine tree. Its vitality was much stronger than other treasures.Ever since the Black Hell Chicken occupied the Fusang Tree, it had not swayed under the night sky. Not to mention divine beasts, even ordinary beasts had not been summoned.Out of habit, Han Jue opened his interpersonal relationships to check his emails.[Your pet, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, was attacked by beasts] x5877[Your pet, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog, was severely injured and was on the brink of death.

His divinity is awakening.]\u2026Han Jue was speechless.Really?!What was the Chaotic Heavenly Dog doing?He had been beaten up again. He had only just recovered from his severe injuries and was severely injured again. Fortunately, he was a divine beast of providence. If it were anyone else, they would have long died.Mo Fuchou and Zhou Fan should still be together. The number of times they had been beaten was very close. Based on Han Jue and Zhou Fan's understanding, the one who had caused trouble was definitely Zhou Fan.Famous people were always unwilling to be ordinary. Perhaps this was fate.Han Jue noticed that Fairy Xi Xuan had obtained another fortuitous encounter.Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experienceIn the past few decades, Fairy Xi Xuan had been training outside. Her cultivation level had also been increasing and there was hope of her breaking through to the Soul Formation realm.As the Jade Pure Sect grew stronger, most of the elders' cultivation levels began to increase. This was a good thing.Xiao Yao was cursed by the Immortal Gods once a year. What was wrong with him?Han Jue was suddenly worried. Would Xiao Yao bring trouble to the Jade Pure Sect?As for Su Qi, his divinity had just begun to awaken?His bad luck was already terrifying enough. How exaggerated would it be after awakening?Han Jue suddenly felt that it was the right thing to send Su Qi away. If he stayed in the Jade Pure Sect for too long, he would harm it sooner or later.But speaking of which, Su Qi's life was actually quite tragic. The people around him would always die because of him, and he didn't know his previous life's identity. It was very likely that he felt the heavens were targeting him.Han Jue suspected the intentions of the Heavenly Court that wanted him to descend to the mortal world.On second thought, with a calamity divine beast like the Zhu Dou in the mortal world, it wasn't surprising even if a jinx appeared.It was precisely because of existences like the Zhu Dou and the Jinx that extremists like Thanos did not appear.Perhaps this was the deeper meaning of the Heavenly Court.Han Jue guessed.Immediately, he took out the Book of Misfortune and began to curse Enlightened Old Monster and the Vermilion Bird. He took turns cursing them for five days.At the same time, on the main peak, Li Qingzi, the Grand Elder, Xiao Yao, and the other elders gathered in the hall.They all looked at someone. This person was from the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect. His name was Perfected Yan Lin. He was a Void Amalgamation Realm cultivator and was an elder.Perfected Yan Lin was secretly puzzled.They're so weak?Apart from Xiao Yao, everyone else was no threat to him.He didn't understand why the Sect Master wanted to go under the Jade Pure Sect. Even so, he still spoke honestly.The Blood Fire Heavenly Sect was already at the edge of the cliff, they could only try their best.After he finished speaking, everyone looked at each other. Clearly, they did not expect the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect to want to join the Jade Pure Sect.For more, visit lightnovelworld.comLi Qingzi frowned and said, \"Your sect and the Formless Sect are in a huge battle. The Jade Pure Sect doesn't want to be involved in trouble.\"He didn't have a good impression of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect. In his opinion, they wanted to drag his sect down with them.\"Our Sect Master said that if the Jade Pure Sect agrees, the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect can even directly join you and become the nineteenth peak of the Jade Pure Sect.\"Li Qingzi couldn't help but look at the Grand Elder. The master and disciple looked at each other and saw temptation in each other's expressions.After the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect swallowed the Great Wei, their foundation was already very strong. If the Jade Pure Sect could swallow them, they would definitely soar.Li Qingzi stood up and said, \"You guys chat first. I'll go out for a while.\"With that, he flew out of the hall.The elders all understood where he was going. He was definitely going to find the Deity Slaying Elder.Xiao Yao suddenly took a step forward and said, \"I don't know much about the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect. You and I are both elders. Why don't we spar and learn each other's strength?\"Perfected Yan Lin narrowed his eyes. \"Alright!\"He was also very unconvinced and felt that the Jade Pure Sect was not worthy of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect seeking refuge under them.\u2026Li Qingzi found Han Jue and explained the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect's purpose.\"Elder Han, what do you think?\" Li Qingzi asked.Han Jue frowned as he thought of the Formless Sect.Accepting the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect would definitely offend the Formless Sect. However, the Formless Sect's Sect Master, Enlightened Old Monster, was his enemy, so he was not afraid of offending him.Enlightened Old Monster was at the seventh level of the Body Integration Realm. At the third level of Body Integration Realm, Han Jue was definitely not afraid of him.However, Enlightened Old Monster was not alone.\"Are you confident in resisting the Formless Sect?\" Han Jue asked.Li Qingzi sighed and said, \"The Formless Sect also seems to be targeting us. Their disciples have already entered the Great Yan. The various righteous sects of the Great Yan have also sent us letters asking for help.\"Han Jue raised his eyebrows.Was Enlightened Old Monster coming after him?Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceBoom\u2014An earth-shattering sound came from outside. Han Jue scanned with his divine sense. It was Xiao Yao and Perfected Yan Lin fighting.Xiao Yao was at the ninth level of the Void Amalgamation Realm, so Perfected Yan Lin was no match for him.Han Jue said calmly, \"In other words, we actually don't have a choice. Even if we reject the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect, the Formless Sect can still overturn the cultivation world of the Great Yan?\"Li Qingzi nodded helplessly.Han Jue said in a low voice, \"How about this? When Perfected Yan Lin loses, tell him to go back and ask his sect master and Daoist Calm Sky to come personally.\"Li Qingzi was pleasantly surprised that Elder Han was going to make a move.If they wanted to annex the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect, they had to suppress them completely. After all, the difference in strength between the two sides was too great. Even if they were to unite, the Jade Pure Sect might not be able to hold them down in the future.Li Qingzi left immediately.The battle between Xiao Yao and Perfected Yan Lin lasted for five minutes, which was an eye-opener for the disciples of the Jade Pure Sect.Elder Xiao was so powerful!When Xiao Yao used his 10,000 clones, there was no longer any suspense in the battle. Perfected Yan Lin was completely suppressed.Li Qingzi told Perfected Yan Lin what Han Jue said and he quickly left.Inside the Connate Cave Abode.Han Jue touched his chin and muttered, \"No, since I can't do the simulation with Enlightened Old Monster, I don't know his strength. What if he has a special secret technique or Mystical Power?\"Once the battle started, Han Jue had to kill Enlightened Old Monster and not let him escape like Daoist Calm Sky.Han Jue thought of his Six Paths Insignia.In the future, should he leave the Six Paths Insignia on the enemy first?This way, no matter where the other party fled, Han Jue would be able to catch him.In this case, Han Jue would have to strengthen the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger to the extreme.At that time, he would directly shoot at the enemy from his Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain!Just as Han Jue was thinking, a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experience[Detected bearer of Connate providence, checking its origin.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Han Jue was stunned.It had been a long time since he met a new Connate providence bearer.He immediately chose to check.[Murong Qi: Fourth level of the Golden Core Realm, reincarnated War God of the Upper Realm Divine Palace. His title is Profound Truth Divine Emperor. He was attacked by the Immortal Emperors of the demon race. His physical body was destroyed. His soul entered the cycle of reincarnation and came to the mortal world. In the cycle of reincarnation, his soul slowly recovered. Due to the providence of the Divine Emperor, even as a mortal, his talent was unparalleled. Unconsciously, he was attracted by the Ancient Spiritual Ginseng and came to the Jade Pure Sect.]Han Jue was stunned.Divine Palace War God?Profound Truth Divine Emperor?What level was the Divine Palace?How was it compared to the Heavenly Court?Han Jue suddenly felt that the Upper Realm was different from what he imagined. It seemed the Heavenly Court wasn't the sole dominant force. There might be many powerful factions, and their relationships were very deep.Heavenly Court, Divine Palace, Buddha\u2014these were the ones he knew of.On second thought, it made sense. If not for him being able to detect the Connate providence, he probably wouldn't have noticed these incredible existences.In novels, the protagonist would also encounter various geniuses, but he wouldn't be able to see through their origins.Although Murong Qi was the reincarnation of Profound Truth Divine Emperor, if he was killed in this life, it wouldn't affect him much. Even if he regained his identity as Profound Truth Divine Emperor, he wouldn't seek revenge.God knew how many times Murong Qi had reincarnated. Just like Xun Chang'an, who was already at the 39th reincarnation, when he ascended to the Upper Realm in the future, he couldn't possibly take revenge on his enemies from every lifetime.Each lifetime had its own enemies and grudges.The Ancient Spiritual Ginseng\u2014who was the current Xun Chang'an\u2014had attracted the attention of Profound Truth Divine Emperor. Would he attract other people with powerful backgrounds in the future?Xun Chang'an wasn't Zhu Bajie, but simply Tang Seng himself!Han Jue used his divine sense to search for him.Murong Qi and a group of cultivators were flying towards the Jade Pure Sect. The leader was Guan Yougang.These cultivators were not wearing the Daoist robes of the Jade Pure Sect. They had probably just been recruited.Han Jue's attention landed on Murong Qi.Looking youthful, he looked to be only fifteen or sixteen years old. He had probably taken the Youth Retaining Pill earlier.Han Jue didn't think too much about it. Even if Murong Qi wanted to eat the Ancient Spiritual Ginseng, he wouldn't succeed as a Golden Core cultivator.Besides\u2026The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comXun Chang'an was so ugly, who would have the appetite to eat him?Han Jue started to think hard about how to make the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger stronger.As he passed by the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain, Murong Qi suddenly asked, \"Is this mountain also from the Jade Pure Sect?\"The others were also watching because the Spirit Qi in this mountain was extremely abundant.\"Yes, this is the Jade Pure Sect's Deity Slaying Elder's mountain. In the future, you are not allowed to trespass. Otherwise, you will be expelled from the sect.\" Guan Yougang nodded. He looked at the immortal mountain with reverence.\"It's here. What I seek must be on this mountain,\" Murong Qi thought silently.Since birth, he had an extraordinary intuition that could help him find many fortuitous encounters.He had been to the outer sect of the Jade Pure Sect before. Now, the sect was famous in Great Yan. He didn't dare to barge in, so he found the place where the sect specially recruited individual cultivators and signed up to join.\"Is Deity Slaying Elder accepting disciples?\" Murong Qi asked.Guan Yougang snorted. \"Well, yes, but we can't disturb him. Previously, a monk knelt on the mountain for five years before succeeding.\"The itinerant cultivators were shocked upon hearing this.Kneel for five years?Such determination!Murong Qi took this matter to heart.The group moved around the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain and flew to the main peak.Under the Fusang Tree.Xun Chang'an suddenly opened his eyes. He patted his chest, secretly puzzled.\"Why do I feel uneasy\u2026\"This was the first time he felt this way. Was he possessed?Xun Chang'an couldn't help but become nervous. He checked his cultivation technique to see if he had practiced it wrong.\u2026Two months later.The sky was filled with purple light again, shocking the world.Again?That's right!Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceWith his top-notch Sword Dao comprehension, Han Jue entered the Sword Dao River again. The world also produced strange phenomena.The Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger, although a finger technique, was essentially a sword technique. It was very similar to the Unparalleled Finger Divine Sword. Using the finger as a sword, it shot out sword Qi.He came to the Sword Dao River again and looked at the figures that he had surpassed one by one. Han Jue wasn't surprised but rather nervous.Would he encounter that mysterious existence again?Not able to control his consciousness, Han Jue could only watch.The Sword Dao River was bright. Han Jue vaguely saw some memories of the sword cultivators, but they flashed past and he didn't see them clearly.After a while, a figure in front suddenly stopped.Han Jue's heart skipped a beat.It was the same guy again!Doesn't he cultivate? Is he always guarding the Sword Dao River?The figure was covered in sword light, making it difficult to see his true appearance. He turned to look at Han Jue and said, \"It's you again!\"Han Jue said carefully, \"I'm already at the Grand Unity area? I didn't mean to offend you, but I can't stop myself. Help me stop. Just don't hurt me.\"The mysterious sword cultivator was silent.An invisible force made him unable to move forward.Han Jue waited nervously.\"Strange, you don't have an illustrious identity from your previous life. How can you have such Sword Dao comprehension?\" the mysterious sword cultivator asked in surprise.Han Jue answered, \"Everything has a beginning. Perhaps I will become someone's illustrious past life identity in the future.\"The mysterious sword cultivator did not reply.Three breaths later, the mysterious sword cultivator waved his hand and said, \"The profundity of Grand Unity is not something that ordinary people can touch. Be careful not to suffer a backlash. Go back.\"Boom!Han Jue felt dizzy.He opened his eyes again and saw that he had returned to the Connate Cave Abode.Han Jue touched his chin as he wondered. Why did he keep meeting that fellow? Did he have nothing to do all day?Han Jue began the simulation trial and raised Xiao Yao's cultivation level to the third level of the Body Integration Realm.With the enhanced Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger, Han Jue instantly killed him.Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comWhat a pity.Xiao Yao was still a little weak. Han Jue suddenly wished that a ninth-stage Body Integration Realm cultivator could sneak into the Jade Pure Sect. Only then could he verify how powerful his Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger was.At the same time, the phenomenon in the sky disappeared.However, the discussions of the cultivation world and dynasties did not stop.In the cultivation world, even powerful cultivators of the older generation stood up and said that a golden age of geniuses was coming!This was the third heavenly phenomenon so far!In the eyes of the cultivators, it was impossible for all three times to be because of the same person.As a result, Han Jue alone set off a golden age of geniuses and elites!Han Jue quickly entered cultivation.A year later, someone appeared in front of the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain and knelt in front of the stone tablet.It was none other than the reincarnation of Profound Truth Divine Emperor, Murong Qi.After staying in the Jade Pure Sect for a year, Murong Qi had not thought of a way to ascend the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. However, every time he looked at it, his heart would throb. It caused him to have a strong urge to go up the mountain. In the end, he decided to follow Guan Yougang's method to become a disciple.He had to sneak into the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain first!Murong Qi knelt in front of the stone tablet and began to kowtow.Han Jue was focused on cultivation and didn't notice him.Xun Chang'an noticed him very quickly. After all, Murong Qi had followed his example.After Murong Qi knelt for a month, Xun Chang'an descended the mountain and stood in the array formation, smiling at him.This person looks pretty good, Xun Chang'an silently thought.As Murong Qi kowtowed, he noticed Xun Chang'an's arrival.He frowned and thought, \"This person is so ugly.\"Xun Chang'an's ugliness made Murong Qi feel a little nauseous. However, for some reason, he felt that it was this person who attracted him.The two feelings intertwined in Murong Qi's heart, creating strange sparks.Could this person be the Deity Slaying Elder?Wasn't the Deity Slaying Elder supposed to be good-looking?He will bring me great opportunities?Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experienceSuppressing the discomfort in his heart, Murong Qi gritted his teeth and said, \"Senior, please accept me as your disciple!\"In Journey to the West, all the demons want to eat Tang Seng, the monk master, for immortality.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His cultivation level was slightly higher than Murong Qi's, so it wasn't difficult for him to take in a disciple. However, he had to ask his master about this.\"Continue kowtowing.\" With that said, Xun Chang'an went up the mountain.Murong Qi knew that the other party was testing him.He continued to kowtow.After arriving at the Connate Cave Abode, Xun Chang'an told Han Jue about Murong Qi wanting to become his disciple.Han Jue opened his eyes. His expression was strange.Murong Qi wants to become Xun Chang'an's disciple?He thought that Murong Qi wanted to eat him.Han Jue asked, \"What do you think?\"Xun Chang'an said from the entrance, \"I have some affinity with this person. If Master doesn't object, I'll accept him.\"Han Jue thought for a moment. The other party was the reincarnation of Profound Truth Divine Emperor. It wasn't bad to get close to him.Han Jue replied, \"Go ahead, you can bring him to the Fusang Tree to cultivate. In the future, you will be in charge of him. He's not allowed to leave the surroundings of the Fusang Tree without permission.\"Xun Chang'an was overjoyed and hurriedly thanked him.He then immediately went down the mountain to open the formation and let Murong Qi in.Murong Qi stood up and walked in front of Xun Chang'an. He knelt down and kowtowed solemnly, then called him Master.Xun Chang'an was very happy. This was his first disciple.\"Let's go. Follow me up the mountain. Apart from me, there's also your grandmaster, your grandmaster's wife, and a black chicken at the Soul Formation Realm.\"Xun Chang'an introduced as he led the way.Murong Qi was secretly shocked. This mountain actually had a Soul Formation Realm beast!Is this the foundation of the Jade Pure Sect?Wait!Grandmaster?Could it be that this person isn't the Deity Slaying Elder?Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceMurong Qi suddenly noticed that Xun Chang'an was a monk. Could he be the monk that Elder Guan had mentioned who knelt for five years?Having thought this through, Murong Qi was not embarrassed or angry.He could sense that it was Xun Chang'an who attracted him!The two of them moved quickly. When they reached the Fusang Tree, Murong Qi saw the Black Hell Chicken.He was stunned by the Fusang Tree.What tree is this?The Black Hell Chicken opened one of its eyes and said indifferently, \"Chang'an, have you told him the rules? If he decides to join our mountain, he can't cause trouble everywhere like Yang Tiandong. You have to discipline him well in the future. If he dares to mess around, I won't be polite.\"Xun Chang'an cursed silently, Stupid chicken, who are you trying to intimidate?Thinking that Han Jue might be watching from the cave abode, he could only promise the chicken.Xun Chang'an made Murong Qi kneel down and kowtow to the Connate Cave Abode.\"Endure Today, Freedom Tomorrow?\"Murong Qi noticed a line of words at the entrance and pondered.He obediently knelt down and kowtowed three times.Just like that, Murong Qi joined the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain and Han Jue had another grand disciple.As he cultivated with Xun Chang'an, Murong Qi was pleasantly surprised to find that the Spirit Qi here was very dense. Especially when he sat next to him, not only was he not disturbed, but he even absorbed more Spirit Qi.It was indeed a fortuitous encounter!Murong Qi was pleased. It seemed that his intuition was correct!\u2026Another year passed.On this day, the sect master of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect, Liu Bumie, and Daoist Calm Sky arrived.Daoist Calm Sky was extremely nervous. Although he had left a soul fragment in the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect, he was still afraid of facing Han Jue.Han Jue sensed their aura and immediately checked the Jade Pure Sect.[Liu Bumie: Seventh level of the Void Amalgamation Realm, Sect Master of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect]That's it?Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceHan Jue couldn't understand. How could the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect dare to challenge the Formless Sect?But on second thought, he understood.Their sect's strength was definitely the best around the Great Yan. It was also geographically far from the Formless Sect. This world did not have phones or a network, so it was normal for the information to be inaccurate.Out of caution, Han Jue still used the simulation trial to fight with them.He fought both of them at the same time.Instant kill!Safe!The duo didn't fly to the main peak but arrived at the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.\"Greetings, Deity Slaying Elder. Sect Master of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect, Liu Bumie, and Elder Daoist Clear Sky are here to visit.\"Daoist Calm Sky bowed. He knew that the Jade Pure Sect would definitely agree as long as the Deity Slaying Elder agreed.Liu Bumie bowed as well. He was also a little nervous. Daoist Clear Sky said he was unable to defend against the Jade Pure Sect's Deity Slaying Elder. How could he dare to underestimate Han Jue?Under the Fusang Tree, Murong Qi's eyes widened as he said in astonishment, \"The sect master of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect is here?\"He had previously been an itinerant cultivator and had heard of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect. To him, they were much stronger than the Jade Pure Sect.Xun Chang'an said expressionlessly, \"Continue cultivating.\"Murong Qi nodded and closed his eyes, but his attention drifted down the mountain.Han Jue appeared out of thin air in front of the two of them. The Reincarnation Sword Intent erupted and locked onto them.In an instant, Liu Bumie and Daoist Calm Sky couldn't move. They felt as if they were facing death.Cold sweat began to seep out from the foreheads of the two, especially Daoist Calm Sky. He almost died of fright.

It seemed that he had made the right move by joining the Jade Pure Sect!On the other side, Han Jue returned to the cave abode. He thought for a moment, took out the Book of Misfortune, and started cursing Enlightened Old Monster.Although he wasn't afraid of the Formless Sect, they had many people. If they attacked the Jade Pure Sect, the losses would definitely be heavy.As long as Enlightened Old Monster remained injured, he could definitely hold back the Formless Sect.A month later.The Blood Fire Heavenly Sect officially announced that they would join the Jade Pure Sect.

Unfortunately, she rejected him.Xing Hongxuan was from the Jade Pure Sect.A few people were standing in front of him. Dong Wangxian was among them. He snorted and said, \"What kind of sect is the Jade Pure Sect? I've never heard of it. Besides, the Great Yan is publicly acknowledged as weak. Master, I'll personally go there and capture Liu Bumie!\"Enlightened Old Monster frowned and did not immediately agree.For some reason, he felt that the Jade Pure Sect was very strange.Ever since he had asked Xing Hongxuan about the marriage, he had often been cursed. Could it be that the person cursing him was from this sect?Some mighty figures had the power to affect karma, could it be that Xing Hongxuan's husband was the one who had been cursing him?It was very likely!Nothing else could explain such a coincidence!Enlightened Old Monster had never encountered such a thing in the past.

He felt that this was not enough. They had agreed to destroy the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect. How could it end just because they had joined the Jade Pure Sect?If this got out, wouldn't others think that the Formless Sect was afraid of the Jade Pure Sect?\"Master, be careful of letting a threat grow!\" Dong Wangxian said softly.The others looked at each other.They were all the higher-ups of the Formless Sect. In fact, they also wanted to give up.After all, they were a cultivation sect and not a mortal dynasty. The most important thing for cultivators was time. It was the right thing to spend time pursuing the Great Dao. It wasn't good to keep fighting!Moreover, the Formless Sect wasn't in the demonic path.

He looked more and more handsome.Immediately, he took out the Book of Misfortune and started cursing Enlightened Old Monster and the Vermilion Bird.Every time he took a break from cultivating, he would curse his enemies, it was like a habit now.In the past ten years, Murong Qi and Xun Chang'an's cultivation had also advanced by leaps and bounds.Murong Qi was indeed very talented.

How dare such a sect put on airs?Today, he would teach them the rules!Han Jue frowned. He was angry, too.This fellow was really pushing his luck!\"Are you still not coming out? Do you want me to force you out?\" Ji Lengchan shouted angrily.His cold attitude was the most infuriating.Just as he finished speaking, a sword Qi suddenly shot out from the immortal mountain like a bolt of lightning, extremely fast.So fast!Ji Lengshan's expression changed. He instinctively raised his sword to block.Boom!The sword Qi flew past the mountains, heading straight for him.Before Ji Lengchan could even cast a spell, the sword Qi engulfed him. His body was crushed into bits, leaving only his essence soul holding the sword. The domineering Reincarnation Sword Intent did not destroy his essence soul, only because a golden dragon was coiling around it.That's right!A golden dragon!The golden dragon looked both real and illusory. Cracks appeared on its body, and it almost could not block the Heaven Earth Mystic Yellow World Piercing Sword Finger.Just as Han Jue was about to point again, the golden dragon shouted, \"Wait! We can talk! I apologize on behalf of this stupid junior!\"Han Jue stopped and said, \"I've already admitted defeat, but he's going too far. He still wants to destroy my sect. I don't want to cause trouble, but I'm definitely not afraid of it!\"Ji Lengchan was still in a state of shock.Impossible!That move just now\u2026I couldn't even take a single blow from him\u2026Ji Lengchan's Dao Heart shattered.Seeing that Han Jue didn't continue to attack, the golden dragon heaved a sigh of relief and said, \"Fellow Daoist, this is indeed Lengchan's fault.

Go back to seclusion after this matter ends. You are not to come out for a hundred years!\"He was truly infuriated. He had been cultivating just a moment ago, but he had sensed that Ji Lengshan was in danger. Through the golden dragon, he had already understood everything.Such actions were simply an insult to the Heavenly Immortal Manor!Ji Lengchan seemed as if he'd been struck by lightning, and he said agitatedly, \"Master\u2026 I just came out!\"He wanted to vomit blood.

    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Top Tier Providence, Secretly Cultivate for a Thousand YearsCH 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFive years had passed since Ji Lengchan had come to challenge them.In the past five years, the Jade Pure Sect had been very smooth-sailing. They hadn't encountered any major tribulations. The entire sect had been in a state of cultivation.The cultivation level of the disciples of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect was generally higher than that of the Jade Pure Sect disciples. If they wanted to truly subdue the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect, they had to increase their cultivation level.In a quiet hall, a black-robed Mo Zhu was meditating.Ever since she was betrayed by Han Jue, she had been locked up here and couldn't leave.The sect didn't mistreat her. Whatever she wanted, they would satisfy her, including cultivation treasures.Unable to escape, Mo Zhu focused on cultivation. After so many years, her cultivation level had already reached the eighth level of the Golden Core Realm.Her cultivation speed could be considered fast. The reason why it was so fast was due to Daoist Nine Cauldrons' transformation of the sect. Not only her, but the average cultivation speed of the Jade Pure Sect disciples had increased by more than two times.Mo Zhu frowned. There was a hint of murderous intent between her eyebrows.\"Kill your way out! Leave this place and avenge the Mo Family!\"\"What are you waiting for?\"\"Your brother Mo Fuchou is still waiting for your help!\"The strange voice kept ringing in her ears. It was as if a spirit was bewitching her, causing her body to tremble slightly.After a long while\u2026Mo Zhu suddenly opened her eyes and spread her arms. A terrifying demonic aura erupted and shook the Spirit Qi in the hall. It was invisible and tangible, like a shock wave that shook the palace.Mo Zhu lowered her head and breathed heavily. Sweat poured down her face like rain.\"Why is this cultivation technique\u2026 Could the Mo Family really be fiendish?\" Mo Zhu thought with trepidation.What she cultivated was not the cultivation technique of the Jade Pure Sect, but the cultivation technique of the Mo Family's ancestors. Ever since she broke through to the Golden Core Realm, her spirit energy had begun to transform. It was different from the fiendish cultivators she usually saw. It was vast and sinister, but not cold.She didn't notice that the demonic Qi had condensed into a figure above her head. It had two pairs of wings and looked terrifying.Mo Zhu hesitated about continuing to cultivate this technique.If she re-cultivated, who knew how much time would be wasted.She couldn't help but think of Han Jue. His cultivation must be ridiculously high. She finally had hope of catching up to him and didn't want to give up.Mo Zhu gritted her teeth and continued cultivating.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.com\u2026The same month, the Jade Pure Sect welcomed an esteemed guest, the Formless Sect's Sect Master, Enlightened Old Monster.As the Sect Master, Li Qingzi had no choice but to step forward.Han Jue caught the aura of Enlightened Old Monster and immediately tested him. He started the simulation trial.At the seventh level of the Body Integration Realm, Enlightened Old Monster was naturally not Han Jue's match.In the first battle, Han Jue used more than ten breaths of time. This fellow's Mystical Power was very strange. His physical body could resurrect after dying, and only when his essence soul was destroyed would his body truly die.After eight trials, Han Jue finally found a way to instantly kill Enlightened Old Monster.He was satisfied.Two hours later.Li Qingzi brought Enlightened Old Monster to the Connate Cave Abode.Under the Fusang Tree, Murong Qi and Xun Chang'an couldn't help but look over. They were puzzled. This was the first time Li Qingzi had brought someone to look for Han Jue.\"Elder Han, the Formless Sect's sect master specially came to visit you. Would you be willing to meet him?\" Li Qingzi asked, feeling nervous.The Formless Sect was too powerful. Li Qingzi didn't dare to offend them easily and could only bring them to Han Jue.If Enlightened Old Monster had any ill intentions, he could sneak in.The entrance of the Connate Cave Abode suddenly opened and Han Jue's voice sounded, \"Come in.\"Upon hearing that, Enlightened Old Monster smiled. He immediately entered the cave abode and closed the entrance.Li Qingzi did not leave but waited outside the cave abode.He was a little nervous. Would Elder Han blame him?However, Enlightened Old Monster had clearly indicated that he wanted to find Han Jue. If he refused, the other party would be furious and he would still have to seek Han Jue's help in a fight.After entering the Connate Cave Abode, Enlightened Old Monstern saw Han Jue and was instantly stunned.What a handsome man!Even Dong Wangxian couldn't compare to Han Jue in terms of appearance and temperament.Sitting on the bed, Han Jue asked, \"Why are you visiting me?\"For more, visit lightnovelworld.comPerfect timing!There's a path to heaven, but you don't want to take it. There's no gate to hell, but you insist on barging in!Don't even think about leaving now!Enlightened Old Monster walked to the side of the table and sat down. He smiled and said, \"I've long heard of the Jade Pure Sect's Deity Slaying Elder's elegant demeanor. I've come to pay a visit. In addition, I want to resolve our grudge. Previously, I didn't know that Miss Xing was your Dao Companion. It was indeed my fault. Therefore, I didn't continue to target the Jade Pure Sect for subduing the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect.\"Han Jue pretended to be confused. \"Is that so? Thank you, fellow Daoist.\"Nice bullshit!From the initial 4-star level of hatred to the current 5-star level of hatred, you definitely want to tear me into pieces!Han Jue thought to himself. Enlightened Old Monster was very friendly, but he could see his hatred for him and naturally didn't believe him.\"In addition, I've been cursed all these years. Was it your doing? If so, I hope that you won't take your anger out on me. I won't disturb Miss Xing anymore. Our two sects can also build a friendly relationship,\" Enlightened Old Monster said seriously.Han Jue raised his eyebrows and asked in surprise, \"Curse? I'm not such a person. Besides, I've never seen you before. Why would I curse you?\"This fellow was amazing!He actually guessed that Han Jue was cursing him.No!He had to be eradicated!Enlightened Old Monster cursed in his mind, Shameless! Who else can it be but you?At the same time, he estimated Han Jue's strength.Although Han Jue was covered in Numinous Treasures, he didn't emit an aura that made his heart palpitate.Should I take this opportunity to kill him?He didn't dare to admit it, which meant that he was afraid of him.Once this person died, Xing Hongxuan would belong to his disciple. The Jade Pure Sect and the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect would also be annexed by the Formless Sect.As soon as this thought appeared, it quickly expanded to fill his mind.\"Fellow Daoist, let's stop pretending. I'm not here to blame you. I just want you to stop,\" Enlightened Old Monster smiled and said.[Enlightened Old Monster's hatred for you has increased. Current Hatred Points: 5.5 stars]Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experienceDamn it!It rose again?Han Jue's eyes turned cold.\u2026Outside the cave abode.Xun Chang'an frowned and said, \"Sect Master, my master doesn't like to be disturbed. Aren't you breaking his rules by doing this? At that time, the Formless Sect will know that the Deity Slaying Elder is my master.\"Li Qingzi was a little embarrassed and said helplessly, \"The Formless Sect's Sect Master wanted to come to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain directly. He only asked me to lead the way because he was afraid of ruining our harmony.\"The Black Hell Chicken on the Fusang Tree was extremely nervous.Its cultivation level was close to the Void Amalgamation Realm, but it still felt uneasy facing Enlightened Old Monster. What did this mean?This meant that Enlightened Old Monster was very powerful!Will Master be alright\u2026? Should I rush in and run away with Master?Boom\u2014A loud sound suddenly came from the Connate Cave Abode, startling Li Qingzi.The Black Hell Chicken transformed into a black bolt of lightning and charged into the cave abode.The moment he did so, he saw Enlightened Old Monster standing in front of Han Jue.\"Master! I'll\u2026\"\"Shut up!\"Han Jue snorted and interrupted the chicken.The Black Hell Chicken was stunned. It looked at Enlightened Old Monster with wide eyes.Enlightened Old Monster no longer made it uneasy.This fellow\u2026Was dead?Han Jue said expressionlessly, \"I've destroyed his essence soul. Tell the Sect Master that the Formless Sect's head is having a good chat with me and intends to stay for a few more days.\"Follow new episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.The Black Hell Chicken was stunned.The cave abode had not even collapsed, yet Master had already obliterated Enlightened Old Monster's essence soul.

The restrictions in the Connate Cave Abode had long been elevated by Han Jue. His divine sense could not enter.The Black Hell Chicken harrumphed. \"Didn't Master Chicken already say? Cultivate well. If you encounter a powerful enemy you can't defeat in the future, with your cultivation level, Master and I won't even bring you along!\"Murong Qi was stunned.Xun Chang'an shook his head. He had long been used to the fact that the Black Hell Chicken often talked about running away.Inside the Connate Cave Abode.Han Jue was checking Enlightened Old Monster's storage rings.This guy had four rings. As the sect master, he was naturally rich.When Han Jue counted, he almost drooled.With so many treasures and resources, it was enough to establish a sect.If he handed it over to the Jade Pure Sect, they would definitely be able to soar even faster.However, Han Jue was not so selfless.These are all mine!After searching for a while, Han Jue suddenly found a token.The words \"Heavenly Immortal\" were carved on it.Beside the Heavenly Immortal Token was a letter from the Heavenly Immortal Manor.The content was roughly such that by using this Heavenly Immortal Token, he could register to join the Heavenly Immortal Manor, but whether he could pass depended on his aptitude.The Heavenly Immortal Manor never looked at the cultivation level. They only looked at the potential.After injecting spirit energy into the token, it would lead the applicants to search for the location of the Heavenly Immortal Manor. Once the applicants found it, the token would disappear.In other words, this Heavenly Immortal Token had yet to be used.Other than the Heavenly Immortal Token, Enlightened Old Monster actually had Body Integration Realm cultivation pills. This made Han Jue somewhat surprised.New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.comThis guy is not bad!After counting, Han Jue began to split his soul. He used the method of creating the Heavenly Puppet. He only needed to split a portion of his soul to control Enlightened Old Monster's body.Being cautious, Han Jue still decided to divert the trouble.What if the Formless Sect had a backer?\u2026Seven days later.Enlightened Old Monster left the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. Sect Master Li Qingzi led dozens of elders and deacons to send him off. This matter caused a huge discussion in the sect.In the cultivation world they were in, the Formless Sect was definitely the most dazzling existence. Previously, they had crushed the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect with absolute dominance, causing their name to shake the world. In their eyes, there was still a considerable gap between them and the Formless Sect.Li Qingzi publicly announced that the Formless Sect would befriend the Jade Pure Sect and build a good relationship.This news quickly spread to the Great Yan and caused many sects to discuss it.After leaving the Jade Pure Sect, Han Jue controlled Enlightened Old Monster to fly in a random direction. He moved forward very quickly.The soul fragment that Han Jue left in Enlightened Old Monster could only last for a month before disappearing.He had to shift Enlightened Old Monster's death away before that happened.Thinking about it, Han Jue didn't have any enemies now. The Vermilion Bird was in the Upper Realm, and the Demon Taming Sect was in the distant North State. He didn't know who to frame for Enlightened Old Monster's death.If there was no other way, he would push it onto the demons!In less than two days, Enlightened Old Monster left the Great Yan region.Han Jue continued forward aimlessly.Along the way, he encountered many sects, but they were all too weak. They couldn't withstand the Formless Sect's revenge at all.He had to go to a powerful sect!There might not be one in the Great Yan, but there should be one in other cultivation worlds.Han Jue had never left the Jade Pure Sect in his life, so he didn't know much about the other cultivation worlds. He could only stay as far away from the Great Yan as possible.Dong Wangxian was troubled.Before entering the Jade Pure Sect, Enlightened Old Monster was afraid that Dong Wangxian would cause trouble, so he was made to stay outside the sect.Dong Wangxian followed after Enlightened Old Monster.Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better experienceEnlightened Old Monster had died too quickly. Before he died, he had yet to use his Body Integration Realm spirit energy. Han Jue controlled him to fly at full speed, so how could Dong Wangxian catch up?\"Master went mad?\" Dong Wangxian frowned as flew on his sword.As the distance between the master and disciple increased, not only did he have to chase, he also had to determine his direction.Two figures appeared ahead.It was Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou.The three of them brushed past each other.For some reason, Zhou Fan and Dong Wangxian turned their heads.Their eyes met. When the two of them saw each other, their hearts inexplicably palpitated as if they had encountered their natural enemy.\"Who is this person?\" Zhou Fan frowned.Dong Wangxian muttered to himself, \"Who is this kid? I hate him for some reason.\"The two of them didn't stay any longer and vanished into different directions.Zhou Fan looked at Mo Fuchou and said, \"That person just now made me feel uncomfortable. If he wasn't very strong, I would have dealt with him.\"Mo Fuchou was speechless. He said unhappily, \"Can you stop? How much have I suffered after following you? We're returning to the Jade Pure Sect this time. Don't cause trouble anymore.\"Zhou Fan chuckled. \"I know. I really want to see their expressions when they see us, especially Han Jue.\"Mo Fuchou shook his head.Somehow, he had a hunch.It was not Han Jue who would be shocked, but them.However, the current Zhou Fan was very arrogant. Not long ago, he had severely injured a Soul Formation cultivator, so his ego inflated.Zhou Fan believed that even if Han Jue was the Deity Slaying Elder, his cultivation level shouldn't have increased much over the years.The Spirit Qi of the Great Yan was too weak. It was completely incomparable to the other cultivation worlds. The Soul Formation Stage mighty figures of the other cultivation worlds might not even be able to break through a minor realm in a hundred years, let alone Han Jue of the Great Yan.\u2026Half a month later.Han Jue controlled Enlightened Old Monster to a deep mountain. There were no traces of humans within a thousand miles.Enlightened Old Monster continued forward. He didn't hold back his aura of the Body Integration Realm at all, scaring all the beasts away.This content is taken from lightnovelworld.comHan Jue felt that it was about time.He found a random place and left Enlightened Old Monster behind. A great cultivator from the Formless Sect would definitely be able to track him here.Han Jue made him land under a tree and carve a word on the tree trunk.\u2014Demons!If someone from the Formless Sect saw it, their imagination would definitely run wild.After doing all of this, Han Jue directly severed his soul fragment, which quickly dissipated. Enlightened Old Monster sat under the tree. His head suddenly hung down and his hands landed on the ground without any life.When his consciousness returned to the Connate Cave Abode, Han Jue heaved a sigh of relief.That should be fine!He then took out the Book of Misfortune and cursed the Vermilion Bird first.Seven days later.Bored, Han Jue opened his interpersonal relationships to check his emails.[Your disciple Su Qi spread bad luck.

He didn't see her. Instead, he saw a huge black egg formed by demonic Qi floating in the air. It was horrifying.Terrifying killing intent filled the hall, causing the temperature to drop to the freezing point.Han Jue directly moved into the hall.He walked in front of the black egg and probed it with his divine sense. He could sense Mo Zhu's aura.This demonic Qi had a very strong resistance. Even a Void Amalgamation Realm cultivator might not be able to penetrate it.Han Jue exerted some force, and his divine sense broke through the demonic aura and entered the black egg.He immediately felt awkward. Mo Zhu was naked in the egg. Her snow-white skin was too eye-catching.Han Jue waved his right hand. Six Paths spirit energy radiated out and sealed the palace.He rubbed his chin and thought, \"What happened?\"He could sense no other soul in Mo Zhu's body. In other words, she wasn't possessed.However, her soul was transforming, becoming inhuman.\"What's the background of the Mo Family? Mo Fuchou also fell into the demonic path\u2026\" Han Jue continued touching his chin in thought.Mo Fuchou was not simple. His cultivation was not too far behind Zhou Fan's. Not long after Zhou Fan broke through to the Nascent Soul realm, this fellow also reached it.Han Jue didn't dare to interrupt Mo Zhu, afraid that she would suffer a backlash.The commotion in the palace caused Daoist Jingxu to come over. She wanted to enter but was blocked by Han Jue's Six Paths spirit energy.\"It's fine. I'm here.\" Han Jue's voice was heard. Daoist Jingxu felt relieved.Because he had given instructions, Li Qingzi was also very careful with Mo Zhu. Usually, no one was allowed to approach the palace, and Daoist Jingxu was in charge of it.After Daoist Jingxu left, Han Jue continued to wait.Several days later, the demonic Qi black egg finally began to dissipate. When Mo Zhu's body landed on the ground, Han Jue immediately took out a robe and put it on her.Han Jue's expression turned strange. Mo Zhu's cultivation had actually reached the Nascent Soul Realm.Most importantly, she did not transcend the tribulation!This was ridiculous!Mo Zhu slowly opened her eyes. Han Jue's face squeezed into her vision. She wasn't frightened. Instead, she looked at Han Jue blurrily. She gently raised her right hand and touched his face.New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.comCompared to the past, the current Mo Zhu was much more beautiful. Her charming face was even more enchanting, enough to move most men.Han Jue frowned and said, \"Miss Mo, wake up!\"Mo Zhu didn't seem to hear him and continued to touch him.Pa!Han Jue slapped her, and she immediately sobered up.Mo Zhu covered her face and said aggrievedly, \"Why did you hit me again!\"Again?When did I hit you before?Han Jue didn't think too much about it and asked, \"What happened to your Mo Family? Why did you become a devil?\"Mo Zhu came back to her senses and subconsciously looked at her body. When she saw that her clothes had been changed into Han Jue's white robe, she was not afraid but pleasantly surprised.\"You changed my clothes?\"\"Of course.\"\"You saw my body?\"\"I didn't. I put on your clothes with my eyes closed.\"\"Why did you close your eyes? Isn't it because you saw it?\"\"Then I apologize.\"\"I don't want it. Anyway, you have to be responsible for me. From now on, I'll rely on you.\"\"Is this an elaborate scam?\"\"Scam?\"Han Jue had a headache. It was a sin to be too good-looking.He believed that other than being handsome and saving Mo Zhu's life, he had never cared about her.If it was Zhou Fan, Mo Zhu would have changed her mind already.Mo Zhu was pleased. Then, she began to answer the question, \"I'm not sure, either. Ever since I stepped into the Golden Core Realm, I often heard a voice when in cultivation. At first, I thought it was a mental demon. Not long ago, I discovered that it was not a mental demon but the will passed down by the ancestors of my family. The Mo Family is not a fiendish cultivator clan in the cultivation world, but the descendants of true devils. The devils were once a race. After they perished, their cultivation techniques were passed down to the human race and thus came the birth of fiendish cultivators. The Mo Family can be considered a descendant of the devil and human races.\"For more, visit lightnovelworld.comHan Jue narrowed his eyes and asked, \"Will you lose control?\"If Mo Zhu went mad and wanted to slaughter the world, how many slaps would he have to give to save her?Mo Zhu rolled her eyes and said, \"I'm not a fiendish cultivator, how can I lose control? Fiendish cultivators lose control easily because their bodies can't withstand the power of the fiendish technique. Their inner demons are the backlash of the devil's consciousness.\"Han Jue said seriously, \"Then don't do evil and harm the innocent. The Jade Pure Sect is a righteous sect, after all. That's unless someone wants to harm you.\"\"Of course.\"The two fell silent and the atmosphere became awkward.[Mo Youling has developed hatred towards you.

Current Hatred Points: 3 stars]A question mark popped up in Han Jue's head.Mo Zhu suddenly took a step forward and mustered her courage. She stuttered shily, \"Han Jue, I have inherited the techniques of the Mo Family's ancestors. Among them, there's a dual\u2026 a two-person cultivation technique. Are you willing to cultivate with me? It's good for both of us\u2026\"Han Jue frowned.\u2026A month later.Han Jue was done comforting Mo Zhu and returned to the Connate Cave Abode.The first thing he did upon returning was to take out the Book of Misfortune and curse Mo Youling.This woman wants to kill me?Could he ignore that?Han Jue was afraid that she would one day break out of the restriction by herself and come to disturb his cultivation. At that time, perhaps because of Mo Zhu, he would be in a dilemma. It would be better for Mo Youling to not come out.Thus, every few years, he would curse Mo Youling.After cursing for seven days, Han Jue took out the pills he got from Enlightened Old Monster and started to cultivate.This content is taken from lightnovelworld.comTime passed quickly.Mo Zhu faced Han Jue like a subservient wife. He told her to cultivate in the palace and not go out, and she happily agreed. After all, they had been together for a month and their relationship had improved a lot.Han Jue sent a voice transmission to Li Qingzi asking him to provide some pills to her.Upon hearing that Mo Zhu was already at the Nascent Soul realm, Li Qingzi was overjoyed. He immediately arranged for Mo Zhu to be a core disciple and had Daoist Jingxu send her pills and treasures every once in a while.The Jade Pure Sect was now a quiet tiger in the long river of history. It was quietly becoming stronger, not flamboyant or arrogant.Eight years passed quickly.Relying on pills, Han Jue finally reached the fifth level of the Body Integration Realm. He had also used up all of Enlightened Old Monster's pills.Cultivation at the Body Integration Realm was very difficult. Han Jue's cultivation speed was already pretty fast.A 400-year-old expert at the fifth level of the Body Integration Realm. Who would believe that?On this day, Xing Hongxuan returned.The first thing this girl did was to find Han Jue.He let her in, curious about what she was going to give him this time.Xing Hongxuan sat down next to him and took out a stalk of purple grass from her storage ring. The leaf flickered with a faint light.\"Husband, I found this in the land of the demons. During this period of time, I left the Great Yan and went to the West Abyss. This grass is not simple. When I discovered it, I saw two Demon Kings fighting over it. I took advantage of the fact that they were both injured to snatch it away,\" Xing Hongxuan said proudly.Han Jue asked in surprise, \"Are you so powerful now?\"Xing Hongxuan was only at the fourth-stage Golden Core Realm. How could she snatch such a treasure from the hands of two Demon Kings?Xing Hongxuan covered her mouth and laughed. \"Didn't I comprehend a Mystical Power in a mystic realm? The divine technique recorded a movement method. I've already mastered it. If I can't defeat them, I can still escape. No person or demon can catch up to me.\"Why did Han Jue feel that this girl's luck had also improved?Could it be that she was influenced by his providence as an Immortal Emperor's descendant?Han Jue took the purple grass, and a line of words suddenly appeared in front of him.[Detected that the natural treasure has the potential of becoming a Connate providence bearer.

Then, an Immortal descended to the mortal world and meditated around it. After a hundred years of bathing in Immortal Qi, it gradually shed its mortal form. During the ten thousand years, it often encountered the calamity of destruction. Every time before it perished, it would instinctively turn into dust and scatter into the world, before growing again. This grass has the potential to become a divine grass, or even an Immortal God.]Immortal God cultivation potential?It was a little scary!Han Jue raised his eyebrows.This life force was really strong. It had held on for ten thousand years.Han Jue took the Heaven and Earth Grass and smiled at Xing Hongxuan. \"I'll take this grass. How have you been all these years?\"Xing Hongxuan was even more delighted. She began to describe her experiences over the years.Over the past few years, Xing Hongxuan had become the protagonist of fantasy novels. She traveled the world with her sword and helped others when she saw injustice. She fought against fiendish cultivators, barged into ancient tombs, hunted down enemies, and slaughtered her way into the demon realm.After hearing her, Han Jue had the urge to go out and take a look.Wait!Han Jue was alerted.This woman was definitely arranged by the Heavenly Dao to entice him to leave.The first 400 years had been a success. Looking back, how many powerful enemies had been reduced to bones because they didn't know his strength? Speaking of which, he had few enemies.Look at Zhou Fan, Yang Tiandong, Chaotic Heavenly Dog, Su Qi\u2026Every time he checked his emails, he saw them getting beaten up.It was the same for Li Qingzi previously. As long as he went out, he would definitely suffer. Now, he stayed in the Jade Pure Sect every day and no longer got injured.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.com\"Only after leaving the Great Yan will we know how small it is. Take the West Abyss State, for example. The Jade Pure Sect is not even considered a second-rate sect there. We're only able to have our current reputation because of you, my husband. I think that you should be at the top of the list of the top hundred cultivators in the world, which has recently caused chaos in the cultivation world!\"The more Xing Hongxuan spoke, the more excited she became. Han Jue inexplicably thought of those people who went back to their hometown after adventuring in the major city in his previous life.And what was this list of the top hundred cultivators?Too shallow!Han Jue didn't care about fame, only profit.After Xing Hongxuan finished speaking, he took out some longevity-enhancing pills from his storage ring and said, \"These are for you. Your potential is mediocre. I'm afraid that you'll die too early.\"Xing Hongxuan rolled her eyes. \"You only know how to tease me.\"\"I'm serious.\"\"Don't worry, I've already taken such pills, and also natural treasures. I have a long lifespan.\"That's good!\"Speaking of lifespan, the eldest disciple of Jade Serene Peak, Liu Sanxin, died decades ago. The sect has too few lifespan-enhancing methods. If he had left the Great Yan as soon as possible, there might still be a chance.\"Xing Hongxuan sighed, while Han Jue was stunned.He felt that some people were missing from his friend list, but he couldn't recall them.Speaking of Liu Sanxin, Han Jue still remembered that this senior brother wanted to take care of him.Before I could trouble him, he was already gone.Han Jue said seriously, \"Cultivate well. Don't become the next Senior Liu.\"\"I can't bear to leave this world. I still want to accompany you, my husband.\"Then, Han Jue asked her to take out the Heavenly Puppet. He wanted to upgrade its spirit energy.After a few days, he filled Xing Hongxuan's Heavenly Puppet with Six Paths spirit energy and she put it away in her storage ring.The most up-to-date novels are published on lightnovelworld.comWith the Heavenly Puppet around, Han Jue could also rest assured that she could go out and explore.Han Jue thought that it would end like this, but Xing Hongxuan pestered him for another month.Sigh.After she left, Han Jue took out the Heaven and Earth Grass and planted it in the cave abode.This grass was too small. If it was planted under the Fusang Tree, it might be trampled to death one day.After planting it, Han Jue smiled in satisfaction.He had been in a good mood recently, so he might as well curse the Vermilion Bird and Mo Youling to liven things up.\u2026In one of the catacombs, the spikes hanging from the ceiling were sinister and terrifying, dripping with water.One of the inverted thorns was tied with a blood tendon. At the bottom were two people. They were Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou. Both of them had disheveled hair and ragged clothes and they were covered in blood. Below them was a huge pot boiling with murky oil.Looking from above, the catacombs were filled with demons. There were countless of them, and most of them were napping.Zhou Fan gritted his teeth and looked in one direction. A giant demon had taken form. Even sitting, it was 50 feet tall. It had a strong body and wore heavy armor made of snake scales. It had an ugly and sinister snake head.A figure stood beside the snake demon. It was Han Jue's eldest disciple, Yang Tiandong.\"Hmph! Demons' lackey!\" Zhou Fan cursed. He was extremely unhappy.Mo Fuchou sighed. \"It's not his fault. If you want to blame something, blame it on our own bad luck. We accidentally entered Great Sage Green Python's territory and you were rash enough to kill the patrolling demons.\"Zhou Fan was even angrier when he heard that. He cursed, \"That fellow is too arrogant. He keeps calling us mortals and even wants us to kneel down and beg for mercy. Can you tolerate that?\"Mo Fuchou smiled bitterly. It was too late to say anything now.On the other side, Great Sage Green Python laughed. \"Dong'er, tell me, how should we deal with these two? Should we cook them or refine them into pills?\"Yang Tiandong frowned and said helplessly, \"Foster father, do we have to kill them?\"Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experience\"They killed my demons, so they must die. Dong'er, if you want to inherit my power, you have to sever ties with the human race. Humans and demons are irreconcilable. This is the rule of the world. You cannot waver.\"Yang Tiandong cursed silently after hearing that. Do you think I want to be a demon?When he heard Zhou Fan scold him, his heart ached even more.Back then, he and Zhou Fan were caught by the Raincoat Sect. They resisted together and were beaten together. They were very close. Now, in order to live, if he watched as Zhou Fan got cooked to death, how could he face the Jade Pure Sect and Han Jue?When I become a Demon Saint, I'll definitely kill all of you Demon Kings!Yang Tiandong was furious.The reason why he left the Great Yan was that Demon King Dian Su was in charge of the demon race there. He couldn't control them, so he went to other demons.As he fought, he finally managed to control a demon army. In the end, he encountered Great Sage Green Python.Great Sage Green Python wielded a million demon soldiers and had a high reputation among them. Yang Tiandong couldn't even withstand a single blow from him.Great Sage Green Python felt that his bloodline potential was not bad, so he took him in as his foster son. In order to survive, he could only live and wait for an opportunity to escape or counterattack. Then, he saw Zhou Fan and the other person getting caught.This affinity made Yang Tiandong very uncomfortable.\"Should I ask Master for help?\" This thought popped up in Yang Tiandong's head, but he quickly rejected it. \"I can't trouble him!\"At this moment\u2026A hawk demon flew over and shouted, \"Your Majesty, a cultivator who calls himself Dong Wangxian of the Formless Sect is shouting outside. He wants to slaughter all of us and avenge his master! He's too strong! We can't stop him!\"When Great Sage Green Python heard this, his expression darkened. He snorted coldly and said, \"Formless Sect? Just nice, this king has a grudge against Enlightened Old Monster!\"He rose to his feet. Terrifying demonic energy erupted, shaking the entire catacombs.\"Dong'er, stay here and watch over them. When I return, I hope to see them in the pot!\"Great Sage Green Python transformed into a green aura and vanished.Yang Tiandong looked at Zhou Fan and Mo Fuchou again, feeling extremely conflicted.Visit lightnovelworld.com for the best novel reading experienceShould he take this opportunity to save them?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the Formless Sect's Dong Wangxian.Dong Wangxian wielded his sword with both hands as he flew through the air. A red umbrella opened up and spun at high speed around him. It sliced through the attacking demons and blood rained down.Looking down, the entire mountain was filled with demon corpses. They were all incomplete and horrifying.\"Is that all you have? Where's your king?\"Dong Wangxian laughed impudently. High-spirited, his anger faded from the excitement of killing.This was what he wanted the most!Acting recklessly!Being unstoppable!Boom\u2014At the end of the horizon, a terrifying demonic aura suddenly rose. It broke through the clouds and shook the mountains, causing the trees on the mountains to shake violently as if they were about to be blown away.Dong Wangxian suddenly turned around with a solemn expression.This demonic aura\u2026This was the first time he had encountered such a terrifying demonic aura. It made his blood run cold.But who was he?How could the number one prodigy of the Formless Sect be afraid?Dong Wangxian roared, \"Was my master killed by you demons?\"Great Sage Green Python's laughter followed. \"Enlightened Old Monster is dead? Hahaha! What a joyous occasion! You're his disciple? Then you can forget about living!

The Heaven and Earth Grass had developed a habit of circulating the Spirit Qi of the world over the long years. In fact, Han Jue didn't need to pay special attention to it, as long as he didn't step on it.Two years passed quickly.The Heaven and Earth Grass had grown much taller, and the Spirit Qi here was much denser than in the Demon Region.Han Jue looked forward to it gaining intelligence and becoming a grass spirit, that would be quite interesting.Heavenly Dog, Chicken, Gourd, Fusang Tree, Ancient Spiritual Ginseng, Grass Spirit\u2026Tsk tsk.Han Jue even felt that he could open a botanical garden.On this day, Li Qingzi came to visit.Han Jue waited for him to enter the cave abode and immediately asked, \"The Formless Sect is here?\"Li Qingzi shook his head and said, \"No, but\u2026 the Grand Elder is about to die of old age.\"Han Jue frowned.There was only one Grand Elder in the Jade Pure Sect. He was Li Qingzi's master and had interacted with Han Jue before.Thinking about it carefully, it was normal. Han Jue was already more than 400 years old. In all these years, the cultivation level of the Grand Elder almost didn't increase. Naturally, his lifespan also didn't increase.\"Do you want me to meet him?\" Han Jue asked.After all, they were old friends. Han Jue didn't want to feel regretful like in Elder Iron's case.Li Qingzi shook his head and said, \"Master has already left the sect. He said that if he didn't return after twenty years, that means he died. He asked me to thank you and said that without Elder Han, the Jade Pure Sect would not be where it is today.\"Han Jue remained silent.He might have meant that, but there was more to it.Han Jue wasn't unhappy. He could understand the elder's concern.The source of this content is lightnovelworld.comAt the moment, he was quite comfortable in the Jade Pure Sect. No one disturbed him. Li Qingzi and the others would do their best to satisfy whatever he needed.\"Elder Han, although my cultivation level is also increasing, I feel that it will be very difficult to reach the Soul Formation realm. If I face my end one day, who do you think is suitable to be the next Sect Master?\" Li Qingzi asked.His expression did not darken. He had lived for so long and had sent away many old friends. He was already used to parting with them.The path of longevity was already filled with difficulties. If every mortal cultivated diligently and could live forever, longevity wouldn't be so crazy.Han Jue shook his head and said, \"I'm in seclusion all year round. How would I know?\"Li Qingzi smiled and asked, \"In the entire Jade Pure Sect, the most talented disciples are all under your tutelage. Just now, I discovered that Xun Chang'an and Murong Qi's cultivation levels are both going to reach the Nascent Soul realm. Such speed is unparalleled in the entire sect except for you.\"Han Jue frowned.Li Qingzi wanted to tie him and the Jade Pure Sect together completely!If Han Jue's disciple or grand disciple became the sect master, it was even more impossible for him to leave.\"Sect Master, I actually understand what you mean. These two are indeed talented, but there's one thing that needs to be said clearly. If I want to leave the sect in the future, the two of them will not be able to stop me. If I don't want to leave the sect and the sect faces an enemy that even I can't resist, I will also leave in order to save my life.\"I have had only one goal in life ever since I was born, and that is to live forever. I can help the Jade Pure Sect in pursuing this goal, but I will never abandon it for the sake of the sect.\"Han Jue spoke seriously. Li Qingzi wasn't surprised.The reason he chose Murong Qi and Xun Chang'an was mainly because of their natural talent.Although the Jade Pure Sect was growing stronger, very few disciples were more talented than the two of them. Only a powerful Sect Master could lead the sect to become stronger. Li Qingzi already felt helpless. His potential limited him.The two continued to talk.Taking this opportunity, Han Jue secretly gave him the Six Paths Insignia.Li Qingzi treated him well and Han Jue also had a good impression of him. If he could meet Li Qingzi in his next life, he was still willing to help.In the end, Han Jue agreed to let him take Murong Qi away and groom him into the next Sect Master.Before leaving, Han Jue suddenly asked, \"Sect Master, how's Fairy Xi Xuan's lifespan?\"Li Qingzi smiled and said, \"Junior Sister's potential is higher than mine. She even obtained a fortuitous encounter previously. It shouldn't be a problem for her to live for another few hundred years. She just returned. If you have nothing to do, you can visit her.\"He didn't think too much about it. After all, Han Jue and Fairy Xi Xuan were still master and disciple.Updated from lightnovelworld.comHan Jue nodded slightly.After Li Qingzi left, he continued cultivating.Murong Qi was taken away by Li Qingzi. Although Xun Chang'an was puzzled, he wouldn't say anything since Han Jue had agreed.Murong Qi didn't resist. After cultivating for so many years, he was also a little bored. It wasn't a bad idea to go out for a walk.\u2026Five years passed.The Heaven and Earth Grass had finally developed intelligence. It couldn't think, but it had already grown by leaps and bounds.With intelligence, it couldn't be treated like grass anymore.Han Jue gave it a name.Chou Cao!This fellow had the potential to become an immortal. To celebrate, Han Jue took out the Book of Misfortune and cursed the Vermilion Bird and Mo Youling.While cursing, he checked his emails.[Your disciple Yang Tiandong was attacked by a Demon King and was severely injured.

Han Jue wasn't his father and didn't have to follow him every day.Besides, Yang Tiandong had the Demon Saint bloodline. He wouldn't die so easily.Han Jue continued to try and break through to the sixth level of the Body Integration Realm.As more and more people from the Jade Pure Sect experienced life and death, Han Jue became more determined to cultivate.Not only did he have to cultivate diligently, but he also had to urge Xing Hongxuan and Mo Zhu to cultivate together and not slack off.\u2026In the blink of an eye, another seven years passed.Han Jue finally broke through to the sixth level of the Body Integration Realm.The Spirit Qi of the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain was the most concentrated in the Great Yan. The Fusang Tree and the Earth Immortal Gourd Vine were both creating Spirit Qi.Han Jue suddenly thought of the Grand Elder and used his divine sense to probe the Jade Serene Peak.Fairy Xi Xuan was still cultivating in the Jade Serene Hall.After so many years, she was already at the ninth level of the Nascent Soul realm. It was all thanks to the opportunities she had encountered outside that she could make such a breakthrough.\"Fairy Xi Xuan, why don't you move to the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain? I'll open up a cave abode for you.\"Han Jue sent a voice transmission to her.Fairy Xi Xuan opened her eyes. Her temperament had become more and more otherworldly and holy. Her devastatingly beautiful appearance was not the least bit overbearing. It was the kind of beauty that people simply liked, like a fairy from heaven.Fairy Xi Xuan frowned. \"That's your mountain. It's not convenient for me to go there.\"\"You should already know about the Grand Elder's issue. I've been cultivating my entire life. There aren't many people I care about. You're one of them. I hope to be able to walk the Great Dao with you. I don't want to be the only one left on the path of cultivation.\"If anyone else heard Han Jue's words, they would definitely feel that he was asking for a beating. However, Fairy Xi Xuan understood him. Ever since he entered the Jade Serene Peak, he had been cultivating diligently and had not even left the sect.Thinking of the Grand Elder, Fairy Xi Xuan's heart felt heavy.Although she had already sent away many of her fellow disciples, her master's death still made her feel a little uncomfortable.For more, visit lightnovelworld.com\"Come here, I won't disturb you without reason,\" Han Jue continued.Fairy Xi Xuan hesitated for a moment before finally agreeing.Han Jue asked her to pack up and come over directly. He then stood up and left his cave abode to open up a cave abode for her.On a hill not far away, Xun Chang'an and the Black Hell Chicken were curious.\"Master, are you opening a cave abode for me?\" Xun Chang'an asked in embarrassment.He was already used to staying under the Fusang Tree.Han Jue rolled his eyes at him and said, \"This is Fairy Xi Xuan's cave abode. Fairy Xi Xuan used to be my master and is now my friend. You are not to disturb her cultivation, understand?\"Xun Chang'an suddenly understood. He had naturally heard of Fairy Xi Xuan.The Black Hell Chicken asked, \"Does Fairy Xi Xuan want to eat you?\"\"Are you asking for a beating?\" Han Jue retorted angrily.The Black Hell Chicken might not have understood in the past, but now, it definitely did. How dare it tease him!The Black Hell Chicken trembled in fear, not daring to say anything.Soon, the cave abode was successfully created. Fairy Xi Xuan also successfully checked in.Seeing her appearance, Xun Chang'an was in a daze.He strengthened his Dao heart.His master was right. As long as his cultivation level was high, some beauties would like him.Qian'er was actually just like that. He didn't have to die for her.For some reason, ever since he had mastered the Heartless Flying Sword, Xun Chang'an was very calm every time he thought of Qian'er. He was no longer as restless as before.Han Jue was relieved after Fairy Xi Xuan moved over.As for Mo Zhu, forget it. He would think about it in the future.She had outstanding potential and did not need it for the time being. Furthermore, she wasn't on good terms with Xing Hongxuan.For more, visit lightnovelworld.comRecently, Xing Hongxuan had gone out again.With the Heavenly Puppet on her, Han Jue wasn't afraid that something would happen to her.Han Jue sat on the bed and checked his emails while using the Book of Misfortune to do his daily mission.The Chaotic Heavenly Dog, Zhou Fan, Mo Fuchou, and Yang Tiandong began competing on who would get the highest number of beatings.Some also obtained opportunities.What was worth mentioning was that the situation in the Demon Taming Sect was getting worse. Han Jue felt that it was about to collapse.The jinx has awakened his divinity, how terrifying is that?The fact that the Demon Taming Sect could last so long meant that they were worthy of their reputation!\u2026In a vast valley, a huge silver-furred demon hound crawled halfway up the mountain. There were many demons in the valley, including the surrounding mountain peaks.The silver-furred hound was none other than the Chaotic Heavenly Dog.After so many years, the Chaotic Heavenly Dog was no longer as fat as it was when it was young. Instead, it was very healthy. Under the sunlight, its demonic body looked extremely handsome.At that moment, it was lazily looking down at the people below.Yang Tiandong!Yang Tiandong looked at the lofty Chaotic Heavenly Dog with a complicated expression. He took a deep breath and said, \"Heavenly Dog, what do you think? Let's join forces to kill Great Sage Green Python and split the territory equally.\"Back then, Yang Tiandong had watched the Chaotic Heavenly Dog grow up. Now, its strength far exceeded his. It made him feel the difference in bloodlines.\"Call me the Great Sage of Chaos.\" The Chaotic Heavenly Dog yawned and said nonchalantly.Yang Tiandong was instantly annoyed. \"Do you believe that I'll go back and tell Master!\"The Chaotic Heavenly Dog immediately jolted when it heard that. It bristled as it glared at him. \"You still have the cheek to look for him? You haven't even gone back at all, how dare you talk about me?\"Yang Tiandong felt awkward. He was indeed embarrassed to go back and look for Han Jue.Ever since he had become a Demon King, the seeds of power and ambition had taken root in his heart. He could no longer cultivate as hard as before.New novel chapters are published on lightnovelworld.com\"We're from the same lineage, after all. We should help each other. I heard that you're often hunted by other Demon Kings, it's quite hard to watch. It'll be a win-win situation if we work together!\" Yang Tiandong said seriously.The Chaotic Heavenly Dog hesitated. \"Great Sage Green Python is too powerful. Few demons in the Ten States and Nine Dynasties can defeat him.\"Yang Tiandong said, \"I can return to the Great Yan to invite Demon King Dian Su. He's a ten-thousand-year-old demon and his strength is also unfathomable.\"The Chaotic Heavenly Dog fell silent.\"Great Sage Green Python is expanding madly. He will come to you sooner or later. The Formless Sect knows this, right? All these years, the Formless Sect has been frantically trying to encircle him, but all of them have failed. However, because of this, they have been exhausting Great Sage Green Python. This is our chance. If we wait any longer, you and I can only be his dogs!\"\"Eh? Looking down on dogs?\"\"Ok, fine. We'll end up as his slaves!\"\"No, we alone are not enough. You have to continue persuading the other Demon Kings.\"\"Alright!\"\u2026Han Jue didn't know what the Chaotic Heavenly Dog and Yang Tiandong were doing outside. Ever since Fairy Xi Xuan moved over, his life had become a little more interesting.Every two years, Han Jue would look for Fairy Xi Xuan to discuss the Dao. Fairy Xi Xuan also welcomed him. After all, both parties would benefit.Han Jue's Dao technique was more profound than Fairy Xi Xuan's, but he was inferior to her in terms of knowledge.Just like that, eight years passed.Murong Qi had already become the Eldest Disciple of the Jade Pure Sect. With his invincible strength at the Golden Core Realm, no one dared to question him.On this day, in the mountains outside the Jade Pure Sect, Zhou Fan, Mo Fuchou, and the purple-dressed woman with the surname Xuan slowly walked forward.\"I'm finally back!\" Zhou Fan shouted in excitement.Mo Fuchou sighed. \"The Jade Pure Sect has changed so much.\"The Spirit Qi in the nearby mountains and rivers was denser than before. Disciples flying in and out of the sky on their swords could also be seen. It looked like they were much stronger than before.The purple-dressed woman was very curious about the Jade Pure Sect.

He had a good impression of Han Jue and always felt that he was very talented. Although Zhou Fan was powerful, he relied more on opportunities.Zhou Fan snorted. \"Isn't the reason why the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect sought refuge with the Jade Pure Sect because of the Formless Sect's coercion? The reason why the Formless Sect didn't target the Jade Pure Sect after that was because Enlightened Old Monster suffered a tragic death and they didn't have the time to find trouble with them. The Jade Pure Sect might not be stronger than the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect.\"Mo Fuchou felt that it made sense.The disciples in the sky were not as strong as the disciples of the large sects.The purple-dressed woman's gaze landed on the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain. She frowned.\"The Spirit Qi in that mountain is so abundant. How can it be\u2026\"The purple-dressed woman was shocked. Such Spirit Qi was already comparable to some hidden Holy Lands and ten-thousand-year-old cultivation families.At the same time, Han Jue was teaching the Black Hell Chicken under the Fusang Tree.The Black Hell Chicken had already transcended its tribulation and reached the Void Amalgamation Realm in the past eight years. It had also transcended the tribulation in the Ten Thousand Demon Realm. At that time, all the elders had gone to watch and were greatly shocked.Deity Slaying Elder's chicken was already at the Void Amalgamation Realm.The Sect Master of the Blood Fire Heavenly Sect, Liu Bumie, and Xiao Yao were also shocked.Han Jue's image in their hearts grew greatly.\"Master, what breed is it? It doesn't look like a chicken.\" Xun Chang'an couldn't help but ask.The Black Hell Chicken flapped its wings rapidly at the edge of the cliff, raising waves of sword Qi.That's right!Sword Qi!Han Jue taught the Unparalleled Finger Divine Sword to the Black Hell Chicken, and it really learned the technique. When the feathers shot out sword Qi, the lethality was also very impressive.Before Han Jue could answer, the Black Hell Chicken turned his head and scolded him, \"I told you long ago that I'm a phoenix. Did you really think I was a chicken?\"Ever since he had devoured the Zhu Dou, the Black Hell Chicken had transformed from Brother Chicken to Master Chicken.Of course, it called itself that.\"You're not simple, either.

He waved his hand and shouted, \"Han Jue! Long time no see! You still remember me, right?\"Hearing that, Han Jue smiled and said, \"I remember.

They had been constantly on the brink of death.\"We're living quite a carefree life. Wielding a sword, we traveled to the ends of the world. We were quick to repay gratitude and enmity.

Cultivation still requires opportunities. It might not be good to stay in seclusion.\" Zhou Fan smiled and invited.At the same time, he flew towards the Cultivate Diligently Become Immortal Mountain.Han Jue secretly cast a spell and shut the mountain-protecting array formation.The trio quickly landed by the cliff.The purple-dressed woman stared at Han Jue with a burning gaze, making him very uncomfortable.This woman was not simple!Han Jue immediately checked the experts in the Jade Pure Sect and quickly locked onto a name.[Xuan Shishi: Ninth level of the Body Integration Realm, Junior Sister of the Demon Lord]Eh?The Demon Lord's Junior Sister?My little sister-in-law?Han Jue thought to himself.Follow current novels on lightnovelworld.comMo Fuchou cupped his fists and smiled. \"Brother Han, long time no see.
