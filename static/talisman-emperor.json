These were the foundation of the Zhang General Store\u2019s survival. While its business wasn\u2019t great, it benefitted from the small but steady stream of income and was barely able to establish itself within Pine Mist City.\u201cTalisman paper, talisman brush, and ink; it\u2019s impossible to craft talismans without these three materials. It seems simple, but in reality it\u2019s extremely complex. From today onwards, you will all learn how to differentiate between talisman papers, the utilization of the talisman brush, and the composition of the ink. Once you have a solid foundation, I\u2019ll then instruct you in talisman crafting.\u201dOnly now did Chen Xi realize that the store had once again recruited seven or eight talisman crafting apprentices with immature faces. Boss Zhang Dayong\u2019s shriveled voice echoed within the general store.\u201cI\u2019ll give the lot of you a month. If your skill doesn\u2019t satisfy me after the month is over, then go home and play in the mud. You lot must remember that if you want to become a qualified talisman master, studying diligently and training hard is the only way to get there, as no one is able to easily succeed!\u201dThe newly recruited talisman crafting apprentices had gazes that were filled with excitement and eagerness; they were itching to have a go at talisman crafting.\u201cMmm, Chen Xi, you\u2019re here.\u201d Zhang Dayong looked over his shoulder to see Chen Xi and greeted him with a smile on his face.\u201cUncle Zhang, these are the 30 Flamecloud Talismans for today.\u201d Chen Xi pulled out a stack of azure talismans and passed them over.Zhang Dayong waved his hand in dismissal. \u201cThere\u2019s no rush. Since you\u2019re here, then help me teach these little kids. These wages will be calculated separately. Hmmm, how about I pay you 3 spirit stones per hour?\u201dChen Xi nodded after pondering for brief moment. \u201cAlright!\u201d30 Flamecloud Talismans could be sold for 10 spirit stones but required five hours of his time to craft, and thus, if calculated in this manner, three spirit stones per hour was indeed generous.Zhang Dayong smiled before turning to look at the newly recruited talisman crafting apprentices and said in a low voice with a serious expression, \u201cThe Dao of talisman crafting is broad and profound, and to better assist you lot in grasping the rudiments, your senior, Chen Xi, will demonstrate how a first-grade Flamecloud Talisman is crafted. I don't dare speak about anything else, but if I were to speak about the solidity of one\u2019s foundation in talisman crafting, then no one in the entire city is more extraordinary than Chen Xi. In this aspect, even I feel ashamed of my inferiority. You lot should look carefully and learn properly, and be sure to not miss out on this opportunity.\u201dWhoosh!Seven or eight gazes descended upon Chen Xi in unison, but when they noticed that he was only a youth with a haggardly pale expression and was not much older than them, doubt arose within their eyes. Is this fellow really as formidable as Uncle Zhang says?Chen Xi remained unfazed, seemingly unable to notice the subtle changes in the atmosphere around him as he moved forward and arrived before the talisman crafting desk. Here he picked up the light azure talisman paper from the side and placed it flat on the desk before lifting his brush and gently dipping it into the ink. He waved the brush in his hand in a fluid and skillful manner as if he was moving his hand without the need to reflect.The youths hurriedly surrounded Chen Xi when they noticed this scene.Talisman brush in hand, Chen Xi\u2019s disposition seemed to change as his gaze became focused and tranquil. His wrist swayed like a snake, moving the tip of his brush in an agile and graceful manner, rustling as it moved\u2026 Fine and elegant blackish-red lines crept across the Talisman Paper in a natural and smooth manner, seeming to be like wisps of smoke naturally curling into existence.The newly recruited talisman crafting apprentices didn\u2019t blink; they stared wide-eyed at Chen Xi\u2019s wrist, the talisman brush, and the talisman markings slowly coming into form on the light azure talisman paper. A sense of shock slowly arose within their hearts as they watched.Talismans were divided into nine grades. The first-grade Flamecloud Talisman was merely one of the most basic talismans, and thus it naturally was also one of the lowest level talismans. The youths originally didn\u2019t take Chen Xi, who seemed not much older than them, seriously. Chen Xi\u2019s movements were limited and repetitive, but they were filled with a graceful and lively aesthetic combined with precise control. Even though his movements weren\u2019t grand, when the youths witnessed Chen Xi craft a talisman with their own eyes, their hearts were instantly conquered by him.Chen Xi wore a concentrated expression and was completely oblivious to what was going on around him, not noticing the changes in the gazes from the surrounding people. Once he started crafting a talisman, Chen Xi would immerse himself in a profound and tranquil state, and only the fine and intricate talisman markings would remain in his eyes.Zhang Dayong couldn\u2019t help but laugh heartily when he saw the shocked appearances of the youths. Not to mention these newbies, even he himself couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of shock within his heart whenever he saw it with his own two eyes. It was exactly as he had said, Chen Xi had indeed achieved an extraordinary level of skill in terms of attainment in basic talismans.Chen Xi controlled the brush\u2019s tip to dot, flick, hook, stroke, and whirl with sharp and precise force. Following the movement of Chen Xi\u2019s Talisman Brush, a delicate and intricate pattern slowly formed on the thin, light azure pine grain talisman paper.The time it would take for one incense stick to burn passed.Whoosh!The talisman paper shone abruptly, seeming to exhale and inhale before returning to normal.As he laid down the talisman, Chen Xi\u2019s entire body felt sore and uncomfortable; it seemed like it was about to fall apart, and that haggard and handsome face of his was so pale that it almost seemed translucent.Before coming to the general store, Chen Xi had already crafted 30 first-grade Flamecloud Talismans, and thus not only was his True Essence on the verge of depletion, even his mental energy was consumed greatly. Therefore, completing this talisman utterly drained him of his True Essence, and his mental energy was emaciated.The newly recruited talisman crafting apprentices didn\u2019t take note of this, however. They instantly burst into an uproar the moment they saw Chen Xi complete a talisman with such fluidity.\u201cHow formidable! The speed, nimbleness, and precision with which he wielded the brush is really shocking!\u201d\u201cWah! Senior Chen Xi successfully crafted a talisman in one go! Such a success rate can only be described as perfect!\u201d\u201cI must properly ask Senior Chen Xi for advice in the future! I must become proficient in that brush technique!\u201d...However, at precisely this moment, a sarcastic voice abruptly echoed within the store.\u201cHmph, what\u2019s so great about crafting a first-grade basic talisman? If you lot are given five years, you\u2019ll be able to excel in basic talisman crafting like Deadpan Chen too. Why don\u2019t you lot ask Deadpan Chen when he\u2019ll be able to craft second-grade talismans? With his level of skill, all he can do is overawe newbies like you lot.\u201dThe person who said this was a frivolous young man who stood at the general store\u2019s entrance. He had a long and narrow face, a pair of large eyes filled with a sense of disdain, and his arms were crossed over his chest. It was unknown when he arrived.The sounds of praise instantly vanished without a trace upon hearing what the young man said, and the originally burning gazes of reverence of the youths now contained a trace of doubt.He took five years to master first-grade basic talismans? What shitty natural talent!Deadpan Chen, ha, what a vivid nickname\u2026. Wait, so it\u2019s him!The new talisman crafting apprentices were finally able to recall who Chen Xi was, and their gazes emitted a weird sense in unison.The name \u201cDeadpan Chen\u201d was known to every household within Pine Mist City, and Chen Xi was the worthy owner of the title \u201cno.1 jinx.\u201dOn the day of his birth, the Chen Clan, which was originally thought of as a first-rate clan, was annihilated by their enemies in a night. Chen Xi\u2019s grandfather, father, and mother were the only survivors.When he was one year old, his grandfather was bedridden with a severe illness, which eventually led to his grandfather losing his entire cultivation and becoming a cripple. His family was thus forced to move into Pine Mist City\u2019s commoner district.When he was two, his younger brother, Chen Hao, was born, but his mother, Zuo Qiuxue, went missing. Rumor had it that she detested the fallen Chen Clan and couldn\u2019t bear with such an impoverished life, and thus eloped with a young and handsome son of a wealthy family.When he was three, his father, Chen Lingjun, left his family and had not returned since.When he was four, the Su Clan from the southern territory, which had formed a betrothal contract with him since before he was born, dispatched more than ten Golden Hall Realm masters to Pine Mist City. When they arrived, they stood atop the sky and tore the marriage contract to shreds before the eyes of everyone within Pine Mist City before flying off with a swagger.Misfortune after misfortune befell Chen Xi continuously for five years, each more stirring than the previous. Pine Mist City wasn\u2019t large at all, so before long, the name of Chen Xi the jinx seemed to have grown wings and spread throughout the city, and it became known to all.Chen Xi had been reserved since he was young and had a cold and detached expression; no one had seen him smile before. Combined with the dissemination by some busybodies, the nickname \u201cDeadpan Chen\u201d resounded within Pine Mist City.\u201cUncle Zhang, I\u2019ll come again tomorrow.\u201dChen Xi could feel the strange atmosphere around him. That is to say, he grew up under such gazes in these past few years and had long since gotten used to them. He nodded towards Uncle Zhang before turning around and leaving with a calm expression.\u201cHmph!\u201dNot long after Chen Xi left, Zhang Dayong fiercely glared at the young man at the entrance before scolding him. \u201cYun Hong, come with me!\u201dThe youth jolted. \u201cUncle, I\u2026\u201d Before he could explain himself, the young man called Yun Hong noticed that his uncle had long since entered the rear room. As he hurriedly ran to follow, he resentfully muttered, \u201cIncomprehensible. All I did was present some facts about Deadpan Chen. What\u2019s he getting so serious about?\u201dRight after the two of them left, the group of newly recruited talisman crafting apprentices couldn\u2019t help themselves from discussing what they had just witnessed.\u201cHeh, so that was Deadpan Chen. If I knew this earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have come. I wonder if I\u2019ll be contaminated with misfortune if I learn talisman crafting from him.\u201d\u201cAh! Shit! I accidentally bumped into Deadpan Chen earlier when he was crafting the talisman\u2026 This won\u2019t do, I have to hurry home and take a bath.\u201d\u201cHaha, look at how intimidated all of you are. My father said that Deadpan Chen only brings disaster upon the Chen Clan and doesn\u2019t affect us.\u201d\u2026The night sky was as dark as ink and studded with stars.Under the piercingly cold gale, Chen Xi silently loosened his fist, which was clenched to the point where his joints were pale, then tightened the thin clothes on his body as he swiftly walked towards his home.When he was about to reach his home, he spotted a thin figure sitting before the door. Thanks to the starlight, he was able to vaguely discern that the figure was his younger brother, Chen Hao.\u201cBig Brother, you\u2019re home.\u201d Chen Hao, who was only 12, stood up and shouted out in joy before seeming to realize that something was wrong, making him hurriedly lower his head.Chen Xi walked up and said with a voice that contained a trace of sternness, \u201cRaise your head.\u201dChen Hao was like a child that had made a mistake, but he stubbornly refused to raise his head as he spoke nervously. \u201cGrandfather is waiting for you to have dinner. Let\u2019s go inside.\u201dAfter he spoke, Chen Hao turned around and wanted to enter the house, but he was grabbed by Chen Xi from behind.\u201cDid you get into a fight again?\u201d Chen Xi extended his hand to raise Chen Hao\u2019s chin. He frowned slightly when he saw blotches of red and swollen bruises on his younger brother\u2019s small face.Chen Hao forcefully struggled free of Chen Xi and lifted his head, then he loudly said with a gaze that contained as much stubbornness as before, \u201cThey called me a bastard, they called Big Brother a jinx and cursed our family, saying we will all die sooner or later. Of course I had to beat them.\u201dChen Xi jolted, then he gazed at his stubborn younger brother, gazed at the sense of rage and unwillingness on his immature and small face, and an indescribable pain suddenly arose within his heart.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - DeparturePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2 - DepartureChen Hao gazed at his older brother with an anxious and fearful expression and held his breath in fear.His older brother took care of his food, housing, and sent him to cultivate in the best martial school within Pine Mist City. Even the spirit stones that Chen Xi obtained with great difficulty were all spent on him, whereas Chen Xi had always been unwilling to spend even a wee bit of spirit stones on himself.Chen Hao knew that although his older brother seemed frosty, he actually had an extremely good heart and was considerate right down to the most trivial details of himself and his grandfather.Whenever he recalled these malicious nicknames, Chen Hao\u2019s heart would be filled with fury and he would wish for nothing more than to fiercely break the jaws of those people that made fun of his older brother.Chen Hao clenched his tiny fists tightly as he secretly made this decision in his heart.\u201cLet\u2019s go home and have dinner.\u201d Chen Xi came to from his silent state and took a deep breath before patting Chen Hao on the shoulder. He then pushed the old and worn-out door and walked into the house.\u201cBig Brother, you\u2019re not going to scold me?\u201d Chen Hao was stupefied for a moment before joyfully grinning and yelling, \u201cAlright, Big Brother, I was about to starve to death!\u201d\u2026A pine oil lamp flickered with dim rays of light that illuminated the narrow, cramped, and worn-out wooden house.An old man with aged and sparsely scattered hair sat silently at the dining table. His face was full of wrinkles and he had bones that were thin like twigs, as well as a pair of murky eyes that emitted a decaying aura.The old man was Chen Tianli, a figure that once commanded the wind and the clouds within Pine Mist City. Unfortunately, after the annihilation of the Chen Clan, his old illness relapsed, causing his cultivation to be completely crippled and turning him into an ordinary old man.\u201cGrandfather.\u201d Chen Xi silently sat at the table. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh inwardly when he saw the bowl of pickled cabbage and three bowls of rice on the table.\u201cEat.\u201d Chen Tianli\u2019s voice was deep and hoarse. \u201cI have something to say after dinner.\u201dChen Xi jolted before nodding. \u201cOkay.\u201dThe way the group ate was extremely amusing. Chen Xi and his grandfather only ate rice; they gave the small bowl of pickled cabbage to Chen Hao. The little fellow seemed to know that refusing would be of no use, so he immersed himself in eating as he repeated in his heart the pledge that he made a long time ago.After their meal, Chen Hao obediently cleared the dishes, then he picked up a wooden sword and walked out of the house. He wanted to train with the sword; he wanted to use every minute he had and make himself stronger!\u201cWhat level have you cultivated your Violet Sky Arts to?\u201d Chen Tianli\u2019s aged face revealed a trace of gratification when he heard the swishing sounds of sword training from outside the window.The Violet Sky Arts was the Chen Clan\u2019s qi refinement cultivation technique that was handed down from their ancestors. It had a total of 18 levels which recorded in detail the cultivation technique from the 9th level Postnatal Realm to the 9th level Congenital Realm.\u201cStill at the 13th level.\u201d Even when speaking with his grandfather, Chen Xi\u2019s face was as icy-cold as always, and that sedated and stiff aura of his seemed as if it would never change.\u201cOh.\u201d Chen Tianli nodded and made no comment, but in his heart, a trace of complicated feelings poured out.He both loved and hated this grandson of his, because ever since Chen Xi was born, the entire Chen Clan was struck with grievous news non-stop. The clan was annihilated, Chen Xi\u2019s mother abandoned her family and left, Chen Xi\u2019s father left full of hatred\u2026Most loathsome of all was that Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan actually tore apart the previously agreed upon marriage contract before the eyes of everyone in Pine Mist City, causing Chen Tianli to lose face. Were it not for him being concerned that there would be no one to bring up his two young grandchildren, he would wish for nothing more than to commit suicide and end his own life!Sometimes, he would question if his grandson was really as the rumours portrayed, a jinx with misfortune looming above his head. However, he would quickly get rid of this thought, as he and his two grandchildren were the only remnants of the entire Chen Clan. Coupled with his deteriorating body, they could only rely on Chen Xi crafting talismans to barely bring home the bacon.That is to say that it was precisely because of the presence of Chen Xi that their family didn\u2019t stoop to the extent of becoming associated with beggars all these years. Under Chen Xi\u2019s toilsome efforts, his young grandson, Chen Hao, was even able to enter and cultivate in the Skystar Dojo, which was famous within Pine Mist City.A jet of warmth gushed out from Chen Tianli\u2019s heart when he thought up to this point. No matter how misfortunate he was, Little Xi was still his grandson and the flesh and blood of the Chen Clan.\u201cI\u2019ve really made you suffer all these years.\u201d Chen Tianli sighed. \u201cI let Chen Hao eat and wear the best we have, and I even let him enter the dojo to learn martial arts. But I made you work hard to earn a living while not gaining the slightest bit of benefit. Grandfather\u2026has really been unfair to you!\u201dChen Xi\u2019s body stiffened as the grievances that were suppressed deep within his heart for so many years stirred within him. He hurriedly took a deep breath, forcefully suppressing these grievances, then he shook his head and said, \u201cYou\u2019re aged and in poor health, whereas Little Hao is young and ignorant. Thus, these things naturally ought to be done by me.\u201dChen Tianli laughed it off as he waved his hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about all this.\u201dChen Xi nodded and then fell silent.His disposition was dull and unsociable, nor was he good with words. Combined with being subjected to the mocking and ridicule of the people around him all these years, it had caused him to grow reserved, and he would rather go about silently than speaking an extra word.After pondering for quite some time, Chen Tianli abruptly spoke. \u201cDragon Lake City\u2019s Thousand Sword Sect will open its doors to the public in half a month and recruit disciples. I plan to take Little Hao there to try his luck.\u201dChen Xi jolted before saying, \u201cThat\u2019s good as well. Leaving Pine Mist City is more beneficial to Little Hao\u2019s growth.\u201dChen Tianli couldn\u2019t help himself from asking, \u201cYou\u2026 don\u2019t hate Grandfather for showing preference, right?\u201dChen Xi shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll obey Grandfather\u2019s arrangements in everything.\u201dChen Tianli carefully gazed at his grandson\u2019s face, seeming to want to see something in it. What made him disappointed after that was that from the beginning till the end, Chen Xi\u2019s appearance didn\u2019t move in the slightest; it was as if he was a stiff log.Chen Tianli sighed in his heart, then returned to the house.\u2026Early in the morning of the next day, when Chen Xi had just awoken, the day had only just dawned. He used cold water to wash his face and had only just walked out of his room when he saw Chen Hao training with the sword.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!The wooden sword repeatedly emitted sounds of air being torn as it moved about uninhibitedly. Chen Hao held the sword with his right hand, and his thin and weak figure leaped about nimbly as he chopped, slashed, flicked, stabbed, and swept his sword as he scrupulously practiced his swordsmanship.His small face was filled with sweat, but between his immature brows was a sense of staunchness, and the wooden sword in his hand didn\u2019t tremble in the slightest as it moved steadily and skillfully.Chen Xi silently watched for a moment without disturbing his younger brother. After hurriedly preparing breakfast, instead of crafting talismans as usual, he instead quickly dashed towards the Zhang General Store.\u201cAh, Deadpan Chen is here again!\u201d\u201cAlas, I originally thought that I wouldn\u2019t bump into him if I came to work in the morning, but who knew that I would still run into him? Truly misfortunate.\u201dWithin the Zhang General Store, the newly recruited talisman crafting apprentices moved away in succession when they noticed Chen Xi walk in. Their faces were full of the fear of being infected with misfortune.\u201cUncle Zhang, is it alright for me to borrow 100 spirit stones from you?\u201d How could Chen Xi have the mood to pay attention to these fellows who taunted and jeered at him? He directly arrived before the counter and raised his request to Zhang Dayong.Zhang Dayong said, in a questioning manner, \u201cChen Xi, what happened? Tell me and maybe I can be of some help.\u201dChen Xi has helped craft talismans for his general store for more than five years, and he had never once borrowed money from him, but today Chen Xi unexpectedly wanted to borrow 100 spirit stones from him. He was naturally bewildered and thought that if it was something within his ability, he would help the kid out.Chen Xi perceived the sense of care within Zhang Dayong\u2019s words, and his heart was warmed as he said while shaking his head, \u201cI haven\u2019t encountered any trouble; I only want to buy something.\u201dZhang Dayong came to a sudden understanding. He then decisively took out a spirit jade and said, \u201cHere, is it enough? If it isn\u2019t, I can still lend you a little more.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough. Thank you, Uncle Zhang. I\u2019ll repay you quickly.\u201d A spirit jade was roughly comparable to 100 spirit stones, and the exchange rate was only higher, not lower. After Chen Xi received the spirit jade, he turned around and left with hurried steps.Zhang Dayong gazed at Chen Xi\u2019s figure that vanished outside the store and was extremely bewildered.\u2026The Hundred Refinement Hall was situated in a busy district at the center of Pine Mist City. It exclusively sold weapons and equipment that were required by cultivators on a grand scale, and it was rather famous within the city.After Chen Xi dropped by, it wasn\u2019t even 15 minutes before the spirit jade was spent, but he didn\u2019t feel pained at all; a sense of gratification arose within his heart instead.When he returned home, it was already near midday. Chen Tianli was packing their bags, whereas Chen Hao sat before the door with his hands cupping his face, pondering about something.\u201cBrother, you\u2019re back.\u201d Chen Hao stood up with a \u2018whoosh,\u2019 and his small face was filled with joy.Chen Xi rubbed Chen Hao\u2019s head as he asked, \u201cLeaving soon?\u201dChao Hao nodded, and his expression dimmed. He wasn\u2019t willing to part with his older brother, and when he thought of how he wouldn\u2019t be able to frequently see his older brother once he\u2019d gone to Dragon Lake City, he felt extremely sad.Chen Xi took out a rectangular, jade case and passed it over. \u201cI bought this for you; you have to work hard.\u201d\u201cFor me?\u201d Chen Hao was stupefied. He looked at the exquisite, jade case, and for a moment, he didn\u2019t dare believe his eyes.Ever since he was small, whenever he saw the kids of other families flaunting various gifts, he would feel extremely envious, but he didn\u2019t dare have any extravagant hopes of possessing one. Because he knew that the life of his family relied on the toilsome efforts of his older brother in order to maintain their livelihood, and under these circumstances, he didn\u2019t dare crave for it at all.Now, at the moment before he departed, his older brother didn\u2019t say a thing and bought him a present. How could this not make him feel touched?\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Chen Hao\u2019s voice was slightly choked as he lowered his head. He spent a great deal of effort to stop himself from crying, but his eyes were already red.Chen Xi patted his young brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTake good care of Grandfather, and take good care of yourself as well.\u201d\u201cMmm!\u201d Chen Hao fiercely nodded.\u201cI\u2019ll go see to Grandfather, and I\u2019ll escort you two out of the city later.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s face revealed a rare trace of a faint smile as he turned around and walked into the house.Chen Hao took a deep breath as he slowly opened the jade case. Within the case, a longsword that emitted a piercingly cold sheen silently laid there.Om!After holding up the longsword and pouring his True Essence into it, the long sword suddenly emitted a clear and melodious cry, and a trace of a dense, sharp qi gushed out.\u201cBrother, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let you down!\u201d Chen Hao gazed at the longsword in his hand with a firm gaze. It was like he had grown up overnight and was no longer the ignorant child from before.\u2026Outside the city\u2019s gate.At midday, as the sun hung high in the sky, a carriage carried the pair of grandfather and grandson as it slowly sped off.Chen Xi stood atop the city wall. With his gaze focused on something in the distance, his heart rose and fell like the waves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Grievous NewsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3 - Grievous NewsChen Xi thought about the matters in his heart as he silently made his way back home.He didn\u2019t let the departure of his grandfather and younger brother get him down. According to his knowledge, the Thousand Sword Sect in Dragon Lake City was rather famous in the southern territory and the various institutions that were established within Pine Mist City were utterly incapable of comparing to it.Over the past few thousand years, after the perfection of the cultivation system, various novel things appeared on the path of cultivation, and institutions were one of them.These institutions were established within towns and cities. They employed erudite cultivators to instruct students on fundamental cultivation knowledge. These cultivators earned great wealth in this manner.These institutions didn\u2019t reject people based on their social status. Regardless of whether you were a mountain dweller, a slave, a wealthy merchant or a hawker, so long as you paid sufficient spirit stones you would be able to enter the institutions to learn.The types of institutions varied and were divided according to their names.For example, the various institutions established within Pine Mist City included equipment refinement, puppeteering, talisman crafting, alchemy, botany, taming, etc. Prior to this, Chen Hao was learning the fundamentals of swordsmanship in the Skystar Institution.However, the institutions had their own limitations as well, as the knowledge taught was the most foundational and simple knowledge. If one wanted to take more advanced lessons, then they needed to enter a sect.A sect was commonly established within renowned mountains and near great rivers that were rich in spirit energy. They often possessed great cultivators who took up positions in the sect and its conditions for disciple selection were extremely harsh. A person who didn\u2019t possess superb natural talent and a solid foundation would be utterly incapable of passing the sect\u2019s recruitment exams, and thus was far from something those common institutions could compare to.Chen Xi was very clear about the amount of injustices Chen Hao had suffered over the years. Because of him, Chen Hao was mocked as a little jinx by his peers. No one was willing to come into contact with Chen Hao, nor did Chen Hao have even a single friend. Thus, if his younger brother was able to formally enter the Thousand Sword Sect, it would undoubtedly be a joyous occasion for Chen Hao, who was crazy about practicing his swordsmanship. Not to mention, it would be extremely beneficial for his younger brother\u2019s growth.Chen Hao was only 12 this year. Because he was endowed by nature with unusual intelligence, he had cultivated to the level of perfection within the Postnatal Realm a long time ago. Under the devoted guidance of his grandfather, his foundation was incomparably solid. So passing the Thousand Sword Sect\u2019s exam ought to not be a problem.When approaching his house, Chen Xi saw from afar a five or six-year-old girl cupping her chin as she sat before his door. The young girl had a headful of hair that was bundled up into a vertical pigtail, a pair of jet-black glossy eyes and an extremely cute appearance.The young girl ran over when she noticed Chen Xi and excitedly asked, \u201cBig Brother Chen Xi, where\u2019s Little Hao? I brought his favorite lime candy, but he still hasn\u2019t come.\u201dThe young girl\u2019s name was Xixi. She was lively and lovable, but didn\u2019t have a father. She lived with her mother, Bai Wanqing, who had moved to Pine Mist City a few years ago. They were Chen Xi\u2019s neighbors, so the relationship between their two families was extremely good.\u201cHe\u2019s gone to a distant place to acknowledge a master and study under him. He probably won\u2019t be returning for the next few years.\u201dChen Xi rubbed Xixi\u2019s little head. He was extremely fond of Xixi in his heart. The little girl was a few years younger than his brother, and whenever he returned from Skystar Institution, she would be like a puppy that tagged along with Chen Hao to play, occasionally sharing some candy. Thus, the two of them had an extremely good relationship.What was particularly important was that Xixi and her mother never gave Chen Xi\u2019s family the cold shoulder and never regarded Chen Xi as a jinx. This sort of trust that didn\u2019t have any other motives mixed in made Chen Xi value it exceptionally.In a daze, Xixi looked upwards as she asked, \u201cDistant place? Where\u2019s the distant place?\u201dChen Xi thought for a moment before saying, \u201cA place you can\u2019t go to is called a distant place. But once Xixi grows up, you can go there.\u201dXixi replied with an \u201cOh.\u201d before becoming dispirited and putting on a depressed face.Chen Xi comforted her, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come play at my place?\u201dXixi\u2019s gaze shone. \u201cOkay. I want to watch Big Brother Chen Xi craft talismans.\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201d A trace of a smile appeared on the corners of Chen Xi\u2019s mouth when he saw the little girl become happy, but in the blink of an eye he once again recovered that frosty and stiff appearance.Holding on to Xixi\u2019s chubby little hand, Chen Xi walked into his house.\u2026Placed on the table were a pile of light azure talisman papers, an ink tray of blackish-red ink, and a dark talisman brush.Chen Xi fixed his posture to sit up straight before the table. Xixi obediently sat on the small stool at the side with a little face full of curiosity.Chen Xi pointed to the pile of light azure talisman papers as he explained in a light voice, \u201cThese are pine grain talisman papers, the most inexpensive type of talisman paper in the market. It has a stiff texture and rough grain, and it is ordinarily used to craft the simplest basic talismans.\u201dXixi was like a student as she fiercely nodded and said, \u201cBig Brother Chen Xi, I\u2019ve remembered it.\u201dChen Xi chuckled and shook his head before pointing to the tray of blackish-red ink and saying, \u201cThis tray of ink is derived from the blood of a Crimson Flame Deer. The Crimson Flame Deer itself is the one of the lowest class of demon beasts in the world of cultivation. Other than its blood, which can be used as ink for talisman crafting, the rest of its body doesn\u2019t have a shred of value. Even the merchants that specialize in raising and training demon beasts for a living aren\u2019t willing to raise and train this type of useless demon beast.\u201dXixi nodded as she asked, \u201cWhat about that brush?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a talisman brush. There\u2019s a difference in quality among talisman brushes. When crafting a talisman, a superior quality talisman brush will not only draw out smoother strokes and more symmetrical marks, it\u2019s able to increase the success rate of talisman crafting. This talisman brush is a mere ordinary talisman brush. However, it\u2019s sufficient for me.\u201dAs he finished speaking, Chen Xi abruptly noticed that he had a lot more to say than usual today.As he thought up to this point, Chen Xi turned to look at Xixi, but noticed that the little girl was resting her head on the table and had been asleep for an unknown amount of time. A strand of glistening and translucent drool hung from the corner of her mouth.Chen Xi randomly recalled how his younger brother had the exact same appearance when he was younger. He couldn\u2019t help but feel his heart warm as he carefully picked Xixi up and placed her on his bed. He then tucked her in and returned to sit at the wooden table.Without further ado, Chen Xi picked up the brush and stained it with sufficient ink, then he waved it before swinging it to draw a talisman.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!As the tip of the brush, which was stained with blackish-red ink, lightly glided on the empty talisman paper, a fine, red line gushed out from the end of the brush. It was like an intelligent earthworm as it moved along a graceful and smooth trajectory to quickly creep across the light azure pine grain talisman paper.Chen Xi was always serious and concentrated when crafting talismans. His eyes were staring fixedly at the talisman paper beneath his brush and his back was straight, seeming like a spear that could pierce the heavens. His right arm hung in the air motionlessly like a curled and strong section of a pine tree branch that grew wildly out from between the cracks of a tombstone on a cliff. From the beginning till the end, it didn\u2019t shift in the slightest.What moved was his right wrist!His right wrist was extremely nimble as it controlled the talisman brush in his hand to sketch on the paper, then he applied ink onto the talisman paper at a shocking speed. His movements were skilled and smooth; not only did they not give off an unstable feeling in the slightest, they instead seemed like a flowing stream, bringing along an agile and harmonic rhythm.When a complicated and profound pattern quietly bloomed like a flower atop the talisman paper, the talisman paper abruptly shone before dimming down and returning to normal.Without taking a second glance, Chen Xi casually placed the first-grade Flamecloud Talisman aside, then took another blank piece of Pine Grain talisman paper and wielded his brush onto it, unwilling to waste a shred of time.Five years ago, Chen Xi\u2019s grandfather took out the last bit of his savings to allow Chen Xi to study at a talisman crafting institution. Once he successfully grasped the crafting of first-grade basic talismans, talisman crafting became the sole source of income in their household.However, Chen Xi only knew how to craft first-grade basic talismans. This couldn\u2019t be helped because when learning the method of talisman crafting in an institution, merely the first-grade was provided. If one wanted to learn crafting of higher grade talismans, then they would have to sell an arm and a leg to buy the corresponding books. The price was too high, so Chen Xi couldn\u2019t afford it.Even then, Chen Xi was still extremely satisfied.When he just started crafting talismans, he was only capable of crafting five first-grade talismans a day, but now he could craft 30. When converted into spirit stones, 30 talismans were equal to as many as 10 spirit stones. In the past, it was enough to maintain the livelihood of their household as well as pay for Chen Hao\u2019s studies in swordsmanship at the institution.Now that his grandfather and younger brother had gone to the southern territory, only he remained. So long as he lived frugally, it wouldn\u2019t be long before he could collect a good amount of spirit stones. If he did this, purchasing a higher grade talisman crafting book wouldn\u2019t be impossible.Of course, before doing that he\u2019d have to return the 100 spirit stones he owed Uncle Zhang.Time trickled by. Within the cramped and dim room, Chen Xi had a concentrated and focused expression as he bent over the table and wielded the brush with smooth and familiar movements. He was entirely immersed in a type of completely oblivious state. Under this state, that pile of blank Pine Grain talisman paper shifted as time passed, slowly transforming into talismans with complicated and profound patterns.Whoosh~The sky was already dark when Chen Xi finished crafting the last talisman. He carefully placed the talisman brush on the inkstone before heaving a long sigh of relief. Deep exhaustion was revealed between his brows, causing his gaunt face to seem even paler.With his cultivation at the intermediate stage of the Congenital Realm, the True Essence within his body was barely able to sustain him crafting 30 first-grade talismans. If he wanted to craft more, it would only be possible if his cultivation increased and his True Essence rose explosively.It was easy to say, but to Chen Xi, it was exceedingly difficult to increase his cultivation.His natural talent wasn\u2019t bad, and the Violet Sky Arts that was passed down in his family wasn\u2019t something ordinary cultivation methods could compare to. However, his cultivation realm had stagnated at the intermediate-stage of the Congenital Realm for a whole five years without a shred of progress.It was precisely because of this that Chen Tianli placed all hope on Chen Hao, whereas he was arranged to study talisman crafting\u2026.Chen Xi had questioned and was in denial more than once. The struggle, frustration, pain, and sense of loss within were things that only he understood.Knock! Knock! Knock!He heard a burst of light and slow sounds of the door being knocked. Accompanying the sound of door knocks was a woman\u2019s voice that was gentle and pleasant to the ear. \u201cChen Xi, is Xixi at your house?\u201dChen Xi came to from his pondering before opening the door. A woman with an elegant appearance stood outside the door. She was wearing a cloth gown and a hairpin made of chaste tree branches, but it was difficult to hide her body\u2019s graceful charm. It was precisely Xixi\u2019s mother, Bai Wanqing.\u201cAunt Bai, Xixi\u2019s fallen asleep.\u201d Chen Xi said.Bai Wanqing heaved a sigh of relief as she smiled and said, \u201cThe little one didn\u2019t trouble you, right? I\u2019ll carry her back home now.\u201dChen Xi shook his head.Bai Wanqing knew that his disposition was reserved and that he was a man of few words. She chuckled as she entered the house to carry the soundly asleep Xixi out, then she left.However, not long after, the door sounded once again, and this time the sound of knocking was rapid and concentrated like drumbeats.Chen Xi frowned and went to open the door. It was Bai Wanqing, who\u2019d returned with an anxious expression.Right at the moment Chen Xi felt bewildered, Bai Wanqing had already cried out, \u201cHurry! Hurry and go outside the city. It seems your grandfather met with an accident!\u201dChen Xi\u2019s head buzzed as if he was struck by lightning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - EnemyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4 - EnemyChen Xi felt the vital energy and blood in his entire body surge, his head was throbbing and felt like it was about to explode!He was like a cornered wild animal as he madly charged out of his house, out of the residential district, and towards the outside of the city.Unbeknownst to him, he was yelling as he ran down the street.Even though it was late at night, it was still bright as day in Pine Mist City. All kinds of lamps that flowed with multi-colored rays of light hung everywhere in the city. The lamps were brightly lit as if being occupied by fire dragons, clamorous and magnificent.The streets were densely filled with pedestrians, and there was even a large and dense crowd gathered outside the city gates.An emaciated and bony geezer with bloodied clothes and a pair of tightly shut eyes was lying on the ground. He\u2019d obviously been dead for a long time.Beside the body, a 12-year-old child knelt there without a word. There were no tears on his immature face, but his gaze was pale and empty, as if he were a soulless puppet.\u201cI know him, he\u2019s the Skystar Institution\u2019s Chen Hao. We\u2019re in the same school!\u201d\u201cAh! So it\u2019s the jinx\u2019s young brother. The geezer at the side couldn\u2019t be his grandfather, right?\u201d\u201cAlas, it surely is. The Chen Clan\u2019s patriarch that was extremely famous in our Pine Mist City in those years has been killed in the wilderness outside the city. Pitiable! Lamentable!\u201d\u2026The crowd discussed animatedly, but no one was willing to lend a hand because one was the jinx\u2019s younger brother and the other was the jinx\u2019s grandfather. They weren\u2019t willing to be stained with misfortune.\u201cEveryone, move aside. The jinx has come!\u201d A sharp voice abruptly sounded. Upon hearing the voice, the large crowd abruptly opened up a path like they were avoiding the plague.Under the strange gazes of the crowd, a gaunt figure charged over as if he had gone mad. It was obviously Chen Xi.\u201cGrandfather!\u201d Chen Xi thoroughly severed the hopes inside his heart when he saw the familiar figure that quietly lay on the ground. His heart ached as if it had been pierced by 10,000 arrows and his body started trembling involuntarily.As he walked step by step to arrive before his grandfather\u2019s corpse, his stiff and frosty face didn\u2019t change, but his eyes were fully red.\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d An extremely hoarse and low but familiar voice sounded, causing Chen Xi\u2019s mind to shake. What he saw was his younger brother looking at him like a puppet with a pair of empty and lackluster eyes.Chen Xi\u2019s mind was in even more agony. His nails had deeply sunken into his palm and blood was flowing out, but he wasn\u2019t aware at all.How he absolutely hated himself for being too incapable, hated himself for facing the mocking and ridicule from the surrounding people but being powerless to change it\u2026Chen Xi\u2019s heart was roaring in a frenzy and he almost lost control.Bang!Chen Hao seemed to be unable to persist any longer. He weakly shut his eyes before fainting in Chen Xi\u2019s arms.Chen Xi gazed at his younger brother in his arms, noticing the exhaustion and helplessness on his younger brother\u2019s immature face before he abruptly jolted awake from the infinite rage within his heart.He carried his younger brother on his back and his grandfather\u2019s corpse in his arms as he staggered back into the city and made his way home.\u201cThe jinx has finally left. Ha! Look at that, after so many years, he caused his grandfather\u2019s death. Tsk, sure enough, his misfortune is fully raging.\u201d\u201cTalk softly. Do you have a death wish? Careful, you might get stained by misfortune and throw away your life if you continue cursing the jinx!\u201d\u201cChe, talking about me? Didn\u2019t you call him jinx as well?\u201d\u201cHumph, whatever.\u201d\u201cContinue acting. Perhaps in your heart, you\u2019re even thinking of when the jinx will cause his younger brother\u2019s death, right!?\u201d\u2026On the way home, the droning sounds of discussions that were accompanied by the piercingly cold night breeze floated into Chen Xi\u2019s ears. They were like sharp, silver needles that deeply pierced into his heart.Yet he still kept to himself and walked forward like a tombstone that had experienced years of being slapped by the waves of the ocean. The pain went so deep that it pierced his bones, but he was as unyielding as always.\u2026The sky unceasingly rained upon the outskirts of the city.Before a solitary grave mound, Chen Xi stood up and said, \u201cGrandfather, rest in peace,\u201d in a low voice that was calm and dull, yet sonorous and persistent.Chen Xi had knelt before the grave for three days without food or water. He remained completely unmoved under the force of the sun and wind, and his face was ghastly pale and utterly haggard.Seeing Chen Xi return to normal, Bai Wanqing, who stood at the side, secretly heaved a sigh of relief as she said, \u201cGo home, Chen Hao woke up from his coma last night.\u201dChen Xi nodded in agreement.\u201cAunt Bai, thank you.\u201d When they were near his house, Chen Xi stopped and thanked Bai Wanqing with an earnest expression. For these three days, Bai Wanqing was like a relative and was always at his home helping him take care of his younger brother, causing him to be extremely touched.When everyone only knew how to mock him, there was one person that silently rushed about and exhausted themselves for him, and such a person was worthy of Chen Xi always remembering and being grateful to for his entire life.Bai Wanqing did not expect Chen Xi to thank her so earnestly, so she jolted before saying, with a smile, \u201cSo long as you live on properly, and moreover, live better than anyone else, then that\u2019s the best thanks to me.\u201dChen Xi earnestly nodded.Bai Wanqing chuckled and didn\u2019t stay any longer; she turned and left.A trace of warmth couldn\u2019t help but pour out of Chen Xi\u2019s heart as he watched the gentle and graceful figure vanish into the distance. Their talk caused his spirit to be refreshed and the gloominess between his brows lessened considerably.The door swung open, and Chen Hao gazed at Chen Xi as he lightly called out, \u201cBrother.\u201dChen Xi walked forward and firmly hugged his younger brother. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if your right hand is crippled; as long as you\u2019re alive, there\u2019s still hope.\u201dThat night, Chen Xi\u2019s grandfather had fallen victim to an attack and passed away, whereas Chen Hao paid the price of an arm. As the vitality within his right arm was crippled, even if a supreme, miraculous cure that could bring back the dead were to be found for him, it would be of no use.Chen Xi was extremely clear about exactly how much pain the loss of his right hand brought to his younger brother, as his younger brother has been obsessed with swordsmanship since a young age and had once pledged to pioneer a path of his own in the Dao of the sword. Now that his younger brother\u2019s right hand was gone, it undoubtedly thoroughly spelled the end to the dream that his younger brother had held for so many years, and Chen Xi could imagine his pain.\u201cBrother, I\u2019ve already decided to cultivate left-handed swordsmanship!\u201d Chen Hao straightened his back. With a deep and profound gaze, he seemed as if he\u2019d been reborn as he resolutely said, \u201cLosing my right arm is a good thing as well. One arm, one sword. It\u2019ll allow me to be more devoted, and my swordsmanship will be even better.\u201dChen Xi looked at his younger brother, who seemed to have matured overnight, and looked at the renewed resolution that once again radiated on his face. For a moment, Chen Xi\u2019s heart rose and fell like the waves, and he could hardly restrain his emotions. \u201cGood! Good! Good!\u201dA string of saying good thrice had already fully expressed the joy in Chen Xi\u2019s heart.\u2026\u201cGrandfather and I were ambushed at the Azure Wolf Gorge by three masked men. Before his death, Grandfather said that they all possessed Violet Palace Realm cultivation.\u201dAfter their meal, Chen Xi started asking about what he and grandfather encountered after leaving the city, as he wanted to figure out who exactly was the one that killed his grandfather.However, when he heard his younger brother mention three Violet Palace Realm cultivators, Chen Xi\u2019s heart jerked.The path of cultivation was divided like this: Postnatal Realm, Congenital Realm, Violet Palace Realm, Golden Hall Realm, Yin-Yang Golden Core Realm, Rebirth Realm, Nether Transformation Realm, and the Earthly Immortal Realm.The Postnatal Realm was divided into nine stages that cultivated True Essence within the body to clear the arteries and the veins, and it provided an increase in one\u2019s lifespan of 60 years. After arriving at this realm, one would be robust and strong with Blood Essence that surges like a tide, and they will be devoid of disease.The Congenital Realm was also divided into nine stages which practice breathing the energy of the heavens and the earth to cultivate the heart and stabilize the mind, and it provided an increase in one\u2019s lifespan of 100 years. Upon arriving at this realm, one will have cleared and slipped out of their mortal shell to allow the physique to contain spirit; however, among the myriad people in the world, very few were able to step into the Congenital Realm!The Violet Palace Realm steals the energy of heaven and earth to develop a Violet Palace within the Dantian. Every time one\u2019s cultivation level increases, a True Essence star would appear within their Violet Palace, and when nine stars were strung together, the Violet Palace can be considered to have attained perfection.This realm was also called the Realm of Touching Stars. Arriving at this realm provided an increase in one\u2019s lifespan of 500 years. Only after reaching this realm could it be said that a cultivator had established the foundation of cultivating in the Dao and had truly stepped onto the road to immortal cultivation.According to Chen Xi\u2019s knowledge, not even one in 10,000 Congenital Realm experts succeed in establishing a Violet Palace. In Pine Mist City, a Violet Palace Realm cultivator was absolutely the highest tier expert. When he heard that the assailants that killed his grandfather were actually three Violet Palace Realm cultivators, the shock in Chen Xi\u2019s heart was unimaginable.He had only cultivated to the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm, and even this was all thanks to receiving his grandfather\u2019s devoted guidance from a young age.In those days, his Chen Clan was an extremely powerful, prosperous and large clan in Pine Mist City. As the Patriarch of the Chen Clan, Chen Tianli himself was a 7th star Violet Palace Realm cultivator. Even though his cultivation was crippled, the inheritance he possessed wasn\u2019t lost. No matter how ordinary Chen Xi\u2019s natural talent was, with the attentive imparting of knowledge from Chen Tianli, advancing into the Congenital Realm was not worth mentioning.However, his hope to become a Violet Palace Realm cultivator was extremely small. After all, his cultivation had already stagnated at the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm for five years, so it was difficult to say whether he was capable of making an advancement.\u201cRight, I have a Soundsaver Talisman here. It recorded a short conversation between those three people!\u201d Chen Hao abruptly slapped himself on the head as he spoke, then he pulled out a deep blue colored talisman and passed it to Chen Xi.The Soundsaver Talisman was a type of auxiliary talisman. Within the cultivation world, when a cultivator went out, they often left behind a Soundsaver Talisman so they could leave a message to avoid a visiting friend from being unable to find them.This Soundsaver Talisman was something Chen Xi crafted for his younger brother to play with, but he never imagined it would actually be put to such great use. Chen Xi\u2019s heart felt a burst of agitation when he thought about how in a few moments, he might be able to hear the voice of the assailants who killed his grandfather.After pouring True Essence into it, a deep blue colored bright light suddenly emerged from the Soundsaver Talisman\u2019s surface.A sharp and gloomy voice that seemed as if it was a venomous snake flicking its tongue while being hidden in the shadows floated out from within the Soundsaver Talisman.Pop!The Soundsaver Talisman transformed into a wisp of ash that flew into the air and vanished.Chen Xi\u2019s expression was already completely ashen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Jade PendantPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5 - Jade PendantWho\u2019s the Young Master the voice spoke of?Actually murdering my entire family, just for the sake of a marriage?Who\u2019s \u2018that person of the Dragon Lake City?\u2019Chen Xi\u2019s mind pondered crazily. The information the Soundsaver Talisman revealed was too obscure, but there were still small hints; All that he needed to do was find a breakthrough point and then everything else would fall into place!Someone in the Dragon Lake City who was related to me, there was only the\u2026Su Clan!Right, it was definitely the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan!Chen Xi experienced a flash of inspiration as he abruptly thought of a strong possibility.He\u2019d heard his grandfather speak of it before. When he was born, his mother, Zuoqiu Xue, had agreed to a marriage contract with the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan\u2019s Patriarch. The agreement stipulated that when he turned 18, Chen Xi would marry the daughter of the Su Clan\u2019s Patriarch, Su Jiao. However, along with the annihilation of the Chen Clan and the disappearance of his mother when he was 4, the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan had dispatched more than 10 Golden Hall Realm experts to tear the marriage contract to shreds in front of everyone within the Pine Mist City.The Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan also undoubtedly possessed the strength to affect what happened in Pine Mist City and to urge 3 Violet Palace Realm cultivators to abduct and kill his grandfather and younger brother!Right, that\u2019s definitely what happened!The more he thought about it, the clearer Chen Xi\u2019s train of thought became, and he determined that his inference couldn\u2019t be far from the truth.As for the identity of that \u2018Young Master,\u2019 it should be easy to figure out. Such massive movements that spared no pains to tightly encircle Pine Mist City, for the sake of preventing me and little brother from fleeing, is something only one of the great powers within Pine Mist City are capable of.The purpose of them doing this is surely for the sake of that \u2018Young Master\u2019s\u2019 marriage. Perhaps it was in order to unite with the Dragon Lake City Su Clan through marriage, and the union through marriage hinges upon a term of exchange, which was to drive me and little brother to death!Thinking up to this point, Chen Xi felt his entire body go frigid, as though he\u2019d fallen into an icy lake. Tearing up the marriage agreement had already gone over the line, but they actually still wanted to completely extinguish his family. What vile means! What grim hearts!Chen Xi took a deep breath as he strove to remain calm. He began to ponder exactly which power within Pine Mist City the \u2018Young Master\u2019 was from.The southern territory belonged to the Darchu Dynasty, encompassing over 500,000 km of land and containing numerous cities. Pine Mist City was merely an unremarkable little town within the southern territory\u2019s domain, only occupying an area of about 5,000 km.Pine Mist City was also adjacent to the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range where demon beasts ran wild. Furthermore, as it lacked a prosperous area that contained wondrous amounts of spirit energy and ore veins, Pine Mist City was an existence akin to a barren land. Thus, very few great powers occupied Pine Mist City.According to Chen Xi\u2019s knowledge, Pine Misty City was currently controlled by 3 great powers, namely the General\u2019s Estate, the Li Clan, and the Pine Mist Institution.The General\u2019s Estate was a highly disciplined military force that the Darchu Dynasty garrisoned within Pine Mist City. It held the responsibility of upholding the order within Pine Mist City, and thus detached itself from the affairs of the various other powers in the city.The Pine Mist Institution, on the other hand, provided a place of cultivation for the Pine Mist City\u2019s juniors. They accepted and instructed disciples by preaching and dispelling their doubts in cultivation. There were no lack of Violet Palace Realm cultivators within the institution. However, the Pine Mist Institution kept an extremely low-profile and never participated in the struggles between the powers of Pine Mist City.The Li Clan was the only powerful clan that occupied Pine Mist City, and they possessed more than 10 Violet Palace Realm cultivators. After the annihilation of the Chen Clan, the Li Clan\u2019s strength was formidable, to the extent that it became the number 1 clan within Pine Mist City and was extremely influential.Chen Xi\u2019s gaze firmly locked itself onto the Li Clan.Among these three powers, if he were to speak of the power that hated his Chen Clan the most, then it would be the Li Clan without a doubt. This was because before the Chen Clan was annihilated, the two clans were mortal enemies that fought endlessly.It was to the extent that his grandfather suspected that the Li Clan participated in annihilation of the Chen Clan as well.Possessing the strength to lay a tight encirclement outside Pine Mist City and having enmity with my Chen Clan, that \u2018Young Master\u2019 should be a member of the Li Clan!At this point, all of the clues were roughly organized and Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but heave a deep sigh as he said in his heart, \u201c Grandfather, weren\u2019t you always in agony about not knowing who was the sworn enemy that annihilated our Chen Clan? Don\u2019t worry, your grandson has already grasped an important clue. Once your grandson becomes stronger, I\u2019ll take revenge for you! I\u2019ll take revenge for the 1,000 plus members of our Chen Clan!\u201d\u201cBrother, have you guessed the identity of our enemy?\u201d Chen Hao\u2019s small face looked upwards with eyes that were filled with the color of hatred.Chen Xi shook his head, because telling Chen Hao about this matter before he possessed the strength to annihilate the Li Clan would bring nothing but harm.\u201cLittle Hao, since you\u2019ve decided to cultivate left-handed swordsmanship, work hard! Once you\u2019ve become strong, big brother will take you to kill people, to kill our enemies!\u201d Chen Xi patted his younger brother\u2019s shoulder. He had a tranquil expression on his face. \u201cI\u2019ll work hard to become strong as well, and I\u2019ll never let you suffer an injustice in the future!\u201dChen Hao firmly nodded. \u201cBrother, for the sake of Grandfather, for the sake of our Chen Clan, let\u2019s work hard together!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d The brothers looked at each other with firm expressions that seemed to be cut from the same cloth.In the following days, besides crafting talismans to earn spirit stones, Chen Xi devoted practically all his time to cultivating. Although his cultivation had stagnated at the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm for five years, he wasn\u2019t dejected in the slightest and instead cultivated diligently and strenuously like a madman. It was to the point of neglecting sleeping and eating because he wasn\u2019t willing to waste even the slightest bit of time.Dripping water wears through stone. Only with persistence will one be able to see hope!Chen Xi was silent and dull, and he\u2019d always had a wilful and stubborn disposition. Thus, this was how he thought and this was what he did.Chen Hao changed as well. Because he had lost his right hand, the swordsmanship that he\u2019d practiced before was practically crippled. Training with his left hand was undoubtedly no different from beginning anew.He adapted to his left hand with great effort and worked on adjusting the rhythm of his sword movements, consolidating the foundation of his left-handed swordsmanship bit by bit.Beneath the rising sun and beneath the curtain of night, his thin and small figure could be seen spraying sweat as he trained in the sword with great effort!Chen Hao\u2019s natural talent was excellent to begin with, and his foundation was incomparably dense from his grandfather\u2019s teachings. Thus, not even 10 days passed before he\u2019d already completely familiarized himself with utilizing a sword with his left hand. Also, due to his undivided attention on a single hand, he achieved an advancement in the level of his swordsmanship.Most worthy of mention was that during the eighth day of his bitter training, Chen Hao broke through from the perfection stage of the Postnatal Realm and successfully advanced to the Congenital Realm in one fell swoop!The speed at which he advanced made it so that it wouldn\u2019t be long before surpassing his older brother became a possibility.Chen Xi was pleasantly surprised by this, and at the same time he felt a formless pressure envelop himself. What about him? When would he be able to break through the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm?Although his cultivation still stagnated, Chen Xi had other gains. In these past few days, he had completely repaid the 100 spirit stones he owed Uncle Zhang by relying on the spirit stones he earned from crafting talismans. Moreover, there was still a little left over, and this made his mood much better.He\u2019d calculated that after deducting the day-to-day expenses, he would be able to save four spirit stones each day from the spirit stones he earned from crafting talismans. Originally, he planned on accumulating sufficient spirit stones to purchase a book on crafting \u00a0second-grade talismans, but for the sake of advancing his cultivation more quickly he decided to use the spirit stones on cultivating.To Chen Xi, who was accustomed to living an impoverished life, using spirit stones to cultivate was a luxury. After all, for the sake of maintaining their livelihood all these years, he had racked his brains to strictly count and budgeted every spirit stone. He wished for nothing more than to be able to multiply each spirit stone into two before using them.However, for the sake of advancing his cultivation, he couldn\u2019t consider that anymore.The True Essence within Chen Xi\u2019s body was only capable of sustaining the crafting of 30 talismans a day, which at most would earn him 10 spirit stones. Once his cultivation advanced and his True Essence increased rapidly, he would be capable of crafting even more talismans to earn even more spirit stones.Thus, the advancement of his cultivation was all that mattered now!The density of spirit energy in the outside environment was too low after all. Only by earning more spirit stones and using them to cultivate would he be able to allow he and his younger brother to become stronger.With such plans, Chen Xi shared half of the four spirit stones he earned each day with his young brother and used the other half for his own cultivation. However, what made Chen Xi speechless was that after 10 days had passed, even though he used spirit stones to cultivate, the True Essence within his body didn\u2019t grow a shred.Could it be that I\u2019ll be like this my whole life?Chen Xi silently sat cross-legged at the head of the bed at night. Even with his firm and tenacious disposition, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a shred of dejection.Chen Xi was used to sitting in meditation and cultivating when his heart was troubled, as only cultivating would allow him to forget everything.Circulating the Violet Sky Arts, the spirit energy from the outside transformed into strands of True Essence as it flowed into the meridians of his entire body and circulated 18 revolutions before being slowly poured into his Dantian.In the Congenital Realm, a cloud made of True Essence would appear after every increase in level. This was called the cloud stairway of foundation building. When nine clouds were condensed, one could establish their violet palace and become a Violet Palace Realm cultivator that possessed the Dao foundation to officially enter the realm of immortals.The Violet Sky Arts contained 18 levels in total and was a cultivation technique that was handed down in the Chen Clan. Chen Xi had cultivated it since he was a child, and he had already cultivated up to the 13th level, meaning his cultivation was at the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm. Three violet clouds had already been condensed within his Dantian and floated within it as they drew upon the traces of True Essence within the meridians throughout his body.Kacha!After a long time, when his body was full of True Essence, Chen Xi ceased cultivating and was just about to go to bed when he abruptly heard an extremely fine cracking sound. Although the sound was soft, in this silent night, it seemed extremely clear.Seeking the source of the sound, his gaze quickly descended onto a longevity lock that was hanging on his chest. This was something his mother had placed around his neck when he was born. It was meant to help him grow up in peace without suffering and difficulties.This longevity lock was also the one and only thing Chen Xi possessed that was related to his mother, so he treasured it extraordinarily. However, at this moment, numerous cracks silently appeared like a spider web atop the surface of the longevity lock, and he couldn\u2019t help but lament in his heart.What\u2019s going on? Why would cracks appear on the longevity lock for no reason at all?Chen Xi extended his hand to touch the longevity lock, but to his surprise, his fingertip had only just touched it when innumerable cracks abruptly covered the entire surface of the lock. After a clear ding, the surface of the longevity lock shattered into innumerable fragments that fell and scattered all over him, revealing a matte black jade pendant!There was actually a jade pendant inside the longevity lock?Chen Xi could only feel his mind flood with thoughts and was unable to think them through as he sized up the jade pendant in a daze. The matte black jade pendant was roughly the size of a longan[1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longan.] with a perfectly round and crystal-clear appearance; it seemed like an extremely high quality black pearl.Could it be that this is a present Mother left for me? But if that\u2019s really the case, why did she have to conceal it within my longevity lock?Om!Right at the moment Chen Xi was bewildered, a burst of primitive and melodious chanting faintly sounded, like spring water that was gurgling out of a brook, light and pleasing to the ear. Following the sound was a trace of a dazzling, white light that suddenly surged out from the surface of the jade pendant!After a short moment, billions of dense white lights flew out of the pendant and completely illuminated the entire room, the white light revolving and drifting like mist, seeming like a scene in a dream.Chen Xi felt like he was within a dream. Just when he was at a loss for what to do, the white lights before him abruptly roiled violently. Gradually, a woman wearing a white dress that was condensed from light appeared out of thin air!The woman was wearing a fluttering white dress and had features that were as pretty as a picture. She seemed refined and beautiful with a pair of large, sparkling, clear black eyes, emitting an air of liveliness and mischievousness.A \u00a0feeling that was both unfamiliar and familiar abruptly arose within Chen Xi\u2019s heart when he saw her, and he felt a trace of long lost intimacy. He couldn\u2019t help but be curious about who this woman was and why would she cause him to feel such a tricky feeling.\u201cMmm, my darling son, we finally meet again!\u201d The white-clothed woman had her hands behind her back as she mischievously blinked her eyes at Chen Xi and spoke with a happy smile. Her clear and melodious voice that was pleasing to the ears was like a tinkling stream, vivacious and light-hearted.Chen Xi\u2019s eyes abruptly opened wide after hearing what she said as he gazed at the white-clothed woman in horror. His face was full of disbelief, not having his usual sedated and indifferent appearance.She\u2026 Is she really my mother, Zuoqiu Xue?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 - The ManorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6 - The ManorChen Xi was muddled and his head went blank.This refined and beautiful, mischievous and vivacious woman before my eyes actually said she\u2019s my mother, she\u2026 she\u2026Chen Xi felt a surge of emotion and was slightly at a loss for what to do. There was no word that could accurately describe his current state of mind.His mother vanished when he was two and thus there wasn\u2019t a shred of an impression of her within his mind. Coupled with him hearing some bad rumors and gossip about his mother since a young age and his grandfather\u2019s silence on the matter, even if he had a greater yearning to understand his mother\u2019s past, he still had no choice but to bury these feelings deep within his heart.That\u2019s right, deep within his heart.Because he was afraid that his mother was really like what the rumors described, that she detested his Chen Clan, abandoned his father, himself, and his younger brother, and eloped with a young and handsome son of a wealthy family.He was afraid that if the truth was like that, he wouldn\u2019t be able to control himself and would completely go mad.Throughout these years, he\u2019d thought of his mother more than once and forced himself to forget her afterwards. The suffering and bewilderment during this process was completely unimaginable to others.\u201cMy darling son, are you surprised to see your mother so young and beautiful? Is it difficult to accept?\u201d The white-dressed woman giggled and blinked her eyes. \u201cWhy, if it was me, I\u2019d definitely be unable to accept it as well. Can your mother help it that she\u2019s skilled in retaining her youth?\u201d\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t have much time left.\u201d The white-dressed woman paused for a moment and retracted her smile before continuing, \u201cListen well, my son. You must commit to heart what I\u2019m about to say next, or else we will probably never have a chance to meet.\u201dChen Xi\u2019s heart trembled when he heard her, so he calmed his numerous and disorderly thoughts.The white-dressed woman\u2019s eyes revealed a sense of nostalgia, and her beautiful face kept changing between rage, helplessness, bitterness, resentment\u2026and so on and so forth.She eventually said, \u201cI was taken away by your uncle because my family didn\u2019t agree to my marriage with your father. Because of me, and for the sake of upholding the reputation of their Zuoqiu Clan, they didn\u2019t hesitate to annihilate the entire Chen Clan just for the sake of expunging this humiliation.\u201dSo mother didn\u2019t elope with someone but instead was taken away by my uncle\u2026Chen Xi seemed to have freed himself of the shackles that he\u2019d carried for over 10 years, and his mood couldn\u2019t help but ease up. However, the last part of what she said caused his mood to fiercely fall into a bottomless chasm before it had time to wildly rejoice.It was actually the Zuoqiu Clan that Mother\u2019s from that annihilated my Chen Clan?Chen Xi\u2019s breathing was hurried and his chest felt like a 5,000 kg boulder was pressing down upon it. Due to the violent change in his feelings, his eyes went black and he nearly fainted.He\u2019d spent every waking moment over these past 10 plus years pondering the identity of the perpetrator of his Chen Clan\u2019s annihilation. He\u2019d decided in his heart that no matter the difficulties and dangers he would face, he\u2019d definitely kill every single one of them. But never in his wildest dreams did he imagine that the truth would actually be so unbelievable and so atrocious!\u201cSon, you\u2019re really furious, right? Mom\u2019s furious as well! Mom had already broken off all relations with the Zuoqiu Clan long ago and had even paid the price, but they just refused to let Mom go.\u201dZuoqiu Xue\u2019s voice went lower and lower and gradually got more serious. \u201cThe reason is extremely simple: it\u2019s because Mom and your dad obtained an extraordinary treasure during one of our travels to experience the vicissitudes of life.\u201d\u201cLook, that\u2019s precisely it.\u201d She pointed with her delicate hand at the jade pendant that revolved with white lights, and endless pain and hatred emerged within her eyes.Chen Xi raised his head to look over and his gaze went dull. At this moment, his mind was approaching numbness, and he relied on the last strand of intellect within him to listen to Zuoqiu Xue.\u201cHave you heard of the River Diagram? It was the most mysterious diagram in the primordial era. Numerous gods and devils of the primordial era used it to comprehend their own path in the Dao. They peeked into the secrets of the heavens to master the profound meaning of the Grand Dao and ascended to the highest summit of the Dao. It was precisely because of this that every appearance of the River Diagram was accompanied by slaughter. This slaughter caused upheaval within the three dimensions and disturbed the six paths of reincarnation. That doomsday-like scene of various figures with remarkable ability fighting over the River Diagram, just thinking about it sends a chill down one\u2019s spine.\u201d\u201cLuckily, the River Diagram vanished after the end of the primordial era, and that terrifying scene of gods and devils entangled in battle never appeared again. It\u2019s probably been 1,000,000 years since then. If it wasn\u2019t for Mom having read the ancient books of the clan when I was young, I would be completely unaware of the River Diagram\u2019s name,\u201d Zuoqiu Xue tirelessly spoke with a low and serious voice that carried a trace of nostalgia with it.However, when Chen Xi heard it, it was like listening to an ancient legend, so it couldn\u2019t cause a ripple within his heart. An incident from 1,000,000 years was too far away, so far away that it was completely unable to arouse a shred of interest within him to understand it.All he knew was that the River Diagram was a treasure, a treasure that could make everyone slaughter each other madly.\u201cConcealed within this jade pendant is a rubbing of the River Diagram\u2019s stone inscription, and a trace of the River Diagram was branded onto it during the rubbing process. Don\u2019t look down on this brand, because with it, one is capable of locating where the River Diagram is concealed. The reason mom was taken away and our Chen Clan was annihilated is precisely because of this jade pendant!\u201dZuoqiu Xue\u2019s subsequent words were instead like a warhead detonating within his mind, completely stunning Chen Xi. His eyes stared fixedly at the jade pendant in \u00a0astonishment.If it was said that he took the River Diagram as an ancient story before, then at this moment, he abruptly noticed that he\u2019d actually been fortunate enough to be associated with a trace of the River Diagram\u2019s karma!He didn\u2019t know whether he should feel fortunate or begrieved, but he already understood everything. The annihilation of the Chen Clan, his mother leaving and the disappearance of his father\u2026even the name of jinx, it was all thanks to the jade pendant. If it wasn\u2019t for the conflict over it, how else would such a tragedy occur to his entire family?This is probably how a man\u2019s wealth is his own ruin from inducing the greed within another!Chen Xi deeply sighed in his heart with endless frustration.\u201cSupposedly, there\u2019s a cultivation manor that belonged to a primordial being within the jade pendant. Its interior was made into a dimension of its own that contains various profound places and items concealed inside, and the River Diagram\u2019s rubbing is only one of these items. Unfortunately, Mom has never entered it and merely knows of this.\u201d\u201cI assume your cultivation is at the Congenital Realm since you\u2019re capable of evoking the spiritual brand Mom left within the jade pendant. Thus, you\u2019re already capable of establishing ownership of the jade pendant. Keep it! Work hard!\u201dThe silhouette of the white-dressed woman gradually dimmed down and blurred. It seemed as if it would shatter into pieces in the next moment. Even her voice became hurried. \u201cSon, you must remember that under no circumstances should you tell anyone about the jade pendant until you\u2019ve become formidable, including your younger brother. If you do, it will destroy the hope of our Chen Clan!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Mom\u2019s safety. As long as your strength reaches the Heavenly Immortal Realm, you\u2019ll be able to meet Mom.\u201dHer voice lingered in the air as the silhouette of the white-dressed woman completely shattered and vanished without a trace, the jade pendant that hung from his chest then returning to normal.The room once again sunk into darkness and Chen Xi only felt as if he\u2019d had a dream. But the voice still endlessly lingered at the bottom of his heart, and the jade pendant that hung on his chest told him that this was no dream, but reality!He silently sat there in the darkness, and only after a long time did his lips lightly tremble as he muttered, in a soft voice, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mother, your son will definitely find you!\u201d\u2026Chen Xi lost all desire to sleep, so he went and washed his face with cold water. After he became clear-headed once again, he directed his gaze onto the jade pendant on his chest.After experiencing everything from before, he understood that his cultivation had stagnated at the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm for these five years precisely because of this jade pendant.The jade pendant had silently siphoned away his True Essence until today, when the energy within it finally reached saturation and was capable of awakening his mother\u2019s spiritual brand. From the silhouette of his mother that he saw today, he found out about the matters that he\u2019d been puzzled about all this time.He finally found out that he wasn\u2019t a jinx at all, that his natural talent wasn\u2019t bad at all, and most importantly, he found out that his mother was still alive. Chen Xi was filled with inspiration because he knew that as long as he became stronger, he would be able to find his mother!Heavenly Immortal Realm?So long as I\u2019m alive, the day will come when I\u2019m capable of establishing my Violet Palace, charge into the Golden Hall, condense my Ying-Yang Golden Core, break through Rebirth, become an Enlightened Nether Transformation Master, experience the heavenly tribulations to become an Earthly Immortal, and comprehend the Grand Dao to ascend to the Immortal Dimension to become a Heavenly Immortal!So long as I\u2019m alive, the sworn enemies that killed my grandfather and took away my younger brother\u2019s right arm, not one of you shall escape!Chen Xi took a deep breath, and his gaze was steadfast and unwavering.\u201cA manor that a primordial being used to cultivate is actually within this jade pendant, and even the River Diagram rubbing is within. I wonder what profound places and items are inside it? According to what Mother said, the seal on the jade pendant has already been released, and my Congenital Realm cultivation is already capable of establishing ownership of the manor. I wonder if it\u2019s true\u2026?\u201dChen Xi recalled his mother\u2019s words and hesitated for a moment, then he resolutely gritted his teeth, divided a portion of the True Essence within his body and poured it into the jade pendant.A trace of a gentle luster gushed out from the surface of the jade pendant and revolved, then \u00a0converged to form a deep and quiet black hole.At almost the exact same time, a suction force that could not be resisted gushed out from within the black hole. Chen Xi was caught off guard and it was too late to struggle, so his entire body was drawn into the black hole.Om!The black hole broke apart bit by bit and vanished.The entire room sunk into darkness once more and then returned to normal; however, Chen Xi was nowhere to be found.\u2026Chen Xi was standing on a vast and magnificent space. An array of stars flickered and fluttered atop the sky above him like a group of fireflies that fluttered about in the air. A chilly, silver light that was like a waterfall gracefully shone down, giving off an unreal feeling.Beneath his feet was a soft, dark green grassland that stretched out into the distance without an end.He was standing all alone under the night sky filled with an array of stars. The starlight coiled around his body like fireflies; it was as if he was in the wilderness, and everything seemed so unreal.Could this be that primordial being\u2019s cultivation manor?Chen Xi scanned his surroundings, but he didn\u2019t notice a single building that could be considered a manor. On top of his bewilderment, he couldn\u2019t help but secretly become vigilant.The unknown is the fundamental source of fear. It was precisely because of this that Chen Xi didn\u2019t dare to carelessly move about and gathered absolute concentration as he carefully watched his surroundings.After standing there for a long time, Chen Xi\u2019s legs became sore, but the surroundings still remained quiet without a single sound, as though there were no other living beings besides him here.\u201cCould it be that this manor doesn\u2019t exist at all?\u201d Chen Xi lay on his back atop the thick grass as he gazed at the dense array of stars in the sky that flickered and fluttered about. He couldn\u2019t wrap his head around it.Something\u2019s off!Not everything within this space is inanimate, and those stars... Aren\u2019t they revolving endlessly as if they\u2019re alive? The stars in the outside world don\u2019t fly around like this!Chen Xi\u2019s eyes sprang wide when he realized this, and he gazed fixedly at the array of stars that fluttered in the sky and carefully observed them.The sky was like a veil with dazzling stars sprinkled all over. The stars were moving around in an infinite variety of trajectories that were unique to themselves and with varying speeds. They followed a complicated and profound trajectory as they whizzed and whirled in the air.If it was an ordinary person in his place, they would probably be dazzled the moment they saw this scene, but Chen Xi was fascinated as he gazed upon it.Using a myriad of stars as the tip of a brush, using the veil of the night sky as the talisman paper, the drawing of the brush seems to be in a chaotic state, but it\u2019s actually orderly. Not only does it guarantee the individual stars\u2019 continuous movement, they move about in harmony, full of life and vitality. Truly extraordinary\u2026 Chen Xi, who was immersed in his fascination, didn\u2019t notice that the spots of chilly starlight that shone down from above were slowly converging into a diagram\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Ji YuPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7 - Ji YuChen Xi was immersed within a myriad of profound emotions.He had forgotten his surroundings as well as his current location; only the trajectory of the millions upon millions of stars that cycled endlessly could be seen within his eyes. The length and thickness of these trajectories varied, perhaps intricately winding, perfectly straight like a spear, bending in arcs, or even spiralling in circles. It seemed like talisman markings with varied strokes.Chen Xi seemed to be able to see an indistinct hand of giant proportions. It used the sky as talisman paper, the millions upon millions of stars as a talisman brush, and a talisman crafting technique beyond imagination to freely create extraordinary and profound talisman markings that were difficult to comprehend.He couldn\u2019t help himself from wanting to exclaim in admiration, but was utterly speechless. He wanted to commit the trajectories to memory, but noticed that those trajectories seemed to possess traces that could be followed, only, he didn\u2019t know how. Hence, he didn\u2019t fret about it nor pay any more attention to it. He purely observed and admired. Following this, his mind became tranquil, his thoughts clear and peaceful.Om!The hum of strange chanting slowly increased in volume and gradually began to resound through the entire heaven and earth.The icy rays of light from the million upon millions of stars converged together, transforming into a scroll painting which emanated with clear light. Accompanied by the strange chanting, the scroll painting abruptly released infinite streams of light which engulfed the entire sky, carrying away the stars that filled the sky and returning it to the scroll painting!Whoosh!The scroll painting bundled up into a bind before transforming into a wisp of clear light with a speed that was visible to the naked eye. Shockingly, as It burst forth, its direction was precisely where Chen Xi stood.A trace of fear abruptly arose within Chen Xi\u2019s heart before he startled from his completely oblivious state. However, before he could react, he only felt his head buzzing. In the next moment, an enormous statue of a skinny old man appeared within his sea of consciousness. The old man was barefooted and wore linen clothes; his white hair drooped down, and he sat cross-legged in the air as he looked up into the distant sky with a gaze that was as deep and profound as a star.This enormous statue of the old man was entirely simple and unsophisticated, but emitted traces of a vast and aged aura, causing one\u2019s entire mind to involuntarily be drawn to it.Chen Xi gazed at the scene before him in shock before immediately closing his eyes and pondering within his heart.\u201cHow many years has it been? A disciple that is capable of inheriting Master\u2019s mantle has finally appeared! Hahahaha!\u201dA low and hoarse voice abruptly resounded in his ears. Chen Xi\u2019s body trembled and he was unable to ponder anything else as he quickly opened his eyes. When he saw the scenery around him clearly, he couldn\u2019t help but be extremely startled.The night sky that was studded in stars had disappeared and a large river that moved like a great floor had appeared on the boundless delicate green grassland. The river surged with waves, and water splashed in all directions. The long river stretched forward, its end beyond \u00a0sight. In the centre of the large river stood a lone mountain that shot straight into the sky, it\u2019s exterior dark and surface barren.Suddenly, a monster with a single horn walked out from within the large river. It had the body of a lion and the head of a dragon. \u00a0Each giant cloven hoof was the size of a pillar and stood on clouds. Its entire body was covered in dense scales that were jet-black, its eyes were clear and gave off a sense of experience that had insight into all things on earth.Qi\u2026Qilin?[1. A Qilin is a mythical creature that\u2019s thought to occasion prosperity and serenity. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qilin ]Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but let out a breath of cold air when he saw this monster and felt the terrifying aura that was emitted from its body, his heart thumping wildly.He\u2019d only seen the description of a Qilin in books. Allegedly, a Qilin was one of the famous divine beasts in the primordial era. Innately capable of manipulating the 5 elements and possessing great wisdom, even within the primordial era where gods and devils moved about freely, there were few that dared offend a Qilin, thus showing how terrifying its strength was.At this moment, a monster that was similar to a Qilin appeared before him, even Chen Xi whose disposition had been tempered to be firm and tenacious like a rock since long ago, still felt a burst of inexpressible nervousness.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be afraid. I\u2019m the spirit of the Manor, and my Master gave me the name Ji Yu. I\u2019ve been looking after the Manor for my Master for over 1 million years.\u201d The low and hoarse voice sounded once more, but resounded out from within the mouth of the monster that seemed like a Qilin.Chen Xi slightly heaved a sigh of relief, before abruptly realizing that if the monster before him had actually lived for 1,000,000 years,\u201cJunior Chen Xi greets Senior. May I ask Senior, is this really the place of cultivation of the primordial being?\u201d Chen Xi respectfully asked. Even if it was really a monster before him, it still wasn\u2019t an existence he could be disrespectful to.\u201cPrecisely, this is indeed my Master\u2019s place of cultivation.\u201d Ji Yu walked forward and sized up Chen Xi for a moment, then spoke in surprise and bewilderment, \u201cCongenital Realm? Your strength is so weak. How is it possible that you\u2019re able to obtain the true essence of my Master\u2019s inheritance?\u201dChen Xi asked in puzzlement, \u201cWhat true essence of inheritance?\u201dJi Yu, however, paid no attention to him and bitterly pondered for a long time, then abruptly said, \u201cKid, you\u2019re a qi refiner that sought the Dao through use of talismans?\u201dChen Xi was perplexed as he shook his head and said, \u201cI merely know how to craft some basic talismans.\u201dJi Yu had an expression of sudden enlightenment as he sighed and said, \u201cRight enough, Master originally sought the Dao through deducing the secrets of heaven. Choosing you to inherit his mantle is within reason.\u201dChen Xi was even more bewildered and couldn\u2019t stop himself from saying, \u201cSenior, what\u2019s actually going on? When did I inherit his mantle?\u201dJi Yu stared at Chen Xi with a bizarre gaze as he said, \u201cYou possess a strand of the True Body Brand of my Master within your sea of consciousness. Could it be that you\u2019re unaware?\u201dChen Xi recalled the statue of the old man that emitted a vast and aged aura within his sea of consciousness, and couldn\u2019t help but say in astonishment, \u201cThat grandpa is your Master?\u201dJi Yu was startled and shook his head as he sighed, \u201cLooks like you indeed know nothing.\u201dChen Xi was embarrassed in his heart, but respectfully said, \u201cI hope Senior is able to inform me.\u201dJi Yu was silent for a long moment, then slowly opened his mouth to say, \u201cA million years ago, my Master once stipulated that when he left, that only one who was capable of obtaining his True Body Brand within the Star Secret Realm\u2019s test is qualified to inherit his mantle. And you are the only one within all these years. In other words, you already possess the qualification to become my Master\u2019s disciple.\u201dChen Xi suddenly realized that the entire sky filled with stars that he saw earlier was probably the Star Secret Realm.Seeming to have seen through Chen Xi\u2019s thoughts, Ji Yu grunted coldly, \u201cDo you know how many experts have wanted to obtain my Master\u2019s True Body Brand over the course of a million years?\u201d\u201cI can tell you precisely, an entire 6,983 people! Among these people are experts at the Rebirth Realm, Nether Transformation Realm, Earthly Immortal Realm, and even peerless experts at the Heavenly Immortal Realm weren\u2019t a small number! Even the person with the lowest cultivation was at the Yin-Yang Golden Core Realm. Now, do you think it\u2019s simple?\u201dNot waiting for Chen Xi to speak, Ji Yu arrogantly raised his head as he said coldly, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you using the heart of one who possesses the Dao of talismans to comprehend the Star Secret Realm, and also possessing pretty good comprehension, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019d have been minced to death by the Star Universe!\u201dChen Xi was struck with terror as he said in shock, \u201cMinced to death by the Star Universe?\u201dJi Yu nodded, \u201cRight, the Star Secret Realm is peerlessly profound, and covers all phenomena of the universe. If one is unable to leave the Star Secret Realm within an hour, then one would surely be buried within, and one\u2019s soul and spirit will disperse.\u201dSpeaking up to here, Ji Yu slightly sighed with emotion, \u201cThose capable of entering the Manor are all experts of that age that possessed extraordinary strength, however, more than half of them still fell within the Star Secret Realm, and only a handful of people successfully walked out of the Star Secret Realm. These people were similar to you, and comprehended some of the truth of the Dao that Master left behind within the Star Secret Realm. But unfortunately, there\u2019s no one before you that was able to obtain the True Body Brand that Master left behind, and naturally weren\u2019t fated to possess the qualification to become my Master\u2019s disciple.\u201dChen Xi asked wonderingly, \u201cWhat happened to those people? How would they be willing to leave?\u201dJi Yu said coldly, \u201cOf course they weren\u2019t willing. Originally, the truth of the Dao they\u2019d comprehended from within the Star Secret Realm was already sufficient for them to study throughout their life and obtain boundless benefits. But, there were still some among them that were too obstinate, and attempted to obtain my Master\u2019s inheritance. So they stubbornly ascended the Heavenpeak of Trials, and in the end their body and spirit were annihilated.\u201dSpeaking up to here, Ji Yu faced the large river and pointed at the lone mountain at the center of the large river, \u201cLook, that\u2019s the Heavenpeak of Trials, and is divided into 18 levels of trials. Only by passing through all the trials would one be able to obtain the complete inheritance my Master left behind. Most of those people that stubbornly ascended the Heavenpeak of Trials died in the first 3 trials, whereas the most formidable amongst them, a peerless sword immortal from 100,000 years ago that had a cultivation that attained the peak of the sword Dao, was only capable of arriving at the 13th level of the trials before falling to his demise.\u201dChen Xi shuddered with fear as he listened, and couldn\u2019t help but asked as he gazed at the lone mountain at the centre of the large river, \u201cThen if I want to obtain the complete inheritance, do I need to pass all the 18 trials of that Heavenpeak?\u201d\u201cOf course. But you aren\u2019t the same as them, as you\u2019ve obtained my Master\u2019s True Body Brand. You will only be injured while ascending the trials of Heavenpeak, and will not face a threat to your life.\u201d Ji Yu casually said.Chen Xi secretly heaved a sigh of relief, as he couldn\u2019t help but be worried since even that peerless sword immortal lost his life at the 13th level of the trials. He who only had a cultivation at the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm would probably be unable to pass even the 1st level.Ji Yu reminded, \u201cEven though there\u2019s no threat to your life, I\u2019ll still advise you against trying to pass the trials now. Your strength is too weak after all, even to the extent you have the weakest strength I\u2019ve seen in my entire life. I\u2019m not ridiculing you, but placed in the primordial era, a fellow like you would merely be slightly stronger than a newborn infant.\u201dChen Xi was unwilling to accept it in his heart, but when he thought about how the being before him was a monster that had lived for a million over years, he could only deeply bury this unwillingness at the bottom of his heart and ask, \u201cSenior, then when will I be able to pass the 1st level of the Heavenpeak of Trials?\u201dJi Yu was startled and asked wonderingly, \u201cTell me. Why are you so eager to pass the trials?\u201dChen Xi replied without a shred of hesitation, \u201cI want to become strong, to take revenge for my grandfather, to take revenge for my Chen Clan, and I want to become a Heavenly Immortal to meet my mother!\u201dJi Yu came to a sudden understanding and pondered for a moment, then said slowly, \u201cNow that you\u2019ve obtained my Master\u2019s True Body Brand, so long as nothing unexpected happens, there will surely come a day that you\u2019re able to fulfil your desire. But your body is incomparably frail and your cultivation is pitiably weak. If you want to cultivate to the Heavenly Immortal Realm, it will probably be a long journey.\u201dChen Xi\u2019s gaze was steadfast as he said calmly, \u201cNo matter how difficult, I\u2019ll never give up. I will absolutely not give up!\u201dJi Yu\u2019s eyes that had experienced the many vicissitudes of life flashed with a trace of admiration, then lifted his head to gaze at the Heavenpeak before saying arrogantly, \u201cYou\u2019re the one and only person in a million years that obtained the True Body Brand my Master left behind. So long as you cultivate diligently, not to mention revenge or becoming a Heavenly Immortal, even going further is something that\u2019s within reason. In those days, my Master had mastered the Grand Dao, and walked upon the\u2026\u201dThe voice stopped abruptly as Ji Yu seemed to have realized something and held his tongue.Chen Xi however didn\u2019t notice all this, as he was just pondering about what secrets were actually held within the True Body Brand within his sea of consciousness that the Master of the Manor left behind, and how it would help him become strong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - Fuxi Divine StatuePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8 - Fuxi Divine Statue\u201cThis strand of his True Body Brand that my Master left behind is called the Fuxi Divine Statue,[1. Fuxi is a hero in Chinese legend and mythology who\u2019s credited with creating humanity and inventing hunting, fishing and cooking. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuxi ] and it contains my Master\u2019s comprehension on the numerous secrets of the Grand Dao. By constantly visualizing and comprehending it, not only would it allow your soul to strengthen with each passing day, it\u2019s also beneficial towards your comprehension of the Grand Dao. Most importantly, since you possess this strand of True Body Brand, you\u2019re able to cultivate the supreme body refinement technique: Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts!\u201dBefore Chen Xi could even speak, Ji Yu seemed to have already seen through Chen Xi\u2019s thoughts and slowly said, \u201cBack in the primordial era, everyone thought that my Master had observed the River Diagram to deduce the profound meaning behind the cycle of the secrets of heaven in order to gain sudden comprehension of the Grand Dao and ascend to the peak realm. No one knew that my Master\u2019s entire body had already attained transcendence before he had even started to observe the River Diagram. His body refining arts were even sufficient to establish his own orthodoxy to last for generations.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, my Master left in too much of a hurry and only managed leave behind the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts.\u201dJi Yu fell silent after he finished, seemingly immersed within an endless recollection of memories as he sighed silently.Chen Xi silently digested the information that Ji Yu had divulged moments ago, his heart surging like the waves. He momentarily forgot how to speak, but eventually found the nerves to ask : \u201cSenior, I heard someone say that a River Diagram rubbing is concealed within this Manor, I wonder if it\u2019s true?\u201dJi Yu was startled, and his gaze was fixed at Chen Xi as he said with a strange voice, \u201cEven now, you still don\u2019t understand? The strand of True Body Brand was left behind by my Master after observing the River Diagram to comprehend the secrets of heaven, and originally contained a strand of the River Diagram\u2019s True Essence. Now that you\u2019ve obtained the True Body Brand, it\u2019s equal to having obtained a strand of the River Diagram\u2019s True Essence. What\u2019re you thinking of the rubbing for?\u201dChen Xi came to a sudden realization, so the River Diagram rubbing was just a snowball of rumors. The genuine River Diagram\u2019s True Essence was actually held within the True Body Brand of the Master of the Manor.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ve told you all that I can. Do you have any other questions?\u201d Ji Yu swayed his head of a dragon and had a rather friendly bearing; obviously he\u2019d taken Chen Xi as a worthy successor to his Master\u2019s mantle.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Chen Xi opened his mouth, but realized that he had just too many questions to ask, and for a moment didn\u2019t know which one he should ask first.Ji Yu could not stop himself from guiding. \u201cYour current strength is weak, and your physique is extremely frail. I think there would be no harm if you started cultivating the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts first. When your cultivation in body refinement and qi refinement have both attained the Violet Palace Realm of cultivation, you should be capable of passing the 1st trial of the Heavenpeak when you enter the Manor again, and thus obtain the corresponding rewards. As for other matters, there\u2019s no use in thinking too much about them.\u201dChen Xi said in panic, \u201cBut, I still don\u2019t know where the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts are. How do I cultivate?\u201dJi Yu made nothing of it, \u201cI\u2019ll naturally pass it down to you when you leave. Do you have any other questions? If there are none, then I\u2019ll pass down the technique to you and send you on your way.\u201d\u201cSenior, wait.\u201d Chen Xi hurriedly said, \u201cYou said earlier that I\u2019d obtain a corresponding reward when I pass the 1st level of the Heavenspeak of Trials. Is that anything for me to pay attention to?\u201dJi Yu shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m only the spirit of the Manor, how would I know all this? However I do know that when you\u2019ve passed the 1st level of the trials, a mere day would have passed in the outside world for every 3 days you cultivate within the Manor, thus it\u2019s extremely beneficial to your cultivation.\u201dChen Xi let out a deep breath of cold air, and was extremely shocked in his heart,Then more he thought about it, the more excited Chen Xi became, to the extent that he was slightly afraid he wouldn\u2019t be able to bear such a pleasant surprise. He was only at the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm now and had lived within Pine Mist City since he was young. How would he have known that a heaven defying ability to control time existed in the world?\u201cIf you\u2019re able to pass the 2nd trial of Heavenpeak, staying here for 9 days is comparable to 1 day in the outside world. Pass the 3rd level and it would be extended to 81 days, and future trials and rewards would continue to be multiplied in this manner. Eventually when you pass the 18th level, you can cultivate here at will because to the outside world, time would be \u00a0completely frozen.\u201dJi Yu continued as if he was completely oblivious to Chen Xi\u2019s \u00a0state of mind, \u201cBut don\u2019t get happy too early, the 1st level of the Heavenpeak of Trials isn\u2019t that easy to pass. With your current cultivation, entering the trial is no different than courting death. You\u2019d best put your mind on increasing your cultivation. Diligently cultivating is the most important thing you have to do now.\u201dChen Xi quickly calmed down.At this point, Chen Xi completely awoke from his previous inexpressible shock and excitement, noticing that his entire body was drenched in cold sweat. When he raised his head to look at Ji Yu, he instead noted that this Qilin-like spirit was using that pair of eyes that had experienced the vicissitudes in life to stare fixedly at him. It was as if he was able to see through all the thoughts within his heart, causing Chen Xi to be unable to stop himself from feeling a sense of shame.\u201cMy Master once said that only one with a clear and firm heart is capable of comprehending beyond the limits of \u00a0the comprehension of an ordinary person and traversing to the peak of the Grand Dao. Chen Xi, don\u2019t fail to live up to my Master\u2019s expectations.\u201dJi Yu abruptly stepped on the clouds to rise, and howled loudly towards the sky with a voice that was like rolling thunder, rumbling and exploding within the confines of both heaven and earth. The single horn atop his head turned to point at Chen Xi before a 5 colored ray of light swiftly shot out towards Chen Xi and vanished upon entering his body.Chen Xi only felt his vision go black, and in the next moment he\u2019d already appeared within his room.\u201cWhat mother said is really true. Now, not only have I obtained the acknowledgement of the spirit of the Manor and the True Body Brand left behind by the Master of the Manor, I\u2019ve even indirectly managed to acquire a strand of the River Diagram\u2019s True Essence. So long as I remain diligent in my cultivation, I\u2019ll surely be able to become strong!\u201d Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but let out a long breath as he looked at all the familiar things within his room.Pondering for a moment, he once again arrived within his sea of consciousness and couldn\u2019t help but once again sigh in amazement as he gazed upon the Fuxi Divine Statue that emitted a vast and aged aura.After silently gazing at it for a long time, Chen Xi extended his hand to grab a wisp of the 5 colored lights that floated before him. The ball of lights was left within his sea of consciousness by the spirit of the Manor, Ji Yu, before he left. It ought to be the supreme body refinement technique the Master of the Manor left behind, the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts!Whoosh!The moment the tip of his finger touched it, the 5 colored lights instantly transformed into a countless amount of fluttering stars.If one were to look carefully, those stars were impressively composed of ancient character seals that were the size of a palm. The seals were suffused with beautiful and brilliant wavering lights, as if they were a living being filled with vitality. fluttering lightly in the air and brimming with wonderful charm.\u201cCondense!\u201d A melodious voice that was clear and light abruptly sounded. The single word \u00a0revealed a dignified aura of looking down and controlling the entire world, causing one to involuntarily have the intention to submit and worship arise within their heart.Not waiting for Chen Xi to discern the source of the voice, the fluttering and drifting string of beautiful characters abruptly aligned, gathering into an orderly piece of writing. Each character emitted millions upon millions of misty lights!Chen Xi raised his head to look and only felt his mind buzz as the lines of profound characters that were difficult to comprehend were like a gurgling stream as they poured into his mind, unable to be dispersed like a brand.\u201cIt really is the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts. What a peculiar body refinement technique!\u201dAfter Chen Xi quickly ran over it, his heart gave birth to endless shock.Compared to qi refiners, the status of body refiners in Pine Mist City was extremely low. People who chose the path of body refinement were ordinarily all people who were penniless and dejected. They tempered their physiques for the sake of obtaining a job to support their families, such as workers in the quarry and store errand runners; they were no different from laborers.The reason was that body refinement was too arduous and painful, and the conditions for advancement were harsh to the point of being infuriating. Although the path of qi refinement had extremely harsh requirements towards natural talent, as long as one were to cultivate diligently, it was a far easier path to tread. Naturally, the amount of people who took the path of body refinement was significantly reduced.Most importantly, even if one\u2019s natural talent was terrible, so long as one walked on the path of qi refinement, one would be completely capable of obtaining a relaxed and respectable job within Pine Mist City. The qi refiners such as botanists who raised spirit crops and spirit medicine, tamers who raised spirit birds and demon beasts, spirit chefs who cooked delicacies, and apprentices in workshops and retail shops specializing in talisman crafting, weapons refinement, and pill refinement\u2014they were \u00a0all way better off than body refinement laborers, whether it was in treatment, status, or income.Chen Xi had lived in the slums of Pine Mist City since he was young and frequently saw many body refiners who were laborers, thus he was extremely clear of the circumstances they lived in. It was precisely because of this that he\u2019d never once considered the path of body refinement.However, after seeing the profundity of the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts with his own eyes, Chen Xi completely changed his mind.After all, he had learned that the Master of that spirit of the Manor, Senior Fuxi, had attained the realm of being and was capable of establishing his own orthodoxy that would last for generations solely by relying upon his body refinement technique. How would Chen Xi dare look upon body refiners after that?\u201c Chen Xi silent pondered and planned, then abruptly recalled something.Thinking up to here, Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but shake his head.Chen Xi only felt that his entire body had been filled with vigor once he had straightened out his thoughts. Seeing that the sky was glimmering with daybreak, he wasn\u2019t willing to stay in bed any longer. After washing his face in a hurry, Chen Xi was just planning to wake his younger brother up to train in the sword when he noticed the figure of his younger brother had long since disappeared from the room, and he couldn\u2019t help but be startled.Chen Xi walked out of the house and didn\u2019t notice Chen Hao\u2019s figure training his swordsmanship in the courtyard, so Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be even more bewildered in his heart. EverSure enough, right at this moment, Xixi ran all the way into the courtyard, and hurriedly waved her small hand when she noticed Chen Xi. She cried out while panting for breath, \u201cBig Brother Chen Xi, Chen Hao fought with someone, hurry up and go take a look!\u201dChen Xi\u2019s heart tightened and asked, \u201cXixi, where did this happen?\u201dXixi obediently replied, \u201cSkystar Swordsmanship Institution. It\u2019s my mother who asked me to come notify you, my mom already went over.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Chen Xi frowned as a bad premonition arose within his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - Skystar InstitutionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9 - Skystar InstitutionThe eastern area of Pine Mist City had a quiet and well-ordered environment. It occupied a quarter of the city that was also called the Institution District, as innumerable institutions of various sizes stood within the district.The Skystar Swordsmanship Institution was one of them.Among the various institutions, the Skystar Swordsmanship Institution was rather famous, as its ranking was second only to the Pine Mist Institution, and Mountain Mist Institution was ranked third.For parents in Pine Mist City, when they chose an institution for their children, the Pine Mist Institution would naturally be their first chose. However, due to its disciple selection conditions being exceedingly harsh, only a handful of lucky children were able to enter it.The Mountain Mist Institution only recruited female students with superb natural talent, causing most people to stop in their tracks.Only the Skystar Institution wasn\u2019t restricted by any conditions. So long as one paid an extremely high price of spirit stones, one could enter the institution to learn. Thus, among the institutions that were ranked in the top 3, the Skystar Institution would undoubtedly be in the lead in terms of the amount of students.Outside the gates of the Skystar Swordsmanship Institution.Chen Hao\u2019s expression was livid, and he remained silent with a puckered face.Opposite of him stood a youth in fine clothes that was around 13 or 14 years old. His face was beaten black and blue, but his triangular eyes revealed a sense of complacency.\u201cIt\u2019s Chen Hao who was in the wrong this time, and we\u2019ve paid all the medicinal costs. I hope Manager Wu can give him a way out and let him off this once.\u201d At the side, Bai Wanqing was negotiating with a gaunt middle aged man and had an apologetic expression.The gaunt middle aged man leered at Bai Wanqing as he sized her up and only shook his head after a while, \u201cHow is that ok? My Young Master is the youngest son the Patriarch dotes on the most, when has he ever suffered such humiliation? We would rather not have the medical costs, just to make that kid pay a heavy price. Humph! Bullying my Li Clan disciple? How could I let him off so easily?\u201dBai Wanqing forced a smiled and said, \u201cThen what you mean is?\u201dManager Wu rubbed his chin as he said with a grin, \u201cDidn\u2019t I already say it clearly? However, I can let that kid off so long as he admits his fault by kneeling down and kowtowing to my Young Master and hands over 300 spirit stones as compensation. Only then will this matter be forgotten. How about it?\u201dBai Wanqing forcefully endured the rage in her heart as she said in a low voice, \u201cManager Wu, how about this? Let Chen Hao apologize, but can he not kneel?\u201dManager Wu laughed out loud before restraining his smile and saying in disdain, \u201cImpossible!\u201dBai Wanqing was at a loss on what to do and her expression was anxious, without a trace of her refined and calm disposition anymore.\u201cAunt Bai, why are you talking so much nonsense with him? Isn\u2019t it just being expelled? I don\u2019t need to study at this institution anymore!\u201dChen Hao had long since been angered to the point that he clenched his teeth and couldn\u2019t stand aside and watch any longer when he noticed Bai Wanqing was having a hard time and on the brink of tears. He stood out and pointed at the youth in fine clothes, then said in a cold voice, \u201cLi Ming, I\u2019ll still bash you when I see you the next time, you spineless thing! Finding help when your skills are inferior to another, to think that you\u2019re a member of the Li Clan. You\u2019re really thrown your old man\u2019s face! Aunt Bai, let\u2019s go.\u201d Chen Hao pulled Bai Wanqing\u2019s hand and turned around to leave as soon as he finished speaking.Li Ming burst out into a rage as he cried out in a sharp voice, \u201cYou dare insult me? You\u2026you\u2026you\u2026 Manager Wu, what are you standing around for? Didn\u2019t you see him insult me? Bash that bastard for me!\u201dManager Wu had been roared at until malicious flames leapt up within his heart, and he was extremely furious. His body swayed and he was already blocking Chen Hao and Bai Wanqing as he said in a gloomy voice, \u201cThe matter hasn\u2019t been resolved and you two want to leave?\u201dChen Hao was still fearless as before and said in disdain, \u201cI fought Li Ming, so the institution expelled me, and I\u2019ve resigned myself to it. So, according to what was provided by the Dean Yu Ze, the score between me and Li Ming is settled once and for all. So, so long as you dare to injure me and Aunt Bai now, you\u2019ll surely regret it.\u201dManager Wu smiled gloomily, \u201cYou\u2019re just a kid who hasn\u2019t even grown out the hairs on your balls, but you\u2019re spouting such lofty sentiments. The score was settled once and for all? Is that possible? Now I want to know, how will you make me regret it?\u201d As he spoke, he spread out his hand and the imposing manner of his entire body abruptly changed to an appearance that seemed like he would attack if he didn\u2019t agree with a single word Chen Hao said next.\u201cManager Wu, bash him! This kid only knows to be stubborn!\u201d Li Ming yelled out, and his triangular eyes were filled with hatred and excitement.Chen Hao\u2019s expression was extremely calm as before and he said coldly, \u201cIt\u2019s extremely simple. I\u2019ll tell the Skystar Institution that your Li Clan utterly pays no regard to the decision of the Dean Yu Ze. I\u2019ll also head to the General\u2019s Estate and let the Grand General know that your Li Clan challenged the authority of the General\u2019s Estate by starting trouble and initiating a fight within Pine Mist City! Unless you kill me right now, but do you dare?\u201dManager Wu\u2019s expression froze and his complexion was unsettled. What Chen Hao said had indeed stabbed his weak spot, and the only reason he hesitated so long and hadn\u2019t attacked was precisely out of consideration for this.The General\u2019s Estate ruled over the entire Pine Mist City and represented the will of the Darchu Dynasty. It had already ordered the prohibition of cultivators battling within the city. \u00a0Once a violation was discovered, the violator\u2019s cultivation would be crippled before being banished to the mining district to be enslaved. Not to mention a tiny little manager, even the Li Clan patriarch wouldn\u2019t dare take a step beyond the prohibition.Although the Skystar Institutions strength wasn\u2019t comparable to the Li Clan, Dean Yu Ze was a 6th star Violet Palace Realm expert whose battle strength was ranked 3rd within Pine Mist City.Manage Wu\u2019s struggled incomparably within his heart.Bai Wanqing was extremely amazed as she looked at Chen Hao\u2019s calm and immature small face, truly unable to imagine how he was actually able to deliver his sonorous and forceful speech with such a clear arrangement.\u201cManager Wu, he\u2019s from an impoverished family that lives in the commoner district and his brother is a famous jinx. Even if we bash him, out of consideration for our Li Clan, the General\u2019s Estate and the Skystar Institution would surely choose to stand by idly. What are you hesitating for?\u201dLi Ming couldn\u2019t help himself from crying out anxiously when he saw Manager Wu hesitating and indeterminate, \u201cEven if something were to happen; don\u2019t you still have me?\u201dManager Wu finally made a decision, and coldly said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Young Master, if I don\u2019t break the legs of that kid, I\u2019ll be ashamed towards the care and upbringing the Patriarch provided me!\u201dManager Wu brazenly attacked right after he finished speaking. True Essence flowed out from his hand to form a pair of sharp talons that fiercely clawed at Chen Hao.Chen Hao had long since noticed it wasn\u2019t going well. When Manager Wu had just finished speaking, he pushed Bai Wanqing away and dodged swiftly at the same time, barely avoiding the sharp talons that came at him.A strong gust of wind swept at his face, scraping it Chen Hao\u2019s face to the point of pain, and he couldn\u2019t help but be astonished in his heart.\u201cHumph! Let me see how long you can dodge!\u201d Seeing Chen Hao dodging his claw attack caused Manager Wu to be slightly started, following which he snorted coldly and the True Essence within his entire body surged. A pitch-black sheen appeared on his pair of palms that were skinny like bamboo, and a shocking aura swept out.Swoosh!Manager Wu\u2019s figure swayed to appear before Chen Hao like a ghost, his palms like butterflies flitting through the flowers as they transformed into palm images that covered the sky, instantly sealing all Chen Hao\u2019s paths of escape.Chen Hao was forced into a corner, and instead took a step forward, entirely disregarding the palm images that covered the sky. His right fist was wrapped up in the True Essence that madly poured out from his body and fiercely smashed his fist towards Manager Wu, with an appearance that showed he would put his life on the line to injure Manager Wu.This was also an action Chen Hao had no choice but to take, as even though he\u2019d broken through to the Congenital Realm, but is foundation was still shallow and was far from being Manager Wu\u2019s match. Only by putting his life on the line would he perhaps be able to retrieve a trace of a chance at survival.As expected, Manager Wu was completely unwilling to suffer an injury alongside Chen Hao and quickly retreated two steps. He then changed his palm into a fist, and fiercely knocked it into Chen Hao\u2019s approaching fist.Bang!The colliding fists emitted a bang that was oppressive like thunder, and the dissipating True Essence blew out currents of air that wrecked the surroundings, causing dust and dirt to swirl in the air.Chen Hao stomped hard on the ground as he continuously retreated 10 steps before spitting out a large mouthful of blood. His small face instantly became white as a sheet as he\u2019d \u00a0suffered internal injuries.\u201cLittle Hao!\u201d Bai Wanqing couldn\u2019t help but exclaim lightly. She wasn\u2019t skilled in battle and was utterly unable to help. For a moment her heart was torn with anxiety and she was at a loss of what to do.After forcefully colliding fists with Chen Hao, Manager Wu didn\u2019t move an inch and was wasn\u2019t injured in the slightest. He gazed at Chen Hao in disdain as he coldly said, \u201cOnly at the 1st level of the Congenital Realm and you dare fight me? Let me cripple your legs obediently!\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, his body swayed before once again appearing beside Chen Hao. His right leg flew out like a ridged rod[1. \u94a2\u97ad, it\u2019s an ancient weapon that\u2019s like a rod with a sword handle and ridges. Use the raw text to google search if you\u2019re curious. ] that brought with it a swift and fierce gust of wind that fiercely swept towards Chen Hao\u2019s legs!Right at the moment when Manager Wu\u2019s right legs was about to hit Chen Hao, a terrifying sense of danger abruptly arose within his heart. He fiercely stomped the tips of his toes onto the ground without the slightest bit of hesitation and his body swiftly retreated backwards.Bang!At the exact instant that Manager Wu retreated, an icicle that was sharp as a sword appeared out of thin air to barely scrape past Manager Wu\u2019s scalp as it pierced downwards, going straight through the limestone floor, leaving behind a hole the size of a bowl.Manager Wu touched his scalp that faintly ached and couldn\u2019t help but gasp. Were it not for him dodging swiftly, wouldn\u2019t this icicle have taken his life?It wasn\u2019t only Manager Wu, the other people present were stunned by the sudden scene as well, and entirely didn\u2019t notice the trace of a black shadow silently appearing at the side of the battlefield.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d An extremely familiar voice abruptly sounded beside Chen Hao\u2019s ears, and before he could even react to the voice he was already carried in the arms of another, swiftly flashing out into the distance.\u201cBrother!\u201d Chen Hao was extremely happy, following which he realized something and cried out, \u201cWait! Aunt Bai is still there!\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m here.\u201d A gentle voice that was pleasing to the ear sounded. Chen Hao looked up to notice Bai Wanqing lay prone on his older brother\u2019s back, and her refined face revealed a slightly embarrassed expression.\u2026\u201cTrash! They were actually saved by someone from under your eyes! Manager Wu, what\u2019s the use of my father sending you?\u201dWhen Li Ming reacted, Chen Hao and Bai Wanqing\u2019s figures had vanished long ago. He was angered to the point he vented a belly full of rage at Manager Wu, unceasingly roaring in rage.Manager Wu turned a deaf ear to Li Ming as he silently squatted down to look at the hole in the floor that the icicle pierced through and muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s actually a first-grade Icicle Talisman. This person\u2019s strength definitely doesn\u2019t exceed the Congenital Realm. But this person is really adept at seizing an opportunity. Not only was the timing of his attack precise and ruthless, moreover he was able take advantage of the moment we were panic-stricken to carry them out and flee. This level of calculation and judgement can be considered top-notch. This fellow couldn\u2019t be that jinx, right?\u201dLi Ming got even more furious when he noticed Manager Wu paying absolutely no attention to him and fiercely said, \u201cOkay! You, Manager Wu are really capable! I\u2019ll go tell my father right now that not only did you release the enemy without permission, but you even intentionally embarrassed me. If I don\u2019t drive you out of the Li Clan, then this Young Master will change his surname to Wu!\u201dManager Wu stood up unhurriedly and said with an expressionless face, \u201cYoung Master, if you really do that, then I\u2019ll have no choice but to clearly give an account of all the evil deeds you\u2019ve committed all these years.\u201dLi Ming was stunned and had an unsettled expression. \u201cManager Wu, you\u2026you\u2026 What nonsense are you speaking!?\u201d His imposing manner weakened.Manger Wu patted his hands before saying indifferently, \u201cYoung Master, let\u2019s go. Be sure to not act impulsively in the future, or else it\u2019ll be difficult to say if some unpleasant remarks would enter the Patriarch\u2019s ears. As for that Chen Hao, we\u2019ll slowly deal with him in the future. What do you think?\u201dLi Ming nodded in a daze, seeming to be preoccupied.Manager Wu laughed disdainfully in his heart. \u201cA cold and arrogant figure involuntarily appeared within Manager Wu\u2019s mind when he recalled Li Ming\u2019s older brother. A cold feeling arose within his heart without reason, causing him to abruptly shudder as a cold shiver ran down his spine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - Combat TacticsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10 - Combat TacticsChen Xi heaved a sigh of relief upon arriving home.During the battle earlier, although it was only for an instant, it \u00a0consumed an extreme amount of his mental strength.Combat was his weakness; since learning to craft talismans 5 years ago, he\u2019d become too busy to have time to cultivate combat techniques. However he was extremely clear about his strong points: being skilled at talisman crafting and knowing the might of the various basic talismans like the palm of his hand.Nevertheless, this was his first time in combat, after all. He had no choice but to carefully ponder and deliberate repetitively to ensure that every step from the entry point into the battle to the route of escape would be free of errors before resolutely making a move.Luckily, everything went as he expected and no mishaps occurred. This also allowed him to deeply understand that a precise set of combat tactics would sometimes play a part of vital importance during an operation.Bai Wanqing\u2019s beautiful eyebrows slightly frowned as she asked anxiously. \u201cChen Xi, we\u2019ve returned, but what if they pursue us here?\u201d\u201cI made a trip to the General\u2019s Estate before I went to save you two.\u201d Chen Xi answered calmly.Bai Wanqing said in disappointment, \u201cDidn\u2019t they say that in consideration of the Li Clan, the General\u2019s Estate wouldn\u2019t interfere in this matter?\u201dChen Hao, who stood beside her, instead realized what had happened and said with a smile, \u201cAunt Bai, if I took a thrashing earlier, then even if the General\u2019s Estate found out afterwards, out of consideration towards the Li Clan, they would naturally act as if they didn\u2019t know. However, now that this matter has been exposed by my big brother, the General\u2019s Estate can\u2019t continue their act. Because if we were to be victimized, even if the General\u2019s Estate is unwilling to stand up for us, for the sake of upholding their reputation in the heart of the Pine Mist City commoners, they have no choice but to interfere in this matter. In this way, wouldn\u2019t the Li Clan have to pay the proper price?\u201d\u201cAfter all, the General\u2019s Estate represents the will of the Darchu Dynasty. It would absolutely not tolerate someone openly defying its authority! So, if the Li Clan is intelligent, they would absolutely not dare make a move against us at this time.\u201dBai Wanqing was startled and finally understood. As she looked at the two brothers before her, her heart was filled with incomparable wonder for some time.Bai Wanqing couldn\u2019t help but feel a burst of sadness as she thought up to this point.\u201cHow\u2019re your injuries?\u201d Chen Xi suddenly asked.\u201cI\u2019ll be fine after a few days of recuperation.\u201d Chen Hao laughed as he asked, \u201cBrother, that old dog Wu\u2019s strength ought to be at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm, how did you accomplish that earlier?\u201dChen Xi casually replied, \u201cIt was nothing more than taking him by surprise. If it was fighting him head on, even you and I together wouldn\u2019t be his match.\u201dChen Hao pursued, \u201cTaking him by surprise? I undoubtedly didn\u2019t see you earlier, how did you suddenly appear? What formidable cultivation technique is this?\u201dBai Wanqing\u2019s curiosity was evoked as well, as during the battle earlier, she similarly didn\u2019t see Chen Xi, and only felt her body go light before being carried on Chen Xi\u2019s back.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely simple.\u201d Chen Xi pondered for a moment before answering. \u201cWhen you two were in combat earlier, I used a Stealth Talisman and an Aura Restraining Talisman. As for the surprise attack on Manager Wu, I used an Icicle Talisman.\u201dChen Hao said in astonishment, \u201cAll these are first-grade basic talismans.\u201dChen Xi nodded as he said, \u201cThe point isn\u2019t the talismans, it\u2019s the ability to grasp the rhythm of the battle.\u201dBai Wanqing was clearly confused, but Chen Hao instead came to a sudden understanding as he said with a laugh, \u201cRight, old dog Wu\u2019s first mistake was underestimating the enemy. His second mistake was neglecting the surrounding environment. His third mistake was losing control of his state of mind. Utilizing these mistakes, you\u2019re indeed able to do many things. However, the precondition is you must have already calculated the occurrence of these mistakes before making your move, only then would you be able to accomplish your goal.\u201dAs he spoke up to this point, Chen Hao raised his head and said with a face full of admiration, \u201cBrother, were all these within your predictions?\u201dChen Xi avoided replying and said, \u201cTactics are only minor Dao\u2019s, and can only be used once and not twice. If that Manager Wu possessed a cultivation at the Violet Palace Realm, any schemes would be ineffective.\u201dChen Hao said with a smile, \u201cOf course, all schemes and tricks will completely crumble before absolute strength. Just like that Stealth Talisman and Aura Restraining Talisman. They\u2019d be completely useless before the formidable perception of a Violet Palace Realm cultivator.\u201dAfter advancement into the Violet Palace Realm, a trace of one\u2019s Soul Sense would leave the sea of consciousness and allow one to attain the power of perception, which enables one to easily discern the fluctuations in the surrounding airflow. Thus the Stealth Talisman and Aura Restraining Talisman were indeed unable to avoid a Violet Palace Realm cultivator\u2019s power of perception.\u201cRight, how\u2019d you get into a fight with a member of the Li Clan?\u201d Chen Xi asked. He originally didn\u2019t plan on finding out the exact details, but since the matter was related to the Li Clan, it instead made him exceedingly vigilant. Among the enemies that killed his grandfather, the Li Clan was the target most worthy of suspect.Chen Hao lowered his head and kept silent.Bai Wanqing hurriedly explained, and only then did Chen Xi find out the sequence of events.It turned out to be that Chen Hao planned to return to the Skystar Institute to train his swordsmanship this morning, but he\u2019d only just entered the institute when he was sarcastically ridiculed by Li Ming. Li Ming said that after Chen Xi caused his grandfather\u2019s death, the next would be he, Chen Hao. The words Li Ming spoke were extremely malicious and despicable, completely enraging Chen Hao to the extent that he was willing to violate the institute\u2019s rules and bash Li Ming before the eyes of all the students and teachers.The Dean Yu Ze was furious and issued the punishment of being expelled to Chen Hao. However, Yu Ze also indicated that so long as Li Ming forgave Chen Hao\u2019s offense, Chen Hao could still continue to train within the institute. Li Ming was naturally unwilling, so he summoned Manager Wu over, and the following events were naturally something that needn\u2019t be mentioned.Chen Xi gave it a thought, then frowned as he said, \u201cIn that case, you\u2019ve already been completely expelled?\u201dChen Hao held up his immature small face, and the corners of his mouth lightly puckered, but he was still stubborn as he said in a loud voice, \u201cBrother, I don\u2019t regret it.\u201dChen Xi wanted to get angry, but didn\u2019t have the heart to. He knew that every time his younger brother fought, it was practically always for the sake of defending him. His younger brother being unable to stand another insult him was just like him being unable to stand another bullying his younger brother.\u201cLittle Hao is only 12 this year and has already advanced into the Congenital Realm. I feel that he can give the Pine Mist Institution a try.\u201d The nearby Bai Wanqing suggested.Chen Xi was started, and shook his head, \u201cThe Pine Mist Institute\u2019s recruitment conditions are extremely harsh, and with Little Hao\u2019s right hand\u2019s crippled, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201dBai Wanqing interrupted, \u201cHow do you know if you don\u2019t try? If Little Hao is willing, I can help recommend him to an instructor from the Pine Mist Institution.\u201dChen Hao said without hesitation, \u201cOf course I\u2019m willing. Aunt Bai, you\u2019re really able to help me?\u201dBai Wanqing let out a laugh, \u201cI can only help recommend you, you\u2019ll have to rely on yourself to fight for the rest.\u201dChen Xi couldn\u2019t help but size up Bai Wanqing once more when he heard what she said.According to his knowledge, Bai Wanqing was only a kitchen assistant within a restaurant in the city, and was barely able to maintain the livelihood of herself and Xixi by relying upon this job. Her living conditions weren\u2019t any better than him and his younger brother; how would she know an instructor within the Pine Mist Institution?\u201cThen let\u2019s go now.\u201d Chen Xi made his decision.The Pine Mist Institution\u2019s foundation was solid and possessed a strength that was completely capable of keeping up with the General\u2019s Estate and the Li Clan. If his younger brother was able to enter the Pine Mist Institution to train, his younger brother completely wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the Li Clan\u2019s revenge anymore, and he wouldn\u2019t have to worry so much.\u2026Pine Mist Institution, Sword-Polishing Hall.Each and every azure-clad youth had upright postures and were in high spirits.Their expression were serious as they gazed upon the tall figure ahead with gazes that revealed unending adoration.This person was tall and gaunt, with brows that were distant from each other and a sturdy figure. He seemed like an unshakeable towering lone mountain as he stood there, and his entire body emitted a deep and concentrated dignified aura.He was Meng Kong, the Sword-Polishing Hall\u2019s instructor, a 6th star Violet Palace Realm sword cultivator!\u201cRegardless of palm techniques, fist techniques, footwork, or perhaps sword technique, sabre technique, spear technique \u2014 they\u2019re all divided into the basic-stage, advanced-stage, and unity-stage.\u201cWhen the sword technique is successfully cultivated, it\u2019s considered to be at the basic-stage. When the sword technique is successfully cultivated to mastery, it\u2019s considered to be at the advanced-stage. And when the sword technique is successfully cultivated to perfection, it can be called the unity-stage. Arriving at this step, the spirit energy of heaven and earth will be drawn for your use when the sword technique is executed, causing your offensive power to rise rapidly and multiply. However, this can merely be called as starting to pry into the Dao of the sword, and is taking the first step on the path to seeking the Dao through use of the sword!\u201d\u201cSo, when you haven\u2019t attained the unity-stage, all of you aren\u2019t considered true sword cultivators, and don\u2019t have anything worthy of being arrogant about! Do all of you understand?\u201dMeng Kong\u2019s voice was cold and stern like ice, as it vibrated within the entire Sword-Polishing Hall, unceasing for a long time.The mass of azure-clad youth\u2019s hearts shook when they heard what he said, then they stuck out their chests with firm gazes and said in unison, \u201cUnderstood!\u201dMeng Kong nodded and didn\u2019t say anything more.\u201cInstructor Meng, someone is looking for you outside.\u201d An institute guard jogged over and said in a low voice.Meng Kong frowned, \u201cDidn\u2019t you see that I\u2019m in a class?\u201dThe institution guard\u2019s heart shook and he swallowed a mouthful of saliva with difficulty as he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cThat women said that you\u2019d definitely see her. However, if you aren\u2019t free, then I\u2019ll go refuse her request right away.\u201dMeng Kong was startled, and a refined and mature woman\u2019s figure appeared in his mind. A trace of excitement arose within his heart for no reason and he took a deep breath to forcefully calm himself down, then said in a low voice, \u201cHold on, what\u2019s her name?\u201dThe institution guard scratched his head and said hesitatingly, \u201cShe\u2019s surnamed Bai, and seems to be called\u2026called Wanqing. I\u2019m not so sure, should I go ask again?\u201dThe institution guard raised his head, but noticed to his astonishment that Meng Kong had long since disappeared, and it was unknown where he\u2019d went.\u2026Meng Kong\u2019s eyes were wide open as he looked at the familiar figure before him in disbelief. His firm and cold face was already covered in excitement.\u201cWanqing, you\u2019re finally willing to see me.\u201d His spoke with a trembling voice that was hoarse and deep.Bai Wanqing\u2019s expression was extremely complicated when she saw Meng Kong, and she took a deep breath until her feelings steadied, then she turned her head to say to the nearby Chen Xi, \u201cYou and Little Hao wait outside first, I have something to talk with Meng\u2026the instructor alone.\u201dChen Xi nodded, then pulled Chen Hao to turn around and go out.He\u2019d already discerned that Bai Wanqing had an out of the ordinary relationship with this man called Meng Kong, and the two of them ought to have not met for many years, or else the scene from before would be an unlikely occurrence.He couldn\u2019t help but be curious in his heart; what was the relationship between Aunt Bai and this man called Meng Kong after all?\u201cBrother, do you think I can succeed?\u201d Chen Hao raised his small face and asked. He was young after all, and was unable to make out the emotional association between men and women.Chen Xi pondered for a moment and then said, \u201cThere ought to be no problem.\u201d Through the scene from earlier, he was roughly able to be certain that his younger brother might really be able to enter the Pine Mist Institution, with Aunt Bai as the most vital link in the chain.Before long, the door opened once again.Bai Wanqing\u2019s eyes were red and swollen, but it was difficult to conceal her relief. She seemed to have opened a lock at the bottom of her heart and called out with a smile, \u201cCome in both of you, Instructor Meng wants to test Little Hao\u2019s swordsmanship.\u201dChen Hao\u2019s spirit rose, and he rubbed his fists together, \u201cAlright!\u201dA trace of a light smile that wasn\u2019t easy to notice silently slipped over the corners of Chen Xi\u2019s lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - Clear Stream RestaurantPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11 - Clear Stream RestaurantSwish! Swish!Sword light flowed out like a stream, and the fierce and sharp sword qi flew out in a spray that spattered towards the surroundings, emitting strands of sharp whistling sounds as it rent the air.Chen Hao held a sword in his left hand, his small face filled with a steadfast expression and a gaze as calm as still water. His thin and small figure was enclosed within dense sword silhouettes; the Minor Skystar Sword Technique that he\u2019d learnt from the Skystar Institution was executed by him with precise and skilful moves that fluttered about agilely. His movements were smooth and natural as he dripped with sweat and executed the technique to his heart\u2019s content.Chen Xi\u2019s expression was in an endless trance as he looked at his younger brother, as if he\u2019d returned to 5 years ago.At that time, he too was steadfast and persistent like this, infatuated with the cultivation of his swordsmanship, as every move of the sword technique was repeatedly trained by him millions upon millions of times without the slightest feeling of disinterest or exhaustion.Every time this moment occurred, his grandfather would stand at the side without saying a word and only looked at him with a smile, his wrinkled face filled with gratification.Chen Xi\u2019s mood was complicated and difficult to put into words as he gazed at this younger brother\u2019s figure that practiced his swordsmanship under the sunlight.\u201cGood! Your sword technique has already reached the advanced-stage. What\u2019s rare is because he\u2019s wielding the sword with the left hand, the sword moves have a trace of both unpredictability and diversity. With a little bit of tempering, he\u2019d definitely become an outstanding talent!\u201dMeng Kong clapped as he praised highly, and a rare trace of admiration was revealed on his firm expression.If one were to say that Meng Kong only decided to test Chen Hao out of fear of hurting Bai Wanqing\u2019s feelings, then now his heart was in admiration of the thin and weak youth who wielded a sword in his left hand.He saw the staunchness and persistence towards the sword in Chen Hao, the most basic quality to become a qualified sword cultivator. Especially since Chen Hao was only 12 now, and yet he was still able to attain the advanced-stage in his sword technique. With time, such extraordinary talent was bound to journey further on the path of the Dao of the sword!Bai Wanqing secretly heaved a sigh of relief. As she gazed at Chen Hao, she felt a sense of honour because of him. She knew how harsh Meng Kong\u2019s conditions were for disciple selections, and being able to receive generous praise from him was enough for Chen Hao to be proud of!\u2026Chen Xi kept silent as they walked out of the Pine Mist Institution.He was naturally extremely happy that his younger brother had become the disciple of Instructor Meng Kong and a member of the Pine Mist Institution as expected. However, he felt a slight headache when he thought of how the Pine Mist Institutions yearly tuition fee was 4,000 spirit stones.Even if he were to not eat nor drink, he would probably be unable to pay the tuition by merely relying upon talisman crafting.\u201cYou should be happy. The Pine Mist Institution isn\u2019t a place anyone can enter, and there might not even be 1 in 1,000 that are able to become the disciple of Instructor Meng. Chen Hao will be able to tap into even more latent potential when training his swordsmanship with Instructor Meng, and it\u2019s extremely beneficial for his future path as a sword cultivator.\u201dBai Wanqing seemed to have discerned Chen Xi\u2019s thoughts and laughed, \u201cAs for spirit stones, you don\u2019t have to worry. I\u2019ll lend you some first, just return it to me later on.\u201dChen Xi shook his head, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. Senior Meng agreeing to allow me to repay the tuition fees at the end of the year has already been a great help to me. I plan to find another job, and strive to gather the 4,000 by the end of the year.\u201dBai Wanqing let out a laugh and didn\u2019t force him, then said, \u201cBesides talisman crafting, what else do you plan to do?\u201dChen Xi pondered before saying, \u201cNaturally the more money it earns, the better.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Bai Wanqing said. She pondered for some time, then her eyes abruptly lit up, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to Clear Stream Restaurant? Aren\u2019t you skilled in talisman crafting? The controlling of spirit flames ought to be easy for you to learn. I know a spirit chef that still doesn\u2019t have a disciple until today, why don\u2019t you go give it a try? Once you become a spirit chef apprentice, earning 30 spirit stones a day wouldn\u2019t be difficult. If you\u2019re able to undertake cooking alone, you\u2019d be completely able to earn even more spirit stones.\u201dChen Xi said hesitatingly, \u201cChef?\u201dBai Wanqing had a smile on her face as she stared angrily and said, \u201cDon\u2019t look down on spirit chefs. The dishes that every spirit chef cooks are not only superb in flavour, but also possess various wonderful effects. For example, stabilizing the Dao foundation, strengthening True Essence, healing injuries\u2026 Every one of those wealthy clans possess their own exclusive spirit chef to serve them, with a status that is no different in the slightest to a talisman master.\u201dChen Xi was startled, \u201cThen, aren\u2019t spirit chefs extremely similar to alchemists?\u201dBai Wanqing let out a laugh, \u201cExactly, both require being able to understand the properties of various medicinal materials by heart, and both require spirit flames to control the process. But they both still have differences. the spirit chef attaches importance to the taste and its effects are only supplementary; the alchemist attaches importance to effects, but instead never considers taste. If one were to judge which is superior, then it would depend on their standards.\u201dChen Xi came to a sudden understanding and thought for a moment, then finally made a decision, \u201cThen I\u2019ll go give it a try.\u201dBai Wanqing smiled happily as she said, \u201cYou\u2019ll definitely be fine. Wielding a brush to craft talismans requires wrist strength, wielding the ladle and cutting up ingredients requires wrist strength as well; the combination of ink requires balancing various materials according to proportions and the cooking of dishes is similarly so. The only thing you have to pay attention to is the control of spirit flames, but you draw talismans throughout the year and are skilled in precise control. Thus, controlling the spirit flames wouldn\u2019t be too difficult for you.\u201dChen Xi however never expected that Bai Wanqing would look so favourably upon him, and couldn\u2019t help but feel embarrassed. How was he skilled at crafting talismans when he\u2019d only mastered various first-grade basic talismans now?\u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019ll take you over right now,\u201d Bai Wanqing said excitedly.\u201cUh, now?\u201d Chen Xi felt extremely conflicted, as he still hadn\u2019t thanked Bai Wanqing for the matter of his younger brother entering Pine Mist Institution earlier and now he had to trouble her again. Even if his face was even thicker, he would still find it slightly embarrassing.Bai Wanqing was stupefied momentarily, and looked in amazement at the embarrassed and uncomfortable youth before her. This was still the first time she\u2019d seen such a rich change in Chen Xi\u2019s expression, and he completely lacked the sedate and stiff aura from before.She couldn\u2019t help but sigh emotionally in her heart,\u2026The Clear Stream Restaurant was built at the riverside, and its construction was refined and exquisite with superb style. Three 3 leaf spirit chefs personally attended to the cooking, and it possessed the reputation of being the number 1 restaurant within Pine Mist City.Bai Wanqing was a kitchen assistant within the Clear Stream Restaurant that specialized in purchasing ingredients.The rear kitchen of the Clear Stream Restaurant was situated at the back of the restaurant, and row after row of bright and clean stoves were spread out in a range of around 330m. Freshly purchased pieces of spirit birds and demon beast\u2019s meat, produce and grains that emitted traces of spirit energy, bottles and containers that contained exotic seasonings\u2026 \u00a0Various materials related to delicacies filled the entire kitchen in orderly placements.Apprentices were busy at every corner, some were using spirit flames to cure and smoke meat, some used knives to peel and cut produce and some were combining seasonings. Before the stoves were strands of spirit flames in various colors that continuously gushed out, and youth spirit chef apprentices wielded their ladles and lifted their woks as they cooked semi-finished dishes one after the other.Chen Xi, who followed behind Bai Wanqing, couldn\u2019t help but be shocked in his heart the moment he walked into the rear kitchen and saw such a magnificent scene. It was the first time he\u2019d seen a kitchen of such scale.\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019re going to the 2nd floor.\u201d Without wasting any time here, Bai Wanqing brought Chen Xi along the nearby staircase to walk up the 2nd floor.\u201cThe 1st floor is where the various ingredients are prepared and the 2nd floor is where the three spirit chefs cook delicacies.\u201d Bai Wanqing explained as they walked, \u201cThe spirit chef I spoke of is surnamed Ma, and everyone calls him old man Ma. His character is slightly strange, but he\u2019s a very kind person. You better nicely show off your skills when you see him later.\u201dChen Xi silently nodded.\u201cLittle Bai? Why\u2019re you talking behind my back, little girl? Be careful or I might ask the boss to fire you.\u201d A hoarse voice that was unpleasant to hear sounded from within the room in 2nd floor, seeming to be enraged and yet revealing a joking tone.Chen Xi shot a glance at the nearby Bai Wanqing, as a weird feeling emerged in his heart. Aunt Bai\u2019s daughter was already 6, but this old man Ma instead called her Little Bai; he was practically an old man who didn\u2019t know how to conduct himself.Bai Wanqing noticed Chen Xi\u2019s gaze and secretly was extremely embarrassed and angry. If she\u2019d known that this would happen earlier, she wouldn\u2019t have brought Chen Xi here. But when she thought about how old man Ma was a person who said everything on his mind, she dropped it.She led Chen Xi to push the door and enter, and what entered their eyes was actually a scene that was like a paradise away from the world.The blue sky was like silk, with white clouds like cotton and a path that twisted and turned between the surrounding flowers, trees, and thick grass. At the end of the path stood an impressive jade-green bamboo pavilion that was concealed within cedar trees and green pine trees.Chen Xi\u2019s gaze lingered for a moment, practically instantly discerning that everything before him were illusions formed by a formation.Infinite wonder couldn\u2019t help but be aroused within Chen Xi\u2019s heart as he breathed the delicate fragrance of flowers and trees in the air. Only one that was above a ninth-grade talisman master could be called a talisman formation master. Currently, he was only a first-grade talisman master, and he couldn\u2019t help but wonder when he\u2019d be able to attain such heights.\u201cThis is a Jadesky Flower Formation, a low-grade illusion formation, and it contains life-threatening dangers hidden within. Carefully follow behind me, don\u2019t move about arbitrarily.\u201d Bai Wanqing instructed in a low voice before walking forward on the winding path.Chen Xi\u2019s heart jumped and he followed behind Bai Wanqing step by step, not daring to be careless in the slightest.Talisman masters and the talismans they crafted were divided into 9 grades. Above the ninth-grade talisman master was the talisman formation master, and the talisman formations crafted by them were divided into the low-grade, intermediate-grade, and high-grade.According to Chen Xi\u2019s knowledge, a graded illusion formation was sufficient to cause a Violet Palace Realm cultivator to not dare go one step beyond its boundaries. The Jadesky Flower Formation before him undoubtedly possessed such a formidable lethality. How would he dare act rashly?The scene changed once again when he stepped into the jade-green bamboo pavilion. The entire room was extremely simple, and only three stoves were placed within. There was nothing else present within, and it was completely incomparable to a strand of that beautiful kitchen from earlier.At this moment, an old man, a man, and a woman stood before the three stoves as they cooked with skilled movements. Behind the three, an almost lifelike puppet quietly stood there holding a round tray in its hand, and placed on top of the tray were a great variety of various ingredients.Along with a resonant whistle, the man that stood behind a stove raised his head and greeted Bai Wanqing while smiling broadly, \u201cHi, pretty lady Bai.\u201dThis tall and handsome man was dressed like a gentleman and had a pair of sword shaped eyebrows and starry eyes, the corners of his mouth lightly curled up and a trace of a charming smile hung there.\u201cWhat a young and handsome youth! This big sister is drooling at the sight of him. Mmm, little sister Wanqing, is this your lover?\u201d Behind the other stove, the enchanting woman clad in a fiery red dress raised her head. Her hot and graceful figure had a pair of soft breasts that stood tall and erect, and her watery eyes were shaped like a petal of a peach blossom while staring straight at Chen Xi as her charming and beautiful face revealed an attractive smile.Before the last stove, an old man who was skinny like a monkey glared as he struck the ladle in his hand and shouted loudly, \u201cGet back to work!\u201dThe entire body of the handsome man and enchanting woman trembled as their bodies swished in unison to devote themselves to cooking, looking like they were extremely obedient\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 - Spirit ChefPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12 - Spirit Chef\u201cOh, that\u2019s Qiao Nan, and that\u2019s Pei Pei.\u201dBai Wanqing extended her hand to point at the man and woman, then turned to face the skinny old man, and introduced to Chen Xi in a low voice, \u201cThis is old man Ma, the senior brother of Qiao Nan and Pei Pei. The three of them are all 3 leaf spirit chefs.\u201dChen Xi nodded and bowed. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, seniors.\u201dSlosh! Slosh!No one paid any attention to Chen Xi, and only the sound of cooking delicacies within the woks echoed out continuously.Since he was born, Chen Xi had experienced countless occasions similar to this, and he\u2019d long since tempered his disposition to be exceedingly tenacious. Thus he didn\u2019t feel embarrassed.Bai Wanqing, however, couldn\u2019t take it. She directly walked over to old man Ma and suddenly snatched away the iron ladle in his hand as she said fiercely, \u201cOld man Ma, can\u2019t you see I\u2019ve come to recommend a disciple to you?\u201dOld man Ma fiercely glared and was about to flare up when he noticed Bai Wanqing glaring back at him without letting up in the slightest. He knew he couldn\u2019t do anything against this girl and could only say in grief, \u201cLittle Bai, stop causing trouble. This is a plate of high-quality sliced chili spirit roe-deer meat!\u201dAs he spoke, his palms that were skinny like bamboo held up the iron wok, then tilted the wok to pour the entire dish that revealed a bright lustre of fresh chili onto the plate. The broth was oil-red with meat cubes matched with seasoning of various colors that were delicate like silk. An exquisite fragrance suffused the air from this dish that was both pleasant to the eye and smelt good.\u201cOld man Ma, open your eyes wide and look! Chen Xi\u2019s skilled in crafting talismans, and possesses both nimble control of his wrist strength and acute perception. He\u2019s at the Congenital Realm as well. Could it be that even such natural talent isn\u2019t worthy of being your disciple?\u201dBai Wanqing had long since lost her modest and calm demeanour, she pursed her cherry lips as she said savage and unreasonably, \u201cI don\u2019t care, you must accept Chen Xi today!\u201dOld man Ma was startled and seemed to have recalled something as he let out a peculiar laugh. \u201cChen Xi? It couldn\u2019t be that jinx right?\u201dQiao Nan and Pe Pei who were busy before the stoves stopped all their movements upon hearing this and gazed at Chen Xi with strange expressions.Bai Wanqing\u2019s body trembled, as she was extremely furious. She truly wished for nothing more than to strangle this damned old man to death for touching such a tender spot.Her heart was extremely perturbed as she looked over at Chen Xi. But what she noticed was Chen Xi lightly pucker his lips and said calmly, \u201cIt isn\u2019t important whether I\u2019m a jinx or not; what\u2019s important is I never expected that Senior Ma turned out to be so conventional. Aunt Bai, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Bai Wanqing said, feeling slightly ashamed for bringing Chen Xi here.\u201cWait.\u201d The two of them were just planning to leave when old man Ma yelled in rage. \u201cWho the fuck is conventional? Who cares if he\u2019s villainous without any redeeming features, or greatly merciful and compassionate? As far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s all fucking rubbish!\u201dThe more he spoke, the louder his voice became until he was practically roaring. \u201cWhat I\u2019m accepting is a disciple, so long as he can inherit all my culinary arts, who\u2019s so free to care about all that?\u201dBai Wanqing said in pleasant surprise, \u201cThen you plan to accept Chen Xi as your disciple?\u201dOld man Ma\u2019s face froze, hesitant and indeterminate.Qiao Nan secretly winked at Bai Wanqing and spoke with a serious expression. \u201cSenior brother, accept him. I believe in a person that pretty Lady Bai looks favourably upon!\u201dPei Pei\u2019s gaze lingered on Chen Xi for a moment as she covertly shot Chen Xi a seductive glance. Only then did she plead to old man Ma with a pitiable expression. \u201cYeah, senior brother. Chen Xi looks young and steady, and he\u2019s skilled in crafting talismans. Accept him.\u201dChen Xi was startled and kept his silence, but a trace of hope arose within his heart.He\u2019d refused earlier because old man Ma mocked him to his face. If he were to humble himself and plead the old man, then even if he\u2019d successfully taken old man Ma as his master; if he still had to constantly suffer old man Ma\u2019s mocking, then he would rather not have this opportunity.Moreover, after hearing old man Ma\u2019s roars, he\u2019d understood that old man Ma wasn\u2019t as terrible as he\u2019d thought, and that little bit of anger in his heart vanished without a trace.It wasn\u2019t terrifying when one was cast aside, mocked, or held in contempt. What was terrifying was when one didn\u2019t have self-esteem, dignity, and lacked persistence! What was terrifying was when one was indiscriminate between good and evil, black and white, and unable to discern between true and false!This was something his grandfather said, and Chen Xi adhered to it firmly since he was young until it was branded into his marrow.Old man ma snorted coldly, then gazed at Chen Xi and said, \u201cThis being the case, I\u2019ll give you a chance. There\u2019s an azure tassel bamboo shoot, cut it into slices.\u201dThe entire azure tassel bamboo shoot was a verdant green like jade and contained within it was strands of spirit energy, yet it was one of the ordinary fruits and vegetables.Chen Xi moved to the stove. Placed before him was a shiny kitchen knife and a nearly 2/3m long azure tassel bamboo shoot.\u201cKnife skill is one of the important methods to judge and evaluate the standard of a spirit chef. 30% stove, 70% chopping board; a dish can\u2019t be made without a knife. Old man Ma want\u2019s to test your knife skill, do your best.\u201d Bai Wanqing explained in a low voice, her clear eyes filled with an encouraging expression.Chen Xi nodded. He picked up the azure tassel bamboo shoot and looked at it for a moment before swiftly swinging his knife!Chop! Chop! Chop!Dense and closely woven sounds of the knife slicing on the chopping board echoed out like a rhythmic drum. Chen Xi\u2019s wrist was steady like a coiled pine tree, and the shiny and sharp kitchen knife was precisely controlled by him to slice out snow white bamboo shoot slices that were as thin as a cicada\u2019s wing.Five years ago, Chen Xi had replaced his grandfather to frequently cook at home, thus he was naturally extremely familiar with using a kitchen knife. Couple that with crafting talismans throughout the year, the strength of his wrist and his precision were both outstanding. At this moment, when he put his heart and soul into it, not only were his movements smooth and precise, even his speed was extremely fast.In next to no time, an azure tassel bamboo shoot transformed into a row of neatly arranged snow white bamboo shoot slices.In the distance, old man Ma didn\u2019t even spare a glance as he said indifferently, \u201cSteady wrist strength and precise knife skill, but unfortunately the thickness differs. Only half achieved the state of being as thin as a cicada\u2019s wing, barely slightly better than an average person.\u201d\u201cThe slicing of ingredients stresses upon uniform thickness, to be as thin as a cicada\u2019s wing. Only in such a way would it allow the infusion of taste within the dish to be balanced, the cooking time to be the same, and its shape to be pleasing to the eye. If the size, thickness, and length weren\u2019t equal, it would cause the same dish to have defects such as varying taste, varying degrees of doneness and texture, and being unpleasant to the eye.\u201dPei Pei\u2019s beautiful eyes rippled with extraordinary splendour as she praised while smiling happily, \u201cLittle brother Chen Xi, your knife skill isn\u2019t bad.\u201dOld man Ma glared at Pei Pei, then raised a request with a stiff tone. \u201cSlice it into threads!\u201dChen Xi took a deep breath, then once again concentrated on the chopping board as he sliced it into threads. Obviously, the demand towards the degree of precision was even higher, thus he didn\u2019t care be careless.Chop, chop, chop\u2026The kitchen knife was like mercury spilling on the ground, as it descended down at a higher frequency that was finer and closely woven, and bamboo shoot threads that were extremely thin like hair flew out.Chen Xi felt as if he was crafting a talisman. The kitchen knife had become the talisman brush, the bamboo shoot slices had transformed into the talisman paper, and every bamboo shoot thread had become a talisman marking that was perfectly straight like a sharp sword.The drawing of talisman markings strives for the evenness of the ink marks, and every single detail had to be accurate and detailed, as it represented the entire talisman as a whole.Slicing the bamboo shoot slices into thread was similar as well, as it strived for similar length and thicknesses, and the skill of one was obviously shown between the swift movements of the knife.Strictly speaking, the difficulty of slicing the pieces into threads was far lower than drawing talisman markings, as the talisman markings drawings varied beyond a straight line and had different levels of strength applied to each marking. The drawing of talisman markings fully utilized the Dao of variation and shifting, and was far from being so singular like the movement of slicing slices into threads.Thus, after he\u2019d completely grasped the degree of strength and precision, the speed Chen Xi chopped abruptly increased, and the kitchen knife seemed as if it\u2019d come alive, dancing a joyous rhythm as it swiftly moved forward.\u201cHis movements weren\u2019t fluid in the beginning, but halfway through he completely grasped the essence of it. Could this kid be the same as me, a genius in the culinary Dao?\u201d Qiao Nan held his chin and pretended to be pondering.\u201cFuck off! You shameless fellow!\u201d The nearby Pei Pei rolled her eyes, then gazed at Chen Xi with an infatuated gaze and muttered. \u201cAn earnest man is the most handsome. Little brother Chen Xi, big sister is waiting for you to come love me, I\u2019ll love you more dearly than little sister Wanqing\u2026\u201dThis time even Bai Wanqing couldn\u2019t take it any longer, two rosy clouds appeared on her refined and fair face as she got angry from embarrassment. \u201cPei! Delusional!\u201dNevertheless, she was extremely happy in her heart, as Chen Xi being able to receive the praise of both Qiao Nan and Pei Pei was already far beyond her imagination.Old man Ma\u2019s eyes flashed brightly, but his expression remained indifferent.In Pine Mist City, so long as your living conditions weren\u2019t bad, practically no one\u2019s child would cook in the kitchen, as cooking was considered to be engaging in irrelevant work and wasting time that would be better used for cultivating. In truth it was exactly like that, unless one attained the level of skill to be a spirit chef. Ordinary people who worked as chefs were all servants, and as their master, one only needed to enjoy the fruits of their labor.Thus, after seeing Chen Xi\u2019s skill in handling the knife, old man Ma\u2019s heart was indeed moved slightly.But this was far from enough, as his culinary arts towered above all in the entire Pine Mist City, and he himself was a 3 leaf spirit chef. Thus he would absolutely not be hasty when deciding on the person to be his disciple.Chen Xi put down the kitchen knife. On the chopping board was a pile of delicate azure tassel bamboo shoot threads that were bright as snow. Each thread was fine like a cotton fibre and crystal clear, and were extremely attractive.\u201cChen Xi, well done!\u201d Bai Wanqing took the lead in giving praising him.\u201cNot bad. You have half my ability from all those years ago, but you can already be considered as extraordinarily skilled.\u201d Qiao Nan said in all seriousness.Pei Pei first rolled her eyes at the shamelessly boasting Qiao Nan, then used her fair and slender arms to hold onto her delicate and beautiful face as she muttered infatuatedly, \u201cLittle brother Chen Xi, I\u2019ve already deeply fallen in love with your earnest appearance. Oh, could this be a feeling I\u2019m unable to free myself of?\u201dAlthough he felt slightly awkward when he heard the praises of the three, but Chen Xi still felt much more at ease as he raised his head to gaze at old man Ma.\u201cHumph! Your knife skill still has a long way to go.\u201d Old man Ma\u2019s face tightened as he walked forward. His left hand picked up an azure tassel bamboo shoot thread and his right hand picked up the kitchen knife, then his wrist vibrated and a shocking scene appeared.With the bamboo shoot thread in his left hand as the target, the nearly 30cm long kitchen knife danced swiftly within his hand, as it dispersed out masses of knife afterimages that seemed like snowflakes, his skilful movements both natural and smooth.Chen Xi\u2019s eyes sprang wide open, but was completely bewildered by what he saw.\u201cHe\u2019s carving a flower!\u201d \u00a0Bai Wanqing explained in a low voice. \u201cCarving patterns onto ingredients it not only pleasing to the eye, but also allows the taste to more easily enter the dish during cooking. Especially some types of meat that are full of spirit energy, the carving of patterns on its surface allows spirit energy to be more easily absorbed.\u201dChen Xi came to a sudden understand, and secretly said to himself,He felt slightly vexed, as the kitchen knife seemed so enormous compared to a bamboo shoot thread that was fine like a cotton fibre, and not to mention carving a flower atop it, he would probably severe it the moment it came into contact with his knife.Bai Wanqing grunted coldly. \u201cHumph! It\u2019s just a lousy bamboo shoot thread, what\u2019s the point of carving on it? Don\u2019t worry, if old man Ma really asks you to carve a flower on the bamboo shoot thread, then he\u2019s intentionally making it difficult on you. I\u2019ll absolutely not approve of it!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t approve as well.\u201d Pei Pei interjected, and she intentionally shot a glance at Chen Xi as she spoke, with an appearance that said \u2018Big sister will stand up for you.\u2019Qiao Nan held his head high, and said solemnly, \u201cSince pretty lady Bai doesn\u2019t approve, then as a gentleman, I express my disapproval as well.\u201dOld man Ma\u2019s figure that was whirling the knife froze, then he swung his hand to fiercely throw the kitchen knife away, and stomped his foot in rage as he howled. \u201cIs it not enough that I accept this disciple? All I did was call him a name and all of you gang up on me?\u201d\u201cYou said it yourself!\u201d Bai Wanqing, Qiao Nan, and Pei Pei spoke in unison.Chen Xi took all this to heart, and a warmth that he\u2019d never felt in a long time flowed within his heart. He knew that with just his level of knife skill, if it wasn\u2019t out of consideration for Aunt Bai, these fellows wouldn\u2019t even bother to spare him a glance.He couldn\u2019t help but feel a burst of curiosity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After ten days, if you can\u2019t even figure out the properties of ingredients and spirit flames, then I\u2019d rather not take this disciple!\u201dOld man Ma was still not resigned, and put forward a requirement.Chen Xi didn\u2019t mind, he just pondered for a moment and then said. \u201cTen days isn\u2019t a problem. I want to know how many spirit stones I\u2019ll be able to obtain everyday once I become your disciple.\u201dOld man Ma\u2019s eyes abruptly sprang wide open, seeming to be unable to believe his ears, and his chest violently rose and fell as he suddenly howled loudly. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me as your master for the sake of earning spirit stones? My fucking culinary arts can be measured by spirit stones? You! You! You! Fuck off!\u201dBai Wanqing hurriedly pulled Chen Xi along to speed off and flee when she saw Old man Ma on the verge of going berserk.\u201cHe has character, but unfortunately he isn\u2019t as full of character as I was all those years ago.\u201d Qiao Nan rubbed his chin as he strictly evaluated.\u201cOh! Little brother Chen Xi is out of the ordinary. Only such a man is worthy of being cherished by me.\u201d Pei Pei muttered to herself, her beautiful eyes rippling with radiant splendour as she once again became delusional.\u201cFucking get back to work!\u201d Old man Ma\u2019s sharp howl was filled with infinite rage as it boomed out, and mixed within it was the sound of the iron ladle hitting the wok.\u2026After walking out of Clear Stream Restaurant, Bai Wanqing couldn\u2019t refrain from laughing incessantly with a light voice when she recalled the appearance of old man Ma when he was forced to submit by them.Chen Xi felt it to be slightly amusing as well, and he said, \u201cOld man Ma\u2019s temper is strange indeed.\u201dBai Wanqing switched the topic of conversation and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about being unable to earn spirit stones. So long as you officially become old man Ma\u2019s disciple ten days from now, the Clear Stream Restaurant will sign an agreement with you for a suitable price.\u201dChen Xi nodded, as they was what he thought as well. As the lead spirit chef of Clear Stream Restaurant, old man Ma\u2019s salary was incomparably liberal. And as the disciple of old man Ma, the Clear Stream Restaurant would only be too anxious to make offerings of spirit stones to him.Bai Wanqing seemed to have recalled something, and a slightly strange look appeared on her elegant and fair face. \u201cIf you are able to acknowledge old man Ma as your master in ten days, then perhaps you\u2019ll be able to meet the owner of Clear Stream Restaurant\u2026 A person with an extremely high ability.\u201dChen Xi was startled and in his heart as he figured that was the case. As the Clear Stream Restaurant was reputed as the number one restaurant in Pine Mist City, its owner would naturally have an extraordinary ability.Just by looking at Chen Xi\u2019s appearance, Bai Wanqing knew that he didn\u2019t understand the meaning behind her words, but she didn\u2019t explain any further. She smiled as she said, \u201cAre you going to the Zhang general store today?\u201dChen Xi shook his head. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t able to craft talismans today. If I go to the general store, Uncle Zhang would probably scold me.\u201dAs he spoke of this, he recalled the matters that happened today. Chen Hao had successfully entered the Pine Mist Institution, and he had obtained the recognition of old man Ma. For a moment, he was even more grateful to Bai Wanqing.He didn\u2019t know why Bai Wanqing would go all out to help him, but he knew that the weight of this kindness was sufficient to make him use his entire lifetime to return it!\u201cAunt Bai, thank you! Truly! Thank you!\u201d Chen Xi had a solemn expression and gazed at Bai Wanqing with extremely serious gaze as he spoke word for word.Bai Wanqing was stunned, she only recovered from her shock after some time and feelings fluctuated within her heart. Suddenly, she extended out her slender and white hand to pinch Chen Xi\u2019s face, then smiled happily. \u201cSmile more in the future. Don\u2019t stiffen your face and be insulted as a deadpan. The nickname Deadpan Chen is really too unpleasant to the ear.\u201dChen Xi was muddled by Bai Wanqing\u2019s unexpected actions, and when he recovered from his shock after some time, a rare trace of a flushed face appeared on his pale and handsome face.\u201cHa! Your face has gone red!\u201d Bai Wanqing blinked her eyes with a face full of a mischievous smile.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t take it any longer, and didn\u2019t pay any attention to Bai Wanqing anymore, only concentrating on walking swiftly, but in his heart he instead extremely enjoyed this warm feeling.\u2026Within a large hall in the Li Clan.\u201cUseless son! Trash!\u201d The wine cup in Li Yizhen\u2019s hand transformed into a pile of dust with a crash, his steadfast and dignified face was gloomy and his eyes almost spurted fire as he shouted explosively. \u201cInjuring another on the streets and defying the authority of the General\u2019s Estate. These are all great things you\u2019ve done!\u201d\u201cFather, your son took a beating. How can the General\u2019s Estate be so indiscriminate?\u201d Li Ming summoned up courage to absolve himself from responsibility.Li Yizhen\u2019s face went even gloomier, and coldly stared at his youngest son. \u201cYou\u2019re still clamorous and domineering even when your skills are inferior to another. And you actually used such a terrible humiliation like taking a beating as a reason to absolve yourself from responsibility. If you weren\u2019t my son, I would surely kill you with my own two hands!\u201dLi Ming\u2019s face suddenly went pale, and his entire body trembled, not daring to speak another word.\u201cHmph!\u201d Li Yizhen grunted coldly and his gaze descended on Manager Wu as he questioned in a low voice. \u201cManager Wu, since you\u2019ve made a move, why didn\u2019t you kill that Chen Hao? Do you know how much of a passive position your incompetence put me in?\u201dManager Wu sweated profusely, his heart thumping as he maintained dead silence.He knew that for the sake of calming the rage of the General\u2019s Estate, the Patriarch had paid the painful price of a graded magic treasure. Under these circumstances, he didn\u2019t dare to justify himself at all and only said in a low voice. \u201cI originally had 100% certainty to kill Chen Hao, but I encountered the surprise attack of Chen Xi midway. I was caught off guard and the two brothers snuck off. Patriarch, please impart your punishment upon me!\u201dLi Yizhen\u2019s enraged expression slightly eased up. \u201cChen Xi? Could it be that he\u2019s already attained the level of perfection within the Congenital Realm?\u201dManager Wu became even more ashamed. \u201cNo. The kid is skilled in crafting talismans and is ruthlessly cunning. He first utilized a Stealth Talisman and Aura Restraining Talisman to conceal himself at the side, then used an Icicle Talisman to launch a sneak attack on me. Not one of the moments he chose didn\u2019t hit this old servants vulnerabilities, so\u2026\u201dLi Yizhen was startled and seemed lost in thought. \u201cI\u2019ve promised those over at the southern territory that when these two brothers attain perfection within the Congenital Realm, I\u2019ll cripple their cultivations. I\u2019ll cause them to have no fate with the path to immortality, and make be overwhelmed with grief to the point they wished to die, then be tormented to death. It\u2019s precisely because of this that I\u2019ve never once taken the two of them seriously, but now it would seem that I should pay slight attention to them.\u201dManager Wu said respectfully. \u201cI wonder if Patriarch has any plans, this old servant is willing to follow by Patriarch\u2019s side and will not refuse an order under any circumstances!\u201dLi Yizhen shook his head and sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve just received news, that Chen Hao had already entered the Pine Mist Institution to cultivate. The Pine Mist Institution had tremendous strength that is on par with my Li Clan. So we\u2019re temporarily unable to make a move against him. That kid really got off lightly.\u201dManager Wu seemed to have thought of something and his eyes lit up. \u201cPatriarch, all the institutions within Pine Mist City will be participating in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials. Chen Hao has already cultivated to the Congenital Realm and will surely participate. Furthermore, the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain is situated within the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, thus the General\u2019s Estate is unable to interfere. At that time, we will only have to send a few people to conceal themselves within, and they would surely be able to kill that kid!\u201dLi Yizhen pondered then said, \u201cThis plan isn\u2019t bad. But, you can\u2019t kill him, and instead must cripple his cultivation.\u201dA trace of viciousness flashed within Manager Wu\u2019s eyes and he sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Patriarch, this old servant will surely be able to take out that kid at that time!\u201d\u201cFantastic! I\u2019ll be going at that time as well!\u201d Li Ming cried out in joy and his gaze was filled with utmost hatred, obviously he already hated Chen Hao to the bones.Li Yizhen coldly said, \u201cWanting to take revenge isn\u2019t a bad thing. From today onwards, you don\u2019t have to go to the Skystar Institution, and instead will cultivate in closed doors within the Ancestral House. When you\u2019re able to attain perfection within the Congenital Realm, then at that time you may come out!\u201dLi Ming\u2019s legs abruptly started shaking and his face went pale.\u201cIron Hand, take the Young Master. I\u2019ll leave his cultivation up to you.\u201d Li Yizhen instructed indifferently.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d A wisp of a shadow suddenly appeared behind Li Yizhen, and a gaunt and tall black clothed man silently appeared.His appearance was mediocre and ordinary, and no distinguishing characteristic could be perceived. But when Li Ming saw him, it was as if he\u2019d seen the devil and his mouth trembled as he said, \u201cFather, can\u2026\u201dHis voice abruptly stopped.Iron Hand swiftly appeared by Li Ming\u2019s side like a ghost, then swung his hand to knock Li Ming out before grabbing Li Ming up like holding a chick, directly leaving the large hall.A trace of unbearableness flashed within Li Yizhen\u2019s eyes and was subsequently replaced with a sense of firmness, then he muttered. \u201cSpare the rod and spoil the child. If you can\u2019t even achieve perfection within the Congenital Realm, then what qualification do you have to compete with your older brother for the position of Patriarch? The Li Clan doesn\u2019t need trash!\u201dManager Wu was stunned by the scene that unfolded before him. Iron Hand? That Violet Palace Realm expert that was always concealed within the shadows and considered himself to be a shadow? That number one slaughterer of the Li Clan whose hands were stained densely with blood?Being watched by such a freak while cultivating, the following days of the Young Master would probably only be able to be described as too horrible to look at, right?Without any reason, a trace of pity arose within Manager Wu\u2019s heart.\u201cManager Wu, there\u2019s still one more matter I want you to take care of.\u201d Li Yizhen frowned and pondered for a moment before making the decision.Manager Wu was jolted back to reality, and he took a deep breath the said in a loud voice. \u201cPlease give me you instructions, Patriarch!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s inadvisable for us to offend the General\u2019s Estate in the near future, but we can\u2019t let that Chen Xi off so easily as well. Next month, I want you to cripple his cultivation first!\u201d\u2026After bidding his farewell to Bai Wanqing, Chen Xi directly returned home and had a rushed meal before starting to comprehend the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts.The things that took place these past few days were too numerous and caused a strong sense of urgency to arise within him, thus he didn\u2019t dare slack off in the slightest.Most importantly, no matter it it was qi refinement, body refinement, visualizing the True Body Brand, or earning money by crafting talismans, they would all occupy a large amount of his time. Now that he had an extra culinary arts, his time seemed even tighter. So he would absolutely not allow himself to waste a shred of time.Chen Xi didn\u2019t know how others treated their time, but he knew that if he wanted to become strong, if he wanted to take revenge for his grandfather and the Chen Clan, and if he wanted to meet his mother, then he couldn\u2019t loosen the requirements he imposed on himself.On the contrary, for the sake of achieving these objectives, he would have to impose even harsher requirements on himself, no matter how hard. Even if he had to sweat an extra drop of sweat, in no event would he give himself a reason to slack off!Holding this sort of thought, Chen Xi drew up a cultivation plan for himself. In the morning he would craft talismans, then train in the culinary arts; at night, he would cultivate the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts, the Violet Sky Arts, and visualize the True Body Brand.As for how much time remained for him to sleep wasn\u2019t within his consideration.Of course, if Chen Xi was able to attain the Violet Palace Realm and become a Violet Palace cultivator, sleeping or not was of no great importance.\u201cThe body refiners in the world mostly use the energy of stone, gold, lightning, fire, and water to temper their physique. But I\u2019ve never heard of drawing upon the baleful qi of the stars to temper the physique. This Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts is able to develop a new method, and is indeed marvellous!\u201dAs if he\u2019d opened up a mysterious window, Chen Xi\u2019s eyes were unusually bright. He carefully savoured the lines of beautiful characters within his mind with dense curiosity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14- CultivatingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14- CultivatingThe Universe Starslayer Body Forging Technique was divided into seven levels.The first level: Refining the skin with metal \u2014 The Seventh Goldstar baleful qi is drawn upon to temper the skin.The second level: Toughening the bones with fire \u2014 The Blazing Firestar baleful qi is drawn upon to toughen the bone.The third level: Kneading the tendons with water \u2014 The Flexible Waterstar baleful qi is drawn upon to knead the tendons.The fourth level: Tempering the muscles with earth \u2014 The Thick Earthstar baleful qi is drawn upon to temper the flesh and blood.The fifth level: Molding the body with wood \u2014 The Pure Woodstar baleful qi is drawn upon to remold the physique.Up until here, the body refinement for the Postnatal Realm had attained perfection.\u201cIt\u2019s formidable as expected. Able to cultivate to perfection within the Congenital Realm just by tempering the entire body through the baleful qi of stars with the five elements. It\u2019s far more concise and explicit than a qi refinement technique.\u201dChen Xi exclaimed in admiration, then frowned and muttered. \u201cHowever, simple doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy. Body refining methods were originally extremely difficult, and one who doesn\u2019t have great perseverance and great willpower is utterly unable to endure the pain brought about from body refinement. This Universe Starslayer Body Forging Technique comes from the master of the Manor and can even be traced back to the Primordial Era of a million years ago. Cultivating it will probably be even more difficult than an ordinary body refinement technique.\u201dChen Xi\u2019s mind calmed down a great deal when he thought of this, and he continued to read downwards.The sixth level was the Congenital Realm of body refinement. Once one arrived at this level, the vital energy and blood of the entire body would rise like steam, the qi and vital energy would run through the body like a rainbow, and one would possess tremendous strength capable of moving mountains.The seventh level was the Violet Palace Realm of body refinement. Once one arrives at this level, a terrifying mysterious energy would flow out from between the flesh, blood, and periosteum \u2014 Shaman Energy! Relying on Shaman Energy, one could cultivate secret arts, divine abilities, and techniques unique to body refiners. For example, the Mountain Transforming Fist, Heavenly Transformation, Immovable Gold Body, etc.\u201cShaman Energy? Could it be that it\u2019s similar to the True Essence cultivated by qi refiners? What are divine abilities and techniques? Unfortunately, I have very little knowledge in the field of body refining. I must find a chance to figure all of this out, otherwise, there\u2019ll surely be some stagnation when cultivating it.\u201dChen Xi silently pondered, then abruptly thought of another problem. \u201cThis Universe Starslayer Body Forging Technique is from the master of the Manor, and would surely exceed these. Could it be that the more profound stages are still within the grasps of Senior Ji Yu?\u201d\u201cNever mind, it\u2019s useless to think any more, I should quickly attain the Violet Palace Realm. Then when I enter the Manor again, so long as I\u2019m able to pass the 1st level of the Heavenpeak of Trials, Senior Ji Yu ought to pass down the later content of the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Technique to me.\u201d\u2026Chen Xi stood up and went out of his house.The night sky was pitch black, and stars that were like bright pearls flickered atop the curtain of night, sprinkling down chilly starlight that was enchanting and profound.Chen Xi raised his head and silently thought over the cultivation technique for the first level of the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Technique as he gazed upon the myriad stars in the sky. After a long time, his eyebrows knit into a frown as he muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult!\u201dThe Universe Starslayer Body Forging Technique had a few great barriers, and initiation was one of them.If one wanted to draw upon the Seventh Goldstar baleful qi to refine one\u2019s physique, the first step would require sensing Venus, the star that was filled with Seventh Goldstar baleful qi. The second step would be to form a connection with Venus, with one\u2019s body as the center. Only then could one successfully attract and draw up the Seventh Goldstar baleful qi to temper the skin.Among the myriad of stars, Venus was the brightest, and if one were to carefully identify it, it wouldn\u2019t take long to find it. As for using the Seventh Goldstar baleful qi to temper the skin, it wasn\u2019t considered to be too difficult, and only needed to cultivate according to the cultivation technique.The most difficult was the second step, sensing Venus and forming a connection with it.Luckily, a detailed method of sensing Venus was record within the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Technique, and even though the method was complicated, it resolved Chen Xi\u2019s urgent need.\u201cSuccess or not, it\u2019s never wrong to try\u2026\u201d Chen Xi took a deep breath, and only until his state of mind maintained utmost tranquillity did he slowly close his eyes. He sat cross-legged on the courtyard floor, and lightly raised his head to face the brightest star in the faraway horizon.He then weakly supported his hands before his chest, his fingers twisted like vines to form dense amounts of ancient seals which had a faint sense of mysteriousness and profundity.One by one, hand seals were born and destroyed like the rising and falling of the tide, seeming to have no end.After seven minutes, Chen Xi suddenly stopped, his right palm held the heavens, and his left palm took in the earth. He wasn\u2019t moving anymore, like a silent stone carving that emitted an unusual tranquillity.Ding!A noise like a camel bell faintly echoing out from the faraway desert, bringing along a trace of tranquil energy that cleansed the soul, resounded throughout Chen Xi\u2019s sea of consciousness.\u201cHe started cultivating?\u201d Within the Manor, Ji Yu raised his head from the surging river, seeming to be listening to something, His deep gaze filled with life experience revealed a trace of an unusual expression, seeming excited, but also sentimental\u2026Chen Xi felt like he\u2019d grown wings and flown up into the heavens, rushing towards the deep reaches of the night sky, not knowing exhaustion nor knowing the end of the sky.Flying past dazzling stars that fluttered and floated in the sky, one by one.Flying past deep and quiet black holes that caused a lingering fear in one\u2019s heart, one by one.Flying past groups of meteor showers that were like blooming fireworks, one by one.In the end, he stopped in an expanse of boundless space, and there was only one star here, an enormous star that emitted millions upon millions of gold lights.The gold light was sharp like a sword, and the entire star seemed as if it was filled with countless swords that emitted a sharp cold aura which surged strongly as it gushed out, causing one to dare not look closely at it.Chen Xi\u2019s mind was enlightened at the moment fortune approached, and he sat cross-legged in space with a tranquil expressions as he silently closed his eyes.Right at this moment, a strand of chilly and fluid starlight poured down from above the star filled night sky, like a silent drizzle that was continuous and dense, descending into the courtyard and sprinkling all around Chen Xi\u2019s body.The scene was extremely novel, as if a bridge of light that was thin like a towline had been built between the heavens and the earth, connecting Chen Xi with Venus!Seeming to have noticed something, thousands of extremely shocking and terrifying auras emerged from the vast and boundless southern territory, and gaze after gaze shot faraway into the south with expressions of bewilderment, shock, perplexion, etc.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Within Pine Mist City, figures rose up from the ground in various places across the city and stood in mid-air as their gazes shot towards the same place in unison \u2014 The commoners district.However, when everyone desired to investigate to the end, they noticed in astonishment that the night sky was ink black and everything had returned to normal. They weren\u2019t able to sense that strange energy that suddenly emerged, as if nothing had happened all along.No one doubted what they sensed earlier. They searched over and over in reluctance, but they didn\u2019t have a shred of discovery anymore, and could only return with bewilderment and without accomplishing anything.\u2026\u201cHaha, my Master awaited and finally obtained a disciple that\u2019s able to inherit his mantle with great difficulty, how could I allow all of you to make trouble?\u201d Within the Manor, Ji Yu looked up into the heavens as he burst into laughter, his mood unspeakably joyous.After a long time, Ji Yu\u2019s expression returned calm, and he muttered. \u201cKid, work hard. A true expert doesn\u2019t need the protection of anyone. I won\u2019t make an exception and help you anymore in the future. Unless\u2026 You can pass all the trials of the Heavenpeak!\u201dChen Xi was entirely unaware of this.Beside him, innumerable starlights fluttered, and the color of the starlight slowly changed to a pure and eye piercing gold.\u201cSuccess!\u201d Chen Xi opened his eyes and gazed at the specks of golden light that lightly fluttered by his body like fireflies and muttered. \u201cThis is the Seventh Goldstar baleful qi?\u201dHe was extremely excited in his heart, and circulated the first level of the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Technique mental cultivation technique without the slightest hesitation!Hiss! Hiss!Suddenly, the Seventh Goldstar baleful qi that fluttered in the surrounding abruptly stopped for a moment, then transformed into sharp gold lights that were thin like hairs to suddenly fuse into the skin on Chen Xi\u2019s entire body.Even though he\u2019d already prepared himself, when the Seventh Goldstar baleful qi came into contact with his body, it still hurt until Chen Xi was nearly unable to control his body. It felt as if thousands of sharp silver needles were fiercely piercing his body simultaneously and his entire body trembled ceaselessly.The Seventh Goldstar baleful qi contained the sharp qi that the stars condensed as they revolved, and it was incomparably pure, thus it naturally was extremely painful when used to temper the skin of the body.The veins on Chen Xi\u2019s forehead bulged explosively and he looked extraordinarily savage as he clenched his teeth tightly, trying hard to maintain the last thread of consciousness in his head as he slowly circulated his cultivation technique.The pain was like a tide, each wave fiercer than the other. Strands of dark red blood spilt out of the skin and pores on Chen Xi\u2019s entire body and he quickly became covered in blood.After an unknown amount of time, Chen Xi slowly ceased circulating his cultivation technique. His mind had been tortured by the pain, to the point that it was completely without a shred of consciousness. He originally desired to stand up, but he felt his entire body lacking even a shred of strength. Only boundless pain and exhaustion remained, making him unable to even stand.\u201cJust the first barrier of initiation has already tortured me to this state. Looks like what Senior Ji Yu said is true, my body is indeed too frail\u2026\u201dChen Xi didn\u2019t become dejected, as this fact caused him to understand a lot, and also allowed him to clearly recognize the condition of his body.After meditating for a moment and waiting for his body to recover a sliver of strength, he once again clenched his teeth tightly as he used his arms to slowly prop his body up. He eventually stood, but he\u2019d already sweated profusely from the pain.He staggered step by step to walk into the house, then used cold water to wash off the blood covering his body before sitting cross-legged on his bed while breathing heavily.Even if he felt pain and exhaustion to the utmost limit, Chen Xi still didn\u2019t waste a moment before starting to cultivate the Violet Sky Arts.His way of thinking was extremely simple, containing only two words: Become strong!Without firm convictions and persistent actions, he would never know how strong he is in the end, right?Chen Xi was working hard silently and firmly.\u2026Early in the morning the next day, Chen Xi woke up on time.After he cultivated the Violet Sky Arts last night, he sat cross-legged in meditation within his sea of consciousness and visualized the True Body Brand left behind by the master of the Manor according to the instructions of Ji Yu. He only fell into a deep slumber right before dawn.So even though his complexion was unusually pale, his spirit was extremely well.Chen Xi suddenly noticed that his six senses[1. Six senses refers to the usual five senses and the added sense of the consciousness.] seemed to have become unusually sensitive overnight.The leaves on the tree outside the courtyard gently swayed as they emitted strands of sounds that were like a heavenly flute; Rows of ants marching in the crevices at the corner, laboriously transporting food; Under the eaves of the house, a butterfly fluttered on the spot as it bathed in the morning sun with a graceful and lively bearing\u2026Everything was so full of vigor, and it all caused Chen Xi to feel novel and wonder.\u201cIt\u2019s surely because of visualizing that Fuxi Divine Statue that my soul has become stronger!\u201dIn almost an instant, Chen Xi understood everything, and he couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in surprise. \u201cIt actually caused my soul to attain this state in a mere night, the True Body Brand that Senior Fuxi left behind is indeed extraordinary!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15- Wondrous Effect of the SoulPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15- Wondrous Effect of the SoulThese past five years, crafting talismans at dawn had already become a habit of Chen Xi\u2019s, no matter if it was rain or shine.Today was no exception.After Chen Xi washed up, he sat before the wooden table and started crafting talismans.Different from before, due to the skin on his entire body faintly aching, his wrist that he drew with obviously had a trace of jerkiness, and his speed had slowed down a great deal as well. It would probably be impossible for him to complete 30 first-grade talisman within five hours.However, Chen Xi took no notice of this, and his gaze concentrated on the talisman paper with a meticulously attentive expression.According to the requirements of the Zhang general store, the first-grade basic talisman he needed to craft today was the Earthshield Talisman.The Earthshield Talisman was an earth attribute basic talisman that prioritized defence. One would be able to condense a shield that was like solid rock before one\u2019s self when utilizing it. The structure of the talisman markings weren\u2019t complicated, and had a similar difficulty to the Flamecloud Talisman, but the attribute of the two were completely different.However, this was completely unable to hinder Chen Xi, as during these five years, although he was mocked as trash who could only craft basic talismans. But if one were to speak of the number of basic talismans mastered, then no one was able to compare to him.He had no choice, for the sake of earning spirit stones, he had to learn how to craft basic talismans of various attributes, as only in this way would he be able to obtain spirit stones from the Zhang general store.Until today, the number of basic talismans that Chen Xi mastered proficiently was probably over a thousand, and if this number were to be made public, it would surely cause everyone to be flabbergasted and dare not believe it.Normally speaking, most talisman masters choose a path of talisman crafting that was suitable to them from the five elemental attributes, then studied and practised in it to swiftly increase their cultivation in the Dao of talismans.Whereas Chen Xi instead welcomed practising all the basic talismans of the five elements. Even though he\u2019d already skilfully mastered them by heart, he spent even more time than other talisman masters. Only heaven knew if it was worth it.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!The tip of the brush that was stained sufficiently in ink floated atop the snow-white and soft talisman paper, drawing line after line of smooth and winding talisman markings. Chen Xi\u2019s brush technique was precise and agile, seeming to not be affected by his wrist strength.However, when he\u2019d crafted this Earthshield Talisman halfway, an uncomfortable feeling abruptly arose within his heart, as if there was a mistake on the talisman markings. But when he looked carefully, he didn\u2019t notice a trace of a careless mistake.Chen Xi frowned and stopped drawing, then silently pondered. He\u2019d crafted no less than a hundred thousand Earthshield Talismans over these five years, and his brush technique had already attained the state of being able to finish crafting it without stopping.Chen Xi took a deep breath then once again carefully inspected the talisman paper on the table \u2014 the point he started drawing, the symmetry of the ink markings, the talisman markings pathway\u2026 The more he looked at it, the more he felt uncomfortable in his heart, as if his chest was filled with bricks, causing his breathing to become hurried.As if he was struck by a bolt of lightning, a trace of a strong urge arose abruptly within Chen Xi\u2019s heart, and as if he was possessed, he picked up the talisman brush then swung it downwards!The talisman marking pathways atop the talisman paper abruptly changed, the talisman marking that originally ought to be fine and intricate were simply completed by Chen Xi with a single stroke, and instead dense and complicated patterns were drawn by him at the end.Bang!After drawing the last stroke, Chen Xi put down the talisman brush and breathed heavily with his hand pressed upon the wooden table, but his eyes were instead shockingly bright.After a short moment, Chen Xi took up the talisman paper, and couldn\u2019t help but frown as he gazed upon the talisman markings that were only partially familiar.\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll test it first, if it\u2019s wasted, then it\u2019s wasted\u2026\u201d Chen Xi pondered for a moment and was unable to understand it, so a strand of True Essence gushed out from the tip of his finger and poured into the talisman paper.Whoosh!A dense earthen yellow stream suddenly emerged, and a turtle shaped shield that was as tall as a person appeared within Chen Xi\u2019s hand.Chen Xi heaved a sigh of relief, and at the same time a wisp of shock suddenly surged within his heart. The structure of talisman markings had experienced infinite years to develop, and had long since formed a fixed structure. The Earthshield Talisman was one of such talismans, as the structure of talisman markings within it had long since been perfected by countless almighty wise men of the past. Not to mention modifying the talisman markings, even a slight divergence on the pathway of the talisman markings would possibly cause the entire talisman to fail.Whereas at this moment, this Earthshield Talisman\u2019s marking pathways had been altered by nearly 50%, but it was still able to be successfully utilized. How could it not cause Chen Xi to be shocked?The knowledge of talismans within Chen Xi\u2019s mind nearly crumbled when he realized this, he simple dared not believe that the Earthshield Talisman before him was made by his own two hands.Then, he was perplexed by a trace of uncertainty, how did he do it earlier?After bitterly pondering for a long time, Chen Xi abruptly recalled a matter: Senior Fuxi visualized the River Diagram to comprehend the Dao of deducing the secrets of the heavens, and not only did he rely on his knowledge in the Dao of talismans to walk out of the Star Secret Realm, he even obtained the True Body Brand left behind by Senior Fuxi.Senior Ji Yu had once said, the True Body Brand contained a trace of the River Diagram\u2019s true essence, and he\u2019d visualized this True Body brand last night.Couple with the strengthening of his six senses when he awoke earlier, Chen Xi almost instantly understood that all this was surely related to him visualizing the True Body Brand within his sea of consciousness that was left behind by the master of the Manor!It looked like this method of visualizing wasn\u2019t merely capable of allowing his soul to become stronger, it was even able to silently benefit his comprehension in the Dao of talismans.When Chen Xi straightened out his thinking and was suddenly enlightened, he took up the talisman brush and once again started crafting.Time flowed by, in practically not even three hours, 30 Earthshield Talismans that were completely different from those used in society had appeared into the world, and it was an entire two hours faster than before!Two hours! It was sufficient for Chen Xi to do many things!What caused Chen Xi to be happy the most was that the True Essence within his Dantian wasn\u2019t completed depleted as usual, and instead more than half still remained. This also meant that he was completely capable of crafting another 30 Earthshield Talismans, and would we able to earn an extra 10 spirit stones daily!Chen Xi took a deep breath and forcefully restrained this pleasant surprise, then stood up and walked out of his home.Zhang general store.Zhang Dayong stood behind the counter. The moment he saw Chen Xi enter, he feigned rage as he said, \u201cKid, why were you absent without a reason yesterday? Do you think you\u2019ve grown up and become independent to the point you don\u2019t intend to work for me?\u201dA wisp of warmth emerged from Chen Xi\u2019s heart, as during these five years, if it wasn\u2019t for Uncle Zhang always taking care of him, his entire family would probably have lost its source of livelihood long ago.Five years ago, he\u2019d only just learned how to craft basic talismans. He went everywhere to sell them, but there was rarely anyone who showed interest, and no retailer was willing to buy them. The consumption of basic talismans within Pine Mist City was extremely great and retailers were much more willing to purchase in batches, whereas at that time, Chen Xi was only capable of crafting five basic talismans a day, and was utterly unable to enter the eyes of the retailers.Luckily, he chanced upon Zhang Dayong, who expressed his willingness to purchase the talismans Chen Xi crafted, with a price similar to the market price. It had been like this throughout these five years, and Zhang Dayong had never once gone back on his words. This caused Chen Xi to be incomparably grateful to Zhang Dayong, and thus he had always taken Zhang Dayong as a senior that was most worthy of trust and respect.\u201cUncle Zhang, these are the 30 Earthshield Talismans for today.\u201d Chen Xi withdrew a pile of talismans and passed them over.Zhang Dayong scolded with a smile. \u201cI knew you\u2019d change the topic, kid.\u201dAs he spoke, he received the pile of talismans and didn\u2019t even glance at is as he casually placed it on the counter, then withdrew 10 spirit stones and tossed it to Chen Xi as he joked. \u201cKid, it\u2019s already been five years, when do you plan to craft second-grade talismans?\u201dChen Xi replied. \u201cI already intend to craft them, I only lack the money to buy the books.\u201dZhang Dayong was originally joking, but he never expected to receive a serious answer from Chen Xi, and was slightly startled before bursting into laughter. \u201cThen I\u2019ll be waiting for you to craft second-grade talismans. I\u2019ll buy as many as you have with a price that surely fair.\u201dChen Xi\u2019s heart was incomparably warm as he gazed at the undisguised encouragement in Zhang Dayong\u2019s smile, and he nodded solemnly. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll master it as soon as possible.\u201dChen Xi took the 10 spirit stones and a jade slip book, then turned around and left.\u201cThe jinx has finally left\u2026\u201d A talisman crafting apprentice arrived before the counter and picked up an Earthshield Talisman with a cheeky grin on his face. When he saw clearly the structure of the talisman markings on it, he couldn\u2019t help but be astonished. \u201cUncle Zhang, is this an Earthshield Talisman?\u201d\u201cStinking kid, you\u2019ve practiced for more than half a month and you can\u2019t even recognize an Earthshield Talisman. If you don\u2019t work hard, then pack up and scram!\u201d Zhang Dayong frowned as he berated, but when his gaze descended onto the talisman paper, he couldn\u2019t help but be dumbstruck.Since managing the general store for nearly 30 years, the various basic talismans that passed through his hands were no less than a hundred, thus Zhang Dayong\u2019s eyesight had become incomparably sharp since long ago. In practically an instant, he\u2019d discerned that the structure of the talisman markings on this Earthshield Talisman had been completely altered.A trace of an uncomfortable feeling surged from Zhang Dayong\u2019s heart. In these years, there were some talisman crafting apprentices got up to little tricks thinking they\u2019d be able to get away with it, but how could they get past Zhang Dayong\u2019s eyes? Zhang Dayong extremely detested these fellows that resorted to fraud, and would absolutely not show mercy and send them packing.Now, the kid that he trusted the most had very likely done this, Zhang Dayong was slightly unable to accept this, and his face slowly went gloomy.The unusual scene before the counter slowly drew the attention of the other people within the store, and they crowded over.\u201cOh! This is the Earthshield Talisman that Deadpan Chen crafted? Why does it look fake the more I look at it?\u201d\u201cSeems like it to me too. The Earthshield Talisman isn\u2019t crafted like this, the structure of the talisman markings on the top are completely wrong. This fellow Chen Xi has really gone too far!\u201d\u201cExactly! Uncle Zhang had looked after him for so many years, but he doesn\u2019t know to feel grateful and repay the kindness, but instead used this shit to deceive others. It\u2019s indeed shameless.\u201d\u2026Humming sounds of discussions rose and fell, and more or less, there were traces of taking pleasure in Zhang Dayong\u2019s misfortune on their face.Zhang Dayong\u2019s face became even more unsightly as time passed, and his heart ached extremely. He\u2019d already decided, that if Chen Xi didn\u2019t give him an answer that is satisfactory tomorrow, he\u2019d completely cut off the relationship and not buy the talismans that Chen Xi crafted any longer!\u201cLet me see!\u201d A voice that was like a twitter of an oriole in a clear valley abruptly sounded out, and a young girl in a simple dress passed the crowd of people. She was comely, with skin that was like snow, and had an appearance that was extremely sweet and beautiful. She\u2019d only just appeared and had instantly attracted the attention of everyone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - Little PrincessPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16 - Little PrincessThe young girl in a simple dress completely paid no attention to the surrounding gazes as she stretched out her hand to pick up an Earthshield Talisman and studied it for a moment, then a trace of bewilderment arose within her starry eyes. Obviously, she was unable to recognize the structure of the talisman markings on the top of the talisman.Dense curiosity arose in the heart of the young girl in a simple dress, and she said in a clear voice. \u201cBoss, do you mind if I try the might of this talisman?\u201dZhang Dayong was startled, then sighed. \u201cMiss, you don\u2019t have to try. I\u2019ve managed this small store for 30 years, and have handled countless talismans. How could I be unable to identify the genuineness of an Earthshield Talisman? Even you\u2019ve seen it. The structure of the talisman markings on these Earthshield Talismans are completely wrong, there\u2019s no use in trying it.\u201d\u201cExactly! Exactly! Uncle Zhang is surely correct. The talismans this fellow Chen Xi crafted today is absolutely a scam. There\u2019s no point in trying it.\u201dThe surrounding talisman crafting disciples agreed in unison. Their identities were lowly, and they had never come into close contact with such a beautiful young girl, thus they naturally firmly grasped all opportunities to please her.\u201cHow would you know its genuineness without trying?\u201d The young girl in a simple dress lightly smiled, like a lotus bud blooming after the rain, beautiful and refined. As she spoke, she\u2019d already arrived at an empty space and with a swing of her white hand, a pure and thick strand of True Essence poured into the talisman paper.A shocking scene appeared, the talisman suddenly transformed into a dense earthen yellow gentle light that ceaselessly roiled, then condensed into an enormous shield that was like the shape of a turtle. Bright lights coiled around it as it emitted a thick and solid aura.Whoosh!The indifference in the gazes of everyone instantly transformed into disbelief, and their appearances were as if they\u2019d seen a ghost.Zhang Dayong couldn\u2019t help but be extremely astounded,As if the guess in her heart obtained affirmation, the eyes of the young girl in a simple dress abruptly shone, and without hesitation, her left hand was covered fully by thick True Essence before fiercely slapping her hand onto the turtle shaped shield.Bang!A loud clunk sounded out and a burst of violent fluctuating ripples appeared on the surface of the turtle shaped shield, and it quickly recovered to its previous state.The eyes of the young girl in a simple dress grew brighter when she saw this, then once again urged her True Essence before flipping her delicate hand to carry along an ear piercing howl of the wind as it hit onto the surface of the shield.Whoosh! Whoosh!The turtle shaped shield violently fluctuated, and the spirit energy suffused within it became exceedingly dim, it was already on the verge of collapse.The young girl in a simple dress was dumbstruck, then a wisp of excitement flowed out from within her eyes. She casually shattered the turtle shaped shield that couldn\u2019t withstand another blow before arriving before the counter and saying, \u201cBoss, I want all of these Earthshield Talismans!\u201dZhang Dayong had long since been shocked to the point he was stunned from the series of unforeseen events before him, and he abruptly awoke from his shock when he heard her, but he hesitated and kept silent.Through the test of the young girl in a simple dress earlier, he\u2019d already perceived that the Earthshield Talisman\u2019s Chen Xi crafted this time had a might that far surpassed the ordinary, even to the extent it was able to compare with a second-grade talisman.The young girl in a simple dress frowned and said in an unhappy tone. \u201cBoss, don\u2019t lie about the price. I\u2019ll at most give you one spirit stone for an Earthshield Talisman.\u201dZhang Dayong didn\u2019t try to conceal it when his thoughts were seen through, and smiled brilliantly. \u201cMiss, I can sell this Earthshield Talisman to you, but I can\u2019t sell them all to you. Even you know that the structure of the talisman markings of the Earthshield Talisman have experienced endless years of perfection, and the structure of the talisman markings had long since arrived at the most perfect state. Wanting to alter it again is simply an impossible matter. However the appearance of these Earthshield Talisman\u2019s before our eyes is no different from a miracle. Under these circumstances, I naturally have to keep some and use them to completely boost the reputation of my store!\u201cThink about it. A new structure of talisman markings emerging into the world, what sort of a sensational matter it would be to the entire talisman profession? And being able to manage these new type of Earthshield Talisman\u2019s at the first possible moment is the great fortune of my Zhang general store!\u201dThe more he spoke, the more Zhang Dayong got excited, and his eyes emitted boundless hope, as if he\u2019d already seen the glorious future.The young girl in a simple dress scrunched up her nose, and she had no choice but to compromise. In the end, she purchased 15 Earthshield Talismans for the price of 15 spirit stones.\u201cUncle Zhang, what you say couldn\u2019t be\u2026 be true right?\u201d A talisman crafting apprentice walked up with a face full of astonishment.\u201cYeah, the Earthshield Talisman Chen Xi crafted isn\u2019t as formidable as you said. Isn\u2019t it only a basic talisman, how can it be called a miracle?\u201dThe other talisman crafting apprentices spoke out as well. The talismans that were originally equivalent to fraud had suddenly become a miraculous matter that could stir the entire talisman profession. For a time, they felt unable to wrap their heads around the matter.Most importantly, these Earthshield Talismans were crafted by the Jinx, Chen Xi. In this way, wouldn\u2019t it mean that this fellow would rise in status as well?Zhang Dayong swept everyone with his gaze then coldly said, \u201cI know that all of you think Chen Xi is a jinx, and it serves him right to be worse than all of you and be ridiculed by all of you, right?\u201d\u201cBut I want to tell all of you that if you want to continue working here, then don\u2019t let me hear you mention even a bit of an unpleasant remark about Chen Xi. Otherwise, pack your bags and leave!\u201d Zhang Dayong\u2019s voice abruptly went exceedingly cold and stern.Everyone was silent like a cicada in cold weather.Yet Zhang Dayong still felt furious and embarrassed, he wasn\u2019t vexed towards these apprentices, but instead resented himself for nearly misunderstanding Chen Xi.Zhang Dayong made a decision, then he recalled the young girl in a simple dress from earlier, and he had the feeling as if he\u2019d seen her somewhere.Clap!After silently pondering for a long while, Zhang Dayong suddenly slapped his forehead, then muttered. \u201cNo wonder she seemed so familiar. The Jade-severing Palm she used earlier is the profound skill that General Qin of the General\u2019s Estate used to become famous, she ought to be the little master of the Generals Estate \u2014 Qin Hongmian!\u201d\u2026\u201cIf you want to become a qualified spirit chef, then you must master the eight great sections \u2014 the ingredients, knife skills, the stove, the spirit flames, the utensils, the seasoning, the water, and the cooking method. Amongst them, the ingredients, knife skills, and the spirit flames are of the utmost importance and the others doesn\u2019t require much study.\u201cThis records tens of thousands of spirit herbs, fruits and vegetables, grains, demon beasts, wild animals, etc. It can be said to be all-encompassing and lacks nothing. What you need to do is become familiar with the various different grades of ingredients. Then understand its attributes, taste, color, and the substance that\u2019s able to reinforce or counteract it. Only then would you be able to cook a delicacy that\u2019s abundant in spirit energy with varying effects.\u201cThis instead records various spirit flames of different attributes from the first-grade to the fifth-grade. According to the different ingredients, the spirit flames required during cooking are different. Only like this would you be able to allow your dishes to attain the most superb effects.\u201d\u2026After Chen Xi returned home, he was called over by Bai Wanqing and she carefully explained the skills a spirit chef had to master. Thus it could be seen how much she cared about Chen Xi\u2019s affairs.Chen Xi naturally wouldn\u2019t refuse Bai Wanqing\u2019s good intentions, and he listened respectfully with a meticulously attentive expression.\u201cAs for knife skills, you\u2019ve already passed old man Ma\u2019s test, you\u2019ll just have to follow him and practice.\u201d Bai Wanqing smiled happily as she finished speaking, then asked. \u201cDo you have any other questions?\u201dChen Xi pondered for a moment then asked. \u201cYesterday at Clear Stream Restaurant, I heard that old man Ma and the other two are all 3 leaf spirit chefs. Could it be that the profession of spirit chefs is divided into different grades?\u201dBai Wanqing replied. \u201cOf course. After all is said and done, a spirit chef provides services to cultivators, and the dishes that are cooked are according to the cultivators\u2019 realm. The dishes that a 1 leaf spirit chef cooks are extremely beneficial to a Postnatal Realm cultivator. A 2 leaf spirit chef is instead able to cook dishes required by Congenital Realm cultivators. It goes up successively until the 8 leaf spirit chef which is able to cook dishes that are already capable of providing boundless benefits to an Earthly Immortal, and is comparable to a heaven-rank spirit pill!\u201dA trace of shock was unable to be suppressed from emerging within Chen Xi\u2019s heart, according to his knowledge, spirit pills were divided into the heaven-rank, earth-rank, profound-rank, and yellow-rank. Every rank is further divided into the low-grade, intermediate-grade, high-grade, and top-grade. Heaven-rank spirit pills were the rarest, and within the entire Darchu Dynasty, it could be called an existence that was like phoenix feathers and qilin horns.When he heard that an 8 leaf spirit chef was able to cook dishes that were comparable to a heaven-rank spirit pill, how could it not cause Chen Xi to be shocked?\u201cBut, the advancement for a spirit chef is much more difficult compared to an alchemist, Don\u2019t mention 8 leaf spirit chefs, in the entire Darchu Dynasty, there\u2019re only a handful of 7 leaf spirit chefs.\u201dBai Wanqing gazed at Chen Xi as she said with a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t be discouraged, so long as you persist, then you\u2019ll have hope. But a spirit chef is an auxiliary profession after all, so only after you\u2019ve earned sufficient spirit stones, don\u2019t waste too much time on it so as to avoid delaying your cultivation.\u201dChen Xi nodded, he\u2019d learned talisman crafting and the culinary arts all for the sake of allowing his young brother and himself to continue to live. His final goal was still to cultivate more and become even stronger.\u2026In the next few days, Chen Xi continuously cultivated bitterly.He crafted talismans and reviewed and during the day; drew upon the Seventh Goldstar baleful qi to temper his physique at night, then cultivated the Violet Sky Arts until falling asleep before dawn. Only then would he use the little remaining time to enter his sea of consciousness and visualize the Fuxi Divine Statue.Days were passed quickly, to the extent that it could be described as intensely.His nerves felt stiff all the time, as he didn\u2019t dare slack for a moment. Since the day his grandfather Chen Tianli was killed, his head was always filled with a dense sense of danger, urging him to not dare waste even a bit of time.What caused Chen Xi to be happy was that he\u2019d once again crafted another seven or eight types of basic talismans with different attributes. Even though the structure of the talisman markings were completely different to before, its might was comparable to a second-grade talisman. And when he took them to the Zhang general store, they were all sold for three spirit stones each. Its price had hiked an entire nine fold, causing him to earn tremendously.But his advanced in body refinement and qi refinement were still as extremely slow as before, and the fundamental cause of this was the lack of large amounts of spirit energy.The Dao of cultivation stressed upon four words \u2014 wealth, companions, techniques, and location. Wealth was in the first place, but in this case, the wealth wasn\u2019t gold nor silver, but instead spirit stones, spirit pills, immortal herbs, etc. If one wanted to train, then one needed to eat their fill; and if one wanted to cultivate, then one needed to absorb spirit energy. Spirit pills, spirit stones, and similar treasures were an essential form of assistance.Companions were in the second place, it could be a Dao companion,[1. A more advanced form of girlfriend/wife, where they are partners on the journey of cultivation.] but mostly it was the relationship between master and disciple. With the guidance of one\u2019s master, one could reduce the amount of detours taken during cultivation, and it was far more efficient than fumbling by one\u2019s self.The so-called techniques were the Divine Abilities, Techniques, and cultivation methods. First rate cultivation methods were not only able to shorten time cultivation time, but to a great degree they were also able to prevent one from sinking into a bottleneck and suffering from qi deviation.Location instead pointed toward some so-called Blessed Immortal Grounds, and places where sects were established were situated at places where spirit energy gathered. Cultivation there was naturally much better than those mountains that had scarce spirit energy.Those that are really born in famous sects and great clans might have started cultivating since they were young. They ate rare and treasured spirit pills, cultivated first-rate methods, occupied blessed grounds where spirit veins gathered, and even had seniors from their sect or clan to earnestly and tirelessly guide them. Their cultivation speed was absolutely not something ordinary cultivators could compare to.Chen Xi didn\u2019t have spirit pills, nor did he have blessed grounds available for him to cultivate in, nor a senior that was available to guide him. Among the four words of wealth, companions, techniques, and location, he only occupied the word of techniques. Every day, he still had to craft talismans to earn spirit stones to maintain his livelihood, so how could his cultivation possibly advance by leaps and bounds?\u201cI must make old man Ma take me as his disciple today. After I become a spirit chef apprentice at the Clear Stream Restaurant, I\u2019ll surely be able to earn even more spirit stones. If I calculate carefully and meticulously, I\u2019ll be completely able to buy myself some spirit pills that\u2019re required for cultivating!\u201dChen Xi silently recalled the and in his mind, and he only stood up and walked out of the house when he ensured that he didn\u2019t have a trace of omission.\u201cLet\u2019s go, future great spirit chef.\u201d Outside the door, Bai Wanqing had a brilliant smile. She had been waiting for quite some time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The corners of Qiao Nan\u2019s lips beamed as he grinned and whistled vibrantly. \u201cPretty Lady Bai, not seeing you for 10 days is like 10 years. I missed you extremely. Have you been well?\u201dPei Pei instead held her coquettish face with her hands as she gazed at Chen Xi in infatuation and muttered. \u201cMmm, Little Brother Chen Xi seems to have become even more handsome, so manly. Oh!\u201dOld man Ma struck the iron ladle in his hand to make banging sounds, and his voice was like thunder as he stomped his foot and roared. \u201cAs my fucking Junior Brother and Junior Sister, you two are actually so shameless. Fucking shut your mouths!\u201dQiao Nan and Pei Pei pursed their lips, incomparably resentful.Chen Xi had experienced such a scene long ago, so he didn\u2019t feel surprised and only was slightly unable to endure the delicate and charming woman, Pei Pei. He said in his heart,\u201cI presume you\u2019ve already learned the and like the back of your hands in this 10 days of time. I\u2019ll give you a question, and if you can answer it then I\u2019ll take you as my disciple. If you\u2019re unable to answer it, then hurry up and leave so as to avoid wasting each other\u2019s time.\u201d Old man Ma\u2019s expression went serious and he started testing what Chen Xi learned in these 10 days.Chen Xi nodded with a calm expression.In these past ten days, his soul had become many time stronger than before from visualizing the Fuxi Divine Statue. It was precisely because of this that he was able to learn by heart the knowledge that was as vast as the sea within the and in such a short amount of time.Chen Xi was confident that so long as the question was from within those two books, he would surely not make a mistake in the slightest!The question old man Ma produced only consisted of two words \u2014 Rainbow Spindrift! This was the name of a dish that only a 5 leaf spirit chef was able to cook because the ingredients and spirit flame used all contained extremely particular requirements and it had an extremely high difficulty. This dish was also specially prepared for Golden Core Realm cultivators.However, within the , the ranking of Rainbow Spindrift amongst the myriad of dishes wasn\u2019t high. When compared to the other dishes that were available to Golden Core Realm cultivators for consumption, the Rainbow Spindrift was undoubtedly one of the most troublesome dishes to be prepared. Solely the various ingredients of different attributes that were used included more than 100 types, and the steps to cook it even reached of a thousand. Unless it was of necessity, a 5 leaf spirit chef would be unwilling to cook this dish. Thus naturally, very few people showed any interest towards the name, Rainbow Spindrift.As far as old man Ma was concerned, if Chen Xi truly completely mastered the , then using Rainbow Spindrift to test him was extremely suitable.\u201cIn those days amongst the three of us, only I remembered this dish. Even if he\u2019s any more intelligent, it would still be impossible for him to compare to me, and he would only be able to barely compare with you and Junior Sister. Senior Brother, aren\u2019t you making things too difficult for him?\u201d Qiao Nan respectfully protested for Chen Xi, but his words were filled with self-praise. Obviously, this fellow was extremely vain no matter what.\u201cYeah, Senior Brother, you wouldn\u2019t be envious of Little Brother Chen Xi\u2019s appearance being more handsome than yours right? And you\u2019re not using a different method to send him packing, right? I won\u2019t agree to it.\u201d Pei Pei rolled her eyes and started using her own methods to protest for Chen Xi.The veins on old man Ma\u2019s forehead popped up as he gnashed his teeth and barked. \u201cSHUT UP! You\u2019re a narcissist and you\u2019re a boy crazy ditz! What qualifications do the two of you have to fucking challenge me? I\u2019m the fucking Senior Brother, my say is fucking final!\u201dQiao Nan and Pei Pei went silent once again, with an appearance of helplessness from surrendering to despotic power.\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem, right?\u201d Although Bai Wanqing didn\u2019t know the difficulty of the Rainbow Spindrift, but from the behaviour of Qiao Nan and Pei Pei, she could roughly guess its difficulty.She couldn\u2019t help but have a worried expression as she gazed at Chen Xi, and she was extremely suspicious in her heart.Chen Xi nodded towards Bai Wanqing, he was perfectly composed and practically didn\u2019t hesitate before saying, \u201cThe Rainbow Spindrift is made from the Azure Spiral Root, Inky Laurel Flower, Violet Vine Nine Leaf Fruit, Dragon Feeler Poria Branch\u2026\u201dChen Xi recited with a voice that brought along a trace of a unique serene force, as it resounded out into the ears of everyone present in an orderly way.\u201cThese 100 ingredients have attributes that include the five elements, Yin, and Yang. All of them require being sliced into threads that attain the state of being fine like cotton fibres, and this constitutes the first step. The second step is to use 10,000 Year Stalactite Milk as a pool, then sort these ingredients into different attributes before soaking them and cultivating them in the pool. Up to the point the threads are smooth as water and flexible like tendons, then use Azurewood Spirit Flame, Tenthwater Spirit Flame, Crimsonfire Spirit Flame\u2026\u201dIn next to no time, Chen Xi had already had spoken of nearly 100 ingredients of various attributes, then started talking about the handling of the ingredients. Bai Wanqing didn\u2019t understand these, but she clearly saw that along with names of ingredients floating out of Chen Xi\u2019s mouth one by one, the expressions on old man Ma and the others gradually became serious and their eyes vaguely revealed a trace of astonishment.She couldn\u2019t help but secretly heave a sigh of relief, and a strand of a sense of pride arose within her heart as she anticipated Chen Xi\u2019s performance even more.\u201cOh, this kid\u2019s memory isn\u2019t bad. He\u2019ll soon catch up with me during that year.\u201d Qiao Nan was startled as he spoke with a tone that had a trace of unnaturalness.\u201cIt can\u2019t be! You\u2019re still vain even now? I remember that although you remembered all the steps of the Rainbow Spindrift that year, you also had over ten omissions. Little Brother Chen Xi hasn\u2019t had a trace of mistake up until now.\u201d Pei Pei exposed him relentlessly.Embarrassment flashed on Qiao Nan\u2019s face, then his face went sombre. \u201cActually, I could have achieved perfection that time, but it\u2019s all because I was too kind hearted and couldn\u2019t bear to cause you and Senior Brother to lose face. So, I intentionally\u2026\u201d\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d Old man Ma\u2019s suppressed his voice and interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m fucking taking a disciple, not listening to you blow your own trumpet!\u201dQiao Nan lightly sighed, then unhurriedly stroked his chin. He had a bleak and desolate expression from not being understood, but in his heart he was instead burning with impatience. He was flustered and exasperated as he nagged. \u201cKid, hurry up and make a mistake. Otherwise, my stalwart and talented image will be completely destroyed. How would I strike up a conversation with beauties in the future\u2026?\u201dHowever, what caused Qiao Nan to despair was that fifteen minutes had passed, but Chen Xi still didn\u2019t have a single omission. On the contrary, his thoughts became clearer and clearer, his speed of speaking faster and faster, simply able to be said that his mouth was like a rushing river that was pouring out like a flood.Qiao Nan was battered out of his senses. \u201cIt\u2019s over, this genius\u2019 record from that year has been broken\u2026\u201dPei Pei muttered in infatuation. \u201cA confident man is the most handsome. Mmm, Big Sister has been captured and is stuck in the snares of love, and I\u2019m unable to free myself.\u201dBai Wanqing was radiant, and she ceaselessly repeated. \u201cNot bad, not bad\u2026\u201dOld man Ma\u2019s shrivelled and stiff face had already bloomed into a smile, like a daisy that bloomed vigorously after autumn.\u2026\u201cIn conclusion, so long as these different ingredients are handled according to these steps that I\u2019ve mentioned, it\u2019s completely able to form a unique exterior of spindrifts gathering to make a rainbow manifest, after baking it with Spirit Gathering Yin Flame.\u201dAfter the time for an incense stick to burn, Chen Xi finally completely explained all the steps of the Rainbow Spindrift. When raised his eyes to look, he instead noticed the surrounding people were all dumbstruck with absent-minded appearances, and he couldn\u2019t help but be slightly startled as he thought to himself.He didn\u2019t know how great of a shock that these two hours of him explaining without the slightest mistake brought to the others, but he was extremely clear that today was the time he spoke the most, and it was practically worth the amount he spoke in a year.\u201cCough. Mmm, being able to achieve such a degree in 10 days, your natural talent is alright.\u201d After a long time, old man Ma coughed dryly to break the silence.Chen Xi let out a sigh of relief, it was alright as long as he passed the test. As for how his natural talent was, he didn\u2019t care to fuss about it.\u201cWhat do you mean by natural talent is alright?\u201d Qiao Nan was as if been provoked, and he didn\u2019t have a trace of poise anymore. He waved his arms about like he was in a frenzy as he roared. \u201cHow can a fellow that is a bigger genius than this genius be called as alright natural talent? Then what about me? Trash with stupid natural talent?\u201dPei Pei was unable to bear with old man Ma\u2019s evaluation as well, and she spoke with extremely sharp words. \u201cSenior Brother, when you explained the Rainbow Spindrift to Master all those years ago, you were oppressed to the point your face flushed red. You hummed and hawed for more than half a day, and even got a more than half of it wrong, you\u2026\u201dOld man Ma was embarrassed to the point he become incomparably furious when his old scars were exposed in his face, and he roared to interrupt Pei Pei at once. \u201cIs it not enough that I fucking admit he\u2019s a genius? Would the two of you die if you shut your mouths and be silent!?\u201dOld man Ma stopped for a moment, then said weakly, \u201cActually, I was afraid he would be arrogant, so I merely struck a small blow to his confidence.\u201dQiao Nan and Pei Pei rolled their eyes in unison.Chen Xi was confused by this, he extremely lacked the awareness of the importance of becoming a genius, and he only muttered in his heart.Bai Wanqing pulled on the corner of Chen Xi\u2019s sleeve and said softly. \u201cDid you know earlier that old man Ma was going to test this Rainbow Spindrift?\u201dChen Xi was startled then shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201dBai Wanqing said in amazement, \u201cThat is to say you\u2019ve completely mastered the and theChen Xi was bewildered. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201dHe was indeed extremely bewildered, as far as he was concerned, wasn\u2019t it just memorizing some words, what was so worthy of being surprised of?Bai Wanqing was finally convinced from Chen Xi\u2019s tone. This fellow had indeed completely memorized the two books, and she couldn\u2019t help but have a trace of inexplicable shock arise within her.She\u2019d once glanced through the and there was a few tens of thousands of ingredients. Wanting to remember by heart all the names, attributes, appearances, affects, growth environments, etc., of these tens of thousands of ingredients wasn\u2019t something that was able to be done in a short amount of time. Whereas Chen Xi had instead memorized all of them within 10 days. How could it not shock others?But this wasn\u2019t important, as if it was another fellow with shocking memory, so long as the fellow was willing to spend the time, then the fellow would similarly be able to do this. What was important was Chen Xi had not only remembered these ingredients, but was also able to master in detail the dishes that could be cooked with these ingredients and every step during the cooking process without mistake. This was what caused others to feel shocked the most.Of course, if Chen Xi was a Violet Palace Realm cultivator who had condensed Perception Force, he would naturally be able to memorize everything within 10 days. But the facts were that Chen Xi merely possessed the cultivation of the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm and it had long since been seen through by old man Ma and the others. Thus, it was completely impossible for them to regard him as a Violet Palace Realm cultivator.It was precisely because of this reason that old man Ma and the others felt incomparably shocked and regarded Chen Xi as an extraordinary and intelligent genius.Bai Wanqing had figured out all this now, and besides being shocked, she couldn\u2019t help but feel proud and happy for Chen Xi.She knew how much suffering the youth before her had suffered since a young age, and what sort of painful hardships he\u2019d experienced. Now that it was like he was reborn and started to emit the radiance that belonged to him, how could it not cause her to be happy?\u201cOld man Ma, since you\u2019ve recruited a disciple, then sign an agreement with me.\u201d Right at that moment, a voice that was as chilly as ice faintly sounded out from outside, and accompanied by this voice, the door was pushed open. An extremely beautiful young girl walked in with a proud and aloof, yet icy cold expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - Du QingxiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18 - Du QingxiAlong with the entrance of this young girl, the room suddenly went silent, and even narcissistic Qiao Nan and the boy crazy Pei Pei self-consciously shut their mouths.Chen Xi looked up and a woman in a black dress with a tall and well-proportioned figure entered his eyes. The woman was as pretty as a picture; she had a fine nose and cherry lips with skin that was white as snow. Looking from afar, she seemed like a proud and aloof black peony that was in full bloom, revealing a unique icy cold feeling.\u201cShe\u2019s Du Qingxi[1. Her name (\u675c\u6e05\u6eaa) forms part of the name of the restaurant (\u6e05\u6eaa\u9152\u697c), but I prefer translating her name when used in the restaurant than calling it Qingxi Restaurant], the owner of Clear Stream Restaurant. She usually lives in seclusion and is rarely seen, as she\u2019s in closed door cultivation most of the time and extremely rarely comes within the restaurant. Her origins are rather mysterious and no one knows of her strength. Supposedly even General Qin of the General\u2019s Estate has to be courteous to her.\u201d Bai Wanqing\u2019s voice that was gentle and pleasing silently pierced into Chen Xi\u2019s ears, and only then did he understand the identity of the woman before him. Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be slightly astonished, the ability of this woman was indeed extremely astonishing, as she was able to control the number one restaurant in Pine Mist City at such a young age.After Du Qingxi walked in, she directly ignored everyone else and only covertly glanced at Chen Xi before directing her gaze at old man Ma as she directly said, \u201cThe disciple you\u2019ve recruited will be provided with 100 spirit stones a day, and the materials needed for practicing his culinary arts will be provided for free. But he must sign a three year agreement with me and guarantee to only work in my Clear Stream Restaurant within the next three years. How about it?\u201d Her voice was frosty, and it revealed a sense of being unquestionable.Old man Ma shook his head. \u201cI only pass down culinary arts, you have to discuss these things with that kid.\u201dDu Qingxi\u2019s beautiful brows frowned as she looked at Chen Xi and slowly said, \u201cYou\u2019ve heard my conditions clearly, to sign or not to sign the agreement is all up to you.\u201dTruthfully speaking, these conditions had already exceeded Chen Xi\u2019s expectations, as he originally thought that being able to earn a few tens of spirit stones would already be a blessing. Never had he imagined that Du Qingxi would directly give him a remuneration of 100 spirit stones, and at the same moment that he was stunned, he couldn\u2019t help but feel extremely pleasantly surprised.Chen Xi silently pondered for a moment before making his decision and replying. \u201cI can agree to only working at Clear Stream Restaurant, but I\u2019m unable to guarantee the time. However, what I can assure you is that as long as I\u2019m within Pine Mist City, I will not work in another restaurant.\u201dHe did this to be prepared for any contingencies, as he was burdened with too many things and was utterly unable to guarantee if he would be able to be a spirit chef apprentice for three years in Clear Stream Restaurant.Du Qingxi was startled, seeming to have never expected that Chen Xi would dare to negotiate with her, and she coldly nodded after some time. \u201cI hope you can abide by your promise.\u201dShe turned around and left after she finished. Her actions were decisive, without the slightest hesitation.It had only been a short while since the moment Du Qingxi entered and left the room, but the grandness of her presence and the decisiveness of her words were expressed vividly. Coupled with her extremely beautiful icy cold appearance that was proud and aloof, she was like a queen that stood above the masses as she inspected her territory, causing one to unconsciously feel reverence.But all this had very little effect on Chen Xi, as he only knew that he\u2019d already become a spirit chef apprentice that had a remuneration of over 100 spirit stones a day. So, his mood was extremely happy and he completely didn\u2019t mind how dominating Du Qingxi\u2019s attitude was.\u2026\u201cMiss, we\u2019ve already finished investigating, this is the detailed information on Chen Xi.\u201d Wu Feng had a respectful expression and passed over a piece of paper.Wu Feng\u2019s face was fair and clear, with a feminine disposition. When Du Qingxi was born, he was arranged to be like a shadow guarding by her side.\u201cChen Xi, originally the eldest grandson of the eldest son of Pine Mist City\u2019s Chen Clan\u2026\u201dThe paper recorded everything about Chen Xi in detail; all the things that had happened since he was born until now all appeared on the thin piece of paper.After Du Qingxi finished reading, a trace of rare surprise appeared within her chilly starry eyes. \u201cClan annihilated, parents separated, marriage contract torn to shreds, grandfather killed\u2026 This fellow is really misfortunate, no wonder others call him a jinx.\u201dWu Feng frowned. \u201cMiss, you wouldn\u2019t be feeling pity for him so you gave him such generous conditions, right? Those ingredients are all things that are filled with spirit energy, just allowing him to waste it like this, seems\u2026 slightly improper, right?\u201dDu Qingxi said indifferently, \u201cSo long as he\u2019s able to learn 10% of old man Ma\u2019s culinary arts before the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials, so what if he wastes some materials?\u201dWu Feng seemed to have realized something as he exclaimed in shock. \u201cMiss, could it be that you really want to head to the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain?\u201dDu Qingxi said indifferently, \u201cExactly, I\u2019ve already obtained an Essence Seal Pill, so reducing my cultivation to the Congenital Realm isn\u2019t a problem. But you know as well, the spirit energy in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain is exhausted, and baleful qi billows. If I\u2019m not accompanied by a spirit chef, then bitterly spending three years there will only lead to death.\u201dWu Feng was astounded. \u201cHow could it be three years? Normally when the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain opens, it would close within three months. Could it be that there\u2019s some unforeseen event this time?\u201dDu Qingxi coldly glanced at Wu Feng, then said after a long time. \u201cThese thing were told to me by my father. Are you sure you want to know?\u201dWu Feng seemed to have thought of something terrifying as he fiercely shuddered, then hurriedly shook his head. \u201cThis subordinate is only worried about Miss\u2019 safety, and has absolutely no intention of offence.\u201dDu Qingxi waved her hand and instructed. \u201cYou stand down first. Remember, don\u2019t spread the matter of Chen Xi practicing culinary arts in Clear Stream Restaurant. Although the Li Clan is small, the shadow of the Su Clan lurks behind it. It\u2019s better to not have a dispute with them.\u201dWu Feng respectfully complied, then his body swayed before transforming into a faintly discernible black smoke that disappeared.\u2026Not long after Du Qingxi left, Bai Wanqing bid her farewell and left as well. As for Qiao Nan and Pei Pei, old man Ma directly waved the iron ladle about to drive them out of the room, only leaving him and Chen Xi behind.Old man Ma didn\u2019t like talking nonsense, and he had utterly no intention of having a conversation with Chen Xi as he started passing down his culinary arts right away.Before he started teaching, wooden puppets held trays that were like flowing water and placed them before Chen Xi. Within every tray was many types of various ingredients that hadn\u2019t been cleaned and cut, and spirit energy suffused out, causing it to be extremely conspicuous.Chen Xi roughly counted, and he couldn\u2019t help be startled by the entire 100 plus trays that contained over a thousand ingredients.\u201cThese 1308 types of ingredients contain fruits, vegetables, grains, demon beast flesh\u2026 They\u2019re the most basic ingredients, and are also called low-grade ingredients. So long as you\u2019re able to cook various different dishes with these ingredients and its effects are able to be enjoyed by Postnatal Realm cultivators, then you\u2019ll be considered as having learned the basics.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll demonstrate the method of cooking 13 dishes now. Within these 13 dishes, each of them places particular emphasis on various things such as knife skill, spirit flames and pairing of the five elements. Pay attention and learn.\u201d Old man Ma was brimming with energy and vitality as he explained a great many things while his spittle scattered about, then he arrived before the stove and casually grabbed a few ingredients and started personally instructing.\u201cThis dish is called Fragrant Chili Braised Crimson-Horn Prawn. The Crimson-Horn Prawns are 0.33m long and live on the bank of spirit lakes. They\u2019re of cold-yin attribute with a fresh and tender texture. It must be cooked with fiery-yang attribute shellfish with a piercingly hot taste as supplementary ingredients. Then further supplement it with Kyllinga Herb, Azure Haired Wild Boar Lard, Emerald Crystal Salt, etc. Then, use Blazing Yang Flame\u2026\u201d As he spoke, old man Ma\u2019s hands weren\u2019t idle, as they first cleaned and cut the materials, then controlled the spirit flame. Once the flames heated up, he put in the seasonings, then held the ladle and lifted up the wok before swiftly stirring with smooth and swift movements that seemed extremely free and easy.Chen Xi devoted his heart and soul as he stared unblinkingly at old man Ma.Five years spent doing talisman crafting caused him to develop an extremely good habit, and that was no matter what he did, so long as he wanted to do it, he would be able to put his heart and soul into it in an extremely short amount of time.These 10 days, Chen Xi had visualized the Fuxi Divine Statue without slacking in the slightest. The strength of his soul was advancing by leaps and bounds with a shocking speed, and it had already faintly arrived at the verge of breakthrough.At this moment, he had only just gathered his condition when his mind instantly entered a clear and nimble state. The movements of old man Ma became slow in his eyes, every movement and every step was seen by him perfectly, then memorized in his heart.Sizzle!Strands of striking fragrance that suffocated the nose with a pungent smell drifted out in the entire room.Not long after, a Crimson-Horn Prawn that was red as fire occupied the pure white jade tray, and traces of glossy and boiling sauce hissed on the surface of the Crimson-Horn Prawn as it emitted a pungent fragrance that caused one to drool.\u201cTry it, if you can\u2019t prepare it to attain this taste in the future, then don\u2019t tell anyone that you\u2019re my disciple!\u201d Old man Ma was brimming with energy and vigor, and he revealed a sense of proudness, as he was obviously extremely confident of his skill.Chen Xi gulped down a mouthful of saliva with difficulty before picking up the chopsticks and lightly touching the prawn\u2019s shell. The Crimson-Horn Prawn split open neatly from the middle, revealing the snow white and translucent flesh within, and the fragrance it emitted became even more dense and enticing. The tip of his chopstick lightly flicked as he picked up a piece of prawn flesh that emitted steam, then placed it into his mouth.The moment the prawn flesh touched his tongue, a unique fresh and hot feeling instantly covered his entire body. Chen Xi felt his tongue lightly tremble as if shocked by electricity, and his mouth was filled with a numbing tender and smooth feeling, causing him to be unable to help from lightly chewing. The prawn flesh was smooth and supple, with a pungent and refreshing taste, and was extremely delicious.\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Old man Ma crossed his arms before him, and had an appearance that was brimming with confidence.Chen Xi mumbled. \u201cLet me eat another mouthful.\u201dAs he spoke, he once again waved his chopsticks, and they swiftly swooped down like rain drops. He didn\u2019t have the usual sedate and calm appearance, and was instead like a reincarnated hungry ghost as he gobbled down. In the blink of an eye, he\u2019d already cleanly annihilated the entire Crimson-Horn Prawn.It wasn\u2019t Chen Xi\u2019s fault that he forgot himself like this, as this Crimson-Horn Prawn was really too delicious. To him who had only eaten white rice and salted vegetables for the past ten years, the Crimson-Horn Prawn was no different from a supreme delicacy that was rare in the world, causing him to be unable to stop even though he wanted to.Most importantly, after he ate the Crimson-Horn Prawn, he clearly perceived a burst of rich spirit energy gush into his Dantian like a stream, actually causing his cultivation to instantly explosively increase by a shred!Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help be sigh extremely emotionally,Old man Ma was extremely satisfied with Chen Xi\u2019s behaviour, as actions always spoke louder than words, and Chen Xi gulping down the dish earlier was undoubtedly the highest praise to his culinary arts. But he still said in contempt. \u201cKid, this is only a dish prepared for Postnatal Realm cultivators, can you be a little more mature?\u201dChen Xi went silent, but he was incomparably ashamed in his heart, he had indeed forgotten himself earlier\u2026\u201cTo a qualified spirit chef, delicious delicacies are a Great Dao that\u2019s able to cause tongues to be unbound, and allow life and cultivation to be rich and brilliant. It\u2019s the final destination that every spirit chef seeks and climbs towards their entire lifetime. Kid, it isn\u2019t such a simple matter to become a qualified spirit chef.\u201d Old man Ma\u2019s expression suddenly became incomparably solemn, and his eyes revealed boundless fanaticism and staunchness.Chen Xi was incomparably dazed, and he was unconsciously filled with anticipation towards his future life!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - Quiet RoomPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19 - Quiet Room\u201cEight Treasures Fragrant Rice, Stewed Coiling Dragon in Brown Sauce, Dry-fried Inksoul Scorpion, Mixed Stew Azure Silkie...\u201dOld man Ma\u2019s culinary arts had indeed attained an extraordinary level; in less than an hour, he had once again cooked another 13 extremely delicious delicacies.Chen Xi felt extreme happiness, happiness that he had never felt since he was a child. Dish after dish of delicious delicacies that he\u2019d never tasted in his life; they not only caused his six senses to obtain extreme satisfaction, but the pure and thick spirit energy that was contained within the dishes were like rainfall after a drought as they gathered within his Dantian, actually gradually condensing into the fourth True Essence violet cloud in an extremely short amount of time!With every increase in one\u2019s level of the Congenital Realm, a cloud condensed from True Essence would appear within the Dantian, and it was called the cloud stairway of foundation building. It continued until nine clouds were formed, then one could develop the Violet Palace to become a Violet Palace Realm cultivator that possessed the Dao foundation to formally step into the palace of immortals.Chen Xi had already stagnated at the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm for five years, and it wasn\u2019t because of his natural talent being too inferior, but instead because of that longevity lock his mother left behind. During these five years, it had silently absorbed the True Essence within his body, and only when the longevity lock shattered to reveal the jade pendant within did he seem as if he had broken his shackles. From that day onwards, he never worried about his cultivation being unable to advance.However, even then, under the circumstances of lacking the support of spirit stones, spirit pills, spirit medicine, and other external sources of support, the advancement of his cultivation was extremely slow. He had never imagined that eating over 10 dishes actually allowed his cultivation to be like an oil well blowout and break through a level once again. This naturally caused him to be incomparably pleasantly surprised.However, following the happiness, he also felt a type a torture. Every time old man Ma cooked a delicious dish, that pungent enticing smell caused him to be unable to stop even though he wanted to, and his original intention of having only a tiny bite turned completely into disregarding his image as he gobbled down the dishes. This caused him to feel more and more ashamed, and he felt himself to be a bigger and bigger glutton that was unable to resist temptation.Old man Ma was startled by Chen Xi\u2019s appearance when eating as well, as he gazed at those 14 empty jade plates, he simple didn\u2019t dare believe his eyes, and only muttered in an absent-minded state. \u201cFreak! Could it be that this fellow\u2019s stomach is a bottomless pit? The disciple I fucking took is too\u2026weird, right?\u201dChen Xi felt even more ashamed in his heart when he heard this, and his deadpan face that was ridiculed for being expressionless even revealed a rare trace of a blush.He felt it to be extremely strange as well, after completely clearing 14 dishes, not only did he not feel bloated, but instead he had the urge of wanting to eat a large pile of food.\u201cYou freak, simply behaving exactly like those body refiner coolies[1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolie], a complete glutton!\u201d Old man Ma muttered once more.However when these words entered Chen Xi\u2019s ears, it instead caused a problem to cross his mind, it seemed\u2026 Since he cultivated the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts, he\u2019d never felt full. Could this be the reason why?Chen Xi carefully sensed the changes in his body. He felt as if his flesh, blood, and skin were filled with boundless vigor. Even his bones seemed to have become 100g lighter, and his entire body surged with copious amounts of thick strength.At this moment, he completely understood that these dishes that were rich in spirit qi were not only useful to qi refiners, but were able to give rise to extremely good nourishment effects for the body of body refiners!Old man Ma seemed to be moved by his conscience when he saw Chen Xi muddle-headed and not speaking, and he didn\u2019t mutter words that caused Chen Xi to be extremely embarrassed anymore as he directly asked. \u201cAmong the 14 cooking methods, how many have you remembered?\u201dSpeaking of proper business caused Chen Xi\u2019s expression to finally return to normal, then he pondered and said, \u201cI\u2019ve almost memorized them all.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Old man Ma\u2019s eyes abruptly sprang wide open.Chen Xi thought for a moment, then seriously nodded.Yet Old man Ma didn\u2019t believe him and pointed towards the stove. \u201cYou go cook. Hmm, cook the Dry-fried Inksoul Scorpion.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Chen Xi replied straightforwardly, and his actions were extremely decisive. He arrived before the stove, then followed according to the memories in his mind to start cooking step by step.Cleaning and cutting the Inksoul Scorpion, blending the seasonings, controlling spirit flames\u2026Old man Ma gazed at Chen Xi\u2019s methodical cooking method, and his expression that was originally doubtful slowly became astonished and astounded. \u00a0Until he saw Chen Xi using True Essence to absorb the iron ladle onto his hand, then controlling the iron lady and iron wok with precise and balanced strength, his gaze completely transformed into shock.The steps weren\u2019t different in the slightest!Old man Ma couldn\u2019t help but secretly say in his heart,His heart suddenly became excited when he thought up to here.After the time for an incense stick to burn, a plate of Dry-fried Inksoul Scorpion with the mouth-watering texture of crispy meat came out of the wok.Old man Ma rushed forward impatiently, then picked up a mellow Inksoul Scorpion and stuffed it into his mouth. He fell into a trance after slowly chewing for a moment, this taste and degree of purity of spirit energy\u2026 It was equal to what he\u2019d cooked!Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be slightly perturbed, when he was cooking earlier, there were many occasions that he was nearly unable to control the rhythm of the spirit flame. Luckily, his disposition was steady and firm, and he was neither flurried nor disturbed. This allowed him to pull through without mishap and persist till the end.\u201cI intend to change the method of teaching you culinary arts.\u201d After a short while, old man Ma seemed to have given it careful consideration and he slowly said, \u201cSheer imitation poses no difficulty to you. Since that\u2019s the case, start cooking dishes of your own.\u201dChen Xi was startled. \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s extremely simple. Take the most basic 1,308 ingredients and cook dishes of your own according to their attributes.\u201dOld man Ma said indifferently, \u201cSo long as you\u2019re able to allow it to possess both fragrance and taste, and at the same time allow the spirit energy of the dish to attain the optimum degree, you\u2019ll be considered as a true 1 leaf spirit chef!\u201dChen Xi felt it to be slightly inappropriate. \u00a0He\u2019d only just become a spirit chef apprentice and had only memorized two books: and As for culinary arts, he\u2019d merely memorized the steps of cooking 14 types of dishes from imitating another and didn\u2019t have a shred of foundation.Under these circumstances, why would old man Ma put forward such a demand?Chen Xi was extremely uncertain.\u201cJust like the understanding and comprehension of the Dao of the Heavens is different for each cultivator, the culinary arts of each spirit chef is different.\u201dOld man Ma said indifferently, \u201cYour natural talent in the culinary Dao is extremely shocking, instead of following my path, why don\u2019t you search for a path of culinary Dao of your own!?\u201dOld man Ma\u2019s eyes once again emitted a light of fanaticism and longing when he spoke up to this point, then he suddenly turned around to stare fixedly at Chen Xi\u2019s eyes and said in a low voice. \u201cHowever, I\u2019ll test you every now and then, and if you\u2019re unable to pass, then don\u2019t dream of obtaining your salary from Clear Stream Restaurant.\u201dChen Xi was dumbstruck, he suddenly had a feeling of being abandoned, and attached to it was bloody exploitation.\u2026Within the Quiet Room.Chen Xi looked at the various ingredients that were piled into mountains that surrounded him, then looked at the brand-new stove and cooking utensils that were shiny. His gaze was perplexed while his mind was filled with a myriad of thoughts.Only he was here, as according to the intentions of old man Ma, unless he\u2019s able to cook dishes of his own and attain the level of a 1 leaf spirit chef, otherwise, don\u2019t think of walking out of the Quiet Room.Even with his tolerance, Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but feel a burst of annoyance when he recalled what old man Ma said.After feeling annoyed, Chen Xi quickly calmed down, then he looked at everything in his surroundings. He knew that continuing to grumble would be of no use, instead it would be better to think of how to use these ingredients to cook a dish that satisfied old man Ma, then he could leave this damnable Quiet Room.He walked up to the mountainous pile of ingredients and carefully examined them one by one.When Chen Xi became serious, he undoubtedly possessed extremely shocking explosive power. His thoughts revolved in a frenzy as he combined the knowledge he\u2019d learned from the and started to reorganize the mountainous pile of various ingredients.After the time for an incense stick to burn.All the ingredients were organized into two large piles, respectively representing the attributes of Yin and Yang. Every large pile was further divided into five small portions that represented the five elemental attributed of metal, wood, water, earth, and fire. Every ingredient of similar elemental attributes were further divided into several parts that were even smaller by their taste, growth environment, main material, supplementary material, etc.This process consumed nearly a day of his time, and for the sake of insuring there were no errors, he didn\u2019t even hesitate to taste demon beast blood that assailed his nose with a bloody smell and ingredients in fluid form that had extremely disgusting colors. \u00a0His tongue was nearly tortured to numbness from being stimulated by these various strange ingredients, and there were even many times that he nearly vomited from disgust.However, when he saw the various ingredients appear before him in order, Chen Xi felt a trace of gratification, and he didn\u2019t care to wipe the sweat off his forehead before starting to compute a method of creating a new dish.Time trickled by. Chen Xi stood up after a long time, then he picked over ten ingredients before directly arriving at the stove.Sizzle!After preparing the ingredients and seasonings, Chen Xi didn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest as he started cooking, however it wasn\u2019t even 15 minutes when a burnt smell was emitted from the bottom of the wok.He\u2019d long since been prepared to fail, so he wasn\u2019t surprised when he saw this. He placed the dish onto the jade plate then ate it bite by bite.The taste was extremely strange, but Chen Xi seemed to not notice in the slightest as he chewed with an absent-minded expression, his mind was fully involved in analyzing the reason for failure.After finishing and clearing up, Chen Xi started cooking once again.Five elements were uneven, FAILURE!Mistake in seasoning, FAILURE!Ingredients prepared improperly, FAILURE!Overly excessive cooking technique, True Essence dissipating, FAILURE!\u2026After successively failing over ten times, Chen Xi had already become completely senseless, as he gulped down his failed dishes bite by bite, then calmly analysed the reason for each failure before starting anew. That sedate and stiff face was expressionless, and he was like a machine that knew no exhaustion as he monotonously repeated the same actions.Chen Xi completely didn\u2019t notice that not only did his spirit energy not get depleted, but instead was like a pool of water beneath a rainstorm, growing at a noticeable speed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - The WimpPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20 - The WimpThe sky had only just brightened when Imp yawned before waking up with a drowsy look.He used to be a hooligan on the streets. Though he was young, he was extremely intelligent. Boss Zhang of the Zhang general goods store took a fancy to him one month ago, and he was fortunate to become a talisman crafting apprentice that received a salary.However, for the past month, he instead helped Zhang Dayong do something else: he served as a sales assistant.The store\u2019s door swung open, revealing a dense crowd that had long since gathered outside the door, to the point that even a drop of water couldn\u2019t leak out.\u201cIt\u2019s open! Brother Imp, I want to order three Driller talismans, I want those new-version talismans!\u201d\u201cWimp, I\u2019m your neighbour, Uncle Li. Do you still have any more of those basic Azurewood talismans that have a might comparable to a second-grade talisman?\u201d\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t vie for it with me. I\u2019ve already lined up for three days just to buy a Goldedge talisman for that brat of mine at home to defend himself. I\u2019ll get furious with anyone who vies against me!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the instructor of Pine Mist City\u2019s Heavenly Maple Talisman Crafting Institution. I\u2019ve come here this time to meet the Grandmaster that developed the new version of these basic talismans. I wonder if Brother Imp can introduce us?\u201d\u2026Everyone clamored as they fought their way to crowd towards the door without a care for their image, as if they were fighting for goods in the market.Imp had become used to this, as since the new version Earthshield Talisman that Chen Xi crafted circulated half a month ago, the reputation of the Zhang General Store boomed overnight.Boss Zhang Dayong seized this opportunity to put out an announcement that shocked one\u2019s eyeballs out of their sockets \u2014Grandmaster Level Talisman Crafting Master\u2019s Personal Works,Our Store\u2019s Grand Contribution This Year,The Shocking Appearance of New Version Basic Talismans Made with Exquisite Skill.You! Deserve to Own One!The announcement was extremely shocking and did indeed attract much attention, but they were basic talismans after all, and most people were still slightly doubtful of the genuineness of the news.But when Zhang Dayong revealed by accident that the Little Princess of the General\u2019s Estate had already purchased 15 new version Earthshield talismans, the door of the Zhang General Store was instantly crowded explosively.Who within Pine Mist City didn\u2019t know that the Little Princess of the General\u2019s Estate was a little talisman addict? How could something that could arouse her fancy be mistaken?Zhang Dayong was bursting with joy, he who had planned this beforehand had already predicted this situation when he saw Chen Xi continuously crafting various basic talismans that had entirely different structures. However, there were only a few types of new version talismans that Chen Xi had crafted and their quantity was extremely limited. For the sake of fully utilizing these precious resources, he resolutely decided to only sell 10 of these new-version talismans daily.Things are valued by rarity, the rarer it is, the more valuable it is!Zhang Dayong, who\u2019d been doing business for 30 years, naturally knew of this principle, and for the sake of not receiving demands by acquaintances and influential people, he even went to the extent of hiding early on and entrusting Imp to handle everything.\u201cEveryone, look at the plate number in your hands, numbers that I call upon may enter the store, numbers that I don\u2019t can return tomorrow.\u201d Imp roared out loudly. \u201cNumber 155, number 156\u2026\u201dAfter successively calling out 10 numbers, those that were called upon had joyous and complacent expressions, while those that weren\u2019t called upon started clamoring in indignation. Some begged, some tried to exploit their connections, some used threats\u2026 Living examples showed up of all behaviours and expressions present in the world.Imp stiffened his face and remained indifferent with an obstinate expression. In his heart however, he still couldn\u2019t help from feeling dense envy.Imp used to be like the other apprentices, ridiculing Chen Xi as a jinx that had misfortune looming above his head. When had he ever imagined that there would be a day that this jinx would actually be able to cause such a stir?If it wasn\u2019t for Boss Zhang repeatedly making it clear to him that he wasn\u2019t allowed to reveal Chen Xi\u2019s identity, he even thought that solely based on Chen Xi\u2019s ability to craft new version basic talismans, it would be able to cause the entire Pine Mist City to change their impression of Chen Xi!Could it be that this fellow is really going to wash away all his misfortune and leap up to become a famous great figure?Imp secretly decided that he must respect Chen Xi in the future, as if by any chance Chen Xi really rose meteorically; if Chen Xi conveniently gave him some help, wouldn\u2019t he make a killing? However, Chen Xi hadn\u2019t come to the store for over ten days, and if Chen Xi still didn\u2019t turn up, then these new-version basic talismans were going to be out of stock\u2026Pine Mist City\u2019s Commoners District, before Chen Xi\u2019s home.Luo Chong gazed at the young girl in a simple dress that sat on the stone steps while staring blankly and couldn\u2019t help but sigh in his heart. Was there any need for the Little Princess of the General\u2019s Estate to go so far as to wait before that jinx, Chen Xi\u2019s, house for ten days just for the sake of some talismans? No wonder she\u2019s called the Little Talisman Addict.Luo Chong was the number one expert under the command of Pine Mist City\u2019s General\u2019s Estate. He had an unfathomable cultivation, his figure was gaunt with a pair of thin arms and a pair of clear and bright eyes.Yet he was concealed in the shadows now, like a vigilant cheetah, observing the surrounding conditions at every moment.Qin Hongmian was crazy about the Dao of talismans, but didn\u2019t know the ways of the world. She was na\u00efve like an ignorant child, to the point that she came all alone to the Commoners District where crooks were mixed with commoners. It was difficult to ensure that no accidents would happen, so Luo Chong\u2019s assignment was to guard from the shadows and guarantee Qin Hongmian\u2019s safety.I wonder where that jinx went, actually making me and Miss suffer bitterly for over ten days. Truly an unpleasant bastard!Luo Chong criticised endlessly.\u2026Li Clan, Martial Practice Hall.Manager Wu had a respectful expression as he said in a deep voice, \u201cAccording to reliable sources, it\u2019s very likely for the target to leave Clear Stream Restaurant. Li Han, Li Feng, Li Zhan, you three brothers are adept at the art of stealth and assassination. Tonight, the three of you will be the main forces. Be sure to not leave any traces.\u201cYes!\u201d Three young men with deep and vicious expressions agreed in unison.\u201cGood! This battle is related to the honor of our Li Clan. I will personally head over as well, and once you\u2019ve succeeded I\u2019ll suggest to the Patriarch that he allow you three brothers to cultivate in the Ancestral House.\u201d Manager Wu couldn\u2019t help but nod in satisfaction. The cultivations of the three brothers before him were at the 8th level of the Congenital Realm. When they joined forces, they were fully capable of defeating a cultivator who had achieved perfection in the Congenital Realm. Using them to deal with a 3rd level Congenital Realm kid was simply extremely easy!Cultivate in the Ancestral House?The three brothers were all shocked and inexplicable excitement appeared on their faces in unison.Manager Wu couldn\u2019t help but laugh in joy when he saw this, exactly one month later, it was truly like a god sent opportunity. He seemed as if he\u2019d already seen his prey struggling hysterically before his eyes, in a futile effort\u2026Clear Stream Restaurant.The Quiet Room that was shut tightly for half a month was opened from outside. When old man Ma, Qiao Nan, and Pei Pei saw the scene within clearly, they gasped in unison and their expressions instantly froze.The materials that were piled into a hill had disappeared, and only Chen Xi sat all alone with his eyes closed in mediation within the empty room, seeming extremely conspicuous.\u201cCould it be that this fellow ate up all the ingredients?\u201d Qiao Nan seemed as if he\u2019d seen a ghost, and he cried out, \u201cThose ingredients are able to feed ordinary cultivators for 10 years!\u201d\u201cNot only is Little Brother Chen Xi handsome, but even his appetite is so domineering and fierce. Oh! Only such a man is worthy of me to willingly sink into the river of love.\u201d The charming and enchanting Pei Pei once again showed her boy crazy side.Old man Ma had experienced Chen Xi\u2019s gluttonous ability that far surpassed an ordinary person earlier, but now when he saw this scene, he couldn\u2019t help from feeling a chill run down his spine, then he muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve fucking taken a disciple that can be called a rare glutton, I wonder if it\u2019s a blessing or misfortune, he\u2026 he\u2026 How can he eat so much?\u201dPei Pei walked over to the stove and noticed the jade plates of assorted dishes that were spread out in a row, and she hurriedly beckoned as she called out. \u201cSenior Brother! Quickly! Come take a look! These seem to be the dishes that Little Brother Chen Xi cooked.\u201dOld man Ma and Qiao Nan arrived before the stove, their expressions turning serious and solemn as they gazed at the row of dishes with various colors that were pleasant to the eye.\u201cThis Deep-fried Black Eel isn\u2019t bad, the combination of texture is first-rate, and the spirit energy is pure and thick. Pass.\u201d\u201cMmm, this Jadeflame Stewed Crisp Meat\u2019s texture isn\u2019t bad, and every aspect has attained a first-rate standard. Most shocking of all is that he actually thought of using the pure Yin attribute Streamlet Herb to wrap up the White Willow Beef Shank to offset the earthen taste of the Wood Cicada. Such an idea is truly ingenious, simply causing one to be lost in astonishment.\u201d\u201cLilac, Red Cassia Fruit, Wild Hemp Seed\u2026 The porridge made from these 110 type of spirit fruits is really tasty. It is sweet and refreshing, and also reveals a soft and sticky feeling that\u2019s difficult to explain. Oh! I wonder how Little Brother Chen Xi thought of it, it seems to even contain a nourishing and beautifying function.\u201dThe three 3 leaf spirit chefs tasted down the line in turn and they repeatedly praised as the pleasant surprise in their eyes grew thicker.\u201cSenior Brother, you\u2019ve proven yourself to be able to see what others cannot. With Chen Xi as your disciple, why worry about having no one to inherit your mantle?\u201d Qiao Nan said emotionally. \u201cSeeing Chen Xi makes me recall myself from all those years ago. I was similarly so gloriously talented, similarly so\u2026\u201dOld man Ma directly ignored this narcissistic fellow, and said arrogantly, \u201cNow, this disciple of mine has stepped into the level of a 1 leaf spirit chef. In the next step, I\u2019ll adopt even more severe training methods and make him\u2026\u201d\u201cWait a moment. Give me my salary for these few days, I want to make a trip home.\u201d At an unknown time, Chen Xi had already stood up and he directly interrupted old man Ma with an impolite tone.It was impossible for him to be polite as old man Ma didn\u2019t say a word before throwing him in the Quiet Room, and it was even for over 10 days. Even if it was anyone else, their mood wouldn\u2019t be any better.This kid\u2019s grown a temper huh? Is there any disciple that speaks to their master like this?Old man Ma glared and was just about to flare up when he instead noticed something and exclaimed. \u201cYour cultivation\u2026\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, Qiao Nan and Pei Pei noticed the changes in Chen Xi.Chen Xi\u2019s figure was tall and gaunt before, and had a sedate and stiff temperament at a young age, like a sharp sword that was sealed in dust within its sheath that was restrained and hidden.However at this moment, there was instead a trace of a unique sharp imposing manner on him, and with every move he made, he seemed similar to before, yet he gave others a faintly discernible pressure.\u201cI\u2019ve advanced.\u201d Chen Xi replied. During these few days, besides circulating his cultivation technique in meditation, his remaining time was all spend on cooking dishes. He never expected that his cultivation would surge successively to unknowingly break through to the 8th level of the Congenital Realm!\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Old man Ma gazed at the empty room and instantly understood everything. Although those ingredients that were piled into a hill were only some materials that were barely graded, but all of them contained threads of pure spirit energy. Chen Xi was already at the Congenital Realm, and now that he swallowed so many ingredients in a short amount of time, advancing in cultivation was justifiable.Old man Ma didn\u2019t know that Chen Xi didn\u2019t only break through to the 8th level of the Congenital Realm in qi refining, even his Universe Starslayer Body Forging Technique had been cultivated to the third level, attaining the step of kneading the tendons with water. He was already able to draw upon the baleful qi of the Flexible Waterstar to knead the tendons!Chen Xi\u2019s skin was currently like copper, his tendons and bones like iron, and his body had been tempered to become flexible and tough. It was precisely because of this that his temperament silently underwent a trace of change. He was full of spirit and no longer had the frail appearance from before.Old man Ma seemed to have realized something when he saw Chen Xi\u2019s calm and firm expression: purely forcing Chen Xi to put his heart into studying culinary arts wasn\u2019t realistic. So, he decided to give Chen Xi a few days of leave and raised his hand to throw a Hundred Treasure Bag at Chen Xi. \u201cThe salary for these 15 days is within it. Since you want to return home, then Master won\u2019t stop you. But you still have to hurry back here, don\u2019t waste your natural talent in the culinary Dao.\u201dThe irritation that has accumulated during these past few days dispersed substantially when he obtained the spirit stones and it even came with a Hundred Treasure Bag. He nodded before turning and leaving in a hurry.After walking out of Clear Stream Restaurant and looking at the sun and blue sky that he hadn\u2019t seen for so long, Chen Xi slightly felt as if he was cut off from the outside world for ages, and leaving the Quiet Room felt\u2026 Truly great!Chen Xi didn\u2019t sigh with emotion any more and walked towards his home in a rush. However, he\u2019d only walked halfway when he suddenly felt a trace of a terrifying feeling surge into his heart, as if being targeted by a venomous snake from the shadows.He didn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest as he suddenly stopped his footsteps before turning his head to gaze into the distance.At this moment, Chen Xi was on guard as if being confronted by a formidable enemy and the True Essence in his entire body burst forth. He was like a spear that pierced the sky, with an imposing manner that was matchlessly swift and fierce!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - Bizarre BattlePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 21 - Bizarre BattleNight descended.Luo Chong\u2019s patience was slowly ground off bit by bit and the rage in his heart towards Chen Xi grew as he gazed at the Little Princess who sat before Chen Xi\u2019s home.Luo Chong lost his patience to wait when he saw the sky getting darker and darker, yet there was still no sign of Chen Xi. He decided to take the Little Princess and leave first.However, right at this moment, a strand of extremely concealed murderous air silently came from afar.Luo Chong suddenly raised his head to look at the three figures that used the night sky to shroud themselves as they silently snuck over from afar and dense killing intent instantly surged in his heart.Within Pine Mist City, the General\u2019s Estate formally decreed the prohibition of violence. If there were violators, then without exception their cultivation would be crippled before being expelled from the city. As the number one expert under the command of the General\u2019s Estate, during these years, Luo Chong had always led the guards of the General\u2019s Estate to patrol day and night within the city, protecting the peace of this territory.And yet at this moment, there were three assassins that had silently appeared within the Commoners District. This was obviously challenging the honor and authority of the General\u2019s Estate!What made Luo Chong the most furious was that the direction these three assassins snuck towards was shockingly where he was, and the Little Princess Qin Hongmian was nearby. If their target was the Little Princess, then\u2026 The life of the Little Princess would be exposed to a great threat, and its consequences were absolutely unimaginable!\u201cNot only challenging the honor of my General\u2019s Estate, but you still want to harm the Little Princess. If I don\u2019t kill all of you, what face would I, Luo Chong, have to face the General?\u201d Luo Chong took a deep breath, and the killing intent within his chest had boiled to the limit.Yet his eyes were extremely calm as he concealed himself in the shadows at the corner, his figure had perfectly blended with the darkness, causing one to be unable to notice a shred of his presence. Within his hand, a long and narrow saber that was pitch-black like ink had suddenly appeared.\u2026The Dao of stealth and assassination is truly the king of the night!Manager Wu stood in the distance, gazing upon Li Han, Li Feng, and Li Zhan\u2019s figures that snuck in the darkness. When he was unable to locate them any longer, he couldn\u2019t help but exclaim with heartfelt admiration.Manager Wu briefly considered before shooting his gaze at the extremely faraway old and shabby house.Manage Wu had been endlessly depressed and at a loss for allowing Chen Xi to save Chen Hao and that woman from within his grasp. Until this moment when he thought of how Chen Xi\u2019s cultivation would soon be crippled soundlessly, all the dissatisfaction in his heart instantly vanished and he became excited.A jinx that was already infamous within Pine Mist City also had his cultivation crippled and became a piece of trash. What a beautiful scene this would be!The more he thought about it, the more excited he became, and a trace of complacency and viciousness appeared on Manager Wu\u2019s emaciated face.Om!Extremely far away, a low and ear piercing sound that was like tearing silk resounded out, and accompanying the sound was a beautiful black light like a waterfall as it suddenly tore through the sky.Manager Wu was startled, then he leapt up a house to look over.In the next moment, the complacent expression on his face froze.A tall figure stood in mid-air, wearing violet clothes and holding a long and narrow saber in hand. On the house where the tall figure stood, the three Li Clan brothers stood there completely covered in black clothing that only revealed their eyes.\u201cEradication Blade! Luo Chong!\u201d At practically the moment he laid eyes upon the tall figure, Manager Wu recognized who it was, and his triangular eyes were instantly filled with astonishment and terror.Luo Chong was the only cultivator in Pine Mist City that used a long and narrow saber, and amongst the names of sabers that people were familiar with, the Eradication Blade in Luo Chong\u2019s hand would absolutely be ranked at the first.Most importantly, not only was Luo Chong\u2019s cultivation unfathomable, he was even the number one expert under the command of General Qin, and he represented the supreme honor of the General\u2019s Estate!\u201cBastard! I fucking asked you all to go cripple Chen Xi\u2019s cultivation, how did this baleful existence, Luo Chong, get attracted? What the fuck is going on?\u201dManager Wu was already completely devoid of the earlier relaxed and complacent expression. At this moment, his heart was filled with boundless bitterness and terror, and his emaciated face was extremely gloomy and unsightly.\u201cThis won\u2019t do! I have to go forward and warn them. So long as they don\u2019t attack, there\u2019s surely room for discussion. Otherwise, offending Luo Chong is equivalent to offending the General\u2019s Estate. How would my Li Clan continue living in Pine Mist City?\u201d Manager Wu took a deep breath as he forcefully restrained the terror in his heart. He was just intending to head over and stop them, but before he could even head over, the confrontational situation in the distance was completely brought to an end.\u201cKill!\u201d A low and deep explosive shout sounded out from afar, and Li Han\u2019s group of three unsheathed their weapons before dashing out towards Luo Chong who was in mid-air.At this moment, the last trace of hope in Manager Wu\u2019s heart collapsed with a loud crash, and his eyes were empty and despondent as he muttered. \u201cI\u2019ve really never fucking noticed anyone in this world that\u2019s more idiotic than these three brothers. Motherfucker! That\u2019s Luo Chong! Are your eyes in your anus? Even if you don\u2019t know Luo Chong, would it kill you to greet him before attacking?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d At the moment that the sad and shrill cries resounded in the night, it also stopped abruptly.Manager Wu shivered in his heart as he raised his head, he saw three heads flying up mid-air as they dripped blood. They flew in a beautiful arc in the sky before heavily mashing onto the ground, completely shattering into a pool of muddy flesh that had bone fragments mixed within.\u201cIt\u2019s over\u2026 The mission this time has been completely fucked by these three idiots\u2026\u201d Manager Wu was frightened out of his wits as he muttered, utterly not daring to stop for even a moment as he turned and fled madly. He appeared as if he wished for nothing more than for his parents to have given him two more legs at birth.Luo Chong stood mid-air in the distance, he didn\u2019t even spare a glance at the three corpses on the ground as he shot his gaze into the distance to follow the figure that was fleeing in panic. The corners of his mouth couldn\u2019t help but curl into a trace of a ridicule.Since the instant he noticed Li Han\u2019s group of three, he\u2019d noticed that another person was concealed in the distance. After slightly sizing up the person, he recognized the person as the Li Clan\u2019s Manager Wu and he finally made sense of everything.One month ago, the Li Clan\u2019s Young Master had fought with Chen Hao on the streets and was reported to the General\u2019s Estate. For the fear of hurting their relationship with Li Clan, General Qin only ordered the Li Clan to pay a large sum to atone for their crimes.Luo Chong knew from that moment onwards that the Li Clan would absolutely not be able to stomach this loss. As expected, today, Manager Wu and three assassins had appeared nearby Chen Xi\u2019s home, exactly confirming this.Thinking up to here, Luo Chong felt furious and amused at the same time. He originally thought that these people were coming for the Little Princess, Qin Hongmian, but unexpectedly they had come for Chen Xi and he just happened to encounter them. The god of destiny really does make fools of people.Luo Chong arrived before Chen Xi\u2019s home, then looked at Qin Hongmian who squatted on the stairs with her arms around her legs and said in a low voice, \u201cMiss, let\u2019s go. The General will be worried if you continue staying here.\u201d\u201cI want to wait for him. I won\u2019t be able to sleep soundly if I can\u2019t figure out the structure of these talisman markings.\u201d Qin Hongmian shook her head, and her clear and beautiful little face had a staunch and persistent expression.Luo Chong didn\u2019t dare go against Qin Hongmian\u2019s feelings and could only give up. In his heart however, he was even more furious at Chen Xi, because he felt that he would soon become the protector of Chen Xi\u2019s home\u2026\u2014\u2014As he felt the fierce and sharp aura that hovered around him, Chen Xi\u2019s nerves strained as he paid attention to the movement in his surroundings, and he swiftly pondered in his mind.Whoosh!An eye-piercing sword light shot out and tore through the sky, emitting a sharp howl.Chen Xi\u2019s strained nerves relaxed quite a bit when he saw this strand of sword light, as an enemy that was concealed in the shadows was the most terrifying. Now, the enemy had exposed himself, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about being silently dealt with a sneak attack anymore.However, he still didn\u2019t dare be careless, as this strand of sword light was condensed into a solid form and all the strength on it seemed to have gather on a single point. Even if he\u2019d already advanced to the 8th level of the Congenital Realm and his body refinement technique had already attained the step of using the baleful qi of the Flexible Waterstar to knead the tendons, but the pure sharp aura on the sword light still caused him to feel a trace of a great threat.Chen Xi didn\u2019t dare hesitate as he fiercely stomped his left foot, then his figure rotated like an axle, turning onto his side with an extremely unsightly movement before flashing explosively towards the side, barely dodging past this strand of sword light.Clang!Along with the sound of a sword entering its sheath, that fierce and sharp sword light seemed to vanish into thin air as it instantly vanished.\u201cInstructor Meng Kong, I told you right? I can\u2019t defeat my brother even if it\u2019s a sneak attack.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s heart shook as the familiar voice resounded in his ears, then he raised his head to look and saw Chen Hao has suddenly appeared in the alley to the side.By Chen Hao\u2019s side, it was shockingly Meng Kong, the 6th star Violet Palace Realm expert that was reputed as the number one sword cultivator in Pine Mist Institution!\u201cBrother, you won\u2019t get angry with me right?\u201d Chen Hao had an obedient expression as he walked over to Chen Xi\u2019s side and explained. \u201cInstructor Meng Kong said that my progress this month is unusually great and my sword technique has already broken through the advanced-stage to attain the unity-stage. So, I would surely be able to defeat you. But unexpectedly\u2026\u201dChen Xi patted his younger brother\u2019s shoulder and interrupted with a gentle voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain, progress is a good thing. But don\u2019t take me as practice again, do you understand?\u201dChen Hao fiercely nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cYour cultivation has advanced?\u201d Meng Kong suddenly spoke, his steadfast expression revealing a sense of surprise and bewilderment.Chen Hao\u2019s actions earlier weren\u2019t suggested by him. But, Meng Kong had said with certainty earlier that with Chen Hao\u2019s current strength, he would completely be able to defeat Chen Xi.There was a reason that Meng Kong made such a judgement. It was because Chen Xi still had a cultivation at the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm one month ago and according to his judgment, Chen Xi seemed to not be adept in battle.Whereas Chen Hao was different, the little fellow was undoubtedly a rare sword cultivating genius. In the month he was at Pine Mist Institution, he not only attained the unity-stage in his sword technique, but even his cultivation has successively broke through two levels to arrive at the 3rd level of the Congenital Realm. So, it ought to be more than sufficient to defeat his older brother.But unexpectedly, Chen Hao\u2019s sword strike that was originally certain to be successful was instead easily dodged by Chen Xi, and this naturally aroused Meng Kong\u2019s curiosity and wonder.\u201cMy cultivation has indeed advanced to the 8th level of the Congenital Realm.\u201d Chen Xi replied. Instructor Meng Kong was Chen Hao\u2019s master in sword cultivation and had a special relationship with Bai Wanqing. There was completely no need to hide the advancement of his cultivation to Meng Kong.\u201c8th level of the Congenital Realm? Brother! You\u2019re too formidable!\u201d Chen Hao gaped, and his small face was filled with adoration.\u201cSuccessively breaking through five levels within a month?\u201d Meng Kong was unable to maintain his composure as well, and he stared at Chen Xi with a strange gaze, as if he was staring at a freak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - Wandering Cloud Sword SectPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22 - Wandering Cloud Sword SectMeng Kong ceaselessly praised in his heart.If the numerous disciples of Pine Mist Institution knew that Meng Kong who possessed the reputation of Grim-face Instructor was able to praise others as well, their jaws would absolutely drop from shock.\u201cRight, doesn\u2019t the Pine Mist Institution prohibit disciples from going out?\u201d Chen Xi asked, as seeing Meng Kong beside Chen Hao, he vaguely felt that something should have happened.Chen Hao nodded. \u201cBrother, Uncle Meng Kong wants to take me to leave Pine Mist Institution and head towards Dragon Lake City to enter the Wandering Cloud Sword Sect to train. I came out this time precisely to listen to your opinion.\u201dChen Xi\u2019s heart fiercely shook and he shot his gaze at Meng Kong.If sects were divided into various grades and ranks, then the Wandering Cloud Sword Sect that was situated within Dragon Lake City that was at the heart of the southern territory would absolutely be a first-rate sect. Supposedly there were quite a few Earthly Immortal Realm experts that lived in seclusion within the Wandering Cloud Sword Sect. Also, the abundance of the Wandering Cloud Sword Sect\u2019s hidden resources and reserves was something that very few powers in the entire southern territory could compare to.\u201cChen Hao\u2019s comprehension in the Dao of the sword is superb, and what\u2019s even harder to come by is his Sword Heart which is solid. Thus, he\u2019s extremely suitable for the path of a sword cultivator. I feel we should allow him to go to the Wandering Cloud Sword Sect to receive the most legitimate training in swordsmanship, and not learn in a small place like Pine Mist City. Otherwise, it would delay his future.\u201dMeng Kong said in a deep voice, \u201cBesides that, you don\u2019t have to worry about his safety on the way. I\u2019ll send him all the way to Wandering Cloud Sword Sect.\u201dChen Xi was only worried about this, because a month ago, his grandfather precisely lost his life in the hands of their enemies while sending his younger brother to Dragon Lake City to participate in the Thousand Sword Sect\u2019s test.Now when he heard that Meng Kong would accompany Chen Hao, Chen Xi completely let go of his worries, then he looked at Chen Hao\u2019s eyes as he said earnestly, \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up already, Big Brother respects your choice. The Wandering Cloud Sword Sect is stronger than the Thousand Sword Sect. If you\u2019ve really decided to go, then you must make sure to take good care of yourself.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Chen Hao had a staunch expression as he said, \u201cBrother, don\u2019t worry. Once I finish learning and return, we\u2019ll surely kill all the enemies of our Chen Clan!\u201dA trace of worry couldn\u2019t help but arise within Meng Kong\u2019s heart, as the more one had a staunch mentality, the more obstinate and stubborn one was. If Chen Hao\u2019s Sword Heart was blinded by hatred, then there was an extremely high likelihood that he might experience qi deviation one day in the future.Chen Xi frowned and berated. \u201cDon\u2019t mention the matter of taking revenge again in the future! If I find out that you went looking for our enemies alone, then don\u2019t call me brother anymore!\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Chen Hao sulkily lowered his head when he saw Chen Xi getting angry, but the obstinate expression in his eyes didn\u2019t change in the slightest.\u201cHow about this, once you attain the Golden Core Realm, you can do whatever you want, and I won\u2019t interfere.\u201d How could Chen Xi not understand Chen Hao\u2019s thoughts? He knew he couldn\u2019t use force but had to gradually persuade Chen Hao, so he instantly put forward a suggestion of compromise.\u201cThis suggestion is good!\u201d Chen Hao raised his head in excitement then cried out. \u201cBrother, just you wait. I\u2019ll quickly attain the Golden Core Realm, and at that time you better not stop me anymore.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a deal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a deal!\u201dThe two brothers stretched out their fists and tightly grasped each other\u2019s hand.Meng Kong lightly smiled and was just about to say something when he suddenly turned around to gaze into the distance.Under the night sky, a silhouette swiftly flashed over like the wind, yet the figure emitted a trace of a panicked and terrified aura.\u201cChen Xi!\u201d The silhouette that was running madly suddenly stopped and exclaimed in surprise as he gazed at Chen Xi who stood in the distance.At this moment, Chen Xi and Chen Hao finally recognized the person, it was shockingly the Li Clan\u2019s Manager Wu.Manager Wu was in an extremely sorry state; his emaciated face was extremely pale and a trace of bitterness and terror still remained in his expression. Chen Xi\u2019s group of three couldn\u2019t help but be slightly curious when they saw this.Manager Wu\u2019s gaze flashed past Meng Kong and he couldn\u2019t help but be stunned. He recalled Luo Chong who was before Chen Xi\u2019s home and his face became even more unsightly.\u201cChen Xi, you\u2019re going too far! Having an ambush and support, what an atrocious plan! Just you wait! My Li Clan will absolutely not let you off!\u201d Manager Wu didn\u2019t dare stop for a moment after fiercely putting down a threat, he turned tail and fled.It wasn\u2019t only Chen Xi, even Chen Hao and Meng Kong were clearly confused.They didn\u2019t know that in the heart of Manager Wu, he\u2019d long since firmly believed that everything that happened tonight was a trap that Chen Xi had placed after deliberate planning for the sake of dealing with him and the three Li Clan brothers in one fell swoop.\u201cHmph, it\u2019s only an old dog of the Li Clan\u2019s, there\u2019s no need to pay any attention to him.\u201d Meng Kong grunted coldly with a voice that contained dense disdain.\u201cBrother, did that old dog look for trouble with you while I was training at Pine Mist Institution?\u201d Chen Hao gnashed his teeth, \u00a0his face filled with killing intent.Chen Xi shook his head. \u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and go home. The reason old dog Wu was fleeing in a flustered state tonight might be near our home.\u201dMeng Kong sighed with admiration in his heart. They\u2019d only come into contact with Manager Wu for a short moment and Chen Xi was already able to roughly determine the reason Manager Wu was fleeing in a sorry state. Such wisdom and thinking could practically be called close to demonic!\u2026\u201cMeng Kong!\u201d\u201cLuo Chong!\u201dWhen they arrived before Chen Xi\u2019s house and saw Qin Hongmian who sat on the stairs and Luo Chong who stood respectfully by her side, Meng Kong was startled as he exclaimed in surprise.Right at the moment Meng Kong had just opened his mouth, a ball of cold light abruptly shot out of Luo Chong\u2019s eyes and he practically exclaimed in surprise at the same moment.Obviously, the two of them ought to be quite familiar with each other. As for how their relationship was, Chen Xi was unable to judge. However, he finally confirmed something, the fleeing of Manager Wu surely had something to do with this number one expert under the command of the General\u2019s Estate, Luo Chong.\u201cMeng Kong, you\u2019re finally willing to step out of Pine Mist Institution? Do you dare fight me today?\u201d Luo Chong was like a child that had seen its favorite toy, he stared at Meng Kong with a burning gaze and his tall figure suddenly surged with billowing battle intent!\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d Meng Kong shook his head with an expressionless face. His tone was dull, as if he wasn\u2019t afraid of Luo Chong attacking him in the slightest.In fact, Meng Kong had a slight headache when he saw Luo Chong.In the eyes of others, perhaps Luo Chong is the Grand Commander of the General\u2019s Estate that could only be revered, but in the eyes of Meng Kong, this fellow was absolutely a madman that was addicted to battle. So long as one was believed to be an opponent that could be battled by this fellow, then he would stick to you like how traditional paste medicine stuck to the body. Unless one fought him straight off, otherwise, one would absolutely be unable to flee from this fellow\u2019s harassment.Meng Kong wasn\u2019t afraid to battle Luo Chong, but as a prideful sword cultivator, his sword was used to kill and not spar, and he was unwilling for his own sword to become a whetstone for another, so he was absolutely unable to agree to this.\u201cThat won\u2019t do. You have to agree today even if you don\u2019t want to. It was so difficult to catch you, I can\u2019t let you off so easily.\u201d At this moment, Luo Chong was no different from a madman, he unsheathed long and narrow, pitch-black Eradication Blade with a clang, and a terrifying aura shot out to instantly firmly lock onto Meng Kong.\u201cIf you dare attack, I\u2019ll use the name of the Pine Mist Institution to notify the General\u2019s Estate. As the Grand Commander of the General\u2019s Estate, actually stirring up trouble on the street. I wonder how General Qin would think of it when he finds out?\u201d Meng Kong\u2019s expression remained unfazed as he spoke unhurriedly.\u201cYou\u2026 Shameless!\u201d Luo Chong was hit in his soft spot and flew into a rage.\u201cHmph.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too shameless!\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re simply shameless to an unreasonable extent!\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201d\u2026\u2026Seeing Luo Chong and Meng Kong who were like bickering children, Chen Xi and Chen Hao looked at each other and were both speechless.\u201cYou\u2019re Chen Xi?\u201d There was someone more composed than Chen Xi and Chen Hao, even to the extent of completely ignoring Luo Chong and Meng Kong. She was naturally the Little Princess of the General\u2019s Estate that was madly addicted to the Dao of talismans, Qin Hongmian.\u201cOh, I am.\u201d Chen Xi recovered from his shock and sized Qin Hongmian up. He couldn\u2019t help but be slightly curious when he saw that it was a young girl with a neat and beautiful disposition.\u201cI\u2019ve finally found you.\u201d Qin Hongmian laughed happily, then she withdrew a pile of talismans from a small and exquisite Hundred Treasure Bag and said quickly, \u201cThese are all the talismans you crafted that I bought from the market. The structure of the talisman markings had of style of its own that\u2019s novel and mysterious, and its might has increased by nearly double. I want to know the principle behind it, I wonder if you can help me understand?\u201dPractically everyone in Pine Mist City knew that the Little Princess, Qin Hongmian, of the General\u2019s Estate was addicted to the Dao of talismans. At this moment, when he heard this young girl speaking of talismans and the structure of talisman markings the moment she opened her mouth, Chen Xi was finally able to confirm the identity of the neat and beautiful young girl before him.\u201cI\u2019m only a talisman crafting apprentice, it seems I\u2019m unable to help you, right?\u201dQin Hongmian\u2019s eyes sprang wide open as she said in disappointment, \u201cBut all these talismans were crafted by you, how are you be unable to help me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Chen Xi really didn\u2019t know how to reply when faced with a young girl who was addicted to the Dao of talismans and had pure thoughts that weren\u2019t tainted with the ways of the world. He thought for a moment then extended his hand to take a talisman from Qin Hongmian\u2019s hands, then slightly sized it up before recognizing that this was one of the Earthshield talismans he crafted after comprehending the Fuxi Divine Statue.\u201cI\u2019m indeed unable to explain the reason behind it. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t want to tell you, but it\u2019s that even I haven\u2019t figured out why I can craft such a structure.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Qin Hongmian stared with her clear and innocent eyes with a confused and puzzled appearance.Chen Xi nodded, he was indeed not deceiving Qin Hongmian, those new version talismans were purely a product of the uncomfortable feeling he felt while crafting talismans and he still hadn\u2019t figured out the specific reason. How would he dare agree to Qin Hongmian\u2019s request?\u201cHow could it be like this?\u201d Qin Hongmian pursed her small mouth and her eyes became red as tears dripped down.Chen Xi was extremely stunned.\u201cKid! Do you know that the Young Miss of my General\u2019s Estate had been waiting here for you for an entire day?\u201dLuo Chong suddenly rushed over when he saw Qin Hongmian crying and berated \u00a0him with a low voice. \u201cTo think that I even helped you kill the three assassins the Li Clan sent, but I never imagined that you, kid, would be so heartless and ungrateful!\u201d\u201cUncle Luo, it isn\u2019t your fault, it\u2019s mine.\u201d Qin Hongmian persuaded in a low voice as she cried. Her appearance was tender and delicate and caused one to be unable to help from feeling tender and protective towards her.Luo Chong was even more furious when he saw this, then he stared at Chen Xi and said in a deep voice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree to the Young Miss\u2019s request today, then I\u2019ll fucking tie you up and bring you into the General\u2019s Estate!\u201d\u201cYou dare!\u201d Chen Hao who hadn\u2019t spoken all this time spoke out first, his small face was filled with rage as he stared at Luo Chong and shouted. \u201cMy brother didn\u2019t offend her, on what basis are you tying up my brother and bringing him into the General\u2019s Estate?\u201dChen Xi stopped his brother and shook his head to stop Chen Hao from speaking any more, then he shot his gaze onto Qin Hongmian and said in a light voice. \u201cI indeed do not know how I did it, but I\u2019m instead able to give you a suggestion.\u201dQin Hongmian\u2019s eyes lit up as she wiped off her tears.\u201cI feel that cultivating a visualization technique to make your soul stronger ought to have extremely great benefits to the Dao of talismans.\u201d Chen Xi pondered for a moment then slowly spoke.\u201cVisualization technique?\u201d Chen Xi had only just finished speaking when Luo Chong and Meng Kong both exclaimed in surprise at the same time, their faces filled with disbelief.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Exquisite PavilionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23 - Exquisite PavilionChen Xi couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly curious when he saw the stupefaction on Meng Kong and Luo Chong\u2019s faces.\u201cBrother, I\u2019ve heard Instructor Meng Kong say that soul visualization techniques are extremely rare. No more than three powers within Pine Mist City possess a visualization technique.\u201d\u201cThe reason that visualization techniques are valuable is because they\u2019re unable to be passed down in the form of jade slips or physical writing and illustrations. Instead, it requires being personally passed down by the original owner via a type of Secret Technique, and is only able to be passed down to one person and not be passed on widely. This is precisely also the reason why it\u2019s so rare.\u201dChen Hao noticed Chen Xi\u2019s confusion and explained by his ears in a low voice. \u201cHowever, I\u2019ve also heard that those ancient sects with abundant hidden resources and reserves possesses different Visualization Secret Treasures that are forged by remarkable figures using their own thoughts. One can comprehend a visualization method through these Visualization Secret Treasures, like the Inscribed Swordstone of the Wandering Sword Sect is a mysterious Visualization Secret Treasure.\u201dChen Xi came to a suddenly understanding as he recalled the Fuxi Divine Statue within his mind, and only now did he deeply feel it become valuable.\u201cI\u2019ll learn a visualization technique as soon as possible. If I\u2019m still unable to comprehend the mystery of the structure of these talisman markings at that time, then I\u2019ll come look for you again.\u201d Qin Hongmian clenched her small fists and her clear eyes emitted a light of burning staunchness as she waved her hand at Chen Xi before turning and leaving.\u201cMeng Kong, forget it this time. I\u2019ll surely battle you next time!\u201d Luo Chong was unable to care about asking Chen Xi about the visualization technique when he saw Qin Hongmian leaving. He fiercely glared at Meng Kong before leaving rather unwillingly.\u201cThe madman finally left.\u201d Meng Kong smiled when he saw the two of them leaving, then he turned around to look at Chen Xi with a strange gaze. \u201cNo wonder you advanced so quickly. So it turns out that you\u2019ve cultivated a visualization technique.\u201d\u201cProbably.\u201d Chen Xi casually replied and was unwilling to speak any more about it.\u201cA visualization technique is extremely marvellous, and extremely rare and valuable. Don\u2019t talk about this with anyone in the future, otherwise, your life might be in danger.\u201dMeng Kong smiled. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, although Luo Chong is a madman, he will surely not reveal your secret.\u201dChen Xi nodded, but he secretly thought in his heart,\u2026The next day, Meng Kong brought Chen Hao along to step foot on the path to Dragon Lake City.Chen Xi was already feeling sad and reluctant because of his younger brother\u2019s departure, so when he saw Bai Wanqing bringing Xixi along to leave with Meng Kong, his mood became even more downcast.\u201cBrother, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll work extremely hard. You have to take good care of yourself as well. Be sure to not be worried about me\u2026\u201d\u201cChen Xi, since the day I brought Chen Hao to see Meng Kong, I\u2019d already promised to leave Pine Mist City and return to Dragon Lake City with him. You have to take good care of yourself, and if you go to Dragon Lake City you must come see Aunt Bai.\u201d\u201cBig Brother Chen Xi, Xixi is leaving. This is the green orange candy that Xixi love the most, we\u2019ll each eat half. After you\u2019ve eaten it, then you\u2019re Xixi\u2019s best friend. BYE!\u201dThe voices of Chen Hao, Aunt Bai, and Xixi still lingered in his ears as Chen Xi sat in his room and stared blankly for a long time before slowly opening a beautiful note in his hand.Hu~Chen Xi heaved a long sigh after he finished reading the note.Chen Xi had reaped great benefit from the long conversation last night with Meng Kong, the sword cultivator that was the strongest in Pine Mist Institution. He understood that even though his cultivation surged in advancement all the way, the strength that he was able to exert was just barely satisfactory. Tracing it to its cause, it was still because of that he only took consideration to his talisman crafting and culinary arts, and had neglected the cultivation of martial techniques.Now when he saw the note Meng Kong left especially for him, at the same time that Chen Xi felt grateful, a heroic spirit couldn\u2019t help but arise in his heart.In the past, due to having to bring home the bacon and help his younger brother pay his tuition, his time was all used on crafting talismans and learning culinary arts, and he completely had no time to cultivate martial techniques. Now, after Chen Hao left, he only needed to complete the payment for Pine Mist Institution's tuition and he could pull out some time to properly cultivate martial techniques.Chen Xi silently pondered for a long time before walking out of his room.\u2026Zhang General Store.Due to the new-version talismans being sold to exhaustion, the explosive scene of rushing to purchase the talismans in a frenzy all these days had gradually calmed down.But, compared to before, the reputation of the Zhang General Store has already resounded in the entire Pine Mist City, and the daily flow of customers was a few times more than before. Under these circumstances, Boss Zhang Dayong didn\u2019t have to worry about being unable to earn spirit stones.\u201cUncle Zhang.\u201d Chen Xi pushed open the door and entered.The eyes of Zhang Dayong who was sleeping behind the counter suddenly sprang open upon hearing Chen Xi and his face beamed with smiles. Moreover, the ten plus talisman crafting apprentices that were busy at the side all stopped their actions, and their faces all emitted a sense of admiration and envy.Because of the appearance of the new version first-grade talismans, all of the talisman crafting apprentices benefited from Chen Xi and obtained a great increase in their salary. How could they still ridicule and mock Chen Xi as before?Chen Xi has been staying within the Clear Stream Restaurant\u2019s Quiet Room all this time, so he didn\u2019t know the explosive degree that his new version talismans were welcomed in the market, and he also didn\u2019t know that he\u2019d been crowned with the honorary title of \u2018Mysterious Grand Talisman Master.\u2019So, he swept everyone with a slightly curious gaze and compared to the other people present, his mood was much calmer.Zhang Dayong had a smile on his face as he invited Chen Xi into an elegant room, then Zhang Da Yong feigned anger as he said, \u201cKid! You disappeared for an entire 15 days and you still have the face to see me?\u201dChen Xi slightly blushed with shame. \u201cUncle, I had some other matters to attend to during these past few days, and was unable to get away from it for some time, so\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, you\u2019ve already grown up, and you have your own matters to attend to. Uncle can understand.\u201d Zhang Dayong waved his hand as he seemed not to mind as he spoke, then he smiled as he asked, \u201cHow many talismans have you crafted before coming this time?\u201dChen Xi shook his head and deliberated before saying, \u201cUncle Zhang, I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to craft talismans in the future, as I want to concentrate on cultivating martial techniques to increase my strength.\u201dZhang Dayong was stunned and only recovered from his shock after a long time, then he sighed with emotion. \u201cI knew this day would come, but I never thought it would be so fast.\u201dChen Xi had a slightly complicated mood as he walked out of Zhang general goods store.If it wasn\u2019t for Zhang Dayong showing consideration for them during these past few years, then he, his younger brother, and his grandfather would probably have been reduced to beggars on the street since a long time ago. Now, for the sake of cultivating martial techniques, he had no choice but to leave this work, and he couldn\u2019t help but be slightly ashamed.\u201cUncle Zhang, I, Chen Xi, will never forget this kindness!\u201d After standing before the Zhang general store signboard for a long time, a trace of staunchness flashed within Chen Xi\u2019s eyes before he resolutely turned and left.\u2026Exquisite Pavilion.The Exquisite Pavilion was a rather famous place in Pine Mist City that specialized in the sale of cultivation methods, from the low grade cultivation methods to high grade cultivation methods, it had everything that one expected to find. It greatly satisfied the needs of many independent cultivators and there was even no lack of powers like clans and institutions who had cultivators come here to uncover treasures.Chen Xi currently stood before the counter and gazed at the superb collection of various martial technique ancient books, and wasn\u2019t sure where to start.\u201cSenior, do you want me to help you select some cultivation methods?\u201d A beautiful female attendant nearby spoke and suggested.Chen Xi thought for a moment, then asked, \u201cWhat body refinement martial techniques do you have?\u201dThe female attendant was startled and a trace of disdain flashed deep within her eyes. In Pine Mist City, body refiners were mostly some coolies of lowly status who had no money nor power and were extremely poor.At this moment, when she heard Chen Xi wanted to purchase some body refinement cultivation methods, the female attendant naturally took him for a pauper that struggled in poverty.\u201cThere\u2019s very few cultivation methods for body refinement, only around ten methods. Please look over here.\u201d The female attendants attitude become extremely cold and she didn\u2019t even both to call him \u2018Senior\u2019 as she pointed towards a corner of the counter.\u201cTiger Subduing Claw, Dragonform Footwork Technique, Great Demon Subduing Palm, Golden Roc Movement Technique\u2026\u201d Chen Xi swept pass them one by one and couldn\u2019t help but say in amazement, \u201cThe price of every single one is more than 100 spirit stones, and these are only basic body refinement martial skills. Doesn\u2019t the price seems slightly unreasonable?\u201dThe female attendant was even more disdainful in her heart as she replied indifferently, \u201cThese are all the valuable martial skills that my Exquisite Pavilion has gathered together, even if it\u2019s a basic martial skill, it\u2019s much more formidable compared to those common martial skills on the market. If you feel it\u2019s expensive, then you can go look at other places.\u201dAs she spoke, the female attendant turned and left, and she muttered, \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford it then say you can\u2019t, still complaining it\u2019s expensive. Hmph! These body refiners are truly poor to an unreasonable extent.\u201dChen Xi shook his head and was lazy to fuss about it with the female attendant. He spent 100 spirit stones and purchased the Grand Collapsing Fist and has only just walked out of the Exquisite Pavilion\u2019s door when he was called from behind.\u201cChen Xi!\u201d The voice was deep and powerful.Chen Xi turned around to see the tall and mighty Luo Chong walk out of Exquisite Pavilion.\u201cThese are 13 body refinement jade slips that the Young Miss bought for you. Take it,\u201d said Luo Chong as he threw a Hundred Treasure Bag to Chen Xi before turning around and once again entering the Exquisite Pavilion.Chen Xi was extremely stunned, then his gaze swept towards the Exquisite Pavilion and he surprisingly saw Qin Hongmian in a plain dress waving towards him.But, Chen Xi was unable to accept this gift, as the saying goes, no gains without pains. He didn\u2019t want to owe this favour to her, so he once again walked into the Exquisite Pavilion, however after looking around, he noticed that Qin Hongmian had long since vanished.\u201cSenior, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The female attendant walked over, seeming to have taken an extremely heavy blow, she apologized with a low voice that revealed a trace of dejection and dense reverence, and didn\u2019t have a trace of her earlier cold and cynical appearance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - GuidancePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24 - GuidanceChen Xi didn\u2019t loiter around after exiting the Exquisite Pavilion and hurried on to the Clear Stream Restaurant.Old man Ma couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly gratified when he saw Chen Xi who returned just a day later. \u201c\u201cI want to do closed door cultivation within the Quiet Room.\u201d Chen Xi put forward his request.Although Manager Wu\u2019s assassination operation that targeted him was gotten rid of by Luo Chong unintentionally, but Chen Xi didn\u2019t feel at ease in the slightest as the feeling of danger in his heart had increased rather than decreased.For the sake of protecting himself, he had no choice but to leave his talisman crafting work, and he planned to stay in the Clear Stream Restaurant from now on to practice his culinary arts while cultivating martial skills.Old man Ma felt even happier when he heard this, then he waved his hand. \u201cAlright! I\u2019ll prepare all the ingredients for you. I\u2019m really anticipating the day you advance to become a 2 leaf spirit chef.\u201dChen Xi secretly heaved a sigh of relief and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll work hard.\u201dIn next to no time, Chen Xi had once again arrived within the Quiet Room, and he pondered as he gazed at the surrounding ingredients that were piled into hills.Chen Xi didn\u2019t delay before starting to distinguish and sort ingredients according to their differing attributes and taste.With the experience from last time, Chen Xi seemed to be already able to accomplish this with ease, and it wasn\u2019t long before he\u2019d already finished dividing the room full of ingredients.Afterwards, he came before the stove and started cooking.Chen Xi had currently already attained the grade of 1 leaf spirit chef in his culinary arts. Regardless of knife skill, control of the flames, or the combination of ingredient flavor, he had a deep understanding of them all.However, if he wanted to advance to become a 2 leaf spirit chef, then he must be able to cook dishes that were able to greatly benefit Congenital Realm cultivators, and this posed quite a degree of difficulty to Chen Xi.He was lucky that he had the support of old man Ma, so Chen Xi didn\u2019t have to worry about facing a shortage of ingredients in the slightest. He wasn\u2019t afraid even if he failed, as he was completely capable of trying time after time to find a path of the culinary Dao that belonged to him.The kitchen knife fluttered like snow to finish preparing the ingredients, then Chen Xi controlled the spirit flames as he poured the ingredients into the iron wok and started cooking carefully.His wrist was steady and numb,his expression focused. He successively vibrated the iron wok and iron ladle according to a strange rhythm, and the various ingredients ceaselessly rolled about within the burning hot wok like spindrifts that fluttered out layer upon layer and was extremely pleasing to the eye.Chen Xi clearly noticed that cooking this time seemed much smoother and easier than before, and all the subtle changes that occurred on the various ingredients within the iron work were understood and grasped in his heart.\u201cIt ought to be because of me visualizing the Fuxi Divine Statue all the time, this feeling is simply exactly similar to when I crafted those new version talismans!\u201d Chen Xi exclaimed ceaselessly, as he now fully understood the point that made visualization techniques valuable.Sizzle!Right in his moment of absent-mindedness, the ingredients within the iron wok was completely burnt.Chen Xi hurriedly concentrated his mind and didn\u2019t dare let his imagination run wild anymore.Even then, Chen Xi spent an entire afternoon in failure. It couldn\u2019t be helped, under the circumstances that he didn\u2019t have anyone to guide him, and he could only rely on himself to learn by trial and error. It was obviously an extremely difficult thing.The failed dishes were all stuffed into his stomach one by one. Iit was firstly for the sake of analysing the reason for failure, and secondly was that even though he failed to cook these ingredients properly, they still contained a large amount of residual spirit energy that was \u00a0able to replenish the used True Essence within his Dantian.Chen Xi only stopped cooking when night arrived, then sat cross-legged in meditation.Practicing his culinary arts for the entire afternoon was extremely tiring for his mind. At the moment, he\u2019d just started meditating when his mind was quickly immersed in a gentle and peaceful state.Swoosh!Surging True Essence was like a rolling great river that ceaselessly flowed within the meridians in his entire body.These True Essence were condensed from the spirit energy that was contained within the ingredients Chen Xi had eaten during the entire afternoon and accumulated within his body. They were like numerous spirit pills that swiftly transformed into pure True Essence that surged into his Dantian the moment Chen Xi circulated his cultivation technique.After two hours, Chen Xi awoke from his meditation, and he couldn\u2019t help but be delighted in his heart when he noticed that his cultivation had obviously advanced slightly. If he were to continue cultivating at this impetus, he would probably be completely capable of advancing to the 9th level of the Congenital Realm within a month!After arriving at the 9th level of the Congenital Realm, Chen Xi only needed to accumulate sufficient True Essence before being able to develop a Violet Palace within his Dantian, and then establish his Dao foundation to become a true cultivator who has stepped onto the road of immortal cultivation. At that time, not only would Chen Xi be able to fly in the sky, but he would able to utilize Magic Treasures and his strength would obtain an enormous qualitative change!Chen Xi silently pondered for a moment and then withdrew a Hundred Treasure Bag from his pocket.The Hundred Treasure Bag was entrusted by Qin Hongmian to Luo Chong to gift to him, and within it were 13 basic body refinement cultivation techniques. The Tiger Subduing Claw, Dragonform Footwork Technique, Great Demon Subduing Palm, and Golden Roc Movement Technique that Chen Xi saw in the Exquisite Pavilion were shockingly all within it. Combined with the Grand Collapsing Fist he\u2019d spent over 100 spirit stones to purchase earlier, there was a total of 14 body refinement martial skills.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help from being extremely elated at obtaining 14 body refinement martial skills within a day, and he impatiently started to carefully read through them.The Tiger Subduing Claw was a martial skill that specialized in tempering the fingers, its moves were swift and vigorous. Its penetrating power was extremely strong, and shattering stones and wood was as easy as breaking dry branches.The Dragonform Footwork Technique was divided into the Sleepy Dragon\u2019s Stroll, Swimming Dragon\u2019s Stride, Violent Dragon\u2019s Stride, Flying Dragon\u2019s Vigorous Stride, White Dragon\u2019s Bizarre Steps, Leaping Dragon\u2019s Prance, Golden Dragon\u2019s Eight Graceful Steps. These divisions respectively aimed at forward steps, forward movements, jumping movements, backwards steps, backwards movements, sideways movements, turning movements, and winding movements. These eight most basic movements were also called the Heavenly Dragon\u2019s Eight Steps, and possessed both offensive and defensive footwork with incomparably marvellous variations.The Great Demon Subduing Palm used the hands to form seals. It possessed vigorous and condensed force, and is even able to condense the force of the vital energy and blood. It caused the hands to be bright red like blood, and was able to increase the might of the palms to explode forth with shocking strength.The Golden Roc Movement Technique was famous for its speed being swift like a bolt of lightning. It was a widely spread lightness technique. When cultivated to a high level, one was able to instantly dodge ten thousand arrows that are shot at one without suffering any injuries.\u2026After reading though a few martial skills in succession, Chen Xi didn\u2019t know how to choose the more he saw, as it seemed that every martial skill was something he needed, and there were none that he disliked.This type of feeling was extremely painful, as if faced with a table full of sumptuous dishes but not knowing where to start.\u201cWhat\u2019re you hesitating about? Let me ask you, what do you want to learn the most?\u201d A voice that contained experience on the vicissitudes of life resounded out within the room, and accompanied by the voice, Ji Yu whose hooves were pitch-black like ink and had a single horn on his head suddenly appeared within the room.\u201cYou\u2019re able to come out?\u201d Chen Xi was extremely shocked.\u201cWho told you that I\u2019m unable to come out? Anyway, this isn\u2019t important. What\u2019s important is what exactly do you want to learn?\u201d Ji Yu lazily shook his head, then a black light flashed and he\u2019d already transformed into a lean faced old man of graceful bearing and a refined demeanour.Chen Xi was stunned, then sunk into deep thought.Ji Yu didn\u2019t disturb him, as the choice of which martial skill to cultivate was related to the level of one\u2019s combat strength. Some people were adept in using swords, some were adept in using sabers, and the crux of the matter was to see if this type of martial skill suited one\u2019s self.After a long time, Chen Xi suddenly said, \u201cI want to learn the martial skill with the strongest offensive ability and the swiftest ability to flee.\u201dJi Yu was startled, then smiled faintly. \u201cYou want to hear my opinion?\u201dChen Xi nodded and openly admitted his thoughts. As far as he was concerned, with the mysterious Ji Yu present, he only needed to mention what he wanted and it would absolutely be not wrong to listen to Ji Yu for the specifics.\u201cYou\u2019re not bad.\u201d Ji Yu gave a rare praise, then his expression went solemn as he said seriously, \u201cThere\u2019s no differentiation between strong and weak in martial skills. To Fiendgod body refiners, offense is embodied within their Divine Ability and cultivation techniques; to qi refiners, if solely in terms of the swiftness and power of offense, then sword techniques are naturally number one.\u201cDivine Abilities are techniques unique to Fiendgod body refiners, like the Heavenly Transformation and Mountain Transforming Fist, they\u2019re all formidable Divine Abilities that possess the might to burn mountains and bloody the seas. Normally, qi refiners are unable to learn this, but this isn\u2019t an absolute, as some experts that possess both the techniques of a body refiner and qi refiner are naturally able to master Divine Abilities.\u201cSimilarly, the techniques and profound arts qi refiners use that utilize True Essence to master \u00a0also have their own terrifying might, and matched with a Magic Treasure or similar weapons, their strengths are not to be taken lightly either.\u201cHowever, there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s used universally, and that\u2019s that regardless of martial skill or method of cultivation, they\u2019re all unable to do without movement techniques. Moreover the utilization of a movement technique\u2019s greatest effect is the ability to easily free yourself from the battlefield and be unlikely to fall into danger.\u201cNow, you know what martial skill you ought to cultivate, right?\u201d\u201cDivine Ability, Sword Technique, Movement Technique!\u201d Chen Xi replied without hesitation. After hearing Ji Yu\u2019s analysis, he was suddenly enlightened on the problem that he\u2019d been entangled with, as if he was filled with wisdom, causing him to instantly understand what he wanted.He was dual cultivating both body refinement and qi refinement, cultivating Divine Abilities in the aspect of body refinement and mainly cultivating Sword Techniques in the aspect of qi refinement, whereas Movement Techniques were instead for protecting his life.Ji Yu nodded and said, \u201cNot bad, but the most important thing for you now is to temper your body\u2019s force exertion skill, as this is the foundation of all cultivation techniques.\u201dAs he spoke, Ji Yu walked over to before Chen Xi, then bent down to pick out the Grand Collapsing Fist from the 14 jade slips.\u201cThese cultivation techniques are really shit, only this cultivation technique is comparatively comprehensive, but it still has quite a few flaws. I\u2019ll help you improve it.\u201d Ji Yu frowned as he judged, then stretched out his finger to touch the jade slip. After a short moment, he raised his hand to toss the jade slip to Chen Xi. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve cultivated this fist technique to the point you\u2019re able to freely control everything, then it\u2019s sufficient for you to control the force exertion skill for every joint in your body.\u201dChen Xi received the jade slip but didn\u2019t hurry to read it, instead he pointed towards the other jade slips on the ground and asked, \u201cWhat about these cultivation techniques? I don\u2019t have to learn them?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re only of little value, it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t cultivate them.\u201d Ji Yu replied extremely decisively.Chen Xi was slightly reluctant, as all these martial skills were gifted to him by Qin Hongmian, and were all the martial skills he possessed up till now. Throwing them away just like this was indeed a slight pity.Most importantly, even though he\u2019d determined the direction of his cultivation, he didn\u2019t have the proper cultivation technique books. When he thought that he still had to spend spirit stones to purchase a Divine Ability, a Sword Technique, and a Movement Technique cultivation technique, he felt a slight headache.Chen Xi\u2019s eyes shone as he raised his head to look at Ji Yu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 - Grand Collapsing FistPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 25 - Grand Collapsing FistJi Yu paid no attention to Chen Xi\u2019s burning gaze and instead casually waved his hand to make an emerald green rattan chair appear beside him. Then, he gestured from his waist and an azure skinned bottle gourd appeared in his hand. A dense wine fragrance floated upwards to fill the room with a fragrant smell.He lazy lay onto the rattan chair then put the bottle gourd to his mouth before gulping down a few mouthfuls of wine and burped, then sighed in satisfaction. \u201cAfter transforming into human form, I\u2019m indeed able to enjoy things I had never enjoyed in the past.\u201d\u201cSenior, you like drinking wine?\u201d Chen Xi asked.\u201cWrong. I like drinking good wine.\u201d Ji Yu corrected, then smiled faintly. \u201cNot only do I like drinking good wine, but I also like eating good food. If you want to bribe me, then do it on these two aspects. The rate of success is extremely high.\u201dChen Xi was extremely ashamed in his heart, yet in his mouth he said, \u201cI just happened to be training in the culinary arts. Even though my skill is inferior to those great spirit chefs, but I dare guarantee I will make dishes that would satisfy you. As for good wine, there\u2019s a wine called Drunken Pine Wine in Pine Mist City, it has a mellow flavor that continuously suffuses out into the mouth, and it\u2019s presumably able to satisfy you as well.\u201dJi Yu wasn\u2019t surprised in the slightest and he nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s precisely because I know your culinary skill is good that I would appear here. It can\u2019t be helped, I had no special addiction while following Master to fight and conquer the world in my lifetime, and I\u2019m only unable to escape the desire for good food.\u201dChen Xi was finally enlightened, but when he thought of how Ji Yu had appeared for the sake of drinking good wine and eating good food and not purely to guide him on martial skills, Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be slightly at a loss of whether to laugh or cry.\u201cSenior Ji Yu, what do you want to eat?\u201d\u201cRoast meat!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Chen Xi stood up and walked over to the various ingredients, then started picking some demon beast meat with a delicious texture.\u201cThe excellence of roast meat is completely contained within the word \u2018freshness.\u2019 The texture of those dead things are not acceptable. I\u2019ll take you to a place.\u201d Ji Yu instantly stood up from the rattan chair when roast meat was mentioned. His gaze was shining as he muttered, then he casually waved his hand. Chen Xi\u2019s vision blurred, and in the next moment, he\u2019d appeared in a dense forest.Chen Xi looked around at his surroundings and said in surprise and bewilderment, \u201cThis is within the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range?\u201dUnder the deeply dark night, numerous large trees were like solemn warriors of ancient times, with sturdy trunks, luxuriant foliages, and spreading branches. Dense creeping vines that were as big as the mouth of a bowl were on the treetops, seeming to be bodies of pythons that were hanging down by their tails. The faraway mountain range that rose and fell could be vaguely seen through the gaps in the leaves and branches.Roar!A burst of beast roars sounded out from afar, adding an extremely dangerous aura to the entire forest.Bang!Ji Yu appeared out of thin air, then casually swung his hand and an Azure Haired Wild Boar that was an entire 500kg fell onto the ground, emitting a terrified and miserable howl of grief.\u201cHurry up and roast the meat.\u201d As he spoke, Ji Yu once again lay on the rattan chair, then he picked up the bottle gourd and drunk down a few mouthfuls of wine. He smacked his lips in satisfaction and had a free and relaxed expression, as if he\u2019d taken the entire extremely dangerous forest that demon beasts wreaked havoc in to be his own backyard.Chen Xi didn\u2019t sigh with emotion anymore and picked up the kitchen knife before starting to prepare the Azure Haired Wild Boar.Hiss hiss!Not long after, a campfire raged, and the oil flowed out from the meat pieces on the roasting rack to drop into the campfire to emit a hissing sound. After that, an enticing meat fragrance that made one\u2019s mouth water suffused out.\u201cMmm, after so many years, I finally get to taste the flavor of roast meat!\u201d Ji Yu couldn\u2019t refrain himself any longer as he scurried off the rattan chair to grab a piece of burning hot roast meat before chewing with large bites, and he still vaguely ceaselessly sighed with emotion.Chen Xi felt extremely happy as well when he saw this, as he didn\u2019t care about the problems of combination of spirit energy when he roasted the Azure Haired Wild Boar this time. He had purely sought after the deliciousness of taste for the sake of satisfying Ji Yu\u2019s taste buds.\u201cStart cultivating your fist technique. Stand in the natural position, and conform your essence, energy, and spirit to the heaven and earth. This is the most suitable way to cultivate fist and kicking skills. Hiding within a room to cultivate is unable to attain this sort of effect.\u201d Ji Yu ate meat and drank wine in great satisfaction, and therefore he didn\u2019t stint in giving Chen Xi some advice.What Chen Xi wanted was precisely this. He found an empty space and sat down cross-legged before carefully learning the Grand Collapsing Fist.Grand Collapsing Fist, basic martial skill, the fist force moves like a drawn bow and explodes out like a thunderclap.\u2018Moving like a drawn bow\u2019 is the process of accumulating strength. The body is like a drawn bow that\u2019s fully accumulated with force that\u2019s transmitted to every joint within the body.\u2018Exploding out like a thunderclap\u2019 is the technique when exerting force, it stresses upon the collapsing force exploding out in an instant and swiftly like thunder. This is also what is called instant force and explosive force. When exerting force, the power is able to destroy anything within its path, and using one\u2019s body as the axis, the fist force is condensed and is able to collapse mountains!Furthermore, this Grand Collapsing Fist had been improved by Ji Yu, and the force exertion technique of the fist force was even more superior. The might of the fist force underwent a qualitative transformation as well and had completely broken away from the domain of basic martial skills to attain the level of high-grade!According to Chen Xi\u2019s understanding, cultivation of martial skills were divided into the basic-stage, advanced-stage, and unity-stage. They respectively corresponded to the low-grade, the intermediate-grade, and the high-grade.Taking the Grand Collapsing Fist for example, it was originally a basic martial skill, and if cultivated to perfection, Chen Xi could merely be said to have mastered the basic-stage in the Martial Dao. If Chen Xi wanted to attain the advanced-stage, then he had to choose an intermediate-grade martial skill to cultivate.However, there was also those people with shocking natural talent that relied on their own comprehension and a basic martial skill to comprehend an even higher stage in the Martial Dao, but these examples very extremely scarce. In the current cultivation world, so long as one\u2019s pocket was full, or perhaps one was within a sect that possesses deep hidden resources and reserves, one was completely able to obtain martial skills of even high grade with the slightest effort.Bang!Right at the moment Chen Xi intended to cultivate, Ji Yu called him over before a rock, then he struck his fist onto the rock, and the hard rock instantly transformed into a lump of small bits of rubble. The size of the rubble was like a longan, and their shapes were exactly similar. As they scattered onto the ground, they seemed like a pile of beads.\u201cThis is the first stage of the Grand Collapsing Fist, collapsing a rock into beads.\u201dJi Yu once again arrived before a rock and struck out with his fist, the rock instantly transformed into a pile of powder, then lightly blew at it and the powder drifted out profusely and disorderly before naturally vanishing.\u201cThis is the second stage of the Grand Collapsing Fist, collapsing a rock into powder.\u201dJi Yu once again arrived before a rock and struck out with his fist, and with a bang, the rock transformed into sharp rock needles that covered the sky, then he waved his sleeve and the myriad of stone needles emitted an ear piercing whistle from tearing through the air, and hit a nearby large tree, instantly penetrating through to cause countless small needle punctures!\u201cThis is the third stage of the Grand Collapsing Fist, collapsing a rock into needles.\u201d\u201cNow, your soul is growing stronger with each passing day, it ought to not be difficult to cultivate this. If you\u2019re able to cultivate the Grand Collapsing Fist to attain the third stage, the nimbleness and force exertion technique of your body should be sufficient to cultivate Divine Abilities, Sword Techniques, and Movement Techniques.\u201d After he finished speaking, Ji Yu once again lay on the rattan chair, eating meat and drinking wine in delight, and didn\u2019t even glance a Chen Xi again.Whereas Chen Xi had long since been stimulated by the might of the three successive fist strikes of Ji Yu to the point he was full of excitement, his entire body filled with fighting spirit. When he heard Ji Yu, he didn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest as he assumed a stance and started cultivating from the beginning.Just like Ji Yu had said, Chen Xi\u2019s soul was strengthening and growing at a terrifying speed from visualizing the Fuxi Divine Statue all day and night. Under these circumstances, the changes within every move and every form of the Grand Collapsing Fist were like a gurgling stream as it flowed into his mind vividly and without error.It wasn\u2019t long before Chen Xi was immersed within cultivating his fist technique, forgetting himself and everything around him.The sound of blood violently flowing within Chen Xi\u2019s body faintly sounded out, like a great river. But contrary to his blood, his heartbeat grew slower and slower, but was extremely strong. The thumping sounds seemed like the sound of pounding on drums, and it shook the flesh, blood, and skin throughout his body.Swoosh!Chen Xi didn\u2019t notice that right when he was immersed within the fist technique, an azure star amongst that myriad of stars in the sky above him poured down numerous chilly Flexible Waterstar baleful qi that were like stream as it poured into his flesh, blood, and skin to slowly knead the tendons in his entire body\u2026Chen Xi suddenly opened his eyes three hours later and his figure leaped out before striking his fist onto a rock.Bang!The rock was hard like steel, only a few cracks split open on its surface, and a large amount of rubble fell off.\u201cWhat a hard rock. But the force of my fist has obviously increased as well. According to this speed, I ought to be able to attain the first stage, collapsing a rock into beads, within seven days.\u201dChen Xi withdrew his fist, and as he felt the roaring sounds of his blood that seemed to be boiling throughout his body and the tendons in his body that were flexible and white like jade, he felt another burst of pleasant surprise. \u201cI never imagined that the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Technique would actually break through the third level in such a short amount of time to advance to the fourth level, tempering the muscles with earth!\u201dThe slow advancement of his body refinement cultivation had always been a knot in Chen Xi\u2019s heart. Because he didn\u2019t have a shred of experience before, he only purely cultivated the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Technique, but utterly never thought of using other methods to help his body speed up his advancement. The benefits that cultivating the Grand Collapsing Fist brought to him at this moment had undoubtedly allowed him to have found a way to quickly temper his body.\u201cThe principle is extremely simple, this is the beauty of martial skills. It can both strengthen the cultivation in the Martial Dao, nourish the body in return and use the circulation of cultivation within the body to draw upon the baleful qi of the universe to temper the physique.\u201d Ji Yu raised his head and said indifferently.Rumble!Chen Xi\u2019s stomach growled in hunger. Cultivating the fist technique earlier had already completely spent all the excess energy in his body. There was a little less than a half of the Azure Haired Wild Boar still remaining, and Chen Xi couldn\u2019t care about anything else as he sat cross-legged and started swallowing with large bites.\u201cDrink wine!\u201d Ji Yu raised his hand and threw the azure skinned bottle gourd to Chen Xi.Chen Xi didn\u2019t treat Ji Yu as a stranger in the slightest as he held the azure skinned bottle gourd and fiercely drank a few mouthfuls. The pungent wine transformed into a mellow and refreshing hot stream the instant it entered his throat, then surged into every corner of his body.Bang!It was as if a stone had exploded within his body, and vast pure energy roared out as it collided within his entire body, like numerous steel brushes that washed his blood, flesh, skin, and internal organs over and over again.Chen Xi\u2019s face instantly flushed red, and intense pain struck his entire body, causing his features to become distorted and terrifying.\u201cI forgot that the energy within this wine is too terrifying, and isn\u2019t suitable for him to drink.\u201d Ji Yu was slightly startled, then he slapped his forehead before shouting out explosively. \u201cCirculate your cultivation technique, keep your mind clear and maintain consciousness!\u201dChen Xi didn\u2019t dare hesitate, and he gritted his teeth as he circulated his cultivation.Bang! Bang!It felt like there were countless raging bulls colliding within his blood, flesh, and skin. This vast energy that the strong wine transformed into was extremely violent and hard to tame, moreover it was scorching hot and difficult to endure. Chen Xi completely relied on his supreme will to completely absorb all this energy many hours later.At this moment, it was just before the crack of dawn.When Chen Xi stood up, the first ray of dawn passed through the dense leaves and branches to pour down.He had a firm face that was very thin and a tall figure, and a layer of gentle lustre like jade arose on the pieces of clearly angular muscles underneath his clothes.Under the shower of morning light, Chen Xi seemed to have been reborn, and didn\u2019t possess his frail appearance from before anymore.Chen Xi felt the changes in his body and his heart fiercely shook.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - Redleaf InstitutionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26 - Redleaf InstitutionOne month later.Deep in the night within the forest of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range.Chen Xi had a concentrated expression, and a white light suffused on his fist as he struck a rock.Bang!The hard rock that was the size of a millstone burst open and sprayed out before dropping all over the ground. It could be clearly seen that the rubble were each similarly the size of a longan and were all like beads.At this moment, Chen Xi had shockingly already attained the first level of the Grand Collapsing Fist \u2014 collapsing a rock into beads!\u201cSo it turns out that collapsing force exploding out in an instant is exerted through instantly condensing the hidden force that\u2019s accumulated from twisting, winding, and kneading the muscles. The body is like a fully drawn bow and the fist is like an arrow that\u2019s pulled extremely tightly, and at the moment that force is exerted, it\u2019s precisely what is called \u2018collapse\u2019!\u201d Chen Xi muttered to himself, then once again assumed the stance and cultivated every move and form.During this half a month\u2019s time, his life was monotonous yet substantial. During the day, he explored his culinary arts in the Quiet Room; at night, he followed Ji Yu to this forest to cultivate the Grand Collapsing Fist, while paying attention to meditation, tempering the body, and visualizing the Fuxi Divine Statue. Every single moment of time was fully utilized by him.Under such a heavy load of bitter cultivation, changes silently occurred in Chen Xi\u2019s imposing manner. He was full of spirit between his brows and he was like a treasured sword, concealing a sharp aura of slaughter within. The muscles of his entire body had line by line and piece by piece become even more clearly angular, and a jade-like lustre was suffused on the surface as if boundless energy was contained within.Bang! Bang! Bang!His fist tore through the sky and emitted a low and sharp sound of rending the air. This was the sound of the vibration in the air caused by the strength within the muscles being condensed to a certain degree.When this type of vibration attained a certain degree, it would have already attainted the second level of the Grand Collapsing Fist \u2014 collapsing a rock into powder. At that time, with a fist strike onto the rock, the shattered bits would be like powder and would scatter with the wind.Sweat wound down his body and heavy gasps for breath were mixed with surges of howling wind from striking out with the fist, and it resounded for a long time in the air above the forest.Six hours later.Chen Xi fell flat on his back onto the ground, terribly fatigued. Every muscle in his body was aching and weak, and he was unwilling to even move a finger.\u201cSenior Ji Yu, my qi refinement cultivation has attained the 8th level of the Congenital Realm now, and my body refinement cultivation has already advanced to the Congenital Realm. According to this momentum, when do you think I can attain the Violet Palace Realm?\u201d Chen Xi turned his head to gaze at Ji Yu who lay on the rattan chair and asked in a light voice.Ji Yu was same as always, eating meat and drinking wine as he answered, \u201cAt least a year. Regardless of if it\u2019s the school of fiendgod body refinement or the school of qi refinement, developing the Violet Palace is an extremely difficult barrier. Your cultivation has already advanced swiftly enough, you don\u2019t have to cultivate so desperately.\u201dChen Xi sighed. \u201cI have too many enemies. If I don\u2019t cultivate desperately, how would I become strong?\u201dJi Yu replied with an \u2018oh,\u2019 then raised the bottle gourd of wine in his hand and asked, \u201cDo you want to have a drink?\u201dChen Xi repeatedly shook his head. \u201cNo. The energy contained within the wine is too terrifying. Even if it\u2019s able to be used by me, it caused me to be unable to cultivate my fist technique for seven days. Moreover, the explosive increase in cultivation was of no benefit towards my training, so it doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t drink it.\u201dThe facts were indeed like this, since drinking a few mouthfuls of the strong wine within the bottle gourd half a month ago, although Chen Xi\u2019s body refinement cultivation had broken through to the Congenital Realm in one go, the side-effects were extremely obvious as well. The explosive increase in his strength caused him to be unable to skilfully and easily use his body. For the sake of avoiding the state of his foundation being unstable, he spent another half a month worth of time to draw upon the Thick Earthstar baleful qi and Pure Woodstar baleful qi to temper his body once again, and the arduousness of the process caused Chen Xi to have a lingering fear in his heart.Ji Yu said rather regretfully, \u201cIt\u2019s indeed like you\u2019ve said, drawing upon the assistance of external forces to break through in your cultivation is the easiest way to cause the condition of your foundation to be unstable. And this would cause you to easily suffer qi deviation when charging towards a higher Realm in the future. However, once you\u2019ve attained the Violet Palace Realm and have established your Dao Foundation, then you don\u2019t have to worry about the appearance of these problems.\u201dActually the principle was extremely simple and Chen Xi understood it as well. Before developing the Violet Palace, regardless if it was the Postnatal Realm or the Congenital Realm, they were both there for the sake of preparing for establishing the Dao Foundation. Only when the Dao Foundation was strong and firm would he be able to go further on the path of cultivation. Even though using the assistance of external forces would allow his cultivation to advance swiftly, compared to the future journey towards the Dao, it was obviously of more harm than benefit.\u201cActually, if you want to increase your strength, live battle is undoubtedly the best choice.\u201d Ji Yu suddenly spoke, then slowly said, \u201cThe abundance of experience in live battle will be of great important while facing an enemy. An expert that was tempered through life and death battles would even be able to challenge an opponent of a higher cultivation than himself.\u201dThe attainment in cultivation didn\u2019t represent that one was able to utilize this strength.Possessing profound martial skills, but having never experienced the tempering of blood and fire would only amount to fancy fighting.Chen Xi deeply agreed.\u201cNumerous demon beasts walk about within this mountain range\u2019s forest, and the deeper you go, the stronger the demon beasts will be. There\u2019s no lack of greater demons with formidable strength within the forest, but with your current strength, it\u2019s better for you to look for some Congenital Realm demon beasts to train with.\u201d Ji Yu pointed towards the depths of the forest as he suggested.After a wild beast possessed intelligence, it would be able to swallow and absorb the spirit energy of heaven and earth to transform into a demon beast. After going through arduous cultivation, it would be able to step into the Congenital Realm like humans and continue to step onto the path to seek immortality.According to the difference in bloodlines, demon beasts were normally divided into demon beasts and divine beasts.When ordinary demon beasts cultivated to the Congenital Realm, they were able to freely take human form, whereas it was extremely difficult for divine beasts to take human form. Some divine beasts needed to attain the Violet Palace Realm to be able to take human form, some instead needed to attain the Golden Realm, and some even required an even higher\u2026However, divine beasts possessed the bloodline of primordial demons and they were born possessing intelligence and extremely high natural talent. Their strength was much more formidable than ordinary demon beasts.\u201cFight and kill a Congenital Realm greater demon? I seem to have not seen one during all these days?\u201d Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be startled. Battling a demon beast was no different than battling a human, and on the contrary, the imposing manner of a demon beast usually surpasses humans. Among demon beasts, a Congenital Realm greater demon that occupied a territory of its own would surely have slowly risen up from killing and battles. With the level and viciousness of its combat experience, it would usually be able to terrify its opponent to the point that their scalp went numb with a single glance, causing its opponent to be only able to exert 50% of their strength.Ji Yu smiled then asked in response, \u201cThey dare come close to here?\u201d His casual tone revealed boundless contempt.Chen Xi came to a sudden understanding, he\u2019d nearly forgotten that Ji Yu was the spirit of the manor that had lived for a million years, and his appearance is that of a Qilin with jet-black hooves and a single horn on his head. If those demon beasts dared to come close, they would simply be looking to be bashed!Chen Xi didn\u2019t say anything further and waited for his physical strength to recover before tidying up his clothes and directly moving towards the depths of the forest.Under the night sky, the forest was extremely dark and unusually silent. After moving forward for the time it took an incense stick to burn, Chen Xi encountered a demon beast with a strength that was barely at the initial-stage of the Postnatal Realm.However, Chen Xi instead became cautious, as ordinary Congenital Realm cultivators didn\u2019t dare enter a dangerous place like this and a slight carelessness on his part might lead to suffering a sneak attack and dying from these ferocious and cunning demon beats.He gradually moved deeper and deeper, killing a few more demon beasts on the way. Unfortunately, the strength of these demon beasts were weak and couldn\u2019t arouse his interest in the slightest.He once again moved forward a few kilometres, then Chen Xi suddenly stopped in his tracks and a trace of surprise flashed at the bottom of his eyes.\u201cThere\u2019s sounds of fighting!\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s soul was much stronger than an ordinary cultivator with the same cultivation as him, and it was already faintly arriving at the verge of breaking through. This also allowed him to be able to catch movements that ordinary people were unable to notice.At this moment, he\u2019d precisely relied on the strength of his soul to hear the vague sounds of battle that resounded out from far away.He never imagined that there actually would still be people that dared to enter deep within this mountain forest late at night\u2026 Chen Xi followed the sound and silently rushed over.Up ahead was a seemingly empty pile of rocks. Borrowing the starlight from above, he was vaguely able to see some figures flashing about, and besides this there were sounds of frightening beast roars.When he was still 100 steps away from the rock pile, Chen Xi took a breath then leapt up onto a large tree before hiding himself within the crown of the tree to get a good vantage point to clearly see the faraway scene.In the empty space at the centre of the rock pile, it was a complete mess, and at this moment, two men and a woman were waving about the weapons in their hands as they jointly attacked an enormous demon beast.This demon beast was shaped like a tiger or leopard with a body that was over 7 meters long. Its fur was like silver and its limbs were thick and strong like poles. Sharp fangs that were the shape of saws filled its entire bloody mouth, and its claws were 1 meter long and sharp like knives.This was an adult Silverwind Leopard with a strength comparable to the perfection stage in the Postnatal Realm. Its sharp claws were like knives and its speed was extremely swift like the wind, and it was extremely skilled in stealth and sneak attacks. What caused people to feel terror the most was that the sharp claws of the Silverwind Leopard carried a toxic poison, and if an infected person wasn\u2019t treated in time the meridians in the person\u2019s body would burn into nothingness and the person would become a cripple.Chen Xi noticed the red leaf design on the sleeves of the three people, and the name of an inferior institution appeared within his mind \u2014 Redleaf Institution.Redleaf Institution was situated within the institution district in Pine Mist City; it closely neighbored Skystar Institution and had 300 plus disciples. Amongst the numerous institutions, its strength was able to be ranked amongst the top ten.What caused people to delight in talking about the most was the Redleaf Institution's Dean Ye Qiu, who cultivated the Dao with a saber. The Redleaf Saber Technique he created was straightforward and simple, and it used simple moves to defeat skilful moves. According to the differentiation of grades, it could already be called a high-grade martial skill. Supposedly, the strength of Ye Qiu was formidable enough to the extent he was even able to battle the number one expert under the command of the General\u2019s Estate, Luo Chong.The strength of the three people that were jointly attacking the Silverwind Leopard wasn\u2019t high, but their cooperation was quite tacit, and they ought to have cultivated a type of combination attack arts. The three sabers splashed out like the rain, seeming to weave an impenetrable saber net that firmly trapped the Silverwind Leopard into a corner, to the point it would only be able to struggle and wait for death.\u201cCourting death!\u201d The blue clothed young man that stood in the middle suddenly shouted out explosively when he saw the Silverwind Leopard wanting to strike regardless of if it was injured, he quickly swung out three saber strikes that whistled in the air, and the swift and fierce saber energy forced the Silverwind Leopard to retreat.His companions by his side took advantage of this opportunity to suddenly launch an attack without the slightest hesitation, and the shiny and sharp saber lights were like rain droplets as they chopped towards the Silverwind Leopard.Behind it was the hard rocks that stood tall and erect, thus it had no path of retreat.When he saw the Silverwind Leopard about to be killed on the spot, Chen Xi who was concealed atop the tree crown instead perceived that something was off.How strong was Chen Xi\u2019s soul? At the instant he perceived something was not right, he\u2019d quickly noticed that within the shadows surrounding the rocks, ten plus robust beast figures were silently approaching\u2026Roar! Roar! Roar!The sounds of 10 plus beast roars mixed together was like the horn of attack, resounding out within the dense night sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Junior Brother Qu, Junior Sister Duan, watch out around you!\u201d The blue clothed young man\u2019s face went pale when he heard the continuous sounds of beast roars that rose and fell, and he stopped attacking the Silverwind Leopard before assuming a defensive posture with his saber before his chest as he carefully prepared himself.At practically the moment the blue clothed young man finished speaking, the other man and woman successively stopped their attacks before gathering by the blue clothed young man\u2019s side, and their faces were already horrified.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Accompanied by the beast roars that resounded out, ten plus Silverwind Leopards appeared around the rock pile, completely surrounding the three of them in a right ring.Roar!The Silverwind Leopard that was nearly forced to a corner and killed walked unhurriedly with an even pace to stand within the group of beasts, then it faced the three of them as it emitted a complacent roar.\u201cDammit! I never expected we would fall into this dirty beast\u2019s ambush!\u201d The blue clothed young man\u2019s expression was exceedingly unsightly. When faced with this scene, how could he not guess that the Silverwind Leopard from earlier was only bait, and it wanted to bait the three of them to here?The other man had a round face and small eyes, and immaturity was contained between his brows, as he asked with a terrified and trembling voice, \u201cSenior Brother Lu, what should\u2026 What should we do?\u201dA single Silverwind Leopard\u2019s strength was comparable to the perfection-stage in the Postnatal Realm, and at this moment, there were over 10 Silverwind Leopards around them. With their cultivations, they didn\u2019t have the slightest chance at victory.\u201cWhat else can we do? We have already been completely surrounded by these dirty beasts. It\u2019s utterly impossible for us to flee.\u201d Senior Brother Lu replied with a calm expression. He was similarly extremely anxious in his heart, as they were within the forest of a southern barbaric mountain and it was even deep within the night. Thus, it was impossible for them to seek help.\u201cSenior Brother Lu, Senior Brother Qu, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s all because of me. If it wasn\u2019t for the sake of obtaining the skin, fur, and sharp claws of the Silverwind Leopard for me, the two of you wouldn\u2019t encounter such danger. I\u2019ll draw them away later, and you two seize the opportunity to flee.\u201d The nearby young woman was delicate and pretty, yet thin and weak. As she spoke, tears welled within her eyes, and her expression was extremely remorseful and regretful.\u201cJunior Sister Duan, don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d Senior Brother Lu shouted out explosively, then he raised the long saber in his hand and said coldly, \u201cWe\u2019ll attack together. Killing one beast is one beast. Even if we die, we will die together.\u201d\u201cRight! The Dean always says that if you only think about fleeing when faced with danger, then you won\u2019t be able to become a true saber cultivator throughout your lifetime. I support Senior Brother Lu!\u201d Junior Brother Qu gnashed his teeth as he spoke, the terror on his face disappeared, and his immature round face was filled with a firm and vicious expression.\u201cSenior Brother\u2026\u201d \u00a0Junior Sister Duan began to speak but stopped. She was moved to the point she was unable to speak.\u201cKill!\u201d Senior Brother Lu lightly smiled, he glanced the Junior Brother and Junior Sister beside him, and then his face revealed dense killing intent as he shouted out explosively with the long saber in his hand, attacking the Silverwind Leopards first!\u201cKill!\u201d Junior Brother Qu and Junior Sister Duan followed right behind him, holding their long sabers tightly with surging battle intent.Roar!The ten plus Silverwind Leopards moved out when they saw their prey still wanting to put up a last struggle, and their robust figures flashed past the night sky as they brandished their one meter long sharp claws to pounce towards the Senior Brother Lu\u2019s group of three.\u201cThese three people are in danger\u2026\u201d Chen Xi silently watched the faraway battle, and as he watched the three Redleaf Institution disciples that were like straw as they struggled bitterly within the group of beasts, he extremely admired the three of them for their courage and camaraderie to not abandon one another.Ah!A shrill cry of pain sounded out, as a Silverwind Leopard had seized an opportunity during the gaps in his defense, and its sharp claw fiercely tore open two deep wounds on Junior Brother Qu\u2019s chest.\u201cJunior Brother Qu!\u201d Senior Brother Lu shouted out explosively. He wanted to save Junior Brother Qu, but the three Silverwind Leopards before him were constantly harassing him, causing him to be unable to free himself, and his face distorted from rage and gloominess.\u201cSenior Brother Qu, quickly leave with Senior Brother Lu!\u201d Senior Brother Lu saw Junior Brother Qu was about to be killed by the Silverwind Leopard, but he heard a delicate shout and Junior Sister Duan disregarded the attack in front of her as she turned around to swing her saber at the Silverwind Leopard beside Junior Brother Qu.When Senior Brother Lu saw Junior Sister Duan disregarding her own safety to go save Junior Brother Qu, his face couldn\u2019t help but go pale and he cried out involuntarily in alarm, \u201cJunior Sister!\u201dWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Three Silverwind Leopards seized this chance to rush over, and their sharp claws fiercely clawed towards Junior Sister Duan from behind.\u201cSenior Brothers, I still want to be your Junior Sister in my next life\u2026\u201d Junior Sister Duan knew that death was at hand, and she slowly closed her eyes.\u201cJunior Sister!\u201d\u201cJunior Sister!\u201dThe furious roars of her two Senior Brothers entered her ears, it caused her to feel happy yet sad, and she said in her heart, \u201cI wonder when I can hear their voice again\u2026\u201dBang! Bang! Bang!A burst of heavy and dull sounds suddenly echoed out, like a 500kg sandbag had fallen from the sky to smash down onto the ground, and there were miserable beast howls mixed within.Junior Sister Duan opened her eyes in complete bewilderment, and when she saw the scene before her, she instead felt that she was dreaming.Suddenly, an unfamiliar youth stood before her. The youth had a thin and tall figure, and a handsome and firm face. He silently stood there seeming like an immovable mountain, causing one to be unable to help from feeling safe and at ease.Three miserable Silverwind Leopards that were howling in grief were shockingly beneath the youth\u2019s feet.The youth was precisely Chen Xi, and the reason he saved them was extremely simple. While atop the three, when he saw that Junior Sister Duan willing to give up her life to save her comrade, he was extremely moved by this camaraderie that was strong as metal and stone. How could he watch on and see her die beneath the sharp claws of the Silverwind Leopard?\u201cThe Grand Collapsing Fist is formidable as expected. With my current strength, I\u2019m completely capable of killing this group of Silverwind Leopards by myself!\u201dBefore he attacked, Chen Xi had never thought that he would only need three punches to shatter all the bones in the three Silverwind Leopard\u2019s bodies. At this moment, when he gazed at the three Silverwind Leopards that had lost their ability to fight, strong confidence couldn\u2019t help but be aroused within his heart.Roar!Chen Xi\u2019s sudden appearance caused the attacks of the Silverwind Leopard group to cease for a short moment. When they saw their companions howling miserably while lying on the floor and unable to stand up, the ferociousness of these Silverwind Leopard\u2019s were completely stirred, and they abandoned their opponents to howl as they dashed towards Chen Xi.Killing intent flashed within Chen Xi\u2019s eyes, and his figure swayed before rushing straight at them.Bang!Body like a bow, fist like an arrow, Chen Xi struck out with his fist and strong winds howled out in all directions. A Silverwind Leopard was like a ball that was slapped flying with a rod, fiercely smashing deep into a rock 30 over meters away and was unable to stand up again.Chen Xi didn\u2019t stop for a moment after successfully using a single move to deal with a Silverwind Leopard, then he leaned to the side and bent his waist to dodge the attack that pounced at him from the front. His right elbow shot out like lightning to fiercely strike his fist onto the abdomen of his attacker.Pu!His arm directly went through the stomach of the Silverwind Leopard, breaking upon a bloody hole the size of a bowl, and internal organs that were covered in blood splashed and flowed down.Chen Xi waved his hand to toss the corpse away before once again pouncing at another Silverwind Leopard.At this moment, battle intent surged in Chen Xi\u2019s chest. After his Grand Collapsing Fist had attained the first level, collapsing a rock into beads, his two fists were contained the twofold strength of both his body and True Essence, and were simply like two 150,000kg axe hammers. So long as a Silverwind Leopard was struck, the bones in its entire body would shattered and it would die on the spot.The more Chen Xi fought, the more exhilarated he felt. Earlier, he\u2019d always been cultivating by himself and the method of testing his strength was to use his fist to shatter a rock. How could it compare to being surrounded by dangerous attacks that could take his life, allowing him to release all his strength without holding back in the slightest?This sort of feeling was like meeting his match. His battle intent ceaselessly rose, the more he fought, the more ferocious he became. He tempered the nimble and swift Grand Collapsing Fist and became even more proficient and skilled with it.The three Redleaf Institution disciples had gathered together, as with the addition of Chen Xi, the pressure upon them instantly lowered greatly, even to the extent they were completely unable to interfere and could only obediently stand aside. At this moment, Junior Brother Qu couldn\u2019t help but let out heartfelt praise as he gazed at Chen Xi who was like a war god under the shroud of night, skilfully and easily killing the Silverwind Leopards successively. \u201cSo formidable! Is that the Grand Collapsing Fist?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s indeed the Grand Collapsing Fist, but it seems to be even more simple and effective than the moves of an ordinary Grand Collapsing Fist. Not only has the strength increased a level, but even the might of it is extremely shocking.\u201d Senior Brother Lu had extremely sharp judgment, but with his cultivation, he was still unable to see through the profundity of Chen Xi\u2019s fist technique. Even so, he still couldn\u2019t help admire in his heart and he vaguely felt that Chen Xi\u2019s fist technique ought to enter the advanced-stage very soon.What caused Senior Brother Lu to be bewildered was that the youth\u2019s cultivation seemed to have not attained the level capable of developing the Violet Palace.\u201cI wonder who this fellow is? Why have I never heard of a figure as formidable as him within the younger generation of our Pine Mist City?\u201d Junior Brother Qu exclaimed with admiration as he cleaned the injuries on his chest.\u201cHmph, what fellow? Mind your words Senior Brother Qu, this Senior saved our lives.\u201d Junior Sister Duan fiercely glared at Junior Brother Qu.Senior Brother Lu cracked a smile.Within the cultivation world, so long as one had developed the Violet Palace and established the Dao Foundation, not only would one\u2019s appearance not change anymore, even their lifespan would attain a qualitative leap. Some great cultivators were able to live for at least a few hundred years, and some were even able to live for thousands of years. So, when faced with an unfamiliar cultivator that possessed a higher cultivations, people would ordinarily call the unfamiliar cultivator as \u2018Senior.\u2019Bang!Chen Xi struck the last Silverwind Leopard flying, then he looked around and saw the ground filled with corpses. He smacked his lips in dissatisfaction before turning around, intending to leave.The strongest amongst these Silverwind Leopards only possessed a strength at the perfection-stage of the Postnatal Realm and were already unable to satisfy his combat needs. Moreover, it was only six hours before dawn, and dawn would also mean that he would once again return to the Quiet Room to train in the culinary arts. So he had to make the best use of his time and seek out a true Congenital Realm greater demon to temper his live combat experience.\u201cFellow Daoist, please wait.\u201d The lives of himself and his Junior Sister and Junior Brother had been saved. Senior Brother Lu wouldn\u2019t watch on as their savior left, so he hurriedly chased him.Lu Shaocong walked forward and said respectfully, \u201cI\u2019m the Redleaf Institution\u2019s Lu Shaocong, this is my Junior Brother Qu Cheng and Junior Sister Duan Ying. Thank you Fellow Daoist for saving my life. May I ask for Fellow Daoist\u2019s name, and where do you live? I will surely return the favor with lavish gifts once we return to Pine Mist City.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need. I only lifted a finger. Demon beasts roam without restraint within this southern barbaric mountain\u2019s forest, all of you should leave as early as possible.\u201d Chen Xi shook his head, but was unwilling to reveal his identity, then he walked off.Lu Shaocong\u2019s group of three were dumbstruck, and seeing that Chen Xi was gradually going further and was about to disappear on the shroud of the night sky, Duan Ying suddenly said, \u201cSenior, are you heading to the Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area to hunt some greater demons? I have a map here, perhaps it would be of use to you.\u201dChen Xi was stunned and abruptly stopped his footsteps.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28 - Violet Rhino Greater DemonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28 - Violet Rhino Greater DemonForbidden area meant that it was forbidden to enter!In the cultivation world, an existence that\u2019s able to be called a forbidden area was usually a place that\u2019s extremely dangerous.The Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area was exactly so.To the cultivators of Pine Mist City, not only were there various extremely terrifying greater demons living within that entire 50,000 km area of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, even the living environment was dangerous and complex. It was like a battlefield that devils roamed about freely within, and was completely not a place that a cultivator would step into with guts alone.The Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area was situated deep within the 100,000 huge mountains in the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range.Chen Xi had been living in Pine Mist City since he was young and had once heard of the rumors about the Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area. At this moment, when he heard that he would enter the Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area if he headed a little deeper, he naturally didn\u2019t dare rashly move forward.He was still able to guarantee the safety of his life if he hunted and killed demon beasts at the outer area of the southern barbaric mountains, but if he were to enter the forbidden area where greater demons roamed unrestrained, it would probably not be such a simple matter.However, the map Duan Ying mentioned gave Chen Xi a reminder; if he possessed a map of the Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area, he would completely be capable of circumnavigating those dangerous place to avoid the places those terrifying greater demons stayed, and seek his intended target.Duan Ying hurriedly chased up to Chen Xi when she saw him stop, then said respectfully, \u201cSenior, the only reason the three of us dared to venture here was because I have a map that was handed down by my ancestors in my possession. It annotates in detail the geographical environment and distribution of demon beasts within the Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area. If you\u2019re unfamiliar towards this place, I can help show you the way.\u201dChen Xi was originally curious as to why these three people whose cultivation was only around the perfection-stage of the Postnatal Realm would actually be so brave as to dare hunt Silverwind Leopards within the southern barbaric mountain\u2019s forest at night. Now, he was suddenly enlightened when heard about the map Duan Ying spoke of.\u201cI want to hunt a Congenital Realm greater demon.\u201d Chen Xi said truthfully, as he wanted to hear Duan Ying\u2019s opinion.Lu Shaocong, Qu Cheng, and Duan Ying all let out a breath of cold air and were extremely shocked.Compared to Congenital Realm cultivators, demon beasts that had experienced countless years of tempering to advance to the Congenital Realm were not only able to take human form, but also usually had cultivations that were much deeper and more solid than cultivators. Coupled with the baptism of slaughter all through their lives, a Congenital Realm greater demon was completely capable of dominating a cultivator of the same cultivation, and were really extremely formidable.And it was precisely because of this that when they heard Chen Xi wanted to hunt and kill a Congenital Realm greater demon all by himself, the shock in their hearts was imaginable.\u201cSenior, there\u2019s a place called Spiritcave Lake at the outer area of the forbidden area, and a two-headed Violet Rhino greater demon that possesses a strength of around the initial-stage of the Congenital Realm occupies that place. Its skin and bones are as if made from steel, and it possesses boundless strength and shocking defense, but isn\u2019t good at speed. If you want to hunt and kill a Congenital Realm greater demon, then this two-headed Violet Rhino greater demon is extremely suitable.\u201dDuan Yin withdrew a jade slip and looked through it a little, then a trace of excitement appeared on her delicate and pretty face as she swiftly said, \u201cEven if you\u2019re unable to defeat it, you can still safely flee.\u201dChen Xi pondered for a moment and directly asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the location?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take you!\u201dDuan Ying had a resolute expression as she said, \u201cThe three of us have all attained the perfection-stage of the Postnatal Realm. On one hand, we came to the southern barbaric mountain\u2019s forest this time to collect the sharp claws, fur and skin of the Silverwind Leopard; and on the other hand, we also hope to be able to temper our strength through hunting and killing demon beasts, as we aspire to be able to break through to the Congenital Realm.\u201d\u201cSenior, don\u2019t refuse straight away.\u201d Duan Ying didn\u2019t wait for Chen Xi to speak as she continued. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Senior. The three of us won\u2019t interfere in Senior\u2019s actions. On the contrary, if Senior encounters some danger, we can help as well. We only ask that Senior is able to allow us to witness a battle of the Congenital Realm.\u201dChen Xi was in a difficult position, if he took the three of them, Chen Xi would still need to take care of them in the event that they encountered danger, and it was very exhausting. If he were to not agree, he didn\u2019t know the location of Spiritcave Lake, and if he were to blindly search for it, he might counter a terrifying greater demon and it was extremely not worthwhile.\u201cSenior, take us along, leave life and death to fate. If we really encounter danger that we\u2019re unable to withstand, then Senior doesn\u2019t have to trouble yourself for us.\u201d\u201cYeah, Senior, take us along.\u201dLu Shaocong and Qu Cheng changed the way they addressed Chen Xi, and looked at Chen Xi with eager eyes.Even though he thought like this, but a trace of enlightenment silently slipped through his heart.In the end, Chen Xi agreed to the three of them joining him.Lu Shaocong\u2019s group of three were extremely excited, they intended to share with Chen Xi some of the sharp claws, fur, and skin removed from the 10 plus Silverwind Leopard corpses on the ground, but were refused by him with a shake of his head. The sharp claws, fur, and skin were of no use to him, and bringing it along would only be a burden to him.After the time for an incense stick to burn, Chen Xi\u2019s group felt alarmed on the way but still safely arrived at a low hill.\u201cSenior, please look.\u201d Duan Ying pointed ahead. \u201cSpiritcave Lake is over there.\u201dChen Xi looked into the distance and saw a vast and boundless great lake that rippled peacefully 5km in the distance. Under the rays of dazzling star light from the night sky, a dreamlike hue appeared atop the lake.The nighttime fog curled upwards where numerous demon beasts of various forms could be vaguely seen swimming about the luxuriant aquatic plants, and a bird with wings that were 30 meters wide glided atop the lake. This was the world of demon beasts!Chen Xi thought to himself.\u201cSenior, the two-headed Violet Rhino stays at the bottom of the lake, at the center.\u201d Duan Ying explained in a low voice and with an even more respectful manner.On their way here, although she had a map in her possession, they still encountered numerous attacks from demon beasts. The strength of these demon beasts weren\u2019t strong, but they were all adept in concealing themselves and launching sneak attacks. If it wasn\u2019t for Chen Xi consistently being able to notice them beforehand and killing these demon beasts on the spot; if solely relying on the three of them, it would be absolutely impossible for them to arrive here safely.\u201cIt\u2019s relatively safer here. You three wait here.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s formidable soul swept the surroundings, and he didn\u2019t notice the tracks of any demon beasts.\u201cOkay.\u201d Even though they were unwilling, Lu Shaocong\u2019s group of three could only respectfully comply. They knew that if they approached Spiritcave Lake with their strengths, it was essentially courting death.Whoosh!The tip of Chen Xi\u2019s foot touched the ground, his body was like an arrow that left the bow as he swiftly flashed down the hill and dashed towards Spiritcave Lake that was 5 km away.The vast Spiritcave Lake seemed boundless and the abundant water vapor contained dense spirit energy of the heaven and earth. If it wasn\u2019t for the demon beasts that could be seen everywhere, this place would simply be like a Blessed Immortal Ground.After a short moment, Chen Xi arrived by the lake and stopped to gaze into the distance.His formidable soul\u2019s energy surged out like a large net to slowly search the surface of the lake.Splash! Splash! Splash!The demon beasts and aquatic animals that swam nearby seemed to have noticed something as they were alarmed to the point that they raised their heads to look around, then they instantly fled in fright and vanished.\u201cThe strength of my soul is only able to search an area of few tens of kilometers with difficulty. This Spiritcave Lake just had to be so big, if I continue searching like this, I\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to find that two-headed Violent Rhino even until dawn\u2026 Hmmm?\u201dChen Xi suddenly noticed a trace of an irregularity, and he vaguely heard sounds of discussion coming from a hill that was extremely far from Spiritcave Lake.Chen Xi pondered slightly then silently snuck over towards the hill.The hill was completely barren, exposing numerous smooth and sharp rocks. At this moment, over 100 people were gathered there, but only a few tens of people were standing. They all wore black clothes and carried various weapons, wearing frosty expressions. The other people had their hands and legs tied, and they were all lay on the ground in kneeling positions.\u201cWhen will Old Freak Violet Rhino arrive?\u201d\u201cAccording to our information, it\u2019s around one hour from now.\u201d\u201cHmph! What great airs this fellow puts on! If it wasn\u2019t for the sake of\u2026 Hmph! Hmph!\u201dA familiar voice sounded out, causing Chen Xi who was concealed in the shadows to be shocked inwardly, then he raised his head to look over, and the Li Clan\u2019s Manager Wu shockingly stood at the center of the group of people.\u201cOld dog Wu! I never expected that our Pine Mist City would have such scum like you! You actually have no scruples to take our lives as tribute for the sake of getting on friendly terms with a greater demon! Truly throwing the face of your Li Clan!\u201d A weak and small youth that was bound on the ground suddenly cursed loudly in rage.\u201cBah! Scum that\u2019s willing to be the lackey of a demon beasts! Even if I\u2019m killed by a demon beast, I won\u2019t fucking let you off even in death!\u201d\u201cYour Li Clan is full of scum as expected! Fiends in human form! Worse than animals!\u201dSeeing the youth taking the lead in resisting, the other people that were bound on ground followed to start cursing out in rage, and their voice contained dense resentment and fury.\u201cCourting death!\u201d A fellow in black clothes walked forward and fiercely kicked the youth then cursed. \u201cSo what if all you trash from the Commoners District die? What\u2019s with all the nonsense?\u201dThe killing intent in Chen Xi\u2019s heart boiled when he heard this. Old dog Wu actually taking the lives of others to curry favor with a demon beast and be the lackey of a demon beast. This was utterly heartless, contemptible, and malicious to the utmost limit!\u201cWho? Come out!\u201d Manager Wu suddenly looked towards the spot Chen Xi was concealed. It was because of the fluctuation in Chen Xi\u2019s mood that had caused his aura to leak out, and it instantly drew Manager Wu\u2019s attention.\u201cOld dog Wu! I\u2019ll kill you today!\u201d When he was exposed, Chen Xi knew he couldn\u2019t hide any longer, so he walked out from the shadows right away, then coldly stared at Manager Wu with a gaze that contained dense killing intent that raged like fire.\u201cHahaha! I was wondering who it was, but it turned out to be you, jinx! Falling to your ambush a few days ago caused my Li Clan to lose three core disciples. I originally planned to get even with you later, but I never imagined that you would obediently hand yourself over. It\u2019s truly the will of the heavens!\u201dManager Wu was slightly startled when he saw Chen Xi, then he suddenly threw his head back and roared in laughter before waving his hand while ordering. \u201cGo! Break all the limbs of this fellow and cripple his cultivation! I want to make him become absolute trash!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d \u00a0A black clothed guard impatiently leapt out of the group, he had a terrifying expression on his face as he rubbed his hands together and walked towards Chen Xi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - TributePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29 - TributeEveryone who was bound on the ground were from the Pine Mist City\u2019s Commoners District. Even though they hadn\u2019t seen Chen Xi before, they\u2019d heard of Chen Xi\u2019s name and nickname. At this moment, all of them couldn\u2019t help but be stupefied when they heard about the youth that had suddenly appeared before them.\u201cChen Xi, flee quickly! You\u2019re not a match for him!\u201d Someone shouted out anxiously.\u201cRight! Flee quickly! Tell everyone about old dog Wu\u2019s evil deeds!\u201d The others recovered from their shock and all suggested at once.\u201cFlee? Can he?\u201d The black clothed guard that dashed over smiled even more terrifyingly, and he took a stride forward before raising his hand to grab towards Chen Xi\u2019s shoulder.Chen Xi didn\u2019t even spare a glance as he clenched his fist before it shot out like an arrow to smash onto the black clothed guard\u2019s chest.Bang!A low and deep sound echoed out, and the black clothed guard was directly blasted flying over 30 meters by Chen Xi\u2019s punch. The black clothed guard's terrifying smile instantly froze, his eyes sprang wide open and his face flashed red. He spat out a mouthful of dark red blood before falling limply on the ground and was completely unable to stand up again.\u201cYou deserved death!\u201d Chen Xi withdrew his fist and his expression was already extremely icy cold.The atmosphere instantly became deathly silent.No matter if it was the people who were bound on the ground, or those black clothed guards, they all looked at that tall and thin figure with disbelief.\u201cIdiot! All of you go together!\u201d Manager Wu was the first to recover from his shock, and he shouted out in explosive rage.He was extremely shocked in his heart as well. All these black clothed people by his side were core guards that the Li Clan had fostered and they all had strengths at the Congenital Realm. Moreover, they carried out sanguinary missions all through the year, and their martial skills and live combat experience had been tempered to become extremely abundant since a long time ago. Yet, unexpectedly, the black clothed guard had only just made a move when he was killed by a single punch from Chen Xi. If he didn\u2019t see it with his own two eyes, Manager Wu would almost not dare believe his eyes.Although he thought like this, Manager Wu still felt slightly ill at ease and his gaze couldn\u2019t help but once again descend onto Chen Xi.Meanwhile, all those black clothed guards had already moved out.\u201cKill!\u201d The miserable death of their comrade and the furious roar of Manager Wu completely caused these black clothed guards to be filled with rage, and they all transformed into afterimages as they fiercely pounced towards Chen Xi.Thump! Thump! Thump!Chen Xi stepped forward with steady and forceful steps that were neither fast nor slow, seeming to completely not notice the change in situation in his surroundings.\u201cWatch out!\u201d\u201cQuickly flee! Do you not want to live?!\u201dThose people that were bound on the ground shouted out anxiously. Although Chen Xi killed a black clothed guard with a single blow, he was still only one person after all. These elite guards from the Li Clan were extremely skilled in group attacks, and the lone Chen Xi would have a close to zero chance to win when jointly attacked by them.Bang!Chen Xi completely disregarded the saber that was smashing towards him, and directly struck his fist towards the pit of his opponent\u2019s stomach.\u201cKacha!\u201dThe attacking black clothed guard\u2019s was full of smiles when he saw Chen Xi being so careless and his saber struck onto Chen Xi\u2019s shoulder. What caused him to be stunned was that his full force saber strike only left a faint white mark on Chen Xi\u2019s shoulder, whereas his own abdomen was thoroughly penetrated by Chen Xi\u2019s punch and he fell on the ground and exclaimed miserably a few times before breathing his last breath.On the other hand, Chen Xi relied on this strike to break free of his situation of being surrounded. He was like a tiger that had escaped its cage, easily moving through the black clothed guards that surrounded him, and his fist was like dense raindrops that splashed out.Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!A string of heavy sounds of a fist smashing onto the body echoed out, and the 10 plus black clothed guards were like kites that had their strings cut off as they flew out with deeply sunken chests, and thick blood flowed out from their five orifices.\u201cHow could this be possible?!\u201d\u201cMy god!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026 This isn\u2019t real, right?\u201dEveryone present was shocked by the scene before them, and their pupils dilated as they gazed in disbelief at the tall figure that stood between the blood and corpses.\u201cYou\u2026 We\u2019re the black clothed guards of the Li Clan!\u201d The unsightly expressions of the other black clothed guards revealed a trace of terror. They were furious, but didn\u2019t dare arbitrarily move forward.\u201cI precisely want to kill all of you!\u201d Chen Xi said in a cold voice. The Li Clan and the Chen Clan were originally mortal enemies, as the suspicion on the Li Clan was the biggest in the matter of Chen Tianli being ambushed to death and Chen Hao having his right arm crippled. So he naturally didn\u2019t hold back in the slightest when killing them.Whoosh!Chen Xi\u2019s body drew back like a bow before throwing himself forward once again, the formidable Grand Collapsing Fist was exerted by him at full force, and it transformed into layer upon layer of fist images that killed another eight black clothed guards in the blink of an eye.\u201cThis fellow\u2019s body is utterly impenetrable by swords and sabers. He\u2019s obviously cultivated a profound body refinement technique. Flee quickly!\u201d\u201cFlee!\u201dThe remaining five black clothed guards shouted out in fright and they actually didn\u2019t bother about Manager Wu as they turned around, intending to flee.How could Chen Xi allow his enemies to flee right before his eyes? His body swayed at once and was last to move but first to arrive. Fist images flashed as his swift and fierce fist shot out fist lights that were condensed from True Essence to tear through the air towards the black clothed guards.Instantly, a hole that was the size of a bowl appeared on the backs of the remaining five black clothed guards and they fell down lifelessly.\u201cHuh?\u201d Manager Wu wasn\u2019t able to maintain his composure any longer and his face went pale. Those fist lights of Chen Xi\u2019s that tore through the sky caused him to notice a trace of danger.\u201cSo formidable!\u201d\u201cSo strong!\u201d\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s so composed. So it turned out his strength is actually so terrifying!\u201dThose people that had long since lost all hope suddenly became excited, as when they saw Chen Xi\u2019s straightforward killing methods, a strand of hope once again lit ablaze in their hearts.\u201cHmph! I never imagined that you actually cultivated in body refinement to the Congenital Realm. If I\u2019m not wrong, it seems that your fist technique is soon to advance to the advanced-stage. No wonder you dare be so arrogant. Unfortunately, I\u2019m already halfway into the Violet Palace Realm, and the strength I control is something you\u2019re utterly incapable of imagining.\u201d Manager Wu\u2019s triangular eyes slightly narrowed.Although he spoke like this, he didn\u2019t dare be careless in the slightest. He didn\u2019t care about the miserable deaths of the black clothed guards, but Chen Xi\u2019s strength instead caused him have no choice but to be cautious.It was common knowledge that the school of body refinement was the most difficult cultivation pathway. The slowness of cultivation and the difficulty of advancing wasn\u2019t inferior to climbing a towering mountain on foot. But the strength of a body refiner was extremely shocking, as a body refiner completely dominated all qi refiners of the same cultivation. This was indisputable!What Manager Wu said wasn\u2019t wrong, Chen Xi precisely relied on the strength of his body that was extremely strong and the Grand Collapsing Fist that was soon to break through to the second level to successively kill over 20 black clothed guards in a short amount of time. Otherwise, solely based on his cultivation, facing the attacks of a group of initial-stage Congenital Realm black clothed guards with his qi refinement cultivation that was at the 8th level of the Congenital Realm was only courting death.\u201cCut the crap! I\u2019ll be taking your fucking life today!\u201d Chen Xi said coldly. The battle with the black clothed guards couldn\u2019t be considered dangerous, but it instead allowed him to further confirm his strength. Under the combination of his 8th level Congenital Realm qi refinement cultivation and his initial-stage Congenital Realm body refinement cultivation, he completely didn\u2019t fear any Congenital Realm cultivators.\u201cHmph! Since you\u2019re courting death, I\u2019ll fulfill your wish!\u201d Manager Wu grunted coldly. His large hands that were like bamboo were covered in a layer of thick black mist, then he fiercely slapped his hands onto the ground.Kacha!The ground suddenly split open, and a pitch-black windy fissure swiftly spread out to the surroundings like a bolt of lightning.Not giving time to Chen Xi to recover from his shock, a loud bang echoed out, and countless amounts of sharp rubble shot out of the fissures on the ground that spread out like a spider\u2019s web, like hidden weapons that whizzed as they shot out like a storm. The target of the rubble was shockingly those people that were bound on the ground!\u201cShameless!\u201d Chen Xi finally got his head around the matter, and he shouted out explosively at once. His figure then flashed to stand before the group of people and his fists were swift like lightning as the struck towards the approaching rubble that blotted out the sky.However, the amount of rubble was in the tens of thousands and were dense like a swarm of locusts. Chen Xi went all out and was only barely able to protect the people in an area of 3 meters around him, whereas due to being bound on the ground and unable to move, the other people who were slightly further from him were instantly robbed of their lives by the sharp rubble.\u201cHahaha! These tributes are the food of Old Freak Violet Rhino! Now that so many have died, you just wait to suffer his fury! I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t keep you company!\u201d Manager Wu laughed loudly in complacency from afar, then his figure leapt up and he\u2019d vanished after a few leaps.Watching helplessly as Manager Wu fled off caused Chen Xi to have no place to vent his bellyful of rage, and his expression became even more icy cold.Bang!After smashing the last piece of rubble, Chen Xi turned to look but he noticed that more than half of the bound people were dead, and only 30 over people remained.Chen Xi took a deep breath and forcefully controlled the urge to give chase. The pressing matter of the moment was how to send all these people back to Pine Mist City from the extremely dangerous Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area.Chen Xi pondered for a moment, then called over Lu Shaocong\u2019s group of three that was concealed 5 km away and instructed the three of them to send these people back, whereas he instead chose to stay on the spot.Lu Shaocong\u2019s group of three had vaguely seen the earlier battle from the low hill, but their strengths were too weak so they didn\u2019t dare arbitrarily take action and could only inwardly pray for Chen Xi to be victorious.At this moment, when they saw the corpses and blood that covered the ground, and heard that all these people were tributes the Li Clan brought here to satisfy the belly of a greater demon, their hearts were filled with shock, fury, and indignation. Immediately, they didn\u2019t hesitate to protect the mere 30 plus people that remained and carefully left.After sending Lu Shaocong and others off with his gaze, Chen Xi sat cross-legged on the ground right away. The dense smell of blood caused his mood to be in an extremely stifling state and he urgently wanted to vent his feelings. So that Violet Rhino greater demon became his target.Boom!It wasn\u2019t even 15 minutes when the faraway Spiritcave Lake suddenly shot out sprays of water that flooded the sky. A large fellow that was 3 meters tall stepped on the sprays as he dashed over while booms echoed out.The large fellow was bald with a single eye, his 3 meter tall figure had muscles that seemed hard like a rock, and the muscles on his body all bulged largely, seeming to contain terrifying explosive force.Chen Xi abruptly stood up and a trace of icy cold killing intent appeared on the corners of his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - Collapsing a Rock Into PowderPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30 - Collapsing a Rock Into Powder\u201cHmm?\u201d In practically an instant, the single-eyed large fellow appeared on the hill and his gaze swept the surroundings. As he gazed at the Li Clan black clothed guards that had died miserably, his expression suddenly became unsightly.\u201cYou killed all these people?\u201d The single-eyed large fellow turned to gaze fiercely at Chen Xi who stood alone in the distance and his expression kept shifting irregularly.Chen Xi didn\u2019t answer him, instead he coldly asked, \u201cYou\u2019re that Violet Horned animal?\u201dThe single-eyed large fellow was stunned, then he burst into a rage and shouted out explosively. \u201cHuman kid! You dare insult me?\u201d\u201cNot only did I insult you, I also want to kill you today!\u201dAfter confirming the identity of the single-eyed large fellow, Chen Xi didn\u2019t hesitate any longer and his figure flashed out. His fist contained a terrifying strength as it fiercely struck at the Violet Rhino greater demon.\u201cA Congenital Realm kid actually dares to be conceited before me? Truly courting death!\u201d The Violet Rhino greater demon was completely enraged when he saw Chen Xi being more unreasonable than himself and he extended out his hand that was like a fan to fierce grab towards Chen Xi\u2019s fist.Since the moment Manager Wu fled, Chen Xi had a ball of rage suppressed within his heart that he had no place to vent. When he saw the Violet Rhino greater demon at this moment, he wouldn\u2019t let himself suffer any longer and decided to attack right away with full force. At this moment, when Chen Xi saw the Violet Rhino greater demon being conceited to the point he wanted to use his hand to grab onto Chen Xi\u2019s fist, Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but sneer in his heart.Bang!The fist and palm collided and emitted a terrifying loud bang. A stream of air rolled out and the air emitted buzzing sounds of vibrating, and numerous trenches instantly split open due to the ground beneath their feet being unable to endure the terrifying pressure from their attacks.This fist strike contained Chen Xi\u2019s formidable strength of his body mixed with the terrifying strength of his 8th level Congenital Realm cultivation, and were shot out through the instant force exertion of the Grand Collapsing Fist to directly blast the Violet Rhino greater demon flying 10 over meters!What caused Chen Xi to be surprised was that the Violet Rhino greater demon stood firmly the moment he dropped onto the ground and he was actually without the slightest injury.\u201cYou\u2019re strength isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s still too weak to me!\u201d The Violet Rhino greater demon\u2019s single-eye emitted a vicious and fierce expression and he had a face full of resentment as he said, \u201cNext, I\u2019ll let you experience what is a true Congenital Realm greater demon!\u201dAs he spoke, billowing demonic qi abruptly surged out from the Violet Rhino greater demon\u2019s body, and his entire body instantly transformed into an enormous rhino that was 30 meters tall. His brownish violet colored thick skin was suffused with demonic qi and his entire enormous body was like a small mountain. Chen Xi was like an ant before him, as Chen Xi\u2019s height wasn\u2019t even up to his knees. Most shocking of all was that atop its thick and strong neck was an astonishing two enormous heads.Roar!The Violet Rhino greater demon that had resumed his beast form roared towards the sky with a thunderous voice that caused booms to echo out in an area of tens of kilometers around him. The various demon beasts that cultivated underwater in Spiritcave Lake all raised their heads in fear and started to shiver.There was no fear in Chen Xi\u2019s heart, and instead battle intent that was boiling like lava surged through his entire body.\u201cKid! If you only know how to swing those two laughable fists, then you can wait to become my side dish for wine today!\u201dAs he laughed wildly without restraint, the Violet Rhino greater demon abruptly lifted his hooves that were enormous like a center column of a house to fiercely descend down from above and directly trample towards Chen Xi.Bang!An ear piercing explosion sounded out from a stream of air shattering, seeming as if this stomp had stomped a hole through the sky. It hadn\u2019t even touched Chen Xi, when Chen Xi had already understood its might.Bang!Chen Xi leapt up, his fist that spewed an eye piercing shine of True Essence was like a whistling shooting star as it smashed onto the enormous hoof of the Violet Rhino greater demon with a loud bang. Yet, it only left a sunken fist print and caused very little injury.Chen Xi instantly retreated.Bang! Bang!The fierce battle on the ground caused the ground to split into countless cracks, and an enormous chasm appeared at the heart of the cracks.\u201cIt\u2019s no use. My Violet Rhino race possesses peerless defense by nature, and I\u2019ve experienced thousands of years of tempering. My body has attained an extremely high level since long ago. If you were a Violet Palace Realm sword cultivator, I might still fear you. But unfortunately, you aren\u2019t. At most you\u2019re only a little kid who knows little fist technique. Hahaha\u2026\u201d The Violet Rhino greater demon couldn\u2019t refrain from roaring with laughter when he saw Chen Xi dodging in a sorry state, and his hooves stomped on the ground as he once again trampled towards Chen Xi\u2019s small body that was like an ant to him.Chen Xi flashed backwards once again, and he madly pondered in his mind as he dashed violently.\u201cAfraid? Want to run? Hmph! You can\u2019t escape!\u201d The Violet Rhino greater demon roared as he followed close behind Chen Xi. He moved swiftly with his thick and strong enormous hooves, completely disregarding everything in his path as he forced his way forward.Kacha! Kacha!Numerous large trees that required many people to encircle, seemed like straw that was extremely weak under the trampling of the Violet Rhino greater demon\u2019s enormous hooves and they collapsed onto the ground with a bang.Swoosh!Chen Xi reached the peak of a large tree with a leap, then he turned around to face the Violet Rhino greater demon that was dashing over in attack.\u201cWaiting for death?\u201d The Violet Rhino greater demon roared with complacent laughter, then fiercely stomped towards the large tree.Right at this moment, the top of Chen Xi\u2019s leg suddenly hit the tree trunk and using the rebound force from the tree trunk, his body was like an arrow that left the bow as he swished swiftly up high into the sky, then his waist twisted and he moved into a windy arc to firmly descend onto the Violet Rhino greater demons back.\u201cGet the fuck down!\u201d The Violet Rhino greater demon burst into rage when Chen Xi leapt onto his back, and his enormous body started to sway violently.Chen Xi had seized this opportunity with great difficulty, how could he allow himself to drop off? His legs instantly exerted strength and his body was like an ancient tree that was rooted deep within the ground, no matter how the Violet Rhino swayed, he didn\u2019t move in the slightest.His two fists instead were like raindrops as they descended onto the head of the Violet Rhino greater demon with an extremely high frequency.Bang! Bang! Bang!The strength of Chen Xi\u2019s body was tempered by the baleful qi of five different stars, and couple with his condensed and dense True Essence, every fist strike of Chen Xi\u2019s was like a 150,000 kg iron hammer smashing down. Instantly, a mark that sunk extremely deeply was smashed out on the Violet Rhino greater demons thick skinned and strong head, but unfortunately, it was still unable to break open his skin.\u201cI\u2019ll eat you!\u201d Suddenly, wind that smelt of dense blood came straight at Chen Xi\u2019s face, the Violet Rhino greater demons other enormous head had turned around, and he opened up his bloody mouth that had crisscrossing fangs that were sharp like swords to fiercely bite towards Chen Xi.Chen Xi had expected most of this since long ago, and he suddenly dashed out wildly, stepping onto the Violet Rhino greater demons neck right until the end, and like a small nimble monkey, his body leapt up to barely dodge the Violet Rhino greater demons bloody mouth. After this, an eye piercing fist light appeared on his right hand that had been accumulating force since long ago, and his fist was swift like a bolt of lightning as he fiercely smashed it towards the Violet Rhino greater demons eyeball.Bang!The skin and flesh on the Violet Rhino greater demons entire body was thick and rough, and his defensive ability was shocking, but that eyeball of his that was the size of a millstone was still extremely frail. Under Chen Xi\u2019s fist that had been accumulating force for a long time, a large hole was instantly blasted out on his eyeball, and a ball of disgusting green fluid sprayed out.Roar!The Violet Rhino greater demon ceaselessly howled at the sky, and his enormous head swung about madly.And Chen Xi seized this opportunity to swoop down like a hawk from mid-air, and firmly descend on the spot he was at earlier, then he once again fiercely smashed his fist towards the sunken spot at the middle of the Violet Rhino\u2019s head.The Violet Rhino greater demon had already been completely enraged, and if he didn\u2019t make the best use of his time to break open the defense on the Violet Rhino\u2019s head, then an unforeseen event might again if he were to be slow.A strong sense of urgency caused Chen Xi\u2019s mind to highly concentrate, he only had a single thought in his heart, and that was to break open the skin and flesh before him, break open\u2026 He\u2019d forgotten everything in his surroundings, forgotten the Grand Collapsing Fist that he\u2019d already become skilled in, and he sunk into a type of obsessed yet chaotic state.Bang! Bang! Bang!Chen Xi\u2019s fist sounded oppressive like thunder, within the chaotic sound of the fist strikes was a trace of a strange rhythm, and his fist strikes became rhythmic. Every time his fist descended, the force of his fist would slowly increase. Within Chen Xi\u2019s mind, the scenes of him cultivating the Grand Collapsing Fist during the past month appeared clearly, and traces of enlightenment silently accumulated\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll kill you! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d The Violet Rhino greater demon was completely enraged from having one of his eyes injured and Chen Xi sticking onto him like sticky candy. He seemed to be in a frenzied state as his body that was enormous like a mountain lifted off the ground, then fiercely smashed himself towards the ground with his back facing downwards. Judging by his actions, he seemed to want to smash Chen Xi to death on the ground.Om!Right at the instant the Violet Rhino greater demon lifted himself off the ground, Chen Xi awoke from that strange state, and a trace of a radiant splendor suddenly flashed within his eyes. He lifted his right hand and the surrounding air was instantly shaken to the point circles of ripples could be seen with the eye, then it emitted a buzzing sharp whistle as he fiercely smashed his fist down!Crack! Crack!Countless cracks suddenly appeared on the enormous head of the Violet Rhino greater demon, then a cracking sound echoed out, and the enormous head transformed into countless pieces of flesh and bone bits that rustled as they fell onto the ground, seeming to be like it was raining bits of blood, flesh, and bones.And at this moment, the enormous body of the Violet Rhino greater demon crashed onto the ground with a bang.\u201cAH!\u201d The Violet Rhino greater demon lost a head and an eye of his other head was injured, and he lay on the ground as he emitted low and miserable howls of pain.The vitality of demon beasts were extremely strong, and they were able to recover to their previous state even if their limbs were severed off, but their heads and hearts were their true weak points. And at this moment, having one of his heads blasted into pieces caused the Violet Rhino greater demon to be heavily injured.\u201cTell me, why did the Li Clan want to offer tributes to you? I can let you die a swift death.\u201d Chen Xi stood in the distance as he said coldly.\u201cDon\u2019t I still have to die even if I tell you? Be forthright and kill me!\u201d The Violet Rhino greater demon said resentfully. The large amounts of blood that surged out of where his head was severed caused his vitality to become weaker and weaker.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t tell me.\u201d Chen Xi walked forward and mercilessly smashed out with his fist, and the remaining head of the Violet Rhino greater demon instantly transformed into a pool of blood and flesh mud.A Congenital realm greater demon that had cultivated bitterly for thousands of years had died just like this.Chen Xi silently felt the changes in the Grand Collapsing Fist\u2019s might and he couldn\u2019t help but slightly sigh with emotion in his heart. \u201cSenior Ji Yu wasn\u2019t mistaken. Sure enough, martial skills are only able to be tempered to achieve an even stronger might in life and death battles. I wonder what sort of might the third level of the Grand Collapsing Fist would have\u2026?\u201dKilling the two-headed Violet Rhino greater demon caused the killing intent and rage within Chen Xi\u2019s heart to be fully vented, and the most gratifying thing was that he\u2019d attained the second level of his fist technique. Combined with his own cultivation, he\u2019d already become fearless of anyone with a similar cultivation as him!\u201cThis stupid cow had cultivated for thousands of years. I wonder what valuable things he has\u2026?\u201dSwoosh!Chen Xi instantly arrived beside the enormous corpse of the Violet Rhino greater demon, then his hands grabbed out to swiftly tear the thick skin of the Violet Rhino starting along the spot the head was severed.After a short while, an inconspicuous storage ring fell onto the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - Li HuaiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31 - Li HuaiChen Xi picked up the inconspicuous storage ring and briefly searched through it, and he couldn\u2019t help but inwardly exclaim in surprise.This storage ring only had a space of an area of 33m and was obviously not of high grade. However, it contained a pile of 3,000 spirit crystals that contained dense spirit energy, and it was exchangeable for an entire 300,000 spirit stones!\u201cThis stupid cow actually stored so many spirit crystals. Perhaps it\u2019s for the sake of breaking through to the Violet Palace Realm in the future? Unfortunately, it\u2019s instead benefitted me.\u201d Chen Xi was extremely excited in his heart. Perhaps 3,000 spirit crystals were nothing to some of the great clans and institution in Pine Mist City, but to Chen Xi who was poverty stricken since young, this sum of spirit crystals was an absolutely astronomical figure. With these spirit crystal in his possession, he was completely capable of buying numerous magic treasures, spirit pills, martial skills, and even pay for all his expenses. He didn\u2019t need to laboriously rush about to bring home the bacon.However, Chen Xi still didn\u2019t intend to leave his work as a spirit chef apprentice, because he\u2019d promised the owner of Clear Stream Restaurant, Du Qingxi, long ago that within these three years, so long as he didn\u2019t leave Pine Mist City, he would absolutely not quit his job.A man is nothing without his word!To cultivators, destroying one\u2019s own promise for the sake of the small gain before one\u2019s eyes was no different from destroying one\u2019s Dao Heart.Chen Xi still remembered that when he was four, the Su Clan who had a daughter betrothed to him since before he was born had sent more than 10 Golden Hall Realm experts to stand atop the sky as they tore his marriage contract to shreds before the eyes of everyone within Pine Mist City, then flew off after going back on their promise. Whereas his grandfather suffered endless mocking and ridicule. That humiliation and shame that was impossible to forget caused his young heart to suffer great harm and he was unable to forget it for his entire life.And it was because of this that he cared and valued promises much more than others.\u201cEh! What\u2019s this?\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s thoughtlessly glanced at a corner of the storage ring, and he suddenly noticed a strange thing that was palm-sized. When he picked it up to take a look, he noticed that this was a black colored jade token that was the shape of a key, and three ancient words were written atop it \u2014 Nether Enlightenment Token.Chen Xi could only give up after trying various methods and didn\u2019t noticed any peculiarity about this Nether Enlightenment Token, then he hid the storage ring in his pocket before looking at the color of the sky for time. He didn\u2019t dare stay here any longer, and he turned and left.After 15 minutes.Chen Xi had finally walked out of the Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area and returned to the dense forest.Ji Yu who was dozing on the rattan chair slowly opened his eyes, his gaze swept Chen Xi and seemed to have already seen through all the secrets on Chen Xi, and he lightly laughed. \u201cYour gains aren\u2019t bad.\u201dChen Xi thought about the various encounters of tonight, and he deeply agreed. \u201cOnly through a true life and death battle did I realize that I actually had so many inadequacies. If it wasn\u2019t for my good luck of encountering a stupid Violet Rhino greater demon, I\u2019m afraid I would have been in danger tonight.\u201dJi Yu lightly smiled then picked up the azure skinned bottle gourd and drank too mouthfuls of the strong wine before smacking his lips. \u201cThis is the benefit of actual combat. It\u2019s able to allow you to clearly recognize your own inadequacies. Let\u2019s go. The sky is about to get light and we have to return.\u201dAs he spoke, Ji Yu casually waved his hand, and at the next moment, the two of them vanished on the spot, only leaving a strand of faint wine fragrance in the air.\u2026Li Clan Main Hall.Numerous elders that stayed in closed doors had gathered together here today.\u201cManager Wu, 30 of our Li Clan\u2019s elite guards with cultivations at the initial-stage of the Congenital Realm all died at the hand of trash that only knows how to craft talismans? Truly absurd!\u201dThe one who spoke was a black bearded old man. Although he had an aged face, his skin was like jade and had a pair of clear eyes. His body emitted a dignified aura that was frosty and stern. He was Grand Elder, Li Fengtu, who had the most profound cultivation in the Li Clan.Manager Wu knelt down with a \u2018thump,\u2019 and his emaciated face sweated profusely as he ceaselessly repeated with a trembling voice. \u201cThis old servant is useless, this old servant is useless\u2026\u201d\u201cOne month ago, because the General\u2019s Estate\u2019s Luo Chong and the Pine Mist Institute\u2019s Meng Kong butted in, Li Han and his brothers died tragically in the Commoners District, and Chen Tianli\u2019s young grandson, Chen Hao, was about to leave Pine Mist City. I can forgive all of this.\u201d\u201cBut, I\u2019ll absolutely not let today\u2019s matter go. For the sake of obtaining the Nether Enlightenment Token in the possession of Old Freak Violet Rhino, my Li Clan has spent too much! I can\u2019t bear such a failure, and the entire Li Clan can\u2019t bear it!\u201dGrand Elder Li Fengtu\u2019s voice was low, frosty, and stern; it contained boundless rage within. The atmosphere in the main hall became even more silent and oppressive, and no one dared make a single sound.\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault, I\u2019ve always neglected monitoring Chen Xi\u2026\u201d Li Yizhen felt as if sitting on a bed of nails, his forehead dripped with sweat and his expression was guilty and uneasy. He was without even a shred of a patriarch\u2019s dignified manner.\u201cHmph.\u201d The Grand Elder snorted coldly, and his expression eased up quite a bit. \u201cThe blame for this matter isn\u2019t on you. For the sake of our current plans, we must seize the Nether Enlightenment Token as soon as possible, before the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trails that\u2019s three months from now. Otherwise, once this matter is known by the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan\u2026\u201dEven though it was just a mere five words, but it was like a heavy hammer that fiercely smashed onto Li Yizhen\u2019s heart, and his expression abruptly went unsightly, then he took a deep breath and gritted his teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Grand Elder, I\u2019ll reclaim the Nether Enlightenment Token even if I have to use all the strength of the Li Clan!\u201dCrack!Right at this moment, the tightly closed door of the main hall was opened. All the elders present were enraged in their hearts. Who was so audacious as to dare enter arbitrarily?Bang!An enormous black silhouette crashed onto the ground, it was shockingly the corpse of the Violet Rhino that Chen Xi had killed.\u201cOld Freak Violet Rhino has been killed, that Nether Enlightenment Token ought to have fallen into Chen Xi\u2019s possession.\u201dA tall figure accompanied by an icy cold voice that was indifferent, slowly walked in. He had sword shaped eyebrows and starry eyes, with hair that touched the shoulder, and he emitted a shocking killing intent as he walked with even steps.The heart of Manager Wu that knelt on the floor couldn\u2019t help but go cold, and was even more afraid of raising his head as he knelt there.This person was precisely the person reputed to be the Li Clan\u2019s genius figure that was rarely seen in a thousand years \u2014 Li Huai!He started cultivating at the age of three, then advanced to the Congenital Realm at the age of nine, and attained the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm at the age of 13. After that, he went into closed door cultivation in the Ancestral House for four years. At this moment, since he\u2019d emerged from his closed door cultivation, he\u2019d surely had already established his Dao Foundation in one go to step into the Violet Palace Realm!The rage in the hearts of the people present instantly vanished when they saw the person was Li Huai, and the elders all revealed slight smiles. In their hearts, Li Huai who was like a favored genius of the gods had already possessed the qualification to participate in the clan\u2019s discussions in the main hall.\u201cFather.\u201d Li Huai lightly nodded to Li Yizhen, then he sat down at the side, seeming completely indifferent.A burst of gratification and pride arose within Li Yizhen\u2019s heart. With such a son, the Li Clan\u2019s glorious future was not far off from being realized!\u201cOld Freak Violet Rhino was killed by that Chen Clan trash as well? Looks like this kid has grown!\u201d Li Fengtu glanced at the corpse on the ground and his voice revealed a trace of astonishment.Manager Wu who knelt on the ground said hurriedly, \u201cGrand Elder really has eyes filled with wisdom. According to this old servant\u2019s observation, not only has the qi refinement cultivation of that kid attained an extremely high level, but he\u2019s also cultivated a profound body refinement technique that has already advanced to the Congenital Realm. If he isn\u2019t killed as soon as possible, this kid will surely become a great calamity to our Li Clan.\u201dAs soon as this was spoken, everyone present revealed a trace of astonishment. Among cultivators of the same cultivation, the school of body refinement crushed all the cultivators of the school of qi refinement, whereas within Pine Mist City, although it was rare to see body refiners advancing to the Congenital Realm, their might was something no one dared look down upon.\u201cI\u2019ll go kill him right now!\u201d Li Huai who sat there without moving suddenly spoke out, and heavy killing intent was contained between his handsome brows, seeming to be extremely repulsed and disgusted by Chen Xi\u2019s growth.Li Huai\u2019s reaction seemed to have been within the expectations of everyone since a long time ago, and Li Yizhen hurriedly said when he heard this, \u201cHuai, calm down. Chen Xi\u2019s marriage contract with the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan has already been destroyed. No matter how he improves, it would still be absolutely impossible for him to marry Miss Su Jiao.\u201d\u201cFather, the Su Clan had once promised us that the Su Clan\u2019s Patriarch would agree to marry Su Jiao to me on the condition that Chen Xi\u2019s cultivation is crippled and we pay the price of humiliating Chen Xi to death. Now that this kid grown successfully, if we still don\u2019t take any action, I\u2019m afraid it will be too late.\u201d Li Huai who had an icy cold and indifferent disposition seemed to have become a normal person when he spoke about this marriage that hadn\u2019t been concluded.\u201cHuai is right, now that we can already be sure that the Nether Enlightenment Token has fallen into Chen Xi\u2019s possession, since it\u2019s like this, we should take action as soon as possible.\u201dGrand Elder Li Fengtu pondered slightly then slowly said, \u201cManager Wu, where does this kid live now?\u201d\u201cClear Stream Restaurant.\u201dManager Wu hurriedly replied, \u201cSince the assassination failed last month, that kid seemed to have noticed it was not safe and has stayed in the Clear Stream Restaurant ever since.\u201d\u201cClear Stream Restaurant? Hmph! It\u2019s only a lousy restaurant that has good relations with the General\u2019s Estate. Yizhen, arranged for some people to capture that kid and bring him back here tonight. Kill anyone that dares obstruct you!\u201dLi Fengtu coldly snorted, then slowly said, \u201cI want to let everyone within Pine Mist City know that death is the only end for someone who offends my Li Clan.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry Grand Elder, I guarantee to complete this mission!\u201d Li Yizhen respectfully accepted the orders.\u201cDu Qingxi isn\u2019t so easily bullied.\u201d Right at this moment, a voice that was pleasing to the ear the chime of a bell which was accompanied by a delicate fragrance floated in from outside the main hall, seeming to give one an image of a delicate and graceful woman, and this caused the expression of everyone within the entire main hall to go grim.Although the expression of the Grand Elder, Li Fengtu, didn\u2019t change, but shock had arisen within his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - Su JiaoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32 - Su JiaoThe answer was quickly known.Under the gazes of everyone present, a young girl clad in an azure dress had a calm expression as she walked in with even steps.She was comely with lovely hair that was fluffy like clouds, her sweet and charming oval shaped face was slightly raised, and her indifferent expression revealed a trace of arrogance that was unable to be concealed.Li Huai was the first to recover from his shock when he saw this young girl clad in an azure dress, and abruptly stood up as he said in pleasant surprise, \u201cMiss Su!\u201dAt this moment, the other people present all recognized the identity of this young girl clad in an azure dress. Some of them were excited, some surprised, and some instead lightly frowned.\u201cDragon Lake City\u2019s Su Jiao pays her respect to all the uncles present here.\u201d The young girl clad in an azure dress slightly bowed as she spoke in a pleasant voice.The Li Clan elders recovered from their shock and all held smiles on their faces as they greeted her. After Su Jiao took her seat, the Grand Elder, Li Fengtu, suddenly asked, \u201cLittle Jiao, who\u2019s this Du Qingxi you mentioned earlier?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s naturally the owner of Clear Stream Restaurant.\u201d Su Jiao lightly smiled then sighed, \u201cShe\u2019s a favored genius of the gods that\u2019s famous within Dragon Lake City and the precious daughter of the Du Clan\u2019s Patriarch. Even I don\u2019t dare offend her lightly.\u201dEveryone present was shocked.Dragon Lake City was the heart of the southern territory that covered an area of 500,000 km, and was akin to a capital city. Practically all the great clans and great sects that could be considered to possess terrifying strength within the entire southern territory were all situated there.Among the numerous great powers, the eight great sects, the three great institutions, and the six great clans stood out exceptionally. The strengths of these great powers, and the abundance of their hidden resources and reserves were something that ordinary people were completely unable to imagine.The Su Clan that Su Jiao was born in, and the Du Clan that Du Qingxi was born in, were both one of the six great clans in Dragon Lake City. Although the Li Clan domineered in Pine Mist City, when faced with this little girl, Su Jiao, that came from one of the six great clans of Dragon Lake City, they still had to maintain sufficient respect. This was the disparity of strength and hidden resources and reserves between their clans!Li Fengtu felt a burst of extreme fear when he thought of the terrifying background of Du Qingxi.\u201cUncles, all of you don\u2019t have to worry, and you don\u2019t have to make a move against a piece of trash from a shattered family anymore. According to my knowledge, Du Qingxi seems to want to foster him into a spirit chef and take him into the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials. At that time, I\u2019ll go in and seize the Nether Enlightenment Token from him.\u201dSu Jiao\u2019s expression was calm and indifferent, as if she was speaking of an insignificant matter, then she lightly smiled and said, \u201cI want to see what ability this fellow who was betrothed to me since childhood actually has.\u201d\u201cMiss Su, since you\u2019ve come to Pine Mist City, then as the host, I\u2019ll accompany you to there.\u201d Li Huai said in a clear voice, and his eyes emitted undisguised and dense passion.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be troubling you.\u201d Su Jiao smiled as she nodded with an expression that was indifferent as before, and what she actually thought in her heart was unable to be perceived.\u2026Three months rushed by.Chen Xi sat on the floor and slowly opened a book.The book recorded his cultivation experience and the changes in his state of mind over the past three months. He\u2019d started writing down his gains in cultivation every day since that day he killed the two-headed Violet Rhino greater demon.The reason he did so was something that Chen Xi couldn\u2019t explain. It seemed to be because leaving his job of talisman crafting that he\u2019d devoted himself to for four years had caused him to feel difficulty to adapt to it, so he kept wanting to pick up his talisman brush and arbitrarily draw and write for some time.Actually, Chen Xi knew himself, that he still loved crafting talismans extremely. He loved the patterns of the talisman markings that he drew himself; and he loved the path of the talisman markings that were fine and profound, and were filled with beauty.Now, all this instead appeared in the form of words in the book, and it recorded every little bit of the things on his mind that he wasn\u2019t willing to pour out to another.\u2026As he flipped through the pages, he seemed to be able to see his emotion at that time, and the corners of Chen Xi\u2019s mouth couldn\u2019t help but curl into a slight smile.Old man Ma pushed upon the door and entered, and said in surprise, \u201cEh, you\u2019re actually able to smile, kid?\u201dIn his impression, Chen Xi was indeed like his nickname, Deadpan Chen, as his expression always remained without change. At this moment, when he saw the smile flash in the corners of Chen Xi\u2019s mouth, he couldn\u2019t help but be extremely surprised.Chen Xi closed the book and asked, \u201cI have to start training in the 3 leaf spirit chef culinary arts?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t advanced to the Violet Palace Realm. You won\u2019t improve much if you learn it now.\u201d Old man ma shook his head, then said, \u201cI came here this time to let you know that Boss Du had something to discuss with you later.\u201dAs he spoke, old man Ma noticed the jade slip by Chen Xi\u2019s side with a glance, then picked it up to look, and he couldn\u2019t help but be astonished. \u201cChaotic Windsplit Sword Technique?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Chen Xi nodded.There were 3,000 spirit crystals stored within the storage ring he obtain from killing the Violet Rhino greater demon. Two months ago, he\u2019d taken out 500 spirit crystals and entrusted it to Pei Pei to buy this Chaotic Windsplit Sword Technique in the market.The Chaotic Windsplit Sword Technique was considered to be a treasure amongst the intermediate-grade martial skill. The sword moves were famous for being swift and fierce like an agile venomous serpent and fluttering like the wind. After being personally improved by the spirit of the Manor, Ji Yu, the mere six sword moves had been completely changed, and its grade had become even better, causing Chen Xi to be extremely fond of it.\u201cNot bad, cultivating some sword techniques can be used to protect yourself.\u201dOld man Ma coughed dryly. \u201cBut Chen, I think your mind ought to be placed on the Culinary Dao. A youth who possess natural talent in the Culinary Dao like you is completely capable of attaining the highest level of a spirit chef, and shocking the entire Darchu Dynasty with his name. At that time, even King Chu would invite you to be his personal spirit chef.\u201dOld man Ma drew an attractive pie that was sufficient to excite any spirit chef, but Chen Xi was instead indifferent to it, because he had too many things he wanted to do and it was completely impossible for him to be a spirit chef forever.\u201cAlas, you properly think it over by yourself, I won\u2019t force you. But if you have the chance, go participate in the spirit chef ranking competition that\u2019s held in the Darchu Dynasty once every 10 years. Take it as fulfilling a wish of mine, how about it?\u201dOld man Ma patted Chen Xi on the shoulder as his face revealed a rare trace of nervousness and anticipation.This caused Chen Xi to recall his own grandfather. Even before his death, the old man yearned to be able to rebuild the Chen Clan, but unfortunately, he was killed before he could realize his wish\u2026Chen Xi\u2019s felt sad in his heart when he thought of this, and he said with a staunch expression, \u201cI promise you!\u201dOld man Ma was stunned, and after a while, he silently turned around and left. Only when he walked out of the room did he roar out in laughter, and his low and hoarse voice revealed boundless gratification and happiness.Chen Xi shook his head and tried hard to disperse the unrealistic thoughts in his mind, then he picked up the talisman brush and started writing something on a piece of blank paper.Gulp gulp~Ji Yu suddenly appeared within the Quiet Room, and he picked up the bottle gourd before sipping a few mouthfuls of wine, then he asked, \u201cFinished writing?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d said Chen Xi, and he passed over the paper that was filled with lines of rough writing.The words on the paper were divided into 4 categories.From the day he started cultivating in his movement technique and sword technique, Ji Yu had requested that he take a day\u2019s worth of time out for self-reflection by comprehending the changes in his strength and summarizing his combat experience.According to Ji Yu: It\u2019s insufficient to talk about advancement without bitter cultivation; and without self-reflection, how could he achieve great things?Chen Xi was extremely fond of this practice, as only by being adept in summarizing combat experience and conducting self-reflection could he be able to rectify his flaws and tread more steadily and swiftly on the path of cultivation. Moreover, these papers that he\u2019d written his self-reflection on were kept by him like treasures and were compiled into a book that was named the .Ji Yu ceased reading and made no comment, then he picked up the brush and added on a line of words on the upper side of the paper. \u201cChen Xi took the paper in his hands and read it, and he couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.According to his knowledge, the soul could be considered as the most mysterious existence in a person\u2019s body. The energy of the soul was profound and difficult to comprehend, and it could be roughly divided into 5 stages, namely the Perception, Perception Force, Spiritual Perception, Divine Perception, and Divine Sense stages.However, the differentiation of soul energy wasn\u2019t strict. Some people were born with strong souls and were able to condense Perception Force when they stepped into the Congenital Realm, whereas the energy of the souls of some people had only formed into Perception when they stepped into the Violet Palace Realm.At the heart of the matter, this disparity was mostly because of the lack of a soul visualization technique.Without a visualization technique, one was unable to cultivate the soul and could only allow the soul to advance as their own cultivation advanced. It was precisely because of this that within the cultivation world, there was a centralized understanding that said Congenital Realm cultivators possessed Perception, Violet Palace Realm cultivators possessed Perception Force, Golden Hall Realm cultivators possessed Spiritual Perception, Golden Core Realm cultivators possessed Divine Perception, and cultivators at the Rebirth Realm or above possessed Divine Sense.\u201cThe wonders of the soul is far from being as simple as you think. You been visualizing the True Body Brand that my Master left behind and perhaps you\u2019ve already noticed, the strength of the soul is not only able to ceaselessly strengthen your comprehension ability, but it\u2019s similarly able to be reflected in your cultivation and martial skills.\u201dJi Yu lazily lay on the rattan chair as he explained in a light voice. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for your strong soul, it would be absolutely impossible for you to cultivate the Grand Collapsing Fist to the unity-stage. Similarly, besides diligent and bitter cultivating, your strong soul played an immeasurable role in your movement technique and sword technique\u2019s swift improvement.\u201dActually, Chen Xi had already vaguely become aware of the greatness of the soul\u2019s strength from talisman crafting and from his culinary arts. At this moment, when he heard Ji Yu\u2019s explanation, he instantly felt enlightened.\u201cLooks like I have to pay even more attention to the cultivation of the soul in the future\u2026\u201d Chen Xi muttered, then raised his head, but noticed that Ji Yu\u2019s figure had vanished, and he was still stunned by this when he heard sounds of the door-knocking coming from outside the room.\u201cChen Xi, the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials is beginning three days from now. Come out, I have something to discuss with you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - Disciple of Dragon Lake CityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33 - Disciple of Dragon Lake CityIt was Du Qingxi who\u2019d come. She seemed gentle and graceful in the black dress she wore that revealed the outline and curves of her body. She stood there beautifully outside the door with black hair that was worn in a bun, and wore no makeup, seeming to carry a type of icy cold and pure sense of beauty.\u201cSouthern Barbaric Nether Domain trials?\u201d Chen Xi was extremely bewildered as he gazed at Du Qingxi who was outside the door. He\u2019d grown up in Pine Mist City and he naturally knew everything about the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials.Every three years, a bizarre space with an extremely unfavorable environment would appear within the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range.Baleful qi billowed within the space that was devoid of any plants; a type of ash-grey gale blew within it all year long, and whether it was night and day couldn\u2019t be discerned within the space. Most importantly, the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain\u2019s spirit energy of heaven and earth had dried up, it was like an abandoned land that was devoid of life. This space was simply an existence that was like hell to cultivators who breathed the spirit energy of the heaven and earth!However, after a thousand years of research and searching, people had a new understanding of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.This space did indeed have no living creature, yet there existed a type of ferocious and bloodthirsty baleful beast with a strength that had roughly attained the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm. Moreover, there was a type of treasure called a baleful pearl that was concealed within the body of a baleful beast. Even though its usage was unknown, its value was extremely shocking.There was once a cultivator who took a baleful pearl and headed to the capital of Darchu Dynasty, Silken City, that was 5 million km away, and a baleful pearl actually sold for a whopping price of 100 spirit crystals!This incident instantly caused a stir in Pine Mist City when the news spread back. So when the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain appeared once again, practically all the cultivators in Pine Mist City swarmed over. The weird thing was that only Postnatal Realm and Congenital Realm cultivators could safely enter, and other cultivators would be obstructed by a shapeless force the moment they entered the borders of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.It was precisely because of this that the various institutions and clans within Pine Mist City jointly launched the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials activity with the General\u2019s Estate. They encouraged the younger generation of Pine Mist City who possessed a cultivation at the Congenital Realm to participate in the trials.On one hand they can obtain baleful pearls, and on the other hand the cultivators could temper their survival ability and live combat skills in the unfavorable environment of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.Most importantly, numerous clans and institution used the number of baleful pearls obtained as a standard to test their disciples. Not only would those who obtained a high amount of baleful pearls be able to become a core disciple and enjoy resources that ordinary disciples were unable to hope for, they would also be able to obtain a considerable amount of wealth to help with their expenses.Moreover, the General\u2019s Estate would send out an invitation to the top three people who obtained the most baleful pearls during the trial and invite them to enter the southern territory\u2019s Dragon Lake City\u2019s Darchu Soulguard\u2019s branch!The Darchu Soulguard was an organization under the command of the Darchu Dynasty. In terms of how terrifying its strength was, there were rarely any organizations that could compare to it within the entire territory of the Darchu Dynasty. Of course, an invitation was only an invitation, and if one wanted to join the Darchu Soulguard branch in Dragon Lake City, one would still have to pass numerous tests that were extremely harsh. The difficulty of the test was not much different from the test to enter an extremely large sect.\u201cBaleful qi billows within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain and its spirit energy is exhausted. Moreover there are numerous baleful beasts there, so staying within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain would be accompanied by continuous combat. Besides bringing along large amounts of spirit stones and medicinal pills, there\u2019s no other way for cultivators to survive within.\u201dDu Qingxi\u2019s words were succinct and chilly, like her disposition that was icy cold like snow, and it carried with it a trace of being beyond question as she slowly said, \u201cI came looking for you for the sake of entering the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain to cook for me. I\u2019ve already prepared the cooking utensils and ingredients for you. Now I\u2019ll take you to see two people.\u201d\u201cWait! When did I agree to go to the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain?\u201d Chen Xi frowned as he asked. He extremely disliked the feeling of being ordered around.Du Qingxi said as a matter of course, \u201cYou\u2019re a spirit chef apprentice employed by Clear Stream Restaurant, this is one of your duties.\u201d\u201cBut, why me?\u201d Chen Xi continued to question.\u201cYou\u2019re the disciple of old man Ma, and your cultivation is already sufficient to enter the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. Who else can satisfy this condition besides you?\u201dDu Qingxi seemed to be slightly displeased from being questioned and her beautiful brows frowned. \u201cStop talking nonsense. I won\u2019t treat you unfairly after we return from the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.\u201dAs she spoke, she turned around and walked off, seeming to be disinclined to explain another word to Chen Xi.\u201cForget it, I\u2019ll just make the trip. I\u2019ve wanted to experience how the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain is like since a long time ago as well.\u201d Chen Xi thought for a moment and followed her.Du Qingxi was correct, before he left Pine Mist City, he was still a member of Clear Stream Restaurant. Since he\u2019d taken a wage from her, he naturally ought to undertake the corresponding duties.Most importantly, practically every day during these past few months, he\u2019d trained his culinary arts behind closed doors within the Quiet Room, and the value of the ingredients he\u2019d wasted was sufficient to be described as an astronomical figure. Whereas Du Qingxi had never once asked for repayment from him, and this caused Chen Xi to feel slightly embarrassed. This was probably how it felt to be helpless against someone who you\u2019d accepted and received something from.\u2026The rear courtyard of Clear Stream Restaurant had always been the place Du Qingxi cultivated behind closed doors, and its environment was quiet and refined. Ordinarily, besides some close servants, there was rarely anyone who was able to step foot here.When Du Qingxi brought Chen Xi into the courtyard, there were precisely two young men waiting there.\u201cHe\u2019s Duanmu Ze from the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Duanmu Clan.\u201d Du Qingxi pointed at the white clothed man as she introduced him briefly and to the point.Chen Xi raised his eyes to gaze over and he couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.Duanmu Ze was absolutely a man that was handsome, noble, elegant, and had a tall figure. He wore clothes that were whiter than snow and had a graceful bearing. His thin lips lightly puckered and his serious face carried a trace of a smile that was sufficient to cause war among millions of young women.However, Chen Xi didn\u2019t care about this, as what he cared about was the clan behind Duanmu Ze.Even though Du Qingxi introduced him in an extremely casual manner, how could Chen Xi not have heard of the names of the eight great sects, three great institutions, and six great clans that\u2019s discussed animatedly everywhere in the city?All these powers had deep hidden resources and reserves, and the level of their ancientness could be traced back to over 10,000 years ago. They were far from something a newly developing clan in Pine Mist City like the Li Clan could compare to.The Duanmu Clan was one of the six great clans, so Chen Xi naturally felt slightly surprised when facing a Duanmu Clan disciple like Duanmu Ze.\u201cQingxi, doesn\u2019t this person you found seems to be slightly unreliable?\u201d Duanmu Ze raised his eyes and glanced at Chen Xi, and his brows couldn\u2019t help but slightly frown as he spoke with a flat tone that carried a slight oppressive tone with it. He truly couldn\u2019t understand why Du Qingxi would find a spirit chef apprentice to join their ranks.In the eyes of Duanmu Ze who was born in a wealthy and influential great clan, even though the culinary arts of spirit chefs were great, chefs were only chefs in the end. Their status was essentially still of the same class as lowly servants, how could Chen Xi mix with himself and the others?It was precisely because of this that even though Du Qingxi had instructed him about this matter earlier, and he\u2019d agreed to not fuss about it. But when he really saw Chen Xi, Duanmu Ze still felt extremely displeased in his heart, as if Chen Xi\u2019s appearance brought disgrace to his status.A mere few words caused Chen Xi\u2019s impression of Duanmu Ze to become extremely terrible, and he didn\u2019t care to greet and chat with Duanmu Ze. On the contrary, he instead hoped that Du Qingxi would say that he\u2019s unreliable as well. In this way, he could just leave and he wouldn\u2019t have to stay with this guy who was proud as a peacock.However regrettably, Du Qingxi didn\u2019t act in this way, and she even didn\u2019t pay any attention to Duanmu Ze. Instead, her gaze moved and she pointed at the other young man before continuing to introduce. \u201cSong Lin, from the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Song Clan.\u201dSong Lin actually had a rather handsome appearance, but he obviously was an extremely indolent fellow. He had puffy hair and was slovenly dressed, and his eyes were slightly narrowed. His entire body seemed as if it had fallen apart as he lazily leaned on a large tree within the courtyard with a drowsy look.Song Lin weakly waved his hand towards Chen Xi when he heard Du Qingxi introducing him, then muttered, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard Qingxi talk about you, but wait for me to finish sleeping, then we can chat properly\u2026\u201d As he spoke, his head kept drooping and he once again entered dreamland.As he thought about this, Chen Xi\u2019s heart jerked as he suddenly realized something,There was an extremely high probability for this.Birds of a feather flock together. Looking at the attitude Du Qingxi had when facing Duanmu Ze and Song Lin, they were obviously people of the same kind, but only their characters were different.Chen Xi wondered in his heart and he suddenly felt that his trip to the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain this time seemed to not be as simple as he had imagined.\u201cQingxi, you really want to take him along?\u201dDuanmu Ze couldn\u2019t help but be infuriated in his heart when he saw Du Qingxi ignore him, but his face still had a magnanimous appearance as he frowned and said, \u201cI heard demon beasts roam freely within the Southern Barbaric Mountain range, and it\u2019s full of danger. If by any chance we encounter some unforeseen event, then wouldn\u2019t it be a harm to his life?\u201dChen Xi kept silent, but he couldn\u2019t help but sigh in his heart.\u201cAre you finished?\u201d Du Qingxi said with an expressionless face.Duanmu Ze\u2019s expression froze, then he had a serious expression as he said, \u201cQingxi, I\u2019m thinking for him.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re finished, then let\u2019s go.\u201d Du Qingxi was still completely indifferent as she turned and left.Chen Xi followed her when he saw this, as he wasn\u2019t willing to stay together with Duanmu Ze. Who knew what sort of displeasing words this fellow would say in his anger?The light smile that hung on the corners of Duanmu Ze\u2019s mouth instantly vanished when he saw the two of them leave the courtyard successively, and his expression became unusually unsightly.\u201cOh, let\u2019s go as well.\u201d Song Lin rubbed his sleepy eyes as he weakly yawned.Duanmu Ze\u2019s face sank and forced out a line of words from the cracks in his teeth. \u201cLet me see if Du Qingxi will turn against me for the sake of a lowly servant!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - Icetail BeePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34 - Icetail BeeEvery three years, the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain would appear within the Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area.If one wanted to the find the entrance to the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, then one must traverse through vast expanses of forests that demon beasts roamed in and enter the forbidden area. There was even a high probability that one would encounter a greater demon that stayed within, thus it could be said that killing intent was concealed at every corner and it was extremely dangerous.Now, along with the upcoming appearance of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, the pedestrian traffic on the bustling streets of Pine Mist City was obviously a few times busier than before, and they crowded and bustled like a tide that seemed incomparably clamorous.\u201cLaurel City, Jade City, Sandrop City\u2026 It seems that the cultivators from all the cities in the southern territory have appeared. The Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials this time is simply an unprecedentedly grand occasion!\u201d\u201cWell, who said it wasn\u2019t? I wonder what the General\u2019s Estate was thinking, actually tacitly consenting to cultivators from outside the city being able to participate. Not to mention anything else, but solely for the sake of fighting for the shockingly valuable baleful pearls, the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials this time will absolutely not be peaceful.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. But I heard people saying that most people seem to not have come solely for the sake of the baleful pearls. They seem to want to seek some sort of sword immortal\u2019s abode within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. I wonder if it\u2019s true or not?\u201d\u201cSword immortal\u2019s abode? Pfft! Stop joking! The spirit energy in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain is exhausted and baleful qi billows in the sky. Which sword immortal would be so bored as to build his abode there?\u201d\u2026All along the way, various discussions filled the streets, extremely alike to the strange atmosphere when a storm is brewing.\u201cThe Southern Barbaric Nether Domain will appear tomorrow, and the entrance will only be open for six hours. So, we must hurry there overnight.\u201dDu Qingxi took out a jade-slip map when they walked up before the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, then she briefly looked through it before saying with a serious expression, \u201cEveryone, be careful. Demon beasts roam about within the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range at night and it\u2019s extremely dangerous. Don\u2019t let your guard down.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Qingxi. Even if we encounter a Violet Palace Realm greater demon, the strength of the three of us would be sufficient to kill it.\u201d Duanmu Ze lightly smiled as he spoke with a casual tone as if he was speaking of an extremely simple matter.Chen Xi\u2019s heart shook, since this fellow dared speak so highly, his strength should have surely already advanced to the Violet Palace Realm, and Du Qingxi and Song Lin would presumably be no different.This question related to certain secrets and Chen Xi wasn\u2019t familiar with the three of them. So, it wasn\u2019t good for him to inquire further and he could only conceal it within his heart.Darkness enveloped the sky and scattered stars studded the sky.Looking down from the sky, countless streams of people were like rows upon rows of ants as they poured towards the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, and a rough estimate put them at not less than 10,000 people.\u201cEh, I\u2019m not seeing things right? Duanmu Ze who\u2019s reputed to be a genius level figure in the Dragon Lake City\u2019s younger generation had actually come as well?\u201d\u201cYou aren\u2019t mistaken, that person is definitely Duanmu Ze. He supposedly already possesses a cultivation at the 4th star Violet Palace Realm, and he might become the next successor of the Duanmu Clan.\u201d\u201cWow! So he\u2019s the Duanmu Ze of my dreams. Sure enough, he\u2019s as handsome and extraordinary as the rumors say, simply too handsome!\u201d\u2026Right when Chen Xi\u2019s group of four intended to enter the mountain, someone nearby recognized Duanmu Ze and it instantly caused a wave of praise and surprised exclamations.Duanmu Ze\u2019s handsome face revealed a slight smile with a trace of complacency. He\u2019d been accustomed to seeing such a scene in Dragon Lake City since long ago, so he didn\u2019t think anything of it and smiled to Du Qingxi who was beside him. \u201cI never expected to be recognized so quickly, these people really have nothing better to do.\u201d\u201cSince they have nothing better to do, then let\u2019s leave quickly,\u201d said Du Qingxi with her regular expression that was frosty like snow, as if everything in the surroundings were unable to arouse her interest.Duanmu Ze was stunned, then he shook his head and smiled, yet in his heart he was secretly extremely furious.He\u2019d been chasing afar Du Qingxi all along, but Du Qingxi\u2019s disposition was too cold, and he\u2019d tried many different methods that all ended in failure.To a disciple of a well-known clan like him, he could obtain numerous beautiful women if he wanted, but in the eyes of Duanmu Ze, those women were all just ordinary women. Within the entire Dragon Lake City, only a few people were worthy of him, and Du Qingxi who was born of the Du Clan was undoubtedly one of them.Du Qingxi\u2019s appearance was extremely beautiful and she was exceedingly intelligent. Most importantly, she was the only daughter of the Du Clan\u2019s Patriarch. If he were to marry her, then not only would he obtain a beauty, but he would also be able to obtain the support of the Du Clan, and to Duanmu Ze, this was the result he wanted the most.Because becoming the son-in-law of the Du Clan was equivalent to obtaining the support of the entire Du Clan, and relying on this assistance, Duanmu Ze had complete confidence in being able to ascend the position of Patriarch of the Duanmu Clan.So, although he took a blow from Du Qingxi\u2019s cold attitude now, Duanmu Ze would absolutely not put out his thoughts of going after Du Qingxi because of this.But he was still slightly displeased in his heart, especially because Chen Xi was watching nearby.Duanmu Ze glanced at Chen Xi but noticed that this fellow was absent-minded, with an appearance that he was daydreaming, and completely gave Duanmu Ze no opportunity to find fault with him. For a time, Duanmu Ze gnashed his teeth in hatred and thought inwardly,The night grew darker and darker, like black ink had enveloped the entire Southern Barbaric Mountain Range. Waves of terrifying beast roars sounded from afar, adding an aura of slaughter that caused one\u2019s heart to palpitate.When faced with this scene, even Song Lin whose eyes were heavy with sleep all the way couldn\u2019t help but open, and his gaze was shining with unusual brightness.A strand of a voice transmission entered into his ears, and Chen Xi raised his eyes to look over. Chen Xi saw Duanmu Ze looking over with a light smile on his face as if the words from before didn\u2019t originate from him at all.When faced with this sort of disdainful and threatening provocation, Chen Xi chose to directly disregard it.When he recalled the scene of him hunting those ferocious and crafty demon beasts every night for the past three months, Chen Xi was instead filled with pity towards Duanmu Ze.After they entered the mountain, Duanmu Ze led the group for the sake of showing his gentlemanliness. His white clothes fluttered as he walked forward with a sword in his grasp, and coupled with that handsome and refined smile of his, he indeed was able to arouse adoration in most girls.Du Qingxi didn\u2019t object to it, Song Lin had always sleepily and wearily followed at the back of the group, and it was impossible that Chen Xi would seize the limelight from this attention seeking Young Master.So, all along the way, Duanmu Ze seemed to take himself to be the leading figure of the group. Chen Xi had suggested he change the path many times but was flatly refused by him, as according to the way he said it. \u201cEven if there\u2019s no path, sword cultivators must still use the sword in their hand to carve out a path, and taking a detour isn\u2019t the way a sword cultivator does things\u2026\u201dChen Xi didn\u2019t say anything further, as since someone wanted to suffer misfortune, then no one would be able to stop the person.After that, at a place in the forest that was luxuriant with flowers and trees, a swarm of Icetail Wasps surged out as Chen Xi expected.As a 4th star Violet Palace Realm sword cultivator, Duanmu Ze was naturally unafraid of these little things, and he drew his sword right away. As sword lights splashed out, swift and fierce sword qi seemed as if they were shot out from bows, and within a blink of an eye, more than 100 Icetail Bees were instantly annihilated.\u201cSo it\u2019s a swarm of little bees, truly a disappointing opponent.\u201d Duanmu Ze had a complacent expression as he sighed with emotion. At the moment he intended to put away his sword, his expression suddenly froze and his eyes revealed a sense of astonishment.Numerous red and swollen lumps appeared on the skin of his face and hands, and his handsome face even became like roasted pig head. It was so horrible that one could hardly bear to look at it.\u201cAh!\u201d Duanmu Ze emitted a miserable shrill cry, as the severe itchiness on his skin that was difficult to endure caused him to be unable to take care of his bearing, and his hands fiercely scratched his face.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Du Qingxi was shocked inwardly, and she was extremely bewildered in her heart when she saw Duanmu Ze scratching his itch in an unsightly manner.\u201cOh, Brother Duanmu, are you utilizing monkey boxing?\u201d Song Lin opened up his drowsy eyes and muttered, \u201cI remember that you hate monkey boxing the most. You said that its posture is too ugly and it affects aesthetics and bearing.\u201d\u201cEven though he killed the Icetail Bees, his face and hands were stung by the stingers of the Icetail Bees. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so itchy and unbearable.\u201d Chen Xi frowned as he spoke, yet in his heart, he was instead extremely pleased.These Icetail Bees were the size of a thumb and were fully black. Their stingers were fine like the hair of a cow and crystal clear. When the stinger plunged into the skin of a person, it was like ice merging into water and was impossible to guard against. Moreover, the poison would instantly invade the blood and cause red swellings that were itchy and unbearable to appear on the skin.\u201cSince you knew, then why didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d Du Qingxi coldly glanced over and spoke with a slight blaming tone.\u201cI advised him, but he said that as a sword cultivator, he must use the sword in his hand\u2026\u201dNot waiting for Chen Xi to finish, the far away Duanmu Ze who was scratching his itch suddenly roared. \"Kid, shut up!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019m alright.\u201d Duanmu Ze breathed heavily for a while, then forcefully endured the itchiness on his body as he stood up, and his body trembled as he walked forward.\u201cAlas, Brother Duanmu cares about bearing the most. In Dragon Lake City, Brother Duanmu would undoubtedly be number one in terms of bearing. Now that his appearance has become like this, he surely doesn\u2019t feel well in his heart, right?\u201d Song Lin lazily sighed, and his gaze wittingly or unwittingly glanced at Chen Xi, then his eyes drooped as he once again fell into a sleepy state.\u201cOh, if I knew earlier that he was so afraid of itchiness, I ought to have advised him once more, and all this wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d said Chen Xi with an innocent expression.When this entered Duanmu Ze\u2019s ears, it caused the malicious flames in his heart to rise explosively. Especially when he thought of his unsightly manner fully entering Du Qingxi\u2019s eyes, he was angered to the point he spat out a mouthful of blood, and he roared in his heart.\u201cYoung Master Duanmu, there are still some demon beasts that can\u2019t be considered to be formidable ahead, should we take a detour?\u201d Chen Xi seemed as if he\u2019d been moved by conscience and asked in concern.Duanmu Ze\u2019s body froze, then he replied fiercely, \u201cThank you, but there\u2019s no need!\u201dAs he spoke, seemingly for the sake of venting the rage in his heart, Duanmu Ze quickened his pace. The sword in his hand ceaselessly waved about, and the vines and grass that obstructed his way were instantly transformed into ash.\u201cYou seem to be extremely familiar with this place?\u201d Du Qingxi frowned as she asked.Chen Xi nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve previously come here for a period of time.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you lead the way?\u201d Du Qingxi questioned closely.Chen Xi gazed at the far away Duanmu Ze and didn\u2019t say anything, but what he meant was thoroughly revealed.\u201cYou lead the way after this.\u201d Du Qingxi said with an irrebuttable tone.\u201cOkay!\u201d Chen Xi nodded.AH~Right at this moment, Duanmu Ze\u2019s sad and shrill scream once again sounded out from afar, and his voice revealed boundless rage and terror, seeming to have encountered some sort of terrifying thing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - GatherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 35 - GatherChen Xi wasn\u2019t surprised in the slightest when he heard Duanmu Ze\u2019s shrill cry because there was a soft bog just 33m ahead, and a swarm of rat type demon beasts that were the size of a fist lived underground.Bubble Rats moved beneath the ground with speeds that were swift like the wind, their bodies were like blown up bubbles and which were filled with rotten smelling dark-green poison. Although the toxicity wasn\u2019t high, when spurted onto a person\u2019s body, that rotten stench was absolutely able to cause one to go mad.Most importantly, Bubble Rats were extremely short tempered, and when they encountered an enemy, these disgusting and ugly little things would collectively choose to self-explode. The dark-green colored liquid that exploded out from their bellies was virtually like a rainstorm that blotted out the sky and was impossible to avoid.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Du Qingxi simply couldn\u2019t believe her eyes when she saw Duanmu Ze, he seemed as if he\u2019d been thrown into and soaked in a dye vat. His hair, skin, clothes that were white like snow\u2026 they were all fully smeared with dark-green liquid, and he looked like an extremely ugly toad demon.If they hadn\u2019t seen it with their own eyes, it was absolutely difficult to imagine how the person before them was the handsome and refined Duanmu Ze who wore white clothes that fluttered in the wind.A gust of wind blew over, and a nauseating rotten stench instantly filled every corner of the area.\u201cSo disgusting.\u201d Song Lin was suffocated by the rotten stench in the air to the point he was completely devoid of sleepiness, and he covered his nose as he repeatedly moved back.\u201cHe isn\u2019t in danger, right?\u201d Du Qingxi frowned and asked.Chen Xi shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, just a little smelly.\u201dBlargh~Du Qingxiwas suffocated to the extent she nearly vomited, she didn\u2019t hesitate as she moved far off right away, then said, \u201cDuanmu, quickly change your clothes and leave this place.\u201d\u201cYou all\u2026 How can you all be like this!?\u201dDuanmu Ze\u2019s eyes opened wide as he looked at Du Qingxi and Song Lin who stayed far away from him in dejection, and his voice revealed dense patheticness that made him seem like an abandoned widow.\u201cYoung Master Duanmu, I already warned you earlier, but you didn\u2019t listen to me\u2026 Alas, you should hurry up and change your clothes, it\u2019s really extremely smelly.\u201d Chen Xi shook his head then turned around and left.Duanmu Ze seemed as if he was struck by lightning, and he was stunned for a short moment before he let out an exceedingly furious low howl.Duanmu Ze was angered to the point he started breathing heavily, but he nearly fainted at the instant he smelt the stench on his body, and a wave of explosive rage once again broke out in his heart as he completely hated Chen Xi to the bones.When Duanmu Ze appeared once again, he\u2019d already recovered his handsome appearance, but his expression was extremely gloomy as he stared at Chen Xi with a murderous gaze.Chen Xi shook his head and directly disregarded Duanmu Ze\u2019s gaze as he walked forward.Duanmu Ze was silent all along the way, and under Chen Xi\u2019s lead, no other accidents occurred again.Du Qingxi followed from behind and the surprise in her heart grew deeper and deeper. Along the way, they\u2019d encountered some formidable demon beasts more than once, but Chen Xi seemed as if he had foresight and would bring their group to carefully circumnavigate around it to safely get by every time.She had to admit that she\u2019d indeed look down upon Chen Xi because it was occasionally even difficult for her to notice those demon beasts that were adept in concealment.Whereas in the heart of Duamu Ze, Chen Xi\u2019s display of understanding the surrounding environment like the back of his hand caused Duanmu Ze to deem that everything that happened earlier was something Chen Xi intentionally did to cause him to make a fool of himself. For a time, the hatred Duanmu Ze had towards Chen Xi was simply to the extent it was like a deep ravine, and if it wasn\u2019t for Du Qingxi being present, he would absolutely kill Chen Xi at the first possible moment.When daybreak was at hand, Chen Xi\u2019s group had finally passed through the forest that was like a screen of nature and entered into the Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area to appear before an enormous lake.Chen Xi naturally recognized that this vast and boundless lake was called Spiritcave Lake, as the first Congenital Realm greater demon he\u2019d killed with his own two hands was precisely the two-headed Violet Rhino that had cultivated for thousands of years and stayed at the center of the lake.At this moment, no less than tens of thousands of cultivators had already gathered by Spiritcave Lake, and wherever his gaze went, it was dense with people. Noisy sounds of discussion rose and fell, and it seemed to be extremely bustling.\u201cThe entrance to the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain wouldn\u2019t be atop Spiritcave Lake right?\u201d Chen Xi looked at the far away crowd and felt slightly surprised.\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Du Qingxi seemed to be even more surprised than Chen Xi.Chen Xi shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never participated in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials and I\u2019ve never paid attention to the information about this.\u201d\u201cHa! As a disciple of Pine Mist City, you\u2019ve actually never even participated in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials. You\u2019re really pitiable.\u201d Duanmu Ze cut in with a tone that revealed intense disdain.Chen Zi glanced at the fellow then said indifferently, \u201cAlthough I haven't entered the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain before, I understand how to traverse the southern barbaric mountain forest.\u201dDuanmu Ze was stunned then he recalled his encounter with the Icetail Bees and Bubble Rats. It was as if a scar in his heart was torn open, and his expression instantly became extremely gloomy as he said word for word, \u201cI hope your cultivation is as formidable as your mouth, you\u2019d better not die in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.\u201dThese words were equivalent to thoroughly and openly breaking the relations between him and Chen Xi.Du Qingxi frowned as she glanced at the two of them before saying coldly, \u201cEnough! If the two of you are still going to be like this when we enter the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, then please leave now!\u201dDuanmu Ze curled his lips but said no more, he was obviously afraid Du Qingxi would send him packing.Chen Xi wished for nothing more than to leave, but when he saw Du Qingxi\u2019s extremely icy cold expression and recalled the three-year agreement he\u2019d signed with her, he instead hesitated to speak.Their group hastened their pace and after tens of minutes, they\u2019d appeared in the empty space by Spiritcave Lake.Only after they approached did Chen Xi notice that all these cultivators were mostly gathered in groups of three or five, and they all held weapons in their embrace as they stood there with vigilant expressions. Obviously, within the extremely dangerous Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, although they were all competitors, for the sake preventing those formidable demon beasts from rushing out, everyone took the same decision to gather together.After all, the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain hadn\u2019t appeared yet, and it wasn\u2019t the time to openly offend each other to seize the baleful pearls.The appearance of Chen Xi\u2019s group attracted the attention of most of the people in the surroundings. The reason was extremely simple, the handsome Duanmu Ze standing there was like a flag. So long as it was a cultivator that had lived in Dragon Lake City, how would they be unable to recognize that this young man of extraordinary bearing was the outstanding figure from the Duanmu Clan\u2019s younger generation, Duanmu Ze?\u201cSo it\u2019s Young Master Duanmu!\u201d\u201cAH! Young Master Duanmu has come as well!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Duanmu, I never expected I would be able to see you here!\u201d\u2026All along the way, the sounds of greeting Duanmu Ze ceaselessly lingered in their ears, and the gazes that originally held slight hostility to Chen Xi\u2019s group had been withdrawn. The name of the Duanmu Clan was so great that it could be considered as a colossus in the entire southern territory, and ordinary cultivators didn\u2019t have to courage to offend the Duanmu Clan.At this moment, Duanmu Ze\u2019s face revealed a wisp of his usual slight smile that revealed sufficient pride within his complacency, and relying on the blinding halo above his head, their group of four smoothly picked an extremely good spot.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but sigh with emotion in his heart when he saw this.Duanmu Ze\u2019s mood seemed to be much better after being flattered by the surrounding people, then he glanced at Chen Xi who sat cross-legged and said with a frown, \u201cHey! You\u2019re a spirit chef that\u2019s really not up to standard, can\u2019t you see that everyone\u2019s walked for an entire night?\u201dChen Xi directly disregarded the fellow and looked at Du Qingxi. \u201cDo you need to eat something?\u201dDu Qingxi thought for a moment then nodded. When she walked out of the forest, she wore a black veil on her head that was able to cut off being observed by the energy of the soul, and it covered her appearance, causing others to be unable to see her expression.Only now did Chen Xi stand up, he withdrew some ingredients from his storage ring before igniting a spirit flame and started cooking.This storage ring was given to him by Du Qingxi when they left Clear Stream Restaurant, within it was an entire 330m of space that was piled with hills of ingredients. If they ate sparingly, it would be sufficient for a few people to eat for two to three years.Duanmu Ze didn\u2019t mind in the slightest when being ignored by Chen Xi, as being able to make Chen Xi cook under the gazes of everyone present had already achieved his goal.He wanted everyone to know that Chen Xi was only a spirit chef of low status that followed by his side, and wasn\u2019t like how it seemed on the surface, a friend that could be conversed with.At this moment, when he saw Chen Xi starting to cook, Duanmu Ze couldn\u2019t help but start anticipating.However, what disappointed Duanmu Ze was that although the surrounding people frequently shot over gazes of surprise, bewilderment, enlightenment, and disdain, Chen Xi\u2019s expression remained the same from the beginning until the end.Not long after, a pot of Hundred Treasures Porridge that was cooked from over 100 types of spirit fruits mixed with five cereal spirit grains[1. The five cereals represents rice, beans, wheat, and two types of millet.] was ready, and an enticing fragrance of porridge brought along traces of fresh fruity smell as it curled upwards and drifted to the surroundings.Grrr~ Grrr~Sounds of stomachs growling echoed out from the surroundings. Most of the cultivators here were all around the Congenital Realm and were still unable to survive on spirit energy like Violet Palace Realm cultivators, so they brought along dried rations when they came here. But when they smelt the delicious fragrance of the porridge that was fresh out of the pot, who wouldn\u2019t covet it? Even their stomachs wouldn\u2019t agree if they did!\u201cYoung Master Duanmu is really someone that ordinary people can\u2019t compare to, he even brought a spirit chef when he came out for a trip. This quality of living is truly enviable!\u201d\u201cOf course! Just by smelling the fragrance of that porridge, you can absolutely know that youth is at least at the standard of a 2 leaf spirit chef!\u201d\u2026Duanmu Ze felt even happier in his heart when he heard this, and he picked up a white napkin and covered his leg with a complacent expression, then he instructed. \u201cFill a bowl of porridge for me.\u201dChen Xi was holding a bowl of porridge and eating, and he muttered in reply, \u201cThere\u2019s no more.\u201dThere was indeed no more, after giving Du Qingxi and himself a bowl each, a large bowl was taken by Song Lin who was like the reincarnation of a hungry ghost, and the bottom of the pot had already been scraped clean.Duanmu Ze lowered his head and gazed at the napkin that he\u2019d prepared on his leg, then looked at the empty pot, and his expression constantly changed and was incomparably brilliant.\u201cOh, this porridge is good. What\u2019s rare is it has an entirely different taste and is not one bit inferior to the head spirit chef at my home.\u201d Song Lin gulped down large mouthfuls of porridge with a face of intoxication and satisfaction, and would occasionally emit a slurping sound.\u201cThis porridge is surely something he developed himself. It has a sweet taste and glutinous texture that\u2019s different from normal, and it contains pure spirit energy that is condensed and doesn\u2019t dissipate until it\u2019s been eaten. It\u2019s indeed not bad.\u201d Du Qingxi nodded as she judged.Duanmu Ze\u2019s expression went even more unsightly when he saw the two of them didn\u2019t have any intention of supporting him and were instead evaluating the taste of the Hundred Treasures Porridge with great interest.\u201cEh! That\u2019s\u2026\u201dRight at this moment, a commotion arose in the crowd and the gazes of everyone shot towards the distance.Du Qingxi raised her head and glanced over before withdrawing her gaze, and she said with a calm expression, \u201cSo it\u2019s that girl from the Su Clan. I knew she wouldn\u2019t miss the opportunity this time.\u201dChen Xi\u2019s heart abruptly shook tremendously, and he quickly raised his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - Numerous ExpertsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36 - Numerous ExpertsA mere two words caused the hatred and rage that had accumulated within Chen Xi\u2019s heart for many years to be instantly lit ablaze.The scene from he was four years old was still vivid in his mind. 13 Su Clan Golden Hall Realm cultivators tore apart the marriage contract between him and the Su Clan\u2019s Young Miss before the eyes of everyone in Pine Mist City.He still remembered the emotionless and icy cold mocking and ridicule of those Su Clan Golden Hall Realm cultivators.He still remembered that when his grandfather saw the marriage contract being torn in pieces that flew about in the sky, his grandfather's aged face revealed an expression of pain and despair.Furthermore, his grandfather had died miserably outside the city gate three months ago, and the Soundsaver Talisman Chen Hao gave him even allowed Chen Xi to deduce that perhaps the one responsible for assassinating his grandfather might be the Li Clan, but the one behind the scenes that were truly responsible was absolutely the Su Clan.Chen Xi didn\u2019t know the reason behind it, but he knew that his grandfather had died in the hands of the Su Clan, and this was already sufficient!\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Du Qingxi perceptively noticed that Chen Xi\u2019s aura seemed to become restless.Chen Xi took a deep breath and awoke from his monstrous hatred, then shook his head.Shriek!It was the crack of dawn and rows of clouds that were like fish scales floated atop the sky. Extremely far in the distance, accompanied by a long and clear cry of a crane, the clouds and mist seemed to have been dispersed by an awl. An extraordinary and robust white crane flapped its wings, and as it broke through the clouds and approached with an extremely swift speed.Whoosh!In practically the blink of an eye, a white crane that was fully snow white like jade appeared in the sky above everyone, and it fluttered its wings as it let out a clear cry.The gazes of everyone gathered onto the white crane at the first possible moment, and a young girl in a black dress that had an incomparably delicate and charming appearance stood there with her hands behind her back. She had lovely hair that was fluffy like clouds and an elegant figure, and that disposition of hers that seemed like she would be blown away by the wind caused many people to be secretly enchanted.Song Lin laid on the floor and lazily opened his eyes, and he glanced at the young girl that rode atop the white crane before lightly muttering, \u201cOh, Duanmu, your Miss Su has arrived.\u201dDuanmu Ze glanced at Du Qingxi who was beside him and the corners of his mouth twitched, and he furiously howled in a low voice. \u201cWhat do you mean by my Miss Su? What relationship does she, Su Jiao, have with me?\u201dSong Lin curled his lips in contempt, and Song Lin was just about to say something when Duanmu Ze extended his hand to cover Song Lin\u2019s mouth, then Duanmu Ze smiled embarrassedly to the nearby Du Qingxi. \u201cThis fellow is sleep talking again.\u201dDu Qingxi paid no attention to Duanmu Ze\u2019s explanation. On her beautiful face that was covered beneath her veil, her pair of deep and starry eyes continuously looked at Chen Xi, and her beautiful brows slightly frowned and seemed to have thought of something.At this moment, Chen Xi had his head lowered, causing others to be unable to see his expression. But under Du Qingxi\u2019s close gaze, she still noticed the slight trembling of his body, and he seemed to be forcefully suppressing the violently fluctuating feelings in his heart.\u201cAt the moment Su Jiao appeared, his mind became unusually disordered, could it be\u2026 Right! The girl Chen Xi was betrothed to that year is surely Su Jiao without a doubt!\u201dA flash of wisdom appeared within Du Qingxi\u2019s mind, she recalled the various rumors about Chen Xi in Pine Mist City, and finally understood what was going on. She couldn\u2019t help but faintly sigh in her heart.\u201cIt\u2019s the Eldest Young Miss of the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan!\u201d\u201cAh! So she\u2019s the Miss Su that\u2019s one of the twin prides of Dragon Lake City? No wonder she\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d\u201cHmph! She\u2019s more than beautiful! Miss Su\u2019s cultivation is extremely extraordinary, otherwise, how could she become eminent within Dragon Lake City where experts are as numerous as the clouds and obtain the distinction of being one of the twin prides of Dragon Lake City in one go?\u201d\u2026At this moment, everyone by Spiritcave Lake recognized Su Jiao\u2019s identity, and the discussion didn\u2019t lack exclamations of shock, admiration, and adoration.In mid-air, Su Jiao had an indifferent expression, as if she didn\u2019t feel the ferventness of everyone below, and she shot her gaze towards the distance.Gradually, everyone was attracted by her actions, and their gazes shot towards the same direction in succession.\u201cHahaha! I\u2019ve kept Miss Su waiting!\u201d After a short moment, accompanied by a loud laughter that was like a thunderclap, a blood red light whistled out from deep within the cloudy sky, and a ferocious imposing manner instantly filled the heaven and the earth.The hearts of everyone shook as they felt this formidable imposing manner that was arrogant and unruly, and their expressions fluctuated between surprize and bewilderment.The blood red light swiftly came to a stop and only now did everyone clearly see the appearance of the person. This person wore a black robe with gold embroidery, he had a wide chest and broad nose, and thick long hair hung down to his shoulders. He stood atop a sword that was dark red like fresh blood, and a fierce and unruly imposing manner shot into the sky as he openly declared his strength to everyone.\u201cRedlotus Bloodsoul Sword! He\u2019s the Little Sword Devil, Cang Bin! The sword cultivating genius of the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Cang Clan!\u201dSomeone exclaimed in surprize, and it instantly caused an uproar. \u00a0As they looked at the black robed figure that stood atop the blood red sword in mid-air, their gazes were filled with fear and reverence.Chen Xi who was lost in thought was jolted awake as well. He raised his head to glance at the black robed figure that stood mid-air and his formidable soul allowed him to see more things than what others could.\u201cOh, Duanmu, your old rival has come as well. Your Miss Su will be seized away by him if you still don\u2019t make a move.\u201dSong Lin\u2019s lazy voice once again vaguely came out from his mouth, and the veins on Duanmu Ze\u2019s forehead thumped as he gnashed his teeth and said, \u201cI\u2019ll say it one more time, she isn\u2019t my Miss Su, the one I like is\u2026\u201dThe two words \u2018Qingxi\u2019 hadn\u2019t even left his mouth when Duanmu Ze suddenly saw Du Qingxi coldly glaring at him. His heart trembled as he forcefully swallowed back what he was about to say, and he had an extremely embarrassed expression.Chen Xi paid no attention to all this, as his attention had already been drawn by the discussions that sounded out from afar.\u201cStrange, why have so many Violet Palace Realm cultivators come today? Only Congenital Realm cultivators and below are able to enter the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.\u201d\u201cIt is extremely strange. Not only are there numerous Violet Palace Realm cultivators here for the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials this year, even cultivators from outside of Pine Mist City occupy half the amount of people. Such a spectacular scene is simply unprecedented in the past!\u201d\u201cPfft! What\u2019s there to feel strange about? Violet Palace Realm cultivators only require an Essenceseal Pill and they\u2019d be able to lower their cultivation by a realm to maintain it at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm. Entering the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain is a piece of cake.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be? If they were to participate then wouldn\u2019t we Congenital Realm cultivators be unable to obtain even a single baleful pearl?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the backgrounds of these Violet Palace Realm cultivators are extremely great. Would they care about these baleful pearls with their statuses? Their objective is surely that sword immortals abode that\u2019s given rise to much discussion. Even if it isn\u2019t, they\u2019re surely here for something else. Anyhow, they\u2019re surely not here for baleful pearls.\u201d\u2026Chen Xi was originally still wondering about this matter. Now, when he heard the surrounding discussion, he couldn\u2019t help but come to a sudden understanding, then he frowned.What made Chen Xi feel shocked inwardly the most was that just currently, he\u2019d seen Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, Song Lin, Su Jiao, and Cang Bin; five leading figures of the younger generation of Dragon Lake City, and their backgrounds were all formidable like the others. Then how many other experts with terrifying strengths were concealed in the shadows?\u201cBrother Cang, let\u2019s go down and wait as well. The Southern Barbaric Nether Domain will appear in approximately 15 minutes.\u201d Su Jiao lightly nodded to Cang Bin in mid-air and her gaze that was calm and emotionless like water swept downwards. She quickly found her target, then she lightly descended.\u201cIf you insist.\u201d Cang Bin laughed as he put away his Redlotus Bloodsoul sword and followed her to flash downwards.Amongst the two of them, one had an indifferent disposition, the other was arrogant and unruly, and their cultivation and identity were extremely shocking. The moment they hit the ground, the crowd consciously opened a path for the two of them to pass.Su Jiao paid no attention to the gazes of ardent adoration that were shot at her from the surroundings and she directly walked to the location of Chen Xi\u2019s group of four before stopping and smiling sweetly. \u201cBrother Duanmu, Brother Song, I never expected that the two of you would be here as well.\u201d\u201cMiss Su, aren\u2019t you here as well?\u201d Duanmu Ze stood up and lightly smiled as he said. He wore his usual white clothes and was handsome. When he spoke at this moment, his elegant demeanor did indeed attain a level that caused others to be unable to find fault with it.Compared to Cang Bin who was by Su Jiao\u2019s side, their temperament and appearances were different, but they both emitted an imposing manner of strong confidence that was evenly matched.\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sleepy. All of you chat.\u201d Song Lin was completely indifferent instead, and he still laid there like a pug as he muttered before his eyelids drooped down once again and he slept soundly while snoring loudly.Compared to Duanmu Ze and Cang Bin, the tired and sloppy Song Lin was simply not like a person that had come from one of the six great clans of Dragon Lake City\u2019s, the Song Clan!Su Jiao lightly smiled then turned to look at Du Qingxi whose face was covered by a black veil. \u201cBig Sister Qingxi, you\u2019ve come for the sword immortal\u2019s abode as well?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d While her voice that was frosty like ice sounded out, Du Qingxi stretched out her hand to remove the black veil that covered her head to reveal that chilly and extremely beautiful face of hers. Her starry eyes were clear like water and her cherry lips were rosy, and her pure white face was like a fully bloomed lotus that was exceedingly beautiful.At the moment the surrounding people saw Du Qingxi\u2019s appearance, they were all dumbstruck and were fiercely surprised by her beauty.\u201cOf course it is, otherwise, why would Big Sister Qingxi come and stay at this little Pine Mist City for so long?\u201d Su Jiao lightly smiled. \u201cBut, there\u2019s only one sword immortal\u2019s abode, and for the sake of obtaining it, I won\u2019t make any compromises.\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s like that, then we\u2019ll use that to decide on the winner in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.\u201d Du Qingxi replied in an extremely straightforward manner, her voice was chilly as usual and carried a sense of having made a decision to kill.\u201cThat\u2019s what I intended as well.\u201d Su Jiao grinned as she replied, then she shot her gaze towards the side. There, Chen Xi sat cross-legged.Along with the appearance of Su Jiao and Cang Bin, the people in the surroundings had shot their gazes over already. Duanmu Ze had arrived early on, and everyone already knew his identity. Moreover, along with Su Jiao calling out Du Qingxi\u2019s name, then seeing that beautiful and refined appearance of Du Qingxi, most people were able to guess that this woman was surely the favored genius from the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Du Clan. Du Qingxi that was called one of the twin prides of Dragon Lake City with Su Jiao!As for Song Lin, just by hearing his name, they knew. This tired and drowsy fellow was surely from the Song Clan of the six great clans of Dragon Lake City.Su Clan, Cang Clan, Duanmu Clan, Du Clan, Song Clan\u2026 Five young men and women who were all respectively from one of the six great clans of Dragon Lake City. Moreover, they were all the most outstanding figures in the younger generation who were flourishing in the limelight. How could the people present normally see such a grand line-up?So at this moment, when they saw Su Jiao casting her gaze at Chen Xi, the people present couldn\u2019t help but guess in their hearts.At this moment, Chen Xi who sat cross-legged on the ground had undoubtedly become the center of attention for everyone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Southern Barbaric Nether DomainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37 - Southern Barbaric Nether DomainSu Jiao\u2019s gaze was indifferent and tranquil as she quietly sized up the youth before her. Her expression was similarly calm, and caused others to be unable to perceive what she thought in her heart.\u201cYou\u2019re Chen Xi?\u201d After a short while, Su Jiao slowly spoke with a voice that carried a trace of condescending arrogance.At the moment her words echoed out, the surrounding people were all confused and only those people that came from Pine Mist City revealed a trace of astonishment when they heard this name.Who in Pine Mist City didn\u2019t know the great name of Chen Xi the jinx?It was precisely because they knew this that they felt astonished when they saw Chen Xi actually being together with the disciples from the great clans of Dragon Lake City.\u201cFuck! Why\u2019s the jinx here? Isn\u2019t he a loser that only knows how to craft talismans? Why\u2019s he participating in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials as well?\u201d Someone felt that it was difficult to believe.\u201cAH! I\u2019ve finally recalled it. He hid behind Young Master Duanmu earlier and all of us were drawn by Young Master Duanmu\u2019s elegant demeanor, so we overlooked this fellow.\u201d Someone seized this opportunity to flatter Duanmu Ze.\u201cIt can\u2019t be! How could someone that\u2019s able to be called out by name by a figure like Miss Su be an ordinary person? Hey, buddy, who exactly is this Chen Xi?\u201d The cultivators from outside Pine Mist City were extremely curious and they all started to inquire about Chen Xi\u2019s identity.\u201cHaha! All of you are too young, and you\u2019re all talking fucking rubbish! Let me tell all of you, that Miss Su was betrothed to Chen Xi all those years ago. It was approximately when he was four\u2026\u201d Someone started brazenly talking about the scene of Chen Xi\u2019s marriage contract being torn apart all those years ago.Chen Xi kept silent as he heard the bustling sounds of discussion from the surroundings, and his expression was extremely calm as if everything in the surroundings wasn't related to him.\u201cEh, jinx? This isn\u2019t real right?\u201d Duanmu Ze feigned astonishment, and the pleasure and ridicule in his eyes were something that was clear for all to see.\u201cI never imagined that Miss Su had such a past with him.\u201d Cang Bin who had his hands crossed before him glanced at Chen Xi in surprize and his eyes emitted dense disdain and contempt. \u201cBut if it was me, I would surely not marry trash like this.\u201dUnder the mocking and ridicule from the surroundings, Chen Xi stood up and stared at Su Jiao as he abruptly asked, \u201cYou\u2019re related to my grandfather\u2019s death, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Su Jiao was stunned then her expression went cold and she said with a frown, \u201cDoes the death of your grandfather have anything to do with me?\u201d\u201cDare to do the deed, but not admit it?\u201d Chen Xi continued to pursue in question.Su Jiao was extremely furious in her heart from being interrogated by Chen Xi, and she said word by word, \u201cDo you think I would explain myself to trash from an impoverished family? You need to understand that the marriage contract between our clans doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Now, even if I kill you, I don\u2019t have to worry about facing any trouble. Do you understand?\u201dA trace of contempt flashed at bottom of Su Jiao\u2019s eyes when she saw Chen Xi keeping silent, and her tone was even more unbridled. \u201cIn any case, even if I killed your grandfather, what can you do with your little strength?\u201d\u201cRemember, the weak will never have the right to speak. Being in an impoverished family is an inherent shortcoming and mediocre ability is an acquired shortcoming. You have both of them! But you still dare speak to me in this way? Truly laughable and stupid!\u201d\u201cIf you still dare speak to me in this way when I see you again, then I\u2019ll surely kill you!\u201dAfter she finished speaking, Su Jiao turned around and left with Cang Bin, and when she left, a slight indifferent smile still hung on her delicate and charming face like a triumphant queen.\u201cMiss Su, leave Chen Xi to me, I\u2019ll surely teach him a good lesson until you\u2019re satisfied.\u201d A clear voice vaguely sounded out in the distance.\u201cThank you for your concern, Young Master Li Huai. But the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain is more important, just temporarily leave other things be.\u201dChen Xi suddenly raised his head and looked at the handsome young man in the far away crowd, and he muttered in his heart.\u201cAre you ok?\u201d This was the second time that Du Qingxi had asked Chen Xi the same question.Chen Xi shook his head and his expression returned to normal. Since he was young, he\u2019d encountered innumerable amounts of ridicule and mocking. This little blow from Su Jiao didn\u2019t cause him to feel wronged or furious.On the contrary, because he saw Li Huai and Su Jiao together, it caused him to be even more certain that the death of his grandfather was absolutely related to the powers that backed these two people!Du Qingxi didn\u2019t say anything further because the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain was about to appear.Om!After a short moment, a strange fluctuation suddenly sounded out in the surroundings of Spiritcave Lake. The originally calm surface of the lake seemed as if thousands of bombs were thrown into it, and enormous waves that were 30 over meters high surged out with a bang.The enormous waves billowed like numerous 30 plus meter long water dragons that swam about and roared, and the spirit energy of heaven and earth was thrown into chaos by these violent fluctuations. Currents of air whistled as they blew out as if a gale had risen.Whoosh!The gazes of everyone present was attracted by this scene.\u201cThe Southern Barbaric Nether Domain is about to appear. Everyone, stand back!\u201dRight when this voice finished sounding out, the hundred plus water dragons formed from waves had coiled together above Spiritcave Lake and formed an enormous vortex that revolved crazily.At practically the same time, a monstrous suction force surged out from the vortex, and the spirit energy within a domain of 50km from Spiritcave Lake was instantly swallowed up. The dark-green grass and trees withered with a speed that was visible to the eye, and a cultivator nearby to Spiritcave Lake that didn\u2019t retreat in time was instantly sucked into the vortex. His body transformed into a clump of blood that instantly vanished.\u201cWatch out! Once you\u2019re sucked in by the vortex, you\u2019ll be instantly minced into scraps even if you\u2019re a Golden Core Realm cultivator.\u201dActually, there was no need for a warning. When everyone present watched the earlier scene, they\u2019d long since retreated more than 100m, and only when they felt the vortex was of no threat did they stand still with a lingering fear in their hearts.Crackle!The violent sounds of thunderclaps abruptly sounded within the sky, and an astonishing scene appeared. The sky behind the enormous vortex seemed to have been crushed by the hands of a god, it crumbled inch by inch and a large \u2018door\u2019 that black lights rolled about on had gradually condensed into form.Along with the appearance of this \u2018door,\u2019 the terrifying suction force disappeared and the heaven and earth returned to normal.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d A figure took the lead to flash explosively towards the \u2018door.\u2019When the others saw this, how could they be willing to fall behind? So they transformed into numerous black silhouettes that swarmed towards that \u2018door.\u2019\u201cBig Sister Qingxi, little sister will be going first.\u201d Su Jiao turned around and laughed with a crisp voice. The white crane beneath her feet flapped its wings and they disappeared within the \u2018door\u2019 with a whoosh. Cang Bin and Li Huai stood on flying swords as they followed her to enter the \u2018door.\u2019\u201cLet\u2019s go in as well. This door that leads to the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain will only remain for 15 minutes, and the next time it appears will be after a month.\u201d Not long after Su Jiao\u2019s group left, Du Qingxi brought Chen Xi and the others to enter the \u2018door.\u2019Om!After 15 minutes, the vicinity of Spiritcave Lake was completely devoid of people, and the large \u2018door\u2019 above the lake suddenly vanished and the shattered sky returned to normal.Crackle!Not long after the large \u2018door\u2019 that headed to the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain disappeared, the sky above the bank of Spiritcave Lake was torn open like cloth, and a two slender and white hands extended out.Subsequently, a tall violet robed young man walked out of the crack in the sky with even steps, and he rubbed his chin as he gazed above Spiritcave Lake, seeming to have thought of something.The sun shone onto his face, and his features that were well-defined seemed to have been carefully carved by a sculptor. He was unusually handsome with a fierce gaze, and there seemed to be two balls of violet lightning revolving within his pupils, adding a peculiar and mysterious aura to him.\u201cDammit! So it\u2019s just a wasteland that exists within a spatial tear. I fucking thought it\u2019s a minor world that hadn\u2019t been explored. Now I\u2019m doomed! If I\u2019m caught by that unruly little girl I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dThe violet robed handsome young man\u2019s face revealed a trace of an annoyed expression, then he noticed something and his sword shaped eyebrows fiercely knit. His figure vanished on the spot with a whoosh, as if he\u2019d vanished into thin air.\u201cHe\u2019s fled again! This damn bastard!\u201dThe sky shattered with a bang to reveal a deep and gloomy passage, and a young woman with a delicate appearance and a graceful figure walked out in fury. She swept her gaze towards the surroundings and seemed to have not found what she wanted, then she fiercely stomped the ground before turning around and without hesitation, she returned into the passage in space once again.The middle of the 5,000 km domain of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, was precisely the publically acknowledged depths of the Southern Barbaric Forbidden Area. Circles of ripples abruptly appeared in the sky before a cliff waterfall, and a tall figure walked out from within the ripples. It was shockingly the violet robed young man from before.\u201cOh, there are actually so many greater demons\u2026 Hmm, not bad, not bad indeed. Hiding here for some time seems to be a good choice.\u201dAs he spoke, the violet robed young man stroked his chin and looked around his surroundings, then he extended out his slender and white right hand to lightly grab towards the sky, and a large black python that was thick like a bucket suddenly appeared in his originally empty hand.There was a small blood red horn on this large python, its entire body was densely covered with layer upon layer of scales that were like cloud markings, and four golden little claws even grew out beneath its abdomen.\u201cOh, soon to transform into a flood dragon? Unfortunately, you\u2019ve cultivated for over 5,000 years for nothing, and in the end, you can only obediently become the meal in my stomach\u2026\u201d The violet robed young man smiled evilly. He paid no regard to the begging expression emitted from the enormous python\u2019s eyes as he exerted force with his fingers and they were like sharp edges as they deeply sunk into the enormous pythons head.Boom!The head of the enormous python instantly transformed into a bloody rain that covered the sky and showered downwards.The eyes of the violet clothed young man that were like two violet vortexes slightly narrowed, and the corners of his mouth curled into a slight blade-like angle. He raised his head and extended out a scarlet tongue, then he allowed the blood to splash on his body as he freely enjoyed this type of bloody and wild banquet.\u2026Bang!Chen Xi had just stood stably and hadn\u2019t even had the chance to see the scene in his surroundings clearly when a black figure pounced towards him. He didn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest as he struck out with his fist, directly smashing the black figure flying over to the ground 30 over meters away.Roar!The black figure lay prone on the ground and howled in reluctance to leave this world.Only now did Chen Xi see clearly that this black figure was actually a wild beast the size of a calf that had a hideous appearance. Its entire body was jet-black like graphite, its eyes dark red like brass bells, and it emitted a brutal and ferocious aura.Chen Xi gazed at his surroundings, and he only saw that the sky here was suffused with a thick layer of lead gray clouds that vaguely revealed a dark red color. The ground was filled with rocks and sand, and when the piercingly cold wind whistled past, sand and dust would flutter in the air to suffuse out like a mist, causing one to be unable to see where exactly in the distance was the end.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - Netherezim Baleful QiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 38 - Netherezim Baleful QiBang!A sword light that was cold like snow flashed past, and the head of the baleful beast that Chen Xi struck down was instantly penetrated with a thumb-size hole.The baleful beast let out a miserable howl before crashing onto the ground.\u201cThese baleful beasts are all condensed from baleful qi, and one may say that they\u2019re immortal. A baleful beast will only lose its combat ability when its head is shattered and the baleful pearl contained within is removed. Then, it will transform into baleful qi and dissipate.\u201d Du Qingxi walked forward from the side, and she explained as she extracted a pigeon egg sized black colored pearl from the head of the baleful beast\u2019s corpse.\u201cOh, look. This thing is of no use to me, you keep it. You can exchange them for some spirit stones once we go out of here.\u201d Du Qingxi casually tossed the baleful pearl in her hand to Chen Xi.Chen Xi received the baleful pearl and couldn\u2019t help but be stunned. He noticed that Du Qingxi attitude towards him seemed to have changed greatly, and it had an extra trace of faintly discernible care.\u201cLet\u2019s go. We can\u2019t fly within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. Our destination is still extremely far. If we can\u2019t reach there within a month, then we would have wasted this opportunity that was difficult to come by.\u201dDu Qingxi didn\u2019t wait for Chen Xi to carefully appreciate the reason for this care and walked towards the distance.\u201cJinx, follow us well. Be sure not to lag behind.\u201d Duanmu Ze glanced at Chen Xi as if he was gazing at a clown, then laughed in ridicule before leaping forward, and his sleeves moved gracefully as he flashed forward in an elegant manner.\u201cOh, we have to hurry on with our journey.\u201d Song Lin was still in a drowsy state, and his figure fluttered like a drunken monkey, seeming to be slow but he miraculously followed closely behind the group.Chen Xi didn\u2019t dare hesitate and he executed his Heavenly Dragon\u2019s Eight Steps that had attained the advanced-stage. The point of his foot lightly touched the ground, and before the dirt splashed up, his body had already flashed out 30 over meters like a willow seed that rode the air. His movements couldn\u2019t be said to be pleasing to the eye, but they were simple and agile and saved extremely on True Essence and physical strength.The sky of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain was always lead gray in color, combined with the dirt that suffused in the air; when a violent wind whistled past, the entire heaven and earth was covered in a layer of mist that was impossible to remove, and it was extremely easy to get lost while travelling here.However, Du Qingxi had a small and exquisite silver colored compass in her possession and the four of them swiftly moved forward according to the direction the compass pointed at, saving the time for them to identify the direction.Travelling in a hurry was extremely dull and dry, and baleful beasts would scurry out from the dense mist from time to time. Although they were unable to harm Chen Xi\u2019s group of four, they still affected the pace of their journey.For the sake of making the best use of their time, everyone besides Chen Xi had all drawn their weapons.Du Qingxi had a forked-tail dagger that was suffused with a dim-green luster in her hand, and on the upper part of the dagger was a lifelike azure lotus. The lotus petals bloomed gracefully and gloriously. Its name was Unity Azurelotus Dagger, and it was a graded Magic Treasure.The sword in Duanmu Ze\u2019s hand was 0.3m long and two fingers wide; the blade was like an expanse of autumn water. There were seven stars that were suffused with rainbow colored lights carved on the sword, and spots of chilly starlight flickered gracefully, making it seem full of spirit. Its name was Sevenstar Rainbow Sword, and it was similarly a graded Magic Treasure.As for Song Lin, he held an umbrella shaped weapon. The frame of the umbrella was a glossy black color and was inscribed with countless dense runes; the umbrellas surface was instead made up of 1,008 sharp hooks that were connected together, and it was suffused with a ghastly and murderous aura. Its name was Skynet Thousandhook Umbrella and it was undoubtedly a graded Magic Treasure as well.Moreover, for the sake of protecting themselves well, besides the weapons in their hands, the three of them all wore various equipment that flickered with bright lights, such as armor, shoulder guards, bracers, and a belt\u2026 Even the shoes on their feet were of extraordinary quality with profound functions. It caused Chen Xi eyes to be dazzled by all this and he was full of yearning. He had to admit that just the various Magic Treasures in the possession of these disciples from great clans weren\u2019t something that any ordinary person was able to possess.Although because of the Essenceseal pill, the strength of Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three that was fully equipped was maintained at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm, the formidability of their battle strength far surpassed an ordinary cultivator with the same cultivation. At the instant they noticed a baleful beast approaching, one of the three of them would beat the others to attack it, and they were all one hit kills that absolutely didn\u2019t allow a chance of survival.Chen Xi held a sword in his hand, this sword was fully light azure with a sharp edge, and its name was Azurebolt Sword. It was the sword he entrusted to Pei Pei to buy while he was in close door training within the Quiet Room and coupled with that Chaotic Windsplit Sword Technique, it cost him an entire 2,000 plus spirit crystals. If it wasn\u2019t for him killing that two-headed Violet Rhino greater demon and unexpectedly obtaining 3,000 spirit crystals, he would have been unable to afford this Azurebolt Sword that had attained the standard of a high-grade mortal weapon.Comparisons were indeed odious!However, Chen Xi was already content with being able to possess his Azurebolt Sword. After all, his circumstances and resources were utterly incapable of comparing with those disciples from great clans that were born with a golden spoon. Rather than being envious and jealous, it was better to think of how to obtain these things in the future through his own effort. That was the matter that was truly important.All along the way, Chen Xi practically didn\u2019t have the opportunity to fight because of the presence of Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three. He would only run up when the baleful beasts were killed to dig out the baleful pearl within its head. In a short time of not even two hours, he actually collected an entire 300 over baleful pearls which could be considered as an unexpected sum of wealth.Chen Xi thought inwardly.The capital of Darchu Dynasty, Silken City, was an entire 500,000 km away from the southern territory. He would only be able to control a Magic Treasure and fly over when he advanced into the Violet Palace Realm. But even then, it was difficult to travel there without spending 10 to 15 days.\u201cWhy sell them? According to my observation, this tiny pearl contains a tiny bit of an extremely rare Netherezim Baleful Qi. When your cultivation attains the Rebirth Realm, the marvelousness of its effect when used to condense a Rebirth Wheel would absolutely exceed your imagination.\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s voice suddenly sounded out within Chen Xi\u2019s heart, causing his body to freeze for a moment before returning to normal. He\u2019d long since become used to the various unfathomable abilities of this unconventional spirit of the Manor.Nevertheless, this was the first time he was communicating with Ji Yu via his soul after all, and he couldn\u2019t help but ask curiously, \u201cYou\u2019re able to perceive my thoughts?\u201d\u201cNo, but I saw you holding the baleful pearl and thinking hard with a frown. It was easy to guess,\u201d replied Ji Yu.Chen Xi came to a sudden understanding, and he unconsciously heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. The secrets and thoughts of one\u2019s own heart being easily spied on and understood by another was something that anyone would be absolutely unable to tolerate.\u201cRight, you said this baleful pearl contains a tiny bit of Netherezim Baleful Qi?\u201d After putting down the worries in his heart, Chen Xi suddenly realized the meaning of Ji Yu\u2019s words, and his heart couldn\u2019t help but tremble.Various unimaginable baleful qis were contained within the heaven and the earth, and they were divided into three ranks. These ranks were the heaven-rank, earth-rank, and mortal-rank; these ranks were further divided into three grades, namely high-grade, intermediate-grade, and low-grade. In short, there were three ranks and nine grades.The common Soulsmelt Baleful Qi and Icesoul Baleful Qi both belonged to the lowest low-grade mortal-rank baleful qi. Whereas baleful qis that had attained the earth-rank belonged to the ranks of rare baleful qis. Baleful qi that had attained the heaven-rank were rare treasures that could only be encountered by luck and not sought after.Netherezim Baleful Qi was a type of heaven-rank baleful qi, as for which grade within the heaven-rank it pertained to, even Chen Xi didn\u2019t know, clearly due paying very little attention to information in this aspect.But even then, just by the two words, heaven-rank, Chen Xi dared to affirm that so long as he dared say that he had Netherezim Baleful Qi in his possession, it would absolutely attract the coveting of countless great cultivators!The reason for this was that when a cultivator wanted to break through to the Rebirth Realm, the cultivator must use baleful qi to condense a Rebirth Wheel within the Dantian.There were seven temperings in the Rebirth Realm, one Rebirth Wheel per tempering. Moreover, besides sufficient True Essence, when one wanted to condense a Rebirth Wheel, baleful qi was the crux of the process!The formidability of a Rebirth Realm cultivator\u2019s strength was closely related to the rank and grade of the baleful qi used to condense the Rebirth Wheel. The cultivation of a cultivator that used mortal-rank baleful qi to condense his Rebirth Wheel would inherently lose tremendously to a cultivator that used heaven-rank baleful qi to condense his Rebirth Wheel.It was easily imaginable how excited Chen Xi was now when he found out that this tiny baleful pearl actually contained a type of heaven-rank baleful qi.\u201cExactly. However, the Netherezim Baleful Qi within the baleful pearl is extremely scarce. You\u2019ll have to gather over 10,000 baleful pearls, you\u2019ll more or less be able to extract a palm-sized ball of Netherezim Baleful Qi.\u201d Ji Yu sighed and said, \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to take the trouble, I can pass on the extraction technique to you.\u201dAlthough the Rebirth Realm was an extremely distant goal to Chen Xi, being able to gather Netherezim Baleful Qi now was much better than spending the time to gather it in the future, after all.Most importantly, Netherezim Baleful Qi was a heaven-rank baleful qi that could only be encountered by luck and not sought after. How could Chen Xi miss this extremely great opportunity? So, he agreed right away without the slightest hesitation.Ji Yu was forthright, and at the moment before Chen Xi could even react, a piece of concise technique appeared within his mind.The technique\u2019s name was Extraction Arts and it was a technique that specialized in extracting baleful qi. Its concept was extremely ingenious and wasn\u2019t difficult to cultivate.In next to no time, Chen Xi had already mastered this technique, but due to pushing on their journey currently, he wasn\u2019t able to take a baleful pearl and try the technique.Chen Xi wasn\u2019t anxious as he knew that the cultivation of any technique was absolutely not something that could be done in a short amount of time. Just like talisman crafting and culinary arts, unless one cultivated diligently and bitterly, it was absolutely impossible to attain the level of being skilled in it.Because of finding out of the secret of the Netherezim Baleful Qi, Chen Xi gathered the baleful pearls along the way even more diligently. This change instantly attracted contempt from Duanmu Ze, and he even generously directed ridicule and cutting remarks at Chen Xi.Like \u2018a bumpkin that hasn\u2019t seen the world,\u2019 \u2018insatiably greedy and shameless person,\u2019 \u2018jinx that\u2019s greedily gathering wealth like a madman\u2019\u2026 These cutting remarks ceaselessly flew out of Duanmu Ze\u2019s mouth with varying tones. Compared to Chen Xi who was concentrated on gathering baleful pearls, the current Duanmu Ze was akin to a widow that had been lonely for a long time, forever possessing things to nag about.In the end, Du Qingxi was truly unable to stand by and watch any longer, so she turned around and glanced coldly. Only then did Duanmu Ze reluctantly shut his mouth.Song Lin didn\u2019t let the opportunity slip by and muttered, \u201cOh, Little Zeze that doesn\u2019t care about poise is actually quite cute\u2026\u201dDuanmu Ze\u2019s pupils abruptly went wide, his feet staggered and he nearly fell down.Duanmu Ze\u2019s mouth gaped but he didn\u2019t know where to begin talking from because he woefully noticed that before that damnable fellow, Chen Xi, he seemed to have never been his normal self\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 - Bloody MountainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39 - Bloody MountainAfter walking for nearly 12 hours, Chen Xi still had a feeling as if he was walking in mist, and besides the baleful beasts that pounced out one after the other, he never saw a single other thing.There were an entire 10,000 plus people that had entered the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain this time, but up until now, Chen Xi hadn\u2019t seen anyone besides Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin who were by his side.Obviously, everyone was transported to a different location upon entering the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.Du Qingxi suddenly stopped moving, then she looked at the sky before looking at the map in her hand, and she turned around and suggested. \u201cLet\u2019s rest for a while. We\u2019ll be leaving this Dusty Nightmare Area in another 15 minutes and enter Bloody Mountain.\u201d\u201cInnumerable amounts of baleful beast packs wreak havoc within Bloody Mountain. Moreover, when we arrive there, we\u2019ll encounter other cultivators. For the sake of survival and baleful pearls, or perhaps for the sake of that sword immortal\u2019s abode, the true competition and slaughter will be arriving really soon.\u201d Her voice that was chilly like ice had a trace of rare seriousness, and this was extremely rarely seen on Du Qingxi. Thus, it was noticeable how dangerous Bloody Mountain was that it caused even her to feel troublesome.\u201cExactly. Baleful beast leaders accompany the baleful beast packs sometimes, these baleful beast leaders have cultivations equivalent to the initial-stage of the Violet Palace realm and are extremely terrifying. However, these baleful beast leaders would never actively attack people, but so long as someone enrages it, it would absolutely be a disaster to us who have our strengths limited to the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm.\u201d Duanmu Ze had a solemn expression as he pondered for a moment before saying, and he didn\u2019t boast shamelessly and confidently like he usually did.Chen Xi who sat cross-legged as he counted the number of baleful pearls started paying attention when he saw the expression of both of them carrying a trace of seriousness.\u201cActually, I think the most dangerous thing is still the other cultivators that came here with us.\u201d Song Lin rubbed his sleepy eyes as he interrupted.Chen Xi pondered inwardly.Du Qingxi and Duanmu Ze seemed to have become aware of something and both shot their gazes at Song Lin. Both of them knew that in spite of this fellow being slovenly, indolent, and was addicted to sleeping like it was his life; but his heart was like a clear mirror, and any signs of trouble in the surroundings would be unable to escape his notice. Now that he said this, could it be that he\u2019d noticed something?Song Lin spread out his hands and said helplessly, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. In any case, I had a jittery feeling before we entered the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. It was as if a formidable fellow that we don\u2019t know of is concealed amongst those cultivators.\u201dDu Qingxi\u2019s face was already completely serious when she heard Song Lin say this.\u201cQingxi, you don\u2019t have to be too worried. No matter how formidable these concealed fellows are, so long as they\u2019ve entered the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, then their strengths would be restricted to the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm just like us. The three of us joining forces are sufficient to deal with everything.\u201d Duanmu Ze consoled in a light voice.Du Qingxi was instead unable to accept this, and she casually found a place to sit cross-legged before closing her eyes and pondering.Unfamiliar cultivators that came from outside Pine Mist City occupied more than half of a number of people that participated in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials this time. For the sake of seizing even more baleful pearls, or perhaps for the sake of that sword immortal\u2019s abode, these fellows would surely stop at nothing.All of this was within Du Qingxi\u2019s expectations, but when she heard what Song Lin said and recalled that there were still formidable figures concealed amongst these cultivators, how would she dare let her guard down?Song Lin\u2019s cultivation equally matched hers, but the cultivation technique he cultivated was extremely marvelous, and it was able to acutely perceive the dangers that could exist in the surroundings. Moreover, how terrifying would the cultivation of the person be that he\u2019s able to cause Song Lin to feel danger?Du Qingxi lightly sighed in her heart, and her confident heart couldn\u2019t help but slightly sway.\u201cWhat\u2019re you daydreaming for? Get cooking!\u201dDuanmu Ze glared at Chen Xi before turning around and going nearby Du Qingxi before saying in a gentle voice, \u201cQingxi, we\u2019ve traveled for so long, I presume you\u2019re extremely exhausted right? What do you want to eat? Ask that kid to make it for you.\u201dChen Xi had learned how to disregard this Young Master that provoked him for time to time, and he very naturally shot his gaze towards Du Qingxi.Du Qingxi opened her eyes and pondered for a moment before instructing. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a bad idea. Chen Xi, do as you see fit.\u201dThe spirit energy within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain had dried up and was instead filled with baleful qi. If one didn\u2019t have medicinal pills and spirit stones to replenish one\u2019s True Essence, then not to mention killing baleful beasts to gather baleful pearls, even surviving was an extremely difficult thing. The reason she brought Chen Xi along was precisely because Chen Xi was able to cook delicious delicacies that were full of spirit energy.\u201cThen I\u2019ll make some exhaustion relieving dishes, and let you replenish some of your physical strength.\u201d Chen Xi nodded.\u201cI want to eat as well!\u201d Song Lin shouted out loudly. When eating was mentioned, this slovenly fellow that was always sleeping was virtually as if on drugs, and he was full of spirit.\u201cDon\u2019t forget to make a portion for me. If you dare be shifty then I\u2019ll surely teach you a lesson!\u201d Duanmu Ze seemed to have recalled something when he saw Chen Xi take out some ingredients and began preparing to cook, and he warned in a cold voice.\u201cHey, why\u2019re you so fierce to our spirit chef? Isn\u2019t it only not getting to eat some Hundred Treasures Porridge in the morning? Brother Duanmu, think about it, what if he puts a little poison into your bowl? Haha!\u201d Song Lin smiled broadly as he teased.Duanmu Ze was stunned.\u201cOh, he doesn\u2019t have to poison your food. He just has to spit a little bit or toss in some piss or shit\u2026\u201d The extremely slovenly Song Lin seemed to be extremely interested in hardcore things, and the more he said, the more excited he became.The corners of Duanmu Ze\u2019s mouth fiercely twitched, then he looked at the faraway Chen Xi, and he could only grit his teeth as he decided inwardly.Chen Xi wasn\u2019t so senseless nor did he have such hardcore tastes like Song Lin. They were about to enter the fiendish Bloody Mountain, even if he wanted to disgust Duanmu Ze, he would have to decide based on the circumstances.Duanmu Ze was currently in the same group as Chen Xi, after all. Even if they were an eyesore to each other, but under the current circumstance, he had no choice but to temporarily put down this resentment and face the approaching dangers together.Grilled Mandarin Fish, Shallow-fried Croton Fruit, Deep-fried Mandarin Fishballs, Stir-fried Mantis Shrimp with Raw Scallions, Pork Braised in Emerald Mushroom Oil\u2026 In next to no time, plate after plate of lustrous and tempting dishes came fresh out of the wok.A string of music that melodious and pleasant to the ear like gurgling stream sounded out from within a screen that was coiled around by spirit energy. Within the screen that was painted with flowers, birds, insects, and fish; Duanmu Ze, Du Qingxi, and Song Lin sat around a sapphire roundtable. As they gazed at the various delicious delicacies that were served continuously like flowing water and smelled the various tempting fragrances that floated in the air, their moods were instantly elated.Being able to eat such a sumptuous banquet that was filled with spirit energy within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain that was desolate like a wasteland and covered in layers of haze caused by the wind and sand that covered the sky, was undoubtedly something that made one extremely happy.\u201cI never expected that Qingxi would prepare so thoroughly, and even screens, tables, and chairs have been sufficiently prepared. When sitting here, the sounds of wind and sand whistling can\u2019t be heard, the gloomy and hazy scene can\u2019t be seen; the eyes and nose are filled with feasts to the eye and graceful sounds of music. Truly knowing how to enjoy life.\u201d Duanmu Ze held up the small wine cup made from carved jade and drained the cup in one gulp, then he emitted a satisfied sigh.\u201cEnjoying?\u201d Du Qingxi was dazed and a trace of sorrow surged out from deep within her eyes.\u201cEat food, eat food. Why are all of you chatting for? Oh, this Floss Candied Dragon Banana is too tasty\u2026\u201d Song Lin was like the reincarnation of a hungry ghost, his hands got to work and his chopsticks descended like rain drops as he gobbled down his food.Chen Xi pushed the screen open and walked in, then he put down a pot of fresh and fragrant Treasurefruit Soup before turning around and leaving.\u201cYou\u2019re not eating with us?\u201d Du Qingxi raised her head and asked.\u201cI\u2019m roasting some meat, all of you eat first.\u201d Chen Xi replied without turning back. He didn\u2019t want to sit at the same table as Duanmu Ze.\u201cQingxi, he likes to stay outside. Moreover, there\u2019s no reason for a servant like him to eat with us.\u201d Duanmu Ze hurriedly mediated when he saw Du Qingxi still wanting to say something.Du Qingxi said coldly, \u201cHe\u2019s a spirit chef, we have an employment relationship!\u201dDuanmu Ze curled his lips in contempt, then said indifferently. \u201cOh, is that so.\u201d\u2026Chen Xi didn\u2019t have the time to be envious of the luxurious life of Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three, he sat on an area covered in gravel that was extremely far away as he voraciously annihilated a roasted hind leg of a roe deer. After he filled his stomach, Chen Xi dashed towards that area covered in layers of haze in the distance.He wanted to gather baleful pearls!Although he\u2019d already gathered nearly 3,000 baleful pearls all along the way here, this was still far from enough. According to Ji Yu, he would need to extract the Netherezim Baleful Qi from at least 10,000 baleful pearls to be able to condense a Rebirth Wheel.10,000 baleful pearls would also mean that he must kill 10,000 baleful beasts, and this was a number that would absolutely cause someone to feel it was hopeless. But, Chen Xi had only entered the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain this time with great difficulty, how would he be willing to leave without gathering sufficient Netherezim Baleful Qi?However, right when Chen Xi had dashed out for not even 1.5km, a shrill cry suddenly sounded out from within the far away layers of haze.\u201cFlee quickly, a baleful beast pack is coming!\u201d The voice revealed boundless terror, and it wasn\u2019t long before numerous cultivators dashed out of the far away haze in panic. Their hair was in disorder, clothes torn and stained with blood, and they were in an extremely sorry state.Chen Xi stopped moving, and his formidable soul\u2019s Perception Force spread out.\u201cFlee quickly! A baleful beast pack is coming!\u201d Under the waves of shrill cries, those people had already come close, but an expected event suddenly happened.When the burly middle-aged man in the lead was about to pass Chen Xi by, he suddenly twisted his waist and his fingers slightly opened up as his hand stretched out to grab at Chen Xi\u2019s neck!When they saw this, the others changed from their sorry states to have vicious expressions on their faces as they moved to surround Chen Xi.These were not pitiable people that were fleeing in a sorry state after encountered the attack of a baleful beast pack, these were obviously a gang of cunning and crafty bandits!Chen Xi stood still on the spot, and he seemed as if he\u2019d been shocked stiff from the sudden turn of events.A trace of a savage and complacent smile appeared on the blood covered face of the middle-aged man when he saw this scene.At the moment the middle-aged burly man\u2019s eyes met with Chen Xi\u2019s eyes that were calm like ice, he felt an inexplicable horror surge out from his spine to swiftly cover his entire body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - Killing BanditsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40 - Killing BanditsThe middle aged burly man was called Liang Hu, and he was an infamous leader of a gang of bandits in Pine Mist City. His cultivation was only at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm, but relying on his cunning and cautious disposition, he\u2019d always moved about freely until today, and he lived an extremely comfortable life.The key of it was that he\u2019d never once offended a disciple from a famous sect or great clan, and he only robbed and killed those independent cultivators at the bottom of society that didn\u2019t have status or position.Three years ago, Liang Hu had participated in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials, and he knew everything within it like the back of his hand. He knew that at this place where Bloody Mountain and the Dusty Nightmare Area were connected, he would normally be able to obtain extremely generous returns when he used the layers of haze to conceal his group and conduct raids. He entirely didn\u2019t have to waste both physical and mental effort to hunt baleful beasts to obtain baleful pearls.Most importantly, so long as he was slightly careful, Liang Hu completely didn\u2019t have to worry that his identity would be leaked out when he conducted raids here. Even if the disciples of those sects were to die, their sects would mostly think that they\u2019d died under the fangs of baleful beasts and wouldn\u2019t place any suspicions onto him.With such thoughts in his heart, Liang Hu had brought over 10 Congenital Realm subordinates to participate in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials this time for the sake of conducting wanton raids.Reality was indeed like what Liang Hu thought, in a mere few hours, he\u2019d already robbed and killed tens of cultivators that were traveling alone, and obtain a great number of baleful pearls.Nevertheless, Liang Hu wasn\u2019t blinded by his victories, and he still carefully selected cultivators that traveled alone as the target for his raids.However, at this moment, he suddenly realized that those fellows that travel alone aren\u2019t always weak, and a youth that had a young appearance might not always be a fledgling that was at his mercy.Just like\u2026 Chen Xi who was before him.Only an instant had passed since he attacked to the moment he noticed the calm killing intent that Chen Xi\u2019s eyes emitted, however in this instant, Liang Hu instead had a strong feeling of extreme danger. He didn\u2019t dare hesitate and fiercely stomped his right foot on the ground, then used the repulsive force from the stomp to twist his body and swiftly leap towards the side.However, it was already too late.Whoosh!A breathtaking sword light appeared out of thin air and pierced out with an inconceivable speed that was swift like lightning.Liang Hu\u2019s body was still in mid-air when a sword hole suddenly appeared on the right side of his abdomen and passed straight through his back, causing thick blood to suddenly shoot out.\u201cHow\u2026 How could this be possible? I\u2019d already attained the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm eight years ago, how could it be that I\u2019m unable to block even a single strike?\u201d Liang Hu fell onto the ground and lowered his head to gaze at the injury on his right abdomen that blood surged out from, and his face was filled with disbelief.\u201cBoss!\u201d\u201cBoss is injured?\u201d\u201cHow could this be possible!?\u201dLiang Hu\u2019s subordinates were stunned when they saw their Boss\u2019s attack failed and instead was pierced by the sword of their enemy, and only now did they jolt awake from their shock and exclaim out in surprise.Liang Hu was their leader, and a cultivation at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm already stood at the peak ranks within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, but he was instead injured and fell to the ground within a single move. This\u2026this was simply an inconceivable matter!Immediately, within the eyes of these bandits that lived a bloody life at the tip of their blade, that youth that stood there holding a sword seemed to instantly transform from a little fat sheep into a cold-hearted expert, and it caused their hearts to palpitate in fear.Actually, with Chen Xi\u2019s current cultivation, if he were to really battle Liang Hu, he didn\u2019t dare guarantee being able to heavily injure Liang Hu with a single move. The only reason he was able to achieve it so easily this time was a result of his formidable Perception Force.Early on when he heard the shouts of Liang Hu\u2019s group, he\u2019d used his Perception Force to sweep through the surroundings. His Perception Force that was comparable to that of a Violet Palace Realm cultivator was able to clearly search through an area of 50 kilometers, and he\u2019d utterly not found a shadow of a baleful beast pack. How could he possibly fall for Liang Hu\u2019s trap?Whereas Liang Hu was completely unaware of this and only took Chen Xi to be an inexperienced fledgling. Under his carelessness and lowered guard, he was naturally injured within a single move by Chen Xi who\u2019d already gained insight into the matter.Step! Step! Step!Steady and rhythmic footsteps sounded about, and Chen Xi had an icy cold expression as he held his sword in hand and walked forward with a heart filled with surging killing intent.He didn\u2019t have the slightest bit of a favorable impression towards these bandits that raided and killed people. If it wasn\u2019t for his formidable Perception Force that had noticed something was not right, he\u2019d nearly fallen for their trap and lost his life on the spot. At this moment, how could he possibly let these fellows off so easily?Liang Hu forcefully endured the violent pain as he crawled up from the ground and shouted out explosively. \u201cBrothers, attack! No matter how formidable he is, he\u2019s only a single person. Kill him and the baleful pearls in his possession will be ours!\u201d\u201cBoss is right, he\u2019s only a single person, what\u2019re we afraid of?\u201d\u201cRight! This kid might have a large number of baleful pearls in his possession!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe ferociousness of the bandits was successfully aroused, and they all had gazes of insanity as they besieged Chen Xi.Chen Xi\u2019s was emotionless as always. Having cultivated bitterly within the southern barbaric mountain forests every night for the past three months while fighting life and death battles with numerous Congenital Realm greater demons had caused him to already forget how many injuries he\u2019d received, and how much fresh blood he\u2019d sprayed.The live combat experience that Chen Xi tempered through slaughter and bloodshed had caused Chen Xi to enter combat status the instant he decided to get into combat.No hesitation, delay, or spouting any nonsense, all of his concentration was locked onto the slaughter that was approaching, and his mind was calm and filled with killing intent.\u201cDie!\u201dChen Xi\u2019s wrist nimbly revolved as he stepped using the Heavenly Dragon\u2019s Eight Steps, and the Azurebolt sword in his hand transformed into innumerable sword silhouettes that were like a squally shower, and it sprayed down swiftly and fiercely like a hurricane.The bandits noticed in terror that within their field of vision, innumerable sword silhouettes were like a large net made of sharp blades that arrived before them in an instant, causing them to be unable to dodge.Pu! Pu! Pu!In the air, a string of thick blood was like spraying lava as it shot out violently wherever he passed.The diligent and bitter training during these past three months caused Chen Xi\u2019s Chaotic Windsplit Sword Technique to have attained the advanced-stage since a long time ago. In terms of the profundity of his sword technique, it was comparable to that of a Violet Palace Realm cultivator, and it was far from something these useless bandits could compare to.When Chen Xi had assessed his combat strength within the he wrote every day, he\u2019d labeled himself as being invincible under the Violet Palace Realm. Even the spirit of the Manor, Ji Yu, who\u2019d lived for nearly one million years and possessed a hypercritical eye didn\u2019t raise any doubts towards this. Thus it could be seen to what degree Chen Xi\u2019s combat strength had transformed to.Cough\u2026 Cough\u2026The pupils of the six bandits before him abruptly dilated, and their expressions were stiff and savage. A bloody hole was pierced through all their throats, and they emitted a hoarse and horrifying shrill cry before crashing onto the ground.Even until death, they\u2019d never imagined that Chen Xi\u2019s sword technique would actually be so swift, swift to the point they hadn\u2019t even attacked when they fell lifeless on the ground.The weapons held up by the remaining five bandits froze mid-air, and they stared blankly at their companions whose corpses lay scattered on the ground. An inexplicably large fear that felt like two shapeless hands choking their throats surged throughout their bodies, and they actually forgot to breathe!Even though they were bandits, not all of them had cultivations at the Congenital realm. It wasn\u2019t that they\u2019d never encountered a ferocious person that was difficult to handle within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, but they were usually able to obtain the final victory by relying on their numbers. However, at this moment, when they were faced with Chen Xi who had killing intent filled between his brows, only now did they notice that such a wide gap actually existed between two Congenital Realm cultivators!Their fighting spirit fell like an avalanche as they gazed at Chen Xi who was like a devil, and the five bandits all emitted a sharp cry of terror before desiring to flee.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!The Azurebolt Sword was like fluttering mist as the blurred sword light brought along a sharp howl, and it easily pierced through the backs of the five bandits, causing blood to shoot out wherever it passed.During these past three months of carrying out life and death battles with those ferocious and cunning Congenital Realm greater demons had allowed Chen Xi to understand an extremely important principle: Refraining from holding back in the slightest when dealing with enemies and making sure to kill his enemies as swiftly as possible was always the safest method.He didn\u2019t hold back. Within his eyes, these extremely violent and wicked bandits were a group of animals, and their deaths were nothing to be regretted!Liang Hu had long since been muddled by everything that had happened before him, and when he saw Chen Xi holding the Azurebolt Sword that still dripped blood droplets and walked over, his legs shivered before falling to kneel on the ground with a thump, then he emitted an extremely frightened shout. \u201cI\u2019ll hand over all the baleful pearls. Please don\u2019t kill me, Young Hero!\u201dChen Xi remained completely indifferent, and his expression was extremely cold and indifferent.\u201cI\u2019ll fight you with my life!\u201d Liang Hu couldn\u2019t help but laugh grievously when he saw Chen Xi was so resolute. Under the stimulation of fear from his approaching demise, he suddenly leaped up and a pitch-black dagger suddenly appeared within his hand, then he pounced forward before fiercely stabbing his dagger towards Chen Xi\u2019s Dantian.Whoosh!A sword light flew out and Liang Hu\u2019s head separated from his body and flew high up into the air. A pillar of blood that was as thick as a baby\u2019s arm rushed out from his severed neck and splattered all over the ground.Up to this point, Liang Hu\u2019s group of bandits had all been killed on the spot!If someone saw this scene, they would surely be shocked by Chen Xi\u2019s viciousness and decisiveness.\u201cThey actually have over 10,000 baleful pearls. These fellows have most probably robbed and killed quite a number of cultivators here. Truly a heinous crime! They deserved death!\u201dChen Xi found a Hundred Treasure Bag from Liang Hu\u2019s corpse and briefly sized it up. At the same time that he was surprised at the large number of baleful pearls within, he was even more disgusted in his heart of these bandits that were full of sin.\u201cWithin the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, no matter how a person\u2019s cultivation was, their strength would surely be restricted at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm. I presume Su Jiao and Li Huai are the same as well. But the two of them are Violet Palace Realm cultivators after all, and are even core disciples of great clans. They presumably have various formidable trump cards. If I were to encounter these two people, I wonder who would be the victor\u2026?\u201dAfter tossing all the baleful pearls he obtained into his storage ring, Chen Xi silently pondered for a moment before shaking his head, then turned around and left.When he returned to their campsite, Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three just happened to have finished eating. When they saw Chen Xi return, they utterly never imagined that he\u2019d just experienced a bloody battle, and they greeted him before departing.Chen Xi naturally would not speak out about what had happened, and he followed closely behind them. After walking for the time an incense stick to burn, the surrounding scenery abruptly changed.The originally lead gray sky suddenly turned dark red, and an oppressive and irritable aura brought along a burning hot stream of air as it assaulted their faces.There weren\u2019t any layers of haze here anymore, and their field of vision was extremely vast. Chen Xi was able to see the faraway mountains that towered into the sky and the enormous rocks that were of bizarre shapes, sand still fluttering about on the ground that was devoid of life.Terrifying roars vaguely sounded out from far away, and when interlaced together with the dark red sky, it caused one to feel extremely stifled.\u201cWe will be entering Bloody Mountain from now onwards. True danger and slaughter is about to begin. Watch out everyone.\u201d A voice that was chilly as ice echoed out. Du Qingxi gazed at everything in the distance that was like a blood colored world, and her expression was filled with seriousness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - Bloodbath CityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41 - Bloodbath CityBloody Mountain, before a gorge.Ten plus cultivators crowded around them, and the skinny middle aged man in the lead suggested. \u201cFellow Daoists, please wait. There\u2019s an entire pack of over 100 baleful beasts concealed within this Bloodbath Gorge. \u00a0How about we team up to hunt them and share the baleful pearls we obtain?\u201dDu Qingxi didn\u2019t have any intention of stopping as she said coldly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we still have matters to attend to.\u201d\u201cHaha, Miss, don\u2019t refuse so quickly. What matters could be more important than earning money? After all, with our strength, hunting that pack of baleful beasts is nothing difficult. Fellow Daoists, all of you seem heroic and extraordinary. If you join us, you\u2019ll surely be able to obtain considerable returns.\u201d The skinny middle aged man continued to guide them patiently.Pity couldn\u2019t help but arise within Chen Xi\u2019s heart as he gazed at the cultivators that crowded over.Du Qingxi didn\u2019t say anything else; Duanmu Ze who wore white clothes and had a smile on his face walked forward, then beamed as he said, \u201cEveryone, unfortunately, I have to tell all of you that you\u2019ve chosen the wrong target to raid this time.\u201d\u201cBah! What the hell? Comply or die!\u201d The skinny middle aged man\u2019s face went grim, then he sneered as he snapped his fingers. The expression of those cultivators that had crowded over all suddenly went vicious and their eyes emitted a fierce light.\u201cI\u2019ll give all of you one last chance, hand over all your baleful pearls and scram! Right, leave that woman, she\u2019s just nice for us to vent some steam.\u201d The skinny middle aged man let out a strange laugh as he gave the last ultimatum.\u201cYou actually dare insult Qingxi? Truly courting death!\u201d Duanmu Ze\u2019s face went cold when he saw the skinny middle aged man actually coveting Du Qingxi, and a rainbow colored sword appeared out of thin air within his hand.Om!The Sevenstar Rainbow Sword that contained oppressive spirit energy emitted an unparalleled fierce aura, and it lightly vibrated in Duanmu Ze\u2019s hand; it seemed to desperately want to fly out and drink the blood of its enemies.In an instant, the disposition of Duanmu Ze who held a sword changed. The slight smile at the corners of his mouth transformed into a wisp of an icy cold sneer, and he seemed to become an unsheathed sharp sword that leaped forward!\u201cGo! Let\u2019s kill this kid first!\u201d The pupils of the skinny middle aged man constricted when he felt that change in Duanmu Ze\u2019s aura, and he knew he\u2019d encountered a formidable foe. He didn\u2019t dare hesitate and shouted out explosively, then he held his dual sabers in his hands to whip out balls of sword ripples that enveloped right towards Duanmu Ze\u2019s head.\u201cKill!\u201d The other cultivators brandished their weapons as well and crowded over towards Duanmu Ze.When faced with such a situation, Du Qingxi\u2019s expression was calm and Song Lin looked dazed and sleepy. Chen Xi instead gazed at those raiding cultivators with pity.The skinny middle aged man glanced over at them with the corners of his vision, and when he saw Du Qingxi and the others looking on unconcerned, he couldn\u2019t help but be slightly stunned.\u201cAlkaid!\u201d The moment when the skinny middle aged man was briefly dazed, a low chant abruptly sounded within his ears. When he recovered from his shock, he saw 100,000 unparalleled fierce sword lights had enveloped his surroundings and billowing baleful qi assaulted his face.Clang! Clonk! Clink! Crack!A string of dense sounds of metal breaking like popcorn sounded out abruptly, and all the weapons within the hands of the cultivators that had surrounded to besiege Duanmu Ze had snapped at the hilt.All the cultivators that had surrounded him, including the skinny middle aged man, all revealed astonishment, then their entire bodies were filled with boundless coldness and terror. He was at such a young age and possesses a graded Magic Treasure.\u201cDie!\u201d Duanmu Ze swept the group of stunned cultivators in disdain, then his wrist lightly trembled and instantly pierced out ten plus sword lights that flowed out like water and shot out.Pu! Pu! Pu! Pu!A string of blood shot out into the air, the skinny middle aged man and his companions hadn\u2019t even made sense of Duanmu Ze\u2019s identity when they felt pain in their chest and there was already a bloody hole at the location of their hearts, then their pupils dilated before crashing onto the ground.\u201cLearning to rob others with just this little cultivation, truly extremely laughable!\u201d Duanmu Ze shook his head in disdain, then he elegantly turned around and didn\u2019t take another glance at the corpses on the ground and instructed, \u201cYou, clean up the scene.\u201dChen Xi swiftly walked up and started to skillfully gather the baleful pearls in the possession of these cultivators.Since they\u2019d entered Bloody Mountain, they\u2019d encountered the raiding of group after group of cultivators that lacked a discerning eye. These cultivators weaved together various reasons with an objective of none other than to seize the baleful pearls in the possession of others.When faced with such a situation, Duanmu Ze naturally couldn\u2019t stand idly by and watch.Of course, it was mainly for the sake of showing off his graceful bearing and formidable strength in front of Du Qingxi, and all those enemies were taken on by him, utterly not allowing Chen Xi and the others a chance to make a move. He single handedly went into battle, relying on the high-grade martial technique, Big Dipper Sword Scripture, that was passed down within his clan and the graded Magic Treasure, Sevenstar Rainbow Sword, in his possession, to easily wipe out all the enemies and bask in the limelight.As for those people that were extremely formidable, their group of four never encountered a single one and could be considered to be extremely lucky.Young Master Duanmu felt himself to be above gathering wealth from the corpses of his enemies, and he passed the battle clean-up duty to Chen Xi. For the sake of baleful pearls and the Netherezim Baleful Qi within, Chen Xi didn\u2019t have any reason to refuse, and after experiencing it a few times, his technique in extracting wealth from the dead became even more proficient\u2026\u201cThis gorge is named bloodbath, and there\u2019s a simple city behind this gorge that we can rest in. We have to speed up and hurry over there. Otherwise, once night falls, all the baleful beast packs that are concealed in the shadows will move out to wreak havoc upon every inch of these lands. Even if our cultivation was any higher, we would still be drowned in the extremely terrifying sea of baleful beasts.\u201d Du Qingxi looked at the jade slip map in her hand, and when she saw Chen Xi having finished cleaning up the scene, she didn\u2019t delay in the slightest and walked towards the depths of the gorge right away.\u201cThere\u2019s a city here?\u201d Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but ask on the way.\u201cExactly, there\u2019s already been nearly 10,000 years of history since the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain appeared. For the sake of getting through the terrifying night within Bloody Mountain, numerous cultivators gathered together 1,000 years ago to jointly build numerous defensive campsites. After experiencing the renovation, reinforcement, and expansion of cultivators of the later generations, the current cities were formed.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Chen Xi nodded. True Essence would surely be expended when hunting baleful beasts, and the spirit energy within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain was exhausted, not to mention the baleful qi that billowed to the sky. Not only did replenishing True Essence require bringing along spirit stones and medicinal pills, it also required a safe environment and time to absorb the spirit energy within and cultivate. The appearance of a city undoubtedly solved this problem extremely well.The following journey was carried out in silence. Chen Xi\u2019s group of four passed through the gorge that was 500 km long and arrived at a vast plain.On the way here, Chen Xi\u2019s group had encountered a few other cultivators. Before Chen Xi\u2019s group could react to them, they would move far away to avoid Chen Xi\u2019s group as soon as they met, like birds that were startled by the mere twang of a bowstring. Their eyes emitted dense vigilance and alertness.Chen Xi silently thought about the things weighing his mind, but his feet weren\u2019t slow in the slightest. Under the lead of Du Qingxi, they dashed forward for nearly two hours before finally seeing the outline of the city that appeared extremely far away.As she gazed at the city that emitted an ancient and historical charm, Du Qingxi\u2019s footsteps slightly slowed down, and her chilly voice entered into the ears of Chen Xi and the others. \u201cThis is the first city in Bloody Mountain, Bloodbath City. According to my calculations, there are at least 5,000 cultivators that have gathered there this time. These cultivators have come from different places and there are both strong and weak people mixed within. We must be cautious once we enter.\u201dChen Xi lightly nodded. Fights existed wherever people were. Everyone was here for the sake of obtaining baleful pearls, and once a conflict broke out, it would absolutely be a situation where it would not stop until one party died.However, Chen Xi wasn\u2019t afraid of all this. With his current strength, he could safely retreat even when facing a Violet Palace Realm cultivator, not to mention this was the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain that restricted cultivations and the highest cultivations were only at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm.In next to no time, the four of them arrived before Bloodbath City.Unlike the cities in the outside world, although Bloodbath City carried the word \u2018city\u2019 in its name, its size was no different to a village. Solid walls that were nearly 33m high surrounded the city in all directions and there was only a single heavy iron gate in the center that allowed passage in and out of the city.But at this moment, the city gate was completely congested as a dispute seemed to have broken out ahead and it caused the numerous cultivators to stand and watch here.\u201cLi Huai, what do you want to do? Kill us to keep our mouths shut?\u201d An enraged voice sounded out from within the crowd, and Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.Chen Xi walked forward and briefly sized up the scene, and he really did see Li Huai. Moreover, in the space opposite of Li Huai, he even saw three familiar faces \u2014 The Redleaf Institution\u2019s Lu Shaocong, Qu Cheng, and Duan Ying.At this moment, these three people\u2019s faces were filled with rage, but their gazes upon Li Huai were also filled with fear.When Chen Xi met the three of them the first time, they only had cultivations at the perfection-stage of the Postnatal Realm. Merely three months had passed. Even if they\u2019d advanced into the Congenital Realm, they still were absolutely not a match for Li Huai who\u2019d advanced to the Violet Palace Realm.\u201cHmph! Could it be that all of you have forgotten the incident from three months ago? Not only did all of you spoil an important matter of my Li Clan, you even caused my Li Clan to painfully lose a precious treasure. Tell me, would I let all of you off?\u201d Li Huai smiled coldly.A flash of insight abruptly flashed within Chen Xi\u2019s mind, and he finally understood what had happened, then flames of rage arose within his heart.\u201cSince all of you have nothing to say\u2026\u201d At the moment that Chen Xi was pondering, Li Huai suddenly took a step forward, his right hand lightly grasped onto his sword as a sharp killing intent surged out from his body.\u201cThen die!\u201d Accompanied by his voice, Li Huai drew his sword and moved forward. The tip of his sword whistled with a cold gleam as it casually transformed into fine bright lights that covered the sky; it seemed to have transformed into a myriad of green and luxuriant pine needles that cut open the sky as it headed straight towards Lu Shaocong\u2019s group of three.True Essence condensed into sword lights that were as thin as needles, Li Huai\u2019s sword technique had obviously attained the advanced-stage. He only lightly pierced with his sword, but it was grand, majestic, and extremely orderly. It also instantly locked onto all the paths of retreat of Lu Shaocong\u2019s group of three.Lu Shaocong\u2019s group of three obviously never expected that Li Huai would be so vicious and resolute, and would attack arbitrarily. They were instantly caught off guard, they stared blankly at the sword lights that covered the sky as it flew towards them, and they actually forgot to dodge\u2026At the moment between life and death, the same thought arose in unison within the minds of the three.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - Chen Xis RagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42 - Chen Xi\u2019s RageBloodbath City was the first city after entering Bloody Mountain.On this first day that the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain was opened, so long as it was a cultivator that survived through the Dusty Nightmare Area, then they would mostly head towards Bloodbath City.As the only gate to Bloodbath City, there were already a large number of cultivators gathered here.Li Huai choosing to fight here had undoubtedly obstructed the paths of everyone. But at this moment, no one cared, as liking to watch a scene was a common character of humans, and cultivators were no exception. At this moment, they all stood in the distance and watched on with their arms crossed before their chests.The moment Li Huai drew his sword, the grand and majestic imposing manner of his sword drew numerous gazes of surprise, as everyone felt that beneath this sword, those three Redleaf Institution disciples that had obviously been scared stiff would surely die on the spot.Some people had already revealed expression of being unable to bear to watch what was about to happen.Om!Right at this moment, a sound that was like the roar of a dragon abruptly sounded out, and a wisp of a black shadow suddenly leaped into the battle. The sword in the hand of the black figure was like the Milky Way in the nine heavens as it swept out with a loud bang.Clank! Clank! Clank! Clank!A string of dense, ear piercing sounds shook up the surrounding, after which everyone saw the myriad of sword lights that were like raindrops in the sky had all shattered and vanished. Whereas before Lu Shaocong\u2019s group of three, there shockingly stood a tall youth.\u201cFuck! That sure kill sword strike was actually fully blocked. There\u2019s a good show to see now!\u201d\u201cEh, why is it the jinx, Chen Xi? When did he become so formidable?\u201d\u201cFormidable? Jinx is courting death! That Li Huai is the eldest son from the number one great clan of Pine Mist City, the Li Clan. Since he came out of closed door cultivation three months ago, he\u2019d already attained the Violet Palace Realm. I presume he\u2019s consumed something similar to an Essenceseal Pill to enter the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. But even then, he\u2019s still able to annihilate most perfection-stage Congenital Realm cultivators. Tell me, if Jinx isn\u2019t courting death, then what\u2019s he doing?\u201d\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Hearing the discussions from the surroundings, Duanmu Ze frowned as he gazed at Chen Xi, then said with a ridiculing tone, \u201cStupidly charging forward to rescue others. Could it be that he\u2019s thinking that he has our protection, so he can act willfully?\u201dDu Qingxi didn\u2019t say anything as she was bewildered in her heart as well.Song Lin who\u2019d always been in a drowsy state was now in high spirits and his eyes were bright as they gazed at Chen Xi while he spoke out in heartfelt admiration. \u201cThe people of ancient times were compassionate and warm hearted; they were full of virtue and a sense of justice. The food Chen Xi makes is tasty and his heart is extremely good as well, I can be happy throughout my lifetime with such a friend.\u201dDu Qingxi and Duanmu Ze were both stunned when they heard this and they fell into silence.Chen Xi was utterly clueless that his actions had moved Du Qingxi and Duanmu Ze so greatly.He was currently on the alert and combat ready, and he had no time to pay attention to the surroundings.Lu Shaocong\u2019s group of three had already retreated from the battlefield. They felt gratitude from the bottom of their hearts towards Chen Xi who\u2019d saved them once again, and they knew that if they continued to stay within the battlefield at this moment, they would only be a distraction to Chen Xi and were of no benefit to the battle.However, they\u2019d already decided since long ago, that if misfortune were to befall Chen Xi, then even if the three of them had to lay down their lives, they would still put their bodies before Chen Xi, and make sure to win a slight opportunity for Chen Xi to survive. Because Chen Xi was worthy of them doing so!\u201cI was originally still thinking how to capture you and help Miss Su vent her anger. But now, you\u2019ve come over on your own accord. You\u2019ve truly given me a pleasant surprise.\u201dLi Huai\u2019s long hair was scattered on his shoulder and he had a cold and indifferent expression as he gazed at Chen Xi as if gazing at something dead. Then he raised the sword in his hand before slowly pointing it at Chen Xi. \u201cThis sword is called Pine Ripple, and it\u2019s a graded Magic Treasure. Do you dare fight me?\u201dA mere sentence fully expressed the arrogance and conceit of Li Huai, and it brought about cheers from everyone in the surroundings.\u201cFight!\u201dSomeone within the crowd cried out in a loud voice.\u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201dThe fervor of the surrounding crowd was instantly lit ablaze, and they all shouted out loudly with voices that shot into the sky, causing all the far away cultivators to look over. In the end, the other cultivators were unable to suppress the curiosity in their hearts and they all rushed over.\u201cWhy would I not dare?\u201d Chen Xi took a deep breath and said coldly.Along with Chen Xi finishing his words, the surrounding voices instantly vanished and only the whistling of the wind remained. An oppressive and strained atmosphere silent suffused out into the surroundings, everyone was set for a showdown!The two parties that were confronting each other had gazes filled with intense hostility, and this caused everyone to be even more excited. Their gazes shot out in unison towards the two people that were in conflict, and they stared unblinkingly, seeming to be extremely afraid of missing even a slight detail.Li Huai was the eldest son of the Li Clan who possessed extraordinary natural talent and possessed both a good foundation and a good constitution. He\u2019d already advanced to the Violet Palace Realm at a young age and was absolutely one of the leading figures amongst the younger generation of Pine Mist City. Whereas, although everyone unanimously didn\u2019t look favorably on Chen Xi, it was of no importance, as what everyone anticipated the most was actually Li Huai\u2019s show.Most of the people present had a strength that was around the Congenital Realm, and they were undoubtedly filled with curiosity towards the combat ability of a Violet Palace Realm cultivator. They knew that this was a superb opportunity to learn as they would completely have no chance at any other time.\u201cWait.\u201d But, right at the instant the battle was on the verge of breaking out, a tranquil voice sounded out from atop the city wall and it caused a wave of displeasure in the crowd.However, when they raised their heads and glanced over, the displeasure in their hearts instantly vanished.They saw a young woman in black clothes standing on the city wall, her sweet and charming appearance seemed to be covered in a layer of an enchanting and alluring sheen under the dark red sky, and it was shockingly the genius from the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan, Su Jiao.Cang Bin was beside Su Jiao. This young man that was reputed as the Little Sword Devil stood atop the city wall with eyes and brows that contained fiendishness. Although he hadn\u2019t said a word, the domineering and ferocious aura on his body instead caused others to be unable to overlook him.These two people were core disciples from the six great clans of Dragon Lake City. Compared to them, Li Huai wasn\u2019t able to compare with them, regardless of if it was status, identity, or his level of cultivation. At this moment when Su Jiao came forward to interrupt the battle, even though everyone wanted to get angry, they were helpless.However, what Su Jiao said next instead once again lit up the fervor within the hearts of everyone present.\u201cFellow Daoist Li Huai\u2019s strength isn\u2019t bad, but Fellow Daoist Chen Xi\u2019s strength isn\u2019t bad either. If a battle that\u2019s the focus of attention of everyone isn\u2019t set off by a wager, then wouldn\u2019t it be too tasteless?\u201dSu Jiao\u2019s fine eyes held a smile as she glanced fluidly around the crowd, and after she finished speaking, she didn\u2019t ask Chen Xi if he agreed before speaking loudly to the surrounding people. \u201cWhat does everyone think of my suggestion?\u201dIt was normal for her to say that Li Huai\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t bad, but saying Chen Xi\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t bad caused most people to be astonished. Earlier, although Chen Xi successfully saved Lu Shaocong\u2019s group of three from Li Huai, that was obtaining success by seizing the opportunity of Li Huai being unprepared and taking him by surprise. How could he be a match for Li Huai in a true battle?Under these circumstances where the outcome of the battle could be roughly determined, putting in an extra wager was obviously an unnecessary action and it exceeded the expectations of everyone.But when Su Jiao suddenly asked all of them, these fellows that craved for nothing more than to stir up trouble all shouted at the top of their voices. \u201cIt\u2019s good!\u201dDuanmu Ze couldn\u2019t help but be amused. This was no battle, it was virtually like fighting in the ring for the bride. But Du Qingxi who was staring at the battle didn\u2019t feel amused in the slightest.A few simple words from Su Jiao and Chen Xi had fallen into the state of having no way to back down. If he were to shrink back now, then he would surely be crowned with the reputation of being cowardly. Moreover, all the people here would probably not agree to it.Most importantly, practically everyone knew that when Chen Xi was born, he was betrothed to Su Jiao. Although the marriage contract had already been destroyed, when faced with the suggestion of Su Jiao who was his former \u2018fianc\u00e9e\u2019 in name, If Chen Xi were to shrink back, it would undoubtedly be telling everyone \u2014\u201cWhat\u2019s the wager?\u201d Chen Xi stared at Su Jiao who was atop the city wall with an emotionless gaze, and his voice was indifferently like an icy cold machine.\u201cIt\u2019s very simple. If you lose, then hand over the Nether Enlightenment Token, cripple your own cultivation and apologize to me in acknowledgment that the marriage contract between you and me being destroyed was completely your fault.\u201d Right after Chen Xi finished speaking, Su Jiao said in a straightforward manner, seeming as if she\u2019d thought of these conditions since a long time ago.There were several tens of people whose expressions focused when they heard these words, Their gazes all shot at Chen Xi and a wisp of indescribable greed arose within their eyes.Du Qingxi\u2019s beautiful brows frowned, then she looked at Chen Xi, but she instead saw his expression was indifferent as before and she was unable to discern what he thought in his heart.Chen Xi did indeed possess a Nether Enlightenment Token, he\u2019d obtained it from the two-headed Violet Rhino greater demon and he\u2019d not understood its effects all along. But at this moment, his attention wasn\u2019t on this.His entire mind was as if struck by thunder when he heard the last condition that Su Jiao put forward.The scenes of his marriage contract being destroyed surged into his mind \u2014 the disdainful gazes of the Su Clan cultivators, the pained and miserable appearance of his grandfather, the loud laughter of the surrounding people, the shreds of the marriage contract that drifted gracefully through the air\u2026Every word of what Su Jiao said entered ever so clearly into Chen Xi\u2019s ears and fiercely hammered onto his heart. He felt his mind explode with a bang, and a burst of courage surged up from within him. There was anger held within his chest, and this anger accumulated to become stronger and stronger, to the point that the pores in his entire body were filled to the point they grew rapidly and were on the verge of splitting.At this moment, as he gazed at the sweet and charming young girl that stood atop the city wall, Chen Xi had a strong urge to blast her to pieces!But, his expression was unusually calm, calm to the point there wasn\u2019t even a slight ripple or fluctuation, like a pool of stagnant water. His pair of eyes were empty and gray like ash, and not a trace of emotion could be discerned from him.If Chen Hao was here, he would surely understand that his brother was enraged! Completely enraged! Because no one knew how strong the rage and killing intent hidden behind his brother\u2019s pair of empty eyes were!Everyone that had waited silently for a long time finally heard Chen Xi speak.His low and deep voice surged with a force that caused one\u2019s heart to palpitate. \u201cI\u2019ll agree to your conditions, but I similarly have conditions of my own.\u201d\u201cSpeak. Although the marriage contract between the two of us has been destroyed, so long as your conditions don\u2019t go too far, I can agree to all of them.\u201d Su Jiao lightly smiled, and her sweet and charming face was dyed in boundless flirtation, teasing to the point that the minds of everyone became unsettled.\u201cEstablish a vow of the heart under the Dao of the Heavens before everyone. Truthfully answer three questions of mine. If there\u2019s any deception, then face the wrath of the heavens!\u201d Chen Xi spoke word by word and his expression became even calmer, as if he was stating something that was not related to him in the slightest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 - Fight!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43 - Fight!Most of the people present were clearly confused when they heard Chen Xi\u2019s conditions, and those people who had dirty minds guessed.\u201cAudacious! Establish a vow of the heart under the Dao of the Heaven isn\u2019t a trifling matter! How respected is Miss Su\u2019s identity! Could it be that she must answer anything you ask? This condition of yours is going too far!\u201d On the city wall, Cang Bin burst in rage and he shouted out explosively, as an extremely terrifying imposing manner filled the entire scene, seeming as if the most piercingly cold wave of winter air had suddenly arrived.Under this domineering and fierce might, the expressions of everyone present went pale, the legs of some cultivators with comparatively inferior strength went soft and they directly fell on their butts. The entire scene was in chaos.Cang Bin\u2019s eyes stared at Chen Xi with overflowing killing intent.\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t dare?\u201d Chen Xi who was in the eye of the storm still stayed calm as usual, his voice was calm and indifferent, without a shred of emotion.A few words that brought along no emotion instead caused Su Jiao to feel Chen Xi\u2019s incomparably strong ridicule.Su Jiao waved her hand to stop Cang Bin that had nearly gone berserk, and said with an icy cold voice, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll agree to it. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, this condition is bound to not be realized.\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she shot her gaze at Li Huai and said coldly, \u201cBrother Li, I\u2019ll leave this battle to you, you\u2019d better not disappoint me.\u201d\u201cHe will surely lose.\u201d Li Huai smiled confidently and the space between his brows was filled with fierce killing intent. To him, if he were to be victorious in this battle, then he would undoubtedly be able to win over Su Jiao\u2019s heart. So, he\u2019d already decided that even if he had to put his life on the line, he would still fiercely trample upon Chen Xi!\u201cQingxi, how\u2019s Chen Xi\u2019s cultivation?\u201d Within the crowd, Duanmu Ze frowned as he asked. There was no disdain within his words any longer, because what Song Lin said earlier allowed him to have a whole new understanding of Chen Xi.Du Qingxi was stunned then shook her head. \u201cI only know that he merely has a cultivation at the Congenital Realm. As for how is his strength, I do not know clearly.\u201d\u201cCongenital Realm? Then isn\u2019t he utterly finished?\u201d Duanmu Ze himself had a cultivation at the Violet Palace Realm, thus he was naturally extremely familiar with the ability of a Violet Palace Realm cultivator. As far as he was concerned, even if Li Huai\u2019s cultivation was restrained at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm, he was absolutely not someone Chen Xi could go against. The gap between Realms was something that was impossible to make up.\u201cThat may not be so. Chen Xi is no ordinary Congenital Realm cultivator, let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d Song Lin lightly smiled, and his gaze upon Chen Xi had a trace of a strange color.Du Qingxi and Duanmu Ze both glanced at Song Lin in bewilderment, seeming to have never expected that Song Lin would have such a high evaluation of Chen Xi.At this moment, no one present said another word and they all held their breaths. Everyone knew that the meaning of the battle that was about to begin had already become completely different.Chen Xi was expressionless as he silently stood there without moving.If it wasn\u2019t for him speaking earlier, people might even suspect that he wasn\u2019t alive.Chen Xi was doing his best to suppress the flames of rage within his body, yet his mind was surprisingly calm at this moment and this was an extremely strange state. Within his formidable physique that was tempered to the Congenital Realm by the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts, the blood, bones, and even nerves within his entire body seemed to be about to burn as they carried along dense yearning.Yearning to vent the battle intent that caused him to tremble!He could clearly feel that within his sea of consciousness, the energy of his soul seemed as if it had become excited and was raging madly. His brain was like ice that was covered by a ball of flames, and everything including the smallest detail within 50km was completely reflected within his eyes.Du Qingxi abruptly noticed that a wisp of color suddenly lit up within Chen Xi\u2019s empty and indifferent eyes, like a strand of sunlight that had passed through the dense darkness before dawn. Subsequently, it brightened bit by bit and in almost an instant, these bits of light gathered within Chen Xi\u2019s eyes to become a raging sea of flames.Bang!The grievance and hatred that was suppressed within his heart for 10 over year transformed into terrifying battle intent that was released without reservation, and with Chen Xi as the center, a shockingly imposing manner swept out to cover the entire heaven and earth!At this moment, Chen Xi seemed like a treasured sword whose edge had been completely revealed; a treasured sword that stood there ramrod straight and even wanted to pierce a hole through the heavens.The expression of Li Huai who stood facing Chen Xi went serious, he was able to clearly feel the incomparably frenzied battle intent of Chen Xi\u2019s and that fierce imposing manner that was fearless of death!Li Huai firmly grasped the Pine Ripple Sword in his hand as cold lights abruptly appeared within his eyes and the True Essence within his entire body revolved. The air within 10m of his surroundings was instantly thrown into disorder by the terrifyingly imposing manner that surged out from his body.Battle intent billowed and killing intent raged, even the air became incomparably heavy from the confrontation between Chen Xi and Li Huai. The onlookers were shocked in their hearts, and they forcefully held their eyes wide open, fearing they would miss a tiny detail of the battle.Li Huai took the initiative to attack, the tip of his foot lightly tapped the ground. In the next moment, his entire body suddenly appeared in mid-air without the slightest sign, and the Pine Ripple Sword in his hand created a myriad of sword images that swiftly shot straight downwards like a sharp arrow!Hiss!The fierce and swift sword light flashed past and tore open the sky; it emitted an ear piercing and unpleasantly sharp howl that grew louder by the moment and was like a clear cry of a white crane.\u201cPinecloud Thousand Crane Awl!\u201d A surprised exclamation sounded out from within the crowd.Pinecloud Thousand Crane Awl was one of the killer-moves of the intermediate-grade martial technique, Pinecrane Sword Scripture. This move had already transcended basic-stage martial techniques to attain the level of advanced-stage. The moment it was executed, the myriad of sword lights would condense into one, the whistling it emitted as it tore through the sky sounded out like a tide and seemed like the cries of a group of cranes. The speed of this move and the greatness of its might was beyond imagination as well.Normally speaking, only Violet Palace Realm cultivators that were able to fly in the sky were able to master its essence!No one had expected that Li Huai would use such a killer-move right off the bat, and at the same time that they felt shocked, they couldn\u2019t help but start worrying for Chen Xi.Chen Xi didn\u2019t dodge. He raised his head and that pair of eyes of his that was filled with burning battle intent instantly became crystal-clear and reflected the entire battlefield.Chen Xi\u2019s enormous Perception Force was like the countless tentacles of an octopus as it clearly caught all the changes between Li Huai\u2019s sword skill, and in practically an instant he\u2019d observed a trace of a flaw, and his eyes abruptly lit up.Chaotic Windsplit Sword Vortex!Om!The Azurebolt Sword waved about at a shocking frequency as it drew out countless perfectly round sword arcs in the air before finally transforming into a vortex of sword lights.The vortex revolved madly, and it minced the air to emit dense explosive booms from the fine shattering of the air.It was at this moment that Li Huai\u2019s sword strike that was condensed from a myriad of sword lights tore through the sky to arrive before Chen Xi.This sword strike was one of Li Huai\u2019s killer-moves. He was confident that even if it was a cultivator that was similarly at the Violet Palace Realm as him, the cultivator wouldn\u2019t dare take this sword strike of his head on. In his eyes, Chen Xi who didn\u2019t evade was undoubtedly courting death!Crackle! Crackle! Crackle!However, what Li Huai had never imagined was that the sword strike he condensed from a myriad of sword light wasn\u2019t able to move forward once it came into contact with the sword vortex before Chen Xi. Then, he saw the sword vortex before Chen Xi suddenly start revolving madly like a millstone that was set into motion and ceaselessly weakened the impulsive force on his sword. The tip of the sword that was covered in a myriad of sword lights was actually like a candle that melted at a visible speed!Li Huai was shocked inwardly and he hurriedly withdrew his sword and retreated.His offensive had fallen apart and if he still didn\u2019t retreat, then he would only be giving his opponent an opportunity to take advantage of.Bang!However, right at the instant Li Huai withdrew his sword and retreated, the sword vortex before Chen Xi that revolved madly stopped suddenly and exploded with a bang.The airflow within the entire battlefield shattered with a bang and it emitted a wave of oppressive booms. The sword qi that was formed from countless perfectly round sword arcs was like a meteor as it violently shot out, flashing explosively towards Li Huai who was retreating!Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!The Pine Ripple Sword in Li Huai\u2019s hands was utilized by him to form an impenetrable barrier before him that even a splash of water could not pass through, and it barely blocked the swift and fierce sword qi that blotted out the sky and covered the earth as it approached him. Even though he wasn\u2019t injured, his body was affected by the continuous impulsive force of the sword qi and he embarrassingly retreated over 30m away.\u201cHow can this be possible, Li Huai\u2019s Pinecloud Thousand Crane Awl was actually taken head on by this kid!?\u201d\u201cWhen did the Jinx become so formidable? That\u2019s a killer-move that\u2019s at the advanced-stage! Could it be that this kid has always been concealing his strength?\u201d\u201cSplendid! Li Huai originally planned to put a show of force to Chen Xi with a single move. But he never expected that he would instead be forced to retreat for over 30m by Chen Xi. This is truly a great loss of face!\u201d\u2026Within a single move, Chen Xi\u2019s combat strength that was beyond imagination caused everyone present to feel disbelief. The gazes they shot at Chen Xi carried bewilderment, surprise, astonishment, disappointment\u2026 They seemed to have never expected that the fellow who they thought \u00a0would lose without a doubt would actually explode forth with such a ferocious combat strength.\u201cIt seems to be\u2026 The Chaotic Windsplit Sword Technique?\u201d Duanmu Ze was slightly unsure as the move that Chen Xi executed had a form similar to the Chaotic Windsplit Sword Technique, but its style and might had become even better, seeming to already start taking the shape of a high-grade martial technique.\u201cI think it\u2019s similar too.\u201d Du Qingxi recalled the scene from before and felt extremely bewildered as well.The two of them didn\u2019t know that after Chen Xi purchased the Chaotic Windsplit Sword Technique\u2019s jade slip, it was improved by Ji Yu, which was as good as being reborn. The moves had become even more simple and direct, yet its might instead multiplied explosively.\u201cThe Chaotic Windsplit Sword Technique he cultivated is different from the one sold commercially, and it ought to have been personally improved by an expert. Even though the moves are different, its style is even more profound and succinct. It\u2019s extremely extraordinary.\u201dSong Lin had a burning gaze as he exclaimed in surprise. \u201cI wonder who that expert is? This level of ability to transform the normal into extraordinary is probably something only an almighty expert whose comprehension in the Martial Dao has transcended the mundane is able to perform.\u201dDu Qingxi and Duanmu Ze glanced at each other when they heard this, and they both felt it to be beyond belief.\u201cLi Huai\u2019s sword technique has already attained the advanced-stage, yet he was forced into such a sorry state by that trash, Chen Xi. Brother Cang, are you able to perceive the secret behind it?\u201d Atop the city wall, Su Jiao\u2019s expression was like frost. She was inwardly astonished by Chen Xi\u2019s combat strength and felt a trace of rage towards Li Huai\u2019s failure.\u201cLi Huai was careless, the sword technique of that kid has already attained the advanced-stage and isn't inferior to Li Huai in the slightest. Li Huai was forced into such a sorry state because of being caught off-guard.\u201dCang Bin briefly pondered before continuing. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have to worry. Although Li Huai in unable to utilize the advantage of his Violet Palace Realm cultivation within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, his True Essence, Magic Treasures, and his other equipment are absolutely not something that kid is able to go against.\u201dSu Jiao nodded and didn\u2019t say anything further.\u201cLooks like I\u2019ve underestimated you.\u201d Li Huai stabilized himself and coldly stared at Chen Xi who was over 30m away. Being forced to retreat within a single move by trash from an impoverished family caused Li Huai, who was arrogant and conceited, to feel extreme humiliation.At this moment, when he heard the whispers of discussion coming from the surroundings, his expression became even more icy cold and gloomy; flames of rage suddenly surged up into his chest and the imposing manner on his body rose explosively!A sword cry that was like a roar exploded out!Li Huai openly released his killing intent as the True Essence within his entire body surged. \u201cAfter this, I\u2019ll use the sword in my hand to prove how large the gap between us actually is!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 - Broken SwordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44 - Broken SwordWhoosh!As soon as he finished speaking, Li Huai\u2019s figure continuously leaped a few times and transformed into numerous afterimages. That was the visual error caused from speed attaining a certain level.Extremely swift!Li Huai was like a ghost as he moved about cautiously in an erratic manner. Tiny bits of sword lights covered his entire body as they fluctuated unsteadily; they were like numerous sharp arrows that were accumulating force while waiting to be shot.He appeared to be like the wind as his figure was swift like lightning. He was shockingly using the ultimate technique passed down by the ancestors of the Li Clan, the Windflash Illusory Steps!Within the cultivation world, although cultivation techniques of various grades could be purchased on the market, there were still some valuable cultivation techniques that were extremely difficult to purchase by spending spirit stones.Within those great sects and great clans, the various cultivation techniques and ultimate techniques that were passed down from ancient times could only be seen and cultivated by core disciples. Moreover, these great clans and great sects had extremely strict rules. If anyone were to leak out an ultimate technique without authorization, then a light offense would warrant the crippling of the offender's cultivation, whereas a heavy offense would warrant death.The principle was actually extremely simple: towards any clan or sect, the inheritance of cultivation techniques was its foundation and the leaking of cultivation techniques or other inheritances was undoubtedly self-destruction of its foundation.At this moment, the move Li Huai executed was precisely the ultimate technique of his own clan, an extraordinarily valuable high-grade footwork technique that recorded in detail the three stages of basic-stage, advanced-stage, and unity-stage.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Li Huai\u2019s figure was covered in layers of sword lights as he moved using his Windflash Illusory Steps. He was like a hedgehog covered in spikes, and the numerous sword lights that glowed with a cold light shot out violently.Due to his movement technique being too swift and him moving around Chen Xi\u2019s surroundings, these sword lights tore through the sky with extremely crafty and vicious trajectories, seeming to approach Chen Xi from every direction. These sword lights locked onto Chen Xi\u2019s throat, eyes, heart, abdomen, back, and the back of Chen Xi\u2019s head, seeming to have already taken Chen Xi to be a target board.A trace of bright light bloomed with Chen Xi\u2019s indifferent and empty pupils, then his body abruptly leaped out, and at the same time his limbs were like twisting and swaying branches of a willow when blown upon by violent winds, and he charged towards the far away Li Huai with a strange posture.\u201cFaced with an attack of sword lights that cover the heaven and earth, and left no openings. This fellow doesn\u2019t know to defend, but wants to charge forward. Could it be that he has a death wish?\u201d Someone within the crowd couldn\u2019t help but cry out in a sharp voice.However, the person had only just finished speaking when he suddenly noticed that while Chen Xi charged forward, although Chen Xi\u2019s posture was strange and hideous, Chen Xi was always able to precisely dodge the sword lights that had locked onto him. Chen Xi was like a slippery and hideous loach, moving and leaping within the smallest of gaps. Even though his clothes were torn to shreds, his entire body didn\u2019t receive a single injury. He was completely unharmed!\u201cThis is\u2026 Heavenly Dragon\u2019s Eight Steps?\u201d Duanmu Ze asked in shock, and at the moment he spoke, he felt a burst of embarrassment within his heart.Duanmu Ze wouldn\u2019t have lost his composure like this if what Chen Xi executed was a type of rare cultivation technique. After all, there were nearly 100 billion cultivators and over 10 million sects or institutions within the entire territory of Darchu Dynasty. Cultivation techniques were naturally numerous like a river of stars and were uncountable. Even those almighty cultivators weren\u2019t able to recognize all the cultivation techniques in the world.Whereas the reason Duanmu Ze lost his composure was due to the Chaotic Windsplit Sword Technique and Heavenly Dragon\u2019s Eight Steps that Chen Xi had executed. These cultivation methods were all ordinary and could be bought on the market, but after they were executed by Chen Xi, not only did their style and essence completely change, even their might had risen explosively. They seemed to not be inferior to some valuable high-grade martial techniques. Under these circumstance, Duanmu Ze was nearly unable to believe his own eyes, and thus the loss of composure was unavoidable.Du Qingxi was similarly bewildered, but she was able to maintain her composure because she knew that the nearby Song Lin would surely give her a satisfying answer.As expected, after he saw the Heavenly Dragon\u2019s Eight Steps Chen Xi executed that was beyond recognition, Song Lin\u2019s eyes grew even brighter as he muttered in excitement, \u201cThere\u2019s surely an expert with exceedingly high comprehension in the Martial Dao behind this kid. The expert is actually able to improve the Heavenly Dragon\u2019s Eight Steps by one grade, truly too formidable!\u201dRip!The clothes on his body were torn off once again, but Chen Xi\u2019s expression remained unfazed as he executed the advanced-stage Heavenly Dragon\u2019s Eight Steps to the limit, outdoing Li Huai\u2019s Windflash Illusory Steps.Lu Huai was once again shocked inwardly, then he secretly gritted his teeth and the sword lights that shot out violently from his Pine Ripple Sword grew denser, like a dense torrential rain that enveloped the ceaselessly approaching Chen Xi.Bang! Bang! Bang!Chen Xi\u2019s pressure abruptly skyrocketed when faced with the practically insane sword light attacks of Li Huai. When faced with some sword lights that he was unable to dodge, the Azurebolt Sword in his right hand seemed as if it had eyes, and it stabbed, slashed, flicked, chopped, swept\u2026 to precisely crush the sword lights that came close to him.30 steps!20 steps!10 steps!\u2026Everyone present couldn\u2019t help but sweat at every step closer Chen Xi came to Li Huai as the shock in their hearts grew even more intense. Their gazes towards Chen Xi gradually developed a trace of respect and admiration.Still moving towards the attack even when knowing full well that the sword lights ahead were coming down like the rain was indeed extremely idiotic and stupid, because there were too many methods to ward off this move. There was no need to place oneself into such a dangerous situation. However, when this practically idiotic action came closer and closer to the target, that fearless and tenacious imposing manner was something that everyone felt heartfelt admiration towards.\u201cLi Huai is in danger. Do you want me to help out?\u201d Cang Bin frowned and asked.\u201cNo. It isn\u2019t the last moment yet.\u201d Su Jiao bit her lips as she said in a light voice. Although she said this, her gaze when looking at Li Huai revealed dense disappointment, coldness, and indifference.Chen Xi\u2019s posture when dodging the sword lights was extremely hideous, yet his footsteps were extremely firm. He who was besieged by sword lights that covered the sky was like an ascetic monk that walked against a rainstorm to head forward, and his face remained expressionless with eyes that were indifferent without the slightest ripple.Li Huai\u2019s state of mind became even more restless with anxiety as he watched Chen Xi ceaselessly pressing forward. Although victory hadn\u2019t been decided yet, such a situation had already completely exceeded Li Huai\u2019s expectations.A vicious feeling instantly surged in his chest and Li Huai was on the verge of going mad with grievance.However, right at this moment, a feeling of extreme danger surged into his heart and caused a chill to run down his spine. Li Huai suddenly jolted awake from that vicious feeling, but he saw the tip of a sword that had sharp cold lights condensed on it swiftly enlarging within his pupils, and the piercingly cold winds from the sword seemed to carry along an aura of death as it assaulted his face!Li Huai emitted a hysterical and explosive shout within his heart as his figure abruptly flashed in explosive retreat,However, he was still a step too slow.The Azurebolt Sword in Chen Xi\u2019s hand was like a cancerous tumor on the bones, and at the instant that Li Huai retreated, it moved straight to stab towards the center of his chest.Bang!At the instant the tip of the sword hit Li Huai\u2019s chest, it seemed as if to have stabbed on a plate of steel and emitted a clear ringing of metal.Chen Xi was slightly stunned.It was at this moment that Li Huai abruptly swung the Pine Ripple Sword in his hand to fiercely chop down, and the Azurebolt Sword in Chen Xi\u2019s hand was instantly severed in two.However, although Chen Xi\u2019s sword strike hadn\u2019t injured Li Huai, the terrifying impulsive force that had condensed atop the sword directly blasted Li Huai flying over 30m away to fall onto the ground in a sorry state, and Li Huai was barely able to stabilize himself from not dropping flat on the ground,This turn of events practically happened within the blink of an eye.Although the process was short, the breathtaking turn of events still caused waves to rise and fall within the hearts of everyone present and they nearly forgot to breathe.Clang!The broken sword emitted a clear clang when it fell onto the ground, and only now did everyone jolt awake as if awakening from a dream and they let out a long breath, but their expressions were already covered in shock.\u201cSo formidable!\u201d\u201cJin\u2026 No, Chen Xi is actually so formidable. His sword technique and movement technique seem to have surpassed Li Huai. This level of combat strength is simply beyond belief!\u201d\u201cIs he transcending a cultivation Realm to do battle? No, this is the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. At the very most, Li Huai is at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm at this moment. Even then, Chen Xi being able to defeat him truly too beyond belief.\u201d\u2026The crowd went into an uproar as everyone present expressed their feelings at the same time, and their discussions all held Chen Xi in high esteem. Those cultivators that came from Pine Mist City even silently changed the way they addressed Chen Xi.\u201cUnfortunately\u2026 That sword is only a high-grade mortal weapon. If it was a graded Magic Treasure, then even if Li Huai didn\u2019t die, he would still suffer a heavy injury.\u201d Duanmu Ze smacked his lips as he shook his head and sighed.\u201cChen Xi has already surpassed our expectations. I originally only took him to be a spirit chef, but who would have known that he would attain the advanced-stage in both his sword technique and movement technique with a Congenital Realm cultivation? Even within the younger generation of Dragon Lake City, this level of comprehension is considered to be outstanding as well.\u201dDu Qingxi praised with a sigh, then her beautiful brows frowned as she said, \u201cBut if Chen Xi only possesses this sword, then he will be in an unfavorable situation after this\u2026\u201dSong Lin didn\u2019t speak, he wore his fluffy and disheveled hair that was like a birds nest as he stared fixedly at Chen Xi and a trace of anticipation was vaguely revealed within his bright eyes.\u201cYour strength has indeed exceeded my expectations. But if this was the outside world, do you think you\u2019d be able to come close to me?\u201d Li Huai said coldly.It was indeed so. If it was in the outside world, Li Huai was completely capable of relying on the abilities of his Violet Palace Realm cultivation to fly up into the sky. Unless Chen Xi advanced to the Violet Palace Realm as well, otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to touch even the corners of Li Huai\u2019s clothes.\u201cEven if it\u2019s here, you\u2019re still not a match for me, because\u2026 I possess True Essence that\u2019s more abundant than you, and Magic Treasures that are more formidable than yours, whereas you\u2026\u201dLi Huai glanced at the broken sword in Chen Xi\u2019s hand, and his eyes were filled with disdain. \u201cThis sword was probably your only weapon, right? Now that it\u2019s destroyed, how will you execute sword techniques?\u201dThe spectators that were discussing animatedly shut their mouths when they heard this and they fell into silence.Clang!Chen Xi casually tossed away the broken sword, then gazed indifferently at Li Huai who was over 30m away and said slowly, \u201cA pair of fists is enough to kill you!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - AnswerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45 - AnswerLi Huai suddenly felt slightly amused. The battle had already come to this, but that trash before him was actually still so arrogant, seeming to not take him seriously at all!\u201cHey, did you hear it clearly? Chen Xi wants to use a pair of fists to defeat Li Huai?\u201d\u201cEr\u2026 It seems that he did indeed say that.\u201d\u201cThe last struggle before defeat? But I keep having the feeling that Chen Xi isn\u2019t the type of person who likes to boast.\u201d\u2026Everyone present felt speechless when they saw Chen Xi tossing away the broken sword in his hand and wanting to defeat Li Huai with his pair of fists. Regardless of how hard a fist was, would it be able to withstand the might of a Magic Treasure?Unless\u2026.Some people with nimble minds suddenly thought of a possibility, and their eyes rapidly shot at Chen Xi.When resisting Li Huai\u2019s sword light attack earlier, Chen Xi\u2019s clothes had already been torn to pieces and were scattered on the ground and his bare upper body was completely revealed in the air. With a careful observation, one could notice that piece after piece of clearly defined muscles were distributed on his thin and tall body, he was like a chiseled statue with well-defined lines that glowed with a jade-like luster, as if explosive strength was concealed within.His thin and handsome face, formidable physique with muscles that were interconnected, and his cold and determinate expression, these three combined together, it brought about a strong visual impact.Whoosh!Before everyone could wrap their heads around it, Chen Xi vanished on the spot in the next moment. Li Huai only felt something flash before his eyes and a fist that brought along a dazzling light tore through his vision as it suddenly appeared before him.Li Huai\u2019s pupils abruptly dilated. Chen Xi\u2019s fist was like a thunder strike and it tore through the sky and caused circle upon circles of ripples in the air. This was a formidable force that could only be formed from strength being condensed to a terrifying degree!Li Huai didn\u2019t dare delay and he practically instinctively raised his right arm, and at the critical moment, his Pine Ripple sword stabbed towards the fist that was approaching right towards him.Bang!The sword and fist fiercely collided together, the expected scene of blood and flesh spattering didn\u2019t occur, as Chen Xi\u2019s fist was like cast iron and emitted a clanging sound of metal colliding.Step! Step! Step!Li Huai successively took three steps back, and his expression fluctuated between a pale and grim expression.Earlier, Li Huai was forced to retreat for over 30m by Chen Xi\u2019s sword strike; now, he was once again forced to retreat for three steps by Chen Xi\u2019s punch!When they saw this scene, besides containing shock within the gazes staring at Chen Xi, their gazes abruptly became complicated.Li Huai secretly gritted his teeth, then his figure shot out like lightning. The force of his sword was like a great river and it carried along an outrageously fierce aura as it slashed towards Chen Xi.Bang! Bang! Bang!Ear piercing and heavy sounds of clashing continuously echoed out, fist and sword collided with each other and cold lights suffused into the surroundings. The sword lights that splashed out tore open the ground and tore numerous shocking fissures, but they were unable to leave even a trace of a scar on Chen Xi\u2019s formidable physique that was like jade.At this moment, Chen Xi was like a madman, and his two fists were like a surging current that poured down from a precipice. He practically had a violently fierce bearing that seemed to be fearless of death as he willfully attacked, attacked, and attacked!That formidable physique that was comparable to a Magic Treasure, the billowing battle intent that was raging violently and that fist technique that was like a raging storm caused everyone present to be dumbstruck as their minds shook violently.As he gazed at the punches that whistled towards him like a surging wave with no end, Li Huai was aggrieved and enraged the more he fought. When faced with Chen Xi\u2019s endless punches, he was only able to block the blows, and even if he tried to retaliate, his attacks would be taken head on by Chen Xi and smashed right back where they came from.\u201cDammit! Looks like if I don\u2019t resort to my trump card, you\u2019d still think that I\u2019m helpless against you!\u201dA short moment later, after he\u2019d once again blocked Chen Xi\u2019s fist, Li Huai was unable to endure this situation of being in a passive position and taking a beating anymore. His powerful arms spread out with a whoosh, like a red-crowned crane spreading open its wings, and his body became light as a feather and moved along with the wind from Chen Xi\u2019s punch to glide backward.The hearts of everyone shook as they looked towards Li Huai with burning gazes.\u201cIt\u2019s too late!\u201dHowever, right at this moment a cold light streaked like lightning within Chen Xi\u2019s indifferent eyes. Chen Xi\u2019s figure charged forward with a boom, the fluctuations of the muscles within his entire body surged and echoed out with a string of sounds like rolling waves, and his body was like a flying dragon as the distance of tens of steps was actually traversed by him with a single step to directly arrive before Li Huai, utterly not giving Li Huai a slight chance to react.Hiss!Li Huai felt the surrounding air being forcefully squeezed out, then a fist that glowed with a jade-like luster was like a fired cannonball as it brought along a grand and irresistible raging roar as it suddenly and slowly enlarged within his pupils!Cough! Cough!In the eyes of the spectators, Li Huai\u2019s throat seemed to have been choked by a shapeless hand, causing his expression to become dark purple from being suffocated. Li Huai\u2019s chest rose and fell, seeming to be on the verge of exploding open, even breathing actually became extremely difficult for him and he didn\u2019t even have the chance to open his mouth and admit defeat.Kacha!Chen Xi changed his fist into a claw to choke Li Huai\u2019s throat, then Chen Xi held Li Huai up mid-air. Li Huai\u2019s fragile neck bones emitted a wave of minute breaking sounds, causing Li Huai\u2019s already dark purple face to suddenly become warped and vile from pain.As they gazed upon Li Huai who was powerless to struggle within Chen Xi\u2019s hand, everyone present was shocked speechless.A piece of trash that no one looked favorably on since the beginning, a jinx that most people in Pine Mist City ridiculed. Yet at this moment, that very same trash and jinx had brought a string of surprise and shock to everyone. If they didn\u2019t see it with their own two eyes, no one would believe that this artifice that was similar to a counteroffensive was real.\u201cHe\u2026 He actually defeated Li Huai?\u201d Atop the city gate, the smile on Su Jiao\u2019s face had vanished and her eyes were filled with surprise and bewilderment, but even more of her feelings were that of disappointment and rage towards Li Huai.She\u2019d confidently wanted to humiliate Chen Xi before everyone, wanting him to cripple his own cultivation and wanting him to apologize to her\u2026 However, at this moment, as she gazed at Li Huai who was held in Chen Xi\u2019s hand like a sheep waiting to be slaughtered, it was like a resounding slap was fiercely swung onto her face, and she\u2019d lost all face!\u201cImpatient and short tempered with poor combat experience. This Li Huai only has the name of a genius but his strength is actually extremely weak!\u201d Cang Bin shook his head with a face full of disdain and he didn\u2019t sympathize with Li Huai\u2019s situation in the slightest.\u201cDid you see it clearly? That\u2019s the Grand Collapsing Fist at the unity-stage!\u201d Song Lin was instead not as excited as before when he saw Chen Xi obtaining victory, and he once again returned to his lazy appearance.\u201cI think I ought to properly improve my relationship with him. Such a cultivation in the Martial Dao is rare even in Dragon Lake City.\u201d The gaze Duanmu Ze shot at Chen Xi already carried along a trace of admiration.Du Qingxi didn\u2019t say anything, but a trace of an inexplicable smile had appeared on her glittering cherry lips. Obviously, she was extremely happy as well that Chen Xi was able to obtain the final victory.\u201cHe won!\u201d\u201cSenior Chen Xi has won!\u201d\u201cI knew Senior Chen Xi could do it!\u201dLu Shaocong and the others from Redleaf Institution couldn\u2019t help but be excited, and they cheered in unison.Chen Xi paid no attention to the surrounding discussions and cheers. His right hand still tightly held Li Huai\u2019s throat as he carefully took precautions against any accidents. Only now did he raise his eyes to gaze at the city wall and say indifferently, \u201cI won.\u201dExactly! Under the gazes of everyone present, no one was able to deny this fact. Even if Su Jiao\u2019s identity was any more respected, she still would absolutely not dare go against her word at this moment.However, when she heard the indifferent words that came out of Chen Xi\u2019s mouth, Su Jiao still felt a burst of speechlessness and embarrassment. She only recovered to her normal state after a short while and coldly said, \u201cYes, your strength has indeed exceeded my expectations. \u00a0I originally thought that after the annihilation of your clan, a piece of trash like that only knew how to craft talismans would have no chance of holding your head high in your lifetime. I never imagined that you would give me such a \u2018pleasant surprise\u2019 today!\u201dThe words \u2018pleasant surprise\u2019 were spoken in a much heavier tone by her, as if the words were forced out of the cracks between her teeth, and it revealed dense reluctance and threat. Obviously, this \u2018pleasant surprise\u2019 had caused her to be enraged to the limit.Chen Xi didn\u2019t say anything further, and his pair of eyes were still as icy cold and indifferent as before.Since the moment he\u2019d fought Li Huai, he\u2019d already openly offended the Li Clan and the Su Clan, and there was no room for compromise or redemption anymore. Moreover, Chen Hao had already followed Meng Kong to the southern territory, and if everything went as planned, Chen Hao would have already entered Wandering Cloud Sword Sect by now. At this moment, he was all alone and had nothing to worry about anymore. Why would he be afraid of the threatening intent that Su Jiao revealed?Su Jiao felt a burst of rage in her heart from Chen Xi\u2019s silent attitude and said coldly, \u201cQuickly speak your three questions. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll be unable to endure it and kill you!\u201dEveryone present shut their mouths and pricked up their ears when they heard this, even Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three looked at Chen Xi, as they wanted to hear what question Chen Xi would ask.\u201cWas the death of my grandfather incited by your Su Clan?\u201d Chen Xi spoke word for word as if asking this question was incomparably strenuous.Su Jiao sighed inwardly, she\u2019d guessed long ago that Chen Xi would ask this, but she had to answer it truthfully, and the reason was the vow of the heart she\u2019d established under the Dao of the Heavens.Even if it was a cultivator who\u2019d transcended to become a Heavenly Immortal, if the cultivator were to dare go against the vow of the heart that was established under the Dao of the Heavens, they would still encounter the harsh punishment of the Heavens Dao. A light offense would warrant their cultivation being crippled, and a heavy offense would warrant death.Su Jiao naturally didn\u2019t have the courage to challenge the authority of the Heaven\u2019s Dao, she went silent for a moment before replying with an expressionless face. \u201cExactly.\u201dBadum!The hearts of everyone present trembled. As one of the six great clans of Dragon Lake City, there was nothing to be said against the Su Clan for destroying the marriage contract with Chen Xi. But continuously pressing on at Chen Xi and killing his relatives. Isn't that a bit too atrocious and ruthless?Even though Chen Xi had guessed the answer since a long time ago, when he heard Su Jiao admit it herself, it still caused the hatred and rage that was suppressed within his heart for a long time to ceaselessly seethe.\u201cDid your Su Clan promise the Li Clan that so long as they trap me, my young brother, and my grandfather to death within Pine Mist City, and make our family live painfully with disdain and ridicule to the point we kill ourselves, then your Su Clan would agree upon your marriage with Li Huai?\u201d Chen Xi took a deep breath and voiced his second question.This question had always been like a poisonous thorn that pierced his heart. On the day his grandfather was ambushed, Chen Hao had used a Soundsaver Talisman to record the voices of the assailants. If it wasn\u2019t for this, it would be impossible for Chen Xi to place all his suspicion onto the Li Clan and Su Clan.The crowd instantly burst into an uproar!Everyone present almost didn\u2019t believe their ears when they heard this question. If the truth was as Chen Xi said, then wouldn\u2019t the name \u2018Jinx\u2019 be something that the Su Clan and Li Clan joined forces to cook up?\u201cExactly!\u201d Su Jiao\u2019s expression became colder and colder. Personally admitting the things her clan had done under the gazes of everyone caused her to feel incomparably embarrassed.When those cultivators from Pine Mist City recalled the ridicule and mocking that Chen Xi had suffered all these years, they felt a burst of coldness in their hearts. Killing someone was just an order away, but to use such a method to torture someone until death, these methods were truly too despicable!Su Jiao\u2019s expression grew even icier and unsightly as she gazed upon the disdain and surprise on the faces of the surrounding crowd.Hu~Chen Xi was on the verge of being unable to restrain the seething hatred within his heart, he took a deep breath and forcefully restrained this urge to go berserk, then he asked once again, \u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d\u201cThis was the unanimous decision of my Su Clan\u2019s elders. As for the reason, even I don\u2019t know.\u201dSu Jiao forcefully endured the embarrassment within her heart as she finished answering the three questions, then her gaze abruptly descended onto Chen Xi as she said in an icy voice, \u201cI\u2019ve finished answering the three questions. I presume you\u2019re satisfied, right? But I\u2019ll still give you a piece of advice, watch out! Don\u2019t die in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain!\u201dAfter she finished speaking, Su Jiao wasn\u2019t willing to stay here for a moment longer, so she turned around and vanished atop the city wall. Cang Bin followed Su Jiao to leave, and the two of them seemed to have forgotten Li Huai who was in Chen Xi\u2019s hand.\u201cFuck off!\u201d Chen Xi threw Li Huai out as if he was throwing away trash, and Li Huai fell to the ground around 30m away.\u201cYou\u2026 You just wait!\u201d Li Huai was in a sorry state as he crawled up from the floor, then he glanced at Chen Xi with a resentful gaze before rushing into Bloodbath City.Duanmu Ze walked over to Chen Xi and he shook his head and sighed. \u201cSlaving around for someone else, yet came to such an end, truly pitiable and lamentable.\u201dDu Qingxi raised her head to look at this handsome youth before her that caused her to have a completely new opinion of him, and said slowly, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill him?\u201d\u201cKilling him now is letting him off too lightly.\u201dChen Xi withdrew clothes from his storage ring and wore it as he casually answered, but in his heart, he added.\u201cOh, then let\u2019s go into the city and rest first.\u201d Du Qingxi didn\u2019t inquire any further, only raising her head to look at the color of the sky before leading the way to enter the city gates of Bloodbath City.The sky that was like blood gradually dimmed down as the veil of night was about to descend, and within Bloody Mountain, the most dangerous time was about to descend.No one dared stay within Bloody Mountain during the night, and the cultivators outside the city gate all quickened their steps to crowd into Bloodbath City.Crank! Crank! Crank!When the veil of night covered the sky and the earth as it approached from the horizon, the thick and solid metal gate of Bloodbath City closed with a bang. From this moment onwards, until daybreak, this city would not open its doors again.Howl! Howl! Howl!Far away, numerous sad and shrill howls echoed out within the vast heaven and earth, seeming to be extremely terrifying under the veil of night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tens of thousands of people could be accommodated here.Presently, there were no more than 10,000 cultivators within the entire Bloodbath City; coupled with these houses all being unowned, everyone was able to choose a house to stay in.However, reality wasn\u2019t so simple. Although they were able to avoid the boundless baleful beast packs outside the city by hiding in Bloodbath City, the fighting between cultivators was instead unavoidable.Nothing could be done about it, as the value of baleful pearls were too high and a man\u2019s wealth was his own ruin. Within this Bloody Mountain that was cut off from the outside world, anything could happen.So, for the sake of their own safety, most people choose to gather together nearby the houses of some experts. On one hand, when a fight broke out, more people would equal being easier to be noticed, and it would be even better if an acquaintance were to come to their help; on the other hand, no one dared to guarantee that someone wouldn\u2019t take advantage of the fight to gain the final reward by lying in wait for the dust to settle.All along the way after entering Bloodbath City, Chen Xi\u2019s group had seen many such scenes and they became accustomed to it.The Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials were different this time, and a cultivator that was able to be publically acknowledged as an expert was surely a Violet Palace Realm cultivator without a doubt. Although their cultivations were restricted to the Congenital Realm, comparatively speaking, this level of cultivation was undoubtedly already in the top ranks.As they walked past a house with over 100 cultivators gathered around it, Du Qingxi explained to Chen Xi in a light voice, \u201cLook, there are four Violet Palace Realm cultivators here and they ought to be from the southern territory\u2019s Phoenixcloud Sect. They all have formidable auras, and their strengths are only stronger than Li Huai.\u201dChen Xi glanced over, he saw that before the center stone house were four cultivators in luxurious clothing that had stopped to chat. A stalwart middle aged man, a gaunt old man, a young man and a young woman. They all wore crimson-purple robes with exquisite patterns of a fire phoenix dancing in the air while surrounded by clouds.\u201cThey\u2019ve come for the sword immortal\u2019s abode as well?\u201d Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. Only at this moment did he understand that besides Li Huai and Su Jiao\u2019s group, there were actually so many Violet Palace Realm cultivators that had come here, and it fully showed how great of an attractive force the sword immortal\u2019s abode possessed.\u201cOf course, but the Phoenixcloud Sect is nothing to be feared. Compared to the Dragon Lake City\u2019s eight great sects, three great institutions, and our six great clans, the Phoenixcloud Sect is only a small power.\u201dDuanmu Ze spoke confidently with words that revealed a dense feeling of superiority. The arrogant nature this young master gained through birth was extremely difficult to change.The faraway group of Phoenixcloud Sect cultivators instantly stopped their chat and gazed over at Chen Xi\u2019s group with gloomy expressions. However, they seemed to recognize the identity of Duanmu Ze and the others, and although they were enraged, they didn\u2019t have any intention of starting a fight.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry on.\u201d Du Qingxi glared at Duanmu Ze then turned around to walk towards the center of the city.At the center of Bloodbath City stood five stone towers that shot straight into the sky. Compared to the surrounding low rise houses, they were like giants amongst dwarves, seeming to be unusually conspicuous.What caused Chen Xi to be surprised was that all five towers emitted numerous overbearing auras from within. All these auras weren\u2019t inferior to Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin; some even surpassed them!At this moment, 3,000 plus cultivators were gathered nearby the stone tower, and all that could be seen was a dark and dense mass of people. Thus, the formidable aura of the cultivators that resided within the five towers could be seen from this, and they\u2019d surely obtained the acknowledgment from everyone present. Otherwise, it would absolutely be unlikely to form such an explosive scene here.Chen Xi\u2019s group went around the city before casually finding an enormous stone house that was near the center of the city. Although its conditions were shabby, it had an extremely large space and was more than sufficient to accommodate the four of them.After they sat within the house and rested for a short moment, Du Qingxi instructed. \u201cEveryone, although we don\u2019t have to worry about being harassed by baleful beast packs tonight, we still have to be slightly cautious. Especially Chen Xi, you\u2019ve utterly offended Su Jiao today and it is best if you don\u2019t stray too far from us.\u201dChen Xi was in the process of cooking and he nodded when he heard this.Although he\u2019d defeated Li Huai in the battle today, his physical strength and True Essence were greatly depleted. If he didn\u2019t recover to his optimum condition, then he wouldn\u2019t dare make a move arbitrarily. With Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three here, at least he would be slightly safe.Duanmu Ze sat over and looked at Chen Xi as he asked, \u201cRight, how did you come to possess a Nether Enlightenment Token?\u201d\u201cI obtained it from a Violet Rhino greater demon\u2026\u201d Chen Xi explained in detail about how he\u2019d encountered Manager Wu, how he\u2019d rescued those pitiable people that were taken to be \u2018tributes,\u2019 up to the point he killed the Violet Rhino greater demon in the end.If it was before, Chen Xi wouldn\u2019t say so much to Duanmu Ze at all, but all the way here, Duanmu Ze had repeatedly shown goodwill to him, and the way Duanmu Ze spoke now didn\u2019t contain that trace of disdain and contempt from someone of a higher position. Besides feeling surprised from this, he couldn\u2019t help but feel proud. Being able to make an arrogant and conceited young master of noble birth like Duanmu Ze lower his head and show goodwill was indeed something that caused Chen Xi to feel happy. Chen Xi understood the reason behind this, as it was none other than because he\u2019d defeated Li Huai earlier and directly proved his strength.When all was said and done, formidable strength was the guarantee to change everything!\u201cNo wonder the Li Clan took the so-called \u2018tributes\u2019 to befriend the Violet Rhino greater demon, it was surely for the sake of this Nether Enlightenment Token.\u201d Duanmu Ze came to a sudden understanding, then he burst into laughter. \u201cIt just so happened that this Nether Enlightenment Token was unexpectedly obtained by you. The Li Clan can be considered to have drawn water with a sieve and wasted their time for nothing.\u201d\u201cCould it be that there\u2019s something marvelous about the Nether Enlightenment Token?\u201d Chen Xi asked.This time it was instead Du Qingxi who replied. She glanced at Chen Xi with a slightly astonished expression, then explained. \u201cI presume you know now that the numerous Violet Palace Realm cultivators that have entered the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain this time have a different objective than the objective of hunting baleful pearls like the others, and their objective is the sword immortal\u2019s abode. The Nether Enlightenment Token is the key to opening the sword immortal\u2019s abode, and without it, regardless of how formidable your cultivation is, you wouldn\u2019t be able to take a single step closer to the sword immortal\u2019s abode.\u201d\u201cThe sword immortal\u2019s abode really exists?\u201d Chen Xi asked in surprise. He\u2019d always taken the so-called sword immortal\u2019s abode as a rumor that was extremely vague. At this moment, when he heard that Nether Enlightenment Token in his possession was actually the key to open the sword immortal\u2019s abode, he couldn\u2019t help but feel excited in his heart.An existence that was able to be called an \u2018immortal\u2019 would have a cultivation that had at least overcome the heavenly tribulation to attain the level of Earthly Immortal, and if even higher, it would be to have overcome the nine levels of heavenly tribulation to ascend to become a Heavenly Immortal!But regardless of if it was an Earthly Immortal or a Heavenly Immortal, they were both terrifying existences that Chen Xi could only look up to now. How could the abode left behind by an immortal not cause Chen Xi\u2019s heart to be moved?\u201cIt surely exists. One month from now, a Tri-Factor Teleportation Formation will appear at the end of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, and we can be sent to the sword immortal\u2019s abode through it.\u201dDu Qingxi replied in an extremely firm manner, then she turned the direction of the conversation and said, \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to be worried, there are more Nether Enlightenment Tokens besides the one in your possession. Those Violet Palace Realm cultivators that have come to the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain all more or less possess a Nether Enlightenment Token. Moreover, one token is able to allow three cultivators to enter the sword immortal\u2019s abode at the same time. Coupled with the three of us being here, so long as you aren\u2019t a perverse person, then no one would dare come seize your Nether Enlightenment Token.\u201dChen Xi secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He was indeed worried about this earlier. But now that he was seen through by Du Qingxi, he was instead slightly embarrassed and he diverted the topic of conversation and asked, \u201cThe sword immortal\u2019s abode is so valuable, but why have only Violet Palace Realm cultivators entered here? Aren\u2019t those great cultivators at the Golden Hall Realm and Golden Core Realm tempted?\u201d\u201cThey are tempted, but helpless. This space the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain resides in is unable to withstand the strength of a cultivator above the Violet Palace Realm. Even if they use Essenceseal Pills to lower their cultivation to the Congenital Realm, so long as they attack, the level of the Martial Dao they utilize would surely destroy the laws that operate this space. In the end, they would destroy this space.\u201d Du Qingxi replied in an extremely detailed manner, and her chilly and musical voice was extremely pleasant to the ear.An explanation like this confirmed everything Chen Xi had seen, but he still had a question. \u201cSince a sword immortal\u2019s abode exists within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, then why hasn\u2019t it been discovered in the previous years and has only appeared during the current trials?\u201dAccording to Chen Xi\u2019s knowledge, the history of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain could even be traced back to over 10,000 years ago, yet during this extremely long time, it was rather strange that there weren\u2019t any rumors of a sword immortal\u2019s abode.\u201cBecause this sword immortal\u2019s abode only appears once every 10,000 years, and this year just happens to be the 10,000th year!\u201d Du Qingxi slowly replied.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but gasp, the time for this sword immortal\u2019s abode to be inherited was truly too long, and was simply beyond belief!After eating the dishes Chen Xi had cooked, Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three started to meditate and rest, whereas Chen Xi instead sat at the side as he silently thought about everything he\u2019d seen today.\u201cNether Enlightenment Token\u2026 Sword immortal\u2019s abode\u2026 I never imagined I\u2019d have the qualification to enter it. But if I want to obtain benefits from there, I\u2019ll surely get into conflict with those Violet Palace Realm fellows. Looks like during this month\u2019s time, I have to advance my cultivation properly!\u201d Chen Xi pondered for a long time, then he dismissed it as he withdrew a few spirit crystals from his storage ring before starting to meditate in cultivation.Swoosh!Surging pure True Essence poured into the meridians around his body, then circulated 18 revolutions before transforming into tiny streams that poured into his Dantian.Traveling an entire day and fighting a difficult battle with Li Huai caused Chen Xi\u2019s body and mind to already be exhausted to the limit. At this moment, at the instant he started cultivating, he felt his entire body became warm and comfortable like he was soaking in a spring, and his physical strength and mental strength were both recovering at a shocking pace.Kacha! Kacha!Two spirit crystals transformed into powder. Although the True Essence within his Dantian was already saturated, yet Chen Xi had an unsatisfied feeling. He pondered for a moment, then once again took out another two spirit crystals.In the past, Chen Xi only obtained a few tens of spirit stones from crafting talismans every day, but he had to bring home the bacon and help Chen Hao pay for his tuition fees, so taking even a single spirit stone to cultivate was something he felt was extravagant. He\u2019d frequently have to worry about the spirit energy needed to cultivate, thus it was impossible for his cultivation to advance substantially.However, it was different now. During the time he trained in the culinary arts at Clear Stream Restaurant, not only did he earn a large number of spirit stones, he also ate dishes that were abundant in spirit energy on a daily basis and his cultivation improved along with this improvement in his situation. He\u2019d also obtained 3,000 spirit crystals from the Violet Rhino greater demon, and besides the spirit stones used to purchase martial techniques and the Azurebolt Sword, nearly 400 spirit crystals still remained. Thus, he entirely didn\u2019t need to worry about the problems that came with cultivating anymore.Kacha! Kacha!Spirit crystal after spirit crystal shattered into powder. If Chen Xi was aware, he would surely feel pained by this, but he didn\u2019t have the time to think about it now as he vaguely had a feeling that his qi refinement cultivation was about to break through and advance to the 9th level of the Congenital Realm!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 - Crimsonflame Mountain RangePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 47 - Crimsonflame Mountain RangeHu!Chen Xi awoke from his meditation and let out a small breath of air. A strand of white smoke surged out like a flood dragon and stretched longer as his breath continued.\u201cI\u2019ve broken through. After a night of bitter cultivation, I\u2019ve already attained the 9th level of the Congenital Realm and I\u2019m only a step away from the Violet Palace Realm!\u201dChen Xi stood up and exercised his limbs. As he felt the copious amounts of strength that circulated throughout his body, he thought inwardly.However, Chen Xi also understood that he was able to slightly challenge a Violet Palace Realm cultivator due to the strength of Violet Palace Realm cultivators being restrained within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. If they were to get rid of this restraint, then the outcome of the battle was impossible to predict when facing a Violet Palace Realm cultivator\u2019s true strength.The sky had already turned bright and once again returned to that dark red colored state. Chen Xi saw Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three were already fully equipped and ready when he walked out of the stone house.\u201cYour cultivation has advanced?\u201d Du Qingxi couldn\u2019t help but speak in surprise when she saw Chen Xi who had a glowing look hidden between his brows.\u201cLooks like the battle yesterday was a pretty great help to you.\u201d A trace of surprise flashed within Duanmu Ze\u2019s eyes as well.\u201cOh, I think it\u2019s within reason.\u201d Song Lin glanced at Chen Xi with a profound gaze that contained a meaning that was difficult to figure out.Chen Xi didn\u2019t know that during the battle with Li Huai yesterday, no matter whether it was the advanced-stage sword technique and movement technique or the unity-stage Grand Collapsing Fist he\u2019d executed, they all caused Song Lin to firmly believe that there was surely an expert guiding Chen Xi.At the first light of dawn, most of the cultivators that stayed within Bloodbath City had left to start hunting baleful beasts. Only a few people were like Chen Xi\u2019s group, moving along in a fixed group to head deeper into Bloody Mountain, or in other words, towards the direction of the end of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.When they left Bloodbath City, Chen Xi finally saw that 30 plus cultivators that emitted formidable auras were heading out of the city. According to Du Qingxi, these cultivators were all at the Violet Palace Realm. They not only came from the Dragon Lake City\u2019s eight great sects, three great institutions, and six great clans, there were still some other Violet Palace Realm experts that came from other cities in the southern territory. The experts here could be considered to be as numerous as the clouds.Su Jiao and Cang Bin were within the group as well and beside the two of them were a few extremely conspicuous young men and young women with formidable auras and indifferent gazes.Before Chen Xi could even react from his shock, a sound of hearty laughter echoed out and a few young men and girls that were in high spirits and wore different clothes walked over from the far away group of people.\u201cBrother Duanmu, Brother Song, Miss Du, you\u2019ve all come as well.\u201d The black clothed young man in the lead smiled happily.After a brief exchange, Chen Xi found out that this black clothed young man was called Chai Letian, and was from one of the eight great sects of Dragon Lake City, Starnet Palace. This person was tall and handsome, with a scar on his left cheek; however, not only was it not hideous, it instead added a masculine and rough disposition to him.The three men and one woman beside Chai Letian were instead from the three great institutions of Dragon Lake City, and their status wasn\u2019t inferior to Chai Letian in the slightest. They were respectively Yu Haobai of Myriadcloud Institution, Du Quan and Du Kui of Windsoar Institution, and Murong Wei of Azurewood Institution.Yu Haobai was a handsome youth that was rather delicate, being both refined and outstanding.Du Quan and Du Kui were a pair of twins, both of them tall and stalwart with extremely stiff and reserved dispositions.Murong Wei was the only female amongst them. She had a beautiful and gentle disposition, like a valley orchid that was delicate and attractive, causing one to be unable to help but want to protect her.These five people had obviously achieved some sort of understanding and they all followed the lead of Chai Letian.Chai Letian seemed to have a good relationship with Du Qingxi, and when faced with Chai Letian\u2019s small talk, Du Qingxi who had a disposition that was chilly like snow couldn\u2019t help but reveal a trace of a rare smile.Chen Xi noticed that the slight smile that hung on the corners of Duanmu Ze\u2019s mouth vanished when he saw Chai Letian and Du Qingxi happily chatting, and Duanmu Ze\u2019s eyes vaguely revealed a trace of vigilance.\u201cOh, Little Zeze is actually really pitiable. Chasing after Su Jiao, yet there\u2019s a formidable rival like Cang Bin; chasing after Du Qingxi, yet Chai Letian has appeared again. Truly a helpless situation.\u201dA strand of fine voice transmission drilled into his ears. Chen Xi glanced over to see the indolent and slovenly Song Lin had suddenly appeared to stand by his side. He still had a drowsy look on his face, as if there was never a moment that he was wide awake.\u201cWhat do these people want to do?\u201d Chen Xi sent a voice transmission as well.\u201cForm an alliance, of course. Actually, if you were to carefully observe, you would be able to notice that even though Chai Letian\u2019s group of five are from different powers of Dragon Lake City compared to Su Jiao, but they are from two completely different camps\u2026\u201dAlong with Song Lin\u2019s explanation, Chen Xi finally understood what was going on.The so-called eight great sects, three great institutions, and six great clans of Dragon Lake City had extremely complicated relationships amongst each other and were divided into two camps.Chai Letian represented the Starnet Palace, Yu Haobai and the others represented the three great institutions and Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin represented the Du Clan, Duan Clan, and Song Clan that all belonged to the same camp.The powers that Su Jiao, Cang Bin, and the few young men and women represented all belonged to the other camp.This time, both camps had members who\u2019d entered the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, and for the sake of protecting their members from the other camp, moving in groups was undoubtedly the best choice.\u201cActually, the relationship between these powers are still complicated. They are all colossi that have been inherited for nearly 10,000 years, after all. There are contentions and communications between them, and just thinking about their relationship would cause one\u2019s scalp to go numb from the complicated nature of their relationships.\u201dSong Lin yawned and said weakly, \u201cBut you only have to remember that Su Jiao and those people are our enemies.\u201dChen Xi was speechless, unknowingly, he\u2019d actually been divided into a camp and he wondered if this was a good thing or a bad thing.Chai Letian suddenly turned around and smiled as he gazed at Chen Xi and said, \u201cCould it be that this Fellow Daoist is the Chen Xi that defeated Li Huai yesterday?\u201dDu Qingxi nodded. \u201cExactly.\u201d\u201cNot bad, not bad.\u201d Chai Letian laughed heartily, yet he turned around and continued chatting with Du Qingxi. From start to finish, he didn\u2019t give Chen Xi a chance to talk.Obviously, Chen Xi was only a dispensable existence in Chai Letian\u2019s heart, and it was enough to just greet Chen Xi and was not worth any further attention.Chen Xi didn\u2019t think anything of this, but Duanmu Ze was instead displeased and said with voice transmission, \u201cYou\u2019re able to stomach being disregarded by someone?\u201d\u201cIt seems\u2026 to not be so serious, right?\u201d Chen Xi said in surprise.Duanmu Ze said with utter detest when he saw Chen Xi remaining completely indifferent, \u201cWhen a man lives in this world, bearing and honor are ranked first. If a man has no honor? What difference would living be to death? As the old saying goes, men rest on their face just as trees rest on their bark\u2026\u201dChen Xi was able to endure being disregarded, but he was truly unable to endure Duanmu Ze\u2019s chatter and he interrupted. \u201cYou have enmity with Chai Letian?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely irreconcilable!\u201d Duanmu Ze replied with rage.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we join forces and kill him?\u201dDuanmu Ze\u2019s face froze and he suddenly jolted awake from that inexplicable manic state, then his expression fluctuated between gloominess and indecision before finally saying in dejection, \u201cThat won\u2019t do. If I did this then Du Qingxi will look down on me forever.\u201dAs he spoke, he patted Chen Xi on the shoulder. \u201cBrother, thank you! When are you coming to Dragon Lake City? We brothers must surely have a good drink.\u201dChen Xi was flabbergasted and he suddenly recalled what Song Lin had said earlier. Duanmu Ze was indeed helpless when faced with this rival in love, Chai Letian.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d In the distance, Su Jiao waved her hand, then led the group of people by her side to flash towards the distance.Chen Xi suddenly noticed that Li Huai was following behind Su Jiao\u2019s group. That fellow seemed to have been hiding within the crowd earlier. Now he\u2019d turned around to look in this direction, and when he saw Chen Xi\u2019s gaze, his expression instantly went extremely gloomy.\u201cLet\u2019s go too.\u201d It was Chai Letian who spoke, and looking at Du Qingxi\u2019s expression, it was obvious that she\u2019d tacitly approved of his status as the leader.\u201cHmph! I won\u2019t listen to the orders of anyone besides Qingxi. How about you, Chen Xi?\u201d Duanmu Ze asked with a voice transmission.\u201cMe?\u201d Chen Xi was stunned, then replied. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dDuanmu Ze patted Chen Xi on the shoulder right away, then said, \u201cAlright! We\u2019ll act together from now on, as for Chai Letian\u2026 Bah! Isn\u2019t it just because he has an ancestor at the Nether Transformation Realm? If it wasn\u2019t for this, he wouldn\u2019t even have a chance to lead the group.\u201dChen Xi rubbed his nose in helplessness towards Duanmu Ze\u2019s sudden actions that seemed as if they were old friends, but he wasn\u2019t opposed to it either.\u2026Crimsonflame Mountain Range was extremely vast, with numerous perilous peaks that seemed like sharp swords that stood there holding up the sky and towering into the clouds. Numerous low and violent beast roars could be vaguely heard sounding out in the distance.Crimsonflame Mountain Range was situated 5,000 km from Bloodbath City and stood on a vast and sandy wasteland. It was a place that must be passed in order to head to the end of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.Not only was the number of baleful beasts here enormous, there were even numerous baleful beast leaders roaming about the depths of Crimsonflame Mountain Range. Within the innumerable years of the past, the disciples that participated in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials were all warned by their seniors that they must absolutely not get close to Crimsonflame Mountain Range, so it became just like a dangerous forbidden area.If it was an ordinary trial, there would absolutely be no one that would enter here, but today was obviously not an ordinary time. Numerous figures suddenly appeared at the foot of the mountain, then they instructed in a loud voice before leaping up successively as they made their way into the depths of the mountain range.Their speed could be said to be swift, but they still encountered wave after wave of baleful beast attacks. These baleful beasts came from all around the Crimsonflame Mountain Range with a fierce and savage imposing manner, seeming to want to protect their own territory as they fearlessly charged towards these cultivators.Numerous shrill cries and howls rose and fell, covering Crimsonflame Mountain Range with a terrifying atmosphere that caused one\u2019s heart to shake.That group of people quickly vanished deep within the mountain range.\u201cThis is Crimsonflame Mountain Range?\u201dNot long after, Chen Xi\u2019s group appeared at the foot of the mountain as well. As they raised their eyes to gaze at this incomparably enormous mountain range, the expression of everyone present was extremely serious.\u201cThis is the last barrier to head to the end of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. Baleful beasts wreak havoc within and are unavoidable. We can only forcefully charge through.\u201dChai Letian frowned and said, \u201cWe have to hasten our pace, Su Jiao\u2019s group have already gone before us. Moreover, only three days remain to the end of the one month period. We must make it there before that.\u201dWhoosh!As soon as he finished, Chai Letian was the first to leap out to head deep into the mountain range.When the others saw this, they all hurried to follow him. Du Qingxi was just intending to go as well when she suddenly noticed Chen Xi staring blankly on the spot and remaining unmoved, and she couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cChen Xi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dDuanmu Ze was extremely shocked as well, he then shook his head and casually patted Chen Xi\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBrother Chen, it\u2019s time to go.\u201dChen Xi\u2019s figure went stiff for a moment, then he spoke vaguely as if he\u2019d just awoken from a dream. \u201cOh, okay.\u201dNo one noticed that a trace of a bright light silently slipped past Chen Xi\u2019s gaze as he looked at the tall and imposing Crimsonflame Mountain Range.[1.

    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - Unexpected EventPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48 - Unexpected EventThe Crimsonflame Mountain Range occupied an area of 5,000 km, but who would have imagined that it was actually a grand formation?As they swiftly dashed within the Crimsonflame Mountain Range, Chen Xi recalled what Ji Yu had said earlier and couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in surprise.Earlier at the foot of the mountain, the reason he was staring blankly was that he was communicating with Ji Yu. According to Ji Yu\u2019s inference, the Crimsonflame Mountain Range before his eyes was a terrifying formation that gathered the baleful qi of heaven and earth, and only a grandmaster of talisman formations would be able to set-up such a formation!Chen Xi\u2019s attainments in the Dao of Talismans wasn\u2019t bad, but he was merely able to craft talismans. Moreover, he was only able to craft first-grade basic talismans. Whereas only when his talisman crafting attained a standard above the ninth-grade talisman master could he be called a talisman formation master.Talisman formation masters were divided into three levels: namely the high-level, intermediate-level, and low level. Above those was the grand talisman formation master. Further above that was the talisman formation grandmaster, and one who was able to become eminent amongst talisman formation grandmasters was able to be called as a supreme talisman formation grandmaster!Furthermore, a figure that was able to become a supreme talisman formation grandmaster had surely attained an unbelievable level in the Dao of Talisman Formations. Within the cultivation world, only immortal figures around the Earthly Immortal Realm were able to attain this level in the Dao of Talismans Formations.Moreover, the Dao of Talisman Formations was practically the most obscure and profound existence amongst all Daos, and also the Dao that expended the most amount of time. Unless it was some cultivators with heaven-defying natural talent, otherwise, it was absolutely difficult for someone to tread to the end of this path.Thus it could be seen how terrifying of an existence a supreme talisman crafting grandmaster was!\u201cThis grand formation ought to have fallen into disuse due to having no one to preside over it for years, otherwise, the baleful qi it gathered would absolutely not have leaked out. Like the boundless sea of baleful beasts you saw all this way are probably formed after a long time of accumulation of the baleful qi that\u2019s leaked from the grand formation.\u201dJi Yu\u2019s voice unhurriedly sounded out within Chen Xi\u2019s mind once again. \u201cKid, didn\u2019t you want to gather Netherezim Baleful Qi? Why don\u2019t you head to the core of this formation and search there? You might be able to collect some treasures used to set-up formations.\u201d\u201cThe treasure to collect baleful qi?\u201d\u201cExactly, it\u2019s utterly impossible to set-up a grand formation like this one without a formidable treasures as the foundation of the formation. Moreover, it\u2019s precisely because of the existence of these treasures that there are innumerable baleful beasts wreaking havoc everywhere within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.\u201dChen Xi pondered for a moment. It was exactly as Ji Yu had said, baleful beasts were formed from baleful qi. If there wasn\u2019t the boundless baleful qi to sustain it, those baleful beasts would have been annihilated a long time ago. How could they possibly be inexhaustible as they were now?Chen Xi was palpitating with excitement when he heard Ji Yu\u2019s descriptions, but when he thought of how he was still following Du Qingxi\u2019s group and he still had to head to the sword immortal\u2019s abode, he couldn\u2019t help but be slightly hesitant.\u201cChen Xi? What are you doing!?\u201d A stern shout exploded by his ear.At this moment, their group was heading forward on a precipitous and windy ledge within the Crimsonflame Mountain Range, on one side was a chilly precipice and on the other was a bottomless chasm.Mountain wind whistled by, seeming to want to blow them away, and below the chasm was crimson-red fog that ceaseless roiled. Numerous bloody beasts seemed to stay within the bottomless chasm, and sharp and terrifying beast roars would frequently echo out, causing chills to run down one\u2019s spine.Due to their cultivation being restrained, Du Qingxi and the other Violet Palace Realm cultivators were unable to fly, and thus as they walked between this precipitous cliffs, they were all extremely cautious, as they were deeply afraid that an accident would occur.Whereas Chen Xi instead walked at the front of the group. This was Chai Letian\u2019s arrangement and the purpose was self-evident. If a mishap was to appear ahead, Chen Xi would be the first to bear the brunt of it. It didn\u2019t matter if Chen Xi died or not, what was important was that he would be able to buy some time for the people behind him to react.Chen Xi turned his head back and he saw Chai Letian staring coldly at him with rage vaguely visible within his gaze, and Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be slightly stunned.It wasn\u2019t Chen Xi\u2019s fault that he would guess like this. Since the day they\u2019d departed from Bloodbath City, an intense competition unfolded between the pair of love rivals, Duanmu Ze and Chai Letian. As the leader, Chai Letian arrogantly ordered Duanmu Ze about at every chance, like he\u2019d already taken Duanmu Ze to be a servant. Duanmu Ze was naturally inwardly extremely hateful of this and went against Chai Letian in all respects. So long as it was an order of Chai Letian\u2019s, he wouldn\u2019t comply with a word of it, moreover, he would also drag Chen Xi along to go against Chai Letian, causing him to be extremely infuriated.It was precisely because of this that Chao Letian was not only infuriated with Duanmu Ze, but also hated the \u2018accomplice,\u2019 Chen Xi. Along the way, he\u2019d constantly reprimanded Chen Xi for seemingly nothing, as if is he didn\u2019t do so it would be insufficient to prove his identity as the leader.Even a weakling had a temper, and no matter how great Chen Xi\u2019s endurance was, he still couldn\u2019t help himself from feeling a trace of disgust and detest towards this Starnet Palace disciple.\u201cChen Xi, what\u2019s wrong? Is someone finding fault with you?\u201d Duanmu Ze shouted out from behind. As a good brother that acted together, he naturally had to express his displeasure when he saw Chai Letian looking for trouble with Chen Xi.\u201cI\u2019m finding fault with him?\u201d Chai Letian sneered. \u201cWe only have a day\u2019s time left. If we aren\u2019t able to leave the Crimsonflame Mountain Range in time, then we\u2019ll surely miss the opportunity to enter the sword immortal\u2019s abode and benefit Su Jiao\u2019s group for nothing. Are you willing to see this outcome?\u201d\u201cBut what does this have to do with Chen Xi?\u201d Duanmu Ze asked rhetorically.The nearby Du Qingxi frowned as well. During the journey here, she\u2019d noticed the secret struggle between Duanmu Ze and Chai Letian. But as the person concerned, it wasn\u2019t proper for her to butt in and stop the fight between two rivals in love. However, at this moment, when she saw Chai Letian targeting Chen Xi for no reason caused her to be unable to restrain herself from getting enraged.\u201cCould it be that everyone hasn\u2019t noticed that since Chen Xi led the group, our speed has obviously slowed down significantly? This fellow is obviously delaying us intentionally!\u201dChai Letian said coldly, \u201cI even suspect now that he might be a spy sent over from Su Jiao\u2019s side to delay our pace, in order to hold us up and miss the opportunity to enter the sword immortal\u2019s abode!\u201dChen Xi was stunned, and the detest he had towards Chai Letian\u2019s behavior in his heart had reached the utmost limit.\u201cHaha! You said Chen Xi\u2019s a spy from Su Jiao\u2019s side? Do you know what sort of relationship Chen Xi has with Su Jiao? Truly fucking absurd!\u201d When he heard this explanation, Duanmu Ze who\u2019d always been extremely caring about his bearing couldn\u2019t help but swear.\u201cThe one who asked Chen Xi to lead was you, the one who said Chen Xi\u2019s delaying the group is also you. Brother Chai, have you got something wrong?\u201d Du Qingxi\u2019s voice was chilly, and her words made no attempt to conceal her displeasure.\u201cOh, looking for trouble with Chen Xi again? Truly causing one to be unable to continue watching by.\u201d Song Lin opened his drowsy eyes, and a strand of cold light appeared within his pupils.\u201cYou can\u2019t put it like that. Brother Chai is only thinking for the sake of everyone, as our target is the sword immortal\u2019s abode after all. If others enter it before us, I\u2019m afraid it wouldn\u2019t be good for anyone, right?\u201d\u201cHmph! I and my brother support Brother Chai. According to my observation, that kid is obviously delaying!\u201d\u201cYes, my brother is right.\u201d\u201cEveryone, stop quarreling. Actually, Brother Chai is doing this for all our sakes.\u201dThe Myriadcloud Institution\u2019s Yu Haobai, the Windsoar Institution\u2019s Du Quan and Du Kui, and the Azurewood Institution\u2019s Murong Wei all spoke out, but leaned towards Chai Letian\u2019s side and supported him.Chai Letian never expected that only reprimanding Chen Xi would actually cause such a situation to appear, and he couldn\u2019t help but think inwardly.As he thought up to here, Chai Letian rubbed the scar on his left cheek as killing intent flashed within his eyes, then his right hand stretched out like lightning to suddenly grab onto the back of Chen Xi\u2019s clothes, then he swung his arm, directly tossing Chen Xi into the nearby chasm!Chen Xi completely never expected that Chai Letian would actually do this, and when he reacted to Chai Letian\u2019s actions, his entire body had already been tossed out tens of meters away to be atop the chasm. His body was in mid-air and he had no place to push himself against, and could only watch on as he drifted down like a rag, falling down towards the chasm.Chen Xi didn\u2019t exclaim in shock, nor did he shout. He only tightly closed his lips and stared fixedly at the figure that became further and further away. His rage was like burning and boiling lava that flowed throughout his body, causing his eyes to instantly go red from being filled with blood, and numerous blue veins popped out on his handsome face, revealing billowing hatred within his savage appearance!\u2026At the side of the precipice beside the chasm, the mountain winds were like howling dragons.It was deathly silent and only the howls of the bitter mountain wind resounded in the air.No one had expected that Chai Letian would take Chen Xi by surprise and attack him, and they furthermore never expected that Chai Letian would not even say anything before directly tossing Chen Xi into the chasm!This unexpected event arrived too swiftly and practically occurred in an instant. At the moment everyone hadn\u2019t even reacted to it, Chen Xi had already fallen into the chasm that was filled with roiling crimson-red fog and disappeared.\u201cDirty dog! Fuck your mother! I\u2019ll fucking kill you!\u201d Duanmu Ze was the first to recover from his shock, and he roared furiously as he leaped out wanting to fight Chai Letian to the death.The nearby Song Lin hurriedly stopped him, then shouted explosively. \u201cCalm down! The chasm is just to our side, could it be that you want to fall in as well?\u201d\u201cWhy did you do that!?\u201d Du Qingxi\u2019s expression was like ice, and flames of rage burned brilliantly within her clear eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s only an ant, his death makes no difference. Why make such a big deal of it?\u201d Chai Letian smiled as he patted his hands as if he\u2019d done something of little importance.\u201cYou\u2026 So ruthless!\u201d Chai Letian\u2019s attitude of not caring in the least caused Du Qingxi to be angered to the point her body lightly trembled. \u201cIf I had known earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to form an alliance with you.\u201dChai Letian frowned and said, \u201cQingxi, I\u2019ve already tolerated him all the way here. You want to have a falling out with me for the sake of an annoying little ant?\u201d His voice was low and vaguely carried a trace intimidation.Du Qingxi\u2019s expression froze and a wisp of powerlessness and dejection poured out from her eyes. She could have a falling out with Chai Letian, but the Du Clan behind her would absolutely not allow it, causing her to be unable to do so.\u201cLet me go! I\u2019ll fucking kill this dirty dog!\u201d Duanmu Ze was still shouting in rage.Song Lin tightly held onto him and shouted explosively via voice transmission. \u201cWake up! Do you want to bring a disaster to your Duanmu Clan? That Chai Letian is nothing to worry about, but the Nether Transformation Realm ancestor behind him is someone that our clans are absolutely unable to go against!\u201d\u201cCould it be that we\u2019re going to just let it go at that?\u201d Duanmu Ze muttered in dejection.A wisp of inexplicable bitterness surged at the corners of Song Lin\u2019s mouth. \u201cWhat else can we do? We can only hope that Chen Xi can survive. Don\u2019t forget that he\u2019s also a formidable body refiner. Even if he has nowhere to push himself against and save himself, but falling down the chasm might not be lethal\u2026\u201d His voice grew weaker and weaker, lower and lower. Obviously, he himself wasn\u2019t confident of what he said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - CavernPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49 - CavernBang!A black silhouette was like an enormous falling meteor as it fiercely smashed onto the jet-black rocks that were covered in dust and emitted a stifling bang.After an unknown amount of time, Chen Xi was stimulated awake by severe pain. The incomparable pain that was like his heart was pierced by ten thousand swords and bitten by a myriad of ants, caused him to slightly recover a trace of consciousness and open his eyes. What greeted his eyes was dense miasma and fog that was impossible to dissipate, and he was unable to clearly see his surroundings.The only thing Chen Xi could confirm was that he didn\u2019t die and this place was obviously the bottom of the chasm in the Crimsonflame Mountain Range.\u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d Accompanied by this voice, the surrounding bewitching blood red fog suddenly scattered away to reveal Ji Yu\u2019s thin face.Chen Xi stretched his body for a moment, and besides the fiery pain in his body, he didn\u2019t feel any other discomfort. He then gritted his teeth as he crawled up to a stand, and he was already sweating profusely from pain when he achieved this.\u201cExperiencing this incident is a good thing for you.\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s expression seemed extremely solemn, and he said in a low voice, \u201cYou must always remember that unless it\u2019s a friendship sword for life and death, otherwise, leaving your back to another is disrespect to your own life!\u201dChen Xi silently nodded. If he was slightly vigilant at that time, it would be unlikely that Chai Letian would have been successful in his surprise attack.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Ji Yu seemed to understand as well that this incident was a huge blow to Chen Xi, so when he saw Chen Xi acknowledging his view, he didn\u2019t speak any further. His figure swayed and the tip of his foot didn\u2019t touch the ground as he floated towards the depths of the fog like a little boat.Chen Xi glanced around at the surroundings, then asked in a daze. \u201cGo where?\u201d\u201c50 km forward from here is the location of the foundation of this formation. If you want to walk out of here then destroy its foundation.\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s voice floated out from within the fog.\u2026Baleful qi and fog billowed in the air and howls of baleful beasts resounded.Chen Xi followed behind Ji Yu. As he gazed upon the crimson-red fog that was dense like lava and the packs of baleful beasts that rampaged within the fog, his nerves were strained to the limit.He\u2019d even once seen a baleful beast that was the size of an entire hill slowly walking out of the fog, and the ferocious and terrifying aura that it emitted caused him to feel suffocated.However, surprisingly, so long as he followed behind Ji Yu, not only would the dense fog automatically scatter, but even those baleful beasts wouldn\u2019t dare approach. All along the way, they actually never encountered a single attack!After the time for an incense stick to burn.Ji Yu stopped before a jet-black rock wall within the chasm.Chen Xi raised his eyes to look and he saw that various dense patterns that were like decorative patterns were inscribed on the jet-black rock wall. The patterns were rough as if formed naturally, some places were already blurred and indistinct, and they carried an aged and desolate ancient aura.\u201cLooks like my inference is correct. Sure enough, this mountain range is a Baleful Condensation Formation.\u201dJi Yu sized up the patterns on the rock wall for a moment before walking forward, then he swished his sleeve and a wisp of dense azure fog swept out and struck against the rock wall.Bang! Bang! Bang!The jet-black rock wall with innumerable patterns inscribed on it opened up from the center to reveal a pitch-black cavern. At the same time, an extremely icy cold aura whistled out. Everywhere it passed, a layer of thick black ice was instantly condensed on the ground!Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but shudder when this icy cold aura blew upon him and his teeth chattered. He hurriedly circulated his True Essence, and only then was he able to dissolve the icy cold aura that invaded his body.After following behind Ji Yu to enter the cavern, Chen Xi saw clearly the environment within.This place seemed to be an extremely ancient cavern with dark-azure rock walls that were craggy and mottled surrounding the cavern. The natural marbling seemed crude and dull, without a trace of artificial polishing.Furthermore, at the center of the cavern was a pool in the shape of an octagonal prism. Eight swords with oppressively cold gleams were inserted within the eight corners of the pool. Circles of ripples appeared atop the pure black colored milky liquid that was slowly flowing within the pool, and a bone piercing icy coldness diffused out from it.The most eye-catching of it all was a fully bloomed black lotus in the center of the pool. The lotus had 36 petals that were like black jade and glowed with a trace of a calming energy.Ji Yu walked around the side of the pool then shook his head and sighed. \u201cThere are baleful qi drawing swords, a baleful qi condensing lotus, and and eight containment bottle to hold the baleful qi. The person who set-up this formation prepared fully, but unfortunately, the quality of these are all too inferior. Moreover, it lacks a Spirit Drawing Pearl. Without someone to control the formation, it could only lay waste until now.\u201dChen Xi was completely muddled and said inwardly,\u201cHowever, these things are still usable to you.\u201d Ji Yu pondered for a moment then flicked his sleeve. The eight swords at the side of the pool cried out in unison, then lifted off the ground and transformed into eight dazzlingly bright flowing lights as they descended onto Ji Yu\u2019s palm.\u201cThese eight swords were originally heaven-rank Magic Treasures, but unfortunately they\u2019ve been sealed here for too long and have experienced the corrosion of Netherezim Baleful Qi for countless years. Now, they are at most have the might of a top-grade yellow-rank Magic Treasures.\u201dJi Yu evaluated before tossing the eight swords to Chen Xi, then he once again flicked his sleeve and the black lotus at the center of the pool was pulled out by the roots and descended onto his palm.\u201cThis lotus isn\u2019t bad. It\u2019s an Icesoul Heartlotus that\u2019s born from the heaven and the earth. Placing it by your side while cultivating will provide the marvelous effect of wiping out your inner demons and cleansing your mind.\u201dAs he spoke, Ji Yu extended his hand to lightly stroke the black lotus and strands of baleful qi dissipated out from the lotus, instantly transforming it into a snow white lotus that emitted a cool and refreshing aura. \u201cI\u2019ve already helped you get rid of the baleful qi contained within this lotus, take it!\u201dChen Xi glanced at the row of tiny flying swords in his right palm, then glanced at the Icesoul Heartlotus he\u2019d just obtained, and his heart was filled with excitement.In the cultivation world, weapons were divided into two main categories according to their quality, namely mortal weapons and Magic Treasures.Postnatal Realm cultivators and Congenital Realm cultivators were only able to utilize mortal weapons, and the Azurebolt Sword that Chen Xi used before was a high-grade mortal weapon.Only after developing his Violet Palace and establishing his Dao Foundation would he be able to control a Magic Treasure.Magic Treasures were divided into four ranks, namely the yellow-rank, profound-rank, earth-rank and heaven-rank. Every rank was further divided into four grades, namely the low-grade, intermediate-grade, high-grade and top-grade.Furthermore, above Magic Treasures were Immortal Artifacts!However, to Chen Xi, an Immortal Artifact was too far away after all, as it was practically an existence that could only be chanced upon by luck and not sought after. At this moment, possessing eight top-grade yellow-rank flying swords had already caused him to be uncontrollably happy.Moreover, the Icesoul Heartlotus was marvelous and extraordinary. With it in his possession, not only would he be able to repel his inner demons to prevent qi deviation, it was even able to provide great benefits to his cultivation speed.\u201cThese eight swords experienced the corrosion of Netherezim Baleful Qi for 10,000 years, but have fallen into my hands in the end. It\u2019s a type of fate as well, why don\u2019t I call them Netherezim Swords?\u201dChen Xi had already rushed to start naming his Magic Treasures, then he frowned as he said inwardly,\u201cChen Xi, the baleful qi within this pool is dense to the point it has turned liquid. It\u2019s extremely suitable for you to temper your physique.\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s voice sounded out from beside the pool.Chen Xi hurriedly tossed the Netherezim Swords and Icesoul Heartlotus into his storage ring, then walked over and asked, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201dJi Yu pointed at the pool. \u201cJump in and circulate the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts. But you must be careful, even though this baleful qi can\u2019t compare to the baleful qi from the stars, it\u2019s still the renowned Netherezim Baleful Qi that\u2019s incomparably cold. If you feel you\u2019re unable to persist, then quickly come out.\u201dChen Xi didn\u2019t hesitate as he removed his clothes right away, then walked towards the pool.The instant his skin came into contact with the layer of pure black colored liquid within the pool, a bone piercing icy coldness was like an awl as it fiercely pierced into his skin before flowing throughout his body. Chen Xi\u2019s face instantly became a bluish violet color and his body shivered violently and uncontrollably.Hu!Chen Xi didn\u2019t dare delay and sat in the pool with a splash. The instant he did this, he concentrated his mind and abandoned all distracting thoughts before swiftly circulating the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts.The liquid form Netherezim Baleful qi within the pool was just enough to cover Chen Xi\u2019s neck to only reveal his head. He tightly shut his eyes as a layer of thick black ice was instantly condensed over his face. From far away, Chen Xi was like a wax sealed stone carving.\u201cThis kid is so obedient, he actually didn\u2019t ask me why I wanted him to do that\u2026\u201dJi Yu took out his wine gourd and took a few gulps, then shook his head and sighed. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ve taken too good care of him. Too much dependence will cause him to forever be unable to become a true expert.\u201d\u201cHowever, once he advances to the Violet Palace Realm and passes the first level of the Heavenpeak of Trials, I\u2019ll probably be unable to come out any longer. Mmm, I\u2019ll just continue taking care of him. All those years ago, Master took good care like this as well\u2026\u201dHis voice grew lower and lower before gradually fading away. Ji Yu seemed to have recalled some past event that he couldn\u2019t bear to look back onto, and a wisp of sorrow that was dense to the point it couldn\u2019t be dispelled appeared within his eyes that had experienced many vicissitudes of life.Chen Xi felt an icy river flowing between the flesh, blood, and bones of his entire body, and that icy coldness that suffused out from within his body caused him to gradually lose all consciousness.However, his soul still maintained extreme lucidity and calmness as he systematically circulated his mental cultivation method to slowly absorb drop after drop of the terrifying Netherezim Baleful Qi, using this to temper the skin, bones, flesh and muscles.Compared to the pain that the baleful qi of the stars brought to him, the icy cold feeling caused by this Netherezim Baleful Qi was instead much less of a burden to Chen Xi.Currently, Chen Xi\u2019s cultivation in body refinement had already broken through to the Congenital Realm a long time ago. At this moment, continuing to cultivate intently with the help of the Netherezim Baleful Qi caused his cultivation to advance at a noticeable speed.Three days later.A wave of cracking sounds from something shattering into tiny pieces suddenly sounded out within the quiet cavern.Chen Xi stood up within the pool as the thick layer of black ice that had condensed atop his skin shattered piece by piece and trickled down like powder. Revealing a formidable physique with perfect and masculine lines, like a masterpiece that was chiseled out by the hand of a god and was full of an enchanting luster.Swoosh!Chen Xi stretched his muscles and felt the vital energy within his entire body was boiling, seeming as if he could lift a mountain with a raise of his hand.Moreover, numerous faint black patterns were vaguely visible on his backbone and seemed to be extremely mysterious.Ji Yu lay on the rattan chair as his gaze swept Chen Xi\u2019s back and he said indifferently, \u201cVeins of shaman markings have appeared on his back. Looks like his body refinement cultivation has advanced to the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm.\u201dChen Xi was stunned speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - Note Within the Immortals AbodePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50 - Note Within the Immortal\u2019s AbodeChen Xi had never considered himself to be a cultivation genius, but this body refinement cultivation speed still startled him. If he were to carefully count it, he\u2019d only refined his body for not even half a year and he\u2019d already advanced to the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm from the Postnatal Realm in one go. This speed was something even he was nearly unable to believe.\u201cAre you extremely shocked? You\u2019re cultivating the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts my Master passed down, and further possessed an enormous amount of Netherezim Baleful Qi to support your cultivating. A speed like this can only be considered as normal.\u201dJi Yu said indifferently, \u201cWork hard. Compared to those true geniuses, this cultivation speed of your is extremely terrible. Most importantly, you\u2019ve already wasted 16 years of time.\u201dChen Xi\u2019s excited mood calmed down significantly as the facts were exactly like Ji Yu had said. Since he was young, although he\u2019d always received the teachings of his grandfather and cultivated the Violet Sky Arts qi refinement cultivation technique passed down in his clan, he lacked the support of spirit pills and spirit stones, causing the advancement of his cultivation to be extremely slow. Moreover, four years ago, due to needing to bring home the bacon, he even took on the heavy responsibility of becoming the breadwinner of the family and became a talisman crafting apprentice, causing the time he spent on cultivating to become even less. Compared to the disciples of clans that concentrated on cultivating since a young age, he was extremely far behind.Just like Li Huai who was of similar age to Chen Xi, but had now already attained a Violet Palace Realm cultivation. The reason lay at Li Huai possessing countless resources of every type. He utterly didn\u2019t have to labor for the sake of survival.\u201cThank you Senior, for your timely warning.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s expression was solemn, and staunchness and seriousness filled the space between his brows.Ji Yu laughed as he stood up from the rattan chair, then swept the pool with his gaze and said, \u201cThere\u2019s still nearly 250 kg of liquid condensed from Netherezim Baleful Qi. I\u2019ll help you collect it.\u201dHe stuck out his palm as he spoke, and the entire octagonal prism shaped pool fiercely roiled, then a black light flashed, and the pool had already transformed into an octagonal containment bottle that seemed to be made of black jade.\u201cActually, this pool is an octagonal containment bottle. The cultivator who set up this formation first used the baleful qi drawing swords to connect with the baleful qi of heaven and earth, then used the Icesoul Heartlotus to cultivate the baleful qi, and in the end, they were gathered within the octagonal containment bottle. This pool of Netherezim Baleful Qi was only formed after 10,000 years of time.\u201dJi Yu spoke in a calm and unhurried manner, seeming to be extremely patient as he continued. \u201cBut due to this Baleful Condensation Formation having no one to control it for nearly 10,000 years, most of the Netherezim Baleful Qi within has dissipated. If it wasn\u2019t for this, this pool would at least be able to gather no less than 5,000 kg of Netherezim Baleful Qi.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Chen Xi nodded.Ji Yu tossed to octagonal containment bottle to Chen Xi and said, \u201cEven though this thing has no other use, it isn\u2019t bad to store some spirit liquids or wine. Once you advance to the Rebirth Realm, you can use the Netherezim Baleful Qi within to condense a Rebirth Wheel.\u201dChen Xi carefully put away the octagonal containment bottle within his storage ring and his gaze inadvertently glanced around. He noticed that there was shockingly a bizarre formation pattern at the location where the pool was once.\u201cThis is?\u201d Chen Xi walked forward to take a look. There was a depressed slot at the center of the formation patterns. A flash of inspiration flashed through his mind, and he withdrew the Nether Enlightenment Token from his storage ring right away. With a slight comparison, he noticed they just happened to perfectly embed seamlessly within the depression!\u201cHahaha!\u201dJi Yu lifted his head and laughed. \u201cExactly. It\u2019s precisely the teleportation formation that heads to the sword immortal\u2019s abode. I noticed something was fishy when I entered here earlier. According to my deduction, this formation was surely set-up by that sword immortal for the sake of gathering the Netherezim Baleful Qi!\u201dChen Xi did indeed slightly dare not believe this. He\u2019d originally thought that once he\u2019d fallen down the chasm, he\u2019d completely lost all fate with the sword immortal\u2019s abode. He never imagined that he\u2019d actually find an unexpected way here. It\u2019s truly as the saying goes, every cloud has a silver lining.\u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ve already seen many peerless sword immortals during these millions of years, but all of them died with deep regret within my Master\u2019s Manor. Let me see who exactly this sword immortal is, and what marvels the abode he left behind contains.\u201d Ji Yu spoke unhurriedly, his casual tone revealed arrogance that looked down on everything.\u2026Waves of explosive shouts frequently echoed out from within the long and narrow passageway that was pitch-black, and along with the shouts was the terrifying sound of metal clashing.Whoosh!The Unity Azurelotus Dagger transformed into a dim azure rainbow as it fiercely slashed a baleful qi puppet into pieces. Du Qingxi was in a slightly sorry state and was breathing heavily as she gazed upon Duanmu Ze and the others who still gritted their teeth in battle, her beautiful face filled with anxiousness.Under the leadership of Chai Letian, they\u2019d finally passed through the Crimsonflame Mountain Range while encountering terrifying situations, but coming out unscathed. At the last day of the one month time period, they\u2019d relied on the Nether Enlightenment Token to be sent to the sword immortal\u2019s abode via the teleportation formation.They\u2019d initially thought that various Magic Treasures and secret techniques were within reach, but they never imagined that at the instant they entered the long and narrow passageway, they\u2019d encounter wave after wave of baleful qi puppets.These baleful qi puppets were incomparably tall and big with hideous and stiff faces. Black colored baleful qi coiled around their entire bodies and each of their hands held a sharp, enormous sword. Their sword technique was simple and crude, but they relied on their fearless imposing aura, coupled with their enormous physiques that were hard like rocks. They were virtually like a mighty torrent of iron and steel that pushed right through the long and narrow passageway, sweeping away everything in their path.\u201cDammit! These stupid things simply are simply unending no matter how many we kill. We\u2019ve already been trapped here for two days. If this were to go on, sooner or later we\u2019ll die from exhaustion.\u201dDuanmu Ze kicked a baleful qi puppet flying then leaped up to dodge the pincer attack of two baleful qi puppets to arrive by Du Qingxi\u2019s side in a sorry state.At this moment, Duanmu Ze\u2019s white clothes were tainted with blood and his hair was disheveled. His handsome face was covered in a layer of sickly white and his brows revealed extreme exhaustion.\u201cWhy did it turn out like this? Since we entered this place, our strengths have recovered to the Violet Palace Realm and aren\u2019t restricted by the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain any longer. But we\u2019re utterly unable to finish off all these baleful qi puppets. Why don\u2019t\u2026we charge through?\u201dDu Qingxi was at a loss for what to do as well, although she suggested charging through, when she saw the dense mass of baleful qi puppets that were surging over from far away, she herself felt that their hope of charging through was extremely slim.\u201cCharge? I think we don\u2019t have much hope.\u201d Duanmu Ze smiled bitterly, then gnashed his teeth and said, \u201cWe originally had eight passageways to choose from, but Chai Letian just had to lead us on this passageway. If it wasn\u2019t for this, would we have come to such a sorry state?\u201dDu Qingxi frowned and said, \u201cIs what you\u2019re saying any different from how Chai Letian treated Chen Xi that day? Don\u2019t push everything onto someone else.\u201dShe stopped for a moment and felt she\u2019d spoken too harshly, then she said helplessly, \u201cFortune, Misfortune, Compliment, Slander, Praise, Ridicule, Pain, and Joy, eight different passageways. We chose the passageway of Joy and have already been trapped to such an extent. If we were to have chosen the passageway of Pain, wouldn\u2019t it mean that we would have died long ago?\u201dDuanmu Ze sneered. \u201cI just feel that Chai Letian was extremely ridiculous. He thought that since his name had the word \u2018Joy\u2019[1. The Le in Chai Letian means joy.] in it, so he led us on this path. Isn\u2019t this rubbish?\u201dSwoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!Three enormous swords contained a violent aura as they fiercely cleaved towards Du Qingxi and Duanmu Ze. The two of them didn\u2019t dare continue chatting and gritted their teeth as they moved over to meet the baleful qi puppet in battle.At this moment, they could only bitterly hang on like this.\u201cThese goddamn pieces of scrap, I\u2019ve fucking had enough!\u201d Not long after, Chai Letian roared in explosive rage, then he abruptly leaped up as a wisp of a dazzling and resplendent light suddenly appeared within his palm before being fiercely swung out by him.\u201cHeavenblaze Yin-Yang Talisman! Fucking explode! Explode! Explode!\u201dBang! Bang! Bang!An eye piercing white light suddenly lit up the surroundings and waves of explosions that were like thunderclaps resounded out within the narrow and long passageway. The violent streams of air were like a gale as they pressed forward through the passageway, and everywhere it passed, the numerous baleful qi puppets were like ice melting into water before being blazed to nothingness!Duanmu Ze stared blankly at the empty passageway and gnashed his teeth after a short moment. \u201cDamn asshole! He possessed a Heavenblaze Yin-Yang Talisman, a treasure that\u2019s fully capable of being on par with a full strength attack of a Golden Hall Realm cultivator, but he only used it now! He truly has vicious intentions!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s hurry up and leave. Once we\u2019re late then Su Jiao\u2019s group might beat us to the punch!\u201d Du Qingxi heaved a long sigh of relief and wiped off the sweat on her forehead before leaping forward.\u201cOh!\u201d Duanmu Ze didn\u2019t dare dally when he thought of the treasures within the sword immortal\u2019s abode and rushed over.\u2026\u201cI never expected that this \u2018Praise\u2019 passageway would actually be filled with various booby traps, it\u2019s easy to dodge a spear in the open, but difficult to dodge an arrow shot from the shadows. If it wasn\u2019t for the surrounding defense of Brother Cang\u2019s Foursoul Blackturtle Shield at this moment, I\u2019m afraid all of us would be trapped here this time.\u201dWithin another passageway, Su Jiao gazed at the far away exit and secretly heaved a sigh of relief, then she smiled sweetly to Cang Bin who was beside her.\u201cHaha! Miss Su, you\u2019re too kind.\u201d Cang Bin felt pained due to more than half of the spirit properties of the Foursoul Blackturtle Shield being destroyed. When he heard this, he couldn\u2019t help but squeeze out a smile.Su Jiao seemed to have seen through Cang Bin\u2019s thoughts and smiled as she suggested. \u201cIf we\u2019re able to obtain the secret stash within the sword immortal\u2019s abode this time, then we must first let Brother Cang pick an item in repayment for Brother Cang saving our lives. Everyone doesn\u2019t have any objections, right?\u201d\u201cNaturally.\u201d\u201cThis is indeed what Fellow Daoist Cang ought to get.\u201d The other people nodded and voiced their agreement at once.Cang Bin\u2019s mood was instantly elated and a trace of admiration was revealed within the burning gaze he shot at Su Jiao.\u201cWe have no time to lose, let\u2019s quickly head out. We mustn\u2019t let the others beat us to the punch.\u201d Su Jiao lightly smiled then turned around and moved towards the passage exit.\u2026Whoosh!When Chen Xi opened his eyes, he was already within an empty and spacious room.Besides a jade bed, a work table, and a meditation cushion, there was nothing else within the room.Chen Xi was extremely bewildered.Ji Yu stood before the work table and seemed to have nothing something, and he exclaimed in surprise. \u201cEh?\u201dChen Xi hurriedly moved closer and he saw that there actually was a yellowish note on the work table filled with words.These words were written freely in both vertical and horizontal lines, and every stroke was like a peerlessly swift and fierce sword. The instant Chen Xi gazed upon it, Sword Insight that was like a wave carried along a dense aura of slaughter as it assaulted his face, causing his entire body to instantly go stiff and cold sweat to stream down from his forehead. Chen Xi hurriedly turned away and closed his eyes before taking a deep breath, only then did he open his eyes to continue looking at it.\u201cI debated about the sword with Huai Yazi and attained sudden insight into the truth behind the eight things that can move a person\u2019s heart[1. The eight things refers to Fortune, Misfortune, Compliment, Slander, Praise, Ridicule, Pain, and Joy; which just happen to be the names of the eight passageways from before.]. I severed my fate with the mortal world and broke through the cage that bound me. I felt that I\u2019d obtained the true essence of the Sword Dao, however, I was obsessed with the sword, and my obsession eventually turned into an inner demon. Just like the saying, my success came from the sword, and so did my downfall\u2026\u201dChen Xi had only read a few rows of words when he felt a feeling of detest and agitation surge within his chest, and his Dao Heart shook and faltered. He couldn\u2019t endure it and once again closed his eyes.\u201cThis note was written by a sword immortal who\u2019d comprehended a Grand Dao of the sword. Your cultivation isn\u2019t high enough. Forcefully reading it will cause your soul to be injured or even cause your Dao Heart to be vulnerable to inner demons. You shouldn\u2019t read it again.\u201dJi Yu\u2019s voice sounded out by his ear, and it raised a violent storm in Chen Xi\u2019s heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - Treasure HallPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51 - Treasure Hall\u201cThis fellow whose Dao name is Nether Enlightenment is indeed an extremely formidable sword immortal, since he was able to attain a Grand Dao of the sword.\u201d Ji Yu picked up the note and viewed it for a short moment, then he shook his head and sighed. \u201cUnfortunately, he only overcame eight of the nine levels of heavenly tribulation. He was only a step away from ascending into the ranks of Heavenly Immortals. If you carefully consider it, this fellow, Nether Enlightenment, can only be considered to be a formidable fallen sword immortal.\u201dChen Xi extremely shocked inwardly. Even a fallen immortal was a terrifying existence that was currently difficult for him to reach.Poof!The yellowish note that was written with blood-red cinnabar suddenly lit ablaze within Ji Yu\u2019s hand and transformed into ash that scattered into the air.\u201cWhy did you destroy it?\u201d Chen Xi asked in astonishment. Every word on this note was filled with dense and mighty Sword Insight; observing and understanding it would be extremely beneficial to cultivating sword techniques.Ji Yu had his hands behind his back as he said indifferently, \u201cA Sword Dao that can\u2019t even withstand the heavenly tribulation is not worth learning.\u201dChen Xi still felt it was a pity and said in a daze, \u201cBut, I can learn from his strong points to overcome my own weak points.\u201d\u201cYou have to remember that the most important thing on the path of sword cultivation is to possess a pure heart towards the sword that\u2019s firm and tenacious. This note was left behind by him when he was obsessed to the point it became an inner demon. His aura is irritable and in disorder, and the Sword Dao atop the note is extremely disorderly. Using it to learn and train would only destroy the path of your Sword Dao.\u201dJi Yu said emotionally, \u201cOne day, if you\u2019re able to pass the 13th level of the Heavenpeak of Trials, and see the unparalleled Sword Insight left behind by that peerless sword immortal when he tried to get through the Heavenpeak of Trials, you\u2019ll understand what the true path of a sword cultivator is.\u201d\u201cNo matter how formidable he was, didn\u2019t he still die there?\u201dWhen he first met Ji Yu, Chen Xi had once heard Ji Yu mention that during this 1 million years, for the sake of obtaining the inheritance left by Ji Yu\u2019s master, countless formidable cultivators had once challenged the Heavenpeak of Trials. Moreover, amongst them, the most formidable was a peerless sword immortal from hundreds of thousands of years ago. But, the sword immortal had merely passed the 13th level of the Heavenpeak of Trials before meeting his end.Ji Yu shook his head, then sighed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the same, it isn\u2019t the same.\u201dThe note had already turned to ash, so saying any more was of no use. Chen Xi quickly placed his attention onto the surroundings, and as he looked at the empty room, he couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cSenior Ji Yu, this is really the sword immortal\u2019s abode?\u201d\u201cIf my inference isn\u2019t mistaken, then this is the main hall that the immortal, Nether Enlightenment, stayed in.\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s gaze swept the surroundings, and he suddenly stretched out his hand to point at the jade bed. \u201cSit on it and circulate your True Essence.\u201dA flash of wisdom appeared in Chen Xi\u2019s mind when he heard this, and said, \u201cThis jade bed wouldn\u2019t be the control center of the entire sword immortal\u2019s abode, right?\u201d\u201cExactly. But with your current strength, you\u2019re still unable to bind this immortal estate. You can only rely on it to observe the entire immortal estate.\u201dAs the spirit of the Manor that had lived for a million years, Ji Yu obviously knew all of this like the back of his hand, and casually said, \u201cIf you want to obtain some valuable treasures, then you should quickly figure out the distribution of this immortal estate. Take action swiftly. You\u2019re already later than those people by three days after all.\u201dChen Xi naturally didn\u2019t dare dally. When he sat on the jade bed, he felt a cool and refreshing stream of air suffuse into his entire body, causing his mind to be unable to refrain from becoming calm. Obviously, this jade bed had a marvelous effect towards cultivating as well.Om!As soon as he circulated his True Essence, Chen Xi felt his mind chime, and a lifelike image suddenly appeared before his eyes. On the top of the image were labels that said Book Reserve Hall, Treasure Hall, etc. Shockingly, it was the layout map of this immortal estate!Chen Xi viewed them one by one and couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in shock.It turned out that this sword immortal\u2019s estate was extremely enormous, covering an area of about 500 km. The outer area of the estate was eight winding passageways that were long and narrow, and they were respectively named as Fortune, Misfortune, Compliment, Slander, Praise, Ridicule, Pain, and Joy; implying the truth behind the eight things that can move a person\u2019s heart.A terrifying Triple Goldenarc Sword Formation was concealed within the \u2018Fortune\u2019 passageway, countless demonic souls roamed about the \u2018Misfortune\u2019 passageway, Blackflame Lava from the core of the land flowed like a large river within the \u2018Slander\u2019 passageway\u2026Regardless of which passageway, terrifying killing intent was concealed within all of them!Chen Xi shuddered with fear as he saw this and said inwardly, \u201cIf I were to enter the estate through these eight passageways with my current cultivation, I\u2019m afraid it would basically be courting death.\u201dThe end of the eight passageways was the core area of the estate, and it was once again divided into four areas which were respectively the Book Reserve Hall, Treasure Hall, Hundred Herb Hall, and Martial Dao Hall. At the center of these four great halls was the main hall that Chen Xi currently resided in, and it was also the control center of the entire estate.Within these four secondary halls, various chambers were densely distributed like an ant hill, and what treasure was stored within was unknown.However, Chen Xi was elated that the main hall he resided in just happened to be able to lead directly to these four secondary halls, and the way was without booby traps.\u201cSenior Ji Yu, do you think I should go to the Treasure Hall or Book Reserve Hall first?\u201dChen Xi was slightly hesitant. Just as its name implied, the Treasure Hall surely contained the various Magic Treasures and weapons left behind by the immortal, Nether Enlightenment. Whereas the Book Reserve Hall naturally contained various cultivation techniques. These two categories of things obviously possessed equally great temptation to a cultivator.As for the Hundred Herb Hall that cultivated treasures of heaven and earth, its temptation was equally great. But to Chen Xi, its attractiveness was far inferior to the Treasure Hall and Book Reserve Hall.Whereas the Martial Dao Hall would presumably be the place the immortal, Nether Enlightenment, trained his martial techniques, and its attractiveness to Chen Xi wasn\u2019t great.\u201cHmm?\u201d Before Ji Yu could even speak, Chen Xi suddenly noticed that there were shockingly ten plus white halos moving on the map and had already left the \u2018Praise\u2019 passageway.\u201cThe white halos ought to represent the cultivators that have entered the estate so that the immortal, Nether Enlightenment, would be able to control everything from here.\u201dChen Xi pondered inwardly for a short moment before his heart shook as he realized a trace of something wrong. \u201cThere are only eight people in Chai Letian\u2019s group, so these white halos ought to be Su Jiao\u2019s group, and looking at the direction they are heading, it\u2019s precisely the Treasure Hall\u2026 This won\u2019t do! I absolutely can\u2019t allow them to benefit!\u201dWhoosh!Chen Xi stood up and charged out without hesitation.\u201cWhat have you found?\u201d Ji Yu floated in the air as he followed Chen Xi. He didn\u2019t look at the map but was able to discern that Chen Xi\u2019s expression was off.\u201cSomeone is entering the Treasure Hall soon.\u201d Chen Xi replied as he dashed rapidly.\u201cThat little Su Clan girl?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOh, we\u2019ll completely clean out the Treasure Hall and cause her to be unable to obtain a single treasure. It\u2019s indeed an extremely happy thing. Chen Xi, I support you in doing this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Xi was stunned,In next to no time, the two of them went along the side door to rush into the Treasure Hall.\u201cSo many secret chambers?\u201dChen Xi\u2019s head couldn\u2019t help but ache at the moment he entered the Treasure Hall and gazed at the zigzag corridor that was filled with chambers. If he were to search them one by one, he didn\u2019t know how long it would take before he was able to find the true location that the treasures were hidden in.\u201cFollow me!\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s gaze swept the surroundings, and he was silent for a moment before floating along the corridor to head deep into the Treasure Hall.Chen Xi was extremely elated in his heart as he followed Ji Yu.\u2026Bang! Bang! Bang!Not long after Chen Xi\u2019s figure had vanished deep within the corridor, the main door of the Treasure Hall that had been sealed for 10,000 years was opened.\u201cThis is the Treasure Hall?\u201d As she felt the pure and thick spirit energy that flowed in the air and gazed at the numerous chambers that densely covered and extended into the depths of the Treasure Hall, Su Jiao couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in surprise and her eyes were filled with burning desire.\u201cHaha! Our luck is too good indeed!\u201d Cang Bin laughed loudly with an expression that was extremely elated. \u201cI heard that immortal estates are divided into various great halls, but in terms of the most valuable, it was undoubtedly the Treasure Hall that stored various treasures.\u201d\u201cEveryone, we have no time to lose. Since so many chambers exist here, we can only split up. As for whether we\u2019re able to find any treasures, it will be up to our own fate.\u201d Su Jiao said with an excited tone.\u201cHaha! Precisely! If your luck has arrived, then you might be able to obtain an immortal treasure!\u201d Cang Bin was extremely excited as well.\u201cThen let\u2019s split up!\u201d\u201cOK! This suggestion isn\u2019t bad. There are so many treasures and if we rely on our own fate, then the problem of dividing the treasures wouldn\u2019t exist. It couldn\u2019t be better.\u201dThe other people spoke out in approval.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!All of them swiftly dispersed and dashed towards the chambers in various places within Treasure Hall.\u2026They dashed forward for the time an incense stick took to burn before Ji Yu abruptly stopped, his gaze shooting towards the nearby chamber that seemed ordinary.\u201cNo wonder. So the door is actually suffused with a trace of the aura of Chaotic Lifesoil[1. Chaos here refers to the scene when the world was created].\u201d A rare trace of surprise was emitted from Ji Yu\u2019s ancient eyes.Whereas when Chen Xi heard the word \u2018Chaotic Lifesoil\u2019 his entire body went still and he almost didn\u2019t dare believe his ears.The Chaotic Lifesoil was a rare item that wasn\u2019t within the five elements. According to legend, at the chaotic times during the absolute beginning of the world, numerous beings of the chaotic era were born from Chaotic Lifesoil. Once the heaven and earth were separated from each other and the three dimensions were established, Chaotic Lifesoil was buried within boundless time and had never appeared ever again.Of course, this was merely a legend Chen Xi had heard and its truth couldn\u2019t be verified. But when he found out that a trace of the aura of Chaotic Lifesoil was actually suffused on the chamber door before him, Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be shocked fiercely.\u201cThis trace of Chaotic Lifesoil aura has already become extremely faint, and it can\u2019t be gathered at all.\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s eyes faintly gazed at the chamber door and muttered to himself. \u201cBut, this chamber door actually has a trace of Chaotic Lifesoil aura, the thing stored within is surely extraordinary.\u201dAs he spoke, Ji Yu casually pushed open the chamber door.Whoosh!The door had only just been slightly opened when a black silhouettes shot out swiftly like lightning.\u201cI knew long ago that this would happen\u2026 Want to run? It isn\u2019t that easy!\u201dJi Yu smiled indifferently, and he flicked his sleeve as he spoke. A misty azure fog flowed like a waterfall as it swept out to instantly envelop that black silhouette before dropping onto Ji Yu\u2019s palm.The Azure fog dispersed to reveal the appearance of the black silhouette, and to Chen Xi\u2019s astonishment, the black silhouette was actually a fist-sized infant beast!Roar!The infant beast was entirely white as snow and furry, like a mini white lion. When it saw Chen Xi gazing over, it glared with its pitch black and clear little eyes, then bared its fangs as it emitted a roar, but its roar was extremely tender and didn\u2019t possess the slightest bit of deterrent force.\u201cIt\u2019s actually an infant Pixiu[1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixiu.]!\u201dWhen he saw this infant beast, Ji Yu who\u2019d always been indifferent as if he\u2019d see through all worldly matters emitted a rare and involuntary exclaim of shock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - PixiuPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52 - PixiuPixiu!Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but gasp when he heard that this little fist-sized and snow white infant beast was actually a Pixiu!A Pixiu was a primordial divine beast, and it was an existence amongst divine beasts with the most unique status. It devoured and collected the myriad of treasures of the world, and was looked up to as a symbol of auspiciousness since ancient times, as it possessed the bizarre ability to turn misfortune into luck.\u201cI never expected that a fallen sword immortal would actually be able to draw a Pixiu over to accumulate karmic luck for him, it\u2019s truly heaven defying good fortune.\u201d Ji Yu gazed at the Pixiu in his palm and repeatedly praised.\u201cAccumulate karmic luck?\u201d Chen Xi was slightly muddled. According to his knowledge, karmic luck was unreal and difficult to understand. It was absolutely not something that could be seen with the naked eye, and it seemed extremely rare for there to be a method to change one\u2019s karmic luck.However, there was a publically acknowledged saying in the cultivation world, a person with exuberant karmic luck would usually receive providence from the Dao of the Heavens. The person\u2019s cultivation would be ever successful and achieved without effort, moreover, the person would possess great fortune and obtain various enviable lucky encounters. Whereas a person with insufficient karmic luck would have a life full of misfortune. Although this misfortune wasn\u2019t terrible to the extent of attracting an unexpected calamity, the person would have no chance of having any great luck during the person\u2019s lifetime.Of course, due to karmic luck being unreal and impossible to be noticed with the naked eye, the karmic luck of everyone would change according to various things that occurred.At this moment, when he heard the Pixiu was actually able to accumulate the unreal karmic luck, it was obvious how shocked Chen Xi\u2019s mind was.Ji Yu nodded. \u201cExactly. Towards ordinary people in the world, a Pixiu is an auspicious beast that brings in wealth and treasure. But to cultivators, possessing a Pixiu at their side, they would be completely capable of turning a person\u2019s life around, or even the karmic luck of an entire sect!\u201dAs he spoke up to here, Ji Yu\u2019s expression was complicated and he went silent for a long time, then he sighed. \u201cIn short, you\u2019ll understand the use of karmic luck once your cultivation attains the Heavenly Immortal Realm.\u201dHeavenly Immortal Realm again?Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but recall the instructions of his mother, Zuoqiu Xue. She\u2019d said that only when he\u2019d attained the Heavenly Immortal Realm would he be able to see her, otherwise, it would only be a disaster and not fortune.Whereas at this moment, because of a fist-sized infant Pixiu and the divine ability it possesses to accumulate karmic luck once again involved attaining the Heavenly Immortal Realm, causing Chen Xi to faintly feel that it seemed that he would only have the qualifications to do anything he wanted to do once he attained the Heavenly Immortal Realm.\u201cHmm?\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s expression slightly twitched as he seemed to have noticed something, and he said, \u201cSomeone has entered the Treasure Hall, we have to take action quickly.\u201dChen Xi\u2019s heart constricted and he hurriedly pushed open the chamber door and walked in.At the moment he entered, six incomparably enormous white jade racks entered his eyes, and they were labeled at the top in order of yellow-rank, profound-rank, earth-rank, heaven-rank, immortal artifact, and rare items. Obviously, these six enormous white jade racks were precisely the place the immortal, Nether Enlightenment, used to store his treasures.However\u2026At this moment, the six white jade racks were instead completely empty!\u201cWhy is it like this?\u201d Chen Xi hurriedly walked forward and his gaze swept past the white jade racks. Not to mention Magic Treasures, there wasn\u2019t even a hair on the racks, as it was squeaky clean.\u201cOh, now I remember. The treasures here ought to have been eaten by this Pixiu.\u201d Ji Yu was stunned as well, then he quickly recovered from his shock, then shook his head as he laughed. \u201cHow could I have forgotten? This little fellow loves to eat treasures and rare items. So long as it carried spirit energy with it, then no matter what it was, it would all be a delicacy in its mouth.\u201dChen Xi was instead unable to laugh and his gaze stared right at the Pixiu in Ji Yu\u2019s palm. He was truly unable to imagine how a body that was the size of a fist was actually able to eat treasures that filled an entire room! How could this be possible?Roar!The furry and snow white infant Pixiu that was like a little lion bared its fangs at Chen Xi as it roared twice, and it seemed to be demonstrating its might. But when coupled with its tender roar and pair of clear pitch black little eyes, it didn\u2019t seem ferocious but instead was extremely cute. If a girl were to see it, the girl would surely knead it into a ball in her arms.\u201cThen haven\u2019t we come here for nothing?\u201d Chen Xi muttered, and as he gazed at the empty white jade rack that was labeled with \u2018immortal artifact.\u2019 He really wished for nothing more than to choke the Pixiu to death.Immortal Artifacts!Just these two words caused his blood to boil, but it just so happened that he\u2019d missed the opportunity to possess one\u2026\u201cHow could this be considered as coming here for nothing? I think your gains are already great enough. Look properly, this is a Pixiu!\u201d Ji Yu was extremely puzzled, and he said, \u201cEven if you have over 10,000 immortal artifacts, it would still be unable to compare with a Pixiu!\u201dChen Xi looked at Ji Yu\u2019s serious and solemn expression and gaped, and he could only forcefully swallow his belly full of grievance.\u201cSenior Ji Yu, let\u2019s go to the Book Reserve.\u201dChen Xi turned around to walk out of the chamber, and he still felt extreme regret in his heart as he said inwardly, If it\u2019s eaten then it\u2019s eaten, there shouldn\u2019t be any divine beast that likes to eat those cultivation techniques, right?\u2026Step! Step! Step!A wave of constant footsteps resounded.Not long after Chen Xi left, a young man in royal blue clothing excitedly pushed open the chamber door and walked in.\u201cEh!\u201d When he saw the \u2018immortal artifact\u2019 and other labels on the six white jade racks, his expression suddenly became excited, and his breathing became hurried as well. However, when his gaze descended onto the completely empty racks, his face instantly froze, and his body started to tremble involuntarily as a mouthful of fresh blood surged out of his throat.\u201cAh! Ah! Ah! God dammit! Everything from yellow-rank Magic Treasures to Immortal Artifacts were here, yet someone beat me to the punch and wiped it squeaky clean\u2026 Motherfucker! It\u2019s fine if you take the larger portion, but you don\u2019t even leave scraps for others?\u201dThe lips of the blue clothed young man trembled as he emitted a sharp howl full of grief, and his voice was so loud that it spread throughout the entire Treasure Hall\u2019s corridors.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!In next to no time, numerous figures appeared within this chamber, and as they gazed at the six completely empty white jade racks, they knew that someone had beaten them to the punch. Their expressions became extremely unsightly.\u201cBloody hell! If I find out who did this, I\u2019ll definitely skin him alive!\u201d\u201cLook at the words, Immortal Artifacts were stored on that white jade rack! It was actually swept clean by someone, he\u2026 he\u2026 We\u2019re all fellow daoists, how could he have been so selfish?\u201d\u201cTruly going too far. He doesn\u2019t even know the rules of the cultivation world. He\u2019s too god damn virtueless!\u201d\u2026These young men and women were the young geniuses from the great powers of Dragon Lake City and were existences like favored geniuses of the gods. Normally, they were extremely arrogant and haughty, and they\u2019d entered the sword immortal\u2019s abode this time while carrying extremely large hopes.However, at this moment, as they gazed upon the completely empty surroundings, they recalled how they\u2019d been exhausted to death all the way here and took such a huge risk coming here, yet didn\u2019t get anything. They didn\u2019t care about bearing any longer as they burst out all at once, insulting that fellow who greedily emptied out the entire room and left nothing behind.\u201cDid all of you not find any treasures within the other chambers?\u201d Su Jiao expression was extremely unsightly, as she\u2019d searched over 100 chambers earlier but actually didn\u2019t find a single treasure.\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cExactly!\u201dThe others were stunned, then they repeatedly nodded as they agreed with what the others said before them.Su Jiao was extremely furious as she stared fixedly at the six completely empty white jade racks and said, \u201cLooks like this is the true place that treasures are stored within the Treasure Hall, but it just so happened that someone has beat us to the punch. Truly detestable!\u201d\u201cIs it Du Qingxi\u2019s group?\u201d Cang Bin said suddenly, his face was pitch black like the bottom of a pan. Obviously, he was extremely aggrieved as well.\u201cImpossible, we arrived before them.\u201d Su Jiao shook her head in denial.\u201cThen\u2026 Is it those Violet Palace Realm cultivators that came from others places in the southern territory?\u201d Cang Bin still clearly remembered that when they left Bloodbath City, his group wasn\u2019t the first to have left.\u201cNever mind, let's not think about it for now. This place is only the Treasure Hall and we haven\u2019t gone to the other halls. Now that the Treasure Hall has already been completely robbed of everything it had, we can\u2019t allow others to take the treasures within the other halls.\u201dSu Jiao took a deep breath and forcefully restrained the rage in her heart before slowly saying, \u201cIf we\u2019re able to hurry over in time, we even might be able to find that fellow that robbed the Treasure Hall of everything!\u201dThe others awoke from their rage when they heard this, and they understood that what Su Jiao said was indeed the most important matter right now. Immediately, all of them carried their bellyful of grievance as they dashed out of the Treasure Hall under Su Jiao\u2019s lead.They desperately urged their True Essence and didn\u2019t stop a moment on the way at all.Just you wait, kid. This Young Master\u2019s things aren't so easily taken!God damn it! If I catch this kid, I\u2019ll surely skin him alive, inch by inch!This fellow is too cruel! I wonder if this fellow is a man or a woman. If he\u2019s a man, then if the Dao Companion this Young Miss has in the future is of similar virtue to him, I\u2019ll fucking kill him!\u2026After a quarter of an hour.Su Jiao led the others out of a hall with a gloomy expression.\u201cWhat a rubbish Martial Dao Hall! There were just a few rocks in there, it was even inferior to my Azuresun Sect\u2019s training grounds\u2026\u201d One of them couldn\u2019t refrain from saying angrily.Su Jiao couldn\u2019t endure it any longer and snapped. \u201cShut up!\u201dAt this moment, she was truly unable to control her feelings any longer. They went to the Treasure Hall, but someone had beaten them to the punch and cleaned it out. They\u2019d come to the Martial Dao Hall, but there were only some lousy rocks used for cultivating sword techniques. Not mentioning having gone these places for nothing, they\u2019d also wasted a huge amount of time. How could she be able to endure the rage in her heart when she thought of the possibility that others might be dividing up the treasures within the other halls right now?\u201cLet\u2019s go! We\u2019ll go to the other hall. Even if all the treasures have been obtained by others, we\u2019ll seize it from them!\u201d Killing intent openly raged within Su Jiao\u2019s voice.The others all revealed fierce gazes when they saw this and they followed behind Su Jiao to violently dash forward. The strengths of these people were fairly outstanding in the first place, coupled with the flames of rage that broke out within their chests, it was only a short moment before they\u2019d already arrived before another hall.\u201cBook Reserve Hall? Dammit, someone has gone in!\u201d Su Jiao\u2019s eyes lit up, but her face couldn\u2019t help but go cold when she saw the half open door, and she said word for word, \u201cLooks like we really have to kill others and seize the treasures.\u201d\u201cGod damn it! I\u2019ve been wanting to kill someone since a long time ago!\u201d\u201cI was waiting for you to say this, this Young Master is about to die from grievance.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dEveryone had a bellyful of grievance and practically didn\u2019t need to be notified as they impatiently charged into the hall with raging killing intent, and their appearances seemed like bandits that wished for nothing more than to kill people and rob them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Forces GatherPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53 - Forces GatherBook Reserve HallContrary to the layout of the Treasure Hall, there weren\u2019t any chambers, and at the instant one entered the hall, it was an enormous space that covered an area of 3,000 meters.Rows upon rows of 30m tall bookshelves could be found all over. They stood layer upon layer to occupy every space within the entire hall. If one were to look down from a high vantage point, one would be able to see that these rows of bookshelves formed an octagonal shape, and were like orderly layers of a blossoming flower bud.Walking within it was like walking into a winding maze. Everywhere one\u2019s gaze passed was filled bookshelves that were densely piled with jade slips, and one was unable to discern any direction.At this moment, Chen Xi had stopped before a bookshelf, as he\u2019d walked along the hall and gone around all the bookshelves.\u201cTalisman crafting, puppeteering, taming, botany, divine abilities, techniques\u2026 This Book Reserve Hall actually covers and contains everything!\u201d Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in surprise.Nearby, Ji Yu put down a jade slip in his hand and shook his head. \u201cA huge number doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s rare and valuable. According to what I\u2019ve seen, most of the jade slips are all ordinary.\u201dChen Xi didn\u2019t argue, as he knew that Ji Yu was extremely picky, and Ji Yu holding these jade slips in contempt was within reason. Moreover, these jade slips were extremely precious to Chen Xi.He was impoverished since a young age. When he\u2019d gone to Pine Mist City\u2019s Exquisite Pavilion to purchase the martial techniques he\u2019d required, he was actually ridiculed by the female attendant. If it wasn\u2019t for the Little Princess of the General\u2019s Estate, Qin Hongmian, stepping forward, he could only swallow the insult and humiliation silently, then leave in dejection.So, at this moment, he\u2019d already decided inwardly that even if he didn\u2019t cultivate it, he would still take away these jade slips that were practically as vast as the ocean. Exchanging them for spirit stones would still be an enormous sum of wealth!However, right at this moment, a wave of footsteps suddenly sounded out from outside the hall.Chen Xi was shocked inwardly. At this moment, it was already impossible for him to plunder all these jade slips, but he was extremely reluctant to miss the opportunity to obtain so many jade slips.\u201cI\u2019ve helped you picked sword techniques, divine abilities, and movement techniques. What else do you lack?\u201d As he spoke, Ji Yu extended his hand out and successively swept it through the air, and numerous jade slips flew over to him as if they\u2019d grown wings.Chen Xi was stunned, then asked. \u201cCan we take them all?\u201dJi Yu\u2019s face sank and he stopped what he was doing.Chen Xi cursed inwardly. He\u2019d been together with Ji Yu for a long time and understood Ji Yu\u2019s character extremely well. Ji Yu could devote himself to guide Chen Xi\u2019s cultivation, but if Chen Xi were to ask him to do something he wasn\u2019t willing to do, then it would absolutely not be possible.According to what Ji Yu said, only when Chen Xi had passed all the trials within the Heavenpeak of Trials to become the personal disciple of the Master of the Manner would Chen Xi be able to order him around.At this moment, when he saw Ji Yu was displeased, Chen Xi apologized right away. \u201cSenior Ji Yu I\u2019m sorry, it was junior that was too greedy. If I\u2019m able to choose, then I hope to obtain some talisman crafting jade slips.\u201dChen Xi knew that so long as he spoke of things related to talisman crafting, Ji Yu would surely be extremely happy. Because his Master, Senior Fuxi, had precisely observed the River Diagram to deduce the profound meaning behind the cycle of the secrets of the heavens to gain sudden comprehension the Grand Dao and ascend to the peak of the Dao.Whereas it was precisely because he himself had comprehension in the Dao of Talismans that he was able to walk out of the Star Secret Realm and obtain Ji Yu\u2019s acknowledgment.As expected, Ji Yu\u2019s expression instantly eased up significantly when he heard that Chen Xi was still constantly thinking of the Dao of Talismans. Ji Yu snorted coldly before extending his hand out to sweep through the air, and 10 plus jade slips once again shot out towards him.13 talisman crafting jade slips, coupled with the jade slips related to sword techniques, movement techniques, and divine abilities, I already possess 20 jade slips. Although it\u2019s only a speck in the vast ocean that is the Book Reserve Hall, jade slips that were able to be picked by Senior Ji Yu ought to be gems within this sea.Chen Xi casually stored the jade slips within his storage ring, then followed behind Ji Yu to dash off the way he came in.The sound of footsteps grew closer and closer, and it was vaguely mixed with the clamorous sounds of people. All the cultivators that were able to enter the hall were at the Violet Palace Realm and had formed groups before coming; the large gap in their strengths and numbers caused Chen Xi to not dare stay on any longer. Moreover, for the sake of preventing his tracks from being noticed, he didn\u2019t even touch the numerous jade slips on the nearby bookshelves as he was afraid others would notice something from the traces left behind.Different to how the others entered the hall via the main door, Chen Xi had entered through a concealed little passageway from the Main Hall. If one didn\u2019t search carefully, it would be extremely difficult to notice this passageway, so, he didn\u2019t encounter a single cultivator all through his return journey.\u201cHahaha! Book Reserve Hall! The Book Reserve Hall the immortal, Nether Enlightenment, left behind!\u201d Hoarse and shrill laughter suddenly resounded out within the hall. \u201cThe jade slips on these rows of bookshelves are probably at least a few tens of thousands and have been covered in dust for 10,000 years. Now it will instead benefit us. It\u2019s truly an extremely great good fortune.\u201dChen Xi stood before a far away concealed door and couldn\u2019t help but shake his head when he heard this voice, and he was just about to step into the concealed door and leave when he suddenly heard a familiar voice sound out, causing him to stop dead in his tracks.\u201cFellow Daoists of the Phoenixcloud Sect, aren\u2019t you getting excited too soon?\u201d The voice was hearty and warm, but when it entered Chen Xi\u2019s ears, it instead caused killing intent to surge within his heart.Even if he\u2019d turned to ash, Chen Xi would still recognize the owner of this voice.As he recalled being stabbed in the back by this fellow in the Crimsonflame Mountain Range which caused him to fall down the deep chasm, the hatred in Chen Xi\u2019s heart uncontrollably surged, and his expression went extremely icy cold.\u201cSenior Ji Yu, I\u2019ve decided to stay back.\u201d Chen Xi took a deep breath and sent a voice transmission with a deep voice.Ji Yu glanced at Chen Xi and said indifferently, \u201cTake care of your enemy yourself. I won't help you even if you\u2019re killed by him.\u201dChen Xi nodded, only by killing his enemy with his own two hands would he be able to vent the roiling hatred in his heart.Whoosh!Chen Xi glanced at the surroundings, then his body arched as the tip of his feet lightly tapped the floor and he nimbly scurried up the stone beam in the corner like a silent leopard cat. This stone beam was three meters wide and was arranged in a crisscross pattern with tens of stone beams, like a large net that ran through the top of the entire hall, and he didn\u2019t have to worry about being discovered when hiding here.Moreover, he was able to see the scene within the entire hall from this position. According to Chen Xi\u2019s conjecture, those Phoenixcloud Sect cultivators would surely initiate a battle with Chai Letian\u2019s group for the sake of competing for the jade slips within the hall. In this way, he would be completely able to hide here and pick the best opportunity to launch a sneak attack on Chai Letian!Violet Palace Realm cultivators already possessed Perception Force, moreover, their six senses were acute and were extremely sensitive to their surroundings. Chen Xi didn\u2019t dare utilize his Perception Force. He restrained the aura on his entire body then lay flat on the stone beam, like a wisp of a black silhouette. At the same time, his eyes narrowed into slits as he carefully gazed at the hall below.At this moment, two groups of cultivators had already gathered within the hall.One group was the group of cultivators led by Chai Letian, with Chen Xi\u2019s acquaintances like Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, Song Lin\u2026Whereas, on the opposite side was a few unfamiliar cultivators who wore varied clothing and were of various ages. The four people in the lead were extremely conspicuous, a gaunt old man, a stalwart middle aged man, a young man and a young woman. The four of them wore similar crimson-purple robes with exquisite patterns of a fire phoenix dancing in the air while surrounded by clouds. They were shockingly those Phoenixcloud Sect cultivators that Chen Xi had seen within Bloodbath City.At the moment, the two groups had already taken out their Magic Treasures and weapons and were in confrontation on the space in the middle of the bookshelves, ready to fight.The gaunt old man from Phoenixcloud Sect said coldly, \u201cHmph! Even though all of you are disciples that are from the various great powers of Dragon Lake City and have extraordinary status, but I\u2019m sorry, for the sake of the jade slips here, asking us to leave is absolutely impossible. Not only would I, Fu Heng, not agree, the fellow daoists behind me would absolutely not agree as well!\u201d\u201cRight, we\u2019ll absolutely not agree.\u201d\u201cWant us to leave on our own? No chance!\u201dAll the other cultivators behind the gaunt old man echoed his views, yet their expressions weren\u2019t relaxed. Obviously, Chai Letian\u2019s group brought quite an amount of pressure to them.\u201cWhy torture yourselves? If you offend us, then would your small sects be able to live on happily after this?\u201d Chai Letian said unhurriedly, \u201cCould it be that all of you aren\u2019t worried that the sects all of you represent will be pulled up from the roots and completely annihilated?\u201d\u201cI advise all of you to leave quickly. Brother Chai\u2019s ancestor is one of the great Nether Transformation Realm cultivators of the southern territory. Dealing with all of you would only be a matter of giving the order.\u201d The Myriadcloud Institution\u2019s Yu Haobai shook his head and sighed. He seemed elegant and refined, yet his tone was filled with the intent to curry favor with Chai Letian.The gaunt Fu Heng\u2019s expression flickered between a pale and grim expression, and he was violently struggling within his heart. Whereas behind him, the expressions of those cultivators from various cities in the southern territory had mostly become quite gloomy.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but become anxious when he saw Fu Heng and the other\u2019s will to fight was fading. If Fu Heng\u2019s group fled before a battle, then his plans to sneak attack Chen Letian would come to naught.\u201cHmph! According to my knowledge, the great Nether Transformation Realm cultivator, Senior Chai Shao, isn\u2019t a person that\u2019s unreasonable. Not to mention that this sword immortal\u2019s abode is derelict and the jade slips here belong to whomever who gets it. Aren\u2019t you going too far by asking us to leave with just a word?\u201dFu Heng gritted his teeth. \u201cIn my opinion, why don\u2019t we do it like this? If Fellow Daoist Chai agrees, then my group will take 40% of the jade slips here, and the remaining 60% belongs to your group, how about it?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely impossible!\u201d Chai Letian refused right away and sneered coldly. \u201cWant to take things from me? You aren\u2019t worthy! I\u2019ll give you another ten breaths of time, hurry up and fuck off from this hall. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame us for being merciless!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Fu Heng\u2019s eyes were wide open with exasperation, and he was actually angered to the point he was unable to speak.\u201cHmph! You dare come here and try taking things from me with this level of courage? Hurry up! Five breaths of time have already passed.\u201d Chai Letian shook his head in disdain.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be speechless as he gazed at Fu Heng\u2019s group who didn\u2019t dare do anything and were silently swallowing the insult and humiliation.\u201cHmph! I was wondering who it was, so it turned out to be Fellow Daoist Chai from Starnet Palace!\u201d It was at this moment that a delicate voice of a woman slowly echoed out within the hall.Chen Xi gazed over and couldn\u2019t refrain from saying inwardly,Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - Playing TricksPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54 - Playing TricksAlong with the entrance of Su Jiao\u2019s group into the Book Reserve Hall, the confrontational atmosphere became even more strained.As they gazed at the two groups of people who were in conflict, Su Jiao and the group behind her had incomparably gloomy expressions with gazes filled with undisguised killing intent.The Pheonixcloud Sect\u2019s Fu Heng gasped inwardly. At this moment, the development of the situation had already exceeded his expectations, but the only thing that made him feel relieved was that due to the entrance of Su Jiao\u2019s group, even if Chai Letian\u2019s group wanted to make a move against him, they would surely have scruples.The expressions of Chai Letian and the people behind him all went serious when they saw Su Jiao\u2019s group and they lost their earlier expressions of having victory within their grasps.At this moment, a shocking three way had formed within the hall, three powers each taking a corner and restraining each other, and a slight movement may affect the situation as a whole. Under these circumstances, no one dared make a rash move.\u201cMiss Su, the Book Reserve Hall has already been occupied by us now. All of you better not interfere here and harm the good relationship between each other, that wouldn\u2019t be a good sight to behold.\u201d Chai Letian said coldly.Su Jiao who had a bellyful of rage from coming out empty handed from the Treasure Hall and Martial Dao Hall couldn\u2019t help but sneer when she saw Chai Letian wanting to drive her off the moment he spoke. \u201cCut the crap, that old freak from your clan can\u2019t scare me.\u201d\u201cAudacious!\u201d Yu Haobai behind Chai Letian shouted out explosively. \u201cSenior Chai Shao is one of the few remaining Nether Transformation Realm cultivators within the southern territory, and you actually dare insult him as an old freak? You really have no idea of death or danger!\u201d\u201cHmph! Cut the crap! Isn\u2019t it just comparing ancestors?\u201dCang Bin who was beside Su Jiao sneered silently, then said, \u201cChai Letian has a Nether Transformation Realm ancestor backing him, but Miss Su\u2019s elder brother Su Chan has already become the only closed door disciple of the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect\u2019s Rebirth Realm sword cultivator, Ancestor Ling Du in a thousand years. Do you think that what you said has any meaning now?\u201dAll the people present including Chai Letian seemed as if they\u2019d heard an extremely terrifying thing, and their faces went pale in unison.Atop a concealed corner on the far away stone beams that were extremely high up, Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be shocked. If one were to speak in terms of the most formidable, then amongst the powers of Dragon Lake City, the Wanderingcloud Sword Sect would take the top without a doubt.Allegedly, there were quite many formidable Earthly Immortal Realm sword cultivators living in seclusion within Wanderingcloud Sword Sect!Ancestor Ling Du was precisely a well-renowned Rebirth Realm sword cultivator within Wanderingcloud Sword Sect. His temper was explosive and slaughtered cruelly, and his reputation was extremely resounding within the entire southern territory\u2019s cultivation world and could be said to be known by all.\u201cHmph! No wonder you\u2019re so confident. So it turned out lucky bastard, Su Chan, has become a disciple of Ancestor Ling Du.\u201d Chai Letian\u2019s expression quickly returned to normal, then he shook his head and said in disdain, \u201cSu Chan is Su Chan, you Su Jiao are Su Jiao. Do you think Ancestor Ling Du would offend the ancestor of my clan for your sake?\u201dSu Jiao\u2019s expression remained unfazed, yet she sighed inwardly, Chai Letian was correct indeed. She wasn\u2019t directly related to Ancestor Ling Du after all and it was merely able to allow her to put on some tiger skin. It was absolutely impossible for her to get Ancestor Ling Du to offend a Nether Transformation Realm cultivator which was a Realm higher than himself for her sake.However, Su Jiao was absolutely not a simple person, and her eyes balls revolved and she\u2019d already thought of a plan. She paid no attention to Chai Letian and instead shot her gaze as Fu Heng and the others before saying with a smile, \u201cI presume all of you are unwilling to enter the Book Reserve Hall but leave empty handed, right? How about we join forces and kill all of them? We\u2019ll share all the jade slips within this hall equally, how about it?\u201dFu Heng had never expected that Su Jiao would put forward such a suggestion, and he was stunned briefly before saying, \u201cBut\u2026\u201dSu Jiao interrupted. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about anything else. This is the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain after all. So long as we don\u2019t speak of it, then no one will know who\u2019d killed anyone within this place.\u201dFu Heng\u2019s gaze burned with desire as he\u2019d obviously been moved by Su Jiao\u2019s words.Su Jiao\u2019s suggestion was indeed vicious and effective. Chai Letian\u2019s group only consisted of eight Violet Palace Realm cultivators and weren\u2019t able to compare with any of the other two groups. If they were to be attacked by the joint forces of these two groups, the two groups were indeed capable of completely annihilating Chai Letian\u2019s group.\u201cFellow Daoist Fu, if you dare do this, then you\u2019ll surely regret it!\u201d Chai Letian was eventually unable to maintain his composure, and his face abruptly went grim as he shouted, \u201cCould it be that you\u2019re not afraid that Su Jiao would burn the bridge after crossing it and kill all of you, then take possession of all the jade slips within this hall?\u201dFu Heng was stunned and his expression once again became indecisive. Obviously, he was worried that Su Jiao would do this as well.\u201cHow about all of you work together with me, we\u2019ll annihilate Su Jiao\u2019s groups. We\u2019ll split these jade slips according to what you said earlier, how about a four to six split?\u201d Chai Letian inwardly heaved a sigh of relief and struck while the iron was hot.Fu Heng was in an extremely difficult position.He\u2019d completely never imagined that his group which was originally the weakest had become a hot cake that both of the other two groups had to fight for. It just so happened that for the sake of guarding against the others burning the bridge after crossing it, he couldn\u2019t agree to either of the two groups.When faced with such a situation, Fu Heng and the others behind him were all in a difficult situation between the two groups.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but become inwardly anxious when he saw the three groups of people not getting into battle for a long time, then a flash of inspiration flashed within his mind as he suddenly thought of an excellent plan.\u2014\u2014Time trickled by, yet the atmosphere was more and more oppressive. The groups were unable to start a fight, nor were they able to split up the jade slips within the hall, and they could only stand by anxiously and waste time.\u201cIn my opinion, our three groups shouldn\u2019t contend with each other any longer. How about we discuss a way to share all these jade slips?\u201d Chai Letian was finally impatient from waiting and he put forward his suggestion with reluctance in his heart.\u201cAlright, we agree if this is possible.\u201d Su Jiao inwardly heaved a sigh of relief. She was afraid they\u2019d continue wasting time like and another person would interfere into the matter, then the situation would be even more chaotic.\u201cThe suggestion of Fellow Daoist Chai is indeed what we\u2019re anxiously looking forward to.\u201d Fu Heng let out a long sigh as well. Comparatively speaking, his group of was the weakest and possessed the strongest pressure, so he was naturally unwilling to get into a fight with the other two groups.However, right at this moment, an unexpected voice abruptly resounded within the hall.\u201cBrother Chai, things aren\u2019t going well. Those people from the Phoenixcloud Sect are actually gathering precious jade slips as well!\u201dEveryone present was stunned when they heard this.When this voice entered the ears of Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin, their hearts suddenly shook and their faces were filled with disbelief.Chai Letian was stunned, then he figured it out and his face instantly went black like the bottom of a pan.Su Jiao had discerned who the owner of the voice was and her gaze swept towards behind Chai Letian. As expected, she didn\u2019t notice a trace of Chen Xi. When she recalled the information revealed from what Chen Xi said, her face instantly when extremely icy cold and she started laughing out of extreme rage, then said word for word. \u201cYou, Chai Letian, deserve to be called scheming and calculating. You first send people to gather the precious jade slips, then put forward the suggestion to share the jade slips within the hall equally, leaving those trash jade slips to us\u2026 You\u2019re truly going too far!\u201d\u201cMiss Su, listen to me. Chen Xi is deceiving all of you, he hasn\u2019t been one of us for a long time now\u2026\u201d Chai Letian hurriedly explained.\u201cIt has already come to this and you still want to give excuses? Did you think I didn\u2019t notice Chen Xi following all of you since he left Bloodbath City?\u201dClang!As she spoke, a flying sword that was fiery red as if it was ablaze suddenly appeared in Su Jiao\u2019s hand, and her expression was livid. \u201cLooks like we can only resolve this through battle. Everyone, we\u2019ve been played by these damnable bastards! Kill these two faced despicable people!\u201dClang! Clang! Clang!Cang Bin and the others recovered from their shock and the grievances accumulated from the Treasure Hall and Martial Dao Hall mixed with the rage from being deceived exploded out now with a bang. They all drew their weapons and gritted their teeth as they charged to attack Chai Letian\u2019s group.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Chai Letian was enraged to the point his body trembled. He wanted to explain but before he could even finish what he wanted to say, he saw various Magic Treasures with threatening glows of spirit energy covering the entire heaven and earth as they smashed towards him. He didn\u2019t dare hesitate as he drew out a Magic Treasure with a flick of his hand and moved to intercept the attacks.The others behind Chai Letian were incomparably aggrieved as well, but when they saw Su Jiao\u2019s group attacking without distinguishing between black and white, they became enraged as well. Instantly, their faces went gloomy as they drew their personal Magic Treasures and entered the fray.\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cKill them!\u201d\u201cDammit!\u201dSu Jiao\u2019s group of 13 and Chai Letian\u2019s group of 8 were all Violet Palace Realm cultivators. At this moment, when they each executed the skills they were adept in, True Essence shook and roared within the hall. A terrifying stream of air was like a sharp saber as it swept through the surroundings, leaving behind shocking cracks on the walls of the hall.There was an enormous blood-red sword that transformed into a flood dragon as it soared in the sky, biting and roaring.There were over 100 flying swords with dense cold lights that were weaved together to form a sword formation which emitted billowing killing intent.There were roiling black torrents that surged out from within a spirit streamer, rumbling as it charged towards its enemies.\u2026All sorts of Magic Treasures, absolutely ingenious combat measures, and various lights that were disorderly and gorgeous yet filled with a terrifying aura\u2026 The destruction caused by all of these colliding with each other seemed to tear space into pieces.The terrifying stream of air caused by the chaotic battle surged towards the surroundings and instantly blasted all the bookshelves in the hall onto the ground, destroying them into pieces. Whereas those jade slips that rolled all over the floor like mercury were pulverized into powder before transforming into ash that disappeared with the wind.The wages for avarice was death!It just so happened that at this moment, no one cared about the jade slips within the hall as they\u2019d all gone berserk from the slaughter. They exerted all the might within their bodies as they roared and shouted, wishing for nothing more than to make their opponent die a miserable death in their hands. For a time, the scene seemed to be incomparably horrifying, like a living hell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Hundred Herb HallPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55 - Hundred Herb Hall\u201cHey! Old dog, want to flee after you sent people to gather all the precious jade slips? Don\u2019t you dare move!\u201dCang Bin shouted out explosively, and the Redlotus Bloodsoul sword in his hand danced about, transforming into an enormous blood colored waterfall that cleaved straight towards Fu Heng.Fu Heng was already angered to the point that his gaunt face trembled after he swung his hand to draw out a glowing glazed colored shield made of feathers to block the enormous blood colored sword that was heading towards him.He didn\u2019t know Chen Xi, but when Chen Xi said the words Phoenixcloud Sect earlier, it caused him to instantly become like a rat on the streets, chased by all with the intent to kill. Regardless of whether it was Su Jiao\u2019s or Chai Letian\u2019s groups, they\u2019d all taken him to be a despicable person who\u2019d stolen the precious jade slips and they attacked him viciously and mercilessly, forcing him to the point he was nearly unable to withstand the attacks.Clang! Clang! Clang!The Redlotus Bloodsoul Sword was like a sledgehammer under the control of Cang Bin\u2019s fierce and raging energy as it repeatedly smashed onto the Glazed Feather Shield. The terrifying force from the sword smashed onto Fu Heng to the point his entire body trembled unceasingly. Then his face went pale; he couldn\u2019t restrain it any longer and spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.Fu Heng yelled and roared within his heart. Although he had never met Chen Xi before, he already hated Chen Xi to the bones for throwing him into such a trap.It wasn\u2019t just Fu Heng, all the people in his group suffered the same treatment, being chased around by Su Jiao and Chai Letian\u2019s group with an intent to kill. Whereas when they intended to counterattack, they instead noticed that Su Jiao\u2019s group and Chai Letian\u2019s group had already lumped together in battle. This sort of utterly chaotic situation almost caused them to be unable to figure out who exactly was the enemy!Tears covered the faces of Fu Heng\u2019s group who suffered an undeserved calamity.\u2026Outside the Book Reserve Hall.After yelling out earlier, Chen Xi didn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest and dashed out of the Book Reserve Hall from the concealed passageway. At this moment, a trace of guilt couldn\u2019t help but rise in his heart as he heard the waves of terrifying sounds of battle echoing out from within the hall, as he felt he\u2019d wronged Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin.Since entering the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain and up to the point they entered the Crimsonflame Mountain Range, the three of them had taken good care of him and had taken him to be a friend. Whereas now, because of something he\u2019d said, they\u2019d fallen into chaotic battle, and this caused Chen Xi to feel slightly sorry.Chen Xi shook his head after silently pondering for a short moment, then he put away his thoughts before leaping out to dash towards the concealed little passageway that headed to the Hundred Herb Hall.According to his deduction, the battle within the Book Reserve Hall would surely continue for some time before a victor could be decided. He was completely capable of seizing the opportunity when the three groups were in a chaotic battle to clean out the Hundred Herb Hall.Not long after, Chen Xi stepped foot into the Hundred Herb Hall.The moment he stepped into the Hundred Herb Hall, the spirit energy that was suffused in the air had actually condensed into numerous masses of mist, and when breathed in, the pure and copious amounts of spirit energy flowed through his entire body, causing Chen Xi\u2019s spirit to be refreshed.As Chen Xi breathed in the copious spirit energy in the air that contained traces of the delicate fragrances of grass and trees, his eyes were extremely bright.Chen Xi didn\u2019t hesitate and started searching through the entire Hundred Herb Hall.The Hundred Herb Hall covered an area of an 500 km and was a hundred times larger than the Treasure Hall and Book Reserve Hall. After spending nearly an eighth of an hour, Chen Xi finally found the location of the spirit farmland, and he couldn\u2019t help but secretly heave a sigh of relief.This was a spirit farmland that was an entire 7 plus hectares large, and numerous mist clouds drifted above it. The mist clouds were like cotton and emitted an enchanting luster. Chen Xi shockingly noticed after sizing it up, that these mist clouds were actually all condensed from spirit energy!However, when his gaze descended onto the spirit farmland, he couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.Atop the jet-black and glossy soil was a barren land. Some spirit plants could be vaguely seen atop the spirit farmland, but they were dead and had withered for god knew how long. As he gazed from afar, there was actually not a single spirit plant that was alive.Chen Xi frowned and walked into the spirit farmland, and he swiftly flashed all the way to dash to the depths of the spirit farmland.Gush! Gush!After dashing for nearly 50km, Chen Xi suddenly heard an extremely faint sound of water flowing, and he\u2019d noticed at this moment as well that along with him going deeper into the spirit farmland, the nearby spirit energy had become even more copious.Chen Xi dashed another tens of kilometers towards the sound of water before seeing a spring gurgling out. The spring water was pure and flawless like milk, and it emitted a shocking amount of spirit energy.Chen Xi practically recognized what the spring was with a single glance, and he couldn\u2019t help but gasp.Most of the great powers in the world possessed their own prosperous grounds that accumulated spirit energy, and they were superb locations for cultivating. The reason the spirit energy within these prosperous grounds was abundant was the existence of spirit veins.Spirit veins were divided into various grades according to their quality, but a spirit spring that was covered by countless cultivators would only appear nearby a top-grade spirit vein!This was because the springs that flowed out from a spirit spring were all spirit liquids that were condensed from spirit energy. After cultivators advanced to the Violet Palace Realm, spirit stones and spirit crystals were useless to them and they had to use spirit liquids to cultivate.However, for an ordinary cultivator, it wasn\u2019t such an easy thing to obtain spirit liquids. Unless one became a disciple of a great sect or clan, otherwise, one could only produce an enormous amount of spirit stones and spirit crystals to purchase spirit liquids or use treasures to exchange for spirit liquids. This was also precisely the reason why spirit liquids were precious.Chen Xi took a deep breath and moved his gaze away from the spirit spring with great difficulty, and only now did he see clearly that a delicate and beautiful lotus that glowed in a misty golden light was shockingly growing on the spirit farmland nearby the spirit spring. Under the cover of the dense mist of spirit energy, it was truly difficult to notice if he didn\u2019t look carefully.This lotus wasn\u2019t large and was only 65cm tall. Its stem was dazzling like gold with dense striations on its upper portion and glowed with a metallic luster. Every layer of the delicate and beautiful golden lotus petals were fully bloomed, and it contained a myriad of stamens and pistils that were like strands of golden needles linked together, a feast for the eyes. The entire lotus didn\u2019t have a trace of anything out of place. It was entirely perfect, causing one to have to praise the miracles of the god of creation.Chen Xi\u2019s gaze was attracted by a golden fruit that was covered at the center of the layers upon layers of flower petals, and strands of stamens and pistils. It was only the size of a goose egg and was completely round. Its surface was coiled by a layer of spirit energy flames, and a strand of sharp aura that seemed material surged out from it, causing it to seem extremely mystical.Chen Xi wracked his brains but couldn\u2019t figure out what this golden lotus actually was. But just from its outwards appearance, Chen Xi was able to determine that this thing was surely a spirit plant that was a precious treasure of the heavens and the earth!\u201cGoldsoul Divine Lotus!\u201d Ji Yu appeared out of thin air and cried out involuntarily when he gazed at the lotus.Howl!The infant Pixiu in Ji Yu\u2019s arms sniffed for a moment and its eyes lit up instantly, then it struggled, wanting to pounce towards the lotus but was pressed down by Ji Yu\u2019s large hands, causing the little fellow to bare his fangs and howl unceasingly.\u201cSenior, what\u2019s a Goldsoul Divine Lotus?\u201dChen Xi hurriedly stood before the lotus as he spoke, then gazed at the infant Pixiu vigilantly. As soon as he recalled that all the treasures within the Treasure Hall were eaten clean by this little fellow, he felt extremely pained.\u201cThis lotus is a goldsoul treasure that was born from the five elements of nature and innately possesses a pure goldsoul body. Even in the primordial era, it\u2019s an extremely rare treasure. This Goldsoul Divine Lotus was born from the metal element of nature and based on its condition, it\u2019s obviously already in the phase of maturity.\u201dJi Yu had a burning gaze, and he couldn\u2019t help but reveal a slightly envious and astonished expression as he said, \u201cThe Goldsoul Divine Lotus sprouts after 10 years, becomes a lotus in 100 years, blooms in 1,000 years, and would only bear a lotus fruit after being nurtured for 5,000 years. After that, it would grow larger by a circle every 1,000 years until it\u2019s like the size of an infant\u2019s fist. If it isn\u2019t picked in time, it would fall to the ground and transform back into spirit energy, vanishing within the five elements of the three dimensions.\u201dChen Xi lowered his head and measured it for a moment. The Goldsoul Divine Lotus before him just happened to be the size of an infant\u2019s fist, and it was precisely just about to reach maturity!\u201cThis is too much of a coincidence, right?\u201d Chen Xi was astonished to the point he didn\u2019t know how to express himself, he felt the joyous feeling of something falling into his lap.Ji Yu felt it was unbelievable as well, but when he saw the Pixiu in his arms, he experienced a flash of enlightenment in his heart and said with a weird expression, \u201cWhen fortune has arrived, it can\u2019t be stopped.\u201d\u201cWho said it can\u2019t be stopped?\u201d It was at this moment that an icy voice suddenly sounded out, then the dense mist far away behind Chen Xi abruptly started roiling, and four or five figures could be vaguely seen to be flashing over here explosively.\u201cShit! All my attention was actually caught by a single Goldsoul Divine Lotus, it really shouldn\u2019t have happened. I\u2019ll leave the rest to you. I can only tell you that if the Goldsoul Divine Lotus is seized away by another, then you\u2019ll regret it for your entire lifetime.\u201d Ji Yu was stunned, then shook his head as he instructed Chen Xi before vanishing into thin air.\u201cChen Xi, long time no see.\u201d Within the roiling mist, a tall figure appeared before Chen Xi. He had sword shaped eyebrows and starry eyes, with shoulder length long hair, and he looked at Chen Xi with a gaze filled with boundless hatred.Chen Xi was startled, he never imagined that he would encounter this fellow here, but he still heaved a sigh of relief inwardly when he found out he was facing an opponent he\u2019d already defeated before.Three young men with respectful expressions followed behind Li Huai, they all had large foreheads and cold lights within their eyes, but when Chen Xi saw them, he instantly determined that these three people hadn\u2019t advanced to the Violet Palace Realm and at most had a cultivation at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm.\u201cThis is the Goldsoul Divine Lotus you spoke of? It\u2019s extraordinary as expected.\u201d Li Huai\u2019s gaze descended onto the Goldsoul Divine Lotus on the spirit farmland, and he emitted and undisguisable burning desire and greed.Chen Xi swiftly contemplated within his mind, and he\u2019d made his decision in an instant and killing intent immediately appeared within his eyes.\u201cWant to kill me? Haha! My cultivation isn\u2019t restrained anymore within this sword immortal\u2019s abode. Do you have any chance of winning when facing me at the Violet Palace Realm?\u201dLi Huai roared with laughter, and his voice revealed boundless resentment. Obviously, he\u2019d recalled the scene of being defeated by Chen Xi at Bloodbath City. \u201cOnce I kill you, I\u2019ll dedicate this Goldsoul Divine Lotus to Miss Su and using this as an opportunity, she\u2019ll surely agree to the marriage with me!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re about to die and you still have so much crap to spout.\u201d Chen Xi shook his head, and he gazed straight at Li Huai as billowing battle intent surged out from his chest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 - Kill!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56 - Kill!\u201cLi Song, Li Kuo, Li Hong, you three just watch from the side. I\u2019ll smash this kid into a pulp today!\u201d Li Huai waved his hand as he instructed the three nearby Li Clan disciples, then he held his Pine Ripple Sword in his hand, and his gaze was like lightning as his formidable aura locked onto Chen Xi.Chen Xi didn\u2019t continue speaking, the tip of his foot tapped the ground as his entire body was like an arrow that left the bow, flashing explosively towards Li Huai.Hiss! Hiss!As he dashed, his body actually tore numerous long waves of air in the surrounding air. These waves of air surged out and crackled like surging river water with extremely shocking force.After using the Netherezim Baleful Qi at the foundation of the formation in the bottom of the chasm to attain the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm in body refinement, Chen Xi\u2019s body was like a treasured sword that was tempered within a furnace for millions of times. His vital energy and blood shot into the sky like a rainbow, the bones and tendons within his body were refined like jade, and there wasn\u2019t a shred of impurities within his entire body. When he dashed out, his body was light like a swallow and combined with the Heavenly Dragon\u2019s Eight Steps, his speed was at least 20% faster than before!Bang!The sky shook as a fist that was covered in terrifying force smashed straight at Li Huai\u2019s face, it was exactly the same move that he used when fighting Li Huai outside Bloodbath City.\u201cThis move again\u2026 Hmph! You\u2019re underestimating me, Li Huai, too much!\u201d As he shouted, thick True Essence abruptly surged out from Li Huai\u2019s body, and his body lifted off the ground with a swish to fly up mid-air.Bang!His fist missed and the powerful True Essence blasted onto the spirit farmland like a plow as it smashed out numerous deep trenches, and dirt flew out into the surroundings.\u201cHaha! Violet Palace Realm cultivators can fly in the air, idiot!\u201d Li Huai laughed arrogantly in mid-air.Whereas seizing the opportunity when Li Huai was talking, Chen Xi didn\u2019t stop and instead charged towards the three nearby young men.Bang! Bang! Bang!One of the Li Clan disciples was caught off guard, his skull was directly shattered by a single punch, and he died on the spot. The other two of them crossed their arms in defense, but they were still unable to flee from this calamity, it was as if a 150,000kg sledgehammer had fiercely smashed onto their arms, causing their bones to be shattered into bits. The terrifying force that surged out from Chen Xi\u2019s fist shook the two of them to the point they fiercely spat out a mouthful of blood before flying out over 30m and were unable to get up anymore.The school of fiendgod body refinement had always been a terrifying existence that annihilated all qi refiners of the same cultivation. Now that Chen Xi\u2019s physique was refined to the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm, it was completely capable of being on par against an ordinary graded Magic Treasure, allowing him to possess a strength that was mighty and bones and tendons that were formidable. By just relying on the strength of his body, it was more than sufficient for him to slaughter these three Li Clan disciples that were only at the Congenital Realm.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d Li Huai\u2019s face suddenly went grim, he was in mid-air, yet the Pine Ripple Sword in his hand transformed into an azure light that fiercely slashed at Chen Xi, and it was precisely the ability to control Magic Treasures that only Violet Palace Realm cultivators were able to master.Whoosh!The Pine Ripple Sword was extremely swift like lightning, and the terrifying force of the sword even tore through the air, shaking the surrounding spirit energy to disperse with a bang.Chen Xi was shocked inwardly, unable to dodge in time, he swung out his fist to smash the flying sword that shot violently towards him. Unexpectedly, the flying sword suddenly changed directions mid-air and swept past an arc as it swiftly glided past his ribs.Psst!His clothes tore open and a faint bruise appeared on his body that was hard like cast iron, but even then, Chen Xi still couldn\u2019t help from sweating out cold sweat from shock.\u201cHow could it be possible!? This Pine Ripple Sword is a low-grade yellow-rank Magic Treasure, how could it be unable to injure this fellow?\u201d In mid-air, Li Huai was stunned, and his expression became unsightly.\u201cCome the fuck down!\u201d Even though he wasn\u2019t injured, but it still infuriated Chen Xi. His vast True Essence poured into his arms and they instantly smashed out a myriad of times, and transparent fists that seemed to be material shot out from his hands!These transparent fists seemed like they were carved from crystal and were glittering and translucent. They were condensed and compressed from True Essence then smashed out by Chen Xi\u2019s third level of the Grand Collapsing Fist \u2014 collapsing rocks into powder, and were like a meteor rain that whistled in the sky, emitting extremely shocking sounds and might.\u201cHmph! It\u2019s only True Essence discharge, it\u2019s unable to do anything to me!\u201d Li Huai sneered. A myriad of sharp sword lights suddenly slashed out from the Pine Ripple Sword that coiled around his body, slashing towards those fists that whistled towards him like the rain.Bang!A transparent fist directly smashed a sword light into pieces, and its momentum didn\u2019t reduce in the slightest as it continued to smash towards Li Huai.\u201cNot good! How could I have forgotten that this kid\u2019s fist technique has already attained the unity-stage, and is able to draw support from the energy of the heaven and earth to increase its might explosively\u2026?\u201dLi Huai was stunned, then suddenly recalled the scene of when he was battle Chen Xi outside Bloodbath City, and his face instantly went gloomy!Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!Countless transparent fists were like a large fisherman\u2019s net as it shattered all the myriad of sword lights that stood in its way to encircle and siege Li Huai who stood in the center!\u201cDammit!\u201dOne wrong move caused him to lose the initiative of the battle. Li Huai could only grit his teeth and circulate the True Essence within his entire body, then grab ahold of his Pine Ripple Sword to swing out sword shadows that were like billowing spindrifts as they flashed out, forming a watertight defense around his surroundings. At the same time, he instead flashed explosively towards the distance, attempting to rush out of the encirclement of the transparent fists that came from all around him.Bang!A transparent fist smashed on the sword shadow around Li Huai\u2019s body, the terrifying True Essence contained within it surged out, and it directly smashed Li Huai flying.Bang! Bang! Bang!Before Li Huai could even catch his breath, another few more fists exploded in around his body, once again blasting him out over 30m away, and his body was staggering and almost dropped to the ground.At this moment, Li Huai\u2019s hair was disheveled and hung down loosely, and his clothes were in rags. His exposed skin was completely charred, and his appearance was in an extremely sorry state. He didn\u2019t dare continue trying to flaunt his superiority any longer and leaped to the ground, only then did he escape the encirclement of those transparent fists.Li Huai gazed at Chen Xi in disbelief. It was truly difficult for him to imagine that everything from earlier was caused by this fellow that he\u2019d always insulted as trash.He\u2019d always thought that he lost to Chen Xi outside of Bloodbath City because his cultivation was restrained and it provided Chen Xi with an opportunity to exploit. However, now, when he utilized the cultivation of the Violet Palace Realm, yet was still forced down from mid-air by Chen Xi. This situation caused him to be utterly unable to accept this reality!At the instant that Li Huai\u2019s mind pondered swiftly, Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but once again get a clear understand of his strength. Only now did he realize.After he thought all this through, Chen Xi didn\u2019t hesitate anymore and launched an attack once again, and his fists were like descended droplets of rain as they completely didn\u2019t give Li Huai any chance to fly up once again.The situation started to become disadvantageous to Li Huai.A portion of his will to fight was taken away by Chen Xi\u2019s attacks earlier, and now that he was devastated by Chen Xi from being forcefully suppressed to battle on the ground, he\u2019d completely fallen into a situation of passive defense.However, it was also impossible for Chen Xi to finish Li Huai off in a short amount of time, as this fellow swung his Pine Ripple Sword about to the point even a drop of water couldn\u2019t pass through, and as it defended the surroundings of his body, he was virtually like a tortoise that had cowered within its shell.Gurgle! Gurgle!The muscles that glowed with a jade-like luster on his entire body expanded and popped out, then fluctuated ceaselessly like a tide with an extremely rhythmic motion, and the vital qi and blood in his body was as if lit ablaze, and emitted waves of thunderous roars.The appearance of Li Huai while passively taking a beating was extremely similar to a sparring dummy, and this caused Chen Xi to think of a good plan. He\u2019d decided to use Li Huai to test how formidable exactly was his body, and he didn\u2019t utilize his True Essence any longer and started to use the pure strength of his body.Bang! Bang! Bang!He\u2019d already confirmed earlier that the Pine Ripple Sword in Li Huai\u2019s hand wasn\u2019t able to injure his tendons and bones, so, Chen Xi didn\u2019t have the slightest worries as he executed his fist techniques now, and coupled with the combat expertise he\u2019s honed from fighting life and death battles, he was able to force his opponent to the point his opponent only had the strength to ward off his blows and nothing more. This feeling was simply captivating and addictive.Li Huai completely didn\u2019t notice that he\u2019d already become the sparring dummy for Chen Xi to test the strength of his body, but at this moment he was utterly unable to notice all this.His mind had already completely fallen into an inexplicably great terror, and as he continued to withstand Chen Xi who got even more courageous as the battle progresses, he bitterly pondered on a way to flee.Up to this point of the battle, his fighting spirit had already been completely depleted, and he wasn\u2019t willing to continue tangling with this freak, Chen Xi, any longer. Even to the extent that he suspected that if it were to continue like this, he would be exhausted to death by Chen Xi.Li Huai felt the True Essence that had reduced within his Dantian, and he seemed to see the footsteps of the god of death silently approaching. For a moment, his heart burned with anxiety, and an extremely short absent-mindedness appeared in his expression.It was right at this moment that Chen Xi\u2019s eyes lit up, he grabbed onto this chance that was difficult to come by and took a step forward, then his right fist swung out like a whip, passing through the cracks between the sword shadows before directly smashing onto Li Huai\u2019s chest with a bang.Kacha! Kacha!A wave of sounds of bones breaking that caused one\u2019s scalp to go numb echoed out, and Li Huai\u2019s chest abruptly sunk to become a cavity. The terrifying strength that surged out from the fist had instantly shattered the bones in his chest, and his internal organs were shattered into countless pieces as well.Pu!Li Huai spat out a mouthful of dense and dark red blood, and his face instantly went white as a sheet. He gazed at Chen Xi with a look that carried along a trace of shock, resentment, frustrations\u2026 and was extremely complicated.\u201cI\u2026 never imagined\u2026 that a jinx like you\u2026 actually\u2026 actually had become so formidable. It\u2019s truly\u2026 ironic!\u201d Li Huai spoke disjointedly, and as soon as he finished speaking, his head turned sideways and he died on the spot.\u201cI originally intended to kill everyone in your Li Clan before your eyes. But now it seems that I\u2019ve let you off lightly.\u201d Chen Xi muttered, then he picked up the Pine Ripple Sword that was still held in Li Huai\u2019s hand. He couldn\u2019t care less to give this fellow\u2019s corpse another glance, and he turned around to walk towards the Goldsoul Divine Lotus.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So long as they were able to become stronger, what was suffering little hardships and enduring a little pain?Unfortunately, the Ancestral House was the vital center of the Li Clan. Besides direct disciples or disciples with extremely outstanding natural talent, others had no hope of taking a step into the Ancestral House within their lifetimes.Today, the door of the Ancestral House that had been tightly closed for many months, slowly opened.Step! Step! Step!A wave of steady and forceful footsteps resounded out on the deep and quiet walkway of the Ancestral House, and after a short moment, a young man walked out from the darkness. It was shockingly Li Ming, the youngest son of the Li Clan patriarch Li Yizhen!However, he was a completely different person when compared to before, his clothes were slovenly, his hair was disheveled hair and he had an unkempt appearance, seeming to have not bathed for a few months. His white skin was rough and dark, and his originally puffy and frivolous triangular eyes had already become gloomy and sharp like a hawk now, shining brightly.\u201cSo it turns out that the feeling of possessing strength is actually so wonderful.\u201dHe clenched his fist. His palms that used to be white were now completely filled with callouses and the bones in his hand had become big and thick. When he clenched his fist tightly, a vicious and fierce aura abruptly surged out from his body.\u201cSecond Young Master, the Patriarch has asked to see you.\u201d Iron Hand, who was enveloped in a ball of dark shadows walked out from the darkness, and his sharp and gloomy voice was like a venomous snake flicking its tongue while concealed in the shadows.\u201cUncle Iron Hand, please lead the way,\u201d Li Ming said respectfully. At this moment, when he possessed strength, he finally understood how terrifying the cultivation of Iron Hand, who was willing to be a shadow and follow by his father\u2019s side all the time, was.Li Clan Main Hall.Li Yizhen sat up straight in the center position and on both of his sides were the numerous elders of the Li Clan. Everyone\u2019s gazes descended onto Li Ming in unison when they saw him enter.Li Ming was able to feel the shock and disbelief within these gazes, and this feeling was extremely wonderful. It felt extremely enjoyable to him, yet his expression was composed and his pace was unhurried. After cupping his hands in greetings, he silently sat on the seat that belonged to him.\u201cThree months of time, attaining the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm from the Postnatal Realm, not bad, not bad.\u201dThe Grand Elder, Li Fengtu, spoke first, his expression revealed happiness as he said with a smile, \u201cNow, Li Huai has already followed Miss Su to enter the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain for a month, he\u2019s probably already found the sword immortal\u2019s abode at this moment. It couldn\u2019t be any better if he\u2019s able to obtain some of the good luck within. Yizhen, you\u2019ve brought two good sons into the world!\u201d\u201cGrand Elder, you\u2019re too kind.\u201d Li Yizhen was extremely happy from obtaining the praise of the Grand Elder.Li Fengtu smiled, then his expression went serious as he said in a serious tone, \u201cI\u2019ve actually gathered everyone here today for an extremely simple matter, that is to decide on the person that will inherit our Li Clan. Although Li Ming isn\u2019t bad, he\u2019s slightly young after all, and there\u2019s quite a gap with Li Huai. I suggest Li Huai inherits the position of our Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch, what does everyone think?\u201d\u201cGrand Elder your discerning eyes are like torches in the dark, Li Huai is indeed not bad as his natural talent and mentality are outstanding amongst his peers as well.\u201d\u201cYes, I agree to Li Huai inheriting the position of Patriarch.\u201d\u201cHaha! Of course, it should be Li Huai. After he returns from the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain this time, he might have already captured Miss Su\u2019s heart and helped to bring about the connection between our Li Clan and the Su Clan through marriage. In this way, wouldn\u2019t the status of our Li Clan rise as well?\u201d\u2026All the elders agreed to Li Fengtu\u2019s opinion.Li Ming who quietly sat at the side felt extreme discomfort in his heart when he saw this.If it was in the past, he wouldn\u2019t fuss about all this at all. Because he was too weak and was utterly unable to compare to Li Huai who was like a favored genius of the gods.But it was different now, he already possessed formidable strength. Although he was still inferior to Li Huai, who could be sure that he wouldn\u2019t surpass Li Huai in the future?\u201cSince everyone has agreed on Li Huai, then\u2026 Huh?\u201d Grand Elder Li Fengtu hadn\u2019t finished speaking when the door of the Main Hall was suddenly pushed open rudely.Manager Wu had an expression of terror as he dashed in with a stagger, then knelt on the ground before shouting out loudly. \u201cPatriarch, Elders, it\u2019s a disaster! Young Master Li Huai\u2019s Soul Vitality Lamp\u2026 has extinguished!\u201dKacha!The teacup in Li Yizhen\u2019s hand dropped onto the ground and shattered into a pile of powder.Everyone\u2019s face went extremely gloomy, and for a time, the atmosphere within the Main Hall became extremely dreary.They\u2019d convened a clan meeting this time to confirm Li Huai\u2019s status as the next Patriarch, however, the results weren\u2019t even announced yet when they were notified of the news of Li Huai\u2019s death. Who could accept this sort of sudden change?\u201cCould it be that an accident occurred within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain?\u201d\u201cHow could it be possible? Li Huai was following along with Miss Su. Allegedly, there are still a few more disciples from the great powers of Dragon Lake City with them. How could he encounter a disaster?\u201d\u201cGod damn it! If I find out who killed my son, Huai, I\u2019ll surely annihilate his entire clan!\u201d\u2026After a short period of silence, enraged cries blasted out to resound within the Main Hall.\u201cShut up!\u201dLi Fengtu shouted out explosively, and when he saw everyone had shut their mouths, he said coldly, \u201cEveryone knows that the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain trials are only for a month\u2019s time. After one month, all the cultivators within it would be teleported out, and only the people that have entered the sword immortal\u2019s abode will be able to continue staying with the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.\u201d\u201cThe next time the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain opens is three years from now, so, even if we\u2019re filled with even more resentment, we won\u2019t be able to see the culprit for another three years. Then, is there any meaning in discussing this matter now?\u201d\u201cGrand Elder, what you mean is?\u201d Li Yizhen forcefully endured the sorrow from losing his son, and his voice was low and hoarse.\u201cThe pressing matter at the moment is to choose the person who\u2019ll inherit the position of Patriarch in the clan. Since Li Huai is gone, then it\u2019ll be changed to be assumed by Li Ming.\u201d Li Fengtu took a deep breath and said word for word. \u201cEveryone, losing a clan member is nothing. What\u2019s important is that all of us can\u2019t only be drowned in grief, and aggrieve those near to us and gladden the enemy!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Everyone\u2019s faces went solemn as they agreed in unison.Li Ming was in slight disbelief as he gazed at everything that happened before his eyes,He was far from being sad or happy about the death of Li Huai because he\u2019d lived beneath Li Huai\u2019s shadow since he was young, so the relationship between the two brothers wasn\u2019t that good.But when he thought of how he\u2019d become the one to inherit the place of Patriarch because of Li Huai\u2019s death, he felt as if he\u2019d eaten a fly in his heart. He felt awfully disgusted.Li Ming roared in his heart,\u201cLi Ming!\u201dThe Grand Elder\u2019s voice sounded out by his ears, and Li Ming awoke from his chaotic thoughts, then he stood up and cupped his hands. \u201cGrand Elder.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think that just because you\u2019ve been chosen to inherit the place of the Patriarch that you\u2019ll surely be able to obtain it. You have to use your strength to prove yourself for all the members of the clan to see. Only by obtaining the acknowledgment of everyone would you be able to become a qualified Patriarch!\u201d The Grand Elder said in a deep voice.Li Ming\u2019s gaze swept past his father and the numerous elders, and lofty sentiments surged within his head as he said clearly. \u201cFather, Elders, I will surely live up to your expectations!\u201dAs he spoke up to here, Li Ming pondered for a short moment, then gritted his teeth and continued. \u201cBrother is gone. Then from today onwards, I\u2019ve decided to replace him in not only the place of Patriarch, but I also want to get married to Miss Su of the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan!\u201d\u201cOh, what do you plan to do?\u201d A trace of a curious light flashed within Li Fengtu\u2019s eyes.\u201cSince the Su Clan has agreed that so long as we humiliate Chen Xi\u2019s family to death, they would betroth Miss Su to my Li Clan. I\u2019ll start from here.\u201dLi Ming replied without hesitation. \u201cOf course, Li Huai has always been conducting this plan. But please be at ease Grand Elder, I\u2019ll be even crueler and better than my brother. So long as they\u2019re related to Chen Xi\u2019s family, then I won\u2019t let any of them off!\u201d\u201cDo you have a target?\u201d Li Fengtu continued to question.\u201cYes! The boss of the Pine Mist City\u2019s Zhang General Store, all the talisman crafting apprentices under him, and all the neighbors within an area of 300m from Chen Xi\u2019s house.\u201dA trace of madness flashed within Li Ming\u2019s eyes. \u201cI want them all dead, annihilated! I want to tell everyone in Pine Mist City that they died because of Chen Xi! I want everyone to know that even if they have the slightest bit of relationship with Chen Xi, then they\u2019re bound to face death and destruction!\u201dThe numerous elders present gasped inwardly, and their gazes when they looked at Li Ming couldn\u2019t help but carry along a trace of worry.\u201cGood!\u201dGrand Elder Li Fengtu was silent for a long time, yet he unexpectedly clapped and praised. \u201cLosers are always in the wrong, and only the strong are respected. So long as it\u2019s beneficial to my Li Clan, it\u2019s still worth it even if your methods are a hundred times more atrocious!\u201dLi Ming was anxious and fearful after he finished speaking of his plan. At this moment, he couldn\u2019t help but be extremely happy from suddenly obtaining the acknowledgement of the Grand Elder, and he cupped his hands and said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry Grand Elder, it isn\u2019t merely for the sake of the marriage with Su Jiao, it\u2019s also for the sake of our Li Clan\u2019s strengthening and expansion in the future. I\u2019ll surely deal with Chen Xi until the Su Clan is satisfied!\u201dAs he spoke, a trace of regret couldn\u2019t help but arise in Li Ming\u2019s heart.\u201cAccording to my knowledge, Chen Xi has followed Du Qingxi to enter the sword immortal\u2019s abode, and he probably won\u2019t appear within the next three years. This period of time is sufficient to do anything. Li Ming, do you understand what I mean?\u201d Li Fengtu asked.Li Ming nodded.Li Fengtu said in a deep voice, \u201cGo! If you\u2019re able to take care of this matter beautifully and make the Su Clan satisfied. Then with my status as Grand Elder, I\u2019ll guarantee that the Patriarch of our Li Clan will surely be you!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLi Ming took a deep breath, then turned around and left. He knew that this was a test to him, and at the same time, it was the best opportunity for him to change his destiny.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - Goldsoul Lotus FruitPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58 - Goldsoul Lotus FruitHundred Herb Hall\u201cIt isn\u2019t time yet, wait a while. It ought to take another incense stick\u2019s worth of time more before this Goldsoul Lotus Fruit will mature and drop. You have to use your True Essence and absorb it into your Dantian before it touches the ground.\u201dAfter annihilating Li Huai, Ji Yu had appeared once again and he pointed at the Goldsoul Divine Lotus as he spoke confidently. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to use this Goldsoul Lotus Fruit once you\u2019ve cultivated your soul to the stage of Divine Sense.According to Chen Xi\u2019s knowledge, not mentioning those heaven defying geniuses, ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivators possessed Perception Force, Golden Hall Realm cultivators possessed Spiritual Perception, Golden Core Realm cultivators possessed Divine Perception, and only Rebirth Realm cultivators possessed Divine Sense.Because of possessing the Fuxi Divine Status within his sea of consciousness, Chen Xi was naturally not within the ordinary ranks. Although he was only at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm, his soul had already condensed Perception Force, and it was completely capable of matching ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivators!Chen Xi said curiously, \u201cWhat miraculous effect does the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit actually possess? Could it be that it\u2019s a treasure that benefits the strength of the soul?\u201dJi Yu instead avoided the question and didn\u2019t answer and only said, \u201cIt\u2019s of no use if you know now. It\u2019s better if you keep your mind on cultivating. Advancing the strength of your soul is what you need to do now.\u201dChen Xi was helpless,\u201cOh, you can\u2019t waste this spirit spring as well. Seize this opportunity to gather some spirit liquid. According to my estimation, at the instant the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit matures, it will completely absorb all the nearby spirit energy. At that time, you\u2019ll be unable to obtain anything.\u201d Ji Yu glanced at the spirit spring and reminded.At this moment, Chen Xi suddenly realized that having the spirit of the Manor that has existed for a million years by his side was truly a joyful thing.If Ji Yu wasn\u2019t here, he might have pulled out the Goldsoul Divine Lotus by the roots and taken it away by now, and it would be completely impossible for him to know that when the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit matured, it would actually completely absorb all the nearby spirit energy\u2026Chen Xi took out the octagonal containment bottle from his storage ring and started to squat beside the spirit spring to gather the spirit liquid.The insides of this octagonal containment bottle was divided into eight enormous spaces, one of them contained the nearly 250kg of liquid condensed from Netherezim Baleful Qi. Another seven empty space still remained within, and in total it was sufficient to contain more than 500,000 kg of liquids.Chen Xi said regretfully in his heart. According to the speed the spirit liquid poured out from the spirit spring, it would be quite good if he was able to gather 5,000 kg of spirit liquid before the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit matured.\u201cInfant Pixiu, Goldsoul Divine Lotus\u2026 Although this immortal, Nether Enlightenment, is only a fallen immortal, his ability is extremely shocking. He was actually able to find such divine items. In his time, he was probably someone with great karmic luck.\u201dJi Yu looked at the Goldsoul Divine Lotus and seemed to speak from feelings as he sighed with emotion. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s all benefitted you now. In terms of the strength of karmic luck, then this immortal, Nether Enlightenment, is still inferior to you.\u201dChen Xi was stunned, then shook his head and said, \u201cHow could that be possible? Everyone calls me Jinx in Pine Mist City.\u201d\u201cA man cannot be without arrogance, there\u2019s no need to look down on yourself.\u201dJi Yu said in disdain, \u201cThe people who said you\u2019re a jinx are a group of idiots. If you\u2019re a jinx, then would you be able to obtain the True Body Brand of my Master? Would you be able to walk out of the Star Secret Realm? In the future, so long as you unceasingly work hard in your cultivations, then so long as no accidents happen, you\u2019re completely able to pass through all the trials in the Heavenpeak of Trials and inherit the mantle of my Master to become an unequaled expert in your time.\u201dAs he spoke up to here, Ji Yu stared fixedly at Chen Xi and asked, \u201cNow, do you still think you\u2019re a jinx?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Chen Xi shook his head decisively. What Ji Yu said was indeed the truth. If he still denied it, then he would be acting.Ji Yu said in praise, \u201cOf course not. Moreover, you possess an infant Pixiu by your side now, you karmic luck will only become better.\u201dChen Xi was praised to the point he blushed slightly, and he was just intending to change the topic when he suddenly thought of something. Half an hour had already passed, and the chaotic battle between Chai Letian and Su Jiao had probably already finished.Chen Xi\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but constrict at the instant this thought emerged in his mind. At this moment, he didn\u2019t think about how to sneak attack Chai Letian anymore. So long as Chai Letian didn\u2019t die, he could go kill Chai Letian at any time, but the time the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit drops to the ground was only an instant. Comparatively speaking, the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit before him was still more important.\u201cGet ready, it\u2019s about to mature!\u201dJi Yu\u2019s voice abruptly exploded out by his ears. Chen Xi didn\u2019t dare let his mind wander anymore and he poured his True Essence into his palms as he stared fixedly at the Goldsoul Divine Lotus without batting an eyelid.Under the cover of the strands and threads of pistils and stamens, the infant fist-sized golden fruit seemed to be breathing, and circles of dense golden ripples appeared on its surface.Splash! Splash!A pillar of water that was like a waterfall suddenly shot out from within the nearby spirit spring and surged straight towards the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit. All the spirit energy within the Hundred Herb Hall was like sharks that had smelt blood and madly surged towards the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit.Whereas the golden fruit was like a bottomless pit, accepting all the spirit energy that was nearby. As the amount of spirit energy it had absorbed increased, the golden light on its surface grew denser and more eye piercing, seeming to be like a small sun.Bang! Bang! Bang!Seeming to have activated something, the entire Hundred herb Hall abruptly started to sway violently, and layers of transparent waves rippled out in the air surrounding the Goldsoul Divine Lotus and the air seemed as if it would shatter in the next moment.At the same time, an inexplicable terrifying oppressive force invaded the hall from every direction, and Chen Xi who was beside the Goldsoul Divine Lotus felt it even more strongly. It felt as if his throat was choked, causing him to feel suffocated and nearly be unable to control the True Essence that was restless within his body!Even though the boundless oppressive force suppressed him to the point it was difficult to breathe, but Chen Xi\u2019s eyes grew brighter and brighter, and his nerves were strained to the limit.Roar!A clear and melodious sound that was like the roar of a dragon sounded out, from a low sound that was inaudible, it gradually became loud and resonant, and in the end, it transformed into a billowing wave of music that vibrated in every corner of the Hundred Herb Hall.Right at this moment, the stem, branches, and petals of Goldsoul Divine Lotus burnt into nothingness at a noticeable speed, and the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit covered within the pistil and stamens lightly shook, then it fell!Whoosh!Practically the instant the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit dropped, the True Essence that Chen Xi had kept ready in his palm since a long time ago transformed into a ray of light that was like a waterfall, and it instantly enveloped the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit before being swallowed by Chen Xi into his Dantian. His actions were so swift that is was almost completely in an instant, as if he\u2019d practiced it countless times earlier.Chen Xi was slightly unable to believe it, but when he felt the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit that quietly floated within his Dantian, he finally believed that he\u2019d indeed succeeded.At this moment, within his Dantian, nine clouds that were condensed from True Essence formed a ladder that went upwards layer by layer. Whereas at the bottommost area of his Dantian, the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit quietly floated there. The surface of the lotus fruit ceaselessly emitted strands and threads of golden light, and the entire scene of it within his Dantian seemed extremely harmonious, without any abnormalities.This also allowed Chen Xi to be much more at ease.Thump! Thump! Thump!The Hundred Herb Hall swayed more furiously by the moment, and piece after piece of enormous rocks that were an entire 300m long collapsed from above. It seemed as if spider webs had formed on the surrounding walls as they fell off and shattered, causing ash and dust to billow in the air, and countless deep trenches that were continuous and had no end had split open on the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s as expected. The Goldsoul Divine Lotus was the point the spirit energy within this entire hall gathered, and at the same time, it maintained the balance in the entire hall. At this moment, the Goldsoul Divine Lotus has withered away and the spirit energy has completely dried up as well. So, the entire hall has lost its support and will surely collapse.\u201dJi Yu swept his gaze at the surroundings then said swiftly, \u201cLeave! Quickly!\u201dAt the same time that Ji Yu spoke, Chen Xi had already perceived a hint of trouble. At this moment, he didn\u2019t dare hesitate and picked up the octagonal containment bottle on the floor before violently dashing out of the hall.Bang!At the instant he exited the hall, the Hundred Herb Hall behind Chen Xi that covered an area of 500km collapsed with a bang. For a moment, enormous rocks flew into the air and dust soared into the sky, the stream of air that was emitted from the collapse was like a whistling hurricane, and it scraped Chen Xi\u2019s face to the point it hurt.\u201cChen Xi!\u201d A voice that was chilly like ice suddenly sounded out.Chen Xi looked over and saw to his surprise that Chai Letian\u2019s group, including Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin, stood 300m in the distance. The only people that were missing from the group were the pair of twins, Du Quan and Du Kui, of Windsoar Institution.Moreover, exhaustion that was difficult to disguise filled the space between their brows, and their clothes were stained with patches of blood. It was a wonder if the blood was their own or their enemies.When he saw this scene, Chen Xi understood that the chaotic battle within the Book Reserve Hall had already ended. If he wasn\u2019t wrong, Du Kui and Du Quan would have surely lost their lives in the chaotic battle.However, Chen Xi didn\u2019t pay any attention to all this, as the fact that Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin were still alive caused his mood to be much more cheerful.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re fine.\u201d At this moment, Du Qingxi was looking over here with a complicated gaze that seemed furious, disappointed, and so on and so forth.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.Duanmu Ze was unable to refrain himself in the end, and he said harshly, \u201cChen Xi, why did you do that to us? To think that I took you to be a brother, yet I never expected that you\u2019d be so cold and heartless!\u201dThe nearby Song Lin shook his head as well, yet didn\u2019t say anything.A wisp of rage surged out from the bottom of Chen Xi\u2019s heart, and he pointed at Chai Letian as he asked, \u201cSince you took me to be a brother, then why didn\u2019t you stand up for me when he threw me down the chasm that day? Not only that, you\u2019re still following by his side all this time. Let me ask you, what right do you have to say this?\u201dDuanmu Ze\u2019s expression froze and was speechless.Whereas when Du Qingxi and Song Lin heard what Chen Xi said, their expression became unnatural as well.\u201cI know that there\u2019s a Nether Transformation Realm ancestor behind this Chai fellow, and you don\u2019t dare offend him due to consideration for your clans. I can understand all this.\u201d\u201cBut, who will understand me? Could it be that just because my identity is inferior to everyone else, you don\u2019t have to care about my feelings at all?\u201cBesides that, I only spoke a single sentence and was utterly unsure if it would be able to cause a chaotic battle, and the reason I did so was extremely simple as well; it was for the sake of seizing the opportunity to kill Chai Letian. You call me cold and heartless just because of this?\u201dAt this moment, Chen Xi seemed unusually agitated and was virtually a different person compared to his usually reserved self.But, this also showed one thing. No matter if Chen Xi admitted it or not, in his heart, he\u2019d already taken Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three as his friends.He was insulted as a jinx since a young age, and practically no one of the same age took him to be a friend. Du Qingxi\u2019s group was the first group of friends he\u2019d obtained in his 16 years of life. Even though they were only ordinary friends and weren\u2019t to the extent of being able to bare open their hearts to each other, he still cherished this piece of friendship extremely.It was precisely because of this that Chen Xi would become so agitated.Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three were silent and speechless as what Chen Xi said caused them to be unable to arouse the desire to provide any explanation. This was the truth and they were unable to deny it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - Taking Every Possibility Into AccountPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59 - Taking Every Possibility Into AccountChen Xi and Duanmu Ze didn\u2019t hide anything as they spoke and used an almost straightforward way to vent the dissatisfaction within their hearts. Thus, this attitude of facing each other straightforwardly seemed rare and precious.But, when their conversation entered the ears of the others, it was instead as if they\u2019d heard an extremely great joke.On one side was a disciple from an impoverished family who\u2019d been poverty-stricken and in very poor circumstances since a young age, and was even the jinx of Pine Mist City that was well known in every household. On the other side was the favored genius from one of the six great clans of Dragon Lake City who possessed a lofty and respected status.Regardless of status or identity, and even cultivation, there was an insurmountable gap between these two people. How could they become friends?In the cultivation world where status was ranked by endowment, if this wasn\u2019t a joke, then what was?In the eyes of Chai Letian and the others, the current Chen Xi was undoubtedly talking nonsense like a pitiable idiot.\u201cHe\u2019s truly like an idiot. Fortunately, my father tore apart our marriage contract that year\u2026\u201d It was at this moment that Su Jiao\u2019s voice slowly sounded out from the other side.Chen Xi\u2019s mood was agitated and he actually only noticed at this moment that Su Jiao\u2019s group stood 300m in the distance on the other side.Similar to Chai Letian\u2019s group, Su Jiao\u2019s group all had clothes tainted with blood and exhausted expressions. Moreover, only 9 people remained within their group that originally consisted of 13 people. Their losses were actually more disastrous than Chai Letian\u2019s group.Chen Xi felt a chilly sensation in his heart, and the flames of rage in his chest instantly subsided. His gaze scanned the surroundings but he didn\u2019t notice any traces of the people from Phoenixcloud Sect.Chen Xi was slightly unable to believe it, but when he pondered about it for a moment, this was also the inference that was the closest to the truth.After all, the Phoenixcloud Sect\u2019s group was formed from disciples of small powers in the southern territory. Although they had Violet Palace Realm cultivations, they were obviously unable to compare to Su Jiao and Chai Letian\u2019s groups that were from the ancient and great powers of Dragon Lake City.\u201cMiss Su, the culprit that caused our groups to suffer disastrous losses is standing before us. Are you going to do it, or should I?\u201dChai Letian said in an unhurried manner, \u201cThe chaotic battle in the Book Reserve Hall was caused by this kid. Now the complete collapse of the Hundred Herb Hall seems to be caused by this kid as well. Not only might there be numerous jade slips stored in his possession, moreover, there would also be the treasures of nature he\u2019d obtained from the Hundred Herb Hall. If you don\u2019t make a move, then I\u2019ll strike first and reap the benefits from him.\u201d\u201cHmph! As if you\u2019d be so kind?\u201d Su Jiao grunted coldly, yet she thought in her heart.Chai Letian roared with laughter. \u201cHaha! A straightforward person doesn\u2019t resort to beating around the bush, I have conditions of course.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d Su Jiao frowned.Chai Letian said without hesitation, \u201cMy conditions are the things in this kid\u2019s possession, we\u2019ll split it fifty-fifty.\u201dIt could be said that this condition couldn\u2019t be better. After they\u2019d experienced the chaotic battle from before, they had an even deeper understanding of each other\u2019s strengths after all. If they were to get into battle because of the things in Chen Xi\u2019s possession, then the price they paid would be too high, and it was extremely not worthwhile.Whereas at this moment, Chai Letian had obviously understood this, so he put forward this suggestion.However, Su Jiao still felt slightly uneasy. According to her knowledge, Chai Letian\u2019s possessive desires were extremely strong and wasn\u2019t someone so easy to deal with. It was rather unbelievable that he was able to put forward such a suggestion.\u201cAlright, I agree.\u201d After thinking it over, again and again, Su Jiao still decided to give it a try.It was at this moment that Chen Xi who was watching on coldly all long spoke out abruptly. \u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, then after the chaotic battle earlier, all of you are surely injured as well. Even if all of you aren\u2019t injured, your physical strength and True Essence would surely have been almost completely exhausted.\u201dMinute changes appeared on the expressions of everyone behind Chai Letian and Su Jiao when they heard this.Chen Xi noticed this and was even surer of the deduction in his heart, and he spoke once again. \u201cI killed Li Huai in the Hundred Herb Hall earlier. If all of you think that you\u2019re able to defeat me in your current conditions, then feel free to come at me!\u201dSu Jiao\u2019s expression suddenly sank. When they entered the Book Reserve Hall, Li Huai had silently left according to her wishes and headed to the Hundred Herb Hall. So he wasn\u2019t swept into the chaotic battle earlier, and his strength was in peak condition and would only surpass her current condition.If it was really like Chen Xi had said, and Li Huai had died miserably at his hands. Then wouldn\u2019t it mean that it would be impossible for everyone present to be a match for Chen Xi?Clang!Chen Xi casually tossed Li Huai\u2019s Pine Ripple Sword on the floor, yet didn\u2019t explain any further. Because the truth was always more convincing than words.As expected, when she saw the Pine Ripple Sword on the floor, Su Jiao was unable to maintain her composure any longer and cried out involuntarily. \u201cHow can this be possible? After entering the sword immortal\u2019s abode, Li Huai\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t restricted any longer. With his Violet Palace Realm cultivation, how could he have been killed by Chen Xi?\u201dIn the distance, Chai Letian\u2019s pupils constricted and various thoughts arose within his heart.Numerous thoughts flashed past Chai Letian\u2019s mind, and Chai Letian\u2019s expression had already become incomparably gloomy. Up to this point, Chai Letian had to admit that Chen Xi was an extremely formidable opponent. The resoluteness and viciousness of Chen Xi\u2019s mind, Chen Xi\u2019s grasp of the situation that was meticulous in every possible way, and Chen Xi\u2019s careful scheming that took every conceivable possibility into account, caused Chai Letian to be extremely fearful of Chen Xi.Without any reason or rhyme, an extremely preposterous thought arose within Chai Letian\u2019s heart.Chai Letian had to helplessly accept reality. Because, besides looking on and doing nothing, he\u2019d already lost all ability to deal with Chen Xi!Su Jiao\u2019s feelings were almost similar to Chai Letian, and the reason she was afraid was no different from Chai Letian. Even to the extent that she understood Chen Xi\u2019s strength even better than Chai Letian.She'd once seen the battle between Chen Xi and Li Huai outside Bloodbath City with her own two eyes. Despite Chen Xi only possessing a cultivation at the Congenital Realm, his cultivation in the Martial Dao wasn\u2019t inferior to a Violet Palace Realm cultivation, and even surpassed a Violet Palace Realm cultivator. After all, within their current group of people, only Cang Bin was able to cultivate a martial technique to the extent of the unity-stage, and even she was unable to accomplish this.Whereas not only did Chen Xi\u2019s fist technique attain the unity-stage, even his sword technique faintly possessed traces of breaking through to the unity-stage. A freak like this couldn\u2019t be measured with common sense, and Chen Xi killing Li Huai was sufficient to explain everything.Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three were naturally able to notice the subtle changes that were occurring in the atmosphere, and enormous changes occurred in the gazes they shot at Chen Xi.Astonishment, shock, bewilderment\u2026 They seemed as if it was the first time they\u2019d known Chen Xi.Because, it was impossible for them to imagine even if they wracked their brains, just relying on a string of words and a sword, Chen Xi was able to turn the entire situation around. This level of ability had already exceeded their imagination, and only producing clouds with a turn of the hand and producing rain with another could describe this.Within this silent atmosphere, Chen Xi lifted his feet and walked towards the distance. His expression was as normal, without the slightest awareness of being under tight encirclement, and he walked in an extremely firm and balanced manner.\u201cBrother Chai, why don\u2019t we first kill this fellow together?\u201dSu Jiao\u2019s voice was as if forced out from the cracks in her teeth, and the gaze she looked at Chen Xi almost spouted fire.When he heard her, Chai Letian looked at Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three and didn\u2019t say anymore. But the meaning in his gaze couldn\u2019t be any clearer.Su Jiao was stunned, then came to an understanding. At this moment, if those three people were to jump out and help Chen Xi, it would truly be a cause for a headache.Su Jiao\u2019s conflicted mood had already reached an extreme state.In the Book Reserve Hall, the chaotic battle of three groups was caused because of a single sentence from Chen Xi. At this moment, it was again what he said and the sword he tossed on the floor that caused the two groups of people that wished for nothing more than to kill him and rob him, dare not act rashly\u2026A trace of complicated feelings that were beyond expression couldn\u2019t help but arise within the hearts of everyone.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - 10,000 Year WaitPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60 - 10,000 Year WaitHu!Chen Xi heaved a long sigh of relief when he confirmed that he\u2019d broken away from the range everyone\u2019s Perception Force could lock onto him, and only now did he realize that the clothes on his body had already become completely drenched with cold sweat.Chen Xi could be said to have been caught in a hopeless situation when he was surrounded by Chai Letian and Su Jiao\u2019s group earlier, and it was pure luck that he was able to get away safely.There were roughly two reasons for this.The first \u2014 After experiencing the tragic chaotic battle within the Book Reserve Hall, Chai Letian and Su Jiao\u2019s groups were already in a state of exhaustion, whereas the fact that Chen Xi was able to easily kill Li Huai who was at the Violet Palace Realm had undoubtedly caused them to be extremely fearful.The second \u2014 Chai Letian\u2019s group and Su Jiao\u2019s groups were both suspicious and fearful of each other, and they were worried that the other group would reap the final reward once they made a move against Chen Xi.Of course, there were also various other factors, but comparatively speaking, if it wasn\u2019t for Chen Xi acutely perceiving the two points above and taking action on them, it would be absolutely impossible for him to leave so easily.Even to the extent that once a minute mistake was to appear in this process, it was possible to cause Chen Xi to fall into eternal doom.Chen Xi didn\u2019t ponder over it anymore, nor did he hesitate in the slightest as he started to dash off violently.Along with the passage of time, the strength of Chai Letian and Su Jiao\u2019s groups would surely recover gradually. If he was unable to find a safe place to conceal himself during this period of time, then everything would go back to square one.The Southern Barbaric Nether Domain was isolated from the rest of the world and they had to wait for it to open three years from now before they would be able to leave.It could be said that if Chen Xi wanted to avoid the pursuit of Chai Letian and the others for these three years, then he must find a concealed location that no one was able to discover.However, Chen Xi felt helpless, as not only was he unable to find a place to conceal himself, he even had no way to leave this sword immortal\u2019s abode.Chen Xi had already looked through the map of the entire sword immortal\u2019s abode in the main hall\u2019s core area earlier, and he was extremely sure of this.If the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain was said to be a small space that was isolated from the rest of the world, then the sword immortal\u2019s abode was an even smaller space that was established within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. Besides the Tri-Factor Teleportation Formation used to enter here, there wasn\u2019t a single other path of access.Chen Xi pondered and pondered, and his footsteps had unconsciously dashed towards the main hall.When he was teleported in, he\u2019d appeared within the main hall, and he subconsciously took this place to be his lair.Not long after, Chen Xi once again returned to the main hall.As he gazed at the jade bed and the work table within the simple room, Chen Xi felt much more at ease, and then he sat cross-legged on the bed and started to rest with closed eyes.Not even half a day had passed since entering the sword immortal\u2019s abode, but to Chen Xi, every moment was extremely breathtaking.Seeking treasures, stirring up a chaotic battle, killing Li Huai, collecting the Goldsoul Divine Lotus, getting away from the tight encirclement\u2026 Incident after incident, each more dangerous than before. It was like dancing on the edge of a blade and one wrong move would cause the whole game to be lost. Although Chen Xi\u2019s physique had already been tempered to be extremely formidable, he still felt the exertion too great to endure.Gradually\u2026The strands of cool and refreshing cold qi that was emitted from the jade bed caused Chen Xi\u2019s mind to become tranquil and devoid of any distracting thoughts.Within his sea of consciousness, the Fuxi Divine Statue that emitted an ancient and vast aura was still glowing with a myriad of misty fine lights, and Chen Xi\u2019s soul sat cross-legged before the divine status with a serene expression.His strained nerves calmed down and his mind and physical strength recovered bit by bit. He completely didn\u2019t notice that a black figure that was like mist had suddenly appeared within the jade bed under his butt.Whoosh!Chen Xi\u2019s body froze and he felt as if there was something else within his body, and it was surging towards his sea of consciousness at an extremely swift pace.Chen Xi quickly opened his eyes, however, before he could wrap his head around the matter, he felt a loud \u2018Om\u2019 echo out in his mind, then a sharp and hoarse voice resounded out with a rumble.\u201cHuehuehue\u2026 I\u2019ve waited for 10,000 years, and I, Nether Enlightenment, have finally awaited for a superb body! The heavens didn\u2019t disappoint me after all!\u201dAlong with the voice, a black figure swiftly appeared within Chen Xi\u2019s sea of consciousness. The black figure\u2019s face was gaunt and pale with sunken eye sockets, yet his eyes were long and thin like the edge of a sword, and they were extremely bright.\u201cHahaha! So long as I possess this body, I\u2019ll be able to cultivate once again. With the infant Pixiu and Goldsoul Divine Lotus in my possession, why should I worry about being unable to overcome the damned ninth level of the heavenly tribulation?\u201dWithin his sea of consciousness, Chen Xi swiftly stood up and gazed at the black clothed person that seemed as if he\u2019d appeared out of thin air, then shouted loudly, \u201cNether Enlightenment?\u201d\u201cExactly! Kid, I presume you coveted the treasures stored within my abode, so you relied on the Nether Enlightenment Token to enter, right? Hahaha! Too bad! Your soul is about to be devoured by me, and your body will become mine!\u201dAs expected, the figure that was like black mist was shockingly the soul of the immortal, Nether Enlightenment.Chen Xi\u2019s expression remained unfazed as he asked coldly, \u201cAll this was a trap you\u2019d devised beforehand?\u201d\u201cOf course! Did you think I left this immortal estate behind and sent my Nether Enlightenment Tokens into the outside world for the sake of allowing all of you to divide up my treasures?\u201dNether Enlightenment gazed at Chen Xi with a gaze of pity, and a wisp of burning greed surged out from his eyes that were long and thin like a blade. \u201cKid, obediently allow me to devour your soul. Your body being able to be used by me is an extremely great fortune you can\u2019t obtain in your entire lifetime.\u201d\u201cHmph! Even if you devour my soul, your cultivation would only be at the Congenital Realm. How would you be able to leave this place? Numerous enemies that wish for nothing more than to kill me are concealed outside.\u201d Chen Xi said loudly.\u201cKid, put away your little tricks. Don\u2019t you just want to know how to leave this immortal estate?\u201dNether Enlightenment glanced at Chen Xi in disdain, then he sneered. \u201cI can tell you since you\u2019re about to die, but\u2026\u201dAs he spoke up to here, killing intent flashed within Nether Enlightenment\u2019s eyes, then he abruptly flashed out explosively, transforming into a ball of billowing black mist as he enveloped towards Chen Xi.\u201cBut, I\u2019ll only tell you after I devour your soul! Hahaha!\u201d As he gazed at Chen Xi who was obviously frightened by him to the point he dared not move, Nether Enlightenments complacent roars of laughter echoed out from within the billowing black mist.\u201cSince you\u2019re unwilling to tell me, then die!\u201d When the black mist Nether Enlightenment had transformed to was about to envelop Chen Xi, Chen Xi who stared blankly on the spot without moving suddenly shot out a strand of a cold light that was dazzling and bright from his eyes.Om!A cold sound of chanting that seemed to have come from ancient times resounded within his sea of consciousness, then an enormous figure of a thin old man appeared out of thin air within his sea of consciousness. The old man was barefooted and wore linen clothes, with and sat cross-legged in the air just like that, seeming like a towering mountain that couldn\u2019t be worn away even after experiencing countless years of time. His gaze was deep and vast, and myriads of divine lights enveloped his body. At the instant he appeared, he\u2019d lit up Chen Xi\u2019s entire sea of consciousness.Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!The black mist that the immortal, Nether Enlightenment, transformed to melted like ice in water at the instant it was enveloped by the myriad of fine lights from the Fuxi Divine Statue, and he slowly withered away bit by bit at a speed that was noticeable by the eye.\u201cAh! How could this be possible! It\u2019s actually a True Body Brand left behind by an almighty figure from the primordial era.\u201d Nether Enlightenments voice revealed boundless terror as he screamed miserably. \u201cNo!!\u201dIn practically an instant, the black mist was burnt into nothingness within the myriad of fine lights, and the voice of Nether Enlightenment before his death still lingered within Chen Xi\u2019s sea of consciousness.Chen Xi started gasping for breath after he was sure that the immortal, Nether Enlightenment, was completely dead.Even though what he face earlier was merely a strand of Nether Enlightenment\u2019s soul, Chen Xi still felt boundless pressure. That was the gap in Realms, and it caused him to be nearly unable to arouse the desire to resist.\u201cFortunately, I possess the True Body Brand left behind by Senior Fuxi. I obviously made the right gamble this time. If it wasn\u2019t for this, I\u2019m afraid it would be absolutely difficult for me to escape this disaster.\u201dChen Xi had a lingering fear in his heart as he thought about everything that had happened earlier, and boundless gratitude arose in his heart as he gazed upon the ancient divine status in his sea of consciousness that remained the same eternally.Rumble!It was at this moment that an enormous bang that was like muffled thunder from the highest reaches of the heavens echoed out, and the entire main hall shook violently as if there was an earthquake.Chen Xi hurriedly stood up and swiftly dashed out, however, to his astonishment, regardless of where he went, the violent shaking like an earthquake remained.Treasure Hall, Book Reserve Hall\u2026 All the buildings within the sword immortal\u2019s abode were like volcanos that were in deep sleep for a thousand years, and at this moment, they\u2019d awoken and erupted!\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cFlee quickly! This sword immortal\u2019s abode is about to be destroyed!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dAt this moment, no matter was it Chai Letian\u2019s group or Su Jiao\u2019s group, their faces all went pale. They didn\u2019t dare hesitate any longer, swiftly flying back and forth between the numerous buildings that were crashing down with a bang as they desperately fled for their lives in panic.Outside the sword immortal\u2019s abode, the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain\u2019s Dusty Nightmare Area, Sanguinary Mountain, Crimsonflame Mountain Range\u2026 They were as if being slapped wantonly by the hands of gods, and numerous enormous rifts that were frightening had split open on the ground and spread throughout the entire Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.The baleful beasts were fleeing, they who didn\u2019t possess a shred of intelligence were under the influence of their instinct to live, and they fled disorderly in terror and panic. However, no matter where they ran, in the end, they would be devoured by the enormous rifts in the ground.Kacha! Kacha!The surrounding space seemed to be unable to endure this sort of pressure and shattered into numerous pitch-black rifts. At the instant the bits and pieces of rocks and stone dropped into the pitch-black rifts, they silently vanished.At this moment, it was as if doomsday had arrived in the entire Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. The ground quaked and space shattered as if everything would be completely destroyed in the next moment!\u2026\u201cEh!\u201d Deep within the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, a violet robed handsome young man stood atop a cliff and he raised his eyes to gaze at the space where the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain resided.He had a tall figure and an unusually handsome face. His gaze was deep like a lake and two balls of violet lightning seemed to be revolving within his pupils. The afterglow of the setting sun that was like blood shone on his face and added on a strange and mysterious aura to him.\u201cInteresting, the wasteland within the spatial tear is about to be destroyed?\u201dThe gaze of the violet robed handsome young man seemed to be able to pass through all the barriers in space and allow him to see some scenes that ordinary people were unable to see.\u201cOh, there are actually people who haven\u2019t come out? Hmm, I\u2019ve killed too much these few days, even though they\u2019re only some animals, but the old man will surely scold me to death if he finds out. Alright, I\u2019ll just take it as doing some good deeds to accumulate some virtue\u2026\u201dThe violet robed young man stroked his chin and pondered for a short moment, then he stretched out his hand to grab towards the space that the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain resided in.\u2014 End of Book One \u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61 Mu KuiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 61 \u2013 Mu KuiThe magnificent and beautiful mountain range was like layer upon layer of unbroken waves.Numerous large mountains that were nearly 33km tall wound up high into the clouds. The mountains stood high and low with various bizarre shapes, as if numerous enormous beasts of ancient times were silently settled there.At the moment it was dusk and the afterglow of the setting sun poured down like a bloody glow that tainted clouds and mist. The vast and towering mountains bathed under the light of the setting sun and drew a grand and magnificent scene.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cWhere is this?\u201dA youth was muttering to himself on a precipitous cliff that was over 30 kilometers high. His face was thin and handsome with a crude and resolute expression between his brows, and he carried along a disposition that was tough like iron. Shockingly, it was Chen Xi.Clouds that fluttered in the wind like cotton drifted atop the cliff. Mountain wind whistled by as he stood within the sea of clouds, his clothes flapped as the wind blew upon them, seeming as if they would fly away with the wind in the next moment.However, at this time, Chen Xi instead had a frown on his face, and his eyes were filled with an expression of deep thought. \u201cI undoubtedly remember that at the instant the immortal estate collapsed, I was still fleeing madly and aimlessly, and I nearly thoughts I\u2019d die within the immortal estate. How did I appear here in the blink of an eye?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ponder any longer, there was an almighty expert that tore through space and saved all of you.\u201d Ji Yu silently appeared to stand within the sea of clouds at the edge of the cliff, and his expression had a trace of bewilderment as well.Chen Xi gasped, he was truly unable to imagine an expert of exactly what cultivation would possess the terrifying ability to tear through space.He noticed something after a short while, Ji Yu had said \u2018all of you,\u2019 Thus, it went without speaking that Chai Letian and Su Jiao\u2019s group were saved as well.\u201cBut why did that expert lend a hand?\u201d Chen Xi asked.Ji Yu shook his head and sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t wrap my head around it either. Perhaps he just happened to pass by and saw all of you at death's door, so he lent a hand to help accumulate some virtue for himself.\u201dChen Xi was unable to contemplate the reason so he didn\u2019t continue pondering about it, and he murmured with a sigh. \u201cI got away by luck, yet I\u2019m within these layers upon layers of enormous mountains. The mountain range goes on one after the other, and there actually seems to be no end. I wonder which direction will allow me to return to Pine Mist City?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s as I\u2019ve predicted, then this place ought to be the interior of the 5,000 km Southern Barbaric Mountain Range. Look over there. Demonic qi that\u2019s condensed and doesn\u2019t dissipate has shot up into the heavens. Obviously, there\u2019s a greater demon with a monstrous imposing aura residing there.\u201d Ji Yu stretched out his finger to point towards a towering mountain in the distance that rose into the sky.Chen Xi was shocked inwardly and he raised his eyes to gaze over at the direction Ji Yu pointed at. As expected, billowing black mist coiled atop the peak of the mountain in the distance, and the black mist was like a smoke signal that that was condensed and didn\u2019t dissipate as it rose into the sky.Although a demon beast was capable of taking human form when it stepped into the Congenital Realm, it was unable to get rid of the demonic qi on it. Moreover, the deeper its cultivation, the dense the demonic qi was.The condensed demonic qi that soared into the sky from that far away mountain proved without a doubt that an extremely formidable greater demon resided there. As for its strength, even Ji Yu was unable to precisely determine it, let alone Chen Xi.\u201cHmm?\u201d As if he had noticed something, Ji Yu knit his brows together. After remaining silent for a short moment, his brows eased up and his expression returned to normal, then he said, \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve indeed run into a perilous place where demon beasts wreak havoc.\u201d As he spoke, his body shook slightly before vanishing.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 actually\u2026 a human!\u201dBefore Chen Xi could even wrap his head around what Ji Yu meant, a rough voice suddenly echoed out in the distance. The speech of the voice was choppy as if the owner had only just learned how to speak.The place Chen Xi stood at was the side of the precipitous cliff at the top of the mountain surrounded by mist and clouds that coiled around it, and behind him was instead a rocky area that was bumpy.At this moment, a black clothed young man with a hideous appearance and a strong stature stood there in the rocky area, and his pair of shiny jade eyes emitted an undisguised expression of atrociousness and ruthlessness.\u201cCongenital Realm greater demon?\u201dChen Xi had once killed numerous Congenital Realm greater demons within the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range and had stopped being ignorant since a long time ago. Thus, he discerned the identity of the black clothed young man with almost a single glance.\u201cOh, it\u2019s a human as expected. I, Mu Kui have cultivated for almost 1,000 years, yet it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve encountered a human. I heard the texture of human flesh is nice and tender. I wonder if it\u2019s true?\u201d The black clothed young man who called himself Mu Kui muttered to himself, and the more he spoke, the more excited he became. He even occasional extended out his scarlet red tongue to lick his mouth, revealing a mouthful of densely cold and sharp teeth.\u201cWant to eat me? A demon beast is a demon beast after all. Even if it has taken human form, it\u2019s still difficult to change the bloodthirsty desires imprinted within its bones.\u201d Chen Xi shook his head. The tip of his feet instantly stepped on the ground, utilizing the Heavenly Dragon\u2019s Eight Steps, his body was like a cheetah that dove out towards Mu Kui in a brazen attack.Mu Kui never imagined that Chen Xi would attack at will, and he\u2019d only just slightly panicked when Chen Xi had already closed the distance between the two of them.Bang!An extremely simple explosive fist struck out to instantly blast Mu Kui flying. However, before his body could even hit the floor, Chen Xi had once again stomped on the ground to follow up before bending his elbow upwards and swinging his arm down, and his fist was like a drill as it hammered downwards.BANG!Mu Kui was directly smashed into the hard rocky ground, his body sunk deep into the ground, and streams of darkish red blood even flowed out of the corners of his mouth.Whoosh!Chen Xi raised his fist once more.\u201cStop, stop! I admit defeat! I beg you, Senior, spare my life! Spare me!\u201d Mu Kui screamed in fear, yet an expression of rage and ruthlessness slipped past deep within his eyes.Chen Xi sneered incessantly in his heart. He completely disregarded Mu Kui imploring for mercy as he continuously smashed his fist downwards another few tens of times. Every single punch was a full force strike, smashing onto Mu Kui to the point his flesh broke apart and numerous bones of his had already broken.For a time, the entire peak of the mountain was filled with the shrill wailing of Mu Kui begging for mercy, and his voice was incomparably miserable to the point it would cause one\u2019s countenance to change.Not long after, Chen Xi gazed at Mu Kui who was on the verge of death, and asked coldly, \u201cNow, do you still want to eat me?\u201dActually, he didn\u2019t have a heart of stone, nor did his feelings towards demon beasts come to the extent that he would spare none on sight. But, this Mu Kui was extremely cunning. When he admitted defeat the first time, it was obviously an act to deceive Chen Xi. If Chen Xi didn\u2019t beat him to the point that fear was born within his heart, there was no telling what would happen.The world of demon beasts was actually even more barbaric than the world of humans, and the law of survival where the strong were respected had always been carried out from within their bones. The person with the biggest fist was the one who was boss, and they completely didn\u2019t care about reason.\u201cI don\u2019t dare, I don\u2019t dare. This lowly one has eyes but didn\u2019t recognize Mt.Tai. I hope Senior can pardon my offense.\u201d Mu Kui\u2019s tone revealed reverence and terror. His face was completely red and swollen from being hit by Chen Xi, and his originally hideous appearance had become an even more agonizing sight.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll ask you some things. If you\u2019re able to answer it to my satisfaction, then I\u2019ll let you go. Right, get up first.\u201d Chen Xi had his hands behind his back as he spoke.Mu Kui did his best to struggle off the ground and stand up, then he held back the intense pain in his entire body as he nodded repeatedly. \u201cOf course, of course. This lowly one guarantees to speak without reserve, and will surely make Senior satisfied.\u201d\u201cWhere is this?\u201d\u201cReporting to Senior. This place is within the 10,000 enormous mountains of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range. This mountain is called Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, and it\u2019s the place I cultivate.\u201d Mu Kui really did speak without reserve, and he replied in an extremely straightforward manner.\u201cOh, do you know how to leave this place?\u201d Chen Xi expression remained unfazed as he continued to ask, causing one to be unable to perceive his true thoughts within his heart.When this appearance entered the eyes of Mu Kui, Chen Xi seemed to become unfathomable, and he was even more certain inwardly that Chen Xi was a human expert that had entered this place by mistake.However, Chen Xi\u2019s second question still caused Mu Kui to be unable to avoid being stunned, and he said in shock. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Senior know how he came here?\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d The displeasure within Chen Xi\u2019s voice caused Mu Kui to shudder in fear, but he still had a face full of difficulty as he answered. \u201cSenior, this lowly one has been cultivating here since childhood. This lowly one has not left 500km from Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain in these 1,000 years at all. Even this lowly one is unable to answer this question.\u201d\u201cAlright, you may leave.\u201d Chen Xi pondered for a short moment before waving his hand in dismissal.Mu Kui couldn\u2019t help but be stunned. Mu Kui was in slight disbelief and for a time, he didn\u2019t know what to do.It was at this moment that a deep and powerful voice was like a struck drum as it resounded out from the foot of the mountain. \u201cMu Kui, you kid! I\u2019ll surely kill you today! Hurry up and get your ass down here for your grandfather!\u201dThe sound was so loud that bangs echoed out explosively all over the entire Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.\u201cI\u2019m doomed, this fellow, Li Hu, is here again\u2026\u201d Mu Kui\u2019s expression abruptly became incomparably miserable, and he seemed as if he\u2019d been scared out of his wits.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but say curiously, \u201cIs this fellow extremely formidable?\u201dMu Kui powerlessly said with a bitter smile on his face, \u201cHe\u2019s on par with me. But how could I be a match for him in my current condition? Oh, earlier, if Senior didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you blaming me for injuring you?\u201d Chen Xi coldly interrupted.Mu Kui was shocked with terror, only now did he realize that the person beside him was an even more ruthless person than Li Hu, and he instantly explained in a hurry. \u201cSenior, calm down. This lowly one absolutely didn\u2019t mean that. I absolutely didn\u2019t!\u201d\u201cWhy does that Li Hu want to kill you?\u201d Chen Xi was only frightening him, and when Chen Xi saw that he was so docile, Chen Xi couldn\u2019t bear to make him suffer any longer.\u201cWhat else, but to seize my cultivation abode.\u201dMu Kui gritted his teeth and said, \u201cSenior, to be honest, there\u2019s a section of a top-grade spirit vein within my abode. I don\u2019t know where that Li Hu acquired this information, so, he wants to seize my abode and cause me to have no place to dwell in anymore.\u201d\u201cWhy are you telling me all this? Could it be that you\u2019re not afraid that it will be seized by me?\u201d Chen Xi glanced at Mu Kui with a gaze that contained a profound meaning.Mu Kui knew as well that he was unable to conceal his petty shrewdness from Chen Xi, so he answered frankly. \u201cAs long as Senior is able to kill Li Hu for me, then there\u2019s no harm if this cultivation abode is gifted to Senior.\u201d\u201cThen what about you?\u201d Chen Xi compelled Mu Kui to answer completely, step by step.Mu Kui fell on his knees with a bang and ceaselessly kowtowed as he said loudly, \u201cI\u2019m willing to follow Senior, stand before Senior in protection, and become a spirit beast under Senior\u2019s command. I\u2019ll serve Senior for my entire life.\u201dChen Xi was instead stunned, as he\u2019d never imagined that Mu Kui would perform such a sacrifice.A demon beast acknowledging a master was no different from establishing a vow of the heart under the Heaven Dao. The demon beast could only follow behind its master for its entire lifetime, and its life or death was controlled by the hands of its master. Unless it was under special circumstances, there wasn\u2019t a single demon beast that would willingly do this.\u201cMu Kui, you kid! You can\u2019t hide! Hurry up and come out to receive death!\u201dThe powerful and deep voice once again echoed out with a bang, and nearby the mountainside of Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, a fiery red figure was violently dashing towards the peak of the mountain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Senior, save me!\u201d Mu Kui\u2019s expression became miserable and unsightly as he heard that voice that came closer and closer, and he kowtowed repeatedly.Chen Xi shook his head and said helplessly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get up right now, I really won\u2019t save you.\u201dMu Kui was overjoyed and once again kowtowed three times before saying with a voice that contained agitation that was difficult to hide, \u201cThank you, Senior. Thank you!\u201dIn a moment, a red robed youth leaped up the cliff. He had a pink face with lips that were smooth as jade, and he possessed an extremely handsome appearance of starry eyes and sword shaped eyebrows. Most eye catching of it all was the flame tattoo on his forehead that contained a strand of flickering flame, and it added an evil air to him.\u201cMu Kui, you kid! I never imagined that you\u2019d actually find help! But, you seem to have been injured, right?\u201d The red robed youth glanced at Chen Xi with a strange gaze, then he locked his gaze onto Mu Kui who was covered in injuries and he silently sneered unceasingly.Chen Xi was hardly able to believe his eyes, as after he\u2019d heard the powerful and deep voice, he originally thought that the even if this Li Hu had taken human form, Li Hu ought to be a burly fellow, but he never imagined that Li Hu would actually be a handsome youth!With Chen Xi backing him up, Mu Kui\u2019s had become much more courageous, and he shouted out explosively with an angry voice. \u201cLi Hu, you\u2019ve provoked me repeatedly, do you think I\u2019m afraid of you?\u201dLi Hu shook his head in disdain, then he pointed at Chen Xi and said in a deep voice, \u201cKid, I advise you to leave as soon as possible. Don\u2019t get yourself injured because of Mu Kui. Grandpa is a perfection-stage Congenital Realm Blaze Tiger greater demon. Killing you is like slaughtering a chicken. Hurry up and fuck off!\u201d\u201cAudacious! You actually dared insult Senior? You, stupid tiger, are really courting death! Let me tell you, today, just because of what you just said, you, Li Hu, are dead for sure!\u201d Mu Kui shouted out explosively and was about to charge forward.\u201cAllow me.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s calm and indifferent voice sounded out and it carried with it irresistible air, and Mu Kui\u2019s heart went cold for no reason. He moved back right away and stood respectfully at the side, and when he recalled his miserable encounter from before, the gaze he shot at Li Hu already carried a trace of pity.Step!Chen Xi took a step forward, and along with this step, his entire temperament suddenly changed. Dense killing intent was abruptly emitted from his thin and tall body, like a sharp sword that thirsted for blood had been drawn from its sheath.Hiss!Mu Kui gasped, and he suddenly realized.\u201cKid, who the heck are you? Quickly speak your name!?\u201dThe unparalleled killing intent that suddenly surged out from Chen Xi\u2019s body caused Li Hu to be shocked in his heart, and he knew he\u2019d encountered a formidable opponent, so he decided to sound Chen Xi out.A trace of pity arose in Chen Xi\u2019s heart, and the killing intent in his chest instead became thicker and thicker.Chen Xi\u2019s grandfather, Chen Tianli, had always been a taboo in Chen Xi\u2019s heart, and Li Hu calling himself grandpa at every moment had undoubtedly provoked and offended Chen Xi\u2019s bottom line.\u201cCut off your own tongue and I\u2019ll spare your life,\u201d Chen Xi said coldly.\u201cYou\u2019re actually more arrogant than Grandpa Li Hu, you\u2019re truly courting death!\u201d Li Hu burst into rage, the demonic qi on his body suffused out with a bang, and eyes were incomparably blackish red as if they were filled with blood.Whoosh!Under the influence of his explosive rage, Li Hu decided to make the first move and gain the advantage. On his hands that were big like fans, the nails on his fingers grew out explosively to become 60 cm long, and they were like 10 sharp sword blades that were suffused with a bloody glow. Then, his body leaped out to claw towards Chen Xi.Rip!As he dashed, the red robe on Li Hu\u2019s body tore into pieces that fluttered in the air, revealing his upper body that was covered in curved and strong muscles that were like rocks, and his aura explosively increased a level as well.Chen Xi\u2019s eyes lit up. This was the first time he\u2019d encountered a body refining greater demon, and the battle intent within his heart was instantly lit ablaze. Immediately, he didn\u2019t utilize his True Essence any longer as he charged straight at Li Hu.Bang! Bang! Bang!Chen Xi and Li Hu were locked in battle, the Grand Collapsing Fist that was at the unity-stage was exerted to the limit by Chen Xi as he used a purely head-on method to battle Li Hu.He moved like a drawn bow to explode out like a thunderclap!Chen Xi\u2019s body was like a large bow that had been drawn fully, and the terrifying strength beneath his muscles and skin were gathered at every joint in his body. When he smashed out his fist, it was like a violently shot arrow, like muffled thunder exploding out.The \u2018collapsing\u2019 within the Grand Collapsing Fist was fully utilized by him, as the formidable strength of his body surged out from his fist to quake the space to the point that circle after circle of ripples that were noticeable to the naked eye had undulated out!Whereas Li Hu, although he was at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm as well, his martial techniques were simple and crude, and they had barely reached the advanced-stage. However, he was a Blaze Tiger and his body was innately extremely strong, and what he cultivated after taking human form was also the School of Fiendgod Body Refinement. So, in terms of the level of strength of the body, he wasn\u2019t inferior to Chen Xi in the slightest.It was precisely because of this that although Li Hu was forced to retreat continuously, it was impossible for Chen Xi to defeat him in a short amount of time.\u201cThe body refinement cultivation of this senior is too shocking. That Li Hu is a tiger demon that innately possesses a strong body, yet he\u2019s been beaten to the point he\u2019d unable to hit back. Moreover, if their martial techniques were compared, the fist technique of this senior is extremely formidable as well, and has obviously attained the unity-stage\u2026\u201dIn the distance, extraordinary splendor rippled in Mu Kui\u2019s eyes as he watched the battle, and the deeper he understood Chen Xi\u2019s strength, the more reverence he felt in his heart towards Chen Xi. He\u2019d already inwardly decided that no matter what, he would stay by Chen Xi\u2019s side!\u201cHow is this possible? I\u2019ve already cultivated this body refinement technique for over 1,000 years, and I\u2019m only a step away from advancing to the Violet Palace Realm to become a demon king. How could I be forced to continuously retreat one step after another?\u201d Li Hu\u2019s expression became more and more serious, as every fist that Chen Xi struck out would quake his body to the point his vital energy and blood roiled, and the bones in his entire body ached extremely as well. This sort of feeling was so unfamiliar, unfamiliar to the point it caused him to be incomparably aggrieved.Roar!A violent and fierce roar exploded out with a bang atop the mountain peak, and Li Hu\u2019s body slightly swayed before he\u2019d already transformed into an enormous tiger that was 6m long and 3m tall. Li Hu\u2019s fangs were like sabers, his enormous claws like swords, and savage and raging demonic qi suffused out with a bang from his body that was coiled in blazing flames.\u201cHow many years has it been? You\u2019re the first person to force out my original form. I\u2019ll let you die a swift death!\u201d Li Hu roared into the sky.Whoosh!His entire figure was like a wisp of flames as he pounced towards Chen Xi with a speed that was actually more than double from before!\u201cSenior, watch out!\u201d Mu Kui shouted out loudly from afar. \u201cAfter Li Hu\u2019s returned to his body of a demon beast, his strength had at least risen explosively by 20%!\u201dChen Xi instead sighed inwardly. The head on battle with Li Hu earlier had allowed his comprehension towards his fist technique to deepen, and his Grand Collapsing Fist that remained at a standstill at the unity-stage even had a faint trace of being about to break through. But he never expected that at this critical moment, Li Hu had instead transformed into a demon beast and changed the method of the battle, and this naturally caused him to feel slight regret.\u201cDie!\u201d Accompanied by the furious voice, Li Hu had already appeared before Chen Xi, and he opened his bloody mouth to fiercely bite towards Chen Xi\u2019s head!Chen Xi took a deep breath and didn\u2019t restrain his strength any longer, under the urging of his body, his fist faintly emitted a mysterious energy that caused one\u2019s heart to palpitate.Ancient, desolate, icy\u2026 Since he\u2019d attained the perfection-stage of the Congenital realm, and some mysterious veins of shaman markings had vaguely appeared on his back, Chen Xi noticed that when he utilized the Grand Collapsing Fist purely with the strength of his body, strands of a mysterious energy would surge out from between his flesh and skin. This energy was fine like strands of hair and was incomparably scarce. If he didn\u2019t carefully sense it, he would be utterly unable to notice it.Shaman Energy!It was recorded on the Universe Starslayer Body Forging Arts that when the body is refined to the Violet Palace Realm, shaman markings and star diagrams would be condensed, and a terrifying and mysterious energy called Shaman Energy would surge out from within the entire body.Similar to the True Essence that was cultivated by qi refiners, along with the increase in cultivation, the Shaman Energy would undergo a qualitative transformation. Shaman Energy was used to execute the Divine Abilities that could only be cultivated by body refiners at the Violet Palace Realm, and it was able to display an unimaginable destructive force!Bang!Chen Xi lowered his head and move his body sideway, dodging the bite of Li Hu\u2019s bloody mouth with a speed that was swift as lightning, and at the same time his right arm turned around and a punch rushed out like lightning.Pu!Chen Xi\u2019s right fist directly broke open Li Hu\u2019s lower jaw, then his fist easily made a hole through Li Hu\u2019s head from bottom to top, leaving behind a hole that surged with blood.\u201cAh!\u201d Dark red and thick blood flew out in the air above the side of the cliff, tainting the drifting sea clouds in red. Whereas Li Hu instead emitted a miserable and suffering shrill cry, and he was directly thrown out a few hundred meters with a swing of Chen Xi\u2019s arm. Li Hu then struggled for a short moment but was unable to stand up once again, and he died just like that.It seemed slow when written out, but in actuality, from the moment Li Hu transformed into his body of a demon beast until Chen Xi broke open his head with a single punch, only an instant had passed. However, within this instant, Li Hu was already dead on the ground.Mu Kui\u2019s pupils went wide, and he nearly thought he was seeing this. But when he saw the body of Li Hu who had died miserably in a pool of blood, he affirmed that everything that had happened was real!Mu Kui recalled the scene of Chen Xi beating the daylights out of him from before, a cold stream of air poured out of his vertebrae into his entire body, and he couldn\u2019t help but shudder.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d After removing a storage belt from Li Hu\u2019s corpse, Chen Xi turned around and walked down the mountain.\u201cOh!\u201d Mu Kui abruptly jolted awake and hurriedly jogged to follow up to Chen Xi, and his gaze when he looked at Chen Xi\u2019s back carried boundless reverence within it.\u201cRight, Li Hu is a Blaze Tiger, what about you?\u201d\u201cReporting to Senior, this lowly one is a Winged Silverwolf.\u201d\u201cOh, I heard that Winged Silverwolves possess a strand of the bloodline of the divine beast of ancient times, the Lunarwood Wolf. Is it true?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 It\u2019s true indeed. But the bloodline of this lowly one is mixed to a great extent. My father was an Azurewing Windwolf, and my mother was a Winged Silverwolf, so, I\u2019m unsure if I possess the bloodline inheritance of the Lunarwood Wolf.\u201d\u201cOh, so you\u2019re a cross breed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut, you gave yourself the name Mu Kui[1. Mu Kui\u2019s name (\u6728\u594e) and the Lunarwood Wolf (\u594e\u6728\u72fc) utilize the same characters but in an inverse order.], I presume that you desire extremely to possess formidable strength like the Lunarwood Wolf, right?\u201d\u201cSenior really possesses an insightful gaze that\u2019s like a torch, it truly causes this lowly one to have extreme admiration. The admiration within my heart is like a surging river\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThey chatted all along the way, and under the lead of Mu Kui, Chen Xi quickly followed along the winding mountain path to circle around for almost the time for an incense stick to burn before finally arriving before Mu Kui\u2019s abode.This abode was situated in an extremely hidden pavement on the mountain side. On one side was a precipice, and the other side was tightly curtained by numerous large trees that were like coiled dragons and required many people to form a circle around it. If it wasn\u2019t for Mu Kui leading the way, it was truly difficult to notice.\u201cSenior, please enter.\u201d Mu Kui stood before the abode and bowed in welcome.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 Continuous Pleasant SurprisesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63 \u2013 Continuous Pleasant SurprisesMu Kui\u2019s abode covered no more than 30 meters of space. Its inner environment was cool and dry with some tables and chairs made of halogen salts placed around casually, and the entire abode seemed extremely simple.The moment he entered the abode, Chen Xi noticed a dense spirit energy fluctuation. He swept his soul out and quickly found the source of the fluctuation.At the corner of the abode was a meditation cushion. Chen Xi stretched out his hand to lift the meditation cushion and saw a chunk of jade stone that emitted a misty bright light silently lying within the crack in the rock. It was around 30c long and thick like a baby\u2019s arm. The spirit energy emitted from it was thick and pure, and taking a slight breath would cause one\u2019s mind to feel refreshed.\u201cThis is the top-grade spirit vein you spoke of? No wonder that tiger demon wanted to seize your abode, the spirit energy here is more than 10 times denser than the outside world. It\u2019s undoubtedly a superb place to cultivate.\u201d Chen Xi said in amazement. It was the first time he\u2019d seen the appearance of a spirit vein, but compared to the spirit spring he\u2019d seen in the sword immortal\u2019s abode, this chunk of spirit vein was rather inferior.Mu Kui stood at the side and was uneasy in his heart. Killing one and seizing their treasures wasn\u2019t something he hadn\u2019t seen before, so he was naturally worried that greed would arise in Chen Xi\u2019s heart and he would wipe him out.Thump!The more he thought about it, the more afraid he felt, Mu Kui didn\u2019t dare hesitate any longer and instantly knelt on the ground before saying loudly, \u201cThis lowly one is willing to take Senior as my Master. I earnestly request Senior to keep my by your side, and Mu Kui will only serve Senior for his entire lifetime. If I violate this oath, then I\u2019ll surely encounter the punishment of the Heaven\u2019s Dao, and be unable to achieve rebirth, forever!\u201dChen Xi knew that this fellow was afraid that Chen Xi would kill him and seize his treasures, so Chen Xi knew that if he were to refuse Mu Kui, it would surely cause Mu Kui to live in uncertainty forever, and perhaps some unexpected event may occur because of this.Chen Xi pondered for a moment before nodding and saying, \u201cAlright, I can accept your request, but let me state something first, I won\u2019t bring you along to leave this place.\u201d\u201cSenior, Mu Kui sincerely wants to follow Senior. This lowly one will absolutely not divert Senior\u2019s attention to take care of me, please fulfill my request, Senior.\u201d Mu Kui felt slightly safe in his heart, but when he thought of the second half of what Chen Xi said, he couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly reluctant and said to himself.Chen Xi shook his head. \u201cI won\u2019t change my decision, if you persist in this way, then\u2026\u201dBefore Chen Xi could even finish speaking, Mu Kui had said in a hurry, \u201cSenior, calm your anger. We\u2019ll do it according to what Senior said.\u201dChen Xi nodded.Mu Kui continued to chat with Chen Xi, he originally wanted to find out about Chen Xi\u2019s background, but when he saw Chen Xi seemed to have his mind occupied with other things, he instantly left in an extremely obedient manner.This abode was silently seized by Chen Xi, but Mu Kui thought nothing of it, as he was already extremely grateful that Chen Xi didn\u2019t kill him after all.\u2026Hu~Chen Xi sat on the meditation cushion, and the pure and thick spirit energy that surged out from the top-grade spirit vein below him caused him to be unable to refrain from exhaling in comfort.\u201cThis place isn\u2019t bad.\u201d Ji Yu held the infant Pixiu in his arms as he appeared out of thin air.Chen Xi was already used to Ji Yu coming and going like a shadow and knew that Ji Yu would only come out and meet him when there was no one around.Roar!The eyes of the snow white and fluffy Pixiu that was only the size of a fist lit up, then it roared towards the place Chen Xi was sitting. Obviously, it had noticed the chunk of top-grade spirit vein.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but stretch out his hand when he saw the little fellow had such a cute appearance and wanted to embrace it, but was flatly refused by Ji Yu. \u201cYou current strength is still unable to suppress Bai Kui, and would just let him run away.\u201d\u201cBai Kui?\u201d Chen Xi was stunned.\u201cYes, he\u2019s called Bai Kui. He already possesses intelligence and was born with a spirit body. But as an auspicious beast that\u2019s well-renowned since ancient times, he\u2019s forever unable to take human form.\u201dJi Yu said emotionally, \u201cThis is the Heaven Dao, it harms those who have too much and supplements those that don\u2019t. If a Pixiu is able to take human form and cultivate, then relying on its terrifying ability to accumulate Karmic Luck, then sooner or later, it would probably become a supreme existence.\u201d\u201cHarms those who have too much and supplements those that don\u2019t?\u201d Chen Xi was extremely puzzled. The Heaven Dao was extremely profound and difficult to ascertain. How could he understand the meaning within the Heaven\u2019s Dao with his current scope of vision?\u201cWhat do you plan to do? Want to stay here forever?\u201d Ji Yu changed the topic.When the matter at hand was mentioned, Chen Xi\u2019s expression seemed much more serious as he nodded and said, \u201cYes, I heard from Mu Kui that seven demon kings with terrifying forces under their command occupy this deep area of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, and are like impenetrable walls that are defending the places that must be passed to head to the outside world. So I want to temporarily stay here and leave once my cultivation has broken through to the Violet Palace Realm.\u201dWhen they chatter earlier, Mu Kui wanted to find out about Chen Xi\u2019s identity, but Chen Xi instead changed the topic with just a few words and made Mu Kui reveal various secrets. This also allowed Chen Xi to have a certain degree of understanding towards this area where groups of mountains flowed on continuously.The Southern Barbaric Mountain Range had a domain of 5,000km, and the central area occupied 2,500km of it. Demon beasts moved about freely and wreaked havoc in this central area, and amongst these demon beasts, the seven great demon kings held the greatest reputation.These seven great demon kings were respectively the Copper Mountain\u2019s Thunderhawk King, Aqua Cavern\u2019s Black Ape King, Moonlight Lake\u2019s Dark Wyrm King, Sunset Forest\u2019s Azure Python King, Moonhowl Ridge\u2019s Roc King, Coldstar Mountain\u2019s Nine-tailed Fox King, and the elusive Profound-vision Old Turtle King.There were differences between the strength of these seven demon kings, on the lower spectrum was the Aqua Cavern\u2019s Black Ape King who was only at the Violet Palace Realm, and on the higher end of the spectrum was the Moonhowl Ridge\u2019s Roc King and the Coldstar Mountain\u2019s Nine-tailed Fox King who almost no demon knew how formidable their cultivations were.Of course, the most mysterious was still the Profound-vision Old Turtle King. Allegedly, this Old Turtle King had already lived for over 10,000 years and possessed a trace of the bloodline of the ancient divine beast overlord, the Black Turtle, and his strength is unfathomable.The reason that he was called mysterious is that practically no demon had seen him battle, moreover, his whereabouts changed like how the direction of the wind changed. Unless he was willing, otherwise, no one was able to meet him.However, no matter if it was the stronger or weaker amongst the seven great demon kings, they were all formidable existences that Chen Xi was currently unable to go against. It was precisely because of this that he didn\u2019t dare rashly leave Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain and go around the surroundings of this central area of the mountain range that was controlled by the seven great demon kings. If he were to venture through forcefully, he would only die miserably under the fangs of the seven demon kings.Ji Yu nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s good as well. Although demon beasts wreak havoc in this deep area of the mountain range and traces of humans are rare, the spirit energy of heaven and earth is extremely dense. Moreover, various spirit herbs and natural treasures grow here, seeming to be a treasure ground of nature. Cultivating here is extremely good as well.\u201dThey continued talking for some time longer, and after he instructed Chen Xi to cultivate properly and not waste time, Ji Yu held the infant Pixiu in his arms as he disappeared.Thump!Ji Yu had only just left when Chen Xi withdrew the jade slips he acquired in the sword immortal\u2019s abode from his storage ring, then arranged them on the ground.There were a total of 20 jade slips, and they were personally picked by Ji Yu in the Book Reserve Hall, so they were naturally existences that were extremely precious.Amongst these, 13 were talisman crafting jade slips, and 7 were other jade slips.The Dao of Talismans was vast and profound like a sea of mist, it required a long time to study and comprehend, and it was extremely difficult to achieve anything within a short amount of time.Chen Xi shot his gaze at the other seven jade slips.Qi refinement cultivation technique, Ice Crane Technique, records the technique to cultivate the nine levels in the Violet Palace Realm. The True Essence that\u2019s produced from cultivating this technique is like a surging tide filled with icicles. Not only does it stretch continuously and unbroken, it also possessed a sharp edge effect, and was extremely marvelous.\u201cMy Chen Clan\u2019s Violet Sky Arts 18 levels merely records the cultivation technique for the nine levels of the Postnatal Realm and Congenital Realm, yet it doesn\u2019t contain the technique for the Violet Palace Realm. This Ice Crane Technique just happens to solve my imminent need.\u201d Chen Xi hastily read over the Ice Crane Technique, and he looked at the absolutely ingenious qi refinement technique that exceeded his imagination, a wisp of gratefulness abruptly surged out from Chen Xi\u2019s heart and he said to himself,The second jade slip \u2014 Windflow Divination Sword.The sword technique was swift like lightning with a myriad of transformations, like the wind that whistled through the heavens and earth. When the sword was swung out, it was like a storm howling with rage and swept away all obstacles in its way. Whereas when it was used to defend, even wind couldn\u2019t pass through it\u2026 At the same time, when the sword technique was cultivated to the limit, the swung sword was swift like a gale, soft like a breeze, violent like a storm, fierce like a squall, and sharp like a hurricane\u2026 It possessed a myriad of transformations, causing its opponents to be unable to defend against it.According to the characteristics of the wind, the Windflow Divination Sword was divided into six moves, the Galeflash Shadow, Breezy Rain, Dark Storm, Tide Squall, Wavesplit Hurricane, and Space Shattering Typhoon.\u201cFormidable! This Windflow Divination Sword\u2019s first four moves are all at the level of the unity-stage, and most unbelievable are that the Wavesplit Hurricane and Space Shattering Typhoon actually already possesses the essence of the profound meaning of the Dao!\u201dChen Xi was full of excitement as he read it, and his eyes were unusually brilliant.As everyone knew, the stages of techniques were divided to the basic-stage, advanced-stage, and unity stage, whereas above it was Dao Insight!Once this stage was achieved, regardless of if it was sword technique, saber technique, spear technique, footwork, fist technique; or even flower arrangement, painting, music, and other techniques, they would all contain the cultivator's comprehension of the Grand Dao. When these techniques were utilized, the might of the techniques were more than 100 times stronger than the unity-stage. Although the two stages were divided by a single step, its difference was as great as the distance between the heavens and the earth!For example in sword techniques, when Dao Insight was comprehended, one would be able to condense Sword Insight, and the might of the sword technique would have a qualitative difference from an ordinary sword technique.\u201cDao Insight! This Windflow Divination Sword is probably an extremely precious existence within the Book Reserve Hall. Senior Ji Yu is so good to me\u2026\u201d Chen Xi took a deep breath and forcefully restrained the excitement in his heart before continuing to look at the next jade slip.Movement technique \u2014 Divine Windwing Flight, using the wind as wings to arrogantly howl in the nine heavens!This Divine Windwing Flight was boundlessly profound as well. After experiencing the pleasant surprise from before, Chen Xi had already become numbed. But when he saw this profound movement technique that was able to allow cultivators to mount the clouds and ride the mist to roam freely in the sky, he still couldn\u2019t stop himself from getting excited and he only calmed down after quite a long while.Godly Illusion, God Shaker, God Killer. These three jade slips recorded soul attack techniques, moreover, according to Chen Xi\u2019s inference, these three jade slips were obviously three parts of a whole, going up level by level from the lowest Godly Illusion to the highest God Killer.Similarly, these three soul attack techniques were techniques that Chen Xi required urgently. According to his knowledge, visualization techniques to cultivate the soul were extremely rare, and even though these soul attack techniques weren\u2019t as precious as visualization techniques, they were still extremely precious existences that ordinary powers were utterly unable to possess.When Chen Xi\u2019s gaze descended on the last jade slip, he couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.Chen Xi picked it up and skimmed through it hastily, and Chen Xi\u2019s heart that was almost numbed after being ravaged by wave after wave of pleasant surprise had once again failed him and started thumping.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When successfully cultivated, not only would he be able to restrain the aura in his entire body, his figure would become transparent and disappear as if he\u2019d vanished into thin air.Most worthy of attention was that after the Traceless Aura Technique was executed, unless it was a cultivator whose soul possessed Divine Sense, it would be utterly impossible for the cultivator to notice any traces of him. Furthermore, Divine Sense was an ability that only a great Rebirth Realm cultivator was able to acquire!However, this Traceless Aura Technique could only be utilized in a motionless state. Once he moved he would be completely exposed, and this flaw caused Chen Xi to feel it was a real shame.As far as he was concerned, if he was able to utilize the Traceless Aura Technique while dashing, he would be completely capable of leaving the depths of the mountain range unnoticed, and it would be unlikely for him to be killed by one of the seven great demon kings.In short, possessing the Traceless Aura Technique to Chen Xi at his current strength was undoubtedly like an extra life saving method; it was also a great weapon that could be used to conduct ambushes and surprise attacks!\u201cThe lowest requirement to cultivate these jade slips is the Violet Palace Realm. Looks like I must break through in my qi refinement cultivation to the Violet Palace Realm\u2026\u201dChen Xi pondered for a short while, then put away the jade slips on the floor. He withdrew the octagonal containment bottle from his storage ring, then placed the Icesoul Heartlotus beside the chunk of top-grade spirit vein beneath the meditation cushion.The Icesoul Heartlotus was a treasure used to suppress inner demons during cultivation, and at the instant it appeared it started emitted strands of energy that caused one\u2019s heart to calm.Within this calm atmosphere, Chen Xi\u2019s excited mood gradually returned to peace.Not only did the octagonal containment bottle contain almost 250kg of liquid condensed from Netherezim Baleful Qi, there was still nearly 1,500kg of spirit liquid. These spirit liquids were gathered from the Hundred Herb Hall in the sword immortal\u2019s abode, and if it wasn\u2019t for the maturing of the Goldsoul Divine Lotus completely absorbing the spirit spring, the spirit liquid Chen Xi would have been able to gather would be much greater than 1,500 kg.However, these spirit liquids were already sufficient to sustain his cultivation for an extremely long time.Whoosh!The octagonal containment bottle suddenly flew mid-air and the mouth of the bottle tipped, pouring out spirit liquid like a column as Chen Xi opened his mouth and swallowed it.Spirit liquids were used by Violet Palace Realm cultivators that had established their Dao Foundation or cultivators above the Violet Palace Realm. At this moment, Chen Xi was instead using it to charge into the Violet Palace Realm, and this was undoubtedly a risky action.Nevertheless, Chen Xi was unable to care about all that any longer. When situated in the extremely dangerous depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range where demon beasts wreaked havoc, only by swiftly increasing his strength would he be able to have a better chance at survival!Bang! Bang! Bang!When the spirit liquid was ingested, an enormous sound like a great river surging forward resounded out within Chen Xi\u2019s body. The surging and pure spirit liquid was like a fierce beast on a rampage as it started to rage about within all of his meridians. Everywhere it passed, it was like countless little knives fiercely scraped every meridian and every aperture, causing intense pain throughout his entire body.Chen Xi emitted a muffled groan as he forcefully endured the pain and gritted his teeth as he circulated the Violet Sky Arts.Fortunately, the strength of his soul was sufficiently strong and was quickly able to lead the spirit liquid current to follow along the meridians in his body to complete a circulation revolution. After completing 36 revolutions, all the spirit liquids were injected into his Dantian.At this moment, his Dantian wasn\u2019t peaceful as it used to be. The nine True Essence clouds that originally assumed a ladder shape to rise straight up seemed as if they were stirred by an enormous hand and they fiercely fluttered about within his Dantian, absorbing the True Essence that had surged within.The process of absorbing took three days!Three days and almost 500kg of spirit liquids later, the volume of the nine True Essence clouds had expanded 10 plus times and they were like fermented dough as they blocked up the Dantian, unable to move another bit.Chen Xi didn\u2019t stop cultivating and still absorbed streams of spirit liquids that continued to charge into his Dantian after being refined by his Violet Sky Arts.Crack! Crack! Crack!After spirit energy ceaselessly surging in and fiercely assaulting it, Chen Xi\u2019s Dantian that had been completely filled started to faintly bulge, as if it would break open in the next moment.Right at that moment.Chen Xi\u2019s eyes abruptly sprung open and cold light revolved within his eyes as he shouted. \u201cOpen!\u201d\u2026Outside the abode, Mu Kui was meditating beneath a large tree and he seemed to have noticed something as he raised his head abruptly. The scene that entered his eyes was that of all the spirit energy of heaven and earth throughout the entire Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain seeming as if they had been summoned, as they swarmed into the abode. For a time, fierce gales sprung up and storms surged at a shocking scale.\u201cDrawing upon the spirit energy of the heaven and the earth?\u201d Mu Kui\u2019s eyes lit up suddenly, then he said in agitation, \u201cCould it be that Senior Chen Xi is about to develop his violet palace?\u201d\u2026\u201cHmm?\u201d 5,000km away, within a precipitous mountain that was like a sharp sword piercing the sky, a black robed and white haired young man sat on a jade bed as he drank excellent wine. Beside him, a beautiful female demon massaged his legs, and he had an incomparably pleased expression.However, he seemed to have noticed something as he suddenly stood up and the white bone wine cup in his hand shattered on the floor with a crash. He seemed as if he didn\u2019t notice it in the slightest as he muttered to himself. \u201cWho would be charging towards the Violet Palace Realm within my territory? It\u2019s impossible. Not a single one of those little fellows possesses the strength to charge into the Violet Palace Realm. Could it be a fellow daoist from another place?\u201d\u201cMy King, have you noticed something?\u201d The beautiful female demon asked carefully.The black robed white haired young man waved his hand and said, \u201cGo look for my disciple Li Hu. Ask him if any other demon-kind fellow daoists have been lingering nearby.\u201d\u201cYes, my King.\u201d The beautiful female demon smiled sweetly before transforming into a white feathered spirit bird and spreading her wings to fly out the abode.\u2026The violent fluctuation of the spirit energy of heaven and earth on Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain had already drawn the attention of numerous greater demons that were devoted to cultivation nearby. They either stuck their heads out from the water, looked far into the distance from the peak of a tree or walked out from their abodes\u2026 and their gazes congregated on the same place in unison: Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.\u201cCould it be that fellow Mu Kui?\u201d\u201cNo, I fucking remember that stupid wolf had only just advanced to the perfection stage of the Congenital Realm.\u201d\u201cThis might in the air is absolutely the development of the violet palace, without a doubt!\u201d\u201cIf he\u2019s successful in developing his violet palace, then Aqua Cavern\u2019s Black Ape King will probably be threatened.\u201dIt was either surprise, bewilderment, or worry that surged out within the heart of every greater demon, but no matter what, the gazes they shot at Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain faintly carried a trace of reverence.\u2026Bang!Within the abode, Chen Xi felt the hairs on his body abruptly rise up and his Dantian felt as if it was fiercely struck by thunder, causing his soul to start trembling as well.A terrifying energy of heaven and earth suffused into the air.Kacha!A tiny sound like a shell breaking sounded. It was like the beginning of the world, though more like a phoenix rising from the ashes. Chen Xi felt like his entire body had been washed by clear spring water. His body was clear of impurities and his mind was clear.Violet Palace Realm!Chen Xi forcefully restrained the excitement in his heart as he viewed his own body internally. His Dantian had already transformed into a space that was a hundred times more spacious than before, and a lake of True Essence rippled within, seeming extremely mysterious.Chen Xi was shocked to notice that at the center of the lake, the Goldsoul Lotus Fruit that was completely coiled in golden lights floated there, and it actually wasn\u2019t affected by his recent breakthrough in the slightest.Shaking his head, Chen Xi didn\u2019t hesitate any longer and recalled the Ice Crane Technique in his mind before carefully savoring the profound meaning within it.The development of the violet palace was the establishing of the foundation of the Grand Dao, and only then was one considered to have truly stepped onto the road to the Dao of Immortality. At this moment, his cultivation was extremely unstable. If he didn\u2019t have a Violet Palace Realm cultivation technique to use, it could even cause his Dao Foundation to be devastated!In the Violet Palace Realm, every increase in level would cause a star condensed from True Essence to emerge in the Dantian, and when nine stars were chained together, it was considered the perfection stage of the Violet Palace Realm.What Chen Xi needed to do now was to condense a star from True Essence and make his cultivation stabilize completely.Splash!Merely around 1,000 kg of spirit liquid remained within the octagonal containment bottle, yet Chen Xi wasn\u2019t sparing in the slightest. After he\u2019d confirmed every detail of the Ice Crane Technique and mastered it in his heart, he opened his mouth once again and absorbed some spirit liquid before starting to cultivate.The Ice Crane Technique was divided into nine levels, recording the cultivation method from the 1st star of the Violet Palace Realm until the 9th star of the Violet Palace Realm. It was alternatively named the Ice Crane\u2019s Nine Transformations and every transformation was able to condense a True Essence star.Another six hours passed.After circulating 81 revolutions according to the pathways of the 1st transformation of the Ice Crane Technique, the True Essence throughout Chen Xi\u2019s body had completely changed.The violet colored True Essence that he\u2019d condensed from the Violet Sky Arts had now become a clear and bright silver color. It was like frost crystals that were extremely beautiful.Moreover, the True Essence was continuously cold with overflowing with vigor, and as it flowed between the meridians it seemed like a wriggling ice flood dragon that was moving swiftly.Chen Xi opened his eyes, bent his elbows and struck his fist at the air.The fist lightly whistled out, causing an icy fist mark that was extremely striking to abruptly appear in the air wherever it passed, and the entire abode instantly became filled with cold qi.Bang!The hard wall of the abode was suffused with a layer of ice, and a deep fist print sunk into the middle of the wall.\u201cThe Ice Crane True Essence is formidable as expected, even a casual fist strike possess such might. It will surely be able to display an unexpected effect when battling an enemy!\u201d Chen Xi was extremely pleased.\u201cSenior, I wonder if this lowly one may enter?\u201d Mu Kui\u2019s voice sounded out from outside the abode.Chen Xi thought for a moment then took the initiative to walk out of the abode by himself, then he looked at Mu Kui who stood there in a bowing position and asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dMu Kui originally wanted to say something, but when his gaze descended onto Chen Xi, he felt as if he was facing an unmovable towering mountain. He was extremely shocked in his heart as he hurriedly congratulated. \u201cAh, Senior has really advanced to the Violet Palace Realm, this lowly one congratulates Senior.\u201dChen Xi frowned, \u201cIf you have something to say then say it, I don\u2019t like being flattered by others, so don\u2019t do this again in the future.\u201dMu Kui nodded repeatedly, then he deliberated for a short moment before stating the reason he came in a low voice. \u201cSenior, a few of my friends want to meet you. They\u2019re all greater demons that cultivate near Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, and when they found out that Senior broke through to the Violet Palace Realm, they especially came to congratulate Senior. I wonder if Senior is able to find the time to meet them?\u201d\u201cThe greater demons that cultivate nearby?\u201d Chen Xi was stunned, but when he noticed the uneasy expression on Mu Kui\u2019s face, he vaguely understood what was going on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t dare meet Chen Xi\u2019s eye, but he didn\u2019t feel he\u2019d done anything wrong either.Earlier, the commotion of Chen Xi drawing upon the spirit energy of the heaven and earth to develop his violet palace was extremely great. It had drawn the attention of many greater demons that were cultivating near Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, so they all came over asking Mu Kui to introduce them.These greater demons had had some friendly relations with him and they would usually gather together to drink wine and discuss the Dao. Although they weren\u2019t best friends, it still wasn\u2019t nice for Mu Kui to refuse them, so he could only summon up the courage to go see Chen Xi.Of course, Mu Kui was still quite excited in his heart. He\u2019d been cultivating for a thousand years on Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, but due him leading a solitary life and his cultivation being unable to compare with the other greater demons, practically no one would be willing to speak with him when the nearby greater demons gathered usually; they would only treat him as a dispensable fellow daoist.But now, along with Chen Xi\u2019s advancement into the Violet Palace Realm, these greater demons carried various treasures with them as they came looking for him, and all of them conversed eagerly and enthusiastically with him. Besides causing Mu Kui to feel surprised, pride couldn\u2019t help but arise in his heart.However, Mu Kui also knew clearly that if it wasn\u2019t for Senior Chen Xi\u2019s presence, these vulgar folk would probably still not look him straight in the eye.\u201cAlright.\u201d Chen Xi pondered for a moment, then agreed with a nod as he wanted to meet the nearby greater demons as well. After all, these fellows stayed here all year long and had now even become his \u2018neighbors.\u2019 Although it was difficult to be friends, they couldn\u2019t be enemies, so it was still necessary for him to maintain a certain level of relationship with them.\u201cSenior\u2026 You agree?\u201d Mu Kui simply didn\u2019t dare believe his ears as he asked in astonishment.\u201cDo you not want me to back you up?\u201d Chen Xi glanced askance at him, then said, \u201cOnly this time, and no more.\u201dMu Kui was both touched and prideful in his heart, and he nodded like a chick pecking grains, as he was excited to the point that he couldn\u2019t speak.\u2026The land was covered with green pines and verdant cypresses, with waterfalls and springs that flowed ever so beautifully. The sky was covered in a layer of mist and clouds, while cool breezes blew like a tide.In this scene that was like a painting, over ten men and women in various clothes were laughing and chatting together. They were leaning against the azure pine tree, sitting or squatting on rocks, sitting on the ground in groups of two or three, or standing upright and respectfully.\u201cThis fellow Mu Kui\u2019s luck is so good, he was actually able to make friends with a Violet Palace Realm expert. Truly a cause for envy.\u201d\u201cOh, we can only blame ourselves for neglecting him in the past. If I knew earlier, I might be able to be like him and listen to the teachings of that Senior Chen Xi.\u201d\u201cWhere do all of you think this Senior Chen Xi is from? In the last thousand years, human cultivators have rarely stepped foot into our mountain range.\u201d\u2026Various discussions resounded, and at this moment the mountainside of Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain seemed to already be a bustling scene.\u201cEh, Mu Kui is here, can it be that the youth before him is the Senior Chen Xi that just developed his violet palace Dao Foundation?\u201d Someone abruptly cried out in surprise.Whoosh!The gazes of the group of greater demons shot towards the same direction in unison.They saw Mu Kui pacing over while he followed behind a youth. The youth had a tall figure and handsome appearance, his eyes were clear and indifferent. He seemed to be absolutely ordinary, yet with every move he made, he seemed as if he\u2019d merged with the heavens and the earth and he naturally emitted a minuscule amount of an extremely formidable aura.At that moment, there was no longer a trace of doubt in the hearts of the greater demons, and even the gazes they shot at Chen Xi carried along a trace of reverence.\u201cI\u2019m the Spiritdove Mountain\u2019s Xiong Pi, I pay my respects to Senior Chen Xi!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the Basanite Cavern\u2019s Zhui Man, I pay my respects to Senior Chen Xi. I congratulate Senior on advancing to the Violet Palace Realm and establishing the foundation of the Grand Dao!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the Phoenixridge Lake\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe greater demons came forward one by one to bow and pay their respects to Chen Xi, and their expressions and words were filled with extreme respect.At the beginning, Chen Xi felt slightly uncomfortable towards all this, but he became accustomed to it later on. He only nodded in reply, yet in his heart, he\u2019d secretly remembered the name and appearance of each greater demon. Moreover, Chen Xi noticed that similar to humans, these greater demons were particular about assigning positions according to seniority. For example, when they paid respect to him, they\u2019d followed the rule of coming forward in succession according to their strengths.Mu Kui had prepared good wine and savory fruits a while ago. He found an empty space between the pine forest before setting up some meditation cushions and tables, and only then did he invite Chen Xi and the others to take their seats.Of course, even though the place was simple, Chen Xi was still respectfully welcomed by all of the greater demons to sit at the head. Mu Kui directly sat on Chen Xi\u2019s right and attentively poured wine and gave fruit to Chen Xi; he was simply like a diligent and conscientious servant. However, this scene drew the envy of many greater demons, and if it wasn\u2019t for their status, they would be only too anxious to serve Chen Xi like Mu Kui.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be extremely curious.For example, the Spiritdove Mountain\u2019s Xiong Pi possessed the bloodline of the primordial variant beast, the Divine Herculean Bear. Xiong Pi\u2019s identity could be said to be incomparably respectable, and his strength was only a step away from developing his violet palace.\u201cSenior, you don\u2019t have to overanalyze it. You are the only one present that possesses a Violet Palace Realm cultivation, and demon cultivators like us only believe in strength. So long as your strength is more formidable than theirs, they would even be completely willing to be your slave if you wanted.\u201d Mu Kui who was by Chen Xi\u2019s side seemed to have noticed his bewilderment and sent Chen Xi a voice transmission in a low voice. \u201cSenior, feel free to eat and drink. A nice way of putting it would be that they came here to form a good relationship with you, a bad way would be they came here to get acquainted with you.\u201dChen Xi couldn\u2019t help but sigh with emotion.They drank wine and chatted idly, and unknowingly, it became dusk.\u201cSenior, this is an Azure Spiritgourd that grows within my Basanite Cavern and only forms every 1,000 years. It contains a dimension within it that is not only able to contain 5,000 kg of good wine, it also possesses the dual attributes of fire and ice, and when used to drink wine, it can freeze or warm up the wine. I hope Senior can kindly accept it.\u201d When the banquet ended, the greater demon Zhui Man of the Basanite Cavern walked forward and respectfully gifted a verdant green gourd, its shape was simple and natural, and it emitted traces of a misty green light.\u201cSenior, this is a Darkunicorn Fruit that was dug out from deep within the lake. It\u2019s extremely beneficial for stabilizing cultivation.\u201d\u201cThis Jadebone Lingzhi of mine was developed within the magma in the core of the earth. It\u2019s able to heal any injuries, and possess boundless magical effects. Senior, you must accept this.\u201d\u2026These greater demons had been prepared for a while now and they all took out some treasure or wondrous item before coming forward and offering it to Chen Xi.Chen Xi was extremely startled, whereas Mu Kui instead took advantage of this period of time to accept all the treasures with a natural expression, and wasn\u2019t courteous in the slightest.\u201cHmph! Competing to take out some useless things.\u201d Xiong Pi who\u2019d always been sitting up straight on the side had abruptly snorted coldly, causing the other greater demons to be stunned in unison. They gazed at Xiong Pi with extremely gloomy gazes.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. When those greater demons took out their things earlier, it looked to be novel and valuable, but they were all some auxiliary items that were of no great benefit to cultivating. So, what Xiong Pi said wasn\u2019t false.\u201cHmph! Fellow Daoist Xiong, the heavens know that our intentions are good. We\u2019re not like you who didn\u2019t gift anything, but only knows how to spout sarcastic remarks.\u201d\u201cExactly, although your cultivation is the highest amongst us, during this time that we came to pay our respects to Senior Chen Xi, you\u2019re intentionally sowing dissension. Your motives are very evil.\u201d\u201cYou think our things are useless? Alright, old freak Xiong, you take out something useful to allow us to broaden our vision.\u201dAll the greater demons directed the spearhead at Xiong Pi, they were either disdainful or ridiculing, and their words were filled with hostility.Chen Xi looked askance at Mu Kui, who remained completely indifferent, and he sent a voice transmission. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to stop it?\u201d\u201cXiong Pi\u2019s temper is like this, stopping him will only cause everyone to be unhappy. Senior, wait and see. Although this Xiong Pi is outspoken, since he had said this, I presume he\u2019s prepared.\u201d Mu Kui hurriedly sent a voice transmission to Chen Xi in explanation.Sure enough, it was as Mu Kui had said. Xiong Pi turned a deaf ear towards the surrounding sarcasm and mockery and drank all of the good wine in his cup with a single gulp before standing up, a treasure appearing within his hand.This item was like a fine and perfectly straight bamboo. It was one meter long with a completely dark body that was dim and dull. It looked to be ordinary, however, the moment it appeared in the air, a piercingly cold aura that caused one\u2019s heart to trembled silently suffused out into the air.All of the greater demons stared wide eyed with expressions of disbelief.Chen Xi\u2019s gaze couldn\u2019t help but lock on to the dark bamboo as well. After he\u2019d advanced to the Violet Palace Realm, his soul\u2019s Perception Force had advanced a level and it acutely detected that this dark bamboo seemed to contain a terrifyingly violent energy. The energy was like thunder from the nine heavens and carried along with it a strand of an aura of annihilation, causing one\u2019s heart to tremble.Xiong Pi whose body was tall and sturdy like a small hill swept his gaze towards the surroundings as he asked coldly. \u201cI wonder if this one meter long Seventhgold Swordbamboo is able to enter the eyes of everyone?\u201dWhen they heard this name, all the greater demons present gaped. Their gazes were already filled with boundless burning desire and greed as they gazed at the dark bamboo.At the same time that Chen Xi came to a sudden understanding, a wisp of shock couldn\u2019t help but surge out from his heart.Just as its name implied, the Seventhgold Swordbamboo was a treasure that innately possesses the attributes of both metal and wood, and its stem was sharp like a sword. It was a rare treasure in the world as it only grew a 3cm every 100 years and would experience lightning strikes after its growth. If it was able to withstand the lightning and not die, it would then experience another 100 years of life to grow another 3cm. However, most Seventhgold Swordbamboos were blasted to dust by lightning the moment they sprouted, and only one in 10,000 was able to safely survive.Therefore, the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in Xiong Pi\u2019s hand had probably already survived for 3,000 years. It had experienced no less than thirty lightning tribulations, yet even after experiencing so many lightning strikes, it still had not died. Thus, it was easily imaginable how terrifying the hardness was that the Seventhgold Swordbamboo had attained.\u201cSenior, please accept this!\u201d Xiong Pi walked forward and held his palms up to gift the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hands to Chen Xi.All the greater demons stared blankly at this scene. Even if they wracked their brains, they still couldn\u2019t understand why Xiong Pi would gift such an extremely valuable treasure to Chen Xi.Mu Kui was extremely excited as well and was about to help Chen Xi receive it when he was stopped by Chen Xi as he said resolutely, \u201cThis treasure is too valuable, Fellow Daoist Xiong, please keep it.\u201d\u201cThis treasure is useless in my hands; eating it would be tasteless, and throwing it away would be a shame. It would only be able to display its might in Senior\u2019s hands.\u201d Xiong Pi instead insisted on gifting it to Chen Xi and would not compromise.\u201cDo you have something you want to request of me?\u201d Chen Xi was silent for a long time before suddenly asking, his gaze staring fixedly at Xiong Pi\u2019s face.Xiong Pi seemed to not be surprised in the slightest and he said with a firm expression, \u201cExactly, I, Old Xiong, have no other request in my entire life. I only request that Senior can kill the Aqua Cavern\u2019s Black Ape King for me!\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, everyone present was shocked.On a large tree in the distance, the pupils of a spirit bird with white feathers constricted, and it flapped its wings right away to soar into the clouds, disappearing instantly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They bid their farewells to Chen Xi and left right away as if they were avoiding the plague. From the beginning until the end, they didn\u2019t spare Xiong Pi a single glance.Mu Kui couldn\u2019t help but become anxious when he saw this, and swiftly sent a voice transmission. \u201cSenior, that Black Ape King governs thousands of kilometers of the vicinity, and possesses a terrifying cultivation at the Violet Palace Realm. Which demon would dare disobey him? Although the Seventhgold Swordbamboo is valuable, Xiong Pi is obviously bringing harm to you and you must not agree to his request.\u201dChen Xi neither agreed nor disagreed when he heard this and only gazed at Xiong Pi.Now that Chen Xi had attained the Violet Palace Realm, his surrounding aura seemed to be indifferent, yet it carried along with it a trace of a formidable oppressive force from merging with the heavens and the earth.Xiong Pi was only at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm and he quickly succumbed to the pressure from Chen Xi\u2019s gaze, then he shook his head and sighed. \u201cNever mind, since Senior is unwilling, then take it as I, Old Xiong, never mentioned it.\u201d As he spoke, this tall and sturdy bear demon revealed a rare trace of helplessness and sorrow as he turned around to walk off in large strides.\u201cCan you tell me the reason?\u201d Chen Xi asked.\u201cMy young brother died miserably at the hands of the Black Ape King. As an elder brother, can I not seek revenge for him?\u201d Xiong Pi stopped dead in his tracks and only spoke out word by word after a long time, his slow voice filled with sorrow and resentment.Chen Xi suddenly thought of his own younger brother, Chen Hao. He thought of the scene when he saw Chen Hao\u2019s right hand crippled outside Pine Mist City, how overwhelmed with grief he was at the time, and he was stunned for a while.Chen Xi pondered for a moment and said, \u201cI\u2019m extremely curious, why are you sure that I can kill the Black Ape King? I want to know the reason.\u201dXiong Pi swiftly turned around and said in surprise, \u201cSenior, you\u2019re willing to help me?\u201dMu Kui who stood nearby frowned as he said, \u201cOld Xiong, do you think that Senior Chen Xi would agree under the state of not knowing anything?\u201dXiong Pi took a deep breath as if he was restraining the excitement in his heart and said slowly, \u201cThat Black Ape King possesses the weakest strength amongst the seven great demon kings. Although he advanced to the Violet Palace Realm a long time ago, he\u2019s only cultivated up to the 4th star Violet Palace Realm.\u201dMu Kui laughed out of extreme anger. \u201cSenior Chen Xi has only just broken through to the Violet Palace Realm and you want him to kill a 4th star Violet Palace Realm Black Ape King?\u201dXiong Pi expression remained unchanged as he continued. \u201cThis information is indeed unable to help Senior, but I feel that Senior will battle the Black Ape King sooner or later. One mountain cannot house two tigers, I presume Senior understands this logic better than I.\u201d\u201cMoreover, I\u2019ve already obtained the news that Li Hu died at your hands. Li Hu was the trusted subordinate and informant of the Black Ape King and had always helped the Black Ape King patrol his territory. Now that Li Hu is dead, the Black Ape King will surely not let the matter go.\u201d Xiong Pi tossed out another bombshell.\u201cLi Hu is the trusted subordinate and informant of the Black Ape King? Impossible, how could I not know?\u201d Mu Kui cried out in alarm and had an expression of disbelief. If it was really as Xiong Pi had said, then he would be in imminent danger as well. After all, Li Hu had died on Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, and it was common knowledge that he, Mu Kui, had the closest relationship with Chen Xi\u2026\u201cHow would Li Hu be an informant for the Black Ape King if you knew?\u201d Xiong Pi asked rhetorically.Mu Kui was finally in a panic and he had a bewildered expression as he cast his gaze at Chen Xi. He was a Congenital Realm greater demon after all, and had lived in the Black Ape King\u2019s territory for more than a thousand years, how could he not know how formidable the Black Ape King was?\u201cIn that case, regardless of if I help you or not, I would still encounter the vengeance of the Black Ape King?\u201d Chen Xi asked coldly.Xiong Pi didn\u2019t speak, but his attitude said everything.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll take your Seventhgold Swordbamboo, but I won\u2019t take the initiative to make a move against the Black Ape King unless he comes knocking on my door.\u201d Chen Xi said this because he was worried that Xiong Pi had deceived him.\u201cThank you, Senior. No matter if it\u2019s a success or failure, I, Old Xiong, will never forget the great kindness of Senior in this lifetime!\u201d Xiong Pi knelt on the ground with a thump, then kowtowed three times with three resounding bangs. When he raised his head, tears were already flowing out from his eyes.When this straightforward, big and tall fellow had acquired Chen Xi\u2019s promise, he seemed to have put down the load he\u2019d carried within his heart for many years. He cried silently, he cried sorrowfully, and he cried in joy!\u2014\u2014At Aqua Cavern, a white haired young man in green robes stared blankly at the message in his hand and he muttered, \u201cI wonder what Old Freak Roc wants to do, his tone seems so anxious. I\u2019m afraid this fellow hasn\u2019t only invited me, could it be that something great is about to occur?\u201dIt was at this moment \u2014Swoosh!A white feathered spirit bird flew in and transformed into a beautiful female demon who shouted anxiously. \u201cGreat King, a disaster is imminent!\u201dThe white haired young man is green clothes was precisely the owner of Aqua Cavern, one of the seven great demon kings, the Black Ape King Yuan Tong. He glared at the beautiful female demon in displeasure and asked, \u201cXiao Ru, how many times have I said it? You must be calm on every occasion and great event, what use is being panicked? Hurry up and speak, what has happened?\u201dThe beautiful female demon was Xiao Ru, and she took a deep breath before saying swiftly, \u201cGreat King asked me to look for Li Hu, but unexpectedly, the tiger demon died long ago!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Yuan Tong was stunned.\u201cNot only that, I passed by Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, and not only did I discover the corpse of Li Hu, I noticed many greater demons gathered together at its hillside, and they seemed to be congratulating a human cultivator.\u201dYuan Tong was stunned again. \u201cHuman cultivator?\u201d\u201cYeah, those greater demons addressed him as Chen Xi. According to my observations, that person seems to have only just advanced to the Violet Palace Realm, and that\u2019s the reason why it drew these greater demons to pay their respects together.\u201d\u201cNo wonder. So it turns out that it was this human cultivator that advanced to the Violet Palace Realm a few days ago.\u201d Yuan Tong finally wrapped his head around the matter, and a trace of ferociousness flashed on his fair face. \u201cHmph! You\u2019re on my territory, but not only do you not come pay your respects to me, you instead kill my trusted subordinate, Li Hu. You\u2019re truly courting death!\u201d\u201cGreat King, that person does indeed deserve death. But the most detestable one is instead that Spiritdove Mountain\u2019s Xiong Pi. He actually took out a one meter long Seventhgold Swordbamboo and offered it to that human cultivator\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat! Seventhgold Swordbamboo? And it\u2019s even one meter long?\u201d Before Xiao Ru could even finish speaking, Yuan Tong\u2019s expression had become excited and he roared loudly. \u201cThis damn bear demon. He actually dared not offer such a treasure to me? Truly damnable!\u201d\u201cGreat King, this Xiong Pi had a condition for offering up the Seventhgold Swordbamboo. The condition was that the human cultivator must agree to kill\u2026 Kill\u2026\u201d Xiao Ru spoke falteringly.\u201cKill who?\u201d Yuan Tong as already angered to the point he had a savage expression, demonic qi raged on his entire body and he looked extremely terrifying.\u201cKill\u2026\u201d\u201cSpeak quickly!\u201d\u201cKill you, Great King.\u201dBang!Yuan Tong smashed his palm against the nearby table and it instantly transformed into a pile of powder.\u201cDammit! Dammit! They all deserve to die!\u201d Yuan Tong was transformed from a Black Ape that was cruel and ruthless by nature. At this moment, under his explosive rage, patches of hair that were black and like steel needles instantly surged out from his fair face, then his mouth opened wide and two rows of sharp fangs instantly grew out by 60cm and were exposed in the air.Howl!Yuan Tong emitted a long howl towards the sky, his billowing voice that contained monstrous cruelty rushed out of Aqua Cavern and surged within an area of 500km, shocking the demons that were cultivating nearby to drop flat on the ground and ceaselessly shiver.After a long time.Sounds of intense breathing echoed out, seeming to be suppressing the flames of rage in his heart.\u201cDetestable! I have to go for the matter Old Freak Roc called me for. Never mind, I\u2019ll properly torture these damnable things to death after I return from Moonhowl Ridge!\u201d Yuan Tong\u2019s low, deep, and cruel voice surged ceaselessly within Aqua Cavern.\u2014\u2014Three days passed by.Mu Kui instead felt as if it was three years, as every second caused him to be unable to rest in peace.Mu Kui was unable to wrap his head around it. It was precisely because he couldn\u2019t wrap his head around it that living through these past few days was too painful. He felt as if he was an ant that was waiting to die, but he just happened to not know when death would come\u2026When he thought of this, Mu Kui couldn\u2019t help but gaze into the distance. Within the sea of clouds on the precipice, he saw a tall and thin figure cultivating his sword technique. The figure\u2019s clothes danced lightly in the wind and his sword moved like the wind; his expression was serious and concentrated, and his posture was agile and graceful.Mu Kui already didn\u2019t know how many times he\u2019d praised Chen Xi. Every time his thoughts were restless and uneasy during these three days, he would come to this spot. As long as he saw Chen Xi\u2019s figure, his heart would feel much more at ease, as if he wouldn\u2019t be afraid even if the sky collapsed.Actually, Chen Xi\u2019s pressure was no different from Mu Kui. He never expected that he\u2019d only just advanced to the Violet Palace Realm, but he\u2019d already offended the Aqua Cavern\u2019s Black Ape King because he killed Li Hu. However, since he was unable to hide, he instead spent all of his pressure and thoughts on cultivating.The Violet Palace Realm was a completely new realm, a qualitative transformation. If he wanted to exert all of his strength and control this strength with both skill and ease, then he must practice diligently and bitterly.At the moment, he was cultivating the Windflow Divination Sword, and what he held in his hand was shockingly the one meter long Seventhgold Swordbamboo.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Sword lights waved out. They were like a swift gale that howled out with speeds that were swift like bolts of lightning, and they tore through the sky to leave behind numerous residual sword marks.The first move in the Windflow Divination Sword \u2014 Galeflash Shadow!Supposedly, when cultivated to the limit, or in other words the unity-stage, it would be possible to slash a falling leaf into over 1,000 orderly and even fine threads with a single wave of the sword as it was incomparably swift.Moreover, what caused Chen Xi to be joyous was due to the extreme sharpness of the Seventhgold Swordbamboo and the extremely terrifying vigorous thunder qi contained within it; when he executed the Galeflash Shadow, not only was it extremely swift like lightning, it also added an awe-inspiring destructive force to his attacks, and its formidable might exceeded his expectations.\u201cI already mastered my sword technique to the advanced-stage before. If I\u2019m able to break through to the unity-stage in a short amount of time, then I ought to have an extra bit of assurance when battling the Black Ape King.\u201dTime trickled by.At the side of the precipice covered in a sea of clouds, sword lights swept out like a myriad of waterfalls, as some emerged, some would die out, and Chen Xi was like a tireless puppet as he immersed himself into his infinitely profound sword technique.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 Wind Dao InsightPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67 \u2013 Wind Dao InsightOne month later, at the peak of Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.Chen Xi held the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand while under the attentive gaze of Ji Yu. He took a breath and his wrist trembled, a Galeflash Shadow splashing out.Hiss! Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!Countless sharp sword streaks were like billowing waves that surged out as the sound of wind and lightning howling resounded out with a hum. The heaven and earth seemed to be filled with a cold and dazzling flowing light that was swift like a shadow.Whoosh!A sword light flashed, and the scene abruptly changed.The sword images were fine and lingered in the air continuously, then caused circles of ripples to undulate in the air. The ripples seemed soft and fine, yet they instantly minced the clouds in an area of 30 meters into dust that completely dispersed.The move was impressively the second move of the Windflow Divination Sword \u2014 Breezy Rain!\u201cThis kid is not bad, the Breezy Rain stresses on the word lingering, and it contains hidden killing intent within it. He\u2019s obviously already mastered its essence.\u201d Nearby, Ji Yu nodded unnoticeably.The third move, Dark Storm \u2014 The sword images roared rapidly and swiftly as they advanced, retreated, and circled around. For a time, the sword images were like clouds as they covered the entire sky, and everywhere the sword images swept it was filled with dense and violent sword qi.The fourth move, Tide Squall \u2014 The sword images howled out like a raging tide, the force of the sword was vigorous and unrestrained as it moved about freely and violently, like a myriad of enormous waves that had overlapped on one another to surge in the heaven and the earth, like a tide that had risen from the blue sea.Whoosh!Chen Xi stopped and put away his sword after executing the four moves of the sword technique, then he lightly spat out a mouthful of foul air, seeming calm and collected.\u201cNow bad, you\u2019ve already completely mastered the first four moves.\u201d Ji Yu nodded and evaluated. \u201cBut, the unity-stage is not bound by moves, and once you\u2019ve completely comprehended it, then a casual stab of your sword will be able to draw upon the energy of heaven and earth. Only that is considered to be the true unity-stage.\u201dChen Xi nodded and accepted Ji Yu\u2019s teachings.Subsequently, Ji Yu started assessing the Divine Windwing Flight that Chen Xi cultivated.The two of them arrived at a dense and green sea of bamboo behind Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.\u201cThis sea of bamboo is roughly 50km in distance, what you need to do is shuttle back and forth through it. You\u2019re not allowed to touch any of the stems or leaves on the way, and the tip of your foot mustn\u2019t touch the ground.\u201d Ji Yu instructed indifferently. \u201cYou must complete it within the time of ten breaths.\u201dAs he gazed at the dense and luxuriant sea of bamboo, Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but frown.He\u2019d only started to cultivate the Divine Windwing Flight half a month ago, but he\u2019d always cultivated it at the peak of Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain. It was extremely spacious there and mountain winds whistled past. Thus he was able to willfully fly around in the air and it was extremely satisfying.However, at this moment, when faced with this sea of bamboo, and wanting to pass through the entire sea of bamboo within the time of ten breaths without touching a single stem or leaf, this was no easy feat.\u201cWorried that you\u2019re unable to do it?\u201d Ji Yu shook his head and derided. \u201cThis test is still the most basic. A battle between cultivators is carried out while flying through the heavens and earth, and would stop at nothing. It isn\u2019t like how you imagine, simple mindedly exchanging blows, but it\u2019s instead the utilization of your ability while using every trick up your sleeve. For example, battling while shifting about like ghosts. If your movement technique is inferior, then not to mention battling, I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t even be able to dodge your opponent\u2019s attacks.\u201dThe hesitation in Chen Xi\u2019s heart was completely intensified from what Ji Yu said and it transformed into unwillingness that surged out from his heart. He instantly tapped the tip of his foot on the ground, and his figure transformed into a wisp of a ray of light as he charged into the luxuriant bamboo forest in the blink of an eye.Whoosh!Piercingly cold wind flashed past from the sides of his body, but Chen Xi maintained his diving posture as he looked concentrated and unblinkingly into the distance.He couldn\u2019t touch the bamboo stems or leaves, so he changed his direction to circumnavigate the bamboo that were densely gathered together. However, the change of direction was instead wasting time. Even if it was only a mere instant, to Chen Xi who had to travel through the sea of bamboo within the time of ten breaths, it was undoubtedly an enormous waste.After a short moment, Chen Xi flew out of the sea of bamboo.\u201c26 breaths of time, not good enough.\u201d Ji Yu shook his head ceaselessly.Chen Xi had an expressionless face as he flew in once again.\u201c18 breaths, not good enough.\u201d\u201c12 breaths, touched three bamboo leaves, not good enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026Not good enough.\u201dThe words \u2018not good enough\u2019 filled Chen Xi\u2019s thoughts throughout the entire afternoon. The voice was calm and indifferent, yet it seemed like nightmare that caused him to not only feel embarrassed, but also completely aroused the stubbornness and unyieldingness in his head. After Ji Yu left, he shuttled back and forth within the sea of bamboos by himself without slacking in the slightest.Every time when he was exhausted to the point he almost unable to hold on, it seemed as if the words \u2018not good enough\u2019 were lightly spat out from Ji Yu\u2019s mouth and resounded by his ear, then he would once again grit his teeth and stand up to once again charge into the sea of bamboo\u2026Bang!Sweat flowed down his body like snakes and his heavy breathing resounded in the night sky. Chen Xi was unable to stand up and he fell flat on his back. The True Essence in his body was completely wrung out, to the point he wasn\u2019t even willing to move a finger.He just lay there like that, staring blankly at the sky above him that was suffused with an array of stars, leaving his sweat to flow down his body like numerous streams.\u201cTen breaths of time, I was only a step away\u2026\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s throat was extremely hoarse and his eyes filled with annoyance and unwillingness. He was completely unaware that Ji Yu was standing in the distance silently watching him attentively, and that his experienced eyes revealed a rare trace of admiration.Ten days later.Chen Xi vanished before the sea of bamboo with a \u2018swoosh.\u2019Swoosh! Swoosh!Due to his speed being too swift, everywhere Chen Xi passed the warm breeze in the air would become piercingly cold like knives, and a string of afterimages were left behind in the air. These afterimages only vanished like bubbles after one breath of time, and by that time, Chen Xi was already more than 5km away.Looking down from mid-air, at this moment, Chen Xi was like an extremely nimble bolt of black lightning within the luxuriant sea of bamboo as he dodged past the clusters of dense bamboo leaves and flashed past the numerous sturdy bamboo stems. His speed was so swift that an ordinary person\u2019s vision was utterly unable to catch up to him!After a short moment, Chen Xi swiftly flashed out the sea of bamboos.\u201cEight breaths of time, not bad. It\u2019s much better than I expected.\u201d Ji Yu nodded as he praised.A feeling as if he was in another world couldn\u2019t help but arise in Chen Xi\u2019s heart when he heard Ji Yu finally stop saying \u2018not good enough,\u2019 yet he wasn\u2019t excited, as the hardships and sweat he\u2019d experienced these past few days had completely transformed into tranquility that was like a still lake.\u201cNow that your sword technique and movement technique have both attained the unity stage, if you want to continue advancing, then you must go comprehend.\u201d Ji Yu pondered before saying, \u201cBasic, advanced, unity, they are all attainable by relying on diligent and bitter training. The fourth stage, Dao Insight, instead requires you to comprehend the Dao of the Heavens, and when you\u2019re able to comprehend a strand of the meaning of the Dao, you\u2019ll be able to form Sword Insight and Movement Insight.\u201dChen Xi\u2019s brain hummed and it was as if he was suddenly enlightened.In the past, he\u2019d always heard people say that the most important thing in the path of cultivation was to comprehend the great meaning behind the Dao of the Heavens, as only then would one be able to walk to the peak of the Dao. But at that time, his cultivation was low and he was ignorant to all this. He kept having the feeling that it was too far away, so he\u2019d never once paid attention to it.Now that he\u2019d advanced to the Violet Palace Realm to establish his foundation of the Grand Dao and experienced many days of cultivation, he already unconsciously possessed a vague trace of hazy perception of the Grand Dao. Presently, when Ji Yu revealed the truth, it felt as if a new window had been pushed open before him, and he saw a completely new and magnificent world!Dao Insight!At this moment, Chen Xi was full of excitement.After a long time, Chen Xi\u2019s mood finally returned to a calm state and he thought of a problem that he must solve now \u2014\u201cCultivate bitterly and diligently, visualize and meditate, then wait for good luck to arrive.\u201d Ji Yu replied in an extremely succinct, yet vague, manner.Think about it, if there were methods to comprehend the Grand Dao, then everyone in the world would have stepped on the path to the Grand Dao long ago.Chen Xi frowned as he pondered, and he still shook his head after quite a long time. These things that could be encountered by luck but not sought after, were things that were impossible for him to have the determination that he would surely obtain it.Ji Yu couldn\u2019t refrain from reminding him when he saw this. \u201cSlow-witted. Let me ask you, are there any similarities between the Windflow Divination Sword and the Divine Windwing Flight?\u201dChen Xi\u2019s eyes lit up, as he already had a plan in his heart.Ji Yu smiled and said, \u201cThe Dao of Wind is constantly changing: violent, gentle, sharp, lingering\u2026 It\u2019s the most unrestrained and free. If you want to master the essence of the Windflow Divination Sword and the Divine Windwing Flight, then you must first know what exactly wind is.\u201d\u2014\u2014Chen Xi sat cross-legged within the sea of clouds at the side of Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain\u2019s precipice as he felt the mountain wind whistle past him.The mountain wind moved swiftly and was difficult to find, but Chen Xi\u2019s sword technique and movement technique had long since attained the unity-stage, and he\u2019d quickly merged his mind with the wind within the world.When the wind flashed past the billowing sea of clouds and swept past his face, he would be able to clearly feel its speed, trajectory, strength, and even every tiny detail in the subtle changes in the wind appeared within his mind.\u201cThis mountain wind is piercingly cold like a saber and swift like lightning.\u201d Three days later, Chen Xi opened his eyes, seeming as if he\u2019d comprehended something. Without the slightest hesitation, he stood up and flew into the air like a garuda, and in an instant he\u2019d already flashed over 5km away. Compared to before, his movement technique faintly carried within it a strand of an inexplicable aura. It had become even more profound and faster.After a short moment, before a lake in the area of Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.Chen Xi didn\u2019t delay in the slightest before sitting on the ground to face the vast surface of the lake.Swish!The wind stirred the surface of the lake, causing wave after wave of ripples. As it flashed past the lotus flowers on the surface of the lake, it carried along a trace of gentleness, like a person that was deeply in love was stroking the face of their sweetheart.\u201cThis lake wind is gentle and fine, and is continuous like the rain\u2026\u201d Seven days later, Chen Xi opened his eyes once again, and the pondering expression within his eyes had become even stronger. He then got up and flew off to vanish by the lakeside.Day after day passed by, Chen Xi\u2019s footprints spread all over the peak of the mountain, the lake, the rocky area; during a heavy shower, under the fiercely shining sun\u2026 His perception of wind grew deeper and deeper.\u201cThe wind contains a myriad of changes, and its form is constantly changing. Regardless of if it was a gale, a breeze, mountain wind, lake wind, and even the wind after rain; its speed, force, and trajectory were completely different, displaying the Dao of changing to the greatest extent. But what is the source of these changes?\u201dAnother month passed by.Chen Xi sat alone within the abode as he meditated on every type of wind that he\u2019d comprehended during these past few days.\u201cFreedom! Without freedom, there is no wind!\u201dChen Xi\u2019s body trembled. When good fortune comes, the mind becomes clear, and it was like he\u2019d pierced through a piece of paper and he was suddenly enlightened!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 Chen Xis Combat StrengthPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 68 \u2013 Chen Xi\u2019s Combat StrengthWithout freedom, there is no wind!Chen Xi\u2019s mind was immersed in a profound state, Dao existed within the boundless time of the world, and the Dao of Wind existed in the land, rivers, verdant grass, rocks\u2026 everywhere.As the wind blew past a hill, the clouds and mist that were blown away were its shadows. As it blew past lotus leaves, that swaying posture was its traces. This was the aura of the Dao, the meaning of the Dao!Chen Xi silently sat cross-legged atop the peak of the mountain and his handsome face carried a peaceful expression, yet his mind had followed the heaven and the earth, followed the wind that was dancing in the sky, he was soaring and seeking the wind.Dao Comprehension!Ji Yu stood in the distance, his clothed fluttering in the wind, and his gaze was profound like lightning as he looked at Chen Xi with a gaze that carried a trace of joy and delight.The state of Dao Comprehension was something that could be encountered by luck but not sought after, but it would surely exist after sufficient accumulation was done. Without the diligent and bitter training in the earlier days, then even if one had the opportunity to encounter a bit of the essence of Dao, it would be extremely difficult to grasp it.Only after one had accumulated various experiences would one be able to completely bond the mind with the heaven and the earth at the instant that good luck had arrived, and only then would one be able to learn and comprehend a trace of the existence of the Dao in their chaotic and unconscious state of Dao Comprehension.The stars changed position, the bright moon rose and the vast sun set.Along with the passage of time, strands of wind started to gather by the side of Chen Xi who sat cross-legged there, stirring his hair and stroking his face, gentle like a lover that had just been reunited.\u201cShriek!\u201d A vulture flew over from afar, its sharp gaze stared at the youth at the side of the precipice as if it was gazing at a delicious meal. As a wild bird that hadn\u2019t developed intelligence yet, it didn\u2019t sense the strands of dangerous aura atop Chen Xi\u2019s body. \u00a0It was extremely hungry and had been this way for a long time, to the point it utterly didn\u2019t care to consider much. With a plunge, it swiftly charged downwards, opening its sharp claws to fiercely grab at the youth.When it was still 30 meters away from Chen Xi.Hiss!It was like a hurricane had appeared out of thin air, the swift and fierce trail of wind contained the energy of heaven and earth and it instantly completely minced the vulture into fine pieces. Due to the wind being too dense and sharp, the fresh blood that splattered out was also pulverized into balls of bloody mist, and then it was blown by the wind to vanish without a trace. From the beginning until the end, not a shred of the smell of blood escaped, and if speed hadn\u2019t attained an extremely terrifying level, it would have been utterly impossible to do this!\u201cHe has comprehended it. His strength has already obtained a qualitative change, and I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be long before he\u2019s able to pass the 1st level of the Heavenpeak of Trials. Whereas I\u2026 I\u2019m afraid it would be difficult for me to leave the Manor in the future.\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s expression was complicated with a trace of absentmindedness, then it was replaced with an expression of staunchness. \u201cI\u2019ve already helped him enough. With his current strength and mentality, he\u2019s completely capable of taking care of himself. Continuing to stay by his side would only impede his path of the Grand Dao\u2026\u201dAt dawn seven days later, the vast sun had risen into the sky and light illuminated the world.Chen Xi, who sat cross-legged on the side of the precipice, opened his eyes, and the corners of his mouth revealed a rare trace of a smile.Whoosh!In the next moment, Chen Xi didn\u2019t seem to move, yet his figure had already appeared in midair, and a pair of wings that were condensed from a gale seemed to have appeared out of thin air behind him. He instantly tore through the sky, willfully soaring in the air, and under the rays of the morning sun, that figure that whirled about like a bolt of lightning and broke open countless streams of air within the clouds seemed like a dreamlike figure.Wind!Freedom!Chen Xi\u2019s figure had become even swifter, even freer and easy, and his entire body was like fluttering wind, possessing an indistinct trail causing his figure to be difficult to find.\u2014\u2014Cultivating deep in the mountains while isolated from the world causes time to pass by unknowingly.Three months of time had passed in a flash. From the anxiousness and uneasiness from the very beginning, Mu Kui\u2019s mood had gradually become tranquil.The Aqua Cavern\u2019s Black Ape King hadn\u2019t appeared after a very long time, and this caused Mu Kui to be even more firmly convinced that Xiong Pi was deceiving him and deceiving Senior Chen Xi. That Li Hu wasn\u2019t the trusted subordinate of the Black Ape King at all, because if the Black Ape King was one who sought revenge for the smallest grievance, then how could he allow Senior Chen Xi to live for three months?One mountain cannot house two tigers? Nonsense!Mu Kui held a wine jug as he cozily leaned in front of the abode and ceaselessly drank to his heart\u2019s content. He liked these sort of days, quiet and peaceful. Senior Chen Xi was holding down the fort atop the mountain. He didn\u2019t have to worry that the other greater demons nearby would come disturb or swallow up his territory.Whoosh!A figure appeared out of thin air with a speed that was like teleportation, and it scared Mu Kui to the point his body went stiff and the wine jug in his hand fell with a clank. When he focused and glanced over, it was shockingly Senior Chen Xi.Mu Kui couldn\u2019t help but feel a burst of embarrassment. I\u2019m probably in an extremely sorry state right now, right? However\u2026 Senior Chen Xi\u2019s speed is truly too swift! He appeared before me in the blink of an eye, who wouldn\u2019t be scared half dead?\u201cPrepare a brush and a dish of ink for me.\u201d Chen Xi entered the abode as soon as he finished speaking.\u201cOh, alright, wait a moment, Senior.\u201d Mu Kui stomped on the floor and got up, then started preparing swiftly, yet he was secretly curious in his heart. What does Senior Chen Xi want to do?\u2014\u2014Within the abode, Chen Xi removed a book from his storage ring, it wasn\u2019t a cultivation method, but was instead the little gains and experiences he obtained from cultivating.After pondering for a long time within his mind, Chen Xi took up the brush and dipped it into the ink, then slowly wrote out all the experiences and changes in his thoughts while he cultivated during this period of time.\u201cHis brush technique is free and graceful, yet its aura is powerful and sharp; every word he writes is exquisitely written, providing a lifelike picture. Your improvement during this period of time is indeed extremely great.\u201d After Chen Xi finished writing, Ji Yu floated in the air when he appeared and nodded as he assessed.Chen Xi didn\u2019t even raise his head before taking out a piece of paper, then swiftly writing a line of words with a \u2018swish\u2019 and passed it to Ji Yu.Since the day he cultivated the movement technique and sword technique, Ji Yu had requested that he take a day from every month for self-examination, to comprehend the changes in his strength and to summarize his combat experience.These papers that were used to write self-examinations were called by Chen Xi as the Self-Reflection Diary .\u201cDon\u2019t write this sort of thing in the future again.\u201d Ji Yu stopped reading and passed the paper back to Chen Xi. \u201cSelf-examination is for the sake of urging your improvement and to avoid deviating from the right path. Now that you\u2019ve already established your Dao Foundation and have truly stepped onto the road to immortality, there\u2019s already no meaning in writing these things. What you need to do is comprehend the Heaven Dao and stay true to your heart.\u201d\u201cComprehend the Heaven Dao and stay true to my heart\u2026\u201d Chen Xi repeated it and seemed as if he\u2019d thought of something. He only came back to his senses after some time, then he recalled a question that he was puzzled about right now and asked right away. \u201cSenior, may I ask how my current strength is, and how is it compared to other Violet Palace Realm cultivators?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Ji Yu answered with a question.Chen Xi thought for a moment then shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve only fought with Li Huai who was at the Violet Palace Realm, moreover, I was only at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm at that time. I\u2019m really unable to make an accurate estimate in this aspect.\u201dChen Xi was indeed unable to make an estimate of his own combat strength, as strictly speaking, he had two methods of combat, after all. One method was the School of Fiendgod Body Refinement that relied on the strength of his body to conduct close quarter battles; the other method was the School of Qi Refinement that after experiencing these past few days of bitter training had already become capable of executing a sword technique and movement technique at the Dao Insight Stage. However, due to lacking combat with Violet Palace Realm cultivators, his combat strength was sometimes strong and sometimes weak, so it wasn\u2019t easy for him to come to a conclusion.\u201cKilling ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivators is like killing chickens and monkeys!\u201d Ji Yu spoke shocking words.Even if Chen Xi was mentally prepared since long ago, he still couldn\u2019t help but feel a burst of astonishment. Like killing chicken and monkeys? Could it be that I\u2019m already formidable to this extent?\u201cAre you extremely surprised? You should know that your sword technique already contains a strand of Dao Insight, and an ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivator would only be at the unity-stage. Solely in terms of sword technique, your strength has already surpassed most Violet Palace Realm cultivators.\u201cMoving on to your cultivation.\u201d\u201cIn the aspect of qi refinement, you already possess the attainment of the 1st star of the Violet Palace Realm, and the Ice Crane Technique is exquisite and ingenious. As far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s also a precious qi cultivation technique, but unfortunately, it only records the technique of cultivation for the nine levels of the Violet Palace Realm. Even then, regardless of if it was might or volume, your True Essence is far from something an ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivator is able to compare to.\u201d Ji Yu spoke with fervor and assurance, then he revealed a trace of regret. \u201cUnfortunately, your diligent training in the Martial Dao has instead caused you to neglect body refinement. If you\u2019re able to attain the Violet Palace Realm in body refinement and condense a star diagram from shaman markings, your strength would increase by at least 20%.\u201d\u201cOf course, relying on your soul\u2019s current Perception Force, it\u2019s already sufficient for you to cultivate this soul attack technique, Godly Illusion. If you\u2019re able to completely master it, your chances of winning against an enemy would increase a great deal.\u201dJi Yu quickly returned to normal and continued to analyze Chen Xi\u2019s combat strength for him. \u201cAll in all, your current strength ought to be able to go against a cultivator with a cultivation around the 5th star Violet Palace Realm.\u201d\u201c5th star Violet Palace Realm? Continuously leaping four levels?\u201d Chen Xi gasped, as he was slightly unable to believe it.Ji Yu said seriously, \u201cHowever, you had better not look down on Violet Palace Realm cultivators. It\u2019s a fundamental leap from the Congenital Realm to the Violet Palace Realm, and Violet Palace Realm cultivators are already able to utilize graded Magic Treasures. These fellows have numerous skills and are adept at various different ways of attack, like formations, puppets, spirit flames, techniques\u2026 In the hands of these Violet Palace Realm cultivators, they\u2019re all able to display monstrous might.\u201d\u201cAfter saying so much, you actually only have to remember one thing, there\u2019s a varying level of strength amongst Violet Palace Realm cultivators, and there are plenty of people who are able to annihilate a 9th star Violet Palace Realm cultivator with a cultivation at the 1st star of the Violet Palace Realm. There\u2019re even Violet Palace Realm cultivators that are able to kill Golden Hall Realm cultivators!\u201dChen Xi gasped, he suddenly felt that after listening to Ji Yu\u2019s explanation, he\u2019d instead become even more confused.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be surprised about? Didn\u2019t you kill a Violet Palace Realm cultivator at the Congenital Realm? At that time, you hadn\u2019t established your Dao Foundation yet, and you were unable to fly in the air or control Magic Treasures.\u201d Ji Yu seemed to understand Chen Xi\u2019s feelings and he said with a smile, \u201cAfter saying all this, I only want to remind you, never underestimate any enemy, but don\u2019t be afraid of battle. If you can\u2019t win, then run, it\u2019s no big deal. Some experts were chased after by others, and slowly, bit by bit, in the end they instead wiped out all the people that chased after them.\u201dChen Xi\u2019s mind slightly eased up and he couldn\u2019t help but jest. \u201cThe fleeing ability of that fellow is surely extremely formidable, otherwise, he would have been surrounded and annihilated long ago.\u201d\u201cIt was indeed. I remember that expert seemed to be surnamed Han, and people gave him the nickname \u2018Speedy Han,\u2019 but unfortunately, that was a figure from before the primordial era.\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s eyes revealed an expression of recollection as he sighed with deep emotion, then he changed the topic and said, \u201cI suggest you spend your time on body refinement and the cultivation of your soul from today onwards. Once your body refinement attains the Violet Palace Realm, you ought to be able to pass the 1st level of the Heavenpeak of Trials.\u201dThe 1 st level of the Heavenpeak of Trials?Chen Xi lowered his head to glance at his palm, and under his skin and flesh, the pattern of a jade pendant could be indistinctly noticed.Numerous scenes silently slipped past his mind. His mother, Zuoqiu Xue, leaving behind her spiritual brand and Star Secret Realm; the surging river that Senior Ji Yu hid himself in, the dark and precipitous Heavenpeak that stood at the center of the river and towered into the clouds\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 Come KnockingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69 \u2013 Come KnockingDeep within the mountain range, at Moonhowl Ridge.Moonhowl Ridge occupied an area of 5,000km. The mountain stood low, yet it was like an ancient colossus that lay on the ground, giving out a desolate, bloody, and powerful aura, as if it was the king of the lands and looked down on the world!This place was the residence of the Roc King, Zhan Feng.The dense demonic qi here transformed into numerous ramrod straight pillars of smoke that shot into the sky and formed roiling dark clouds that enveloped the area below the sky all year long, seeming to be displaying the monstrous power of its owner.\u201cHave you heard, our King joined forces with four other demon kings this time, and they spent three months to capture eight human cultivators in one go.\u201d\u201cHow could I not know of such a sensational event? I even heard that the King intends to refine those eight human cultivators into a cauldron of medicinal pills!\u201d\u201cMedicinal Pill? No wonder the King doesn\u2019t kill them, so it\u2019s for the sake of refining medicinal pills.\u201d\u201cShh! Softly! Do you want to die!?\u201d\u201cLooks quickly! That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Copper Mountain\u2019s Thunderhawk King and the Aqua Cavern\u2019s Black Ape King!\u201dAt the outer area of Moonhowl Ridge, two greater demons on patrol were whispering in discussion. Seeming to have noticed something, they abruptly raised their heads and looked towards the sky. There, two figures covered in billowing demonic qi stepped on the clouds and mist as they swiftly flashed towards the distance like meteors.\u2026\u201cXue Yu, why are you following me?\u201d In midair, a figure that was suffused with demonic qi had abruptly stopped before glancing backward with a gloomy expression. He wore green robes and had white hair, possessing a handsome appearance. It was shockingly the Aqua Cavern\u2019s Black Ape King, Yuan Tong.As he spoke, another figure followed up to stand shoulder to shoulder with him. This person had a gaunt figure and eyes that were like lightning, an eagle nose and thin lips. He wore a violet coat, seeming to be extremely cold yet graceful. He was one of the seven great demon kings, the Copper Mountain\u2019s Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu.Xue Yu acted curious as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s just that I saw Big Brother Yuan\u2019s brows knitted, it seems\u2026 you have a load on your mind?\u201d\u201cHmph! What load could I have on my mind? You\u2019re truly a strange fellow.\u201d Yuan Tong grunted coldly, then turned and left; yet his heart was filled with misgivings.Three months ago, when he\u2019d complied with the invitation of the Roc King, Zhan Feng, and come to Moonhowl Ridge, he noticed that besides him, the Copper Mountain\u2019s Thunderhawk King, the Moonlight Lake\u2019s Dark Wyrm King, and the Sunset Forest\u2019s Azure Python King had already been there since long ago.Only afterwards did he find out that the Roc King had actually noticed a group of human cultivators. These cultivators were scattered throughout the depths of the mountain range and all possessed Violet Palace Realm cultivations. The Roc King invited them over for the sake of capturing these human cultivators, as he desired to refine them into a cauldron of Bloodsoul Fortune Pills!The Bloodsoul Fortune Pills possessed a miraculous effect. Once consumed, it was able to heighten the chances of a Violet Palace Realm cultivator advancing to the Golden Hall Realm, and it was an extremely valuable medicinal pill. However, so long as they agreed to join forces with the Roc King and capture these human cultivators, then once the Bloodsoul Fortune Pills were refined, they would be able to obtain a portion of them.When faced with such temptation, all four demon kings, including Yuan Tong, had agreed directly. They had spent three months, but were only successful in capturing eight human cultivators. They still lacked one last human cultivators before they could start refining the Bloodsoul Fortune Pill. They\u2019d bitterly searched for many days, yet weren\u2019t able to discover a single one.The pill refinement plan was at an impasse, but Yuan Tong had instead recalled Chen Xi. For the sake of the extremely valuable Seventhgold Swordbamboo in Chen Xi\u2019s possession, he was unwilling to reveal this matter to the other demon kings. He planned to go alone and seize the Seventhgold Swordbamboo before capturing Chen Xi and sending him to the Roc King. He never expected that the Thunderhawk King seemed to have noticed something and brazenly followed him\u2026\u201cBig Brother Yuan, wait for me.\u201d Xue Yu chased up once again, then glanced at Yuan Tong with a spurious smile on his face before saying, \u201cI, your brother, am unoccupied and have nothing to do. How about I go stay at Big Brother Yuan\u2019s place for two days?\u201dRage flashed on Yuan Tong\u2019s face, then he took a deep breath and said coldly, \u201cXue Yu, if you have something to say, then be frank. What\u2019s the point of beating around the bush?\u201dXue Yu rubbed his palms together and laughed loudly. \u201cGreat! Since Big Brother Yuan has said this, then little brother will be frank. I heard that there\u2019s still a human cultivator hidden in Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain. I wonder if it\u2019s true?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Yuan Tong\u2019s heart sank and he burst into rage. \u201cYou placed informants in my territory?\u201dXue Yu laughed and replied with a question. \u201cBig Brother Yuan, aren\u2019t you the same?\u201dYuan Tong\u2019s face froze, yet he was speechless. His territory was right next to Xue Yu\u2019s territory. For the sake of being on guard against each other, to prevent the other from taking over their territory, they\u2019d placed informants in each other\u2019s territory. This matter was something that both of them already knew.\u201cBig Brother Yuan, don\u2019t be oversensitive. I have absolutely no intention of fighting for him with you. Now that the Bloodsoul Fortune Pill only lacks one Violet Palace Realm cultivator before it can be refined, if the two of us capture this person back to the Roc King, it would surely be a great merit. Once the medicinal pills are refined, both of us will be able to obtain a little more, right?\u201d\u201cAlright, I agree. But after we capture that kid, all his possessions are mine. Otherwise, there\u2019s no room to discuss this matter any further.\u201d Yuan Tong\u2019s expression was extremely gloomy, yet he heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.\u201cBig Brother Yuan is straightforward as expected!\u201d Xue Yu laughed heartily. \u201cWith little brother helping you stand guard at the side, wouldn\u2019t that kid be captured easily?\u201d\u201cHmph! Before we capture that kid, I still have a matter to attend to. Do you want to come along?\u201d Yuan Tong\u2019s gaze flickered and revealed a jet of hatred.\u201cOf course!\u201d Xue Yu answered readily.\u2026Spiritdove Mountain.Xiong Pi was concentrating on cultivating in his abode when he suddenly felt two terrifying Perception Forces sweep pass his body, and he was suddenly terrified.\u201cXiong Pi, get the fuck out!\u201d An explosive shout abruptly resounded out, and it was like billowing thunder as it exploded out on Spiritdove Mountain, shocking the nearby demons to the point they fled hastily in all directions.Xiong Pi seemed to have expected the arrival of this day since long ago. He had a calm expression as he stood up and walked out of his abode, then gazed at the green robed, white haired young man in midair and said, \u201cBlack Ape King, you\u2019re really slow.\u201d\u201cHmph! You\u2019re still so stubborn when you\u2019re about to die.\u201d Yuan Tong looked down at Xiong Pi and said coldly, \u201cOffer up your head on your own accord. Otherwise, it will be like how I killed your younger brother that year, and I will smash you into a pool of meat pudding with a single swing of my staff!\u201d\u201cYounger brother\u2026\u201d Xiong Pi\u2019s rugged face warped, seeming like he was crying for a moment then laughing for a moment, and his stalwart body ceaselessly trembled. \u00a0He gazed at Yuan Tong who stood there in midair, his eyes were sprung open like saucers and contained a red hue yet revealed madness from extreme rage, and he roared loudly. \u201cBlack Ape King, your doom is imminent. I\u2019ll wait for you in hell, HAHAHA!\u201dIt was at this moment that a saber light that was like a bolt of lightning flashed past, instantly chopping off Xiong Pi\u2019s head. Its speed was so swift that Xiong Pi didn\u2019t even have time to react, and that enraged and insane laughter stopped abruptly along with this.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of talking so much with a madman? It will only bring disgrace to our status.\u201d Within the clouds, the Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu, appeared suddenly, then he lightly laughed as he grabbed Xiong Pi\u2019s head up from across the space and casually tossed it to Yuan Tong.Yuan Tong said coldly, \u201cI have to remind you, if you dare take my things the next time, I\u2019ll surely kill you!\u201d\u201cLooks like I\u2019ve indeed made an unnecessary move.\u201d Xue Yu laughed indifferently, and a trace of indistinct disdain flashed deep within his eyes.After a short moment, Yuan Tong returned to his own territory. Yet, he didn\u2019t stop and directly lead the 1,000 plus demons of various strengths under his command and moved towards the Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain in a formidable array.One hundred plus Congenital Realm greater demons and over a thousand minor demons gathered together were simply like a black current that surged in a formidable array through the mountain range. Demonic qi roiled and their imposing might billowed.\u201cHaha! It\u2019s still the first time that I\u2019ve battled together with so many brothers, and we even have the King to command the overall situation. Wouldn\u2019t we kill that kid to the point he wets his pants?\u201d\u201cWhy, isn\u2019t the King being too cautious? It\u2019s only killing a single human cultivator, is there any need to mobilize the forces?\u201d\u201cHmph! What do you know? This is called a show of force! The King wants to let all the greater demons and minor demons see that any fellow who dares offend him will die!\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is, the King deserves to be called farsighted and prudent.\u201d\u2026Some of these thousand plus demons still maintained their demon beast form. They were undisciplined and carefree by nature, so they naturally wouldn\u2019t be as highly disciplined as a human army. They were clamoring and making noise excitedly all along the way. Their appearance wasn\u2019t like they were going to kill an enemy, but was instead like they were going sight-seeing.\u201cWhat did you bring so many subordinates for? Could it be that we\u2019re unable to capture a single human cultivator with our cultivation?\u201d In mid air, the Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu, glanced at the ground. The unscrupulous and clamorous noise from those demons caused him to feel extreme disgust.\u201cI have my own plan.\u201d Yuan Tong answered with an expressionless face.Xue Yu smiled but said no more.Before long, the vast and imposing crowd of demons dashed to stand before Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain. They didn\u2019t rashly charge up the mountain because of Yuan Tong\u2019s restraint.Even then, such an enormous group of demons appearing near Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain had still drawn the attention of the other nearby demons.\u201cAs expected! I knew that the Black Ape King wouldn\u2019t let that human cultivator off so easily.\u201d\u201cFortunately, we left early that day and didn\u2019t form a relationship with that human cultivator. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid we wouldn\u2019t be able to escape disaster today as well.\u201d\u201cSuch a great show of strength. Could it be that the Black Ape King did this intentionally, and his objective was to make an example as a warning to others?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re doomed! The Black Ape King is finally unable to endure it and wants to purge Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain\u2026\u201dNumerous gazes looked over here in unison. Practically all these demons that cultivated near Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain knew that a Violet Palace Realm human cultivator stayed in Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain. When they saw this scene, how could they not know what was about to happen?At this moment, greater demons gathered and killing intent shot into the sky. Within a 50km radius around Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, an oppressive and murderous aura silently suffused into the air.A storm was arriving!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As he gazed at the Black Ape King and Thunderhawk King that stood loftily in midair, Mu Kui felt a chill run up his spine and unprecedented terror enveloped him, causing his entire body to shiver.\u201cSenior\u2026 Senior Chen Xi, disaster\u2026 A disaster is imminent!\u201d Mu Kui, who was almost terrified to death, screamed out as he furiously dashed towards the abode. At this moment, he could only entrust all hope on Chen Xi, even if this hope was extremely tiny.The abode\u2019s door was closed tightly, but Mu Kui was already unable to care about all that, so he pushed open the door and shouted anxiously. \u201cSenior Chen Xi\u2026\u201d His voice came to an abrupt stop.Only now did he notice that the abode was empty, and there actually wasn\u2019t a trace of Chen Xi.Mu Kui was scared out of his wits and sat on the floor with a thump. He had an ashen expression as he muttered. \u201cRight, Senior Chen Xi is only one person, yet he's surrounded by two demon kings and so many greater demons, what other way of survival is there besides fleeing?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t think of fleeing yourself?\u201d\u201cFleeing myself? Right, why didn\u2019t I think of\u2026?\u201d Mu Kui spoke halfway before seeming to be jolted awake from a dream. He gazed at the figure before him that seemed as if it had appeared out of thin air and asked with a trembling voice, \u201cSenior, you haven\u2019t left?\u201d\u201cLeave it to me. If you perceive that it\u2019s not going well, then leave as soon as possible.\u201d Chen Xi nodded. Earlier, he was cultivating the Traceless Aura technique, his aura had completely vanished and his figure was transparent, so Mu Kui was naturally unable to notice him.Mu Kui took a deep breath, then gritted his teeth and spoke. \u201cHow could I do that? I\u2019ve said before that I would follow by Senior\u2019s side for my entire lifetime!\u201d Although his expression was one of fear, it revealed a sense of staunchness and willfulness.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but moved, as he\u2019d never expected Mu Kui would actually say this, and he instantly said seriously, \u201cIf I ask you to flee, then flee! So long as you are alive, that is more important than anything!\u201dAs he spoke, Chen Xi withdrew a storage pouch and passed it to Mu Kui. \u201cThere\u2019s a qi refinement cultivation technique of mine within here, take it.\u201d\u201cSenior\u2026\u201d Mu Kui gazed at the storage pouch in his hand and he couldn\u2019t help but be dumbstruck, and inexpressible gratitude surged out from his heart. When he looked up once again, Chen Xi had already vanished within the abode.\u201cDon\u2019t worry Senior, not only will I live on, I\u2019ll become stronger!\u201d Within the abode, Mu Kui muttered to himself, and an expression of boundless firmness gushed out from his face.\u2014\u2014\u201cHe came out!\u201d\u201cThe human cultivator has come out!\u201dWaves of exclamations in surprise suddenly sounded out within the faraway mass of demons. Their gazes descended onto the same spot in unison, and there, a youth was walking over with an even pace.The young man had a tall and thin figure with a handsome appearance. Every movement of his emitted a disposition that was relaxed and had transcended the mortal world, causing him to seem extraordinary.\u201cYou\u2019re Chen Xi?\u201d High in the air, the Black Ape King abruptly shouted loudly with a voice that was like thunder, shocking the nearby demons to the point their entire body shook.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Chen Xi coldly asked rhetorically, yet he was inwardly shocked.The Black Ape King was green robed and white haired; the Thunderhawk King wore a violet coat and a pair of cold eyes, and they both stood midair. He\u2019d noticed the two of them the instant he walked out of the abode and was naturally able to guess the identity of the two. But the appearance of the Thunderhawk King still caused him to feel a trace of seriousness.Chen Xi secretly went on alert and his formidable soul covered the surroundings, as he didn\u2019t dare slack in the slightest.\u201cHmph! You\u2019re in my territory and you still dare speak like this? You really have an exaggerated opinion of your ability. Take a look first and see what this is.\u201d Yuan Tong sneered before raising his right hand, and a head appeared within his hand.This head had a hideous and distorted appearance, seeming to contain boundless rage, and when held in Yuan Tong\u2019s hand, it still dripped blood and appeared to be extremely gruesome.\u201cXiong Pi!\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s eyes squinted. His impression of Xiong Pi couldn\u2019t be considered to be good, but he extremely admired Xiong Pi\u2019s courage and resolution to take revenge for his younger brother.At this moment, when he saw the enraged and unwilling expression on Xiong Pi\u2019s head, Chen Xi felt both guilty and furious in his heart. Because of that Seventhgold Swordbamboo, he\u2019d promised Xiong Pi since long ago that he would kill the Black Ape King one day and take revenge for Xiong Pi\u2019s younger brother. But who would have expected that Xiong Pi would actually die miserably in the hands of the Black Ape King?A stream of killing intent that was burning hot like lava surged in Chen Xi\u2019s heart, and his expression became extremely icy cold.Bang!The Black Ape King squeezed his fingers together and the head exploded into powder in his hand, splattering blood all over the sky. \u201cHahaha! Are you angry? Who asked this fellow to be too rampant, he actually dared to secretly plan to kill me! He virtually possesses the same idiotic and revolting behavior as did his younger brother!\u201d\u201cThe King is correct, traitors like this deserve death!\u201d\u201cXiong Pi deserved death, otherwise, how could the King maintain his prestige?\u201d\u201cIf it was me, I\u2019d surely cut him to pieces while he\u2019s still alive, slice by slice. How could I possibly let him off so easily like the King?\u201dThe numerous demons roared, they expressions filled with bloodthirstiness and ruthlessness.In the distance, those demons that cultivated near Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain mostly had good relationships with Xiong Pi. But at this moment, they didn\u2019t have a shred of pity in their expressions and instead revealed rejoicing expressions, seeming to be rejoicing that they\u2019d cut all ties with Xiong Pi long ago.However, demons were inherently like this. They\u2019d become accustomed to the laws of the jungle while they were still wild beasts, and now that they possessed intelligence, the ruthlessness and coldness within their bones was impossible to erase.\u201cI promised Xiong Pi that I\u2019d kill you to help him take revenge for his younger brother.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s voice was cold and indifferent, yet calm, without a trace of fluctuation, seeming to be speaking of a matter of no importance. But when it entered the ears of the demons, it instead caused their hearts to go cold and they could feel the boundless killing intent within it.\u201cInteresting, the killing intent on this human cultivator is extremely strong and is obviously tempered from life and death battles.\u201d In mid air, the Thunderhawk King that had always been indifferent to everything in the surroundings seemed to have noticed something interesting, and the gaze he shot at Chen Xi carried a trace of surprise, but it quickly vanished. It was only a little fellow that had just advanced to the Violet Palace Realm, and he never took the little fellow seriously.\u201cTake revenge? I didn\u2019t hear you wrongly, right?\u201d Yuan Tong started laughing in a loud and unrestrained manner, and he gazed at Chen Xi as if he was looking at a dead person. He then said with an icy cold voice, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t busy and got delayed, do you think you\u2019d be able to live until now? Stop talking nonsense, hand over the thing Xiong Pi gifted you, then cut your own throat and commit suicide, and I\u2019ll leave your corpse intact. Otherwise\u2026\u201d\u201cKid, with just your little cultivation, you\u2019d better quickly do as my King says!\u201d\u201cA human cultivator dares speak of killing my King, aren\u2019t you afraid it will come back to haunt you?\u201d\u201cAlas, the King is really too kind hearted. If it was me, then even if he commits suicide, I\u2019d still cook his corpse and eat it! Only in this would it be satisfying!\u201dThe numerous demons chimed in as they looked at Chen Xi with gazes filled with disdain and ridicule.\u201cKill!\u201d A low and deep, icy cold voice was lightly spat out of Chen Xi\u2019s mouth. In the next instant, he\u2019d already appeared in midair, and he was like a fierce tiger dashing down a mountain as he rushed straight towards Yuan Tong with an irresistibly imposing manner.\u201cSince you\u2019re seeking death, then I\u2019ll fulfill your wish!\u201d Yuan Tong let out a savage laugh and an iron rod that was thick and heavy had already appeared in his hands. A surging bloody glow suffused the iron rod, and he directly swung his rod fiercely to greet Chen Xi.Swish!Chen Xi\u2019s body was like an extremely nimble fish as he dexterously avoided the iron rod, and the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand swiftly cut open Yuan Tong\u2019s waist.The Seventhgold Swordbamboo experienced lightning strikes every 100 years for it to grow 3cm, whereas the section of Seventhgold Swordbamboo in Chen Xi\u2019s hand was an entire one meter long. Not only was it extremely sharp, it also contained an extremely terrifying and piercingly cold energy of thunder.At this moment when he stabbed out with the sword, not only did it tear open a deep wound on the Black Ape King\u2019s waist, the thunder energy within it even surged into the wound, striking the Black Ape King to the point his body went slightly stiff and he nearly dropped down from midair.The eyes of the nearby Thunderhawk King that was watching the battle lit up and greed that couldn\u2019t be restrained arose within his heart.\u201cKid, you think you can injure me with just this?\u201dBeing injured by a single stab from Chen Xi before the eyes of so many subordinates caused the Black Ape King to be extremely furious. The wound on his waist actually healed to its former state in an instant!Chen Xi was shocked. After body refinement attained the Violet Palace Realm, the vitality of the body and lifeblood was extremely vigorous and it allowed the ability to regrow limbs. If one wanted to kill such an opponent, then the only way was to pierce through the head or heart!\u201cDie!\u201d The demonic qi on Yuan Tong\u2019s body surged and his aura swiftly skyrocketed, and his figure instead transformed into a black shadow as he lifted the almost 5,000kg iron rod in his hand before once again smashing it towards Chen Xi!Chen Xi moved up the Seventhgold Swordbamboo horizontally.Clang!A loud clang resounded out, and Chen Xi directly flew out backwards. Fortunately, this was in midair, and it allowed him to dissolve more than half of the strength behind the attack. Even then, his hands were still numbed by the shock.Chen Xi understood that he\u2019d encountered a true opponent.The Black Ape King was undoubtedly the most formidable opponent he\u2019d faced up till now!\u201cCompeting with me in strength? Hahaha\u2026 Let me see how many swings of my rod you can take!\u201d The Black Ape King roared towards the sky with laughter and his eyes were filled with bloodthirst and ruthlessness. Then, he took large strides as he charged forward with a billowing imposing manner. As the rod in his hand swept through the sky, it emitted a breathtaking sound before fiercely pounding at Chen Xi. The strength exerted on the iron rod had obviously increased a considerable amount from before.Swoosh!How could Chen Xi continue taking it head-on? His figure swayed as he executed the Divine Windwing Flight. It seemed as if a pair of wings that were condensed from a gale had appeared behind him, and his speed was swift like a bolt of lightning. He was like the wind that contained a myriad of extraordinary changes as he ceaselessly altered his direction, and the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand repeatedly attacked Yuan Tong with an extraordinarily swift speed.Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!Under the combination of sword technique and movement technique that contained Dao Insight, thousands of wounds that dripped with blood had instantly been cut out on Yuan Tong\u2019s body, and his condition was terrifying.Below Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain and a distance away from Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, all the demons watched with wide eyes and expressions of disbelief.\u201cSword Insight! Movement Insight! Not good! This youth\u2019s cultivation in the Martial Dao has already attained the Dao Insight Stage!\u201d The Thunderhawk King who crossed his arms and observed the fight was unable to maintain his composure any longer and his expression abruptly became grim.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Black Ape King possessed a body refining cultivation at the 4th star of the Violet Palace Realm and had already attained the Violet Palace Realm a thousand years ago. His cultivation could be said to be incomparably powerful, and this was also the fundamental reason he was able to become one of the seven great demon kings.However, at this moment, the Black Ape King was completely suppressed by Chen Xi!\u201cChen Xi undoubtedly only advanced to the Violet Palace Realm a few months ago!\u201d Mu Kui muttered in excitement and he already didn\u2019t know how to express the excited feeling in his heart at this moment.Swish! Swish! Swish!Chen Xi\u2019s figure was extremely nimble like the wind. the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand was even swifter, to the point the eye was unable to catch a trace of it. It was like wave after wave of tidewater that left behind numerous blood colored sword wounds on the Black Ape King\u2019s body.At this moment, Chen Xi seemed to have returned to the time he trained bitterly in that sea of bamboo, gritting his teeth as he practiced time and time again under the repeated stimulation of Ji Yu\u2019s remark \u2018Not good enough!\u2019 He only stopped when he had completely exhausted the last strand of strength in his entire body. All for the sake of being able to shuttle back and forth a single time in the sea of bamboo within the time of ten breaths.Not touching a bamboo leaf, not touching the bamboo stem. Such an infuriatingly harsh requirement caused him to seem so skillful and at ease when he dodged the Black Ape King\u2019s rod at this moment, virtually like he was taking an idle stroll in a garden, yet swiftly like the wind.Whereas his sword technique had instead obtained tempering bit by bit in this life and death battle, and the sword\u2019s force that contained Wind Insight became even swifter and fiercer\u2026Traces of comprehension emerged within his heart, and Chen Xi\u2019s live combat standard improved along with his increased comprehension.The Black Ape King felt extremely aggrieved, as no matter how he swung about his iron rod, it was just unable to hit Chen Xi, and was even unable to touch Chen Xi\u2019s sleeves; whereas he instead received numerous bloody wounds from Chen Xi\u2019s sword. Although these wounds quickly recovered flawlessly, he could only tenaciously defend his weak spots, and such a passive position of taking a beating caused him to furious to the limit!\u201cDammit! Dammit! Fucking hell!\u201d The Black Ape King fell into a frenzied state. His height rose explosively by 10m and jet-black fur gushed out of the surface of his body, piece by piece of muscles that were like rocks bulged up, and his eyes went red as his fangs shot out.Around the Black Ape King who\u2019d returned to his beast form, a brutal energy that was mixed with billowing demonic qi suffused out with a bang.Crackle! Crackle!Boundless blood colored lights abruptly surged out from the iron rod in the Black Ape King\u2019s hand. The colored lights were dense and bloody, and there seemed to be countless vengeful spirits struggling within them. The instant it appeared in the air, the energy that was violent and cruel caused the hearts of every demon present to go cold.\u201cThe King is furious! How many years has it been? It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m seeing him return to his beast form, and the first time I\u2019m seeing him utilize the Demonic Vengeful Blood Rod in his possession!\u201d\u201cThat human kid is too detestable and only knows how to dodge. If the King doesn\u2019t use his trump card, then that kid would think that the King is afraid of him!\u201d\u201cHaha! That kid is dead for sure!\u201dWhen the crowd of greater demons saw the Black Ape King using his full strength, the worry within their heart was completely wiped clean and they once again started exclaiming loudly.The Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu, stroked his chin as he secretly considered, and he also secretly heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Chen Xi\u2019s display had greatly exceeded his expectations. The Seventhgold Swordbamboo in Chen Xi\u2019s possession, his movement technique and sword technique that had attained the Dao Insight Stage had all caused him to be extremely afraid.The Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu, was a Golden Ironhawk adept in speed that had taken human form, and his body innately contained a stand of thunder energy. Although his cultivation was much higher than Chen Xi, if they were to enter into combat, then besides his speed being able to compete with Chen Xi, he was practically suppressed by Chen Xi in every other aspect.Utilize thunder techniques?Chen Xi possessed a Seventhgold Swordbamboo that was innately unafraid of thunder. Moreover, if used well, it could even absorb thunder!However, Xue Yu had lived for thousands of years after all, and he possessed various trump card Magic Treasures. So if they really entered into battle, he wasn\u2019t afraid of Chen Xi either.\u201cDie!\u201d Right when Xue Yu\u2019s thoughts were flying, the Black Ape King swung the iron rod in his hand. Swoosh! Boundless blood colored lights surged out with a bang, like a surging blood colored river that roared and howled as if swallowed towards Chen Xi.Whoo-oo-oo-oo\u2026Accompanying the ghastly and sharp wailing and howling of ghosts, the surrounding world became incomparably gloomy, and numerous vengeful spirits that could be seen with the naked eye whistled in the air as they flew out. These vengeful spirits were all formidable demon beasts that were tortured to death and contained terrifying resentment, then they were tempered within the Demonic Vengeful Blood Rod by Yuan Tong for a thousand years, causing these vengeful spirits to seem material and extremely terrifying. If it was a person who wasn\u2019t mentally firm, then their souls would probably be instantly seized and captured.\u201cRoar!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThe countless vengeful spirits emitted shrill howls as they surged towards Chen Xi while blotting out the sky and the earth.\u201cPu!\u201d Yuan Tong, who\u2019d completely fallen into a frenzied state, opened his mouth and spat a mouthful of blood essence onto the Demonic Vengeful Blood Rod, and even more vengeful spirits surged out with a bang from the stimulation of his blood, practically completely blotting out the entire heavens and earth!\u201cHahaha! Let me see how you dodge now!\u201d Spitting out a mouthful of blood essence and controlling the Demonic Vengeful Blood Rod in his hand caused Yuan Tong\u2019s face to become incomparably pale. But as he gazed at Chen Xi who was completely and tightly surrounded by the vengeful spirits, he still couldn\u2019t refrain from emitting wild and frenzied laughter.As Chen Xi gazed at the swarm of vengeful spirits that charged at him like tidewater, his expression couldn\u2019t help but go grim. Vengeful spirits were shapeless objects and they were completely impossible to be stopped by relying solely on ordinary methods.Crackle!Right at the moment Chen Xi\u2019s expression became more and more serious, a strand of a thunder arc abruptly surged out from the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand. It directly struck the vengeful spirit beside him to death, completely reducing it to ashes!Chen Xi\u2019s eyes lit up and he poured his True Essence into the Seventhgold Swordbamboo.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!The sword lights were like violent waves that swept away the tide, and in the blink of an eye, a myriad of sword images had already transformed into layer upon layer of sword shadows that splashed out. The sword\u2019s might was forceful and unrestrained, sweeping out together like a myriad of enormous waves that overlapped each other as they swept through the heavens and the earth.The Windflow Divination Sword\u2019s Tide Squall!Hiss! Crackle! Hiss! Crackle!Waves of sounds that were like fire scorching rose and fell, and Chen Xi\u2019s figure was covered within a myriad of sword lights. Every sword light he stabbed out had a strand of a dazzling arc of thunder surging out from it, and everywhere it passed the vengeful spirits weren\u2019t even able to react when they were torn apart and burnt into nothingness.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why, why is it like this?\u201d The smile on Yuan Tong\u2019s face froze abruptly, then it was replaced with an expression of shock and rage. The vengeful spirits within the Demonic Vengeful Blood Rod were his trump card, and they were always successful! But when he saw Chen Xi successively annihilating large groups of vengeful spirits with extreme ease, he was completely unable to believe his eyes.\u201cIt can\u2019t be. These vengeful spirits were personally tortured to death by me, then tempered with baleful qi for almost a thousand years. They\u2019d become unafraid of all Magic Treasures and weapons since long ago. How could they possibly become so weak?\u201dYuan Tong\u2019s expression warped and fluttered between various expression, yet he still wasn\u2019t able to believe it.It was at this time.Silently, a sword light that was swift like lightning seemed to have torn through space as it suddenly approached, its speed was so swift then when Yuan Tong had just recovered from his shock, it had already arrived before his face.\u201cNo!\u201d Boundless unwillingness surged out from Yuan Tong\u2019s heart, yet it was already too late to dodge. A bloody hole directly pierced between his brows.Even though the Violet Palace Realm of body refinement was capable of regrowing limbs, so long as the head or a weak point was crushed, then one would die without a doubt.Whoosh!Another sword light flashed past, and Yuan Tong\u2019s head was cut off, dropping into a long and strong hand.At this moment, not a sound could be heard!All of the demons stared blankly at the headless corpse that was falling down from mid air as if they\u2019d seen a nightmare that was completely outside of their expectations. Their bodies and minds were all in a state of shock and bewilderment!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 Thousandhawk Grand FormationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72 \u2013 Thousandhawk Grand FormationXue Yu\u2019s had a serious expression. He\u2019d originally intended to lend a hand, but Chen Xi\u2019s sword technique was too fast. It was to the extent that when the thought of saving the Black Ape King had only just arisen within his heart, Yuan Tong\u2019s head had already been pierced through by Chen Xi\u2019s sword.Xue Yu\u2019s heart rose and fell rhythmically, it was truly difficult for Xue Yu to imagine how this human youth was able to advance his cultivation in the Martial Dao to the Dao Insight Stage so quickly when he\u2019d only just advanced to the Violet Palace Realm not long ago. After all, most Violet Palace Realm cultivators only had a cultivation in the Martial Dao at the unity stage.At this moment, Xue Yu didn\u2019t dare look down on Chen Xi any longer.\u2014\u2014Mu Kui felt his state of mind today was like a rising and falling tide. Up to the moment that Chen Xi killed the Black Ape King, he was already excited to the point he clenched his fists and wanted to shout loudly, yet he felt that no words were able to express the current excitement in his heart.The mountain winds whistled and demonic qi still billowed like dark clouds, but along with the death of the Black Ape King, Yuan Tong, all the demon-kind present had already fallen into extreme shock.As they gazed at the youth that carried the Black Ape King\u2019s head, the hearts of these demon-kind that embraced the law of the jungle and respecting strength were filled with terror, and they looked at Chen Xi with fearful gazes that carried traces of reverence.\u201cHe deserved to die for torturing so many souls to death!\u201d An indifferent voice drifted in the air. Chen Xi gazed at the head of the Black Ape King that he held within his hand. As he gazed at the expression of astonishment and disbelief within Yuan Tong\u2019s bloodthirsty eyes at the moment before Yuan Tong\u2019s death, Chen Xi shook his head and exerted force in his fingers, crushing Yuan Tong\u2019s head with a \u2018crack.\u2019Xiong Pi\u2019s head was crushed by Yuan Tong\u2019s hands, so Chen Xi crushed Yuan Tong\u2019s head with his hands. It was as if only by doing this was Chen Xi able to cause the guilt in his heart to reduce slightly, and only then would he be able to hold a memorial for Xiong Pi who\u2019d died a long time ago.\u201cMu Kui, gather up the treasures in the Black Ape King\u2019s possession.\u201d Chen Xi swept the surroundings with his gaze then instructed indifferently before shooting his gaze towards the distant Thunderhawk King.\u201cHonestly speaking, your strength greatly exceeded my expectations.\u201d The Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu, had a relaxed expression as he shrugged and said, \u201cHowever, I\u2019m sorry to say that you aren\u2019t a match for me.\u201dChen Xi didn\u2019t speak. His gaze stared fixedly at the Thunderhawk King and he felt a trace of heavy pressure from the Thunderhawk King, pressure that was completely different from when he faced the Black Ape King.Chen Xi had heard Mu Kui mention it before, amongst the seven great demon kings, the Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu, possessed a strength that was even more terrifying than the Black Ape King and the Sunset Forest\u2019s Azure Python King. The crux of it all was because Xue Yu was an ancient variant Golden Ironhawk that had taken human form. His speed was exceptionally swift and was innately capable of accumulating the energy of thunder within his body, causing him to be immensely formidable.However, Chen Xi wasn\u2019t afraid either, and he even wanted to give it a try. Was the Thunderhawk King\u2019s speed swifter in the end, or was his own Divine Windwing Flight swifter?\u201cEarlier, if I joined forces with the old ape, you would surely be dead right now, whereas the reason you\u2019re alive until now is actually extremely simple, it\u2019s because I want you to hand over the Seventhgold Swordbamboo on your own accord.\u201d Xue Yu completely disregarded the killing intent in Chen Xi\u2019s gaze and said with a smile, \u201cI don\u2019t like to kill, but if you\u2019re too obstinate, then I might\u2026\u201d\u201cNoisy!\u201d Chen Xi interrupted him before the Thunderhawk King could finish, then his body swayed as the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand slashed at the Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu.Om! Om! Om!It was like fine and soft wind had coiled together to flutter about happily as strands and threads of sword lights tore through the sky, and they instantly formed an enormous net sown together from a myriad of sword lights.The Windflow Divination Sword\u2019s Breezy Rain! The sword force was fine and continuously lingering, seeming to be gentle like a drizzle, yet killing intent was concealed within it. It was extremely suitable to be used against the Thunderhawk King that was adept in speed.However, the Thunderhawk King seemed to completely off guard, but in truth, he\u2019d been secretly on guard for a while now. The instant that Chen Xi made a move, the Thunderhawk King\u2019s figure was like a bolt of lightning as he flashed towards the distance with a \u2018swish,\u2019 and he was already 300 meters away in the blink of an eye.\u201cChen Xi, follow me if you have the balls!\u201d The Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu, roared in laughter from 300 meters in the distance. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth, we\u2019ve already capture eight human cultivators in these past few days. I think they\u2019re called Du Qingxi and Murong Wei. They ought to be your friends, right? If you want to save them, then defeat me first, or perhaps obediently hand over the Seventhgold Swordbamboo!\u201dChen Xi was stunned and he couldn\u2019t help but recall the various scenes in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin were his friends, even if there was a misunderstanding between them. When he heard the news that they might have met with misfortune now, he still felt a shred of anxiousness.These thoughts flashed within Chen Xi\u2019s mind in the blink of an eye. Chen Xi\u2019s figure sped out right away, and a pair of wings seemed to have grown out of his back as he chased after the distant Thunderhawk King.\u201cYou\u2019re truly courting death! My hawk-kind are the kings that reign supreme in the air!\u201d The Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu, lightly smiled, and a trace of cold killing intent flashed within his eyes.Swoosh! Swoosh!One chasing after the other, Chen Xi and Xue Yu seemed like two bolts of lightning in hot pursuit, and they vanished under the sky in the blink of an eye.\u2026Mu Kui gazed at the tall and thin figure that had vanished in the sky, yet he wasn\u2019t worried, as he firmly believed that Chen Xi wouldn\u2019t be defeated. It was a belief without reason.At this moment, he\u2019d walked with a swagger to arrive before the group of greater demons, then bent down and gathered the treasures on the corpse of the Black Ape King according to Chen Xi\u2019s instructions.\u201cOh, 1,500kg of spirit liquid, one piece of Crimsonflame Firesteel, a string of thousand year Tempersoul Fruit\u2026\u201d At this moment, Mu Kui was simply arrogant to the limit, his hands fumbled about the Black Ape King\u2019s corpse, and didn\u2019t pay attention in the slightest to the practically killing gazes that were shot at him from the surroundings.The 1,000 plus demons that had followed the Black Ape King over had long been scared shitless by Chen Xi\u2019s formidable combat strength, and now that the Black Ape King was dead, like how monkeys would scatter when a tree fell, they wouldn\u2019t foolishly go offend Mu Kui.As they heard the extremely enticing names of various materials, and as they gazed at Mu Kui\u2019s greedy and repulsive appearance, the expressions of all these demons were extremely unsightly.After a long time, Mu Kui confirmed that he couldn\u2019t \u00a0discover any more treasures from Yuan Tong\u2019s corpse, and only now did he smack his lips and stand up, then returned to Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain with a leisurely and carefree manner.\u201cFellow Daoist Mu Kui has returned?\u201d\u201cAh, we haven\u2019t met for a long time, Fellow Daoist Mu Kui\u2019s cultivation seems to have progressed, congratulations!\u201d\u201cAlas, Fellow Daoist Mu Kui, I\u2019ve come to apologize to you, I\u2019ve been busy cultivating these past few days and had forgotten to pay a visit to you, it\u2019s truly a sin.\u201dWhen Mu Kui returned to the abode on Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, there was a group of greater demons waiting for a while now. These greater demons were all the demons that cultivated nearby Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, and most of them had come to congratulate Chen Xi when he advanced to the Violet Palace Realm. When they saw Mu Kui return, all of them swarmed over familiarly with various shameless flattery and various inquiries that showed great concern. They were simply brimming with enthusiasm.\u201cAll of you leave, I have to guard the abode for Senior Chen Xi.\u201d Mu Kui had an expressionless face as he swept the demons with his gaze, and he snorted disdainfully in his heart.\u2014\u2014Groups of mountains rose and fell, mist and clouds billowed.Under the faraway blue sky, two flowing lights instantly flashed by. Their speed was so swift that they sliced the clouds and mist in the sky to the point they roiled and dispersed, forming an extremely striking wave of air behind them.50km.250km.500km.\u2026The Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu, who\u2019d already returned to his beast form of a Golden Ironhawk, flapped his wings and was extremely shocked inwardly. He didn\u2019t have to look back to know from the sound of air exploding that gradually became sharp, Chen Xi was behind him and slowly approaching.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!The instant the Thunderhawk King was dazed, a sharp whistling sound of air exploding suddenly sounded out from behind him, then numerous sword lights that contained unparalleled Sword Insight tore through space as it flew towards him.He hurriedly changed his direction to dodge these sword lights that caused him to be extremely afraid in his heart, and he didn\u2019t dare allow his thoughts to run wild anymore as he concentrated his vigor to fly forward.Swoosh!The Thunderhawk King\u2019s wings flapped rapidly, once again increasing his speed by a great deal, and he instantly pulled open the distance between him and Chen Xi, yet wanting to completely throw Chen Xi off was utterly impossible to achieve.Chasing up to this point caused Chen Xi to vaguely guess that the Thunderhawk King seemed to want to lure him to a place, and utterly didn\u2019t intend on carrying out a life and death battle with him.Chen Xi pondered strenuously. Chen Xi\u2019s speed was indeed not slower in the slightest as the Divine Windwing Flight that contained a strand of Wind Dao Insight was exerted to the limit by him, and he was like a strand of drifting and traceless swift wind that was like a bolt of lightning.After the time for an incense stick to burn.The Thunderhawk King stopped abruptly, then he unfolded his wings and rapidly dove downwards.\u201cThis place is?\u201d Chen Xi stopped in tow, then he swept his gaze downwards. He saw a mountain that was coiled within violet gas standing towering there. It was entirely like a sword, precipitous and steep, and on the side of the precipice an enormous palace was shockingly built there!This palace seemed to be completely made of a violet metal and was peerlessly exquisite. Within it, pavilions, artificial mountains, and streams could be seen everywhere, to the extent that there was even a lake with rippling blue water.\u201cChildren, quickly form the Thousandhawk Grand Formation with your ancestor and kill this human youth!\u201d The Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu, stood above the palace and suddenly shouted out explosively.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 Battling The Thunderhawk KingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73 \u2013 Battling The Thunderhawk KingIn the wake of Xue Yu\u2019s explosive shout, countless black shadows abruptly shot into the sky from the palace at the side of the precipice.Shriek! Shriek! Shriek!Sharp and ear piercing bird cries were like tidewater as they resounded in the heaven and the earth. Those numerous black shadows were 6m wide Golden Ironhawks. Their feathers were like iron armor, beaks like swords, and claws like hooks; the thousands of them flapped their wings as they came from all over to form a six layered and perfectly round design.Whereas the Thunderhawk King instead stood arrogantly at the exact center of the circle.\u201cColossal Copper Mountain \u2014 Rise!\u201d Xue Yu made a raising gesture in the air and a 30,000 meter high mountain that was suffused with violet lights appeared out of thin air!Swish! Swish!Billowing violet gas suffused the heavens and the earth. Within this roiling violet gas, the mountain that was already floating midair started to shrink at a visible speed, transforming into a 30cm high mini-mountain in the blink of an eye. The mini mountain was completely overflowing with violet gas and the aura of a treasure shot into the sky!\u201cHahaha, this Colossal Copper Mountain is 500,000kg heavy and was refined by me using a Secret Technique for 3,000 years. It\u2019s able to shrink and expand at will, and when it smashes, you\u2019ll be turned into powder even if you have a body of iron!\u201d Xue Yu maintained his hand in a position of the raising gesture from before as he gestured as if holding up the little mountain that surged with violet gas, then roared with laughter at the sky. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s only semi-finished, its might is comparable to a top-grade earth-rank Magic Treasure! Chen Xi, today, you will die without a doubt\u2026 Eh, where is he?\u201dThe Thunderhawk King fully scanned his surroundings, but he only saw the clear sky. Where was there any trace of Chen Xi within the completely empty space?\u201cCould it be that this damnable fellow fled? It was so difficult for me to fucking lure that fellow here, then place a Thousandhawk Greater Formation and employ my trump card Magic Treasure, the Colossal Copper Mountain. How could he flee without saying a word?\u201d Xue Yu\u2019s face flickered between a livid and grim countenance. He\u2019d lured Chen Xi all the way here, yet didn\u2019t attack all along because he knew he was unable to suppress Chen Xi in speed, and secondly, he was rather afraid of the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in Chen Xi\u2019s possession. That Seventhgold Swordbamboo just happened to be the counter to the thunder energy within his body, so he had no choice but to approach it with caution.This also allowed him to understand that if he wanted to quickly kill the human youth that possessed extraordinary speed, he could only restrain the youths speed so that he could crush the youth in one go with an irresistible force.Furthermore, it just so happened that the Magic Treasure in his possession, the Colossal Copper Mountain, was able to form a 330m area gravitational field once utilized. Anything that entered within the gravitational field would encounter a terrifying gravity of almost 5,000kg that was just like a person was carrying a small mountain on his shoulder, and the person's speed would surely be extremely affected. It was to the extent that if one was caught off guard within the gravitational field, then one would instantly be squeezed by the terrifying gravity to the point their body exploded!However, this Colossal Copper Mountain was only semi-finished. If he were to battle Chen Xi, then the Thunderhawk King could only put his heart and soul in controlling the Colossal Copper Mountain and he would be unable to divert his attention to kill Chen Xi.It was precisely because of this that the Thunderhawk King ordered his subordinates to form the Thousandhawk Greater Formation, as he intended to order them to attack Chen Xi.All of this was prepared according to plan, yet Chen Xi just happened to have gone missing!\u201cEven if his speed was any faster, it was still impossible for him to vanish within my field of vision in the blink of an eye. Could it be that he\u2019s concealed somewhere nearby right now?\u201d When he thought of this, the Thunderhawk King Xue Yu released his Perception Force and instantly swept the nearby vicinity, yet he didn\u2019t notice a shred of Chen Xi\u2019s aura.\u201cImpossible! How can my fucking painstaking effort be wasted just like this?\u201dSwoosh!Xue Yu was unable to restrain the depression in his heart any longer, he flapped his wings and rushed into the sky, then stood high in the sky as he scanned the surroundings. As a hawk demon beast, his gaze was extremely sharp and was able to clearly see every small thing in an area of 50km.\u201cDamnable fellow, you\u2019ve fled faster than anyone\u2026\u201d Xue Yu was furious and broke out into curses, however, right at that moment, a tiny feeling of danger caused a chill to run down his spine and swiftly surged into his heart.His expression abruptly went pale. A steel trident that contained oppressive bright lights suddenly appeared within his right hand and he blocked before himself out of pure instinct.Kacha!A wisp of a sword image swiftly appeared, easily slicing the steel trident into two, and its remaining force didn\u2019t reduce as it swept towards Xue Yu\u2019s neck.Moreover, at this moment, Chen Xi\u2019s figure had appeared out of thin air, one meter beside Xue Yu, and the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his right hand was swift like lightning, peerlessly swift and fierce.This scene scared the Thunderhawk King half to death. His wings flapped just like a pair of shields that had joined together, blocking his chest at the extremely critical moment.Rip!An enormous wound broke open on the wings of the Thunderhawk King that were hard like iron, and blood gushed out with a \u2018whoosh\u2019 as feathers scattered all over the sky.\u201cDammit! I was actually sneak attacked by that fellow!\u201d The Thunderhawk King snorted in frustration, his body staggered and he nearly fell from the sky. He didn\u2019t dare stay here any longer as his heavily injured wings would affect his speed, so he wanted to return to the Thousandhawk Grand Formation. Only by controlling the Colossal Copper Mountain would he be able to turn around this unfavorable situation.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!Chen Xi concealed himself midair with the Traceless Aura Technique, and had waited for this superb opportunity with great difficulty, how could he allow the Thunderhawk King to flee? Instantly, he willed it in his heart, and eight flying swords that were suffused with dense cold lights appeared out of thin air and flew out like a flowing light, instantly locking down all Xue Yu\u2019s paths of retreat.These eight flying swords were obtained by Chen Xi from within the chasm in the Crimsonflame Mountain Range of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. They were previously used by the immortal, Nether Enlightenment, to maintain the Baleful Condensation Formation, and their quality were at the ranks of the top-grade yellow-rank. At this moment, when controlled by Chen Xi, cold lights surged out for a moment as spirit energy flowed around it, and its sharp sword qi abruptly swarmed the sky.\u201cDammit, this fellow actually possesses a graded Magic Treasure? He clearly only advanced to the Violet Palace Realm a little while ago, where did he get so many treasures?\u201d The Thunderhawk King\u2019s face swiftly went pale as he suddenly noticed that he seemed to have been wrong since the beginning.Om!A sound of swords that were like a dragon\u2019s roar and a crane\u2019s cry echoed out, under the control of Chen Xi\u2019s formidable Perception Force, the tips of the eight flying swords faced downwards as they twisted towards the Thunderhawk King in the center.At the same time, Chen Xi\u2019s mind still wasn\u2019t at ease, and the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand was like a typhoon, as pure Sword Insight mixed with an aura of annihilation that would destroy everything tore through the sky towards Xue Yu.The sixth move of the Windflow Divination Sword \u2014 Space Shattering Typhoon!The cry of swords rose and fell like waves, and it was like the footsteps of the god of death was approaching step by step.As he felt the extremely terrifying force of destruction surging over from every direction, the Thunderhawk King was already scared shitless. His figure was like an ephemeral shadow as he fled downwards with a \u2018swish.\u2019 However, he was forcefully driven back to where he stood earlier by the eight Netherezim Swords that surrounded him, and his face couldn\u2019t help but abruptly go pale as he roared with all his strength. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill me! Could it be that you don\u2019t want to know the information about your friends?\u201d\u201cDie!\u201d Chen Xi instead turned a deaf ear to it. The Seventhgold Swordbamboo was the last to be swung out, yet the first to arrive. The unparalleled Sword Insight contained within seemed to revolve like a millstone, instantly mincing the Thunderhawk King into a mush of blood and meat that sprinkled down profusely and disorderly from the sky like a rain of blood.Up to this point, besides the Black Ape King, another demon king from the seven great demon kings had perished under Chen Xi\u2019s sword!\u201cOnly demon kings like you are able to capture them, so why should I ask you for their whereabouts again?\u201d Chen Xi gazed at the remains of the Thunderhawk King that sprinkled down like rain, and he finally heaved a long sigh of relief.Killing the Black Ape King, then traveling a long way to annihilate the Thunderhawk King had caused Chen Xi\u2019s True Essence to be on the verge of exhaustion, and his mind was extremely exhausted. After all, being slightly careless in a life and death battle against a stronger opponent would likely lead to death on the spot. If it wasn\u2019t for his body being extremely tough, he would have probably been unable to sustain himself any longer.\u201cThat human youth has killed the King!\u201d\u201cThe King is actually dead! How could this be possible?\u201d\u201cWhat should we do? Do we seek vengeance for the King?\u201dDue to the battle ending so swiftly, those thousand over Golden Ironhawks has only awoken from what seemed like a dream now, and they let out surprised exclamations with voices that were filled with terror and disappointment.\u201cScram!\u201d Chen Xi coldly spat out a word. Killing intent was condensed between his brows and he was like an unfeeling deity of slaughter, scaring the thousand plus feathered animals out of their minds with a single glance. At once, they didn\u2019t dare hesitate any longer. All of them spread their wings and fled in panic, and their appearances were as if they wished for nothing more than their parents to have borne them with\u2026 an extra pair of wings!Swoosh! Swoosh!Chen Xi descended from midair when he confirmed that there weren\u2019t any demon-kind in the vicinity any longer, and he supported himself with the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand as he panted heavily.After resting for a short moment and slightly recovering some physical strength, Chen Xi walked a short distance to pick up a storage belt from the ground. He was slightly disappointed once he roughly sized it up. There was an entire 330m worth of space within the storage belt. Gold and jewels like agate and jade were placed in half of it; they were all things that were extremely expensive in the mortal world and were piled up there like mountain after mountain of gold and silver. Whereas various spirit herbs, spirit woods, ores, and materials were piled in the other half, and all of them shone with extremely bright lights and were surrounded by misty treasure qi.\u201cThe quality of these materials are extraordinary and there\u2019re more than 10,000 types. I wonder how much spirit liquid I can obtain from exchanging them? What\u2019s unfortunate is that there actually isn\u2019t a single complete Magic Treasure. The wealth of this Thunderhawk King is too disgraceful.\u201d Chen Xi shook his head and his gaze glanced thoughtlessly around. He couldn\u2019t help but light up as he saw that a 30cm tall small mountain overflowing with violet gas was still left behind nearby.\u201cAccording to the Thunderhawk King, this small mountain is called Colossal Copper Mountain, its 500,000kg heavy and was refined by him using a Secret Technique for 3,000 years. It\u2019s able to shrink and expand at will, and it\u2019s only semi-finished, yet its might is comparable to a top-grade earth-rank Magic Treasure. I wonder if it\u2019s true or not\u2026?\u201d These thoughts flashed within Chen Xi\u2019s mind, then he stretched out his hand to pick up the Colossal Copper Mountain on the ground. Unexpectedly, despite him exerting his full strength, he was still unable to move it in the slightest.\u201cThe strength of my body already possess a cultivation at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm and I can snatch up something over 5,000kg with a single arm, yet I\u2019m unable to snatch up this tiny 30cm tall mountain? Looks like this thing really is an extraordinary treasure!\u201d Not only was Chen Xi not discouraged, he instead became even more excited. He didn\u2019t hesitate anymore and shot out a strand of True Essence from his palm right away, then started binding the little mountain.The Thunderhawk King was already dead, so this little mountain had become an item with no master, and he only had to wipe off the mental brand on the top before it could be used by him.\u201cWhat a treasure!\u201d After a short moment, Chen Xi opened his eyes abruptly, and a wisp of wonder surged out from his eyes as he gazed at the little mountain that revolved as it floated atop his palm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 A Chance Encounter of Old FriendsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74 \u2013 A Chance Encounter of Old FriendsThe Colossal Copper Mountain was refined from an almost 3,000 meter tall copper mountain and was 500,000kg in weight. Pure Violet mist Baleful Qi was accumulated within the entire mountain, and when utilized, it was able to form an enormous gravitational field that was extremely formidable. When a person was within the gravitational field, it was like an enormous mountain bearing down on the person, and the pressure on the person would skyrocket. If it was someone with a slightly inferior strength, they would be instantly crushed into a pool of mush.\u201cA semi-finished Magic Treasure is able to possess the might of a top-grade earth-rank Magic Treasure. If it\u2019s completely refined to success, what level of grade and rank would it attain?\u201d Chen Xi gazed at the 30 cm tall little mountain that endlessly revolved around and around on the center of his palm, and was fond of it to the point he was unwilling to let go. \u201cHowever, this might is already sufficient for me. Fortunately, it\u2019s a semi-finished Magic Treasure. If it was any more formidable, then I\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to control it as well.\u201dOrdinarily, man-made yellow-rank, profound-rank, earth-rank, and heaven-rank and their various grades of Magic Treasures had a certain requirement to True Essence. For example, an earth-rank Magic Treasure required at least a Golden Core Realm cultivation to bind it, a heaven-rank Magic Treasure required at least a Rebirth Realm cultivation to bind it. By no means was the possession of a Magic Treasure with an extremely high rank and grade able to allow a cultivator to become a peerless expert in one go.\u201cHmm? That enormous palace at the side of the precipice ought to be the Thunderhawk King\u2019s lair, there might be other treasures within it.\u201d After tossing the Colossal Copper Mountain into his storage ring, Chen Xi looked up and noticed the matchlessly exquisite palace, and he thought in his heart right away before leaping up and flashing over. He was like an arrow piercing through the wind and was already standing before palace after a short moment.\u201cSkysoar Hall? What lofty sentiments from this Thunderhawk King.\u201d Chen Xi glanced at the large gilded board that hung at the center of the palace and he shook his head before going through the door right away.Along with the death of the Thunderhawk King, Xue Yu, all the demons under his command had fled. Presently, the palace was extremely silent, like a luxurious tomb built after the death of kings and princes, and was deathly still.Chen Xi had always been using his Perception Force to carefully search all along the way, yet after taking a circle through numerous winding pavilions, then passing through numerous artificial hills and flowing water, he didn\u2019t discover a single valuable treasure that could move him and couldn\u2019t help but be bewildered. \u201cStrange, the palace of the Thunderhawk King is so luxurious, how can there not be a single valuable thing?\u201dRight at this moment, a low and feeble voice sounded out abruptly. \u201cThe movement outside has stopped, could it be that Thunderhawk King is already dead?\u201dChen Xi slightly distinguished the source of the voice and arrived behind an artificial mountain right away. Under the cover of the verdant grass and moss was shockingly an entrance that could allow a person to pass. Steps circled downwards one by one, seeming to be leading deep into the ground, and that voice had come from within.\u201cThis palace is built on the side of the precipice, based on this, this hole in the ground ought to lead to within the mountainside.\u201d Chen Xi pondered for a moment, then carefully walked in. He wanted to see what was actually below and whether the person who spoke earlier was human or demon.After walking for 15 minutes within the gloomy and damp narrow path, Chen Xi arrived at a spacious place that was dark, with only a few scattered shark oil lanterns that were dim and tiny hung on the wall.Gloomy, damp, and stuffy, the entire space was filled with a nauseating air of death. Mixed within it was some dense and pungent smell of blood, causing its environment to be extremely disgusting.This was obviously a prison!Chen Xi\u2019s gaze swept the surroundings, and he noticed there were numerous cramped stone rooms 330meters in the distance. The door to the stone rooms were numerous dark steel pillars that were as thick as a human leg, tightly sealing up the stone room.\u201cDammit! The Thunderhawk King is incomparably cunning. If it wasn\u2019t for him suddenly utilizing that violet colored mountain that revolved with gravity, how could we have possibly been locked up here? It\u2019s for the best if he\u2019s dead, perhaps then we can even be rescued.\u201d\u201cBig Brother Chai is right. I wonder who the fellow that the Thunderhawk King was battling actually is? If he\u2019s able to righteously rescue us both, then it couldn\u2019t be any better.\u201d\u2026Seeming to have not noticed Chen Xi\u2019s arrival, a wave of low and deep sounds of conversation sounded out within the gloomy stone room like underground mice whispering in discussion.However, when he heard these two voices clearly, Chen Xi\u2019s heart shook and he shouted in a low voice. \u201cChai Letian, Yu Haobai?\u201d\u201cWho!?\u201d\u201cWho? You actually recognize me, Chai Letian? Could it be a Fellow Daoist?\u201d Two exclamations of surprise sounded out from within the stone room, seeming to be extremely excited.A cold light flashed within Chen Xi\u2019s eyes. When they were at the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, Chai Letian had made things difficult for him at every corner and had even launched a surprise attack at him from behind. Being caught off guard, Chen Xi was thrown into the chasm at Crimsonflame Mountain Range. If it wasn\u2019t for his body having attained the Congenital Realm, he probably would have been smashed to pieces long ago.He\u2019d always remembered this grudge in his heart, how could he possibly forget? The instant he fell into the chasm, he\u2019d already sworn that he would surely kill this shameless and despicable fellow in his lifetime.Whereas at this moment, being able to encounter Chai Letian who was trapped within the stone room was simply like a gift from the heavens, forcing Chen Xi to sigh with emotion.\u201cShit! It\u2019s that fellow Chen Xi!\u201d\u201cAh, no wonder he sounded so familiar\u2026 Wait, Chen Xi? How could it be him?\u201dWithin the stone room, Chai Letian and Yu Haobai seemed to have recognized Chen Xi\u2019s voice and shouted out loudly. At this moment, they were clad in rags with haggard expressions. Their bodies were covered in innumerable scars and tied by a thick and long chain that was circulating a violet light. Their appearances were incomparably wretched.When Chen Xi arrived before the stone room and saw their appearances, he couldn\u2019t help but be shocked in his heart.Amongst these two people, one was a personal disciple of Starnet Palace, and his ancestor was even a great Nether Transformation Realm cultivator that was highly reputable in the southern territory, thus possessing both a respected status and formidable background; the other was a handsome and refined disciple of one of the three great institutions of Dragon Lake City, the Myriadcloud Institution, and was similarly an outstanding figure in the younger generation. Presently, the two of them had been reduced to this completely dark prison and had wretched appearances like beggars. How could it not cause shock?However, surprise is surprise, but the killing intent in Chen Xi\u2019s heart only increased. He\u2019d grasped this opportunity to be merciless to them when they were down with great difficulty. He would absolutely not miss this chance.Swish!Chen Xi held the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand and opened up the steel pillar like cutting through tofu before walking in.\u201cWhat do you want to do!? Chen Xi, we\u2019re Fellow Daoists, can\u2019t we just talk it out?\u201d Yu Haobai\u2019s face abruptly went pale and he shouted out successively.\u201cHmph! You can\u2019t kill me, you\u2019re just trash from an impoverished family. If you kill me, then not only will you die, all the people related to you will die as well. Of course, if you save us now, not only will I let bygones be bygones, I\u2019ll still grant you great rewards. How about it?\u201d Even until this moment, Chai Letian still maintained his superior bearing and his voice revealed dense disdain and confidence.Chen Xi was stunned and the gaze he shot at Chai Letian carried a trace of surprise. He was truly unable to imagine how this fellow actually still had this arrogant and bossy behavior even at a time like this. Was it stupidity? Or was he playing the fool?\u201cChen Xi, Fellow Daoist Chai is right, think it over a bit longer. Fellow Daoist Chai\u2019s ancestor is a great Nether Transformation Realm cultivator, and I\u2019m from the Myriadcloud Institution. Why bother offending us?\u201d Yu Haobai thought Chen Xi was afraid when he saw Chen Xi keeping silent. His attitude became strong and his voice already carried a trace of an indescribable feeling of superiority.Chen Xi did indeed keep silent, moreover, he still didn\u2019t intend to speak. He only swung the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand, cleanly chopping off Chai Letian\u2019s hand. The instant Chai Letian\u2019s agonized cries had sounded out, Chen Xi had already forcefully stuffed the severed hand into Chai Letian\u2019s mouth, and the cry of agony became a muffled groan. Blood flowed out from his mouth and blotted out his chest. He was in pain to the point he lay on the floor and started to shiver, and his appearance was extremely gruesome.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201d Yu Haobai\u2019s head was muddled from Chen Xi\u2019s sudden attack, especially when he saw Chai Letian\u2019s terrifying appearance of holding his own hand in his mouth, and Yu Haobai couldn\u2019t help but want to cry out loudly, yet he was afraid that Chen Xi would chop off his hand and shove it in his mouth as well.\u201cI ask, you answer. Otherwise, I\u2019ll ask Chai Letian after I kill you,\u201d Chen Xi said coldly.Yu Haobai nodded like a chick pecking on grains. He\u2019d completely understood Chen Xi\u2019s ruthlessness and viciousness, and the lack of hesitation when Chen Xi made a move caused him to feel dread from the depths of his heart.\u201cWhere are Du Qingxi and the others?\u201d Chen Xi asked. He\u2019d originally thought that Du Qingxi and the others might be here, but after he used his Perception Force to search for a short moment, he\u2019d noticed that there was no other people besides Chai Letian and Yu Haobai here.\u201cThey seem to have been captured by the Roc King. Supposedly, he wants to use them to refine some medicinal pill.\u201d Yu Haobai replied, and he trembled in his heart when he noticed Chen Xi\u2019s displeased expression, and he hurriedly continued. \u201cThis is true, but they ought to still be alive because refining that medicinal pill seems to require gathering a certain number of Violet Palace Realm cultivators. They\u2019ve only captured eight people and it seems they\u2019re still lacking quite a lot.\u201d\u201cThat being the case, why are the two of you locked up here?\u201d Chen Xi asked in detail, as Yu Haobai\u2019s answers were extremely vague and he could only believe half of it.\u201cThe Thunderhawk King intended to use our souls and blood to refine his mountain Magic Treasure, so he locked us up here to be tortured daily. His objective is to force out our monstrous resentment, so that it is able to improve the might of his Magic Treasure.\u201d Yu Haobai seemed to have recalled an unbearable memory, and his expression was savage as he gnashed his teeth and replied.\u201cWhat about Su Jiao\u2019s group?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about this. But there seems to be some people from Su Jiao\u2019s group amongst the eight people the Roc King captured.\u201d\u201cRight, how did all of you get captured by the demon kings? According to my knowledge, all of you have Violet Palace Realm cultivations, and if you joined forces, it would be sufficient to annihilate any demon king.\u201d\u201cWe were separated. After inexplicably coming out of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, I appeared within this depths of the mountain range, then I was captured here by the Thunderhawk King and encountered Fellow Daoist Chai.\u201dChen Xi fell into deep thought.\u201cI\u2019ve told you everything I know. Chen Xi, I beg you, please let me go?\u201d Yu Haobai suddenly knelt on the ground and said with an extremely pitiable expression, \u201cThere\u2019s no enmity between us. If you want to kill, then you ought to kill Chai Letian. It\u2019s he who tossed you down the chasm. I didn\u2019t offend you at all\u2026 AH!\u201dSwoosh!A wisp of sword light flashed by and Yu Haobai\u2019s head directly flew into the air. Even right before his death, he seemed to still be unable to believe that Chen Xi would actually dare do that\u2026\u201cWho knows how you will scheme against me in the future if I don\u2019t kill you?\u201d Chen Xi shook his head. Yu Haobai had repeatedly changed his attitude for the sake of living and had even pushed everything onto Chai Letian like a fence-sitter. A person like this was the most detestable, and the type of person that can\u2019t be allowed to live the most.\u201cPu! Cough! Cough! Cough!\u201d At the side, Chai Letian used all the strength in his entire body and had finally spat out the severed hand from his mouth. He glanced at Yu Haobai\u2019s headless corpse and his face was already completely dismal. He violently coughed and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t kill me. So long as you kill me, my Chai Clan ancestor will surely know it was you who\u2026\u201dSwoosh!Another cold light suddenly flashed by and all sounds came to an abrupt stop, and this gloomy and damp prison within the mountainside that was in darkness had once again fallen into a deathly silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 Pointing His Sword At Moonhowl RidgePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75 \u2013 Pointing His Sword At Moonhowl RidgeChen Xi rested for a short while after killing Chai Letian and Yu Haobai, then he returned to Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.Chen Xi pondered all along the way and arrived back at Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain before long.Within the abode, when Mu Kui saw Chen Xi return, he was overjoyed and said with a trembling voice, \u201cSenior, you\u2019ve finally returned. This lowly one was worried for so long.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019re you worried about? The Thunderhawk King has already been killed by me and it ought to be temporarily peaceful for a while.\u201d Chen Xi sat cross-legged on the meditation cushion and said, \u201cI want to recover my strength, keep watch for me.\u201d\u201cSenior, cultivate at ease, this lowly one will leave now.\u201dHiss!Mu Kui hastily left the abode, then he was unable to restrain the shock in his heart any longer and gasped.\u2026Chen Xi sat cross-legged on the meditation cushion and silently thought deeply about the two battles of today, and traces of comprehension surged into his mind.Live combat was the sharpest whetstone for tempering the cultivation of a cultivator.The more dangerous the situation, the higher one\u2019s potential would be able to rise. Every expert had to experience countless life and death experiences, going through desperate battles where one must put their life on the line to eventually win the battle. Only then would one be able to grow swiftly.At the same time that successively killing of the Black Ape King and Thunderhawk King allowed Chen Xi to clearly recognize his own strength, he also noticed his own inadequacy, and that was that his cultivation at the 1st star of the Violet Palace Realm was too low. Once he encountered those cultivators with comparable cultivations in the Martial Dao to him, he would only be able to flee. Moreover, if he wanted to remedy this flaw, then besides diligently and bitterly cultivating his qi refinement, mastering some formidable offensive methods was also another way.Chen Xi pondered for a long time, then shook his head and abandoned all the distracting thoughts in his mind before starting to cultivate.Swish! Swish!The spirit liquids within the octagonal containment bottle poured out.Within the boundless empty space of his violet palace.Along with Chen Xi executing the Ice Crane Technique, streams of liquid True Essence that were crystal clear like ice gurgled as they poured into the violet palace\u2019s lake. Above the lake, the originally dim True Essence star gradually become brighter as well. It was crystal clear and translucent, emitting a faint cold light, and its every movement corresponded with the faraway lake.After advancing to the Violet Palace Stage, every increase in level would condense a True Essence star within the violet palace. These True Essence stars corresponded to the True Essence lake and the brightness of the True Essence star made clear how pure and condensed the True Essence was. After nine stars were condensed, they would form a peculiar scene of nine stars strung together above the violet palace\u2019s lake, like an arched bridge built atop the lake. At that time, one could make preparations for charging into the Golden Hall Realm.Moreover, the strength of a Violet Palace Realm cultivator actually had a vitally important relationship with the cultivation technique.A top-notch qi cultivation technique was able to greatly expand the violet palace\u2019s lake. The larger and deeper the violet palace\u2019s lake, the thicker the True Essence would be, and the might displayed by the True Essence would be more terrifying.The True Essence refined by a superficial qi cultivation technique wasn\u2019t pure and condensed. Moreover, it produced very little effect to the expansion of the violet palace\u2019s lake, and the might displayed by the True Essence belonged to an ordinary level. Most importantly, when the True Essence cultivated like this advanced to a higher realm, the advancement would become filled with difficulties and it would be extremely difficult to break through to the next realm.However, cultivating a top-notch qi technique consumed spirit liquids at an extreme level. After all, the larger and deeper the violet palace\u2019s lake was, the brighter and more condensed the True Essence star would be, and the True Essence required to be refined would be even more.The Ice Crane Technique Chen Xi cultivated was a qi cultivation technique that Ji Yu had picked for him. Although it only contained the technique for the nine levels of the Violet Palace Realm, it was a top-notch qi cultivation technique. No matter if it was the quality or quantity of his True Essence, they both surpassed ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivators.One day later.Chen Xi awoke from his cultivation as the remaining 1,000kg of spirit liquid within the octagonal containment bottle had been completely refined by him. Presently, the True Essence star within the space in his violet palace was already extremely bright and dazzling, seeming to be carved from ice and jade, and it emitted a dazzling shine like an ice crystal.He\u2019d cultivated for a day and had exhausted 1,000kg of spirit liquid, whereas his cultivation had only advanced a bit, and this caused Chen Xi to be unable to refrain from sighing with emotion. In the road of cultivating, wealth, companions, techniques, and location were only four words, yet they were an irrefutable truth from ancient times.\u201cMu Kui.\u201d Chen Xi walked out of the abode.\u201cWhat is it, Senior?\u201d Mu Kui, who was cultivating under a pine tree, hurriedly got up and asked respectfully.Chen Xi thought for some time before saying, \u201cI want to make a trip to Moonhowl Ridge. Leave at once if I don\u2019t return within three days. Be sure to not stay behind.\u201dMu Kui was shocked in his heart and said in astonishment. \u201cSenior wants to go kill the Roc King?\u201dChen Xi shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m just saving a few people.\u201d After he finished speaking, he leaped up to the cloudy peak of the mountain.\u201cSenior, hold on. These are the treasures the Black Ape King left behind, please take them.\u201d Mu Kui seemed to have recalled something and took out a storage pouch before crying out hurriedly.\u201cI\u2019ll leave it for you. If my trip is successful, then I\u2019ll be leaving the depths of the mountain range. Keep those treasures to protect yourself.\u201d The voice was distant and faint, and Chen Xi\u2019s figure had already vanished into the horizon.Mu Kui was in a trance as he muttered to himself. He was extremely reluctant to let Chen Xi go. During these days of engaging with Chen Xi, he\u2019d already felt heartfelt admiration towards Chen Xi and had taken Chen Xi to be the Master he would serve his entire life.Mu Kui gazed at the spot Chen Xi vanished as he fiercely clenched his fist, and his eyes were filled with unswerving firmness.\u2026Dusk.Under the afterglow of the setting sun, the Moonhowl Ridge that was a towering mountain range that seemed like an ancient fierce beast had settled there was smeared with a dense color of blood, and it seemed even more desolate, bloody and magnificent.Swoosh!Chen Xi flew down and descended to the ground 5km away from Moonhowl Ridge. When he raised his eyes to look towards Moonhowl Ridge, he saw billowing demonic qi like a ramrod straight smoke signal as it pierced directly through the sky, blotting out the sky and revealing boundless gloominess and killing intent.At the center of Moonhowl Ridge were three extremely thick demonic qi\u2019s that were the most eye catching, and they were condensed completely and stood firmly. Compared to the nearby demonic qi that was faint like smoke, it was like the difference between a tiny pearl and the bright moon.Chen Xi pondered for a while. In the end, he decided to silently sneak over, then wait for an opportunity to make a move.He couldn\u2019t watch idly by as Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three met with misfortune. Otherwise, the trace of guilt within his heart would be unable to be made up for, and it would surely transform into an inner demon that corroded his Dao Heart and disturbed his cultivation.Ji Yu floated as he appeared, and he asked seriously. \u201cYou really want to go save them?\u201dChen Xi was startled, seeming to have never expected that Ji Yu would appear at this time, but he still nodded extremely firmly.\u201cWhy?\u201d Ji Yu continued to ask. \u201cDo you know that they once watched without lending a hand the moment you met with misfortune? At most, the relationship between all of you is only of ordinary friends.\u201d\u201cWhen I was in the sword immortal\u2019s abode, I caused them to fall into the chaotic battle that I caused for the sake of killing Chai Letian. This matter caused me to feel slightly guilty and I want to make reparations,\u201d Chen Xi said slowly.\u201cWhat if you die?\u201d Ji Yu continued asking.Chen Xi seemed to have never thought of this problem and he was stunned for a moment before saying after pondering for a short while, \u201cI think that no matter if it is the Heaven Dao or humanity, both of them point straight towards the heart. If the heart is not at peace, then I would probably leave behind a seed of inner demons. So, even if I die, I\u2019d still do this. Senior, didn\u2019t you say before that the path of cultivation is to comprehend the Heaven\u2019s Dao and staying true to your heart?\u201dA wisp of admiration that was extremely difficult to notice surged out from Ji Yu\u2019s experienced eyes when he heard this.After all, he was able to be calm in the face of danger. He was still able to stay true to his heart and charge forward boldly when facing a fatal disaster. This level of cultivation of the mind was extremely difficult to come by. Ji Yu had seen too many outstanding people in these one million years, like Rebirth Realm experts of the School of Fiendgod Body Refinement, peerless sword immortals\u2026 Which of them didn\u2019t possess superb natural talent and physique? But if it was in terms of the firmness and tenaciousness of the mind, then only very few of them could compare to Chen Xi.After all, if the Dao Heart wasn\u2019t firm and tenacious, then regardless of how high one\u2019s natural talent was, one would be unable to tread to the end of the Grand Dao!\u201cWith such mentality, the Grand Dao can be accomplished.\u201d Ji Yu left these few words before vanishing.Chen Xi muttered to himself, then his figure flashed like a strand of wispy smoke as he silently approached Moonhowl Ridge that was 5km away.After a short moment.Relying on the incomparably profound Divine Windwing Flight, Chen Xi safely avoided the demons that were on patrol at the foot of the hill and swiftly dashed along a secluded little path towards Moonhowl Ridge. The instant he arrived at the mountainside, the surrounding scene instantly changed greatly, like daytime had suddenly changed to the night, and his surroundings were suffused with demonic mist, causing him to only vaguely be able to distinguish the terrain.Wu! Wu! Wu!A wave of sharp sounds of wind that were like shrieks and howls resounded out, and the sounds actually contained a strand of a strange energy that threw one\u2019s mind into disorder.Chen Xi\u2019s Perception Force had attained an extremely high level since long ago, so he was naturally unafraid of the disturbance from the sound. As he scanned his surroundings, he instantly understood his current circumstances and his heart couldn\u2019t help but sink.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tzzt!A wisp of indescribable radiance surged out from the skinny and wrinkled covered face of the old man as he stared at the damaged copper coin on the ground. On the top of his head, various mysterious scenes vaguely appeared like strands and threads of lightning arcs, condensing into a red-crowned crane, a wyrm, a dashing horse and various other intelligent things; divine lights that were mysterious and profound revolved around it.\u201cOld Turtle, I\u2019ve just obtained news that the Black Ape and Thunderhawk have been killed!\u201d Suddenly, a low and feminine voice entered the cave, then a handsome man with long hair that wrapped around his shoulders and peach shaped eyes appeared swiftly.\u201cNo wonder\u2026 No wonder!\u201d The old man was stunned, his eyes still staring fixedly at the damaged copper coin on the ground. His expression revealed a wisp of enlightenment.\u201cYou already know?\u201d The man asked in astonishment.\u201cQing Qiu, extremely great fortune has arrived. If you trust me, then quickly follow me to a place.\u201d The old man suddenly stood up and held a pitch-black walking stick in his hand as he walked out with a swift pace.\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d The eyes of the middle aged man called Qing Qiu slightly narrowed. During these past few years, this was the first time he\u2019d seen the old turtle be so excited. A wave of surprise couldn\u2019t help but arise in his heart.\u201cMoon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.\u201d The old man\u2019s voice drifted over with the wind as he\u2019d already vanished.Qing Qiu\u2019s figure flashed as he pondered, and he was like lightning as he vanished with a \u2018swish.\u2019\u2026Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.Different from its previous desolate nature, the Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain today was completely bustling. The demons within the nearby 500km had gathered here in unison and had brought over good wine, spirit fruits, rare treasures and delicacies. They sat on the ground at the mountainside azure pine forest as they chatted with each other in comfort.\u201cI heard Senior Chen Xi killed the Aqua Cavern\u2019s Black Ape King and the Copper Mountain\u2019s Thunderhawk King within a day, this level of strength is truly shocking.\u201d\u201cIt is indeed. Senior Chen Xi is the most formidable Violet Palace Realm cultivator I\u2019ve seen. He\u2019d only advanced to the Violet Palace Realm less than half a year ago, yet his strength was already able to attain such a level. He\u2019s simply a heaven-defying genius!\u201d\u201cHaha! I saw the battle of Senior Chen Xi with the Black Ape King with my own two eyes that day, that profound and unpredictable sword technique, and unparalleled speed\u2026 Tsk tsk, there\u2019s no way to describe it, no way to describe it!\u201dMu Kui listened to the surrounding demons\u2019 discussions of Chen Xi. He listened to the undisguised admiration and flattery in their words, yet he was extremely calm in his heart.He knew what these fellows came here for. Once the Black Ape King died, the surrounding 5,000 km of territory was without an owner. These fellows had obviously already taken Senior Chen Xi to be the \u2018king\u2019 of this territory, and this was the reason why they\u2019d all ascended the mountain to express their friendliness.When he thought of this, a thought of doing an evil suddenly arose within Mu Kui\u2019s heart and it slipped from his mouth. \u201cAll of you won\u2019t be able to see Senior Chen Xi today, he\u2019s already headed to Moonhowl Ridge. He seems to want to battle the Roc King.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cThe Roc King?\u201d\u201cMy God! Does he want to die?\u201dThe sounds of talking, laughter, flattery\u2026 All sounds stopped abruptly before being replaced with numerous gasps, and the sounds revealed astonishment and disbelief.The atmosphere became depressing.\u201cThe Roc King is one of the very best experts amongst the seven great demon kings\u2026 Mmm, Brother Mu Kui, Brother has matters to attend to and will take my leave first.\u201d\u201cUh, I just remembered that my child is going to break through to the Congenital Realm today, I have to go stand guard for him.\u201dThe demons produced various reasons and had gloomy expressions as they hastily bid their farewells.Mu Kui didn\u2019t persuade them to stay and held the wine cup with both hands as he leisurely drank wine with a calm expression. He was already unable to give rise to an angry mood towards these fence sitters that came rushing when they heard wind of something favorable, and flee as soon as they hear wind of something unfavorable.Swoosh! Swoosh!It was at this moment that two flowing lights swiftly appeared in midair above Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain. One was an azure clothed silver haired old man and the other was a handsome middle aged man with long hair that draped his shoulders and eyes that were shaped like peaches.\u201cProfound-vision Old Turtle King!\u201d\u201cColdstar Mountain\u2019s Nine-tailed Fox King!\u201dThose demons that had walked to the base of the mountain raised their heads to glance over, they couldn\u2019t help but stop dead in their tracks, and their faces were already covered in an expression of astonishment. Amongst these two demon kings, one had indefinite whereabouts and unfathomable strength, the other lived in seclusion on Coldstar Mountain and supposedly possesses a strength on par with the Roc King.\u201cYou\u2019re that little wolf demon? Let me ask you, is the human youth on the mountain?\u201d The azure clothed silver haired old man\u2019s gaze swept out and had already descended onto Mu Kui because only he remained in the entire mountainside.At the foot of the mountain, all the demons were secretly rejoicing endlessly.Mu Kui naturally recognized these two extraordinarily powerful demon kings and he couldn\u2019t help but feel terror in his heart when he heard this.The Old Turtle King saw through Mu Kui\u2019s thoughts with a single glance and he said with a warm voice right away, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be worried, I didn\u2019t come to make trouble, but came for the sake of paying a visit to this human Fellow Daoist. I have something I need his help with.\u201dMu Kui couldn\u2019t help but be stunned when he heard this, the demons at the foot of the mountain and even the Nine-tailed Fox King by the Old Turtle King\u2019s side all felt a trace of astonishment.\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t believe what I said?\u201d The Old Turtle King shook his head and sighed.\u201cMy Master\u2026 He\u2019s gone to Moonhowl Ridge,\u201d Mu Kui stuttered as he said. The Old Turtle King\u2019s had an extremely good public reputation. At least within the depths of the southern barbaric mountains, he\u2019d never heard anyone say that the Old Turtle King changed his mind constantly, so Mu Kui was naturally able to believe the Old Turtle King.\u201cMoonhowl Ridge?\u201d The Old Turtle King was stunned.Mu Kui gritted his teeth and said, \u201cExactly. My Master\u2019s friends were captured by the Roc King, so my Master has already headed there to rescue them.\u201dThe Nine-tailed Fox King frowned as he said slowly, \u201cHmm? I heard the Roc and the others captured a few human cultivators these past few days. Presently, the Roc, Dark Wyrm, and Azure Python are in closed door cultivation in Moonhowl Ridge. They seem to desire to refine a cauldron of Bloodsoul Fortune Pills. Could it be that the human youth\u2019s friends are amongst them?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s truly courting death!\u201d The Old Turtle King\u2019s eyes surged with a wisp of unrestrainable rage when he heard this. \u201cQing Qiu, want to make a trip to Moonhowl Ridge with me?\u201dThe Nine-tailed Fox King rubbed his nose and sighed. \u201cOld man, you\u2019ve already asked, can I not go? Hmm, it\u2019s about time I decide upon a victor with the Roc.\u201d As he spoke, a wisp of arrogant confidence slipped past his peach shaped eyes.Swoosh! Swoosh!Flying lights tore through the sky, and the Profound-vision Old Turtle King and the Nine-tailed Fox King had vanished.\u201cFantastic! Only half a day has passed, I hope Senior Chen Xi can persist. With the assistance of these two demon kings, he will surely be safe and sound.\u201d Mu Kui stared blankly at the distant sky and only suddenly shouted out in pleasant surprise after a long time.At the foot of the mountains, the demons were all dumbstruck and were extremely regretful in their hearts.\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s actually a large-scale maze\u2026\u201dAt the mountainside of Moonhowl Ridge, Chen Xi gazed at the grey colored dense mist that roiled in his surroundings with a vigilant expression. He didn\u2019t dare make any rash movements, yet he was madly pondering on a method to break this formation in his mind.\u2026Within the center of the mountain, in a sealed off stone room that contained an area of around 3,300 meters, was a completely blood red large cauldron. A ghastly green flame was blazing beneath the large cauldron, whereas above the large cauldron, nine blood colored balls of light the violently fluctuated and streams of thick medicinal strength suffused out from them.At this moment, there were three men of various appearances sitting cross-legged on meditation cushions.A man in a wide black robe with a gloomy expression and eyes which contained a dim bloody frowned as he said, \u201cThese 996 types of precious spirit herbs and spirit woods are about to be completely refined by the blood refinement method, yet there\u2019s still a lack of one more human cultivator to make nine. If we\u2019re unable to capture one within three days, then this cauldron of medicinal pills would be completely wasted.\u201d\u201cBig Brother Roc is right, this is indeed a troublesome matter. I wonder what those two fellows, Black Ape and Thunderhawk, are doing? It\u2019s already been so long, could it be that they still haven\u2019t captured the human?\u201d A bold and wide-mouthed brawny man with a single horn on his forehead said with a deep voice, and his voice droned and revealed displeasure.\u201cHmm?\u201d Beside the single-horned brawny man was a white complexioned man with a pair of eyes that glowed with an evil light and no brows on his forehead. The man without brows seemed to have noticed something. He stretched out his hand and made a grabbing motion, and a Transmission Jade Slip was already in his hand.The face of the man without brows went grim when he finished looking at the content of the Transmission Jade Slip, then cried out. \u201cBig Brother Roc, Big Brother Dark Wyrm, the Black Ape King and Thunderhawk King have actually been killed!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d The black robed man, or in other words, the Roc King, seized the jade slip and briefly looked through it, then his expression became even gloomier and his voice was tinny as he said, \u201cThese two idiots! Never mind, since it\u2019s like this, we\u2019ll first refine a cauldron of medicinal pills.\u201dThe bald and single horned Dark Wyrm King pondered before saying, \u00a0\u201cExactly, with the two of them gone, it\u2019s sufficient to only refine only eight pills from this cauldron of Bloodsoul Fortune Pills.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s good like this as well. We\u2019ll go help the Black Ape and Thunderhawk take revenge after we finish refining the medicinal pills.\u201d The white complexioned Azure Python King that had no brows grinned as he nodded and agreed.\u201cLet\u2019s first completely refine these materials, then we\u2019ll go reap the blood and souls of those eight cultivators in a little while.\u201d The Roc King instructed.Instantly, the three demon kings divided themselves around the blood colored large cauldron and formed seals with their fingers, and numerous obscure and secret techniques were placed onto the cauldron.Right at this moment.\u201cMy King, a human youth has trespassed into the Thousand Illusion Maze Formation!\u201d An extremely respectful voice entered from outside the sealed off stone room.\u201cCould it be the little fellow called Chen Xi who killed the Black Ape and Thunderhawk?\u201d The Azure Python King said in alarm.\u201cDammit, he wasn\u2019t earlier or later, but just so happened to appear at the critical juncture of refining the materials.\u201d A wisp of helplessness surged out from the Roc King\u2019s shiny jade eyes.\u201cAzure Python, you help Big Brother stand on guard. I\u2019ll go deal with the human youth.\u201d \u00a0The Dark Wyrm King stood his extremely brawny body up, and his footsteps were like thunder as he walked out of the sealed off room while echoing out with bangs.\u201cDark Wyrm, you have to be careful. That kid is able to kill Black Ape and Thunderhawk, he\u2019s absolutely not easy to deal with.\u201d The Roc King instructed.\u201cHahaha! Don\u2019t worry Big Brother, I, Dark Wyrm, am not those two idiots. He actually dares trespass in Big Brother\u2019s territory, he\u2019s truly too rude.\u201d The Dark Wyrm King laughed loudly, the thick and strong bones with his entire body cracking. He\u2019d already stepped out of the sealed off room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 Dark Wyrm KingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77 \u2013 Dark Wyrm KingLayer upon layer of dense fog covered the sky, seeming like a pitch-black night.Chen Xi\u2019s Perception Force was merely able to cover an area of 33 meters, as surpassing 33 meters would cause his Perception Force to be bounced back by a shapeless force; this caused him to be even more cautious.If said in a simple manner, a formation was formed from numerous talismans that were engraved with dense talisman markings and cooperated with each other from a great distance. These types of formations were fused into one being with the world and possessed the might of techniques.In other words, there were only formations when there were talismans, and dense talisman markings that were filled with profound meanings were the core of the formation.Chen Xi had crafted talismans for many years and was deeply influenced by it, thus his comprehension ability was extremely high as well. But ordinarily, the talismans he crafted were all basic talismans, so he was at a loss for what to do when faced with the Thousand Illusion Maze Formation before him.However, although he was unable to easily get rid of the formation before him, he was still able to differentiate that the Magic Treasures used as the foundation of the formation ought to all be graded Magic Treasures, and only Violet Palace Realm cultivators were able to bind and control graded Magic Treasures!Chen Xi was extremely surprised. Although the grand formation before him was only a maze and illusion formation, who knew if killing intent was concealed within it? At the moment, the grand formation had obviously not been fully activated. Otherwise, he would absolutely not be without pressure as he was right now.Being pressed for time, Chen Xi controlled his formidable Perception Force like numerous tentacles to spread out in all directions. Fortunately, his foundation in the Dao of Talismans was extremely solid and his comprehension ability in the Dao of Talismans was shocking, otherwise, it would be utterly impossible for him to walk out of the Star Secret Realm. At this moment, when he calmed his heart and comprehended, he was like reeling in silk from cocoons. He was able to notice the location of many profundities, and he\u2019d obtained a good deal of comprehension towards the Dao of Formations.\u201cHmm?\u201d Chen Xi suddenly felt his heart palpitate.Right at this moment, a low and droning roar rumbled into the grand formation. \u201cChildren, go! Kill that human youth!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dAccompanying the waves of frenzied and bloodthirsty yelling, all of a sudden, the far away mist swiftly split open from the middle like a door had been opened. Demons like a wave of tidewater surged into the formation.Wolf demons that held dual Sai, bear demons that held iron rods, bat demons with wings on their backs\u2026 All of them had frenzied and savage expression as they roared and howled while charging towards Chen Xi.When he saw this, Chen Xi heaved a sigh of relief instead. The strongest amongst these demons was only at the Congenital Realm, but he still didn\u2019t dare be slightly careless due to the huge number of them.Although cultivators at the Violet Palace Realm were able to sweep through all Congenital Realm cultivators, when being surrounded by a powerful army and especially under the circumstances of being unable to fly into the sky, there was no Violet Palace Realm cultivator that dared guarantee they could completely annihilate a myriad of enemies by themselves. Attacks could come from anywhere, and sneak attacks and dirty tricks would endlessly occur.However, Chen Xi was already capable of crushing existences at the same cultivation as him when he was at the Congenital Realm. Presently, not only had he advanced to the Violet Palace Realm, his cultivation in the Martial Dao had attained the Dao Insight Stage; He wasn\u2019t afraid of tactics that used numbers to attain victory.Swoosh!Like a sea dragon entering the sea or a spirit crane returning to its nest; Chen Xi\u2019s figure was like a gust of wind as he attacked straight towards those demon beasts.Swish!Chen Xi\u2019s pierced into a blue-haired fish demon\u2019s scale armor with a single stab of his sword, piercing a hole through the fish demon\u2019s heart. Chen Xi\u2019s figure swayed to dodge a few demon-kind that had sneak attacked him before twisting his hand backwards and slashing out. The throats of another five demons were cut open, spouting pillars of blood.Swing!Die!Dodge!Swing again!\u2026Chen Xi charged into the crowd of demons, his body like a traceless gale as he swung the Seventhgold Swordbamboo that seemed like a scattering meteor that emitted a horrifying aura. His imposing manner became more and more sharp as he went on a rampage in the crowd of demons, cutting through their ranks with extreme ease.He didn\u2019t dare hesitate in the slightest, nor did he dare stay in the same spot for a second. He moved purely out of instinct, like an eel that had charged into a school of sardines. He threw the surroundings and the situation of the battle into chaos and relied on all the chaos to avoid being surrounded.But even then, there were still some sneak attacks that were like venomous snakes that waited for an opportunity at the side and had accurately hit Chen Xi. Fortunately, his body refinement cultivation was already at the Congenital Realm, so he didn\u2019t receive any injuries. Yet this also caused Chen Xi\u2019s nerves to become even more strained.The battle that tempered a person\u2019s will the most was undoubtedly a battle of life and death on the battlefield, where one faced a powerful army that was like a forest of sabers and swords without a shred of fear. When one man and one sword faced an army of demons in battle alone, it tested courage, wisdom and strength!Pu! Pu! Pu!Strands of dense blood shot out violently and sprayed midair, and the pungent smell of dense blood was almost unable to be dispersed and was extremely horrifying.Ah! Ah! Ah!Miserable howls that were like ghosts wailing rose and fell as one after another demon beast vanished under Chen Xi\u2019s sword. Every time a demon was stabbed to death by his sword, Chen Xi\u2019s killing intent would become even fiercer and sharper, like a treasured sword that was being tempered.He was like a god of death that endlessly reaped lives.Chen Xi didn\u2019t go insane from the stimulation of the blood, nor did he feel pity towards those demons that died beneath his sword. His consciousness was extremely cold and collected, like clear ice.\u201cHmm?\u201d Chen Xi seemed to have noticed something and suddenly twisted his head. A curved blade that was like a crescent had appeared within his pupils; it was like a god of ghosts had suddenly crawled out from hell and it emitted a terrifying dark and cold aura.At this moment, he just happened to fall into a siege from six greater demons, and he originally only required a single sword strike to break out of this predicament, however, along with the appearance of the curved blade, he was forced into a dilemma.Dodging the curved blade would mean suffering the attacks of the six greater demons, and doing it the other way would mean suffering the killing blow of the curved blade.Needless to say, the person that launched this sneak attack had an extremely precise grasp of the battle and had instantly dissolved the advantage Chen Xi had obtained from his desperate killing earlier and instantly forced him into a hopeless situation.A hopeless situation that seemed to already be a dead end that couldn\u2019t be broken out from.\u201cI\u2019ve finally caught this trace of an opportunity. This kid is indeed troublesome, but unfortunately, he\u2019s still going to die in the hands of me, Dark Wyrm.\u201d In the distance, the bald and single horned Dark Wyrm King that possessed a brawny figure couldn\u2019t refrain from laughing complacently, his eyes filled with an expression of ruthless savagery.But in the next moment, his smile froze as an unexpected turn of events occurred.Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!Eight cold and sharp flying swords suddenly appeared around Chen Xi\u2019s figure, seeming like a wisp of lightning that bore through the clouds. They instantly cut off the heads of the six surrounding greater demons.At practically the same time the flying swords appeared, the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in Chen Xi\u2019s hand waved out with a Wavesplit Hurricane that brought along unparalleled might as it fiercely slashed straight onto the curved blade.Clang!The collision of sword and blade emitted a sharp sound that was ear piercing and deafening, and Chen Xi borrowed the force of the collision to flash out like a shadow and floated off in retreat for a few hundreds of meters away.\u201cThis level of strength is not bad, all of you stand back. I\u2019ll greet this little human friend.\u201d A deep and tinny voice that was like muffled thunder sounded out from afar, and only now did Chen Xi notice a brawny man that was bald with a single horn as he held a dark blue curved blade and was walking right towards him.The dark blue curved blade was like a pond of lake water, both long and wide with cold lights revolving on the edge of the blade. The blade itself was two meters long and was virtually on par with a halberd, but the edge of this blade was much wider.Whoosh! Whoosh!The demons had been killed by Chen Xi to the point that those remaining were scared stiff long ago. When they heard him, they were all as if released from a burden and withdrew one after another, leaving the ground filled with corpses that flowed with blood.Only Chen Xi and the Dark Wyrm King remained on the battlefield.\u201cSeventhgold Swordbamboo? My Tenthwater Aurora Blade is a high-grade yellow-rank Magic Treasure, but it\u2019s actually unable to severe a section of Seventhgold Swordbamboo that hasn\u2019t been refined? It\u2019s truly a good treasure.\u201d The Dark Wyrm King\u2019s swept his gaze over Chen Xi, and his eyes emitted undisguised greed and burning desire when he clearly saw the appearance of the sword in Chen Xi\u2019s hand.Chen Xi was sizing up the Dark Wyrm King as well. The eight Netherezim Flying Swords fluttered about around him as he clenched the Seventhgold Swordbamboo tightly, and he was incredibly cautious in his heart. He\u2019d felt a shapeless pressure coming from the Dark Wyrm King, a pressure that was overbearing and ruthless. The strength of the Dark Wyrm King\u2019s aura seemed to even surpass the Thunderhawk King.\u201cOh! You are called Chen Xi? Let me think, I seem to have heard your name before\u2026\u201d The Dark Wyrm King seemed to have recalled something and thought for a moment before slapping himself on the head, and cried out. \u201cAmongst those human cultivators that I captured, there seemed to be a few fellows that discussed you. I originally intended to capture you, as the refinement of the Bloodsoul Fortune Pill still lacked a human cultivator, after all. But I never imagined that you would actually come over yourself. Hahaha!\u201dChen Xi was startled.\u201cDu Qingxi, Murong Wei, Cang Bin, Duanmu Ze\u2026 You ought to know these names, right?\u201d The Dark Wyrm King had a teasing expression as he spoke in an unhurried manner.Chen Xi remained silent, yet his expression became even icier. As expected, these demon kings really wanted to use them to refine medicinal pills and Yu Haobai hadn\u2019t deceived him.\u201cYou probably still don\u2019t know what a Bloodsoul Fortune Pill is, right? Hmm, it\u2019s actually extremely simple. It\u2019s to take the blood and souls of you human cultivators as the main medicinal ingredient, then combine it with some treasures of heaven and earth to refine a miraculous medicinal pill.\u201d The Dark Wyrm King licked his mouth and had a ghastly smile. \u201cWhereas you came at the perfect time, we just happened to be planning to extract the blood and souls of those people. Adding you would exactly fill the requirement of nine people and it couldn\u2019t be better.\u201dWhen he thought up to here, Chen Xi raised his eyes to look at the Dark Wyrm King and killing intent was already bursting out from his chest.The Dark Wyrm King noticed Chen Xi\u2019s expression and he couldn\u2019t help but be shocked in his heart.\u201cDie!\u201dIt was at this moment that Chen Xi utilized his Divine Windwing Flight and instantly vanished on the spot. In the next moment, a raging and violent gale descended to envelop an area of over a kilometer.The sound of wind howled and whistled, and the wind was sharp like the blade of a sword. For a time, the myriad of sword blades were like a torrential downpour, rumbling as they swept towards the Dark Wyrm King.Hiss! Hiss!The sky seemed as if it was torn open as this violent gale contained Dao insight and was executed by sword technique, so it transformed into peerlessly swift and fierce Sword Insight that was like lightning, sweeping away all obstacles with extremely shocking might.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d The Dark Wyrm King was dumbstruck for a moment, seeming to have never expected that Chen Xi would suddenly launch an attack without warning. His face sank as he took a large stride forward, then the Tenthwater Aurora Blade in his hand slashed out a myriad of solid blade lights in an instant. The blade lights seemed like numerous dark blue crescents that shot out violently with magnificent strength!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Bang!The swift and fierce sword lights that contained a trace of Wind Dao Insight crashed onto the myriad of dark blue blade lights that were like crescents, and the sound of rumbling explosions scattered in all directions. The peerlessly violent blasts of wind tore through the ground, splitting open numerous large ravines that were terrifying. The dense black mist in the surrounding 300 meters was swept clean, causing the field of vision to be clear.\u201cIt\u2019s actually Sword Insight! I never imagined that you were actually able to attain such a stage of cultivation in the Martial Dao at your young age, truly displeasing!\u201d The Dark Wyrm King successively stomped three paces back and glanced at Chen Xi in astonishment. Then the energy in his entire body skyrocketed as he said with a savage expression, \u201cUnfortunately, your cultivation is too weak, how could this level of strength injure me?\u201d\u201cTenthwater Aurora Slash!\u201d The Dark Wyrm King suddenly shouted out explosively, and the enormous dark blue curved blade in his hand transformed into a 30meter glowing blade light that swept towards the faraway Chen Xi.Chen Xi\u2019s eyes squinted as he executed his Divine Windwing Flight, then he successively leaped a few times to dodge the Dark Wyrm King\u2019s violent attack before moving about in the surroundings like a drifting light. The Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand was like a flashing gale as it pierced towards the Dark Wyrm King\u2019s weak points.He was only winding around the Dark Wyrm King, but not fighting!The True Essence of the Dark Wyrm King was too thick and his original form was a variant Wyrm. The True Essence he possessed was at least at the level of an 8th star Violet Palace Realm cultivator. Under these circumstances, going head-on with him was undoubtedly the most foolish approach.Ding! Ding! Ding!The Dark Wyrm King waved about the Tenthwater Aurora Blade, and the dark blue and wide blade blocked all of Chen Xi\u2019s attacks. His speed was unable to compare to Chen Xi, nor was his blade technique as swift as Chen Xi. But by relying on his own tremendous strength, he was able to easily deal with the attacks that swiftly shot at him from every angle, and his expression was extremely at ease.\u201cIt\u2019s of no use, my Wyrm family innately possesses extremely strong defense. Although your attacks contain Sword Insight, they\u2019re at most able to scratch an itch for me.\u201d The Dark Wyrm King roared with disdainful laughter. \u201cMoreover, what you\u2019re doing is extremely wasteful of True Essence. The longer it goes on, the more disadvantageous it is to you. Instead of bitterly struggling, why don\u2019t you simply let me chop off your head? Isn\u2019t that much better?\u201dChen Xi remained silent and sped up the attack speed of the Seventhgold Swordbamboo and sped up the shifting and movement of his movement technique. He was like a moth flying into a flame, steadfast and stubborn.\u201cTruly a hell-bent little fellow, hahaha.\u201d The Dark Wyrm King laughed even more arrogantly, as he seemed to firmly believe that Chen Xi already had no tricks left to play, and was just putting up a desperate fight.Swoosh! Swoosh!Chen Xi turned a deaf ear to the Dark Wyrm King; he was like a ghost when relying on his Divine Windwing Flight. He transformed into an arc that once again assaulted the Dark Wyrm King.The two of them had exchanged blows many times and had roughly understood their opponent\u2019s strength. Chen Xi\u2019s sword technique and movement technique were extremely fast, but his cultivation was completely suppressed by the Dark Wyrm King. For a time, the battle turned into a deadlock.\u201cIt\u2019s of no use, stop struggling, is there any meaning to\u2026 Ah! Big Brother, why have you come?\u201d The Dark Wyrm King was wildly roaring with laughter when a middle aged man in a wide black robe and eyes that were like jade colored torches suddenly appeared within his field of vision. Shockingly, it was the Roc King, Zhen Feng.However, what was strange to the Dark Wyrm King was that the Roc King\u2019s expression was indifferent, seeming to have not noticed him as he didn\u2019t say a word.Swoosh!A wisp of cold sword light suddenly appeared in his pupils, growing larger and larger, and the dense killing intent gathered on the sword light thoroughly jolted the Dark Wyrm King awake.In a life and death battle, slightly zoning out could cause the outcome of the battle to be decided. When the Dark Wyrm King realized the danger, the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in Chen Xi\u2019s hand was as swift as a clap of thunder as it flashed to attack the Dark Wyrm King.Kacha!The crisp sound of bones breaking echoed out, and an arm that carried blood that scattered in the air fell over 30 meters away.When Chen Xi saw this, he instead said to himself.Earlier, he\u2019d intentionally only wound around the Dark Wyrm King but not fight as he was showing weakness to his enemy, precisely for the sake of making the Dark Wyrm King let down his guard, then Chen Xi would only need to use his soul attack technique, Godly Illusion Arts, to break open up a trace of a flaw in the Dark Wyrm King\u2019s mind before being able to seize this opportunity to kill the Dark Wyrm King.However, Chen Xi never expected that the Dark Wyrm King would react so quickly, as the Godly Illusion Arts had only been executed when Dark Wyrm King had noticed it, causing his killing sword strike to only severe an arm of the Dark Wyrm King.But even then, it was sufficient to cause the Dark Wyrm King\u2019s strength to be weakened by almost half. After all, the Dark Wyrm King wasn\u2019t a School of Fiendgod Body Refinement cultivator and was unable to regrow his limbs. Once he lost his severed arm, then unless he found some supreme medicine capable of re-growing limbs and resurrecting the dead, otherwise, there would be no possibility of him growing another arm in his lifetime.\u201cSoul attack technique! I never imagined that you\u2019ve mastered so many techniques at such a young age!\u201d The Dark Wyrm King stopped the bleeding of his severed arm with a swing of his hand, and his ghastly pale face revealed resentment and viciousness. \u201cI\u2019ll temporarily let you go today\u2026\u201d As he spoke, he\u2019d grabbed the severed arm on the ground, then turned around and dashed towards the grey mist in the distance.Soul attack techniques were mysterious and possessed formidable might, moreover, they were extremely rare and valuable. They were something that only great sects and great clans with ancient hidden resources and reserves were able to possess.The loss of an arm had weakened the Dark Wyrm King\u2019s strength by almost half, and at this moment, he was worried that he would encounter Chen Xi\u2019s soul attack again, so he could only choose to flee.\u201cWant to flee? Leave your life behind!\u201d When he saw the Dark Wyrm King about to flee from his field of vision, Chen Xi commanded in his head and the Colossal Copper Mountain that was already floating above his palm continuously revolved as it flew into midair.Om!A wisp of violet glow instantly enveloped an area of 300 meters. The Dark Wyrm King was within this area and his dashing figure became sluggish, as his speed had obviously reduced greatly.Gravitational Space!The most miraculous thing about the Colossal Copper Mountain was its ability to form a gravitational field with its own Violet Mist Baleful Qi\u2019s gravitational force. Being under the shroud of the Violet Mist Baleful Qi\u2019s gravitational force was like carrying a heavy mountain or falling deep into a swamp, so it would be strange if someone\u2019s speed could be fast within it.\u201cColossal Copper Mountain!\u201d The Dark Wyrm King exclaimed involuntarily in surprise. \u201cDammit, how did this treasure fall into your hands?\u201dSwoosh!Chen Xi avoided making any reply. With a command in his heart, a Netherezim Flying Sword shot out violently like a wisp of lightning flashing through the sky. It instantly arrived before the Dark Wyrm King and a cold light flashed. Before the Dark Wyrm King could even let out a miserable cry of death, his head was already cleanly chopped off and blood sprayed out from his neck as his corpse crashed onto the ground.Chen Xi put away the Colossal Copper Mountain, then looked at the Dark Wyrm King who\u2019d become a pile of mush, and he endlessly exclaimed with admiration to himself.Chen Xi didn\u2019t continue sighing with emotion and he started gathering his spoils right away. A high-grade yellow-rank Tenthwater Aurora Blade and a horn that was like white jade and suffused with a gentle sheen. The Dark Wyrm King was originally a variant wyrm, so his horn was able to cure most poisons and was even a superb material for refining into a Magic Treasure; its value was extremely high.There was also another storage bracelet.Not only did the storage bracelet contain numerous spirit woods and ores, there were also three weapons which emitted oppressive spirit energy. What caused Chen Xi to be surprised was that he recognized all three of these weapons!Duanmu Ze\u2019s Sevenstar Rainbow Sword, Du Qingxi\u2019s Unity Azurelotus Dagger, and Song Lin\u2019s Skynet Thousandhook Umbrella, and these three Magic Treasures were all of high-grade yellow-rank.Chen Xi pondered, then quickly put away all the things, his gaze unintentionally sweeping the surroundings. He noticed a command token within the pool of blood and mush. The command token seemed like iron but wasn\u2019t iron, seemed like jade but wasn\u2019t jade, and when held in the hand, it looked to be covered in cloud patterns and revolving mist, revealing a mysterious aura of talisman markings.Chen Xi was delighted in his heart, he was just having a headache about how to leave this Thousand Illusion Maze Formation, but he never expected that things would go so smoothly. With this control token in hand, Chen Xi was completely capable of moving freely within this formation.Chen Xi poured a strand of True Essence into the control token as he pondered, then he took a stride forward and he\u2019d already walked out of the formation. His surroundings were filled with towering green mountains that were overgrown with flowers and trees, and he\u2019d already returned to the mountainside of Moonhowl Ridge.\u201cShit! The human youth has come out!\u201d\u201cQuickly report to the King!\u201dA team of demons were patrolling in the distance. They just happened to see Chen Xi walk out of the formation and they couldn\u2019t help but be slightly stunned. Then they seemed to have thought of something, and their expression abruptly went pale as they roared loudly and fled as quickly as they could.Chen Xi leaped out to stick out his hand and grab ahold of a sneaky looking minor demon, then he clutched the demon's throat as he asked coldly. \u201cWhere are those human cultivators being kept? If you don\u2019t tell me then I\u2019ll kill you right now!\u201d\u201cIn\u2026 In\u2026 Within the center of the mountain.\u201d The minor demon was terrified to the point its expression went bleak and it trembled in fear, even stuttering when it spoke.Bang!Chen Xi casually knocked the fellow out then raised his eyes to gaze high up the mountain peak, then he executed the Divine Windwing Flight to vanish on the spot like fluttering smoke.\u2026Within the room in the center of the mountain, raging green flames were rising and gushing. Above the enormous cauldron, those nine balls of light refined from hundreds of types of treasures of heaven and earth had already concentrated into the size of an infant\u2019s fist, and it was crystal clear like a glass ball as it emitted a delicate fragrance that was enchanting.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Dark Wyrm returned yet? Never mind, the pill refinement is more important. Brother Azure Python, I\u2019ll leave the extracting of blood and souls to you.\u201d The Roc King who wore a broad black robe scolded with a high-pitched voice, then he instructed the Azure Python King who was by his side.\u201cBig Brother, wait for a moment, I\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201d The Azure Python King cupped his hands, then got up right away before walking off in a zig-zagged, yet incomparably swift pace, and he\u2019d vanished from the stone room in the blink of an eye.\u201cOh, I remember that there are two extremely beautiful female cultivators amongst those humans. Should I do a little something?\u201d The Azure Python King had his hands behind his back as he walked in the quiet and gloomy passageway within the center of the mountain, and a trace of a mysterious smile appeared on his fair and beardless face.After a short moment.The Azure Python King arrived at a ghastly and terrifying stone room within the center of the mountain, numerous thick and strong iron pillars covered the entire room. There were male and female cultivators bound on eight of these iron pillars.Their entire bodies were without injury nor pain, yet they had bleak expressions and dejected spirits, and their eyes were as lifeless as if they were soulless wooden puppets.If Chen Xi was here, he would be able to notice that Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin were shockingly among these eight people!\u201cFellow Human Daoists, we meet again.\u201d The Azure Python King held his hands behind his back as he walked in the stone room. He grinned as he glanced at the eight people bound to the iron pillars, particularly when he saw Du Qingxi. His eyes emitted undisguised lust that was greedy and cruel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 Prison BattlePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79 \u2013 Prison BattleThe eight people bound to the iron pillars raised their heads when the Azure Python King spoke, and all their grieved and dispirited faces emitted an expression of extreme hatred.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of hating? All of you don\u2019t even have the strength to tie up a chicken after your True Essence was sealed. If I\u2019m willing, I can take your lives with a swing of my hand.\u201d The Azure Python King grinned as he said this, then his gaze continuously stared closely at Du Qingxi. In his eyes, even though Du Qingxi\u2019s expression was haggard, her beautiful face that was like a picture was still so gloriously appealing. It caused him to feel greed and desire, and he couldn\u2019t help but move closer and stretch his hand to stroke Du Qingxi\u2019s face.\u201cI\u2019ll execute a Secret Art and commit suicide right away if you dare touch a finger of mine!\u201d Du Qingxi turned her head to the side to avoid his finger, and her clear eyes were filled with the flames of rage and hatred.The Azure Python King was stunned for a moment before smiling as he sighed. \u201cAll you humans are really strange, it\u2019s like all of you cultivate secret arts for committing suicide. Could it be that all of you prepared long ago to use it in a situation like this?\u201dAlthough he said this, the Azure Python King didn\u2019t dare arbitrarily act rashly. After all, the refinement of the Bloodsoul Fortune Pills required blood and souls that were full of vitality. If Du Qingxi died from suicide, he would feel extremely pained from the loss as well.\u201cWhy bother struggling? If you obey me, then I guarantee I will properly satisfy you. I\u2019ll make you experience paradise and make you unable to stop wanting more, then you\u2019ll completely fall in love with this king.\u201d The Azure Python King\u2019s gaze brazenly scanned Du Qingxi\u2019s entire body. His gaze was promiscuous and his words were filled with dirty and filthy things. It caused Du Qingxi to be angered to the point her beautiful face went pale as she bit her lips tightly as her entire body ceaselessly trembled.\u201cDespicable! Azure Python King, come at me if there\u2019s anything! Aren\u2019t you ashamed for bullying a girl?\u201d The nearby Duanmu Ze roared in rage.\u201cIs it your place to interrupt when this King is speaking?\u201d The Azure Python King snorted coldly, then leaped over to stand right before Duanmu Ze as he stuck out his hand and heavily slapped Duanmu Ze\u2019s face. Five red and swollen finger marks instantly appeared on his handsome face.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Duanmu Ze seemed to be in a state of madness as he desperately struggled, wanting to rip open the binding of the iron pillar. Yet it was a futile effort.A slap was a method that was most embarrassing to another. A resounding and clear slap combined with a disdainful and arrogant attitude would be like sharp knife gouging the chest, stimulating the most furious and insane feelings within a person\u2019s heart.Since Duanmu Ze was born in the Duanmu Clan, he was a figure like a proud son of the heavens, handsome and elegant with graceful bearing. When had he ever suffered such a humiliation? Killing him was just a matter of will, but this slap\u2026 It was truly too hurtful!\u201cEnraged? Despairing?\u201d The Azure Python King was like an atrocious devil as he grinned. \u201cYou want to kill me? Unfortunately, you\u2019ll never be able to do it. Although there\u2019s a youth called Chen Xi who came to rescue all of you, he\u2019s now trapped within the Thousand Illusion Maze Formation. Oh, if I think about it now, he\u2019s probably already dead in the hands of Dark Wyrm.\u201d\u201cChen Xi!\u201d Duanmu Ze\u2019s figure trembled, then abruptly roared with all his strength. \u201cChen Xi, flee quickly! There are three demon kings here and you\u2019re absolutely not his match!\u201dBeside Duanmu Ze, Du Qingxi\u2019s body stiffened as she muttered, \u201cChen Xi? He\u2026 why is he here? Isn\u2019t he giving away his life? How silly\u2026\u201d Although she said this, a stream of dense warmth and emotion surged into her heart. So many days had passed since she\u2019d been captured in the prison within the center of this mountain, and she\u2019d despaired long ago. She only hoped that she could die a swift death and not suffer torture and humiliation. However, at this moment, how could she not be moved when she heard that Chen Xi was on the way to save her?\u201cDammit! Isn\u2019t this courting death? Scram! Quickly scram, I won\u2019t let you fucking save me, scram!!\u201d Song Lin raised his head and roared as he gnashed his teeth, yet his eyes were already getting moist.Even though they didn\u2019t suffer any harm to their bodies while being captured here, the constant cursing and humiliation they suffered from the various demons caused them to feel that this place was virtually like a hell that made death sound good! A den of monsters!\u201cHAHAHA! Looks like all of you didn\u2019t hear me clearly, Chen Xi is almost assuredly dead by now, what\u2019s the use of wasting any more of your strength to shout?\u201d The Azure Python King let out a deafening laugh, his laughter revealed inexplicable complacency and confidence. \u201cGive up, all of you will be awaiting his arrival forever, forever!\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019ve disappointed you.\u201d Suddenly, an icy cold and indifferent voice swiftly sounded out. At practically the exact instant that this voice appeared, a wisp of a chilly sword light that seemed like a spark of lightning tore through the air as it swept towards the Azure Python King\u2019s neck.The sword light was like a shuttle as cold lights appeared on it, the Sword Insight that was like ice was pure and condensed, as if it could shatter and pierce through anything. The instant it appeared, that swift, fierce, and dazzling sword light had already lit up the entire prison, dazzling to the point one was unable to open one\u2019s eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d The Azure Python King\u2019s reaction was extremely quick as well. With only an intention, a large hammer that was coiled in azure lights appeared within his hand and fiercely smashed towards the sword light that shot straight towards him.This large hammer was called Cobalt Glaze and it was an intermediate-grade yellow-rank Magic Treasure refined from cobalt steel, then placed by the Azure Python King into his body to be cultured for a thousand years. It possessed sufficient spirit, and with a wave of the hammer, violent strong azure air blasts burst out, the strong winds whistling with an extremely astonishing force.However, that sword light seemed as if it possessed intelligence, it changed its direction to move along the side of the Cobalt Glaze hammer before swiftly attacking once again, forcing the Azure Python King to retreat in a sorry state and lose the initiative.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!Another few more sword images emerged and the sword lights that were like flashing gales contained the sound of wind and thunder as cold lights that seemed like ice were faintly emitted from them.The speed of the Windflow Divination Sword\u2019s gale, the violence of the Seventhgold Swordbamboo\u2019s violent thunder, and the coldness of the Ice Crane Technique\u2019s ice were combined together with Sword Insight that surged like a rainbow in the clear sky, causing an extremely ghastly scene.The person capable of executing this level of sword technique was naturally Chen Xi, without a doubt.He\u2019d already silently snuck in when the Azure Python King entered the prison, then he executed his Traceless Aura Technique to conceal himself nearby. He\u2019d clearly heard everything that happened within the prison, especially when he heard Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three roaring with all their might when they knew of his arrival. It caused his heart to feel at ease for no reason, as if he\u2019d removed a burden from his heart. His Dao Heart became illuminated and his thoughts cleared. At the same time, it made his resolution to save them become firmer.However, because the prison room was narrow and cramped, it would be extremely easy to injure Du Qingxi and the other if he were to battle the Azure Python King in the prison room. So, Chen Xi had already exerted his full strength the instant he decided to launch an attack, and he would attack aggressively, step by step, so that he would be able to kill the Azure Python King in a short amount of time.Clang! Clang! Clang!The sword light was like lightning and the terrifying energy condensed on the tip of the sword forced the Azure Python King to repeatedly dodge backward in an extremely sorry state. Bright lights shook intensely on the Cobalt Glazed hammer in his hand as numerous terrifying sword marks were left on its surface.Chen Xi pressed on. The Windflow Divination Sword was executed by him to the limit and he\u2019d already forgotten how many sword moves he made as he stabbed, pierced, slashed, chopped, flicked, and swept. Every sword strike contained a strand of Wind Dao insight and was extremely swift like lightning. The originally cramped and narrow prison was filled with a myriad of Sword Insight that was like lightning and wind, and the peerlessly fierce and swift might of the sword seemed to almost crush space itself.\u201cChen Xi!\u201d\u201cHe actually killed his way in\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen did this fellow become so formidable?\u201dAt that moment, the eight people within the prison had all recognized Chen Xi. Their expressions that were dejected and dispirited suddenly became agitated and their eyes carried a trace of blazing hope.\u201cDao Insight Stage! Ice attribute True Essence! Violet Palace Realm cultivation!\u201d Three successive exclaims of surprise sounded out abruptly. If Chen Xi turned around, he would surely notice that the one who emitted those exclaims of surprise was Cang Bin, the leading figure of the Cang Clan\u2019s younger generation that had always been following by Su Jiao\u2019s side.After he let out the surprised exclamations, Cang Bin seemed to have become conscious of how improper it was and he swiftly shut his mouth with a flickering expression.The relationship between him and Chen Xi was absolutely far from being good. If it wasn\u2019t for Su Jiao, he wouldn\u2019t even remember who Chen Xi was. Even until just now, he\u2019d only taken Chen Xi to be a laughable and pitiable ant, and he felt it was absurd when the Azure Python King said Chen Xi had trespassed into Moonhowl Ridge with a desire to rescue them. Would a disciple from an impoverished family that only knew talisman crafting and the culinary arts be able to survive under the attacks of a myriad of demons? Would he be able to withstand the attacks of the three demon kings?However, at this moment, as he looked at Chen Xi relying on a sword to force the Azure Python King to repeatedly retreat without any room for striking back, only now did Cang Bin suddenly realize that the fellow that he\u2019d always taken to be an ant had now thrown him far, far behind\u2026This strong contrast even caused him to be unwilling to believe that this was a fact, and he even wished for nothing more than for Chen Xi to be defeated at the hands of the Azure Python King now!This was Cang Bin\u2019s mentality, forever unwilling to see an ant that was countless times weaker than him suddenly become an enormous colossus that he had to look up to.Jealousy? A warped heart? Unwillingness? It was too complicated!No one noticed the unnaturalness of Cang Bin\u2019s expression. Their attention was drawn by his three successive shocked exclamations from before. When they looked over carefully, they too noticed that Chen Xi\u2019s strength actually possessed an extremely astonishing change and that his cultivation in the Martial Dao was at the Dao Insight Stage caused them to be extremely shocked even more. Because, although they were the most distinguished amongst the younger generation of Dragon Lake City, not one of their cultivations in the Martial Dao had attained such an extent!\u201cCould it be that this fellow obtained a great fortuitous encounter? It\u2019s simply as if he\u2019s a different person!\u201d Duanmu Ze muttered; he was both shocked and glad.\u201cPerhaps, he was always hiding his strength when he entered the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain,\u201d Song Lin spoke as if he thought of something.\u201cNo matter what, by daring danger to come rescue us, Chen Xi has already taken us as friends, yet we\u2026\u201d Du Qingxi\u2019s expression dimmed after she spoke a sentence. \u201cYet we never considered his feelings. When we were within the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, Chai Letian attacked Chen Xi by surprise and caused him to fall into the chasm. We hesitated to act due to Chai Letian\u2019s background, we stood idly by and remained completely unmoved. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve already broken his heart, right?\u201dDu Qingxi\u2019s words caused Duanmu Ze and Song Lin to look dazed, then they lowered their heads in shame.Pzzat!A sound that was like tearing through rags sounded out, a long and narrow scar slashed down from the left shoulder of the Azure Python King, tearing through his clothes and flesh, and fresh blood flowed.Bang!Another loud noise echoed out, like the sound of an iron halberd shattering, and the Cobalt Glaze hammer in the hands of the Azure Python King shattered with a bang, transforming into fragments that scattered all over the ground.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m actually injured?\u201d The Azure Python King\u2019s body stuck close to the wall with an absent-minded expression, seeming to have become muddled from this successive turn of events.How could Chen Xi let such a superb opportunity go? The Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand emitted a sharp howl as it swiftly stabbed directly towards the Azure Python King\u2019s throat!It was at this moment that rumbling echoed out, and the wall collapsed with a loud crash. A skinny black robed person suddenly appeared, and he conveniently grabbed the Azure Python King before instantly retreating explosively over 30 meters away, with a speed so swift that it was actually a tiny bit faster than Chen Xi\u2019s sword technique!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 Battling The Roc KingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80 \u2013 Battling The Roc KingThe black clothed man had a skinny and pale countenance. His figure tall, with black violet hair that fluttered in the wind. His eyes were jade green and shiny like a blazing flame, and they seemed as if they possessed a magical charm that was capable of sucking a person\u2019s soul in.The moment this person appeared, demonic qi that covered the heavens and the earth madly surged into appearance, transforming into roiling black mist the coiled around his body. His imposing manner was extremely astonishing.\u201cRoc King!\u201d Du Qingxi exclaimed involuntarily, then swiftly said, \u201cChen Xi, you have to watch out. This fellow\u2019s cultivation in body refinement and qi refinement have both attained the perfection-stage of the Violet Palace Realm. His strength isn\u2019t inferior to an ordinary Golden Hall Realm cultivator in the slightest!\u201dChen Xi was secretly shocked as he gazed at the black robe Roc King that was over 30 meters away.\u201cAzure Python, you return to the pill refinement room first to look after the cauldron, leave this to me.\u201d The Roc King stood proudly as he instructed indifferently.\u201cBig Brother, this fellow killed Dark Wyrm, you absolutely must not let him off!\u201d The Azure Python King hatefully glanced at Chen Xi before turning around and leaving.\u201cYou\u2019re really not bad. Possessing a cultivation at the initial-stage of the Violet Palace Realm, yet able to comprehend the Dao Insight Stage of cultivation in the Martial Dao. I presume you\u2019re a rather rare genius amongst you human cultivators.\u201d The Roc King\u2019s gaze stared faintly at Chen Xi. Seeming to have already seen through Chen Xi\u2019s limits, he said in a light voice, \u201cHowever, you\u2019re far from being a match for me. Although the comprehension abilities of demon-kind are far inferior to you humans, I\u2019ve already cultivated for over 10,000 years. Regardless of body refinement, qi refinement, or cultivation in the Martial Dao, they\u2019re all far deeper than yours, so I advise you to give up. No matter how you struggle, your end is only death!\u201dChen Xi was shocked in his heart once again. The roc family were originally extremely terrifying existences from the primordial era that were formidable. According to legend, adult rocs with a pure bloodline were an entire few thousands of kilometers in size, and when they spread their wings, it was even able to cover the entire sky. Swallowing seas and mountains with a single gulp, soaring into the sky with a single flap of their wings!Although the Roc King before Chen Xi wasn\u2019t so instilling of terror and despair like his ancestors, he was still an extremely formidable existence. He\u2019d cultivated for over 10,000 years! Even a stupid being would probably have already grown into an expert that dominated an area after experiencing these extremely long years.\u201cDon\u2019t listen to his nonsense. Although the natural talent of the roc family is extraordinary, his natural endowments are extremely deplorable, and only being able to cultivate to the perfection-stage of the Violet Palace Realm after 10,000 years is sufficient to prove this point. If it was during the primordial era, this fellow would at most be a baby that had just learned to walk within the roc family.\u201d Song Lin hurriedly spoke out.The Roc King didn\u2019t become furious and his expression was gloomy as always, without the slightest change as he said in a light voice. \u201cEverything you said is correct, but all this is meaningless, right?\u201dIt was indeed meaningless, and Chen Xi admitted this. Because a fact was right in front of his face, the Roc King was the one with the strongest cultivation and the most terrifying one present here; this was something that no one was able to deny.\u201cI spoke so much because I actually don\u2019t have the heart to kill you, as I feel sympathy for a talented person like you. I hope that you\u2019re able to become my subordinate, follow me to create a Grand Dao together and proudly roar out our names in the world!\u201d The Roc King said seriously, \u201cOf course, if you refuse, then I\u2019ll surely kill you today. After all, your comprehension ability is too shocking, and once you grow, you\u2019ll surely become a great calamity in the future. I couldn\u2019t eat and sleep in peace if I didn\u2019t kill you.\u201dDu Qingxi and the other were all stunned as they seemed to have never expected that the Roc King would look so highly upon Chen Xi.\u201cImpossible!\u201d Chen Xi didn\u2019t even think before resolutely refusing.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to consider it a little longer?\u201d The Roc King asked.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to consider it. Following you will undoubtedly be helping the wicked conduct wicked deeds and bring calamity to the world. Although I, Chen Xi, am not a sage that pities all humankind, I have my own Dao Heart on the path to the Dao. The path you\u2019ve given isn\u2019t suitable for me.\u201d Chen Xi spoke out word for word.At this moment, Chen Xi suddenly felt that the pressure the Roc King gave him had been weakened a great deal, as if his words had resonated with his soul, causing his Dao Heart to become even more firm and immovable. It became clear and illuminated.\u201cAlright! In the three thousand Grand Daos, everyone has their own path to tread. Unfortunately, you\u2019ll be losing your life on your path today.\u201d The Roc King sighed. \u201cFollow me if you\u2019re afraid of affecting your friends. Don\u2019t worry, since it\u2019s a battle, then I\u2019ll kill you openly. I\u2019ll let you know how you died, and will absolutely not attack you by surprise.\u201dAs soon as he finished speaking, the Roc King swung his black robe, and within the demonic mist that suffused the air, he\u2019d already flashed towards outside the center of the mountain. He actually didn\u2019t spare Chen Xi another glance, as he if he was entirely unafraid that Chen Xi wouldn\u2019t follow him.\u201cChen Xi, don\u2019t go. Quickly flee and don\u2019t care about us,\u201d Du Qingxi said hurriedly as soon as the Roc King left, her clear eyes were filled with worry and anxiousness, and she spoke with wholehearted sincerity.\u201cRight! Flee! Live to fight another day! We\u2019re dead, but you can\u2019t throw away your life because of this.\u201d\u201cDu Qingxi is right, you\u2019re far from being a match for the Roc King. You should flee quickly.\u201dDuanmu Ze and Song Li spoke out at practically the same instant, their expressions firm and serious.\u201cAll of you\u2026 How can all of you be like this? How would you know before trying? Once Chen Xi leaves, wouldn\u2019t all of us be refined into medicinal pills? All of you are willing, but I\u2019m unwilling!\u201d At the side, Murong Wei who\u2019d never spoken all this time cried out in a sharp voice. She was from the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Azurewood Institution and possessed an appearance that was delicate, attractive, and elegant; however at this moment, her expression flickered between an ashen and lived expression, and there was a trace of rage within her eyes.Chen Xi still remembered that Murong Wei, Yu Haobai, and the twins Du Quan, and Du Qui were all similar, they\u2019d only followed the lead of Chai Letian and obeyed everything he said. Although they never did make things difficult for him in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, when Chai Letian made things difficult for him, she\u2019d instead added fuel to the flame from the side, like a servant that only knew how to wag her tail to curry favor with Chai Letian.Now, the twins Du Quan and Du Qui had died in the sword immortal\u2019s abode, Chai Letian and Yu Haobai had died at his hands, and only Murong Wei remained.In the beginning, Chen Xi rather sympathized with her bitter experience, but when he heard her words now, there was instead a wave of uncomfortableness in his heart.\u201cMiss Murong Wei is correct. Chen Xi, the lives of everyone are grasped within your hands now. Don\u2019t let down the hopes of everyone.\u201d At the side, Cang Bin spoke shamelessly.\u201cDespicable! Motherfucker, all of you participated in trying to harm my Brother Chen, now all of you want to lead him to death as well? No way!\u201d Duanmu Ze was angered to the point he let loose a torrent of abuse.\u201cCang Bin, I remember that you and Su Jiao seemed to wish for nothing more than to kill Chen Xi, right? Don\u2019t you feel what you just said is shameless?\u201d Song Lin was extremely furious as well.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t bear it any longer when he saw Du Qingxi about to speak, and he spoke out in restraint. \u201cEnough. I came here this time for the sake of rescuing all of you. If worst comes to worst then it\u2019s only death. But if I don\u2019t fight until the end, then I\u2019ll absolutely not give up!\u201d The sound of his voice hadn\u2019t finished sounding out when Chen Xi\u2019s figure had already transformed into a gust of wind that floated away.\u2026In the sky above Moonhowl Ridge.Black clouds billowed as demonic qi swept throughout, the Roc King stood in the sky with his hands behind his back, as the demonic qi on his body violently danced about and whistled, causing his black robe to flutter, his imposing manner dashing to the skies!\u201cGreat King!\u201d\u201cThe King is going into battle?\u201dOn the ground, one the rocs\u2026 Within an area of 50km of Moonhowl Ridge, innumerable gazes had gathered towards here at this moment, and they all gazed at that towering figure in midair that was like a king that looked down upon the world.Swoosh!After a short moment, another flowing light flashed, and a tall and skinny youth appeared on the sky only 300m away from the Roc King.\u201cAh! It\u2019s actually that human youth!\u201d\u201cThis fellow was extremely formidable in the Thousand Illusion Maze Formation, an entire 100 plus brothers of ours died beneath his sword, he\u2019s truly detestable!\u201d\u201cI heard the Dark Wyrm King was killed by him as well. But now that our King is going into battle, this human youth will die for sure!\u201dA wave of whispered discussion arose amongst the nearby demons when they saw Chen Xi, and the gazes they shot at Chen Xi contained shock, disdain, pity, hatred, and so on and so forth.\u201cI\u2019ll give you one last chance. Do you want to pledge allegiance under my command?\u201d The Roc King\u2019s shiny jade green eyes were like two green bolts of lightning that swiftly descended onto Chen Xi. His voice was high pitched, yet carried an aura of decisive killing.\u201cIf you want to fight, then fight. There\u2019s no need to say anything further.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s expression was calm. He held the Seventhgold Swordbamboo tightly in his right hand, and the eight Netherezim Flying Swords were like swimming fish as they swam in patrol around his body, waiting for the arrival of the battle.This was an aboveboard battle, and all schemes and tricks would be shattered before absolute strength. What they were competing at was strength, courage, and cultivation in the Martial Dao.To Chen Xi, this battle was against the most terrifying opponent he\u2019d ever encountered since cultivating to date. At the same time that his nerves were strained, a strand of blazing battle intent surged out from his heart. His eyes were completely icy cold, yet the activity in his entire body was boiling as if he was aflame. His mind was completely alert and was filled with the burning hot battle intent that was like lava.His fighting spirit soared!\u201cGood! You indeed have the qualifications to fight this King, since you\u2019re able to emit such pure and valiant battle intent.\u201d The Roc King laughed into the air, his voice containing a trace of domineering and piercingly cold killing intent. It wasn\u2019t inferior to a thunderclap when it poured into the ears of the nearby demons, shocking them to the point their eardrums almost shattered.Taken by surprise, Chen Xi felt as if his heart was smashed by a sledgehammer, and the circulation of vital energy within his entire body was almost collapsed and thrown into disorder. He hurriedly circulated his True Essence and the True Essence that was icy cold like ice quickly dispersed any abnormalities.Not only did Chen Xi not feel afraid, the battle intent in his chest grew even stronger, and his gaze became even icier cold and pure as he took the initiative to launch an attack.Om!Lightning flickered throughout the Seventhgold Swordbamboo, and there were even traces of airflow that were like ice suffused atop its surface. With a glance, the one meter long Seventhgold Swordbamboo seemed to have transformed into an ice dragon that was filled with the energy of lightning.Swoosh!Chen Xi vanished from the spot to appear before the Roc King in the next moment. The Seventhgold Swordbamboo pierced out like lightning, causing the entire sky to seem as if a violent and raging gale had swept past, bringing along the terrifying force of crushing everything as it swept towards the Roc King.Chen Xi didn\u2019t hold back and exerted all his strength in this attack.\u201cToo weak!\u201d The Roc King\u2019s arms shook and a surging great river instantly appeared between his palms, the river water was pitch-black and roiling, like an ever-turning tide.Splash!Chen Xi\u2019s full force sword strike already contained Wind Dao Insight, yet it was like a clay oxen entering the sea, never to be seen again, as it was actually easily neutralized by this black river!Swoosh!Chen Xi flashed explosively in retreat when his attack missed, and he was extremely shocked in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 Tidal Dao InsightPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 81 \u2013 Tidal Dao InsightChen Xi stared fixedly at the black river that whistled and surged between the Roc King\u2019s hands. Although the river was only 70cm long, it gave a feeling that it was mighty and without end; it was extremely unbelievable.\u201cDie!\u201d Chen Xi refused to believe it and swung his sword out once again, Galeflash Shadow, Breezy Rain, Dark Squall, Tide Squall, Wavesplit Hurricane, and Space Shattering Typhoon, all six of the moves within the Windflow Divination Sword were executed to the limit by him, and he was confident that an attack like this was more than enough to kill even the Thunderhawk King head on.However, he still accomplished nothing!The black colored river was like a bottomless abyss that could dissolve anything, no matter how fierce and terrifying Chen Xi\u2019s Sword Insight was. So long as it was flushed by the river water, then all the energy within it would dissipate without a trace.Chen Xi\u2019s thoughts revolved and he didn\u2019t continue going forward.\u201cI\u2019ve said it before, you aren\u2019t a match for me.\u201d The Roc King was calm and composed as he laughed, then a wisp of arrogance gushed out from his skinny face. \u201cYou\u2019ve only comprehended a strand of Wind Dao Insight, whereas after experiencing 10,000 years of comprehending, I\u2019ve instead comprehended Tidal Dao Insight, a complete Tidal Dao Insight! How could you possibly be a match for me?\u201dChen Xi\u2019s eyes squinted as he had a clear understanding of what that meant.Every technique was divided into the basic-stage, advanced-stage and unity stage. Once this stage was attained, one could already fuse with the world, and every move was able to draw upon the energy of heaven and earth to be used as one\u2019s own.Above the unity-stage was the Dao Insight Stage.At this stage, one had to comprehend the world and the profundity of the Dao. So long as one\u2019s natural endowments weren\u2019t bad and possessed sufficient comprehension ability, then one could comprehend a Dao Insight of one\u2019s own from all natural things like mountains, rivers, earth, flowers, plants, wind, fire, lightning, thunder, etc. Like the Wind Dao Insight Chen Xi comprehended from the wind, or the Tidal Dao Insight that the Roc King comprehended from the tide; they were all types of Dao Insight.However, there was also a difference between Dao Insights, comprehending a strand of Dao Insight could only be considered as to have only just found the path and only starting to gain mastery. If one was able to understand all the profundities of the Dao, then one could be considered to have mastered a complete Dao Insight!Chen Xi\u2019s Wind Dao Insight could only be considered to have only just found the path, whereas the Tidal Dao Insight of the Roc King was a mastered, complete Dao Insight.Although both their cultivations in the Martial Dao were at the Dao Insight Stage, the difference between them was like the difference between the heavens and the earth!\u201cI comprehended the Tidal Dao Insight 5,000 years ago, then experienced 5,000 more years of understanding and tempering to repeatedly improve it. Only then did I completely master a complete Tidal Dao Insight that belonged to me. This nether river in my hands was formed from the essence of water refined by my Tidal Dao Insight, and it\u2019s able to allow me to exert the full might of the Tidal Dao Insight. The strength of its might isn\u2019t inferior to an earth-rank Magic Treasure, and even if I encounter a Golden Hall Realm cultivator, I still have the confidence to kill him, let alone you?\u201d The Roc King spoke with confidence and composure, and a domineering aura raged throughout his body. \u201cChen Xi, don\u2019t struggle anymore, submit!\u201d\u201cWant me to submit? Then defeat me first!\u201d Chen Xi grunted coldly, the eight Netherezim Flying Swords that revolved around him abruptly emitted a long cry as they transformed into eight dazzling sword lights that crisscrossed both horizontally and vertically as they moved to mince the Roc King.\u201cTruly a stubborn little fellow. Then I\u2019ll defeat you first!\u201d As he sighed faintly, the Roc King\u2019s palms suddenly grabbed towards the space before him, then fiercely pushed forward, as if he was pushing over a large mountain.Rumble!The black river suddenly transformed into a surging turbid wave that instantly flooded the sky within an area of 50km. When gazed at from afar, it was like a vast and mighty pitch-black Great River hung beneath the sky, and it arrived before Chen Xi in the blink of an eye.\u201cHmm?\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s face went slightly grim. Along with the appearance of the nether river, the Roc King had actually vanished into thin air! Chen Xi\u2019s heart went cold as he summoned back the eight Netherezim Flying Swords.Swish! Swish! Swish!Sounds of wind that were piercingly cold like blades emerged, raging like a hurricane, and every strand of wind was like a sharp sword. For a time, a myriad of sword blades slashed towards the river that assaulted straight at him, and the hurricane that contained Wind Dao Insight possessed extremely terrifying might. Even the black tide that was surging towards him was directly slashed into fine droplets before transforming into mist and vanishing.However, one wave had only just been suppressed, when a terrifying black river surged over from the distance, layer upon layer of waves flowed with it, and it was even greater in strength and impetus.\u201cKill!\u201d Chen Xi didn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest as he controlled the hurricane, and the eight Netherezim Flying Swords seemed like eight wind dragons that roared and danced wildly in the air as he moved to meet it head on,Wind Sword Insight was matchlessly fierce and swift and contained a myriad of changes. It was to break open one\u2019s shackles and to struggle open one\u2019s bindings; it was freedom!The water of the nether river roiled and surged like a tide. It seemed inexhaustible as each wave\u2019s might was stronger and more terrifying than the last. Whereas Chen Xi instead relied on the eight Netherezim Flying Swords and his Wind Dao Insight to slaughter without restraint, like a hard stone on the precipice.Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!The hurricane was like a sword as it crushed the tidewater into thousands of water droplets, yet was unable to completely eliminate them.\u201cRelying solely on the eight Netherezim Flying Swords isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s eyes were calm like icy snow as a grim light flashed within, then the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his right hand gave rise to a myriad of flickering lightning lights atop the flowing sword light condensed from his ice True Essence as he madly crushed the black waves that surged over from every direction, his imposing manner skyrocketing steadily!\u2026On a small hill 5km away from Moonhowl Ridge, the azure clothed and white haired Profound-vision Old Turtle King, and the Nine-tailed Fox King who had eyes that were like peaches and hair that scattered on his shoulders, were shocking standing atop the hill.Their gazes both looked at the black colored river below the distant sky, and the youth that was surrounded at the center of the river and waves.\u201cWhat a pity!\u201d The Old Turtle King sighed.\u201cWhat\u2019s a pity?\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King was stunned as he questioned.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d The Old Turtle King sighed with emotion. \u201cNot mentioning anything else, just look at this little fellow, his soul is extremely strong, and it\u2019s more than enough to control eight top-grade yellow-rank flying swords. His comprehension ability is extremely shocking, as his cultivation in the Martial Dao is already at the Dao Insight Stage, moreover, it\u2019s the Wind Dao Insight that\u2019s most difficult to be comprehended. But, he still hasn\u2019t understood the terror of the Tidal Dao Insight.\u201d\u201cThe tide rises one after the other, and the might of each progressive wave is more formidable than the last. The might at its strongest is able to easily crush a towering mountain, and his circumstances will become more and more dangerous if he relies only on his current strength.\u201d\u201cIf he\u2019s given a period of time, then relying on his comprehension ability, he would be completely capable of mastering a complete Wind Dao Insight. Although his cultivation would be inferior to the Roc King, he would still be in an undefeatable position. Unfortunately, what a pity.\u201d The Old Turtle King shook his head and sighed endlessly.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to feel pity for? If worst comes to worst, we can lend a hand and save him when he\u2019s about to die. Didn\u2019t you need something from him? Wouldn\u2019t he be grateful and seek to repay us once we save him?\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King instead had a relaxed expression as he lightly laughed.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d The Old Turtle King shook his head once more, and he said secretly in his heart.The eight Netherezim Flying Swords shot out both horizontally and vertically, Chen Xi held the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand as he took step by step forward, and numerous black colored enormous waves were crushed into droplets before vanishing.Chen Xi was extremely anxious in his heart.Splash! Splash! Splash!Another black colored tidal wave surged over with an aura even stronger and fiercer than the previous wave, and there was even the sharp aura of halberds vaguely carried within it.Bang! Bang! Bang!When Chen Xi annihilated the first wave of tidal waves with his Seventhgold Swordbamboo yet saw it was unable to make the tidal waves die out, he clenched his left fist right away, then punch after punch tore through the sky towards the tidal wave. The fist lights seemed material, containing the strength of Chen Xi\u2019s body that was at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm and a trace of indistinct and mysterious Shaman Energy as they roared out, thoroughly blasting the waves that had transformed into droplets to scatter and disappear completely.Chen Xi could only desperately fight on when surrounded by the nether river from all directions.\u201cHe\u2019s going to lose.\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King said unhurriedly, \u201cHe even used his body refinement cultivation that\u2019s only at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm, and he\u2019s undoubtedly making his last struggle. Should we save him?\u201dThe Old Turtle King shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s still a bit too early. Wait a while longer. He can still persist for some time.\u201d\u201cYou still want to wait?\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King said in surprise, \u201cIf we wait any longer, then even if we rescue him, he\u2019d probably have suffered an extremely heavy injury and become a complete cripple whose life is over.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d The Old Turtle King still persisted, and the gaze he looked at Chen Xi with seemed to vaguely be anticipating something.Slap!The time of making another cup of tea had passed, when Chen Xi was fighting with his utmost strength, a black tidal wave was like an enormous hammer that slammed down fiercely onto Chen Xi\u2019s body, and he was directly thrown flying over 30m away and a strand of dark red fresh blood appeared on the corners of his mouth.\u201cKill!\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s hair was disheveled and he didn\u2019t care about the blood that flowed out from the corners of his mouth. The instant his body fell from the impact, he\u2019d scurried back up right away, and the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand moved straight out to annihilate the black colored tidal wave that once again approached in assault.His body was already extremely exhausted, his True Essence almost consumed completely, yet a ball of surging flames blazed within Chen Xi\u2019s eyes. That was the flames of unyieldingness, persistence, and stubbornness!The time for making another cup of tea passed.Chen Xi\u2019s expression was already completely lifeless, as if he\u2019d fallen into possession by a devil, and his gaze was blank. If it wasn\u2019t for the eight Netherezim Flying Swords that danced about around him and the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand stabbing out, his current appearance was simply like a wooden puppet that had lost its soul!Countless scenes slipped past Chen Xi\u2019s mind, like floating lights and passing shadows, yet they were so clear.His impoverished life when he was young, his mother missing, his father leaving, his marriage contract being torn apart, the unending humiliation and ridicule, his grandfather\u2019s gaze of resentment and dejection\u2026The countless scenes fused together, transforming into a large hand that tightly choked his throat.He felt out of breath as the strong feeling of suffocation filled his entire body, as if he was a little insect that was enveloped by the web of a spider, unable to struggle, and could only wait for death.He shouted at the top of his voice, roaring with rage and unwillingness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the eyes of everyone present, Chen Xi was like a rice straw within the black river, like a drifting leaf that floated erratically, and there was a chance he would be overturned and destroyed by the tidal waves at any moment.He was in a critical situation!\u201cThe King is formidable as expected! This level of ability is simply like the might to move mountains and boil seas! That kid is dead for sure!\u201d\u201cOf course, the King has occupied Moonhowl Ridge for countless years. Did you see that fellow being able to harm a hair of the King? I knew the moment this kid appeared that it would surely be difficult for him to flee from the calamity of death this time!\u201dWithin the area of 50km, all the demons endlessly exclaimed with admiration as they gazed at the battle in the sky. They were even more convinced that the human youth had no chance of turning the tides under the Tidal Dao Insight of the Roc King.The uproarious sounds of discussion similarly entered into the center of the mountain.The expression of Du Qingxi and the other went incomparably anxious, if it wasn\u2019t for rescuing them, would Chen Xi have fallen into such a state?He shouldn\u2019t die!\u201cThis fellow is actually going to lose? Truly too infuriating! If he knew it was going to be like this, then wouldn\u2019t it have been better if he didn\u2019t come? Giving others hope, yet disappointing in the end! Could it be that all men like to show off their courage and act rashly?\u201d Murong Wei shrieked endlessly, her beautiful face already completely warped.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed disappointing. I thought he had the ability to turn the tide, but who knew that he couldn\u2019t amount to much. Alas.\u201d Cang Bin seconded Murong Wei as he sighed endlessly.\u201cWhat did you say?! Fucking say it again!\u201d Duanmu Ze roared in rage, as he truly never imagined that such a shameless person existed in the world.\u201cDon\u2019t waste your strength on them. What\u2019s the point in getting angry with these types of unscrupulous and shameless fellows?\u201d Song Lin said slowly.Du Qingxi didn\u2019t speak, but in her heart she seriously looked down upon Cang Bin and Murong Wei, and she couldn\u2019t be bothered to make a fuss about it with them.\u2026\u201cEh!\u201d\u201cSomething\u2019s happening!\u201dUnder the gazes of everyone, Chen Xi who was surrounded from all angles by the black colored tidal wave in the distant sky had suddenly stopped all movement, and he actually didn\u2019t resist any longer!\u201cWhat\u2019s this kid doing?\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King frowned, with the strength of his vision, he was naturally able to see that not only had Chen Xi abandoned all resistance, he had even closed his eyes.The nearby Profound-vision Old Turtle King didn\u2019t say anything and only locked his gaze tightly upon Chen Xi, and a trace of excitement was actually vaguely noticeable on his skinny face that was covered in wrinkles, seeming to be in anticipation and nervousness.Swoosh!The Roc King in black robed appeared suddenly within the black colored tidal wave, and as he gazed at Chen Xi who was soon to be swallowed by his Tidal Dao Insight, his jade and shiny eyes lacked the delight from approaching victory, but instead had a trace of bewilderment.Suspicion grew wildly within the heart of the Roc King and he secretly shook his head endlessly.Bang!An enormous 330m tidal wave struck, sending Chen Xi flying over 100 meters away like an inconspicuous ant. His hair was disheveled and fresh blood flowed from his five orifices.Bang! Bang! Bang!Before Chen Xi\u2019s body could even hit the ground, another few more tidal waves struck, striking him to the point the skin on his entire body was covered in wounds, and blood gushed out like a fountain, tainting his clothes completely. From afar, Chen Xi was like a man made of blood, and his appearance was extremely wretched.But his eyes were still closed as before, and his expression was inexplicably calm, causing him to seem extremely strange.\u201cSomething\u2019s not right, there\u2019s something strange with this fellow.\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King spoke in surprise. In his eyes, Chen Xi could be said to be in constant danger, on the brink of death, as if he might perish at any moment. But only after seeing it clearly did he notice to his surprise that there seemed to be a jet of shapeless viscous force around Chen Xi, and no matter how the tidal waves struck him from all directions, more than half of the force from them would be dispersed by this viscous force and not even 20% of its might struck Chen Xi\u2019s body!A trace of dense curiosity gushed out from the charming peached shaped eyes of the Nine-tailed Fox King.It wasn\u2019t that he\u2019d never encountered young cultivators with peerless natural talent, but it was still a first for him to encounter one like Chen Xi. Moreover, the time since cultivating of Chen Xi seemed to be extremely short and Chen Xi\u2019s age was extremely young, yet a little fellow like this was able to persist under the Tidal Dao Insight of the Roc King until now. Chen Xi was simply a freak to him.\u201cYou\u2019ve noticed as well?\u201d The Old Turtle King\u2019s gaze burned as his voice revealed a trace of unfathomableness, then he suddenly stretched his hand out to point at the distant sky as he shouted out loudly. \u201cLook, quickly!\u201d\u2026In his hazy consciousness, Chen Xi dreamt of a sky filled with stars.Within the clear night sky, a myriad of dazzling and resplendent stars hung in the sky, as they emitted chilly silver light. They followed a profound trajectory as they whirled around, dancing in the sky. A cool breeze whipped past the spacious grassland, and the fine and supple grass was like a wave as they flapped within the low howls of the wind.At that time, his mind was pure and clear.At that time, only the myriad of stars remained in his eyes, it was like an enormous hand used the heavens and earth as talisman paper and the stars as the talisman brush to paint out the mysterious and profound trajectory of the stars.At this moment, he saw the numerous stars that studded the sky completely once again, and the ancient and vast sigh seemed to once again sound out by his ears.The countless scenes of the past and the past dejection, unwillingness, hardships, ridicule, and wasted time of doing nothing had all transformed into ash. When faced with the myriad of stars, the numerous and complicated grudges of the mortal world and the past incidents that caused him to feel enraged and unwilling, seemed to be so insignificant and not worthy of mention.His mind became completely peaceful, like a massive rock that remained towering and immovable even after experiencing 10,000 years of wind and rain.His gaze once again returned to calm, like a vast lake without ripples.In his mind, numerous scenes flashed into appearance once again \u2014 his grandfather\u2019s gaze that held expectation, his mother\u2019s affectionate repeated warning, the worship on his younger brother\u2019s immature face, the sincere and firm dissuasion of Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three\u2026At this moment, an indescribable profound aura poured into his entire body, and the soul within his sea of consciousness was advancing and transforming at an unbelievable speed!As if he was being reborn in this hopeless situation.Bang!A loud bang echoed out within his entire soul, as if it was the dawn of the world, and the scenes within the surrounding 500km were clearly reflected within his heart, like the demons that were concealed within their lairs, the roiling and surging nether river, the uneasy and anxious expressions of Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three\u2026 Even to the extent that even the shape of a stone on the ground, the veins on a leaf, and the antennae of an ant were all clearly visible in the minutest detail. In addition to that was the winds of freedom that were everywhere!Chen Xi opened his eyes. His gaze was clear without a shred of impurities, and his expression was neither joyous nor sorrowful, like an ancient Buddha that had comprehended karma in meditation, and his Dao Heart was completely unsoiled.\u201cChen Xi, you\u2019re too disappointing. Since it\u2019s like this, then go to hell!\u201d Right at this moment, accompanied by the explosive shout of the Roc King that was high pitched like a howl, the nether river in mid air suddenly started surging, like a black dragon who\u2019d just awaken from its slumber and was swaying its colossal body that was continuous like a mountain ridge. It emitted a roar that was like muffled thunder as it surged towards Chen Xi that was tiny like an ant.Like a dragon\u2019s roar and seeming to possess the shape of a dragon, even the heavens and earth seemed to tremble and the sky seemed to be about to be torn into pieces. The turbulent flow of spirit energy were like blades that shot out with a bang. The rocks, plants, and river within an area of 50km were pulverized, and the demons that were located comparatively closed were even swept flying over 300m away before falling to the ground and ceaselessly spitting blood.For a time, the sky and earth dimmed, as if it had fallen into the night that was like the end of the world.The Roc King was going for the kill!The same thought flashed past the minds of everyone present in unison, the thought that Chen Xi would probably lose his life under this strike\u2026\u201cWind, rise!\u201d Right at this moment, a voice that was calm and indifferent resounded out. The voice started soft and became loud, and when it passed through the roiling black tidal wave, it was already like a resonant voice that resounded through within the entire heaven and earth.A mere two words, yet seemed to possess a miraculous magical power to fly in the air for a long time. When heard, it was like listening to a strand of gentle wind whispering by the ear.A good deal of the demons present were stunned in unison.Right at this moment, they suddenly noticed that black dragon in midair that was formed from the surging nether river seemed as if it was bound on the spot by someone. It stopped in midair, not raging with waves nor emitting any sounds of surging tidewater, and it lost the terrifying strength that made other\u2019s hearts palpitate with fear\u2026 Even to the extent that there wasn\u2019t a single movement from it in the slightest!Motionless!As if it was grasped by a shapeless enormous hand, as if it was frozen by cold and fierce winds and snow, and the scene was extremely bizarre.Rumble!It was like the heavens and earth were roaring, violent winds raged within an area of 5,000km, surging as they gathered towards there like sharks that had smelt blood. The violent and explosive sound seemed as if it desired to shatter the eardrums, and was extremely astonishing.There were even some demon-kind with slightly inferior strengths that were directly knocked out by this sound.Whereas in the distance, the Profound-vision Old Turtle King suddenly laughed soundlessly as a wisp of realization gushed out from deep within his eyes, and he muttered excitedly. \u201cHauled into the nine layers of hell to become a dragon\u2026 It\u2019s really him\u2026 It\u2019s really him!\u201d\u201cSword, descend!\u201d The calm and indifferent voice sounded out once again. Then, everyone saw that Chen Xi whose hair was disheveled and entire body dripping with blood stepped onto the motionless nether river as he rose into the sky, and the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in his hand slashed down.A scene that was bound to be forever imprinted into the hearts of every demon appeared.Along with Chen Xi\u2019s sword slashing down, the gales in the heaven and earth swiftly transformed into an incorporeal wind sword that was an entire 33km long. Under a wave of droning that was like clear cries, numerous circles of ripples formed from the strong vibrations caused by the friction in the air spread out, seeming as if the heavens and the earth were in resonance because of the incorporeal wind sword. Whereas under this resonance, the incorporeal wind sword abruptly vanished, as if it had teleported.Kacha! Kacha!The nether river that was windy and rose and fell like a mountain ridge was chopped into two, then like shattered glazed glass, it transformed into a myriad of tiny water droplets which were instantly evaporated by the vibration in the air before they could even fall to the ground.Bang!The momentum of the incorporeal wind sword didn\u2019t reduce in the slightest as it slashed onto the ground, and it left behind a terrifying and bottomless enormous ravine that was almost 33km long, whereas the hills, rivers, rocks, and plants within were all crushed into powder.The might of a single slash was fierce and swift to this extent!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 FriendshipPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83 \u2013 FriendshipThe heaven swayed and the earth shook, suffusing dust and smoke into the air, and it only returned to calmness after a long time.Silence!A strange silence enveloped the surroundings, and only the sound of wind still whistled as it swept past.The gazes of everyone had converged in midair, converged onto the figure that wore clothes tainted in blood, yet had a backbone that was ramrod straight. They seemed to be unable to believe it, as if the strike from before had muddled their heads. They gaped, yet were unable to make a single sound for a long time.Their gazes were already filled with shock and astonishment.Hiss!It was unknown who gasped, but the originally weak sound instead seemed so ear piercing within this silent atmosphere.\u201cThis fellow is simply not human!\u201d\u201cA counterattack from a hopeless situation?\u201d\u201cMy god! The King\u2019s Tidal Dao Insight was actually destroyed by him!\u201dThe demons burst into an uproar as various sounds of surprised exclamations rose and fell, as if only by crying out in this way would they be able to vent the shock and astonishment in their hearts.\u201cHe actually comprehended a complete Wind Dao Insight in a hopeless situation. This level of comprehension ability is a bit too terrifying\u2026\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King muttered.\u201cTerrifying? I feel it\u2019s extremely normal as he ought to be a person like this.\u201d The Profound-vision Old Turtle King had an appearance as if what happened was within reason, and he seemed to feel it was extremely normal for Chen Xi to do such a shocking act.Pu!A figure abruptly appeared in midair. Shockingly, it was the Roc King. At this moment, his face was pale to the extent it was almost translucent, his figure shaky and his steps staggering, and he couldn\u2019t refrain from violently spitting out a mouthful of blood.\u201cHow can this be possible?! How can this be possible?!\u201d The Roc King\u2019s pupils dilated as he gazed upon the distant towering figure that seemed like a man made of blood, and his expression was as if he\u2019d seen a ghost.Not only did this strike of Chen Xi\u2019s slash his Tidal Dao Insight into pieces, it even heavily injured him. If it wasn\u2019t for him dodging in time, he would have lost his life. Even then, he didn\u2019t have the strength to continue battling.These thoughts swiftly flashed past the Roc King\u2019s mind, and in almost an instant, he\u2019d already made a decision before turning around and fleeing.Chen Xi raised his head indifferently as he commanded in his heart.Swoosh!A Netherezim Flying Sword tore through the sky, like a bolt of lightning concealed within the wind. The Roc King was utterly unable to dodge as it pierced through the back of his head, then the sword light revolved to accurately and cleanly cut off his head.Splash!Blood gushed out, and the Roc King wasn\u2019t even able to let out a miserable howl before becoming a headless corpse that crashed down from midair.Swoosh!Chen Xi didn\u2019t spare another glance on the Roc King\u2019s corpse after doing all this, and he turned to plunge downwards, and his direction was shockingly the center of Moonhowl Ridge.No one dared obstruct him, because at this moment, Chen Xi had already become a god of death in the hearts of the demons present, and an expert that annihilated the Roc King with a single sword strike!\u2014\u2014Within the center of the mountain.\u201cWhat happened? What is there no movement outside? Chen Xi is fine, right?\u201d Duanmu Ze was anxious and bewildered. Earlier, an extremely terrifying airflow had swept past, and it nearly crushed the center of the mountain into destruction. However, at this moment, there wasn\u2019t a single sound from the outside world, and it was instead strangely silent.Du Qingxi and Song Lin were similarly extremely bewildered and anxious.\u201cWe\u2019re finished\u2026 Chen Xi is dead, and we\u2019re going to be refined into medicinal pills. If he knew this would happen, he ought to have saved us first then go battle that Roc King. But now, our hope is destroyed and even the opportunity to flee is lost.\u201d Murong Wei was scared out of her wits and she grieved as if she\u2019d lost her parents.\u201cShut up!\u201d Duanmu Ze lashed out.\u201cShameless!\u201d Song Lin said in disdain.\u2026For a time, a heated argument played out once again. Because of the unknown outcome of the battle and because of the silent and oppressive atmosphere, the gloominess and rage within the hearts of everyone couldn\u2019t be restrained any longer and completely exploded out, like adding oil to a wok, becoming more and more intense by the moment.It was at this moment that a wave of footsteps sounded out, causing the sounds of argument within the room to abruptly vanish to become extremely silent, and only the approaching sound of footsteps reverberated in the air.\u201cWe\u2019re finished, our blood and soul is going to be extracted.\u201d Murong Wei didn\u2019t dare watch and closed her eyes shut as she turned dreary from terror.The others, including Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three, were extremely panic-stricken in their hearts. As the footsteps approached, their heartbeats inexplicably quickened, thumping loud like striking a drum.A figure slowly arrived before the door.The figure had disheveled hair and clothes tainted in blood, and his entire body effused strands of the pungent smell of blood, yet his backbone was still ramrod straight. His facial features remained calm and indifferent as before, and the peaceful and calm aura on his body seemed to flush away the oppressive and depressing atmosphere in the prison, causing the moods of others to be unable to help from becoming calm.\u201cChen Xi!\u2019\u201cYou\u2026 actually didn\u2019t die!?\u201d\u201cThis is real?\u201dWhen they saw the appearance of the person clearly, Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin were all stunned, seeming to be unable to believe it. They only let out a wave of surprised exclamations after a short while, and their moods were already extremely excited.Chen Xi laughed silently when he saw the heartfelt expressions of excitement and jubilance on the three of them, and he lifted the Seventhgold Swordbamboo to slash the thick chains on the iron pillars into pieces before rescuing Du Qingxi and the others one by one.Due to their True Essence being sealed while locked up here, their bodies had become extremely weak long ago, and at the instant they obtained freedom, their bodies swayed and almost fell down on their butts.\u201cYou\u2026 You wouldn\u2019t have really killed the Roc King, right?\u201d In the distance, Cang Bin\u2019s face was full of suspicion and he seemed unable to accept this fact.\u201cIs this question very important? We\u2019ve already been rescued. Once we return to Dragon Lake City, I\u2019ll prepare more gifts to bestow upon Chen Xi, I can\u2019t let him have done all this for nothing. Where there is service rendered, then there are rewards, right?\u201d Murong Wei limbered up her muscles and recovered her reserved appearance, and the arrogance within her bones caused her to have a flavor of a superior person giving alms when she spoke.Chen Xi didn\u2019t pay any attention to the two and instead looked at Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three as he nodded and said, \u201cThe Roc King is already dead, but the Azure Python King is probably nearby. We should quickly leave this place.\u201dThere was one more thing that Chen Xi didn\u2019t mention. After he utilized the final incorporeal wind sword, the True Essence within his body had already dried up, and his body was riddled with injuries, causing it to be impossible for him to be involved in another battle. At the moment, he was already like an arrow at the end of its flight, and he was purely relying on his immense will to forcefully support himself.\u201cWait a moment first.\u201d Du Qingxi suddenly arrived by Chen Xi\u2019s side, then bent towards his ears. \u201cLend me the sword in your hand.\u201dChen Xi was stunned.Right when he was stunned, Du Qingxi had already taken the Seventhgold Swordbamboo from his hand in an extremely natural manner.\u201cEh, Big Sister Qingxi, what did you take the sword for?\u201d Murong Wei asked wonderingly.Swish!Right at the moment she finished speaking, Du Qingxi swung the Seventhgold Swordbamboo, directly slicing through her throat, and a huge hole was instantly sliced open on her throat and fresh blood sprayed out. She sprung her eyes wide open, seeming to be unable to believe it, yet her body had already fallen limply on the ground and ceaselessly convulsed before ceasing to breathe.Du Qingxi didn\u2019t notice all this as after she cut Murong Wei\u2019s throat, the Seventhgold Swordbamboo in her hand didn\u2019t slow down in the slightest as she stabbed towards Cang Bin.\u201cHow dare you!?\u201d Cang Bin noticed something was off long ago, and he fiercely retreated backward when he saw Du Qingxi\u2019s actions. But his True Essence was sealed and his body fragile, so his speed of retreat wasn\u2019t swift. Whereas on the side, Duanmu Ze and Song Li seemed to be in tacit understanding since before, and from left and right, they came at Cang Bin in a pincer, completely sealing off his path of retreat.\u201cYou all\u2026\u201dSwish!His voice stopped abruptly. Cang Bin held his own throat until he fell onto the ground and died. His eyes still stared at Du Qingxi hatefully, seeming to have never imagined that this chilly woman that was always silent would actually be so vicious and ruthless.Du Qingxi killing Murong Wei and Cang Bin successively with two sword strikes had struck the other three people with terror. They\u2019d all followed Su Jiao to enter the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, and in other words, they and Du Qingxi\u2019s group were from hostile groups. At this moment, they were naturally worried that Du Qingxi would silence them as well.\u201cXue Jing, Mo Han, Di Hongtu, I won\u2019t kill all of you today. Go back and tell Su Jiao and the clans of Murong Wei and Cang Bin that it was I, Du Qingxi, that killed them. If they want to take revenge, then come at me!\u201d Du Qingxi coldly gazed at the three of them as she spoke word for word, her tone was icy cold, clear, and powerful.\u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cCount me in.\u201dDuanmu Ze and Song Lin spoke out in unison, and they both smiled at each other when they finished.Chen Xi was shocking in his heart, then raised his eyes to look at the three for a long time before saying, \u201cThank you.\u201dHe naturally knew why Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three acted in this way. It was because they wanted to prove themselves to him and they wanted to use this sort of resolute actions to help share the pressure the powers behind these people would bring upon him.\u201cI thought you would be extremely shocked, but I never imagined that you were far more composed than my expectations,\u201d Du Qingxi smiled as he said, then wiped off the blood on the Seventhgold Swordbamboo before turning around the handle of the sword and returning it to Chen Xi.\u201cSince it has already happened, what good is surprise?\u201d Chen Xi received the Seventhgold Swordbamboo and his gaze looked at the three as he said slowly, \u201cNot to mention I killed Chai Letian and Yu Haobai a few days ago, I\u2019ve been unafraid of everything since long ago.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. I let you down in the past, but I\u2019ll absolutely not let you down again in the future. You took me as a brother, and if I, Duanmu Ze, let my brother down again, then I\u2019m even worse than pigs and dogs.\u201d\u201cGreat! I wanted to kill them since long ago!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re dead? What\u2019s done is done, there\u2019s no big deal about it. We\u2019ll face everything together.\u201dDu Qingxi\u2019s group of three were stunned when they heard him, then spoke out at almost the exact same time. The content of what they said was different, yet all revealed intention to face everything together with Chen Xi, and as soon as they finished speaking, the three of them glanced at each other and couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s heart was warm, and he felt that rescuing Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three this time was correct. Not only did he remedy the guilt in his heart, he even regained their friendship, and he obtained both their respect and trust.This type of feeling was extremely comfortable, and it was the first time that Chen Xi had experienced the happiness of friendship since he was young.He was alone and friendless for too long, and was mocked and ridiculed by his peers too much. So he naturally yearned even more for this feeling that was difficult to come by.At this moment, Chen Xi was happy, but he was bad at expressing it, and he could only silently remember it and brand it within his heart.Right at the moment when Chen Xi and the others were about to leave, the Profound-vision Old Turtle King and the Nine-tailed Fox King had arrived unexpectedly. The Old Turtle King grinned as he cupped his fist, and his voice was warm, causing one to feel as if bathing in spring breeze. \u201cLittle Brother Chen Xi, I\u2019m Xuan Jing, along with my friend Qing Qiu, we\u2019ve come to have an audience with you, Fellow Daoist.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 The Old Turtle Kings Purpose In ComingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 84 \u2013 The Old Turtle King\u2019s Purpose In ComingChen Xi thought in his heart and instantly confirmed the identity of the two people.[1. Their names are directly derived from their demon king titles, and that\u2019s why Chen Xi was able to recognize them right away.]\u201cWatch out!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re the Profound-vision Old Turtle King and the Nine-tailed Fox King!\u201dDu Qingxi and the others recognized the identity of the two and their expression instantly went grim as they went on alert and ready for combat.Although they had never seen the two demon kings, the names of the two were like thunderclaps that struck the ears. How could they not know that these two were existences that were even stronger and mysterious than the Roc King?However, in the eyes of Du Qingxi and the others, no matter if it was the azure clothed white haired Old Turtle King or the Nine-tailed Fox King with shoulder-length hair and eyes that were shaped like peaches, the two of them were very different compared to other demon-kind. They both had restrained spirits and indifferent auras, and there actually wasn\u2019t a shred of demonic qi fluctuations in their bodies! If it wasn\u2019t for the Old Turtle King taking the initiative to proclaim his identity, they would have nearly guessed that these two demon kings were human cultivators\u2026This also proved from another angle that the cultivations of these two demon kings had probably already attained an unbelievable level!When they thought of this, the hearts of Du Qingxi and the others constricted and they were extremely anxious. They\u2019d only just been saved, could it be that they would be captured once again?\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. If these two wanted to make a move against us, then we\u2019d probably already be dead.\u201d Chen Xi waved his hand as he calmly stared at these two demon kings that had arrived unexpectedly with eyes that didn\u2019t contain a trace of fear.\u201cYou flatter us. However, the two of us did indeed come here because we have something to request of Little Brother Chen Xi.\u201d The Old Turtle King smiled warmly, and in his heart, he was instead endlessly praising Chen Xi\u2019s acute perception.Crash!While the Old Turtle King spoke, the Nine-tailed Fox King swing his sleeve, and the floor was fully piled with various treasures that the aura of treasures circulated upon. There were spirit herbs, medicinal pills, spirit liquids, various other materials of bizarre shapes, and there even were a few Magic Treasures with formidable auras!\u201cYou killed the Roc King and these are your spoils. I gathered them for you, have a look.\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King lightly smiled.The attention of Du Qingxi and the others were completely attracted by this pile of spoils. They grew up within rich and powerful great clans since they were young, and their gazes were all incomparably sharp. They were practically able to discern with a glance that all the various treasure on the ground were extremely valuable, and if exchanged into spirit liquids, it would probably be worth over 500,000kg of spirit liquids!500,000 kg of spirit liquids! That was an amount that could allow a Violet Palace Realm cultivator to break through to the Golden Hall Realm in one go!But, it made sense when thought about, as one of the seven great demon kings who had lived for 10,000 years, it was within reason for the Roc King to possess so many treasures.However, they were still slightly unable to believe it. According to what the Nine-tailed Fox King said, he seemed to want to gift all these treasures to Chen Xi\u2026Chen Xi has already instantly understood within his heart, yet he didn\u2019t spare a glance to the various treasures on the ground and asked. \u201cI wonder for what matter did the both of you come here for?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry Little Brother, it\u2019s absolutely a good thing that\u2019s only advantageous but nothing to lose from. It\u2019s an extremely good thing! But let\u2019s not talk about this matter first, we should leave this place first. Hmm, let\u2019s go to Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, that place seems to be Little Brother Chen Xi\u2019s place of repose.\u201d The Old Turtle King let out a hearty laugh. At this moment, he admired Chen Xi even more for being able to be so composed when faced with precious treasures. If it was any other person of the younger generation, that person would probably have been completely captivated and obsessed with the precious treasures since long ago.\u201cKeep it. These things are yours in the first place, you don\u2019t have to worry about owing us anything.\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King joked, his pair of clear peach shaped eyes narrowed into a line and was extremely evil and charming.It wasn\u2019t good for Chen Xi to decline when it had come to this point, so he put away all the treasures on the ground into his storage ring right away.Under these circumstances, if he were to refuse again, he would seem to be too pretentious and rude. Although he wasn\u2019t able to guess what exactly these two demon kings wanted to do, it wasn\u2019t a bad thing according to his current observations. After all, if it was a bad thing, these two fellows probably wouldn\u2019t be so polite with him.\u2026A treasured vessel of simple and grand make broke through the layers of air as it swiftly flew towards the extremely distant skies.On the vessel, Chen Xi stood there while holding the handrail, feeling as if years had passed arose within his heart as he gazed at Moonhowl Ridge that was swiftly disappearing behind him.\u201cTsk tsk, if I\u2019m not wrong, this vessel is a graded Magic Treasure!\u201d\u201cYeah, its entire body is engraved with various spirit gathering talisman markings, and it\u2019s able to absorb the spirit energy of heaven and earth by itself and transform the spirit energy into fuel. It completely doesn\u2019t require expanding anything for it to fly for long periods of time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s indeed an extremely precious treasure vessel.\u201dDu Qingxi and the others were standing at the side, and they endlessly praised after carefully sizing up the structure of this treasured vessel.This treasured vessel belonged to the Old Turtle King. When sitting within it, it was stable and comfortable, and one couldn\u2019t feel any airflow in the slightest. Moreover, there were beds, tables, chairs, spirit flowers, fine herbs, and even various types of fine wine and fresh fruits filled with spirit energy contained indoors. It was simply like a palace that could fly in the sky and was extremely comfortable.\u201cLittle Brother Chen Xi, how is this treasured vessel of mine?\u201d The Old Turtle King stood by Chen Xi\u2019s side as he asked with a grin.\u201cReally not bad.\u201d Chen Xi nodded, he was taken completely by surprise when he\u2019d just ascended into the vessel, because according to his observation, not only was this treasured vessel comfortable, it was also extremely sturdy and was completely on par with a graded Magic Treasure.A graded Magic Treasure was divided into four ranks, namely the heaven-rank, earth-rank, profound-rank, and yellow-rank; and every rank was divided again into four grades, namely the low-grade, intermediate-grade, high-grade and top grade. Chen Xi was unable to discern what grade or rank this treasured vessel was, but he was extremely certain that it was surely a graded Magic Treasure without a doubt.\u201cHahaha! If you like it then I\u2019ll gift this treasured vessel to you.\u201d The Old Turtle King laughed loudly, then decided. \u201cDon\u2019t refuse it, this treasure can withstand a full force strike of a Golden Hall Realm cultivator, moreover, it\u2019s able to fly a distance of 5,000km in two hours. Keep it by your side as a means of defending yourself.\u201d\u201cHow could I do that?\u201d Chen Xi was unable to accept it.\u201cKeeping this thing is useless to me. If you don\u2019t take it, then I\u2019ll destroy it once we arrive at Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain!\u201d The Old Turtle King feigned anger.How could Chen Xi still refuse when the Old Turtle King had already spoken to such an extent? But the wonder in his heart grew denser and denser.Before long, the treasured vessel had flown to Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.Mu Kui was cultivating and he couldn\u2019t help but be dumbstruck when he saw the treasured vessel descending. But when he saw Chen Xi walk out from within, he stomped on the ground and leaped up, and he was wild with joy as he dashed out violently and shouted in excitement. \u201cSenior, you didn\u2019t die\u2026 You didn\u2019t die\u2026\u201dWhen he saw Mu Kui so happy, Chen Xi was extremely happy as well, and he gave a rare tease. \u201cWere you so eagerly looking forward to my death?\u201dMu Kui\u2019s face flushed red and he shook his head like a rattle drum. \u201cHow could I\u2026? How could I\u2026?\u201dChen Xi felt amused and inexplicably moved when he saw Mu Kui excited to the point of being unable to speak clearly, and he patted Mu Kui\u2019s shoulder as he changed the topic. \u201cGuests have arrived, aren\u2019t you going to make preparations?\u201d\u201cOh, Okay.\u201d Mu Kui noticed the Old Turtle King and the Nine-tailed Fox King standing by Chen Xi\u2019s side as they chatted and laughed together, and they seemed to have an extremely good relationship with Chen Xi, causing him to feel even more admiration towards Chen Xi\u2019s ability. He immediately said nothing more and dashed off into the abode like a wisp of smoke to go prepare some fragrant fruits and fine wine.\u201cThis wolf demon has a very genuine character. It\u2019s simply an extremely great good fortune of his to be able to follow by Little Brother Chen Xi\u2019s side, and even I can\u2019t help but be envious of him.\u201d The Old Turtle King smiled as he flattered.Nearby, the Nine-tailed Fox King also nodded with a smile as well.Only where there was a request, would an expression be made. Chen Xi understood this principle but didn\u2019t point it out, and he nodded as he said, \u201cMu Kui is not bad indeed, I look extremely favorably upon him.\u201dThe banquet was quickly prepared, and Chen Xi and the others took their seats before drinking wine and talking with the Old Turtle King and Nine-tailed Fox King.After drinking to a slightly tipsy state, the Old Turtle King said nonchalantly, \u201cLittle Brother Chen Xi, do you know of the past of the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range?\u201dChen Xi thought in his heart, then cupped his hands. \u201cSenior Xuan Jing, please provide me with your guidance.\u201dThe Nine-tailed Fox King interrupted from the side. \u201cThe exhaustion on the faces of these Fellow Daoists are difficult to conceal, I presume all of you suffered many hardships at the hands of the Roc King. How about this? All of you can go rest first and don\u2019t have to give consideration to us.\u201dHis words were filled with the intent of driving them away.Du Qingxi and the others were naturally able to discern this, but they were indeed too exhausted, as their True Essence was sealed until today and it hadn\u2019t completely recovered yet, so they immediately left.Up to this point, only Chen Xi and the two demon kings remained.\u201cThis depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range has already existed for 500,000 years, but it\u2019s completely isolated from the world. Not only are human cultivators unable to enter, even the demon beasts within are unable to leave.\u201d The Old Turtle King spoke with deep emotion. \u201cMost worrying of all is that there\u2019s a layer of strange restriction here. It\u2019s utterly impossible for any demon-king to break through from the Violet Palace Realm and advance into the Golden Hall Realm, let alone cultivating to a higher realm of attaining immortality and ascending to the peak of the Grand Dao.\u201dChen Xi was stunned. \u201cDidn\u2019t the Roc King want to refine some Bloodsoul Fortune Pills with the intention of advancing to the Golden Hall Realm?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d The Old Turtle King replied. \u201cBut that\u2019s only an act of insanity before death. After all, his lifespan was about to end, and he had to do this for the sake of living.\u201dThe nearby Nine-tailed Fox King grunted coldly. \u201cThat Roc King was an idiot. He saw all of you suddenly appearing here and thought that good fortune had arrived, so he wanted to refine all of you into Bloodsoul Fortune Pills. Yet he didn\u2019t know that even if he was successful in refining the pills, it would be absolutely impossible for him to advance to the Golden Hall Realm.\u201d\u201cWhy is it like this?\u201d Chen Xi asked in amazement.\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d When he spoke to here, the Old Turtle King paused, his expression carried a strand of deep reverence and he only sighed after some time. \u201cBecause, 500,000 years ago, a mysterious and formidable treasure fell here. The restriction that confined an area of 50,000km of the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range is precisely caused by a strand of aura emitted by it!\u201dNo matter how firm Chen Xi\u2019s Dao Heart was, he still couldn\u2019t help but gasp and said in surprise, \u201cExactly what treasure is so formidable?\u201dThe Old Turtle King looked up into the sky, and his expression became incomparably respectful as he muttered. \u201cA treasure that can possess such might is naturally the treasure that caused the three dimensions to be in chaos during the primordial era and caused the blood of primordial beings from all the heavens to flow into a river \u2014 The Mysterious River Diagram!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 River DiagramPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85 \u2013 River DiagramIn an instant, a myriad of enormous waves surged in Chen Xi\u2019s heart.\u201cHave you heard of the River Diagram? It was the most mysterious diagram in the primordial era. Numerous gods and devils of the primordial era used it to comprehend their own path in the Dao. They peeked into the secrets of the heavens to master the profound meaning of the Grand Dao and ascended to the highest summit of the Dao. It was precisely because of this that every appearance of the River Diagram was accompanied by slaughter. This slaughter caused upheaval within the three dimensions and disturbed the six paths of reincarnation. That doomsday-like scene of various figures with remarkable ability fighting over the River Diagram, just thinking about it sends a chill down one\u2019s spine.\u201d\u201cLuckily, the River Diagram vanished after the end of the primordial era, and that terrifying scene of gods and devils entangled in battle never appeared again. It\u2019s probably been 1,000,000 years since then. If it wasn\u2019t for Mom having read the ancient books of the clan when I was young, I would be completely unaware of the River Diagram\u2019s name.\u201dIn his mind, the words of his mother resounded once again, like flowing music from a zither, agilely ringing out, causing Chen Xi to be reminiscent and shocked.Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but think of the vast and aged Fuxi Divine Statue in his sea of consciousness. Senior Fuxi had observed the River Diagram to divine the Grand Dao of the changes of the secrets of heaven and ascend the peak of the Grand Dao to achieve supreme glory. How terrifying an existence the River Diagram actually was could be seen from this; it was simply a first-rate treasure in the entire world!Moreover, Chen Xi had once heard Ji Yu say that the Fuxi Divine Statue in his sea of consciousness contained a strand of the River Diagram\u2019s true essence, but he still hadn\u2019t understood the profundities within it until today. At this moment, when he heard the Old Turtle King speak about the River Diagram, he couldn\u2019t help but think in his heart.\u201cRiver Diagram? Impossible! How could such a mysterious existence fall to this poor and ordinary lousy mountain range?!\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s voice suddenly sounded out in his heart.He seemed to be slightly anxious and doubtful, and he said after pondering for a moment, \u201cHowever, you should reconfirm it. After all, that River Diagram is extremely mysterious. If it really fell here, then it\u2019s an enormous good fortune that you absolutely must not miss. That year, my Master was comprehending the Grand Dao at the bank of a river when he obtained it by chance. Unfortunately, at the instant my Master had just comprehended a Grand Dao, it vanished into thin air. No matter how my Master searched, he was unable to find it again. It\u2019s extremely miraculous.\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019m wondering now is why would they look for me? Could it be that they know I possess the True Body Brand of Senior Fuxi in my sea of consciousness?\u201d Chen Xi wondered.\u201cHmm?\u201d Ji Yu was startled, then went silent for a long time, before seeming to notice something as he said in realization, \u201cI understand now. So it\u2019s an old soft-shelled turtle. During the primordial era, the soft-shelled turtle family understood divination via astrology, and are most skilled at divining the changes in a person within a year in the past and future. I presume this soft-shelled turtle noticed something through divination, and only then did he look for you.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Chen Xi immediately understood as well.\u201cThis won\u2019t do. This matter is of great importance. The moment the River Diagram appears, it will surely draw the attention of almighty figures in the heavens and earth. Look like I have to show up and meet them\u2026\u201d Ji Yu said resolutely, his tone carrying a trace of heavy seriousness.\u2014\u2014During the time Chen Xi was lost in thought, the Old Turtle King and Nine-tailed Fox King looked at each other, but they didn\u2019t disturb Chen Xi. They instead picked up their wine cups to carefully savor the wine as they communicated via voice transmission.\u201cLooks like you were right, this little fellow knows of the River Diagram as well.\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King said swiftly, and the excitement in his voice couldn\u2019t be concealed. \u201cI\u2019ve already been held up at the perfection-stage of the Violet Palace Realm for a few thousands of years. If I\u2019m still unable to break through the restrictions here, then I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to live for long. Luckily, luckily this fellow has appeared!\u201dThe Old Turtle King sighed with emotion as well. \u201cYeah, if it wasn\u2019t for our demon-kind possessing extremely long lifespans, I\u2019m afraid we would have completely been unable to endure the countless years. We must make sure to grab ahold of such a critical moment like this.\u201dThe Nine-tailed Fox King nodded then said abruptly, \u201cRight, do you think he can take the River Diagram?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t the River Diagram, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d His voice came to an abrupt stop, and the Old Turtle King swiftly raised his head and a trace of astonishment was contained within his eyes.The Nine-tailed Fox King was stunned then raised his head to look, and when he saw the thin old man that had appeared suddenly, he couldn\u2019t help but secretly gasp.The old man\u2019s face was thin and indifferent, his eyes deep like an abyss, and he lazily held an azure skinned bottle gourd as he gulped down some wine with an inexplicably unrestrained bearing. He looked to be like a content old man that could be constantly seen in the mortal world.However, how sharp were the gazes of the two demon kings? In practically an instant, they\u2019d noticed a terrifying aura that caused their hearts to palpitate coming from the thin old man.This feeling was like facing a towering mountain of unknown height, only able to look up, only able to revere!Ji Yu swept the two demon kings with his gaze as he said indifferently, \u201cAn old soft-shelled turtle that has cultivated for 31,200 years and a nine-tailed fox that has cultivated for 8,033 years, yet both are only at the perfection-stage of the Violet Palace Realm. If not for your innately long lifespan, the two of you would have probably already transformed into a pile of bones, right?\u201dThe faces of the Old Turtle King and Nine-tailed Fox King went grim and they were unable to restrain a wisp of astonishment from appearing on their faces. Obviously, Ji Yu had revealed everything about the two of them with a single sentence.\u201cThis fellow, Ji Yu, saw through them with a glance?\u201d Although he had known Ji Yu\u2019s cultivation was unfathomable long ago, Chen Xi still couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in surprise.The Old Turtle King\u2019s expression had already become extremely respectful, and he stood up before asking in a respectful tone. \u201cSenior\u2019s eyes are filled with wisdom, may I know Senior\u2019s great name?\u201dThe Nine-tailed Fox King didn\u2019t dare dally and followed to stand up, and the gaze he shot at Ji Yu was filled with shock.\u201cYou two don\u2019t have to know who I am, you just have to answer my questions.\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s voice that seemed to be casual and relaxed had instead revealed an aura of looking down on the world, and he said directly, \u201cIs the River Diagram really in this depths of the mountain range?\u201d\u201cIt is, but it ought to not be the complete River Diagram, and it\u2019s more likely a fragment.\u201d The Old Turtle King replied. He\u2019d already discerned that Ji Yu had a deep relationship with Chen Xi, and he naturally knew what he should do.But a trace of shock couldn\u2019t help but arise in his heart.\u201cA fragment of the River Diagram?\u201d Ji Yu said in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed like that. If it was the complete River Diagram, I\u2019m afraid it would have been discovered long ago.\u201d The Old Turtle King replied extremely straightforwardly.\u201cWhy would the complete River Diagram shatter into fragments? Could it be that another unforeseen event occurred during these one million years of time?\u201d Ji Yu muttered to himself and was lost in thought.Chen Xi instead paid no attention to all this as he said, \u201cSince it\u2019s a fragment of the River Diagram, then why didn\u2019t you two seniors go take it?\u201d\u201cLittle Brother Chen Xi, please don\u2019t address us like this again. I\u2019m unable to take on such respect, let\u2019s just become friends on equal terms.\u201d The Old Turtle King hurriedly corrected.The Nine-tailed Fox king radiated with smiled as he said, \u201cExactly, exactly! If Little Brother Chen Xi doesn\u2019t mind, then just call me as Elder Brother Qing Qiu.\u201dWhen faced with such an unexpected event, Chen Xi\u2019s mind was filled with limitless emotions.\u201cThe energy of the River Diagram fragment is too mystical, and is not something our strengths are able to subdue.\u201d The Old Turtle King\u2019s expression was serious as he said, \u201cAccording to my calculations, only you, Little Brother, are able to subdue it.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Chen Xi pointed at himself in astonishment.\u201cRight, you.\u201d The Old Turtle King spoke with certainty. \u201cI sacrificed 10 years of my lifespan to conduct a divination and devoted myself to try to fathom it. I noticed that all the traces pointed towards you, and it\u2019s absolutely correct.\u201dChen Xi still felt it was extremely absurd, but he also knew that astrological divination and similar secret arts had been present since ancient times, so he didn\u2019t really doubt what the Old Turtle King said.\u201cRegardless of if it\u2019s true or false, go take a look once your strength has recovered.\u201d Ji Yu awoke from his pondering and said decisively, \u201cIf it\u2019s a River Diagram fragment, then the possibility of you seizing it is great indeed. Don\u2019t forget, within your sea of consciousness\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t finish speaking, yet Chen Xi understood what Ji Yu meant. The Fuxi Divine Statue within his sea of consciousness contained a strand of the River Diagram\u2019s true essence, and relying on the faint connection, it was indeed possible for him to subdue the River Diagram fragment.\u201cSenior is correct. Little Brother is probably already exhausted from the fierce battle with the Roc King, and it\u2019s most suitable to go subdue the River Diagram fragment after his strength recovers.\u201d The Old Turtle King was in extremely high spirits, as the appearance of Ji Yu had undoubtedly allowed him to see new hope.\u201cThis is 5,000 kg of spirit liquids for Little Brother Chen Xi to use in recovering your strength. This is an expression of my good will and I hope you don\u2019t refuse.\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King took out a white jade bottle and passed it to Chen Xi.\u201cIt\u2019s better to accept than to decline courteously.\u201d Chen Xi cupped his hand and readily received it.\u201cHahaha!\u201d The Old Turtle King and Nine-tailed Fox King laughed loudly in unison, it seemed that Chen Xi being able to accept this 5,000 kg of spirit liquids caused them to be extremely happy.Chen Xi clearly felt that after he\u2019d accepted this gift, the relationship between himself and the two demon kings had become a great deal closer. It was true that accepting the gifts of others sometimes was instead able to advance the relationship between the two.Of course, Chen Xi didn\u2019t reject this sort of feeling. As far as he was concerned, the Old Turtle King and Nine-tailed Fox King were both experienced demons who had ability, finesse, knew their limits, and knew how to give favors. Establishing a relationship with them was completely beneficial.At the side, Ji Yu watched Chen Xi communicate with the two demon kings. Chen Xi spoke steadily and had a sense of propriety; the greenness in all of his actions had greatly faded away. He\u2019d formed a character and bearing that belonged to himself, and he seemed to be so extraordinary and dignified.\u201cThe little fellow has finally grown up\u2026\u201d Ji Yu sighed with emotion in his heart and was extremely gratified.He still remembered that when he met Chen Xi for the first time, the sedateness and vigilance on that handsome face was like a lonely infant beast that was ready to put his life on the line at any moment; like a hedgehog that had used sharp spikes to disguise himself. It was like if he didn\u2019t do this, then he wouldn\u2019t know how to continue living. He was stubborn, fierce, and steadfast.Comparatively speaking, the current him had already imprinted his ability into his bones, like a rounded cobblestone that released a dazzling light that belonged solely to him.He didn\u2019t need compassion, he didn\u2019t need sympathy, he didn\u2019t need assistance; he would rely on the sword in his heart to do things openly and upright, and repay all kindness and enmity swiftly.This was the mentality that an expert must possess!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 Closed Door CultivationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86 \u2013 Closed Door CultivationWithin the abode on Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.Chen Xi sat cross-legged on the meditation cushion, and beneath the meditation cushion was a segment of a top-grade spirit vein that contained dense spirit energy that cleared the heart and calmed the mind.He took out the Ice Crane Technique\u2019s jade slip and carefully read through it once more.Swoosh!A white jade bottle flew out to descend on the ground before him. The stopper opened up and dense spirit energy suffused out. There was 5,000kg of spirit liquid within. That day, Chen Xi had merely consumed 1,000 kg of spirit liquid and had broken through from the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm to the 1st star of the Violet Palace Realm, moreover, his realm was solid and firm.Chen Xi thought for a moment and withdrew another two jade bottles, one black and one green. They were respectively from the corpses of the Dark Wyrm King and Roc King, and contained respective amounts of almost 4,000kg and 65,000kg of spirit liquid!\u201c65,000kg? Looks like the Roc King didn\u2019t just prepare to refine Bloodsoul Fortune Pills to break through to the Golden Hall Realm, he even prepared sufficient spirit liquid. But it has now benefited me\u2026\u201d Chen Xi roughly took a low breath and was extremely pleasantly surprised in his heart.\u201cDraw!\u201d After arranging the three jade bottles in order, Chen Xi commanded in his heart, and a strand of spirit liquid instantly surged out from within the white jade bottle, then he opened his mouth and swallowed it.Swish! Swish!The rich spirit liquid was like a gurgling stream that washed through the meridians in his entire body, then transformed into a translucent True Essence that was like ice before completely pouring into his Dantian.Within the vast and open space within his violet palace.Along with the influx of strand after strand of True Essence, the great lake that had dried up long ago was like a starving infant beast that started absorbing madly.The surface of the lake rose up bit by bit.After three hours, the great lake in the violet palace had arrived at a saturated condition. The dim star that hung above the great lake in the violet palace emitted a dazzling and resplendent brilliance as well. Its brilliance was chilly like ice and translucent like snow and was extremely beautiful.Rumble!Chen Xi didn\u2019t stop circulating his cultivation technique and instead suddenly started circulating the second level of the Ice Crane Technique, and along with an enormous rumble that was like muffled thunder, the entire great lake in the violet palace started to madly rotate.It rotated like a turbine with a speed that became swifter and swifter, and the absorption force that surged out from it became more and more terrifying. The spirit liquid from within the white jade bottle had practically only just circulated in his meridians for an instant when it was swallowed and absorbed. As a consequence of this, the great lake in the violet palace became more and more wider, more and more deeper!Bang!An enormous bang sounded out, and in the sky above the great lake in the violet palace, another star had abruptly emerged. It was separated on the other side from the previous star, and they both faced each other from a distance. Accompanied by the surging spirit liquids that poured in and the expansion of the great lake in the violet palace, this newly emerged star started becoming gradually brighter from its dim state, then became dazzling, then sparkling!Chen Xi continued absorbing the dense spirit liquid from within the white jade bottle without the slightest intention of stopping.When he advanced to the 2nd star of the Violet Palace Realm, 3,000kg of spirit liquid from the 5,000kg within the white jade bottle was already consumed, and along with Chen Xi\u2019s advancement, the absorption speed of the great lake in his violet palace became faster, causing the mere 2,000kg of spirit liquid that remained in the jade bottle to vanish at an extremely swift speed.Swish! Swish!The great lake in the violet palace continued expanding and deepening at a speed that was at least 10 or even perhaps 100 times faster than before, and this speed was still sustained.Slush!After an unknown amount of time, the spirit liquid within the white jade bottle was completely absorbed. At practically the exact same instant, a spout of spirit liquid flew out from the black jade bottle beside it and poured into Chen Xi\u2019s mouth without the slightest break.Time slowly flowed by.Yet Chen Xi\u2019s eyes were still tightly closed with a peaceful expression on his face, and he still didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of stopping the circulation of his cultivation technique.This wasn\u2019t reckless.After he comprehended a complete Wind Dao Insight, Chen Xi\u2019s soul had already broken through the Perception Force stage and attained the state of Spiritual Perception, and it was on par with cultivators at the Golden Hall Realm.Most importantly, Chen Xi\u2019s current comprehension of the Heaven Dao had long since surpassed cultivators of the same cultivation, and he\u2019d even outdone ordinary Golden Hall Realm cultivators.Relying on the strength of his soul that was at the Spiritual Perception stage and his superb comprehension in Dao Insight, Chen Xi was completely able to cultivate all the way to the Golden Hall Realm without stopping.Of course, the precondition would be to possess sufficient spirit liquid to support his progression.Some cultivators were unable to advance for a long time. On one hand, the reason was possessing insufficient spirit liquid, and on the other hand, it was because their souls weren\u2019t strong enough. \u00a0Without a strong soul to control it, the explosive increase in strength would only lead to exploding to death from the uncontrollable energy.It was like a mortal commoner possessing the True Essence energy to raise a mountain, yet not possessing an equal soul. There would only be one outcome, and the commoner would be unable to control the True Essence and would instead cause himself to die under the bursting and chaotic flow of True Essence.Moreover, the soul was also the central core for controlling Magic Treasures in battle, it was a control level. Even if one\u2019s True Essence was powerful, possessing a weak soul would cause one to be unable to attain the proficient state of controlling a Magic Treasure like controlling one\u2019s arms and finger, so the person\u2019s combat strength would naturally be weak. Even if one\u2019s True Essence was ordinary, possessing a powerful soul would allow one to utilize the full might of a Magic Treasure and the person\u2019s combat strength would rise because of this.All in all, the uses of the soul were extremely profound, and it possessed a mutually beneficial relationship that was inseparable with True Essence, one\u2019s cultivation realm, the comprehension of the Grand Dao, and even crafting talismans, equipment refinement, and beast taming. But, the improvement of the soul was extremely difficult.There were only three ways to cultivate the soul.The first, relying on a visualization technique.The second, relying on comprehending the Grand Dao.The third, tempering the will and spirit through live combat.However, in the cultivation world, visualization techniques were extremely precious and were something only great powers with deep reserves were able to possess. Whereas comprehending the Grand Dao was a fortune that could be encountered by luck but not sought after, and it was extremely difficult.Only the method of using live combat to temper the will remained, yet it was the most ordinary method. However, it was also the most dangerous and slowest method of cultivating the soul.Chen Xi possessed the Fuxi Divine Statue so he naturally didn\u2019t have to consider these questions.When he was at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm, he\u2019d already attained the stage of Perception Force, and in the time after that, his improvement in the comprehension of the Dao was extremely shocking as well. Now that he\u2019d mastered a complete Wind Dao Insight, it was extremely beneficial to his soul, and coupled with his visualization of the Fuxi Divine Statue day in and day out, his soul was even improving at every moment. It wasn\u2019t the slightest bit like other cultivators that would encounter bottlenecks or were unable to advance!Moreover, he\u2019d practically spent this near half a year\u2019s worth of time in battle. No matter if it was combat expertise or the will to fight, they had obtained repeated tempering. The solidness of his Dao Heart and the strength of his will similarly allowed his soul to become even more solid and refined.Visualizing!Comprehending the Dao!Tempering the will via live combat!All of these had placed a dense and powerful foundation for Chen Xi\u2019s soul to strengthen, so it was naturally far from something other cultivators could compare to.\u2026One month had already passed by.During this period of time, Chen Xi was constantly in closed door cultivation. Du Qingxi and the others were recovering from their injuries as well.The Profound-vision Old Turtle King and the Nine-tailed Fox King seemed as if they\u2019d settled down in Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain and stayed within the azure pine forest at the mountainside all day long, drinking tea and wine, merrily living a life of ease.Mu Kui also seized this opportunity to repeatedly consult the two demon kings on questions he had in cultivating. Out of respect for Chen Xi, the two demon kings naturally passed on their knowledge devotedly and guided Mu Kui time after time, causing Mu Kui to be delighted to the point he thought he was dreaming every day and even walking felt as if treading on air.However, Mu Kui soon became troubled because the Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain had suddenly become bustling with activity.\u201cEh, so it\u2019s Fellow Daoist Azure Cow, you\u2019ve come to pay a visit to Senior Chen Xi as well?\u201d\u201cHaha, Old Toad, you\u2019ve actually come as well. I remember that your Lone Jade Mountain is 40,000 km from here. With your cultivation, you ran for at least half a month, right?\u201d\u201cExactly! Aiya! You actually brought Nine-profounds Spiritblend Jade!\u201d\u201cCheh! This gift of mine is still considered to be shabby. Currently, on Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, if you can\u2019t produce a slightly rare treasure, then the loss of face is unendurable!\u201dNear Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, numerous demons carried various gifts and were either in groups of two to five and were like numerous tides of water that were surging up Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain. The scene was extremely bustling with noise and excitement.Since Chen Xi killed the Aqua Cavern\u2019s Black Ape King, the Copper Mountain\u2019s Thunderhawk King, the Moonlight Lake\u2019s Dark Wyrm King and the Moonhowl Ridge\u2019s Roc King, his reputation had become so resounding that he seemed to have become the number one influential figure in the area of 5,000km of the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range.Especially when they heard that the Profound-vision Old Turtle King and the Nine-tailed Fox King had become Chen Xi\u2019s best friends as well, Chen Xi\u2019s reputation was like the sun during high noon, causing the myriad of demons to feel fear and reverence in their hearts.The Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain that Chen Xi stayed at had naturally become the holy grounds within the hearts of the myriad of demons in the depths of the mountain range. It caused countless demons to trudge over to pay their respects, and the grandness of this occasion was unprecedented.\u201cIs Senior Chen Xi still in closed door cultivation?\u201d\u201cYeah, we\u2019ve come here to firstly pay our respects to the two seniors, the Profound-Vision Old Turtle King and the Nine-tailed Fox King, and secondly for the sake of Senior Chen Xi. Fellow Daoist Mu Kui, you mustn\u2019t let all of us down.\u201dEvery day, practically every single demon that walked up Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain would put forward the request of paying their respects to Chen Xi. Mu Kui had been questioned by them to the point calluses were soon to form on his ears, and he repeated the same answer again and again. \u201cSenior Chen Xi is in closed door cultivation.\u201dWhen he was truly forced into a corner, he would turn the spearhead to another place, like saying, \u201cEven I don\u2019t know when Senior Chen Xi will be coming out. Didn\u2019t you see that even the King Xuan Jing and King Qing Qiu are waiting? Why don\u2019t all of you go ask the two Kings?\u201dEven then, Mu Kui had still become extremely busy. He had to engage in social small talk with the various fellow daoists, then make a feast for them to eat and enjoy themselves. In the end, after he\u2019d sent them off, he still had to carry the various gifts. He was running off his feet all day and it caused him to feel dizzy.Mu Kui\u2019s vexations were greatly relieved after the Nine-tailed Fox King arranged for over 100 beautiful fox demons under his command to become attendants.After Mu Kui sat cross-legged at the table at the mountainside azure pine forest, he drank fine wine as he muttered. The nearby open space that was over 3km large was crowded with various demons since long ago. Some had just arrived, some had stayed here for many days, and they were all waiting to meet Chen Xi.\u201cI never expected that Chen Xi was so well received,\u201d Duanmu Ze said in admiration.\u201cHaha, I think so too, he seems like a mountain king. But the monkey wine here is really delicious.\u201d Song Lin\u2019s sleepy eyes were half closed as he embraced the wine jug and spoke vaguely.Du Qingxi didn\u2019t speak, but she was extremely delighted in her heart. As for the reason, even she was unable to say. She was a woman after all, and they would always have delighted moments or worries that were inexplicable.Rumble!It was at this moment that the door of the abode that had been closed tightly for a month opened up slowly.Swoosh!At this moment, all the sounds vanished without a trace, and within this sudden silence, the gazes of everyone shot within the abode in unison.Their expressions contained undisguisable excitement and anticipation, and they seemed to be afraid to even breathe heavily.It was under this attention of the multitude of demons that a tall figure slowly walked out from within the abode.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 Element Inversion MountainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87 \u2013 Element Inversion MountainA handsome appearance, tall figure, and a steady and dignified bearing; when they saw this youth, the innumerable demons that had been waiting outside for a long time stood up with a \u2018swish\u2019 in unison before bowing in greeting. Their movements were neat and uniform, as if they were an army that had drilled for a long time.There were no sounds of congratulations nor uproarious sounds. It was just a silent and respectful rise and bow, yet it possessed more strength than any words, as this was reverence and submission that came from within.The most beautiful sound was silence, as it went straight to the heart!This was the most grandiose scene that had happened in the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range for countless years. A myriad of demons paying their respects was an unprecedentedly dazzling scene.The myriad of demons stood respectfully as if they were facing the general on the battlefield that was calling roll, as if they were subjects that were paying their respects to the king. This scene caused Du Qingxi and the others to fall into boundless shock.Chen Xi was stunned for a moment, then as he gazed into the distance at the dense crowd of demons that he could see no end of and looked at the submission and reverence in their expressions, his heart was shocked as well.\u201cDemon-kind have always been more straightforward than humans. They believed in their fists and believed in strength, and possessed adoration and fanaticism that others were unable to understand towards the strong. You\u2019ve killed four of the seven demon kings, and your reputation is influential like the sun hanging in the sky. I have no doubt that if you dare make yourself king, these demon-kind would instantly commit themselves under your command, and they would follow by your side and never refuse any command of yours.\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s voice sounded out in his heart.\u201cAlright, your wishes have been granted, quickly leave now. Don\u2019t disturb the quiet cultivation of me and Little Brother Chen Xi.\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King flew into midair, and his voice was like exploding thunder that rumbled as it sounded out throughout Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.The Nine-tailed Fox King had spoken personally, and there was naturally no demon that dared disobey him.In next to no time, the crowd of demons were like tidewater as they poured down Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain. Even though they didn\u2019t have the chance to speak with Chen Xi, they were already satisfied after seeing Chen Xi\u2019s appearance. They felt that their trip here wasn\u2019t for nothing.\u201cYou\u2019ve advanced?\u201d Not long after the masses of demons had left, the Nine-tailed Fox King glanced over thoughtlessly and noticed to his surprise that Chen Xi seemed as if he\u2019d been reborn. Although the aura surrounding Chen Xi\u2019s body had become more and more faint, he naturally possessed an extraordinary and elegant bearing as he casually stood there, like a towering mountain that held its spirit within.Chen Xi nodded. It wasn\u2019t just an advancement, during his month long closed door cultivation, he\u2019d already completely absorbed all the spirit liquid he\u2019d obtained. Now, within the space in his violet palace, five dazzling and resplendent stars hung there, fluttering as they emitted rays of starlight and coordinated with each other from a distance, and the True Essence that was glittering and translucent like ice within the great lake in his violet palace was vast and mighty,If it wasn\u2019t for the spirit liquid being insufficient, Chen Xi would have been able to break through to the Golden Hall Realm in one go!Most importantly, the cultivation of the Ice Crane Technique caused the great lake in Chen Xi\u2019s violet palace to be even wider and deeper than an ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivator. Although the accumulated True Essence was extremely thick, the amount of spirit liquid consumed to advance a level was many times more than an ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivator.If Chen Xi wanted to advance to the 6th star of the Violet Palace Realm, then he would probably require 50,000kg of spirit liquid.Advancing to the 7th star of the Violet Palace Realm would require 100,000kg of spirit liquid.Advancing to the 8th star of the Violet Palace Realm would require 200,000kg of spirit liquid.\u2026Without one million kg of spirit liquid as a base, breaking through to the Golden Hall Realm was utterly impossible!Of course, with Chen Xi\u2019s current strength, he was already completely unafraid of cultivators at the perfection-stage of the Violet Palace Realm. Even if he were to surpass a realm and battle a Golden Hall Realm cultivator, there was still a possibility for him to annihilate his opponent.After all, no one could possibly be like him, having a soul that improved at every moment, possessing natural talent in comprehending the Dao that was abnormal to the point it was heaven defying, and cultivating a treasured cultivation technique, the Ice Crane Technique\u2026 He was simply an existence that was a living monster.If he were to advance his body refinement cultivation to the Violet Palace Realm as well, then condense shaman markings and control Shaman Energy, Chen Xi\u2019s combat strength would even be able to surge up a great deal!Unfortunately, the advancement of the School of Fiendgod Body Refinement was too slow. Even though he possessed the extremely formidable body refinement cultivation technique, the Universe Starslayer Bodyforging Arts, he was still stuck at the edge of the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm and was unable to break through for a long time.According to Ji Yu, the Violet Palace Realm of body refinement allowed the condensation of shaman markings that could convert Shaman Energy. It was a formidable realm that allowed one to control unbelievable Divine Abilities! How could it be so easily achieved?Taking this step forward meant being in the middle of mortals and the divine, it was a qualitative transformation, like a caterpillar breaking through the cocoon to become a beautiful and dancing butterfly!But this step was like a wide chasm. Without the bitter cultivation and accumulation at the early period and the tempering of the body all day and night, the strand of a chance to break through that seemed illusory. It was utterly impossible to touch the edge of the Violet Palace Realm.\u201cChen Xi, when will we be leaving here?\u201d Du Qingxi walked over and asked in a light voice. After she\u2019d seen the scene of the myriad of demons coming to pay their respects, she couldn\u2019t help but be slightly worried that Chen Xi would be unwilling to leave this place.\u201cYeah, a year has already passed since we entered the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain. Now that we\u2019ve gotten out of the predicament again, we naturally ought to swiftly leave this place. This way, our families wouldn\u2019t be worried.\u201d Duanmu Ze spoke as well.Actually, Chen Xi couldn\u2019t wait to leave this place as well, but he still had something to do, and he said, \u201cWe can depart once I finish dealing with a matter with the two demon kings.\u201d\u201cPrecisely. If this matter doesn\u2019t succeed then I\u2019m afraid all of you will be unable to leave,\u201d The Old Turtle King said with a smile on his face.The face of Du Qingxi and the others went grim.\u201cEveryone, you\u2019ve misunderstood. How should I say it? The matter that we and Little Brother Chen Xi are going to deal with is precisely to open up a path that leads to the outside world. Without this path, then not to mention all of you, even we are unable to leave.\u201d The Old Turtle King vaguely explained and didn\u2019t breathe a word about the River Diagram fragment.\u201cYes, it\u2019s indeed so.\u201d Chen Xi nodded.Only now did everyone heave a sigh of relief.\u201cThen be careful and return quickly.\u201d Du Qingxi suddenly rose her head and looked straight into Chen Xi\u2019s eyes as she spoke, and her voice that was cold like ice emitted a wisp of rare embarrassment and gentleness.\u2026Hu!Chen Xi inexplicably heaved a sigh of relief after sitting on the treasured vessel and flying out of Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain for a long time.When he recalled the words Du Qingxi spoke earlier, a strand of strange throbbing still remained within his heart, and it was like he\u2019d touched electricity, causing him to be taken by surprise, yet he was extremely fond of it.This feeling was like tasting strong wines, like listening to wonderful music, and it was truly difficult to depict it.\u201cBased on Little Brother Chen Xi\u2019s appearance, could it be that you\u2019re troubled about love? No wonder Little Brother went alone and depended on the sword in your hand to kill your way up Moonhowl Ridge. So it turns out that it was urged by the affection of getting enraged for your woman, a truly enviable pair of Dao Companions.\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King blinked his charming peach shaped eyes as he teased.Chen Xi was stymied, then he hurriedly shook his head and changed the topic as he didn\u2019t want to explore the private affairs in his heart with a sly old fox.\u201cRight, where exactly is the River Diagram fragment?\u201dThe Nine-tailed Fox King smiled and didn\u2019t overdo it. He leaned on the railing and looked into the distance as he spoke in an unhurried manner. \u201cIt\u2019s naturally at the center of this place, under the Element Inversion Mountain 25,000 km from here.\u201dA trace of anticipation couldn\u2019t help but emerge in Chen Xi\u2019s heart.Swoosh!The treasure vessel broke through the roiling waves of clouds as it flew swiftly below the sky. Although its speed couldn\u2019t compare to a flying sword, one didn\u2019t have to expend True Essence when staying within it and it was also able to keep out the wind and rain and avoid the atmospheric winds in the sky, it was extremely comfortable and convenient.In next to no time, a pitch-black mountain that pierced straight into the clouds was reflected in their eyes. This mountain was barren and filled with jagged rocks of strange shapes, like a steel fierce beast, and within an area of 50km from it, it was actually completely deathly quiet without a trace of life in the slightest!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88 Profound Disruption MountainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88 \u2013 Profound Disruption MountainThe surroundings were filled with vitality like green hills and blue rivers, vast expanses of cloud and mist, and various birds; yet near the pitch-black and precipitous mountain, violent winds raged, gravel flew about all over the sky, and howling sounds filled the air. It was a like a deathly still den of monsters that emitted ghastly wails and wolf howls.Two completely different scenes gathered in one place and separated quite distinctly from one another, it was extremely bizarre!Swoosh!The treasured vessel stopped 50km away.\u201cLook.\u201d The Old Turtle King pointed at the pitch-black mountain. \u201cThat\u2019s the Element Inversion Mountain. The elements are inverted there, and neither man nor beast can live within. Even if it's cultivators like us, mistakenly entering it would cause the blood to flow in opposite direction from the heart and the True Essence will become chaotic. The longer the person stays within the range of the Element Inversion Mountain, the easier it is for one\u2019s energy to become chaotic and explode from the chaotic energy.\u201dHow strong was Chen Xi\u2019s soul? The instant his soul swept past the vicinity of the pitch-black mountain, he\u2019d acutely noticed a type of fluctuation that was like tidewater, and it was gloomy, mysterious, and heavy\u2026 It seemed to contain an energy that crushed all life, causing one\u2019s heart to involuntarily start palpitating and feel astonished.\u201cIt\u2019s extremely terrifying indeed.\u201d Chen Xi nodded then asked. \u201cThe River Diagram\u2019s fragment is beneath the mountain?\u201d\u201cExactly. According to my ancestors, the Element Inversion Mountain utterly didn\u2019t exist in the past and instead appeared with the River Diagram\u2019s fragment one million years ago. So the River Diagram\u2019s fragment is surely concealed within it.\u201d The Old Turtle King answered. \u201cMoreover, according to my deduction, the peculiar fluctuation formed by the Element Inversion Mountain is also capable of properly concealing the River Diagram\u2019s aura. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid it would have been discovered by almighty cultivators who possessed extraordinary powers long ago.\u201d\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Chen Xi was slightly unable to wait. Even if it was a fragment, so long as it touched the words \u2018River Diagram,\u2019 it still possessed supreme temptation.As the saying goes, money and treasures move the heart, and the temptation was precisely because of this principle.\u201cThere\u2019s no other way, we can only walk in.\u201d The Old Turtle King spread out his hands with a bitter smile on his face. \u201cAll treasures will disintegrate within the area covered by the Element Inversion Mountain due to the inversion of energy. So, we can\u2019t use this treasured vessel any longer. As for the location of the River Diagram fragment, it\u2019s at the center beneath the Element Inversion Mountain.\u201dAs he spoke up to here, the Old Turtle King had a serious expression when he turned around. \u201cOnce we arrive close to the Element Inversion Mountain, the strength of me and Qing Qiu will be restrained greatly, and I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll be unable to help Little Brother. Little Brother, you\u2019ll have to depend on yourself if you want to take out the River Diagram fragment.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Wealth is sought from danger and risk. It was naturally impossible for him to obtain the River Diagram fragment so easily, and these were all within Chen Xi\u2019s expectations.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Chen Xi was the first to leap off the treasured vessel. The instant his feet stepped onto the barren area, he felt his entire body shake and the gloomy, mysterious, and heavy fluctuation assaulted his face. The True Essence within his violet palace seemed to be stimulated as it started becoming restless, and the blood within his entire body became unruly and wanted to flow in inverse.Chen Xi hurriedly circulated his cultivation technique, and only then was he able to suppress it as his expression was already extremely grim.Wu~ Wu~The strong winds raged, wailing and howling as if the god of ghosts was weeping, and it was extremely grating on the ear. But to Chen Xi who\u2019d comprehended a complete Wind Dao Insight, these winds were nothing.The instant those ferocious violent winds touched the surroundings of his body, it was as if they\u2019d encountered their king and obediently kept out of his way, not daring to offend his supreme majesty.Even then, Chen Xi\u2019s movement was still extremely strenuous because along with his steps entering deep into the area, the bizarre fluctuating energy became stronger, and wave after wave, it swept past his body like a tidal wave, like devils that seized and absorbed the soul, wishing for nothing more than to cause the blood and True Essence within Chen Xi\u2019s body to explode.The Old Turtle King and Nine-tailed Fox King followed closely behind. Although they didn\u2019t have treasures to protect their bodies, they received Chen Xi\u2019s protection. Those violent winds were unable to touch their bodies as well, causing the two demon kings to endlessly praise in their hearts, and they gazed at Chen Xi\u2019s back with gazes that were filled with anticipation.Huff! Huff! Huff!After the time for an incense stick to burn, when they were 330m away from the Element Inversion Mountain, the two demon kings were unable to take a step further, their breathing was heavy and rapid and their expressions were extremely ghastly pale and unsightly. Obviously, that shapeless and bizarre fluctuation had caused immeasurable pressure to the two of them.Chen Xi\u2019s expression was normal, as his Dao Heart was solid and condensed like a stone on the shore, and even his soul had attained the level of Spiritual Perception. He was able to excellently control the activity of his body, and although the bizarre fluctuation grew stronger and stronger, it was still within the scope that he could endure.\u201cLittle Brother Chen Xi, I and Qing Qiu can only accompany you up to here, the remainder will all be up to you.\u201d The Old Turtle King breathed heavily as he spoke.\u201cYou must succeed, we\u2019ll be waiting for your triumphant return.\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King stared at Chen Xi\u2019s eyes as he spoke word by word.\u201cOkay!\u201d Chen Xi nodded, and he didn\u2019t say anything further before once again walking forward.\u201cCan he do it?\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King gazed at Chen Xi who gradually vanished in the distance, and mind was filled with worry about his future as he muttered. \u201cIf even he fails, then I can only wait for death to arrive.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t speak such dispirited words, have you forgotten that there\u2019s still a mysterious and formidable senior by Little Brother Chen Xi\u2019s side?\u201d The Old Turtle King said in a deep voice, \u201cHe\u2019ll surely succeed. So long as he takes out the River Diagram fragment, the restraint that envelops the depth of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range will surely be broken. You and I will surely be able to charge into the Golden Hall Realm, and we won\u2019t have to worry about our lifespans reaching the limit and dying with regret.\u201d\u2026\u201cDammit! Exactly what energy is this? It\u2019s so strange.\u201d The more he walked the more strenuous it became for Chen Xi, and he had to devote all his strength to control the activity within his body. If he were to slack slightly, the blood and True Essence within his body would become chaotic and start rampaging, and the consequences were unimaginable.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t advance to the 5th star of the Violet Palace Realm, I\u2019m afraid that at this moment, I would have died from my blood surging in reverse and my True Essence becoming chaotic. No wonder the 330m around the Element Inversion Mountain is devoid of any life.\u201dChen Xi had to stop and rest slightly at a distance of 100m away from the Element Inversion Mountain. All along the way here, not only had he expended a large amount of True Essence to resist the bizarre fluctuation, even his mind was extremely exhausted from it. At this moment, as he gazed at the Element Inversion Mountain that was close at hand, he felt extremely fearful of his journey so far.\u201cThe energy in this world is truly marvelous, inverting the elements\u2026 There\u2019s even such energy in this world. If I\u2019m able to use this type of energy to refine a Magic Treasure, then I presume its might will surely be extremely terrifying, right?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Right when Chen Xi was lost in thoughts, Ji Yu had his hands behind his back as he leisurely appeared by Chen Xi\u2019s side, and as he looked up at the dangerously steep mountain that was 33km tall, extraordinary splendor rippled within his eyes.\u201cExactly what energy is atop this Element Inversion Mountain? And how do I refine it into a Magic Treasure?\u201d Chen Xi asked in wonder.Ji Yu was stunned. \u201cThis is undoubtedly a Profound Disruption Mountain, how could it be an Element Inversion Mountain?\u201dThis time, it was instead Chen Xi who was stunned. \u201cProfound Disruption Mountain?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s naturally a Profound Disruption mountain, and it possesses Profound Disruption Divinelight. A granule sized dot is beyond 150,000kg in weight, and innately restrains the essence of the five elements. During the primordial era, this Profound Disruption Mountain was also an extremely rare precious material for equipment refinement, and the Profound Disruption Divinelight within it was even able to be used to cultivate a Divine Ability called Wings of Disruption. Not only can this Divine Ability tear through space to instantly move an extremely great distance, a light flap of the wings was able to cause any Magic Treasure of the five elements to lose its capabilities and transform into a ball of scrap!\u201d\u201cIn terms of might, it isn\u2019t the slightest bit inferior to the Fivecolored Divinelight that is ranked in the top 10 during the primordial era.\u201d\u201cAs for the Element Inversion Mountain, it really does exist. The so-called Element Inversion Mountain is an extremely mystical mountain that caused fresh air to sink, foul air to rise, overturned the heaven and the earth, and made energy circulate in reverse. However, it was refined into a Magic Treasure by an almighty cultivator figure a million years ago, and it\u2019s impossible for a second Element Inversion Mountain to appear in the world.\u201d Ji Yu gazed at the Profound Disruption Mountain with a burning gaze, and he spoke extremely swiftly with a voice that revealed a trace of reminiscence and emotion.Chen Xi\u2019s mind rose and fell like the tide as he heard this, and boundless yearning emerged within his heart.\u201cDo you want to keep this Profound Disruption Mountain?\u201d asked Ji Yu abruptly.\u201cYes!\u201d Chen Xi didn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest with his answer. A granule sized piece of this divine thing was over 150,000kg in weight, and it even contained Profound Disruption Divinelight within it that\u2019s able to be used to cultivate the Wings of Disruption. How could he let it slip by?Of course, he knew that it was utterly impossible to keep it away by relying solely on his current strength. After all, this was a mountain that was 33km tall, and to what extent would its weight have reached? 10 million tons? 100 million tons? It was immeasurable!Thus, when he heard that Ji Yu was able to assist him in keeping away this Profound Disruption Mountain, the wild joy in Chen Xi\u2019s heart could be easily imagined.\u201cI can only help you drag it into the Manor, moreover\u2026\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s expression suddenly became extremely serious, and he stared fixedly at Chen Xi\u2019s gaze as he said slowly, \u201cMoreover, because of expending too much of my strength, I will have to stay dormant inside the Manor in the future, and I\u2019ll be unable to help you anymore for an extremely long period of time.\u201dChen Xi was stunned, and he was silent for a long time before saying resolutely. \u201cThen it\u2019s fine if I don\u2019t have this Profound Disruption Mountain!\u201dJi Yu laughed loudly, and his hearty laughter was filled with joy as he said, \u201cKid, your heart isn\u2019t bad. Even if you don\u2019t want this Profound Disruption Mountain, I would still help you keep it away!\u201cThere\u2019s no need to say more.\u201d\u201cYou have to know that after you pass through the 1st level of the Heavenpeak of Trials, I won\u2019t be able to leave the Manor and assist you any longer, and this is something that would happen sooner or later. Instead of that, why don\u2019t I seize the opportunity to help you now and put away this Profound Disruption Mountain? This is the best choice.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Chen Xi recalled the bits and pieces from the past, he recalled the guidance and teaching Ji Yu gave him, and a strand of dense reluctance surged out from his heart. Because since a long time ago, deep within his heart, he\u2019d taken Ji Yu to be an elder family member, a loved one.\u201cDon\u2019t be fussy. Once you have the strength to pass through the Heavenpeak of Trials, you\u2019ll be able to enter the Manor and see me every day. It isn\u2019t a final farewell, so why be so irresolute and hesitant?\u201d Ji Yu frowned as he berated.\u201cReally?\u201d Chen Xi said in pleasant surprise.Ji Yu smiled helplessly. \u201cIt\u2019s naturally true. I\u2019m only unable to leave the Manor. Kid, why are you like a little child?\u201dHowever, Ji Yu also knew that when Chen Xi was young, Chen Xi\u2019s clan was annihilated, his parents went missing, the grandfather he shared his life together with had died miserably in the hands of his enemies, and only his younger brother remained, but his young brother had gone to the Wandering Cloud Sword Sect to practice his swordsmanship as well. Comparatively speaking, Chen Xi cherished the familial relationships in his life more than anyone, and even the future friendships, love relationships, relationships between master and disciple\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s fine if it\u2019s like this.\u201d Chen Xi decided inwardly that he would surely break through his body refinement cultivation to the Violet Palace Realm as soon as possible. In this way, he would possess the qualifications to challenge the 1st level of the Heavenpeak of Trials and would be able to see Senior Ji Yu every day in the future.\u201cProfound Disruption Mountain\u2026 Haha! It\u2019s been a million years, I\u2019ve nearly forgotten the taste of battle!\u201d Ji Yu suddenly let out a long howl towards the sky, his voice surging like thunder, and rumbling exploded out throughout the heaven and earth. Whereas his body had instead arrived below the sky. Roiling multicolored divine lights appeared on his entire body and he\u2019d already changed in appearance in an instant.A body of a lion and head of a dragon, he stepped on clouds with four hooves that were thick like pillars, and his entire body was covered dense inky black scaled. His body was like a small hill with boundless and majestic rays of light that were unparalleled flowing around his entire body. He stood proudly at the top of the cloud as he looked down at the world!Rumble!The heavens and earth seemed to tremble, and the space within an area of 500km was violently roiling. For a time, spirit energy was chaotic and raging, the plants were blazed into ash and the ground was pressured to the point it cracked and collapsed, leaving behind numerous enormous ravines that crisscrossed each other.Thump! Thump! Thump!Chen Xi felt suffocated. It was like a majestic large mountain pressed onto his entire body, pressing him to the point he retreated repeatedly and the vital energy and blood in his chest violently roiled without end.\u201cSo\u2026 So terrifying!\u201d Chen Xi gasped, and as he gazed at the enormous silhouettes of a beast under the sky, he felt himself to be like an ant that would die with a single stomp and possessed no room to struggle in the slightest!Chen Xi was unable to guess, but he was extremely certain that the current Ji Yu was the most terrifying existence he\u2019d ever seen; there was no other!\u201cHeaven and earth as the guide, the world as the fuel, the stars in the universe\u2026\u201d A wave of obscure and mysterious chanting and incantations sounded out. It was powerful and mighty, and every word seemed like a thunderclap that shook the heavens and the earth, seeming to want to make everything to prostrate itself in obedience.Ji Yu\u2019s hoof abruptly stepped on the sky, and his mouth opened as he suddenly emitted a roar that was like a dragon\u2019s roar. \u201cSeal!\u201dA single word, yet it seemed to contain the profundity of the Grand Dao and the mysteries of the cycle of heaven. It was like a sacred Sanskrit chant that came from ancient times, and it was even more alike to a shout that shook the soul the most towards life and death, the world, and the heaven and earth!Chen Xi felt his entire body shake and he almost knelt down and lay flat on the floor, his soul and will seeming to have suffered a beating from the shapeless energy of the heaven and earth.Rumble!The 33km tall Profound Disruption Mountain suddenly started to sway violently, seeming as if it would be pulled up by the root in the next moment. However, right at this moment, a heavy, gloomy, and mysterious energy gushed out, roiling as it formed into a pitch-black luster that caused one\u2019s heart to palpitate in fear, and it swept out towards Ji Yu who was beneath the sky.Shockingly, it was the Profound Disruption Mountain\u2019s luster that was able to incinerate the essence of the five elements!\u201cYou still dare resist!?\u201d Ji Yu who possessed a lion\u2019s body and a dragon\u2019s head abruptly emitted an explosive shout, his voice was like thunder that exploded out to cause the Profound Disruption Mountain\u2019s pitch-black luster to break inch by inch before collapsing and vanishing.\u201cSwallow!\u201d An enormous entrance that was an entire 3km in area appeared out of thin air, and it was like the eye of a storm as it fiercely swallowed the Profound Disruption Mountain.However, Chen Xi saw that the entire Profound Disruption Mountain that was 33km tall was like a rootless piece of straw that flew into midair before flying into the enormous entrance to disappear within the blink of an eye.Swish!The entrance in the sky instantly vanished as well.Swoosh!It was at this moment that a wisp of extremely dazzling colorful brilliance swiftly stormed out from the enormous empty space where the Profound Disruption Mountain had vanished, and it swiftly flashed towards the extremely distant skies.\u201cCatch it properly!\u201d Ji Yu emitted another explosive shout that was like muffled thunder, and two golden flowing lights shot out explosively from his eyes. The instant the two golden lights appeared in midair, they transformed into two bright gold enormous golden palms that instantly caught that dazzling colorful brilliance and fiercely tossed it towards Chen Xi who was on the ground.Chen Xi swiftly raised his head, and cold lights flowed within his eyes as the aura on his entire body climbed steadily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 Leaving For HomePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 89 \u2013 Leaving For HomeWhoosh!The instant Chen Xi\u2019s hand caught the dazzling brilliance, a strange energy that was a mix of scorching hot and icy coldness disregarded the thick True Essence covering his palm as it fiercely pierced into his flesh like a sharp awl, seeming to want to break open his palm and escape.\u201cIt actually disregarded the energy of my True Essence!\u201d Chen Xi felt pain to the point that his face warped. If it wasn\u2019t for him cultivating the Universe Starslayer Bodyforging Arts and having already tempered his body to the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm, only this blow would have caused a hole to be pierced through his palm.At this moment, Chen Xi finally saw clearly that the dazzling brilliance in his palm was actually like an irregular fragment of a tortoise shell.It was palm-sized, entirely rough and pitch-black, with crisscrossed rugged markings that were dense and complicated cut on its surface. Yet not only was it not in disorder, it instead carried along an ancient and profound aura.It seemed like within it was a boundless ocean, a star studded sky, a heaven and earth that was vast like when the world was formed. Up to the heavens and down to the netherworld, it was vast without end. With a glance, it seemed as if it wanted to absorb one\u2019s soul into it!Chen Xi was inexplicably shocked. That instant earlier, his soul seemed as if it wanted to fly away, and it caused him to feel great terror and great panic.Om!It was at this moment that a strand of a violent torrent of energy surged out from the River Diagram fragment into his palm once again. It was like the lava from the core of the earth and extremely cold ice mixed together, so scorching that it scalded his skin and so icy cold that it pierced his bones. With a bang, it shook Chen Xi\u2019s hand to the point a spray of blood exploded out from his tightly clenched right hand, and the blood spattered and suffused into the air, revealing ghastly white bones on his hand.\u201cAh!\u201d The intense pain caused Chen Xi to be unable to refrain from roaring out, yet his hand still tightly clenched onto the River Diagram fragment without letting go. Even if his skin and flesh had already opened up and white bones clanked.Chen Xi didn\u2019t notice that after the River Diagram fragment was tainted with his blood, it struggled even more intensely. It was restless and uneasy, seeming to have noticed that an energy that caused it to feel extreme terror was silently approaching\u2026Om!Another strand of scorching and icy cold energy that were mixed together surged out once again, and right when Chen Xi intended to exert all the strength in his body and grit his teeth to endure this wave of pain, the ancient divine statue that sat cross-legged in his sea of consciousness suddenly opened its eyes. In that instant, it was like the primordial world was just opened up and the universe was just formed, there seemed to be lightning coiling and stars revolving within its eyes, and a myriad of scenes and divine lights diffused out with a bang.\u201cGather!\u201d It was like the shout of an ancient god, like a divine statue that existed eternally had moved, an arm extended out to the air and lightly made a grabbing motion like it was embracing the world and the universe, and the arms fingers tore through the sky, splitting open numerous black rifts!Om!The River Diagram fragment suddenly trembled intensely in Chen Xi\u2019s hand, seeming to be unwilling, seeming to be struggling, but in the end, it all proved futile and it vanished in the blink of an eye.Within the space in Chen Xi\u2019s sea of consciousness that seemed to have no end.A dazzling brilliance suddenly appeared, then it revealed a palm-sized tortoise shell that went round and round around the Fuxi Divine Statue, fluttering about ceaselessly.\u201cLooks like it was the strand of River Diagram true essence within the Fuxi Divine Statue that was activated and made it completely submit.\u201d Chen Xi withdrew his gaze from his sea of consciousness, and only now did he heave out a long breath of air.Hiss!At the instant his mind relaxed, an intense pain that felt like his heart was pierced by ten thousand arrows spread throughout his body, and only now did he realize that only ghastly white bones remained on his right hand.\u201cI\u2019m only at the perfection-stage of the Congenital Realm in body refinement now and am unable to regrow my limbs like a Violet Palace Realm cultivation would allow me to. What should I do?\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s heart tensed up, and when he recalled his younger brother who\u2019d similarly lost his right hand. For a time, all sort of feelings surged into his heart.Swish!A wisp of cool and refreshing airflow poured into his right palm that was only bones, the flesh, tendons, and skin quickly grew like a dried tree meeting spring, and it healed to its prior state at a visible speed.It was Ji Yu. He\u2019d already recovered his thin appearance. With a swing of his sleeve, he\u2019d already healed Chen Xi\u2019s right hand, and it was extremely miraculous.However, Chen Xi was instead startled when he saw Ji Yu\u2019s countenance.Ji Yu was ghastly pale to the point he was almost translucent. His gaze was dim like a waning candlelight that was about to go out, and even his tall figure seemed to become blurred, as if it would collapse and vanish in the next moment.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry, it\u2019s only because my strength has been completely expended.\u201d Ji Yu\u2019s voice was hoarse and low, and it emitted dense exhaustion.Chen Xi\u2019s heart ached.Ji Yu smiled, yet his smile was like a withered chrysanthemum as he said, \u201cI\u2019ve already absorbed the Profound Disruption Mountain into the abode, and I\u2019ll teach you how to bind it once your strength becomes greater. As for the River Diagram fragment, I presume you have already assimilated it into your sea of consciousness. Don\u2019t go try to comprehend it first, as things comprehended from a broken thing are always the most inferior.\u201d\u201cI remember that the complete River Diagram is the size of a cattail leaf fan, I reckon there\u2019s still another eight or nine River Diagram fragments abandoned in other places, and you must collect it completely. All those years ago, Master relied on it to comprehend the Dao of the cycle of the heavens, and walked to the limit of the Grand Dao in the end. I hope that you are able to comprehend a Dao that belongs to yourself.\u201d\u201cBesides that, take proper care of yourself in the future. A man must always learn to face and endure things alone, as only then can you be called a true expert. Mmm, all this is too long winded, we can still frequently see each other once you pass the Heavenpeak of Trails, there\u2019s no need to mention these garrulous words\u2026\u201dChen Xi silently listened, and the past scenes of happiness, inspiration, joy, and depression\u2026 They seemed like flowing water as they swept past his mind, they were so clear yet so far, and his tears couldn\u2019t be restrained anymore and silently slid down his face.Even if he knew that he could see Ji Yu in the future, Chen Xi was unable to control the feelings in his heart. He wasn\u2019t good at expressing himself and had held back for too long, and he'd never said a single thank you to Ji Yu all along\u2026 All the gratitude and emotions in his heart gushed out at this moment like lava erupting from a volcano.He cried, cried silently, cried willfully.At this moment, Chen Xi was like a 16 year old youth, venting his gratitude and pain without any scruples.\u2026Ji Yu had already vanished since an unknown time, yet Chen Xi still stood on the spot in a daze, like a log.After a long time, he muttered. \u201cI surely will, surely.\u201d It was like a vow, and his calm and slow voice revealed a resolute and decisive feeling within it.\u201cWhat happened earlier?\u201d\u201cMy god! The Element Inversion Mountain vanished!\u201d\u201cLook, Little Brother Chen Xi is there.\u201dA wave of conversation vaguely sounded out from the distance, then two flying lights tore through the sky towards him. It was the Old Turtle King and Nine-tailed Fox King.Chen Xi turned around and the traces of tears on his face had evaporated off, and he\u2019d recovered his indifferent and carefree expression as he said, \u201cI was fortunate enough to succeed in my mission.\u201dIt was a mere few words, yet when it entered the ears of the Old Turtle King and the Nine-tailed Fox King, it was instead an enormously pleasant surprise. Actually, the two of them had noticed some changes since long ago, but only when they obtained Chen Xi\u2019s confirmation did they dare believe that all this was real.\u201cSo to say, the restraint that enveloped the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range for a million years has vanished?\u201d The Old Turtle King\u2019s voice trembled slightly.\u201cHAHAHA! I never expected that when my lifespan was about to be over, I would be able to once again obtain the hope of breaking through to the next realm. The heavens didn\u2019t betray me!\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King laughed loudly at the sky, seeming to be venting the excitement and joy in his heart.Chen Xi silently watched this, yet he was still thinking about Ji Yu in his heart.Chen Xi\u2019s unusualness was noticed by the Old Turtle King, and he thought in his heart before slowly saying with a solemn expression. \u201cI establish a vow beneath the Heaven Dao, that if I were to leak the matter of the River Diagram fragment in my entire lifetime, then I request the Heaven Dao to punish me. Annihilate me and make me unable to be reborn forever!\u201dThe Old Turtle King couldn\u2019t be blamed for doing this, as the River Diagram fragment was something that could cause an upheaval in the three dimensions, after all. It was a rare treasure that primordial beings fought over chaotically. Now that a portion of it was obtained by Chen Xi, if this matter were to leak out, then not only would it draw a deathly calamity to Chen Xi, it would probably even cause him to be affected, and the consequences were unimaginable.Establishing a vow under the Heaven Dao was naturally extremely beneficial without a single disadvantage.The Nine-tailed Fox King was stunned, then he recovered from his shock and faced the vast Heaven Dao as he established a similar vow under the Heaven Dao.Chen Xi never imagined that his silence would actually solve a great trouble that was latent and imperceptible, and his mood became much happier as he said with cupped hands, \u201cThank you Big Brothers for such trust, Chen Xi is boundlessly grateful.\u201dThe two demon kings looked at each other and smiled when they heard this.Swoosh!The treasured vessel rose into the air and swiftly flew towards Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain.\u201cHave you really decided to leave today, and you\u2019re not staying for a few days?\u201d The Old Turtle King persuaded Chen Xi to stay once again. Since he\u2019d ascended the vessel, Chen Xi had already decided that once they returned to Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, he would leave the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range and return to Pine Mist City. The Old Turtle King was naturally reluctant, as he still wanted to properly entertain Chen Xi for some time.\u201cYeah, why are you in such a hurry? I still want to bring you to Coldstar Mountain and help you choose the most beautiful fox in my Nine-tailed Fox family.\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King ceaselessly persuaded him to stay as well.\u201cI still have many things to do, and I really don\u2019t have the time to stay. Big Brothers, please let me off.\u201d Chen Xi leaned on the railings and looked into the distance as he spoke slowly with an extremely resolute attitude. At this moment, he recalled the various past events in Pine Mist City, he recalled his family, recalled Uncle Zhang from the Zhang grocery store, recalled the Clear Stream Restaurant\u2019s Old Man Ma, Qiao Shan, and Pei Pei\u2026The Old Turtle King smacked his lips regrettably. \u201cAlright, I won\u2019t persuade you to stay. I will be leaving the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range once I advance to the Golden Hall Realm as well. I\u2019ll go meet Little Brother at that time.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019ll naturally be there as well. I\u2019ve been looking forward to the luxuries in the human world for a long time.\u201d The Nine-tailed Fox King smiled to the point his peach shaped eyes narrowed, and his face was filled with a charming aura.\u201cAt that time, if I\u2019m able to meet with Big Brothers again, then we must only stop drinking when we\u2019re drunk,\u201d Chen Xi said seriously, and even a trace of a rare smile appeared on the corners of his mouth.\u2026Dusk.Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain. Under the gazes of the myriad of demons, a treasured vessel carried Chen Xi, Du Qingxi, Song Lin, and a total of four others to break open the sunset glow that was like blood, and fly towards an extremely distant place.\u201cMaster, I don\u2019t hate you for not bringing me along this time. Once my strength becomes strong, if you still won\u2019t keep me by your side, then I\u2019ll have to slit my throat and take my own life\u2026\u201d At the mountainside of Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, Mu Kui stood alone before the abode, he muttered as he gazed at the treasured vessel that tore through the clouds and left. His voice trembled, yet carried along a flavor of resoluteness and firmness. Whereas his face was already stained with tears, and it had completely drenched his clothes.\u2014 End of Book Two \u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 ArrivingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 90 \u2013 ArrivingUnder the starry sky, a treasure vessel of ancient make flashed by and vanished within the boundless night sky.Chen Xi sat cross-legged within a room in the treasure vessel.This treasure vessel was gifted to him by the Old Turtle King. It was solid and comfortable, and capable of blocking a full powered strike from a cultivator at the perfection-stage of the Violet Palace Realm. It was a good auxiliary type Magic Treasure.At this moment, many storage type Magic Treasures were placed before Chen Xi; there were rings, belts, bracelets\u2026 All of them flickered with a bright light, dazzling and colorful.Chen Xi\u2019s Spiritual Perception swept through the various storage Magic Treasures on the ground, observing the spirit herbs and spirit woods that were piled like a mountain, as well as the ores, materials, and rare and valuable objects of various colors. Most of the treasures were things he\u2019d never seen nor heard of, and it caused his eyes to be dazzled and his mind to be muddled, yet he was extremely fervent in his heart.Chen Xi swiftly pondered in his mind, and his hands didn\u2019t stop moving as they started to organize his spoils from this time.After a long time, Chen Xi had put everything in order appropriately, and he stood up before pushing the door open and leaving.At this moment, Du Qingxi, Duanmu Ze, and Song Lin were all at the head of the vessel, looking at the direction they were flying.They\u2019d already been flying for half a day, yet everything that entered their sight was still continuous lofty mountains and steep hills, but the shape of the mountains had become much shorter, and they were obviously about to fly out of the confines of the depths of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain.But there was still an extremely great problem laid before them, and that was the question of direction.They\u2019d all been inexplicably sent out of the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain into the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, and they were completely unable to recognize in which direction was Pine Mist City and which was Dragon Lake City.At this moment, they could only move along a straight line, as they wanted to discover a city that was occupied by humans as soon as possible so that they could confirm the directions.\u201cMiss Du, Brother Duan, Brother Song.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s voice sounded out from behind them.The three of them turned around and glanced at Chen Xi in surprise. Since they had ascended the vessel, Chen Xi had always stayed in his room. The three of them thought that this fellow intended to be in closed door cultivation until they arrived at Pine Mist City.\u201cThese are your Magic Treasures, take a look.\u201d Chen Xi paid no attention to their gazes. With a swing of his sleeve, three Magic Treasures that were coiled in the glow of treasures floated before him. It was a curved dagger that shot out azure lights, a sword that was suffused by starlight, and a cold and ghastly oddly shaped umbrella form Magic Treasure.\u201cMy Unity Azurelotus Dagger!\u201d\u201cAh! My Sevenstar Rainbow Sword!\u201d\u201cSkynet Thousandhook Umbrella, my baby!\u201dThe three of them exclaimed in surprised and their faces were covered in expressions of disbelief.These three Magic Treasures were all of high-grade yellow-rank. Even within their respective clans, they were existences that were extremely valuable. At this moment, it could be easily imagined how excited they were at recovering what was lost.\u201cI found this from the Dark Wyrm King. Check and see if it\u2019s damaged.\u201d Chen Xi swung his sleeve and the three Magic Treasures accurately flew back to their respective owners.\u201cFlawless without damage.\u201d Du Qingxi slightly sized it up and a trace of a rare happy smile appeared on her face that was usually icy cold like snow, and she said, \u201cChen Xi, I don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d\u201cYeah. This time within the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, if it wasn\u2019t for you, I\u2019m afraid all of us would have been refined into medicinal pills. Now you\u2019ve even helped us retrieve our treasures, it\u2019s truly\u2026\u201d Duanmu Ze recalled the dangers of this journey and was extremely grateful to Chen Xi. As he finished speaking, he actually didn\u2019t know how to express it.\u201cLittle Zeze, don\u2019t be nauseating, alright? We already owed Chen Xi more than enough, at any rate. We\u2019ll just use our lives to return it in the future, am I right? Chen Xi?\u201d Song Lin grinned.\u201cFuck off! You slovenly bastard! Do you understand the feelings between us men?\u201d Duanmu Ze glared as he spoke.\u201cOh, Little Zeze, you dare say I\u2019m not a man? You\u2019re looking for death?\u201d Song Lin exploded in rage as he cried out loudly.\u2026Chen Xi smiled and paid no attention to the dispute of the two. He came to the head of the vessel by himself and held an azure skinned bottle gourd as he gulped down a few mouthfuls of wine, his gaze silently looking at the distant night sky.It had already been almost an entire year since he entered the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain, the sword immortal\u2019s abode, then the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range.Too many things had occurred during this year. He felt that he was constantly dancing on the blade of a saber, dangerous and bloody, and it seemed that he would lose his life in the next moment.Under these conditions that were filled with danger, with killing intent lurked in every corner, he knew that if it wasn\u2019t for Ji Yu being by his side, he would have long since died thousands of times over. Whereas now, Ji Yu was unable to walk out of the abode any longer\u2026When he thought of this, Chen Xi held up the bottle gourd of wine and drank an extremely large mouthful. He borrowed the pungent and rich strength of the wine to relieve the gloominess and reluctance in his heart.At this moment, Chen Xi\u2019s gaze was glistening. Boundless confidence and pride surged out from him, and he was like a thoroughly tempered treasured sword that had been unsheathed!He\u2019d opened the knot in his heart.He\u2019d obtained confidence.He wasn\u2019t the silent and dull young man from before. During this one year of various dangerous tempering and under the witness of the countless slaughters during this year, he was walking step by step towards the path that leads to becoming a peak expert.Not bound by the past, unafraid of the future!\u2026\u201cChen Xi has changed\u2026 His Dao Heart has become stronger and stronger, and it\u2019s more and more pure, firm, and perfect.\u201d Nearby, Du Qingxi had always been silently observing Chen Xi, watching his drink wine, watching him stare blankly, and watching the strong confidence that surged out from his body now, and she felt a wave of bewilderment in her heart.One year ago, he was only a frail youth at the Congenital Realm, a jinx that was known to all in Pine Mist City. He rushed about busily, crafting talismans and practicing the culinary arts without attracting public attention, and he was even ridiculed, mocked, and had his dignity trampled on.Yet now, who dared look down on him?In the sword immortal\u2019s abode, he\u2019d caused a chaotic battle with a single sentence, then dispelled his own dangerous situation with a few words. His thoughts were meticulous and he took every possibility into account.In the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, he\u2019d killed the Black Ape King, Thunderhawk King, Dark Wyrm King, and even comprehended a complete Wind Dao Insight to annihilate the Roc King in a hopeless situation. His comprehension ability was extraordinary and his strength climbed steadily.On Moon\u2019s Embrace Mountain, a myriad of demons came to congratulate him in an unprecedentedly grand occasion. Mu Kui willingly acknowledged him as master, and two demon kings became friends with him. He was just like a born leader with unparalleled bearing.Who would dare humiliate a youth like him?Don\u2019t bully a youth for being weak!The more Du Qingxi thought about it, the more shocked she was. Her emotions fluctuated like a rising and setting tide, and unknowingly, she was already infatuated.\u201cLook, quickly! That\u2019s\u2026 Lights!\u201d It was at this moment that Duanmu Ze suddenly yelled out in pleasant surprise.Swoosh!The gazes of everyone looked towards the same direction.Within the boundless night sky, a wisp of light appeared extremely far in the distance, and as their distance came closer, that light was like a fire dragon that occupied five million kilometers. Shockingly, it was an enormous city that was brightly illuminated!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 Misty Sea CityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 91 \u2013 Misty Sea CityWhen the treasured vessel was still 50km from the city in the darkness of the night, Chen Xi was finally able to clearly see the name of the city, and the information of Misty Sea City instantly surfaced in his heart.Misty Sea City, the second largest city in the southern territory with a scale only inferior to Dragon Lake City, and it obtained its name from the neighboring Misty Sea. This city was the transportation hub of the southern territory, and all the goods of the southern territory were gathered here before flowing towards the cities in all directions and out of the southern territory. Trade flourished here and merchants gathered here.If one spoke about the level of luxury, then even Dragon Lake City was inferior to Misty Sea City!Of course, Dragon Lake City was the heart of the southern territory after all, and various ancient sects, clans, and institutions gathered there. It was the cultivation holy lands in the heart of all the cultivators in the southern territory.\u201cIt\u2019s actually Misty Sea City. This city is the most luxurious place in the entire southern territory, and you can practically buy anything that you want here, like Magic Treasures, puppets, medicinal pills, cultivation techniques\u2026 and even beautiful females and rare treasures of different races from over the seas. So long as your purse is sufficiently full, then you can buy anything here!\u201d Duanmu Ze\u2019s eyes were extremely bright. This Young Master from the Duanmu Clan had obviously frequently fooled around in Misty Sea City and he was able to speak knowledgeably about it.\u201cOh, I want to go to the Immortal Indulgence Restaurant. There\u2019s a five leaf spirit chef in charge there, and the dishes cooked by the spirit chef are even endlessly coveted by Golden Core Realm cultivators.\u201d When Song Lin spoke about food, he instantly changed into a different appearance, he was in high spirits and possessed a burning gaze, and there wasn\u2019t a trace of drowsy sleepiness on him.\u201cMisty Sea City is only 15,000km from Dragon Lake City, but it\u2019s at least over 50,000km away from Pine Mist City.\u201d Du Qingxi looked at Chen Xi as she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we rest a day here before departing?\u201dChen Xi was anxious to return home as soon as possible and originally intended to refuse, but he suddenly recalled that there were various treasures within his storage pouch to be sold and agreed at once.He\u2019d once heard someone say that there was a Treasure Heaven Pavilion in Misty Sea City. Within it, nothing was lacking and everything was sold. It even provided trade methods such as auctions and exchanging of goods for goods, and its business could be found all over the Darchu Dynasty.This Treasure Heaven Pavilion in Misty Sea City was one of its branches, and it was the money spending den that possessed the greatest scale and reputation in the entire southern territory.Duanmu Ze rubbed his fists together as he said excitedly, \u201cWhat? You want to go to the Treasure Heaven Pavilion? I\u2019ll follow you, I know that place.\u201d\u201cAlright, then I\u2019ll be troubling Brother Duanmu.\u201d Chen Xi nodded. After all, it was slightly safer with someone he was acquainted with accompanying him.\u201cI\u2019ll go as well.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re unoccupied and have nothing to do, let\u2019s go together.\u201dSong Lin and Du Qingxi spoke as well, as they wanted to follow Chen Xi.Chen Xi was stunned, then turned around to look at Xue Jing, Mo Han, and Di Hongtu in the corner.On the way here, he\u2019d found out the background of the three. Xue Jing was a Limitless Sect disciple, Mo Han was a Clearworld Sect disciple, and Di Hongtu was an Azuresun Sect disciple. The sects of these three were all part of the eight great sects of Dragon Lake City, with hidden resources and reserves that were abundant and ancient. Their sects even slightly surpassed the six great clans behind Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three.However, since the three of them were in the same group as Su Jiao, they were naturally differentiated as being from the enemy camp by Chen Xi, and although there was no enmity to speak of, it was impossible for them to become friends.\u201cFellow Daoist Chen Xi doesn\u2019t have to mind us. It\u2019s all thanks to Fellow Daoist Chen Xi\u2019s help that we were able to leave the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range, and we\u2019ll bid our farewells with everyone now. If we have the opportunity to meet in Dragon Lake City in the future, then we\u2019ll surely entertain you with boundless hospitality to express our appreciation for Fellow Daoist Chen Xi\u2019s lifesaving kindness.\u201d Mo Han who possessed a steady disposition walked forward and bowed as he spoke.Chen Xi cupped his hand yet said no more. Not killing them was already his limit, as for the so-called appreciation Mo Han spoke off, he didn\u2019t take it seriously at all. At that time, it would be sufficient so long as they didn\u2019t stab him in the back.Mo Han\u2019s group of three didn\u2019t say anything further, they leaped off the treasured vessel that flew towards Misty Sea City.\u201cActually, these three only have a superficial relationship with Su Jiao, and the reason they were together was only because the powers behind them possessed a good relationship with the Su Clan,\u201d Du Qingxi said in a light voice.Chen Xi smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t mention them, it kills the mood. But thank you for your guidance.\u201d\u201cWho asked us to be friends?\u201d Du Qingxi smiled as well.After Chen Xi put away the treasured vessel, they didn\u2019t stay and flashed towards the distant Misty Sea City.When they walked into the city, a wide area entered their eyes. The ground in an area of 3.3km was level like it was sanded down from a single rock, and it was smooth like glaze. Row upon row of various buildings went along the spacious limestone road, winding into the distance until the end couldn\u2019t be seen.It was already deep in the night now, yet the city was still bright as day.The entire city was decorated with lanterns and colored decorations. The lights of various colors that flowed with a brilliant light hung on every corner of the street, causing it to be brightly lit like numerous fire dragons that were wriggling as they stayed there.Beautiful, dazzling and magnificent\u2026Chen Xi couldn\u2019t help but be speechless when he saw such a luxurious and prosperous scene. He walked through the city gate with a heart filled with surprise. It was like he\u2019d walked into another world, and the scene that was gorgeous like a painting was mixed with a wave of clamor as it assaulted his face.Diverse cultivators could be seen everywhere on the spacious street, wearing clothes of different fashions and wearing different crests. They were all obviously from different sects.There were also many cultivators that were like peddlers, spreading out a stall on the ground at the side of the street before soliciting customers with a loud voice; it was extremely bustling.Chen Xi was even able to see some cultivators from other territories sitting on some oddly shaped mounts; they leisurely and unhurriedly walked on the street as they took a brief look. No matter whether it was bearing, appearance, or dress, it was all extremely strange, and they were obviously not cultivators from the area of the southern territory.But in next to no time, Chen Xi was secretly awestruck. In an extremely short amount of time, he\u2019d already noticed at least a few tens of Violet Palace Realm cultivators. There were even a few Golden Hall Realm cultivators that he barely caught a glimpse of before they flashed and vanished on the street.Compared to this, Pine Mist City was indeed like a small town at the border. At least in Pine Mist City, a Violet Palace Realm cultivator was already an existence that was at the top. Whereas at Misty Sea City, Violet Palace Realm cultivators instead seemed as if they could be seen anywhere, and the two of them were obviously not on the same level.They walked and looked around all day, and before long, Chen Xi\u2019s group had arrived before an incomparably large building.\u201cLook, this is the Treasure Heaven Pavilion.\u201d Duanmu Ze pointed with his mouth, and he had an excited expression.Chen Xi was slightly muddled instantly, the building before him was 3km tall and occupied an area of over 50 hectares. It seemed to be entirely made from white jade. Numerous crystal lanterns hung beneath the exquisite and spinning roof, illuminating it to the point that glowing rays shone in all directions and the aura of treasures shot into the sky. Moreover, a shocking fluctuation was vaguely emitted by it, as an extremely formidable formation had obviously been placed on it.\u201cInnumerable amounts of priceless treasures were gathered in this Treasure Heaven Pavilion, and the royal family of the Darchu Dynasty is behind it, so there\u2019s no need to worry about safety. Like this Treasure Heaven Pavilion before us, not only does it possess seven Golden Core Realm cultivators holding down the fort, moreover, there\u2019s always an extremely mysterious Rebirth Realm cultivator that stays here.\u201d Duanmu Ze spoke with fervor and assurance, as if he was extremely familiar of the Treasure Heaven Pavilion.\u201cAh, so it\u2019s Young Master Duanmu, please come in quickly, please come in quickly.\u201d The eyes of a female attendant with an extremely beautiful appearance couldn\u2019t help but light up when she saw Duanmu Ze, and she jogged all the way over while beaming with smiles.Duanmu Ze casually nodded with a reserved expression, and he\u2019d returned to that appearance of his that possessed a superb demeanor.\u201cI never imagined that this fellow is rather famous, even the attendants actually know him.\u201d Chen Xi glanced at Duanmu Ze in surprise, and he couldn\u2019t help but re-evaluate the power possessed by the six great clans of Dragon Lake City.\u201cPrepare a standard room for us, this brother of mine wants to sell some treasures. Hmmm, invite some appraisers as well.\u201d Duanmu Ze casually instructed.\u201cYoung Master, please follow me.\u201d Only now did the female attendant notice Chen Xi. She only slightly sized him up before withdrawing her gaze, and her smile was even more moving. She didn\u2019t dare offend someone that was able to be in a group with Duanmu Ze, even if Chen Xi was dressed shabbily.Chen Xi and the others follow behind the female attendant and walked into the Treasure Heaven Pavilion. They walked along the wide and exquisite arched walkway and arrived at a standard room that was magnificent.It was said to be a standard room, yet the space within was an area of 330m, with a scarlet red carpet covering the floor and an incense burner that was shaped like an auspicious beast with the smoke of incense curling upwards from it. Screens with paintings of landscapes on them were scattered in the surroundings, and strands of dinging and rattling sounds of graceful music slowly sounded out within the quiet and elegant room.The female attendant delivered some fresh fruits and fine wine before silently leaving.Chen Xi secretly sighed emotionally in his heart. With his sight, he was naturally able to discern that there was a grand formation placed within the entire room, and not only did it condense abundant spirit energy, it was even able to cut off eavesdropping from the outside world. It was extremely marvelous.\u201cTreasure Heaven Pavilion\u2019s Appraiser Le Qi has come to meet Young Master Duanmu.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before a deep voice sounded out from outside the door.\u201cCome in,\u201d said Duanmu Ze.Subsequently, a grey clothed, middle aged man pushed open the door and entered. He cupped his hands towards everyone present as he asked. \u201cMay I ask which Young Master wants to sell some treasures? May I have a look so that I\u2019m able to estimate a price?\u201dThis grey clothed middle aged man called Le Qi was neither humble nor arrogant, his attitude was neither warm nor fervent, displaying an extremely high accomplishment in his occupation. Obviously, he was relying on his appraisal skill to act in such a way.\u201cThis Master Le Qi is an appraiser with extremely great qualifications in the Treasure Heaven Pavilion, and he possesses discerning eyes that are filled with wisdom. He\u2019d most skilled in the appraisal of spirit materials and ordinary people are utterly unable to make him attend to them. Chen Xi, what treasures do you plan to sell?\u201dDuanmu Ze turned to look at Chen Xi with a burning gaze, seeming to be extremely curious as to exactly what Chen Xi wanted to sell.It wasn\u2019t only Duanmu Ze, even Du Qingxi and Song Lin were extremely curious. After all, if they were ordinary things, there was entirely no need to sell it here, as although the Treasure Heaven Pavilion wasn\u2019t bad, it still collected quite a sum of fees.\u201cA lot.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s reply was extremely pithy, and he swung his sleeve. Instantly, an exceedingly great pile of treasures that were coiled by the light of spirit energy and were suffused with brilliant lights appeared on the ground. There were spirit herbs, spirit woods, materials for equipment refinement, extremely rare and valuable objects\u2026 They were mixed together like a mountain of treasures, causing the entire standard room to be suffused with a layer of colorful brilliance.Hiss!Besides Chen Xi, everyone with the room gasped.\u201cAll these are useless to me, I want to exchange them for spirit liquids. Master Le, please do a count,\u201d Chen Xi said indifferently.These treasures were an entire ten plus thousand in numbers and were plundered from the Black Ape King and the other three demon kings. There were also some that were gifted by the demons in the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range. Most of them were materials like spirit herbs and spirit woods that were rare and precious treasures in the outside world, but unfortunately, their quality wasn\u2019t too high and wasn't of great use to Chen Xi. Thus, he naturally wanted to completely deal with them so that he could exchange them for some spirit liquids to use for his cultivation.\u201cGive\u2026 Give me a moment to count it.\u201d Le Qi took a deep breath and was barely able to suppress the excitement in his heart, then he was like a hungry tiger pouncing at its food as he drilled into the pile of treasures and made an inventory of them one by one. His appearance was like a wolf that was extremely hungry.Obviously, to an appraiser like Le Qi, being able to possess so many treasures for him to make an inventory of was undoubtedly an extremely happy thing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 Violetgold Treasure Heaven TokenPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92 \u2013 Violetgold Treasure Heaven TokenAzure-leaf Cicada Shell!Jade-spiral Bloodsun Ginseng!Seventh-Disaster Herb!\u2026Every time Le Qi identified the name of a material, he would be shocked in his heart and his eyes would grow brighter and brighter. The movements of his hands became even gentler, it wasn\u2019t like he was identifying materials, but was instead like he was stroking the face of his lover.As one of the appraisers in the Misty Sea City\u2019s Treasure Heaven Pavilion with the greatest qualifications, Le Qi\u2019s eyes had been trained to be extraordinarily sharp since long ago, and the various materials that had passed through his hands were too numerous to enumerate. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t seen a valuable sprit material, however, when he saw the spirit materials that were piled into a small hill before him, he was still shocked.Endlessly shocked!Shocked like tidewater that became more and more turbulent!Truthfully speaking, these spirit materials weren\u2019t of high grade, and even could only be considered to be low grade. But every one of them were extremely rare, to the extent that practically all of them were extinct materials that hadn\u2019t been found in the world since long ago!No matter if it was refining medicinal pills, puppets, or Magic Treasures, all of them had a differentiation between primary materials and supplementary materials. Primary materials were naturally extremely valuable existences that decided the grade and rank of the treasure after it was completed, yet supplementary materials were similarly hugely important. It was to the extent that even if the primary materials were complete, the lack of a required supplementary material would cause the treasure to be utterly impossible to be refined.For example, the medicinal pill that was extremely popular in the cultivation world a thousand years ago, the Cultivation Condensation Powder. After being consumed by a cultivator, it was able to help to explosively increase the probability of breaking through and developing the Violet Palace Realm and Dao Foundation by 20%. How formidable was that? Moreover, it was precisely because of the extinction of a low grade supplementary material called Treasured Turtledove Flower that the Cultivation Condensation Powder was buried into oblivion a thousand years ago, as they only possessed the medicinal formula but were unable to refine it.There were many other examples like this.Some medicinal formulas, weapons refinement techniques, and beast taming techniques that had been inherited from ancient times had all gradually vanished within the cultivation world due to the lack of some type of spirit material.Le Qi was naturally aware of this, and it was exactly because he knew these past incidents that when he saw numerous spirit materials that should have been buried in history had appeared before him, the shock in his heart could be easily imagined.Hu~Le Qi heaved a sigh and restrained the excitement in his heart as he started to swiftly organize the materials. At this moment, he displayed extremely high professionalism, he maneuvered swiftly to pick, classify, and organize the spirit materials that were piled like a mountain in an orderly manner. His movements were gentle and smooth, and it was pleasant to the eye.\u201cIs there something special about these materials? It looks to me like only the amount is high.\u201d Duanmu Ze couldn\u2019t help but ask in a low voice. He was truly unable to understand why a great appraiser like Le Qi would be so excited, as if he\u2019d consumed an extremely strong medicine that possessed extreme Yang properties.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed extremely normal.\u201d Du Qingxi thought for a moment, then replied. \u201cBut they\u2019re extremely rare. All these are practically spirit materials that are unable to be bought on the market, moreover, most of them went extinct extremely long ago.\u201dDuanmu Ze was still unable to wrap his head around it.Chen Xi instead had instantly wrapped his head around it, due to the effect of the River Diagram fragment. The depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range had always been isolated from the outside world for a million years. It was like a realm outside of the world that had grown boundless amounts of spirit herbs and spirit woods, coupled with demons attaching importance to nature and weren\u2019t like human cultivators who seized and took control of all resources. The spirit herbs and spirit woods within it were naturally able to perfectly survive until now.Even though he understood this, Chen Xi still persisted in selling these things. He wasn\u2019t an alchemist, tamer, or equipment refiner\u2026 There was no great use for him to keep these materials, so why not sell them?\u201cThe total is 80,000 spirit herbs and spirit woods, 27,032 ores, and 40,099 types of other materials.\u201d It was at this moment that Le Qi had completed his inventory. When he stood up, he was still slightly in an endless trance within his mind. 99% of all these materials were rare existences that had gone extinct in the world, and when he\u2019d seen so many in such a short amount of time, even he slightly felt as if he was dreaming.\u201cHow much is it worth?\u201d asked Chen Xi.\u201cMaster Le Qi, Chen Xi is my brother, you better not cheat us.\u201d Duanmu Ze smiled broadly as he reminded with a voice that vaguely carried a trace of warning.Le Qi was naturally able to perceive it and said respectfully to Chen Xi right away, \u201cIf it\u2019s calculated according to spirit liquids, these over one hundred thousand materials ought to be worth not less than 2.5 million kg of spirit liquid.\u201dDu Qingxi and the others were all stunned.It was common knowledge that cultivators below the Violet Palace Realm were only able to use spirit stones and spirit jades to cultivate or purchase some goods required for cultivating; whereas cultivators at the Violet Palace Realm and above used spirit liquids as currency or to measure the worth of the treasures in the world.2.5 million kgs of spirit liquid was sufficient to be exchanged for hundreds of top-grade yellow-rank Magic Treasures, or over ten profound-rank Magic Treasures!The highest quality weapon within the possessions of Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three was only at the high-grade yellow rank. At this moment when they heard the astronomical figure that Le Qi declared, their hearts were naturally fiercely shocked.Chen Xi sighed in surprise in his heart, yet he revealed no change in his composure. \u201cMay I ask Master Le, what do you mean by at least 2.5 million kgs? Could it be that even you\u2019re unable to determine the specific worth?\u201dLe Qi nodded. \u201cThis bill is too huge and I don\u2019t dare to rashly give a price to it myself. Please wait for a moment, everyone. I\u2019ll go discuss it with the various managers before coming back to meet all of you.\u201d As soon as he finished speaking, Le Qi left hastily.\u2026Treasure Heaven Pavilion, top floor.The Treasure Heaven Pavilion was the tallest building in Misty Sea City at 3km high, like a heavenly pillar that stood below the starry sky. When one is atop it, the bright stars that were the size of a fist seemed as if they could be easily plucked down.At this moment, Le Qi stood on the top floor with a respectful expression, and an extremely beautiful woman lay with an elegant and graceful posture on the soft couch opposite him.Her upward slanting eyes were like water, with a beautiful appearance and tender white skin, and her jet-black hair was like clouds that hung down loosely. As she lay sideways on the soft couch, her graceful figure was fully portrayed, revealing her boundless charm.If Duanmu Ze was here, he would surely recognize this woman; she was the owner of the Treasure Heaven Pavilion in Misty Sea City \u2014 \u00a0Madam Shui Hua!Supposedly, Madam Shui Hua was a princess of the Darchu Dynasty\u2019s imperial family. She possessed the bloodline of the imperial family and an exceedingly respected status, and her cultivation was unfathomable. In Misty Sea City, almost no one dared be disrespectful to her, and even in the entire southern territory, the status of Madam Shui Hua was extremely extraordinary.\u201c99% of them are spirit materials that have vanished and were annihilated a thousand years ago?\u201d Madam Shui Hua\u2019s charming brows frowned as she said, \u201cBut this seems to be nothing worthy of being amazed, right? You came to see me because of this?\u201d Her voice was hoarse, yet carried along a trace of an inexplicable magnetism. It felt like a cat\u2019s paw scratching the heart, causing one to be unable to help one\u2019s self from becoming excited and fantasizing.However, Le Qi\u2019s heart shook instead, seeming to be extremely fearful of this incomparably beautiful woman, and he said hurriedly, \u201cReporting to Madam, the worth of these spirit materials are expensive, but they can\u2019t be considered as much. What I suspect is that since he possesses these low grade spirit materials that had vanished from the world, then would he also possess valuable spirit materials that already don\u2019t exist in the world since long ago?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Madam Shui Hua\u2019s upward slanting eyes revealed a trace of deep thought, and she suddenly asked after some time. \u201cDid you inquire about his background?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s called Chen Xi and ought to be a Violet Palace Realm cultivator. As for the others, I don\u2019t know. Oh, right. He came together with a Young Master from the Duanmu Clan this time.\u201d Le Qi replied.\u201cDuanmu Clan?\u201d Madam Shui Hua thought for a moment, then instructed. \u201cGive him 3 million kgs of spirit liquid, then present him with my Treasure Heaven Pavilion\u2019s Violetgold Treasure Heaven Token, and properly establish a relationship with him.\u201dLe Qi was stunned, and he stared blankly at a loss for what to say.The Treasure Heaven Pavilion would give out some tokens to honored guests, and they were divided into five levels namely Copper, Silver, Gold, Violetgold, and Amethyst. Relying on these tokens, the possessors were able to obtain the highest level of service in any Treasure Heaven Pavilion in the Darchu Dynasty and acquire the most preferential price when buying treasures.However, the conditions for giving out these tokens was extremely harsh, and even the copper token was utterly impossible to acquire without a certain level of status and identity.According to Le Qi\u2019s knowledge, the Violetgold Treasure Heaven Token was ordinarily given out to the Patriarch of a clan, the Master of a sect, or a cultivator that had attained the strength of the Golden Core Realm. The level of its preciousness was merely inferior to the highest level, the Amethyst Treasure Heaven Token!There were only a mere few tens of people in the entire Darchu Dynasty who possessed the Amethyst Treasure Heaven Token. Their status, identity, and strength had all attained a peak level that was difficult to reach for ordinary people. They were all formidable figures who commanded great power.Even the City Governor of Misty Sea City had only obtained a Violetgold Treasure Heaven Token.At this moment, when he heard Madam Shui Hua wanted to gift a Violetgold Treasure Heaven Token to Chen Xi, the shock in Le Qi\u2019s heart was impossible to be described by words, and he was in a silent trance for a long time.\u201cWhat is there to be surprised about?\u201d Madam Shui Hua spoke unhurriedly. \u201cIt\u2019s only a Violetgold Treasure Heaven Token. If no one uses it, then it\u2019s merely a piece of scrap metal.\u201dLe Qi began to speak, then hesitated. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can leave now. I\u2019ll be returning to Silken City after some time. Before this, find out clearly about this Chen Xi\u2019s background then report it to me.\u201d Madam Shui Hua lazily waved her hand.\u201cYes.\u201d Le Qi had a bellyful of wonder as he turned and left.Not long after Le Qi left, Madam Shui Hua seemed to be absorbed in thought as she muttered. \u201cChen Xi, he ought to be a survivor of the Chen Clan that group of people annihilated. His mother is an extraordinary figure. Heh, truly interesting. I\u2019ll sow a piece of good fate with him and see if he\u2019s actually able to live until\u2026\u201d Her voice grew softer and softer, lower and lower, and it vanished from the empty luxurious room like a howl of the wind.\u2026\u201c3 million kgs of spirit liquid!\u201d\u201cVioletgold Treasure Heaven Token!\u201dDu Qingxi\u2019s group of three almost didn\u2019t dare believe their eyes and ears, and they all stared at Chen Xi as if they were looking at a freak.Even if it was within the clans behind them, 3 million kgs of spirit liquids was an enormous amount as well. But comparatively speaking, the Violetgold Treasure Heaven Token caused an even greater shock to them. After all, even within the enormous clan behind them, only a few people were able to possess the Violetgold Treasure Heaven Token!When the nearby Le Qi saw this scene, he sighed endlessly in his heart as well. He was truly unable to figure out why Madam Shui Hua would do this. Not only did she increase the price by a great deal, she\u2019d even gifted a Violetgold Treasure Heaven Token!Le Qi didn\u2019t believe that Madam Shui Hua, who\u2019d always been shrewd like a fox, would do such a stupid thing. There was surely something concealed within it.When he thought of this, he couldn\u2019t help but size Chen Xi up.Chen Xi instead didn\u2019t think about it so much. He came to the Treasure Heaven Pavilion for the sake of selling these spirit materials that were of no use to him, and for the sake of purchasing a sword formation and some Magic Treasures to increase his strength.He wanted to purchase the sword formation to be used in combination with the eight Netherezim Flying Swords, and he wanted to purchase Magic Treasures instead to increase his strength a step further. After all, although the Seventhgold Swordbamboo was sharp, when all was said and done, it was an equipment refinement material that hadn\u2019t been refined, and its might was far from being displayed completely.Chen Xi pondered secretly. Compared to demon-kind, human cultivators were more ruthless and cunning, more despicable and heartless. So he had to be on guard against being killed and his treasures seized.Chen Xi was slightly unable to endure the strange gazes Du Qingxi and the others shot at him, so he directly said, \u201cMaster Le, does the Treasure Heaven Pavilion sell sword formations?\u201d\u201cUh.\u201d Le Qi was as if he\u2019d just awoken from a dream, then he nodded and said, \u201cOf course we do!\u201d As he spoke, he swung his sleeve and a jade booklet that was coiled by mist flew into Chen Xi\u2019s hand.\u201cThis is my Treasure Heaven Pavilion\u2019s Universal Book, and its name contains the meaning of covering all things within the universe. All the rare treasures that my Treasure Heaven Pavilion sells are within this superb collection, and there are at least a thousand types of treasures related to sword formation diagrams. Moreover, every one of them are of top quality. Fellow Daoist, please take a look if there\u2019s anything that\u2019s to your liking.\u201d When he spoke of his own things, Le Qi possessed an appearance of taking honor and pride.Chen Xi flipped open the jade booklet, and at the instant he started reading through it, a strand of surprise had instantly arisen within his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword FormationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93 \u2013 Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword FormationThe Universal Book was divided into over 100 categories, like medicinal pills, talisman formations, rare treasures, etc. Amongst them, the number of Magic Treasures was undoubtedly the highest and it occupied half the Universal Book.The make of the Universal Book was exquisite beyond compare as well, and a Formation Master had placed a Minor Illusory Rainbow Formation on it. The treasures that were displayed on every page were lifelike, as if the real objects were emitting dazzling lights as it was displayed before one\u2019s eyes, and it was extremely beautiful.Chen Xi repeatedly sighed in surprise in his heart as he flipped through the Universal Book.The Magic Treasures in the book started from sabers, spears, swords, halberds, axes, battle-axes, hooks, tridents\u2026 Even treasure bottles, glazed crystals, lanterns, lotus thrones, etc. It simple contained everything, and it indeed could be said to cover all things within the universe.\u201cChen Xi, if you flip through it like this, then you wouldn\u2019t finish even after three days and three nights.\u201d Duanmu Ze reminded from the side. \u201cThe Universal Book is known to be covering all things within the universe, the Magic Treasures gathered within it is an astronomical figure!\u2019Hu!Chen Xi lightly let out a mouthful of air and cleared his head, then he tossed away the disorderly and distracting thoughts in his mind, then found the sword formation category right away before starting to flip through it one by one.After all, even if there were more Magic Treasures in the book, most of them weren\u2019t suitable for him. Only by finding the Magic Treasure he was skilled in would he be able to make full use of his strength.After Chen Xi sighed in surprise, he shook his head. The eight Netherezim Flying Swords were all of the icy attribute, and the Ice Crane Technique he cultivated was an icy attribute cultivation technique. Water and fire didn\u2019t mix, so no matter how formidable the Azureflame Splitlight Sword Formation was, it was still unsuitable for him.One by one, Chen Xi flipped through the sword formation diagrams.Even if it was one that Chen Xi wasn\u2019t adept in using, he would still be extremely covetous when he looked at it, yet only a few sword formations truly moved his heart.Whoosh!The Universe Book was lifted open once again.The nearby Le Qi couldn\u2019t refrain from reminding when he saw this. \u201cFellow Daoist, you seem to still be at the Violet Palace Realm, right? Continuing hereafter in the Universe Book are profound-rank sword formation diagrams that are things Golden Palace Realm cultivators choose. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re unable to use it.\u201dOrdinarily, man-made yellow-rank, profound-rank, earth-rank, and heaven-rank Magic Treasures of every grade had their own requirements for the strength of the soul and True Essence. For example, a profound-rank Magic Treasure required a cultivation of at least at the Golden Hall Realm to bind it, or an earth-rank Magic Treasure required a cultivation at least at the Gold Core Realm to bind it.However, Chen Xi was an exception.His soul had already condensed into Spiritual Perception, and it even surpassed ordinary Golden Hall Realm cultivators, whereas the Ice Crane Technique he cultivated caused his True Essence to be incomparably thick and pure. Although he was only at the 5th star of the Violet Palace Realm, his True Essence was even thicker than some perfection-stage Violet Palace Realm cultivators, and this was the benefit of cultivating a treasured qi refinement cultivation technique.According to Chen Xi\u2019s current cultivation, it wouldn\u2019t be strenuous to control a profound-rank sword formation.After all, a sword formation was able to control numerous flying swords according to a profound formation in battle. In essence, it still tested the strength of the soul towards the flying swords, and together with the True Essence, they decided the might of the sword formation together.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!Chen Xi paid no attention to him and silently flipped through the sword formations.Le Qi didn\u2019t continue offering advice when he saw this. Chen Xi was the buyer after all, and if Chen Xi wanted to buy a heaven-rank Magic Treasure, he couldn\u2019t interfere with it, right?Chen Xi was stunned, and only now did he clearly see the label on the corner \u2018Incomplete,\u2019 and he couldn\u2019t help but sigh with emotion.\u201cMaster Le, how much spirit liquid is this Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation worth?\u201d Chen Xi raised his head and asked.\u201c400,000 kgs.\u201d Le Qi was extremely afraid that Chen Xi would misunderstand and explained. \u201cEven though this Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation is incomplete, its might is one of the most formidable amongst profound-rank sword formations. If it wasn\u2019t for it being incomplete, its worth would be greatly higher.\u201dNo matter how coolly Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three were, they couldn\u2019t help but be speechless when they heard this amount, and they all moved forward to inspect this formation.\u201cThe might of this sword formation is indeed formidable, as only an incomplete formation is able to attain the ranks of profound-ranks sword formation, but its requirements towards True Essence and the strength of the soul is extremely harsh. Chen Xi, although you\u2019ve already attained the Violet Palace Realm now, buying it is probably slightly inadvisable, right?\u201d Du Qingxi advised as well. \u201cNo matter how great a sword formation is, it\u2019s still trash if it can\u2019t be used after purchase. I suggest you pick another and find one that suits you better, as only then would you be able to make full use of your entire strength.\u201d\u201cYeah, don\u2019t strive to outdo yourself.\u201d Duanmu Ze said as well.\u201cChen Xi, please think it over!\u201d Even Song Lin who was always had sleepy eyes and was in a daze had spoken out.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Chen Xi lightly smiled, then said to Le Qi right away, \u201cI\u2019ll take this Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation!\u201d\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll send this sword formation diagram over later. I wonder if Fellow Daoist still requires anything else?\u201d Le Qi answered with an expressionless face, yet he sighed in his heart.\u201c56 flying swords, all of the high-grade yellow-rank.\u201d Chen Xi had thought it over before saying this. He possessed eight top-grade yellow-rank Netherezim Flying Swords, so if he wanted to execute the second level of the Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation, he naturally required another 56 flying swords. However, the Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation was a profound-rank sword formation after all, and he was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be able to control it very well, so he could only take the second best and choose high-grade yellow-rank flying swords.When he thought up to here, Chen Xi suddenly recalled his younger brother, Chen Hao.Instantly, Chen Xi said once more, \u201cBesides that, I\u2019ll purchase another 64 high-grade yellow-rank flying swords.\u201dHiss!Even if Le Qi had already recognized Chen Xi as a rich man\u2019s son that threw money about, he couldn\u2019t refrain from gasping when he heard this and said with a stutter, \u201cFellow Daoist Chen Xi, one high-grade yellow-tank flying sword is worth 10,000 kgs of spirit liquid, so many flying swords are worth 1.2 million kgs of spirit liquid!\u201dAt the same time, he felt inexpressible excitement in his heart.Le Qi started counting swiftly in his mind, and a strong feeling of happiness surged through his entire body, causing him to be unable to restrain a trace of a silly smile from appearing on his face.The nearby Du Qingxi and the others were startled by Chen Xi\u2019s actions as well, but they didn\u2019t question him when they saw Chen Xi\u2019s calm expression, as he didn\u2019t seem to have gone mad. But even then, these direct line disciples born of the great clans couldn\u2019t help but be endlessly amazed by Chen Xi\u2019s lavish spending.If he said it didn\u2019t pain him to spend 1.6 million Kgs of spirit liquid in a short moment, that would be a lie. However, when he thought of how his strength would be able to increase greatly, and when he thought of the happy smile Chen Hao would have when he gifted the 64 flying swords to him, Chen Xi felt that all this was worth it.Because he had the Violetgold Treasure Heaven Token in his possession, Le Qi gave Chen Xi a discount of 100,000 Kgs of spirit liquids. When he walked out of the Treasure Heaven Pavilion, not only did Chen Xi\u2019s storage ring have an additional sword formation diagram, there were also 120 high-grade yellow-rank flying swords and another 1.5 million Kgs of spirit liquids that was the remainder after selling the spirit materials and deducting the cost of buying the sword formation diagram and flying swords.Originally, Chen Xi intended to buy some Magic Treasures for Du Qingxi and the others, but he encountered constant refusal from the three. According to what Duanmu Ze said, \u201cYou should keep these spirit liquids for your cultivating. As for the three of us? We don\u2019t lack money!\u201dIt was already deep into the night, yet it was still dazzling within Misty Sea City, and it seemed like a city that never sleeps as it stood beneath the night sky.The clans behind Du Qingxi and the others all had a branch in Misty Sea City that was used for auctioning and purchasing goods, and their scales were rather big, possessing numerous Golden Hall Realm experts holding down the forts.After they left Treasure Heaven Pavilion, the three of them had all invited Chen Xi to head to their clan\u2019s outpost to stay, but Chen Xi refused, as he was anxious to return home as soon as possible.Compared to Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three, Chen Xi actually was only too anxious to return to Pine Mist City as soon as possible, and return to the home that he\u2019d been separated from for a year.Compelled by their helplessness, the three of them could only bring Chen Xi to the largest Immortal Indulgence Restaurant in Misty Sea City, as they planned to eat a banquet full of flavor and spirit energy as a form of farewell.The Immortal Indulgence Restaurant\u2019s size was large beyond all doubt, and its layout was elegant and refined, thus influential people within Misty Sea City were greatly fond of it.It was already dawn when Chen Xi\u2019s group arrived at the Immortal Indulgence Restaurant, yet the flow of customers within were still numerous like the clouds. Its business was extremely explosive and there were already no more rooms, thus they could only helplessly sit at a place nearby the window.Drink wine, enjoy dishes and chat.Unknowingly, the four youths had recalled the scene when they first met each other. They recalled the sorrows and happiness throughout their journey. They made fun and cursed angrily, ridiculed and cracked jokes, and the atmosphere was unrestrained. It was extremely satisfying and extremely comfortable.Even the smiles on Chen Xi\u2019s face grew more and more. Friendship that had experiences life, death, trials and tribulations, was like strong wine that was rich and suffused the mouth. The longer it lingered, the more fragrant the wine tasted, until the point one would always remember and recollect it.Where there was happy gathering, there was also parting.Outside the city gates of Misty Sea City, Chen Xi waved his hand in farewell towards Du Qingxi\u2019s group of three who were atop the city walls, then leaped onto the treasured vessel before swiftly flashing towards the distant sky.\u201cChen Xi, we\u2019ll be waiting for you in Dragon Lake City for the southern territory\u2019s Hidden Dragon Rankings a year from now, you must come!\u201d Duanmu Ze\u2019s screaming at the top of his lungs sounded out from afar.Chen Xi stood on the bow and boundless lofty sentiments surged out from within his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 When The Home Is Gone, One Should Kill!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94 \u2013 When The Home Is Gone, One Should Kill!A treasured vessel flew deep within the layer of clouds. Beneath it, mountains and rivers were like paintings, pedestrians were like ants, city after city, street after street, row upon row of buildings the size of a fingernail, and the luxuries of the world could all be taken into the eye.According to this speed, he would only need a few days before being able to return to Pine Mist City.Chen Xi sat cross-legged at the bow, carefully comprehending the Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation diagram.After he comprehended a complete Wind Dao Insight, Chen Xi\u2019s sight had already become incredibly discerning. As far as he was concerned, the Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation was simply made for him. Its speed was incomparably swift like the wind, sharp and quick like flowing lights that poured out, and it was deeply related to the key points of swift, accurate, and fierce.After a short moment, Chen Xi withdrew the eight Netherezim Flying Swords from his storage ring. As a flying sword, the Netherezim Flying Sword\u2019s external form was different from ordinary flying swords; they were one meter long and entirely icy cold like a pool of ice water, and they could also be held in the hand during battle.Hiss! Hiss!Chen Xi circulated his True Essence, then pricked open the tip of his finger before using his own Blood Essence to draw talisman markings on the Netherezim Flying Sword.When cultivating the Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation, one must first use one\u2019s Blood Essence to draw the mysterious Oblivionwind Talisman and Flowinglight Talisman on the flying swords, allowing a trace of a unique connection to be formed between the flying swords, so that they could easily act in cooperation with one another as if they were breathing. This step was also called setting up the formation markings, and without the formation markings, it couldn\u2019t be called a sword formation.With Chen Xi\u2019s experience in crafting talismans, drawing these two talisman markings were naturally an easy matter.But, to his surprise, the instant he completed the Oblivionwind Talisman and Flowinglight Talisman, there seemed to be a strand of mysterious energy on the flying sword that instantly drew a large amount of his Blood Essence!Hu!When he\u2019d completed the drawing of all the talisman markings on the eight Netherezim Flying Swords, Chen Xi\u2019s face was already completely ghastly pale, his mind terribly fatigued, and it was actually even more exhausting than a fierce battle.Chen Xi sighed with emotion, then he shot his gaze at the eight Netherezim Flying Swords.\u201cSetup!\u201dSwish! Swish! Swish! Swish!The eight Netherezim Flying Swords instantly floated around Chen Xi as sword qi that was ghastly and sharp gushed out. These flying swords were like a shoal of fish that were intelligent. Under the control of Chen Xi\u2019s soul, they either gathered or dispersed or crisscrossed both horizontally and vertically or in a straight line\u2026 They were nimble and reactive, and he commanded them with ease, as if the flying swords had become a part of his body.\u201cSomething seems to be off?\u201d Chen Xi silently pondered before suddenly recalled that a formation was already able to form a link with the energy of heaven and earth, and a sword formation was like this as well, it required sensing the heaven and earth, then transforming the energy of the heaven and the earth for one\u2019s own use\u2026After the time for an incense stick to burn.Chen Xi raised his head and his eyes were profound like stars. With a command in his heart, the eight Netherezim Flying Swords that floated around him emitted a clear cry in unison, seeming to have formed shapeless coordination with each other as if they were breathing. They\u2019d completely converged to become a single entity, synchronized with each other, yet also independent, and it faintly possessed an indescribably elusive feeling.Om!Misty sword light gushed out abruptly from the whole body of the eight flying swords, the sword lights were sharp like needles and flickered unsteadily as they cruised around Chen Xi\u2019s body. Although it was only a scarce eight flying swords, they revealed an unparalleled monstrous aura, like a group of soldiers that were cold and filled with killing intent, causing one to tremble in fear. Even the surroundings emitted buzzing sounds from being sliced by the sharp sword light.A trace of satisfaction was revealed on Chen Xi\u2019s face, then he said to himself,But, Chen Xi also knew that the Violet Palace Realm and the Golden Hall Realm were two great realms after all, if he were to encounter a Golden Hall Realm cultivator that was monstrous or even a monstrous Violet Palace Realm cultivator, he still wouldn\u2019t dare be slightly careless, as there were too many incidents of failing miserably in a task one was confident in within the cultivation world.Swoosh!The treasured vessel flew in the sky and an entire day passed quickly.Dusk, Chen Xi had just awoken from his cultivating when he raised his eyes to look, and the first thing that entered his eyes was a boundless mountain that continuously rose and fell; a boundless mountain range whose end couldn\u2019t be seen with a single glance.Shockingly, a city appeared before that mountain range. Its shape was like a tortoise shell and built with its back to the mountain. It occupied an area of 5,000km, but compared to the luxurious and prosperous Misty Sea City, it was instead pitiably small.Pine Mist City!Chen Xi stood up and concentrated his gaze to look into the distance. This was the first time he\u2019d seen the full view of Pine Mist City, and when he looked down upon it from high above in the sky, the entire city was fully revealed before his eyes.The General\u2019s Estate, the Institution District, the Commoners District\u2026 As he saw all the familiar scenes, Chen Xi suddenly had a feeling as if it had been ages.Senior Ji Yu said that after a cultivator established his Dao Foundation, the cultivator would start comprehending the Heaven\u2019s Dao, and would be able to faintly sense some good or bad luck. It was obscure and extremely profound, yet very accurate.An inexplicable feeling of worry had suddenly emerged in Chen Xi\u2019s heart, it emerged quickly and vanished equally swiftly. When he wanted to carefully understand it, it was already gone, and his heart was completely empty as if nothing had happened in that instant earlier.Chen Xi fiercely shook his head, then took a deep breath before putting away the treasured vessel and swiftly flashing towards the city gates.As he walked into the city gates and looked at the familiar streets and smelt the familiar smell in the air, not only did Chen Xi\u2019s strained heart ease up, it instead became even more strained, and his thoughts inexplicably became restless as well.He didn\u2019t stay and directly dashed towards his home.It was as if a faint intuition from the heavens were urging him to do this.His feet were as if they were flying, his figure like the wind, and Chen Xi\u2019s heart thumped even more strongly as he approached his home, like a pounding drum.Thump! Thump! Thump!His heart palpitated with anxiety and fear.Swoosh!Chen Xi stopped his feet as his pupils abruptly dilated and he didn\u2019t dare believe everything he saw before him.The Commoners District was divided into four plots, each occupying an area of 500km. The poverty stricken of Pine Mist City resided there, and Chen Xi\u2019s house was in one of those plots.It was already nightfall, and at this time in the past, the people that had labored all day would drag their exhausted bodies and return home as early as possible. They would be in groups, holding rice bowls as they bragged and chatted, calling out to their wives to wash the clothes and cook food. The little children would run around playing, and the boys and girls would be gathered together whispering in discussion\u2026However, at this moment, within this 500km area of land, there was no homes, no crowds of people, no noise, and was without the smell he\u2019d been familiar with for over ten years. Collapsed rubble lay all over the ground, crows cawed as they circled in the skies, and wild dogs gnawed on the corpses of the dead.Ruins!His home had turned to ruins!Chen Xi felt the world go dark as indescribable pain surged out from his heart. It ached to the point he held his chest, wanting to shout, yet noticed he was unable to emit the slightest sound.Chen Xi didn\u2019t dare believe all this as the intense pain and boundless rage was like tidewater that assaulted his consciousness, and his mind was blank.He was like a walking corpse, his legs like lead as he walked step by step towards the familiar place, walked towards the house that accompanied his childhood and youth. Every step was so heavy, every step seemed like a stride towards the abyss.Home was the port in Chen Xi\u2019s heart that could keep out the wind and the rain. Here, he\u2019d listened to his grandfather\u2019s teachings and taken care of his younger brother\u2019s daily life. No matter how exhausted he was every day, so long as he returned home and saw his grandfather and younger brother waiting for him to have a meal, he felt warmth. He felt that the humiliation and ridicule he suffered every day was insignificant.Home, was the place that was impossible to obliterate from Chen Xi\u2019s heart, the wisp of warmth that still remained.Because of this home, he\u2019d shouldered everything since the beginning. He was able to endure being insulted as a jinx and being humiliated by others with the incident of his marriage contract being torn apart. Because, he had to assume the responsibility of this home and support the entire Chen Clan. He desperately cultivated every day precisely because he wanted to defend this home, but now\u2026Not only was his home destroyed, the nearby neighbors and people, an area of 500 km had been transformed into ruins. Countless people had died. White bones lay flat on the streets, it was like an unmarked burial ground, like a bloody hell.\u201cHave you heard, this was done by the Li Clan because they wanted to annihilate the Chen Clan survivors.\u201d\u201cShh! Softly! No one in the entire Pine Mist City dares discuss this topic now because the Li Clan has said that anyone that\u2019s related to Chen Xi, albeit neighbors, will all die a graveless death. Look, the commoners on this area of 500km, and entire 10,000 over people were implicated by Chen Xi and became a ground full of dead bodies and white bones.\u201d\u201cAH! It can\u2019t be! The Zhang general store was destroyed because the owner, Zhang Dayong, had taken care of Chen Xi\u2019s business for many years, but why was that Clear Stream Restaurant destroyed? I heard everyone in the restaurant died tragically within a sea of fire.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know this? That Chen Xi was a spirit chef apprentice in Clear Stream Restaurant for a period of time, how could the Li Clan not destroy it?\u201d\u2026A wave of faint sounds of discussion entered into Chen Xi\u2019s ears. In the distance, two guards in iron armor from the General\u2019s Estate were bent over clearing the corpses in the ruins.It was as if he was struck by lightning, and Chen Xi\u2019s body started trembling without restraint. His face became more and more icy cold, as a starry flame lit ablaze within his gaze that was dead ash. The starry flame grew larger and larger until it transformed into a surging flame with a bang, and it was blazing to the point it seemed as if it would melt the heavens and the earth.His muttering was like a low whistle of the wind, and the aura on Chen Xi\u2019s body had already fully emitted killing intent. The boundless bloody killing intent that he\u2019s condensed from the numerous slaughters in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain and the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range was released with a bang, released without the slightest restraint!At this moment, he was like an undead soul that had walked out of a bloody swamp, icy cold, emotionless, and with killing intent that shot to the skies!He knelt onto the floor and kowtowed three times towards the direction of his home, then got up and left, and he didn\u2019t look back from the beginning until the end.In his heart, there was only the purest, simplest, and most direct thought \u2014 KILL!\u201cHiss, so cold!\u201d\u201cHas the season changed?\u201dThe two guards from the General\u2019s Estate that were clearing the corpses in the ruins seemed as if they\u2019d encountered an assault for a cold stream of air that was bone piercing, and they both shuddered as they looked up in wonder, yet they saw nothing.No one noticed that on the ground in the distance, many crows had died. The blood in their bodies had frozen and their eyes were wide open, yet there wasn\u2019t a single trace of injuries on their bodies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 Storm In The CityPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 95 \u2013 Storm In The CityThe Zhang General Store that was situated on the busiest street of Pine Mist City had transformed into ruins within a single night.Three months had already passed since then.On the busiest street, there were rows upon rows of stores and a bustling crowd, everywhere was so bustling, yet only this place was deathly silent like a grave. So long as pedestrians were to pass by this place, they would surely avoid it from far away, as if they were extremely afraid they would be tainted with a trace of misfortune.This place was still in ruins, and there still was dark red mottled blood stains between the cracks of the shattered roof tiles. This was the blood of the owner of Zhang general goods store and the 37 talisman crafting apprentices. Even though their corpses had already decayed and vanished, the blood was impossible to erase, and it seemed to be narrating the terror, rage, and resentment in their hearts\u2026A merchant brought along a group of tall and strong servants to arrive here, he\u2019d taken a fancy on this plot of land and wanted to build a store on the ruins.\u201cTear it down! I\u2019ve already asked the Li Clan and I\u2019ve spent a great fortune buying this plot of land. In the future, this is the territory of I, Lord Cui. Quickly clear up these ruins and this dirty and smelly blood, and use water and flush it clean for me!\u201d The big-bellied merchant yelled loudly and instructed, yet he noticed that the group of powerful servants behind him had reluctant expressions and were unwilling to step forward, and he couldn\u2019t help but burst into rage. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be worried about? Are all of you afraid of being tainted by the Jinx\u2019s misfortune, or afraid of being dealt with by the Li Clan? Didn\u2019t I fucking say that I\u2019ve already asked the Li Clan?!\u201d\u201cMy Lord, so many people have died here, even if we open a store here, it seems to be unlucky, right? Moreover, the Jinx stayed here for four years, who knows if we will be tainted by his misfortune\u2026\u201d A servant had a bitter expression on his face as he explained.\u201cYeah, presently, everyone in the city that was related to the Jinx has been killed, and even the things he\u2019d used before have been completely burnt by them.\u201d\u201cMy Lord, it\u2019s alright if we don\u2019t take this plot of land!\u201dAll the servants spoke out at once and voiced the worries in their hearts.\u201cDo all of you still want to live or not?\u201d Merchant Cui roared loudly. \u201cGet to work! If you don\u2019t clean up this ruins by tonight, I\u2019ll fucking have the heads of you lowly servants!\u201dThe servants went silent like cicadas in the winter, they could only grit their teeth and walk forward before starting to clean up the Zhang general goods store that had already turned into ruins.Merchant Cui\u2019s expression eased up when he saw this and muttered in disdain. \u201cA group of trash, trash like the Jinx. If I\u2019m a fucking member of the Li Clan, I would kill all of them for daring to disobey me\u2026\u201d\u201cHiss, who\u2019s that fellow. What dense killing intent, it\u2019s simply as if he\u2019d walked out from an ocean of corpses and blood!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Chen Xi! It\u2019s Chen Xi! He\u2026 He\u2019s returned!\u201d\u201cChen Xi? The Jinx?\u201d\u201cShit, I have to quickly avoid him. The Li Clan will probably annihilate my entire family if I have even the slightest relationship with him.\u201dOn the distant street, numerous high-pitched cried suddenly sounded out from the bustling crowd, it was as if they\u2019d seen an inconceivable fierce beast, and their faces all went deathly pale as they fled desperately.Instantly, the entire street was filled with streams of people that cried and shouted as they fled as if they\u2019d encountered something extremely terrifying.\u201cMy Lord, the Jinx has returned!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s quickly flee as well!\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201dAll the servants had long faces, and if it wasn\u2019t for them being afraid of Merchant Cui\u2019s power and influence, they\u2019d probably have fled long ago.\u201cShut up!\u201d Merchant Cui\u2019s expression flickered between a variety of expressions, yet he gritted his teeth and shouted out explosively. \u201cHe\u2019s only trash that just knows how to craft talismans, what are all of you afraid of? Those people fled because they\u2019re afraid of the Li Clan, but I have a close relationship with the Li Clan, is there any need to flee?\u201dDuring the time Merchant Cui was speaking, the streets that were weaved with streams of people had become completely devoid of a single figure, and the stores on both sides of the street closed their doors with a bang, seeming to be avoiding a god of plagues.The atmosphere became deathly silent, strange, and oppressive, as if it was the calm before a storm.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be alarmed, do what you\u2019re supposed to do, you\u2019ll receive an additional ten times of your wages for today!\u201d Merchant Cui took a deep breath before speaking slowly.Money moved the hearts of people, and it was also able to order about the gods and ghosts.When they heard they would receive an additional ten times their wages, although the servants still had extremely unsightly appearances, no one chose to leave. This was exactly the charm of money.Step! Step! Step!A wave of footsteps resounded out in the cold and dreary street, the sound was soft like drifting wind, yet heavy like pounding on drums. Every step smashed onto their hearts, causing their vital energy and blood to surge, and their breathing to become heavy.A tall and thin figure walked over amongst this strange sounds of footsteps that caused one to shudder with fear, His expression was icy cold like an emotionless corpse, yet his eyes were blood red, and his dark red eyes were like the evil spirits and devils of legend.His killing intent was like dense and thick blood that couldn\u2019t be dissolved, like an icy cold sharp blade that had entered the marrow.Whereas he himself was like an unsheathed sharp sword that had been soaked in a sea of blood, yearning to drink fresh blood and souls.Thump!Merchant Cui\u2019s legs went weak and he fell to sit on the ground, the strength within his entire body seemed to have been completely sucked out and it was like a shapeless hand had choked his throat. His eyes sprang wide open as he looked at the approaching figure that possessed monstrous killing intent, and he couldn\u2019t restrain himself from emitting a shrill cry any longer. \u201cChen Xi, you Jinx! What do you want to do? The Li Clan is backing me, you can\u2019t touch me!!\u201dAt the side, all the servants had been scared out of their wits since long ago and collapsed to sit on the floor with shivering mouths, and their expressions were a mix of livid and ashen. Only until they saw that figure did they realize, no matter how much money it was, it couldn\u2019t compare to the value of their lives.Chen Xi paid no attention to them, he only looked at the ruins as the past scenes flashed through his mind.\u2026Two rows of dark red tears of blood silently slid down his face. Chen Xi knelt on the floor, facing the ruins, facing the former Zhang general goods store, facing Uncle Zhang that always encouraged him and helped him, and he heavily kowtowed on the ground.Chen Xi stood up and left without looking back.Whereas at the side, Merchant Cui and all the servants had terrified and hideous expressions as their seven apertures bled, and they died without a sound.There was a talisman drawn by blood on the ground, the first-grade Flamecloud Talisman Chen Xi was most skilled at crafting. The blood colored talisman markings bloomed like a flower, and it seemed to be mourning the souls of the dead within the ruins.Clear Stream Restaurant.On the void and dreary ruins, there were bones, there was blood, and there was Chen Xi wholeheartedly cooking delicious delicacies. He seemed to be muttering something, and broken bits of words like Old Man Ma, Pei Pei, and Qiao Nan could be faintly heard.Ruins, blood, bones, and a person speaking as he cooked food, a scene like this was extremely bizarre and could even be called terrifying.After the time for an incense stick to burn.Four dishes and a jug of wine were placed before the ruins, whereas Chen Xi\u2019s figure wasn\u2019t there any longer.A wild dog smelled the fragrance and run over, but it hadn\u2019t even come close to the extremely delicious food when it abruptly let out a whimper before its body crashed onto the ground, dead on the spot.\u2014\u2014This news seemed to have grown wings and had spread throughout the entire Pine Mist City within the blink of an eye, and it caused the entire city to be stirred.Chen Xi, a Jinx that had grown up in Pine Mist City since a young age, a Jinx whose Clan was annihilated when he was born, then his parents went missing, his marriage contract was torn apart, his grandfather died a miserable death, his younger brother\u2019s right hand was crippled\u2026A few months ago, it was even because of him that the Li Clan annihilated commoners in an area of 500km, annihilated the Zhang general goods store, and annihilated the Clear Stream Restaurant. So long as it was someone that had the slightest relationship with him, they\u2019d all died miserably. How unjust!Presently, this Jinx that was known to every household had returned. Could it be that he wanted to smear the city with a layer of misfortune and blood again?The streets were already devoid of people.The bustling stores had all closed their doors as well.The various institutions had even prohibited all their disciples from going out.The entire city seemed to have become an empty city in the blink of an eye.Even the cultivators that boasted about their strong cultivations were silent and looking on from the sidelines, as they seemed to be already able to see that Chen Xi was bound to die miserably under the butchering knife of the Li Clan today.\u2014\u2014General\u2019s Estate.The number one expert under the command of General Qin, Luo Chong, knitted his brows and was filled with worry.It was at this moment that a guard swiftly ran over, then knelt down on one knee. \u201cReporting to Commander Luo, the General sends words that our General\u2019s Estate will not interfere in this matter.Bang!Luo Chong fiercely slapped his palm onto the nearby table, and wood fragments swirled about.\u201cWe watched idly by as the Li Clan slaughtered over 10,000 commoners, we watched idly by as the Zhang general goods store and Clear Stream Restaurant was annihilated. If this goes on, will the dignity of my General\u2019s Estate still exist? What will we use to convince the masses?\u201d The rage that Luo Chong had accumulated for a few months was unable to be restrained any longer and fully exploded out at this moment. His expression was savage and livid as he roared loudly without stopping. \u201cWhy? Why do we turn a cold shoulder to it? Just because the Li Clan had the support of the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan behind it, so they can trample on the dignity of my General\u2019s Estate?\u201d\u201cLuo Chong, you\u2019re too rash!\u201d An extremely dignified voice sounded out, then a violet robed middle aged man walked over with slow and even steps. He was 3m tall with a back that was straight like a spear, and he seemed like an oppressive tall mountain as he approached, full of dignity. This person was precisely the supreme number one person in the General\u2019s Estate, and the actual ruler of Pine Mist City, Qin Han.\u201cGeneral!\u201d Luo Chong was startled when he saw the violet robed middle aged man, then he took a deep breath before standing up and cupping his hands.\u201cThe Su Clan is extremely terrifying, all those great powers in Dragon Lake City are extremely terrifying. Even though you and I represent the will of the Darchu Dynasty, we can only choose to compromise when facing these ancient clans.\u201d Qin Han sighed. \u201cNot to mention me, even if it\u2019s within Dragon Lake City or the entire southern territory, there isn\u2019t any city\u2019s General\u2019s Estate that dares openly go against them.\u201dLuo Chong knew that what Qin Han said was the truth, yet the rage in his heart increased, and he gnashed his teeth and said, \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with the Li Clan, not the Su Clan!\u201dQin Han shook his head. \u201cDo you think the Li Clan dared be so brazen without the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan supporting them from behind?\u201dLuo Chong said in a daze, \u201cCould it be that we\u2019ll do nothing like this? Watch idly by as Chen Xi is killed? Hongmian\u2019s relationship with him is extremely good.\u201d\u201cI know, so I locked that little girl up.\u201d Qin Han casually replied. \u201cThis is something that can\u2019t be helped. Once Chen Xi is dead, perhaps the entire Pine Mist City would be peaceful. Besides that, offending the Li Clan and Su Clan for a disciple from an impoverished family is undoubtedly burying my General\u2019s Estate into a pit of hell. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\u201cAre great clans and great powers so terrifying?\u201d Luo Chong muttered in powerlessness and dejection.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed so.\u201d Qin Han nodded, yet he didn\u2019t explain any further.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - A Feud Of Blood, Kill! Kill! Kill! (Part 1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 96 - A Feud Of Blood, Kill! Kill! Kill! (Part 1)The Li Clan was situated at the east of Pine Mist City, and it occupied an area of over 600 hectares. Its structure was magnificent and lofty, containing artificial mountains and flowing water, waterside pavilions, and zigzagged walkways were distributed in a well-proportioned manner. At the center was even a lake that occupied an area of 500km. It was a picturesque scene with servants that were numerous like the clouds, and it possessed the atmosphere of a rich and powerful clan.At this moment, within the great hall.It wasn\u2019t Li Yizhen that sat at the host\u2019s seat but it was Li Ming instead.\u201cHow is it? Is there any news from the Su Clan? Didn\u2019t Su Jiao return already? I\u2019ve helped her kill over 10,000 people, could it be that she still won\u2019t agree to marry me?\u201d He was drinking the fine wine in his cup, yet Li Ming\u2019s expression was extremely gloomy, and his entire body possessed a bloody and ruthless aura that caused him to seem extremely fierce.Sweat streamed down the face of Manager Wu who was nearby, and he hurriedly explained. \u201cThe Su Clan is extremely satisfied with our actions. But they said Young Master must acquire a place in the top ten ranks of the Hidden Dragon Rankings next year, and only then would Young Master have the qualifications to marry Miss Su.\u201d\u201cHidden Dragon Rankings?\u201d Li Ming spoke in amazement.In the southern territory\u2019s Dragon Lake City, the eight great sects, six great clans, and three great institutions would join together every 10 years to hold a competition, and they used this to pick the experts in the younger generation that possessed natural talent that swept through all opposition.The entry threshold for the Hidden Dragon Rankings was extremely high, it required that young cultivators must attain the Violet Palace Realm before the age of 30 to possess the qualifications to participate.The young cultivators ranked in the top 100 were able to obtain the reward of a huge amount of medicinal pills and cultivation techniques.Those ranked in the top 50 would even obtain formidable Magic Treasures as their reward.Those ranked in the top 10 already possessed the qualifications to be absorbed into one of the eight great sects, six great clans, or three great institutions to become a core disciple.Those ranked in the top 3 would instead be taken as closed door disciples by great Rebirth Realm cultivators!After all, the entire southern territory possessed a population of tens of billions, and selecting the strongest 100 young experts from this tens of billions of people was a great honor that would tempt anyone.So much so, that even some of the ordinary disciples and core disciples from the eight great sects, six great clans, and three great institutions would participate in the Hidden Dragon Ranking. On one hand, it was to make a name for themselves, on the other hand, it was for the sake of obtaining even more resources or taking some formidable cultivator as their Master.At the same time that the rewards were tempting, the competition was extremely harsh and brutal as well.\u201cYoung Master, with your natural talent, your strength would surely advance a level after a year of bitter cultivating. There is great hope for Young Master to participate in the Hidden Dragon Rankings and rank amongst the top ten.\u201d Manager Wu flattered with a smile.\u201cHmph! There are tens of billions of people in the southern territory, and geniuses are innumerable like a school of carps moving down a river. That Hidden Dragon Ranking competition isn\u2019t as simple as you think.\u201d Li Ming snorted coldly, then spoke arrogantly. \u201cHowever, since the Su Clan has put this request forward, I naturally have to work hard and advance my cultivation. For the sake of Miss Su, I must charge into the top ten of the Hidden Dragon Rankings!\u201d\u201cThis old servant will first congratulate Young Master to win from the very start, greatly display your martial prowess and become famous throughout the world!\u201d Manage Wu let loose a wave of flattery, and it caused Li Ming to raise his head and ceaselessly roar with laughter.\u201cReport! Young Master, Chen Xi has returned! He\u2019s returned!\u201d It was at this moment that a guard ran swiftly into the great hall and cried out loudly.Li Ming swiftly stood up with an expression of wild joy, then he laughed loudly. \u201cGood! Good! Good! This kid has returned at long last. Capturing him and sending him to the Dragon Lake City\u2019s Su Clan would undoubtedly be a great merit!\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s Chen Xi?\u201d asked Manager Wu.\u201cHe\u2026 He\u2019ll be approaching our Li Clan right away!\u201d The guard wiped off the sweat on his forehead and replied while breathing heavily.\u201cHe\u2019s giving himself up?\u201d Manager Wu was stunned, then sneered silently. \u201cHe\u2019s truly courting death. Looks like he\u2019s already noticed that his home has been destroyed and all the people close to him have lost their lives. He wants to trespass into my Li Clan by himself? Perhaps he\u2019s already lost his head to rage, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s doing such a stupid thing, right?\u201d\u201cThis trash isn\u2019t worthy of me making a move myself. Manager Wu, you take along my Li Clan\u2019s elite guards and quickly capture him. Remember, you must not injure him. HAHAHA!\u201d Li Ming waved his hand indifferently, as now that he\u2019d advanced to the Violet Palace Realm, he naturally wouldn\u2019t take Chen Xi seriously.\u2026Before the Li Clan\u2019s front door.Two squads of 1,000 plus black clothed troops were lined up in proper order and wore black armor and white armor respectively. They were created from the most elite disciples of the Li Clan, with a cultivation at least at the Congenital Realm. The highest even possessed a cultivation at the perfection stage of the Congenital Realm.They were the Unicorn Guard and Whitemail Guard that were well renowned within Pine Mist City. At the same time, they were the core strength of the number one clan in Pine Mist City, the Li Clan.At this moment, they held heavy crossbows in their hands and had sabers hanging at their waists. They stood there with solemn and respectful expressions, like two army squadrons that were adept in battle. The cold killing intent from their entire bodies were mixed together, and when seen from afar by an ordinary person, it would cause the person to be scared stiff.The heavy crossbows in their hands was called the Flyingsoul Heavy Crossbow. The arrows were like spears that possessed a range of 500km, and when 1,000 people shot in unison, it was even able to annihilate a Violet Palace Realm cultivator!The sabers that hung at their waists were called Tigerstab. They was made from Dark Steel and were sharp and tough, and could compare to a graded Magic Treasure. When 2,000 people swung their sabers together, they were able to instantly form a Yin-Yang Thousandblade Formation. In the history of the Li Clan, this formation had successfully annihilated invading enemies on many occasions, and the reason was that it was powerful and dominating with extraordinary might.Manager Wu stood with his hands behind his back, and a trace of worry was contained within his heart.At the Spiritcave Lake one year ago, he\u2019d once lead a squad of guards for the sake of offering tributes to the Violet Rhino greater demon, yet he\u2019d unexpectedly encountered Chen Xi. What caused him to be unable to believe it, was that Chen Xi\u2019s Congenital Realm cultivation was actually able to kill the numerous guards like sweeping through dry leaves, and even forced him to have no choice but to flee.Later on, he even heard that the Violet Rhino greater demon was killed by Chen Xi, and from that time onwards, he was even more afraid of Chen Xi\u2019s strength in his heart.Whereas now, one year had already passed.Manager Wu was unable to be sure, but when he saw the two squads of guards with an imposing aura that shot into the sky like a rainbow, the last strand of worry in his heart vanished without a trace.The fully deployed Unicorn Guard and Whitemail Guard was sufficient to annihilate an ordinary Violet Palace Realm cultivator.Step! Step! Step!In this oppressive atmosphere of slaughter, a wave of footsteps resounded out in the desolate street. It was wispy like the wind, heavy like a drum, and it carried along a trace of a strange rhythm that caused one\u2019s heartbeat to be unable to help from speeding up.A tall and thin figure walked out from the shadows. The setting sun that was like blood elongated his shadow to a long length and he was all alone, seeming bleak and lonely.His expression was icy cold and indifferent, with completely dark red eyes that seemed to be filled with blood. Like a pair of torches that were fiercely blazing, they seemed to want to burn, crush, and wipe out everything before him.Hiss! Hiss!The air in the places he passed seemed to be unable to endure the monstrous killing intent in his body, and it violently warped and distorted, causing his figure to become blurry.Manager Wu\u2019s pupils constricted and he couldn\u2019t help but gasp.\u201cLook, it\u2019s really the Jinx!\u201d\u201cHaha! He\u2019s truly courting death. I just recalled how Young Master Li Ming casually said the word a few months ago, and it caused the blood of over 10,000 to flow into a river. Even the General\u2019s Estate didn\u2019t dare make a sound. Truly satisfying!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s indeed courting death. Does he think that he can trespass into our Li Clan by himself? What a pitiable fellow, he\u2019s obviously lost his mind from rage and become an idiot!\u201d\u201cJinx, Jinx, alas, you\u2019ve caused the death of everyone close to you, and now you\u2019re going to bury your own life. With him gone, our lives will lose a type of pleasure.\u201dOn the walls of the Li Clan, there were numerous Li Clan disciples, female attendants and servants watching. They couldn\u2019t help but discuss excitedly when they saw Chen Xi\u2019s figure.Manager Wu restrained his thoughts, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a wave of embarrassment when he thought about his loss of composure earlier. He instantly switched his expression and looked at Chen Xi who was 300m away with a savage expression and laughed arrogantly. \u201cChen Xi, you want to take revenge? It looks to me like you\u2019re giving away your life. HAHAHA!\u201dStep! Step! Step!Chen Xi didn\u2019t speak, moving forward step by step and only the sounds of footsteps resounded.\u201cHmph! Stop acting, obediently allow yourself to be captured and you can still live for a while longer. Otherwise, you\u2019ll surely die today.\u201d Manager Wu\u2019s expression went cold and he shouted out explosively with a stern voice.Chen Xi moved forward indifferently and paid no attention to Manager Wu. Under the setting sun, the shadow behind him grew longer and longer, and it seemed as if hell was at the end of his shadow. Whereas he instead was like a dead soul that had walked out from hell, only possessing killing intent and not knowing how to speak.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d When he saw there was only 150m of distance away, Manager Wu waved his hand, and the squad of over 100 Unicorn Guards moved out fiercely.Swish! Swish! Swish!Over 100 sharp arrows that were thick like a child\u2019s arm shot out explosively from the Flyingsoul Heavy Crossbow, and they covered the heavens and the earth, tearing through the sky as they emitted sounds that seemed as if ghosts were wailing.Clang!At practically the instant the heavy crossbows shot, the 100 plus Unicorn Guard withdrew the Tigerstab Sabers that hung at their waists in unison, then they leaped up to follow the crossbow arrows to charge towards Chen Xi.Shoot the crossbows, draw the saber and charge, a string of movements were completed smoothly in one stretch and were completed in an instant, displaying the extremely ferocious combat attainments of the 100 plus Unicorn Guards.The crossbow arrows were like locusts, seeming like a rain of arrows. There were even 100 plus ferocious Unicorn Guards that gushed over like tidewater, practically fully locking down all of Chen Xi\u2019s paths of retreat.In the eyes of everyone, Chen Xi who still walked forward step by step seemed as if he was scared stiff, and actually didn\u2019t even react in the slightest!This thought had only just flashed within the minds of everyone when they felt something flash before their eyes in the next moment, and Chen Xi\u2019s figure had actually vanished into thin air, completely disappearing!Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!The crossbow arrows that were shot out from the Flyingsoul Heavy Crossbow nailed themselves to the ground, the ferocious and swift energy directly pierced over 100 holes into the ground, and caused fragments of rocks to scatter all over.The hearts of the 100 plus Unicorn Guards that had pounced forward jerked, and they were all stunned.It was at this moment that the over 100 Unicorn Guards noticed, to their terror, that within their field of vision, a wisp of sword light that seemed like an arc of lightning was like a trace of a gale that whistled beneath the sky, breathtaking, beautiful, and chilly, gushing forth as soon as it appeared.Pu! Pu! Pu!Strings of blood were like lit firecrackers, exploding forth all along the way and shooting up into the air, forming a bloody scene.It wasn\u2019t even one tenth of an instant when a bloody hole that was the size of a copper coin had appeared on the throats of 13 Unicorn Guards. Their expressions froze on their faces, and they didn\u2019t understand what had happened even until death.Pu! Pu! Pu!Chen Xi\u2019s figure was like a strand of smoke, like a bolt of lightning, and due to his speed being too swift, he left behind layer upon layer of afterimages in the sky. Whereas the Netherezim Flying Sword in his hand was instead like a wisp of flowing light, accurate and vicious as it harvested lives successively with an extremely swift speed. He was like a farmer that was eliminating weeds in the field, cutting a patch of weeds into half with a single swing of the sickle.At this moment, these Unicorn Guards that charged forward were like a group of goats waiting for slaughter, and it wasn\u2019t that they were too inferior, but their enemy was too strong.A cultivation at the 5th star of the Violet Palace Realm, a complete Wind Dao Insight, and a terrifying strength that was able to battle Golden Palace Realm cultivators, how could these Congenital Realm cultivators be able to withstand him?Moreover, the Netherezim Flying Sword in his hand didn\u2019t fail to live up to the might of a top-grade yellow-rank Magic Treasure. It was sharp and icy cold, and just the icy sword qi that was emitted from it was able to easily crush the Tigerstab sabers in the hands of these Unicorn Guards. In the hands of Chen Xi, it displayed incomparable penetrating ability and sharpness!Flowers of blood scattered into the air, like blood colored fountains that gushed out in unison. In the blink of an eye, another 30 plus Unicorn Guards had their throats pierced and crashed onto the ground.\u201cViolet Palace Realm! But what cultivation in the Martial Dao is this? It\u2019s only been one year, yet this trash\u2019s cultivation has advanced to such a terrifying extent?\u201d In the distance, Manager Wu\u2019s expression became gloomy and his eyes were filled with an expression of disbelief. The 100 plus Unicorn Guards in the distance were already almost about to be slaughtered to the end. He didn\u2019t dare hesitate and abruptly raised his right hand to shout explosively with all his strength. \u201cRelease!\u201dOn the sides, the 1,900 Unicorn Guards and Whitemail Guards had all been prepared since long ago. When they heard this, the Flyingsoul Heavy Crossbows in their hands released in unison, and the crossbow arrows that were like a dense rainstorm shot out explosively!At this moment, Manager Wu had actually disregarded the remaining Unicorn Guards in the distance for the sake of killing Chen Xi!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - A Feud Of Blood, Kill! Kill! Kill! (Part 2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97 - A Feud Of Blood, Kill! Kill! Kill! (Part 2)This year of endless battle in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain and the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range caused Chen Xi to firmly remember an extremely important principle. Never hold back in the slightest when facing an enemy, and killing his enemies in the most precise and swiftest way was always the only law to obtain the final victory.Today, he didn\u2019t hold back indeed.His home was destroyed and everyone was ruthlessly slaughtered within an area of 500km. He\u2019d even implicated the Zhang general goods store and Clear Stream Restaurant to transform into ruins that were covered in mottled blood, and even their corpses and bones didn\u2019t remain.These tragic scenes were like numerous sharp blades that pierced his heart to the point it bled, and even his soul trembled in pain.Since he was young, he\u2019d never felt hatred as he felt today, and the hatred that accumulated and fermented within his belly and chest stimulated him to that point he\u2019d already fallen into a bloodthirsty state.It just so happened that besides the roaring flames of rage that burned within his dark red eyes, there was instead a trace of indifference, an indifference that didn\u2019t contain a bit of emotion.Chen Xi who\u2019s survived countless slaughters and battles not only possessed terrifying combat expertise now, he also possessed an incomparably firm combat will.His indifference and his rage, they were both unable to affect the level of his combat ability, and instead seemed to reflect back at him, causing the level of his combat ability to rise steadily!Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!1,900 crossbow arrows tore through the sky as they shot out violently, the icy cold and hard tips of the arrows slit open the sky. The friction caused scorching sparks that burned the eyes, carrying a string of sharp and ear piercing whistling sounds as they assaulted him.They were like dark clouds that roiled as they pressed forward, covering the heavens and the earth, causing one to be unable to help from feeling the powerless sensation of being unable to avoid them.However, an attack like this was full of flaws to Chen Xi and had no deterrent force at all.When he cultivated the Heavenly Dragon\u2019s Eight Steps to the unity-stage, he was already able to skillfully and easily dodge the attack of a myriad of arrows shot in unison. Now that he\u2019d cultivated the Divine Windwing Flight and his movement technique contained a trace of Wind Dao Insight, not to mention dodging the assault of these crossbow arrows that weren\u2019t even numbering in the 2,000s, even if it was another ten or hundred times more, it would still be unable to touch the corners of his clothes, let alone injure him.Swoosh!In the next moment, Chen Xi had already vanished on the spot.The crossbow arrow assault that was like the rain didn\u2019t come to anything, and it instead directly pierced innumerable bloody holes into the bodies of the remaining Unicorn Guards that had charged forward earlier, and they died utterly tragically.\u201cSet up the formation!\u201d Manager Wu had expected Chen Xi was able to dodge it long ago, so the instant that the Flyingsoul Heavy crossbows were shot, he\u2019d shouted out explosively once again, yet he himself had silently retreated to the back of the group of people.\u201cSwoosh!1,900 people drew their sabers at the same time, yet the sound seemed to have resounded out at the same moment, and it was thunderous to the ear. At the same time, the 900 Unicorn Guards and 1,000 Whitemail Guards moved out suddenly, moving back and forth to interweave together, crisscrossing both horizontally and vertically.In almost an instant, they\u2019d already set up a saber formation with killing intent that shot into the sky. Numerous shiny and sharp Tigerstab sabers pointed towards the sky from afar, and under the setting sun, a layer of a sheen that was like blood appeared on the blades of the sabers.\u201cChen Xi, don\u2019t even think of entering my Li Clan\u2019s door if you don\u2019t defeat this Yin-Yang Thousandblade Formation! Hahaha\u2026\u201d Manager Wu hid behind the tightly shut door and laughed arrogantly, yet his laughter stopped abruptly.At this moment, it was as if someone had choked Manager Wu\u2019s throat, his eyes sprang completely open. As he looked fearfully at the figure that stood before him, he was almost overwhelmed by fear.Swish!A cold light appeared abruptly, Manager Wu didn\u2019t even have the time to cry for help before a bloody hole was directly pierced through on his neck, and even before death, he\u2019d couldn\u2019t imagine how Chen Xi had appeared before him.\u201cAH! Chen Xi has come in!\u201d\u201cManager Wu is dead, he died under Chen Xi\u2019s sword!\u201d\u201cSomeone, hurry! Chen Xi has barged in!\u201d\u2026Behind the door was an open space that occupied an area of 500km. The ground was paved with hard and smooth limestone, and further behind was the numerous alternate pathways that led to the Li Clan's rear residences.At this moment, there were a few tens of servants in the open space, and when they saw Chen Xi wipe off Manager Wu\u2019s life with a single swing of the sword, they were unable to refrain from emitting numerous sharp cries before splitting up to flee.Swish!However, before they could even get far, a flying sword shot out violently, and as if it had grown eyes, it efficiently reaped their lives.Despicable servants that assisted evildoers deserved death!Chen Xi didn\u2019t turn back and directly walked inwards.\u201cEveryone, attack him together and kill this Jinx!\u201d\u201cRight! No matter how formidable he is, he\u2019s only a single person after all!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dAmongst the waves of loud shouting, Li Clan disciples surged over from all directions like tidewater, and they all had ferocious expressions as they swarmed towards Chen Xi.The Unicorn Guards and Whitemail Guards that had formed the Yin-Yang Thousandblade Formation outside the door heard the shouts as well, and they all surged towards the door, yet no matter how they wracked their brains, they were unable to understand how Chen Xi had silently entered the front door.However, with their sight and cultivation realm, it was naturally impossible for them to know how terrifying the speed of a complete Wind Dao Insight combined with the Divine Windwing Flight was.The crowd of people surged like tidewater, these Li Clan disciples all had ferocious expressions, revealing bloodthirst and ruthlessness, and it was sufficient to scare a slightly cowardly person to the point they were overwhelmed with fear.When he saw Chen Xi remaining completely unmoved, the Li Clan disciple that took the lead was first shocked, then he was greatly delighted, shouting at the top of his throat. \u201cBrothers! Kill him! Young Master Li Ming will surely reward us generously!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dA man dies for money and a bird dies for food, for the sake of the imaginary generous reward, these Li Clan disciples became excited, and they all shouted loudly as they charged at Chen Xi.Chen Xi didn\u2019t fly, nor did he flee, and there wasn\u2019t a trace of movement on his face and body, just like the Netherezim Flying Sword in his hand that didn\u2019t shake in the slightest.His wrist shook and the sword lightly struck out.Hiss!A sword light that was coiled with ice appeared in midair, and cold air appeared abruptly!\u201cAH!\u201d Three miserable cries sounded out abruptly. In a single move, three Li Clan disciples had actually been sliced in half at the waist by this sword light, and blood and various internal organs were scattered all over the ground. The three of them didn\u2019t die completely; their upper body still struggled desperately on the ground, and the miserable cries could be heard without end.Even these coldblooded Li Clan disciples couldn\u2019t help but feel their scalps go numb when faced with a scene like this!The few people that were the closest to Chen Xi took a few steps in retreat subconsciously.Then, numerous sword lights that seemed as if they were icy crystals were like innumerable beautiful flowing lights that cut a swift arc to abruptly reap the lives in his surroundings.The Li Clan disciples noticed to their shock that the sword in Chen Xi\u2019s hand was swift to the point it was like a bolt of lightning that was concealed in space, and it slashed out a myriad of surging sword light almost in the blink of an eye. The sword lights that rose one after the other were like misty icy fog, sprinkling a lethal aura that was icy cold and bone piercing, and they were unimaginably sharp. Anything that touched the sword light would be split into two.Batch after batch of Li Clan disciples died miserably and fell to the group. They either had their chest broken open, their throats pierced through, or directly chopped in two by the sword light. The dense dark red blood was like rainwater that splashed out, and the numerous corpses with torn open bellies formed a painting of death that seemed like hell.Chen Xi\u2019s eyes were still completely red like blood, his expression still indifferent like ice, and he was like a soulless puppet. His movements were swift like a ghost and his sword strikes were without a trace of unnecessary movements, precise and ruthless to the point it made one\u2019s hair stand on end. His cultivation realm that was a few times higher allowed him to obtain the largest combat result with every attack.Combat was the best whetstone without a doubt.The regular life and death battles in the Southern Barbaric Nether Domain and the depths of the Southern Barbaric Mountain Range had made all the strength Chen Xi possessed to be tempered to the point it was extremely swift and fierce. Under the combination of the complete Wind Dao Insight and the movement technique, Divine Windwing Flight, his figure was vague to the point it was difficult for one to imagine it, and he was like a strand of smoke that had drifted through the crowd and was difficult to be fathomed.Kill!Kill!Kill!Chen Xi was like a god of death that moved swiftly from place to place, the sharp sword in his hand reaped the lives of batch after batch of Li Clan disciples, and the people able to stand nearby were rapidly reducing.In this battle that was almost a trampling and a slaughter, only ten plus breaths of time had passed when only a sparse few tens of people remained, and only despair and boundless terror could be seen on the faces of everyone.If it was said that they were driven by the generous rewards earlier, now they only saw the dense blood and death. Whereas Chen Xi had already become a ruthless, unfeeling, and madly bloodthirsty devil in their eyes.Pu!A sword light flashed by like lightning, and it brought about a trace of warm dark red blood, and the people within 30 meters of Chen Xi were completely dead.\u201cFlee quickly!\u201dThe remaining Li Clan disciples had completely collapsed, and they turned around to desperately flee in every direction.\u201cTruly a group of trash!\u201d It was at this moment that a cold and tyrannical voice rumbled, and accompanying this voice was a young man with violently fluttering black hair and an expression that was fierce and gloomy flying towards Chen Xi.Chen Xi raised his head and recognized that this figure was Li Ming, the second son of the Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch, Li Yizhen.Swish! Swish! Swish!Eight flying swords shot out explosively. They were like vultures that had smelt blood and swooped towards the Li Clan disciples that were fleeing desperately.\u201cAudacious! You actually dare kill my Li Clan\u2019s disciples in front of me\u2026\u201d Li Ming\u2019s explosive shout hadn\u2019t finished when he saw a string of violently shooting streams of blood one after the other, and thumping sounds could be heard without end. His speed was completely unable to be compared with the speed of the flying swords.In the blink of an eye, those Li Clan disciples that fled in all directions were all dead.The ground was a mess of corpses, bits of flesh, blood, and brightly colored internal organs. The smell of blood that was dense to the point it seemed material suffused the entire heavens and earth, causing one to feel sick from smelling it.The veins on Li Ming\u2019s forehead bulged as a ruthless aura surged and suffused on his body.He\u2019d killed people, even more than a number of people Chen Xi killed at this moment, yet when the people that died were his own clansmen, his heart that has been soaked in blood couldn\u2019t refrain from fiercely twitching. Boundless flames of rage blazed at the bottom of his heart, and it was like lava as it surged throughout his body, stimulating him to the point he almost went mad.\u201cChen Xi, your strength has indeed greatly exceeded my expectations. However, you actually dared slaughter so many of my clansmen, I\u2019ll surely slice you into a thousand pieces and I\u2019ll torture you to death!\u201d Li Ming\u2019s expression was savage and ruthless, his long hair fluttered as lush jade colored flame abruptly surged out from his body, and it was like a dragon arrogantly roaring and a tiger dashing out. At the instant it appeared in the air, the scorching and terrifying flames caused space to shake and warp.\u201cJadeflame Wyrm Transformation Technique!\u201d Within the explosive shout, the Jadeflame wyrm suddenly emitted a roar in the sky in a lifelike way, then it slid through the sky before fiercely clawing with its claws towards Chen Xi who was on the ground.The wyrm constructed from flames was 330m long. It pounced downwards from midair and just its claw was already the same size as Chen Xi. The jade flames on the claw were ghastly, and the gloomy and evil aura on it was extremely dense. The sky was scorched by it to the point it hissed and transformed into white smoke, and the hard limestone floor even softened into mud before shattering piece by piece. Its imposing manner was extremely astonishing.Chen Xi didn\u2019t move. When the wyrm\u2019s claw was about to be a meter from his head, he suddenly raised his right hand and stretched it out, and blasted out a simple and direct Grand Collapsing Fist.Bang!An explosion that was like a muffled thunderclap sounded out, and the sharp claw of the Jadeflame wyrm was instantly blasted into countless tiny balls of flames, then they scattered and fell to the ground.Kacha! Kacha!After the sharp claw shattered, the entire body of the jadeflame wyrm abruptly stiffened in midair, then numerous cracks that were like a spider web appeared on the 330m long body of the jadeflame wyrm, and it was on the verge of completely shattering.The strength of a single punch was powerful to this extent!\u201cDammit! How could this be possible? My Jadeflame Wyrm Transformation Technique is always successful, how could it be utterly defeated by a single punch from a piece of trash?\u201d Li Ming stared his eyes wide open like saucers in midair, and he seemed as if he\u2019d seen an unbelievable scene.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - A Feud Of Blood, Kill! Kill! Kill! (Part 3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98 - A Feud Of Blood, Kill! Kill! Kill! (Part 3)Grand Collapsing Fist!Unlike before, the Grand Collapsing Fist at this moment contained Chen Xi\u2019s True Essence cultivation at the 5th star of the Violet Palace Realm, the complete Wind Dao Insight, and the quality of his True Essence had even been tempered by the rare and valuable cultivation technique, the Ice Crane Technique. It could be said that this simple punch had a force that was more than a hundred times more formidable than before!Whereas although Li Ming had cultivated bitterly to break through to the Violet Palace Realm and could be considered to be one of the top amongst the people of the same age, before the current Chen Xi, his cultivation was even inferior to the Aqua Cavern\u2019s Black Ape King, let alone compare to the Roc King that had comprehended Tidal Dao Insight.\u201cImpossible! How did a piece of trash like you become so formidable? I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d In midair, Li Ming\u2019s expression was brutal and ferocious. Dense jade flames surged and gushed out from his body with an incomparably dense gloomy aura, and it actually shot all the way into the sky to condense into a jade cloud that was a few hectares in size. Atop the jade cloud, a jade green wyrm overlooked all living creatures as it opened its mouth and roared. Instantly, the atmosphere changed, and the spirit energy of heaven and earth within an area of 500km had abruptly become chaotic and dispersed.Pu!Li Ming spat out a mouthful of blood essence and his countenance instantly became extremely ghastly pale. Obviously, executing this move with his cultivation brought extremely great injuries to his body.\u201cChen Xi, you can die without regrets for being able to force me to execute this Jadeflame Heavenly Dragonforce!\u201d Li Ming roared towards the sky, and his finger fiercely pointed towards Chen Xi.Roar!An enraged roar that seemed like the cry of a dragon accompanied Li Ming\u2019s pointing action, and the myriad of jade flames that were the size of washbowls transformed into a myriad of various weapons. There were flying swords, spears, halberds, and tridents. The jade flames were lustrous and filled with dense evil qi as they whistled down from midair like innumerable jade green meteors that swiftly descended.\u201cThe Jadeflame Wyrm Transformation Technique is the ancestral technique of my Li Clan, and the Jadeflame Heavenly Dragonforce is the most formidable move. I absorbed the essence of Whitebone Jadeflame in the Ancestral House during this past year, and my strength had almost been completely emptied by this move. Any Violet Palace Realm cultivator that is touched by this strand of Whitebone Jadeflame would have his soul corroded and incinerated instantly. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s unable to kill this damnable trash!\u201d Li Ming stood in midair and endlessly sneered with a ferocious expression as he gazed at Chen Xi who was on the ground.However, in the next moment, the sneer on his face had frozen abruptly, and his pupils dilated.A typhoon had suddenly appeared in the originally clear and boundless sky, and the terrifying energy simply seemed like it was formed from a myriad of sharp blades that revolved and surged. Wherever it passed, the limestone slabs on the ground were lifted up and transformed into broken bits of powder, and the houses that were as strong as iron were even shattered and crumbled easily, causing stone and wood debris to spray all over the sky.Whereas the myriad of weapons transformed from the jade flames that were whistling in the air as they descended were like bubbles that were instantly crushed to nothingness without the slightest resistance under this typhoon that desired to annihilate the heavens and the earth.Space Shattering Typhoon!The strongest move of the Windflow Divination Sword combined with a complete Wind Dao Insight was something that even a Golden Hall Realm cultivator had to temporarily avoid, how could it be something that Li Ming was able to go against?\u201cNo!\u201d \u00a0When he saw the typhoon\u2019s momentum not reducing in the slightest and sweeping towards him with great might, Li Ming\u2019s had a terrified expression as he emitted a shrill cry. Only at this moment did he realize that there was a gap like a chasm between him and Chen Xi. This was a difference in cultivation, strength, and cultivation in the Martial Dao\u2026 It was a difference in every aspect, an immeasurably vast difference that he was incapable of surmounting.He recalled the Dao Insight Stage that the Grand Elder had mentioned once. At that time, he didn\u2019t understand, but at this moment, as he looked at the typhoon that howled like a dragon, he finally understood the true might of the Dao Insight Stage!He felt himself to be extremely stupid, like an ant that wanted to shake a giant tree. He\u2019d overrated his ability.Li Ming\u2019s thoughts were chaotic as various thoughts intertwined together. At this moment, he actually forgot to dodge, as he was obviously completely frightened by the scene before him, overwhelmed with terror.\u201cStay your hand!\u201d Right at this moment, an explosive shout suddenly sounded out from afar, and accompanying it was a black shadow that shot into the sky. This black shadow was a middle aged man in a luxurious black robe. His expression was dignified, with eyes that were like lightning. He controlled his sword to fly at an extremely swift speed, soaring a distance of a few tens of kilometers in the blink of an eye. He swung his right hand in midair, and a steaming waterfall with a fiery glow surged out violently to collide with Chen Xi\u2019s typhoon. The two of them instantly collided and vanished into nothingness.Swoosh!After executing the Space Shattering Typhoon, Chen Xi seemed to have noticed something since long ago. At the instant the middle aged man in a luxurious robe appeared, the Netherezim Flying Sword in his hand had instantly shot out violently with cold air coiled around it, and it was like a dazzling ice crystal dragon. It slashed out high above in the sky with a powerful and piercingly cold aura, and it was swift like a bolt of lightning.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d The middle aged man was precisely Li Yizhen, the current Patriarch of the Li Clan, and he couldn\u2019t help but burst into rage and grunt coldly when he saw Chen Xi repeatedly using killing moves, as if Chen Xi wanted to completely annihilate him. He fiercely pressed his right hand downwards and a fiery glow that was like a steaming waterfall gushed out once again.Bang! Bang! Bang!The sword qi that seemed like an ice dragon collided with the surging fiery glow. Water and fire don\u2019t mix, and bangs that were like muffled thunder resounded out. For a time, the entire heaven and earth was filled with the deafening sounds of air currents exploding.What caused Li Yizhen to be astounded was that his Fieryglow Air Destruction Palm was actually steadily losing ground and dispersing from the collision, whereas the sword qi that seemed like an ice dragon was completely unharmed and steadily gaining ground, and it was fierce and pure to the point it virtually seemed material!Li Yizhen heart jerked, as his eyesight was exceptionally discerning, and in practically an instant, he\u2019d discerned that Chen Xi cultivation in the Dao of the sword had already attained the Dao Insight Stage. Dense killing intent couldn\u2019t help but arise in his heart.Swish!Right at this moment, the sword qi that was like an ice dragon shattered all the fiery glows that were like a waterfall and slashed right towards his head.However, Li Yizhen\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t slow, and he\u2019d long since seized the time the two moves collided to stretch his hand out and grab Li Ming, then his figure flashed explosively in retreat for 300 meters, barely dodging the sword qi attack.Swoosh!Chen Xi executed his Divine Windwing Flight, flashing up till midair to face Li Yizhen from a distance.\u201cLi Yizhen, you\u2019ve finally appeared.\u201d His icy cold and indifferent voice was so calm, yet when it entered into the ear, it instead seemed to contain monstrous hatred that caused a chill to run down one\u2019s spine.These were the first words Chen Xi spoke since killing his way into the Li Clan. At this instant, the 600 hectares that the Li Clan Estate occupied abruptly fell into a period of unprecedented silence, seeming to have been stunned by the killing intent contained within these words.\u201cA piece of Chen Clan leftover trash like you was actually able to advance to the Violet Palace Realm and comprehend Sword Insight within one year of time has indeed greatly exceeded my expectations.\u201d Li Yizhen\u2019s face was extremely gloomy as he said slowly, \u201cHowever, do you think you\u2019re able to annihilate my Li Clan by yourself? Truly stupid! If you laid in the shadows and bitterly cultivated for a few hundred years, you might still have a chance at succeeding. But\u2026 You\u2019re bound to die today, and your Chen Clan will have no hope of being rebuilt anymore!\u201dLi Ming stared at Chen Xi resentfully, and he gnashed his teeth as he said, \u201cFather, kill him. This fellow\u2019s hands are tainted with the blood of our clansmen. You must slice him into a thousand pieces today, then burn his bones and scatter his ashes!\u201d\u201cClansmen\u2026\u201d Chen Xi muttered, the corners of his mouth curled into an icy cold angle, seeming to be sorrowful yet happy, and numerous bloody scenes roiled and roared in his mind. The ruins of 500km from his home, the ghastly bones, the mottled blood, the Zhang general store and Clear Stream Restaurant that was completely annihilated, and his grandfather\u2019s death!\u201cToday, I\u2019ll take the blood of your Li Clan to hold a memorial for the souls of the dead!\u201d After Chen Xi finished speaking word for word, the aura surrounding his body rose steadily, skyrocketing with a bang, and a terrifying might that contained monstrous hatred mixed within seemed like a sharp sword that wanted to pierce a hole through the sky.At this moment, he didn\u2019t conceal his cultivation any longer. He wanted to completely vent all the humiliation, resentment, and hatred he\u2019d been subjected to for all these ten over years.All of this was because of the Li Clan, and today, even if his life were to end, he would still kill all the members of the Li Clan!Li Yizhen felt suffocated as the terrifying pressure fiercely pressed over from all directions. It felt as if a large mountain had pressed onto his back and a powerless feeling of being unable to resist had suddenly emerged within his heart.Swish!Right at the instant when Li Yizhen\u2019s mind shook intensely, a matchlessly cold flying sword shot out explosively towards him!Li Yizhen was terrified to the point his soul almost came out of his body, and under the stimulation of death, he aroused the True Essence within his entire body to cause a fiery glow to violently surge out from his hands before fiercely slapping it out forward.At practically the same instant, a large brass bell that was earthen yellow had abruptly soared into the sky, and it revolved as it abruptly became as tall as a person before covering him within the brass bell.Li Yizhen secretly heaved a sigh of relief when he finished doing all this. This large brass bell was called the Goldblaze Bell and it was a high-grade yellow-rank defensive Magic Treasure with boundless extraordinary effects. Even if it was a cultivator at the perfection-stage of the Violet Palace Realm, if the cultivator didn\u2019t possess a Magic Treasure with extremely strong offensive properties, it would be difficult for the cultivator to break through this defense.Bang!A string of sounds that were like muffled thunder resounded out, shaking the Goldblaze Bell to the point it droned. The vital energy and blood of Li Yizhen who was within it roiled, and he howled as all the True Essence within his body was poured into the Goldblaze Bell.He couldn\u2019t see everything outside, but he was extremely clear that he would die without a doubt if he left the protection of the Goldblaze Bell. When he thought of this, indescribably astonishment and bitterness couldn\u2019t help but surge out from his heart.\u201cFather\u2026. It was at this moment, the Li Ming\u2019s sharp and miserable voice sounded out abruptly.\u201cMing\u2019er\u2026 I actually only cared about myself and forgot that Ming\u2019er was still outside\u2026\u201d Li Yizhen was frightened out of his wits, and he was just about to remove the Goldblaze Bell and rescue Li Ming when he heard a clear cracking sound, like the sound of a neck being twisted. Up to this point, Li Ming\u2019s miserable and shrill cry stopped abruptly as well.\u201cMing\u2019er is dead?\u201d Li Yizhen\u2019s heart ached, and he was unable to care about anything else and charged out of the Goldblaze Bell like an insane tiger. When he saw Li Ming\u2019s limp corpse held in Chen Xi\u2019s hand, his expression had already become extremely warped and ferocious.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!At the instant that Li Yizhen charged out, Chen Xi had already commanded his Netherezim Flying Swords to form a large net from a myriad of sword qi, and it covered Li Ming\u2019s corpse, instantly mincing his corpse into bits of flesh and blood that drifted down profusely and disorderly from midair.It was as if a continuous and dense rain of blood had poured down, the strand of blood drifted down to drip onto the ground, and the scene was awfully terrifying. Li Yizhen\u2019s heart felt like it was sliced by a myriad of swords when he saw this scene, it ached to the point his face went ghastly pale and he roared into the sky. \u201cYou killed my child\u2026 You killed my child!\u201d\u201cI forgot to tell you, Li Huai was killed by me as well.\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s expression was extremely icy cold and his voice was indifferent and calm, as if he was talking about a trivial and ordinary thing.\u201cHuai\u2019er was killed by you as well?\u201d It was as if lightning struck Li Yizhen, he felt his mind drone and the heaven and earth go dim, and the intense fluctuations in his feelings caused him to be unable to refrain from spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood.Both his sons had died miserably at the hands of Chen Xi, and a blow like this almost caused Li Yizhen\u2019s True Essence to go chaotic and die from his True Essence exploding within his body.\u201cYizhen!\u201d It was at this moment that an explosive shout suddenly sounded out from extremely far in the distance, then sharp sounds of the air tearing apart rose and fell, and the sounds grew louder and louder. Chen Xi was able to see the glow of dusk that was like blood seemed as if it was cut by a blade and six roiling waves of air were squeezed out from within.At practically an instant, six figures had already appeared out of thin air. The one in the lead was a withered old man with greying sideburns, yet the skin on his face was fine and smooth like a baby. Cold lightning seem to shoot out in all directions from his eyes, the True Essence around his body surged like an ocean, and his imposing manner was extremely astonishing.All the five people nearby the old man had deep auras as well, their imposing manners formidable and they displayed extremely formidable cultivations.The instant the six of them appeared, the terrifying aura on their bodies swept out towards the surroundings, causing the space in an area of 500 km to seem as if it was restrained, and it was extremely silent without a shred of the sound of the wind.\u201cElders, Ming\u2019er is dead\u2026 Ming\u2019er is dead!\u201d Li Yizhen noticed the six people and his expression was grieved as he muttered.Shockingly, these people were the six Violet Palace Realm elders of the Li Clan that had always secluded themselves from society, and all their cultivations were at the 7th star of the Violet Palace Realm or above. The Grand Elder, Li Fengtu in the lead had even attained the perfection-stage of the Violet Palace Realm, he was supposedly going to be able to advance to the Golden Hall Realm within three years, and his strength was unfathomable.It was precisely because of these six elders presence that the Li Clan was able to become the number one clan in Pine Mist City. They were the greatest reliance of the Li Clan\u2019s existence!\u201cRest well for a while.\u201d The Grand Elder, Li Fengtu sighed, then he knocked Li Yizhen out with a palm strike before passing him over to a nearby elder. After that, he turned around and his gaze that was like lightning locked onto Chen Xi, exposing killing intent!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - A Feud Of Blood, Kill! Kill! Kill! (Part 4)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99 - A Feud Of Blood, Kill! Kill! Kill! (Part 4)Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!Under the light of dusk, numerous figures dashed towards the Li Clan estate.At this moment, almost everyone in Pine Mist City knew that Chen Xi had returned and charged into the Li Clan Estate by himself. The public that originally thought Chen Xi would die for sure had instead noticed the wave of miserably shrill cries and sounds of explosions that were like muffled thunder that continuously sounded out from the Li Clan Estate\u2026 The battle seemed to have never stopped for a moment.What did this prove?It proved that Chen Xi was still alive, and he was still fighting the entire Li Clan by himself!The fact was extremely bizarre and extremely unbelievable, as it was common knowledge that Chen Xi was only a little apprentice that only knew how to craft talismans a year ago, and his cultivation was only at the Congenital Realm. The Li Clan could exterminate him by casually sending out an expert.But now, a fellow like this had charged into the Li Clan by himself, yet not only did he not die, he was instead continuously fighting. How could this not cause surprise?For the sake of proving the thoughts in their hearts, practically all the Violet Palace Realm cultivators in Pine Mist City had moved out; the General\u2019s Estate, Pine Mist Institution, Skystar Institution, Redleaf institution\u2026They didn\u2019t come to assist Chen Xi, but had instead come purely for the sake of satisfying their curiosity. After all, Chen Xi\u2019s enemy was the Li Clan, and no one would be stupid enough to make an enemy out of the number one power in Pine Mist City, the Li Clan.Not long after, the vicinity of 500km from the Li Clan was already occupied by the Violet Palace Realm cultivators from the various powers. For the sake of not causing a misunderstanding with the Li Clan, they hid themselves in the shadows and used this to indicate their intentions of not interfering.However, when they saw the corpses, flesh, and internal organs that were scattered all over the Li Clan Estate, then saw the profuse blood rain of Li Ming\u2019s corpse that was minced by the sword lights drifting down from midair, their faces were covered in shock.Some people with acute eyesight were even able to vaguely guess Chen Xi\u2019s cultivation based on Chen Xi\u2019s attacks, and for a time, they were shocked speechless in their hearts.When they heard the Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch, Li Yizhen\u2019s, miserable and sorrowful howl, then heard Chen Xi admitting himself that he\u2019d killed Li Huai, the hearts of the spectators fiercely twitched once again.Li Huai, the eldest son of the Li Clan\u2019s Patriarch, was an outstanding figure in the younger generation of the Pine Mist City who possessed a resounding reputation and was exceptionally dazzling. He was an outstanding figure that was even reputed to be the most outstanding genius in the Li Clan for a thousand years.It was precisely such a favored genius that had actually died at the hands of Chen Xi\u2026At this moment, no one dared look down on Chen Xi any longer; they even didn\u2019t dare take him to be the talisman crafting apprentice from one year ago. As for the name of Jinx, all of them even took the initiative to choose to forget it.In the cultivation world, strength was always the standard to measure everything like status, identity, honor\u2026 Nothing wasn\u2019t related to one\u2019s own strength. Even if it was in the sects, clans and institutions, if one wanted to obtain more resources, then one must always possess a strength equal to it. The reactions of all the spectators just happened to prove this.It was at this moment that six figures pushed out six roiling waves of air in the sky atop the Li Clan Estate, and appeared by the side of Li Yizhen who was immersed in the pain of losing his sons.The instant these six people appeared, their terrifying aura that was towering like a mountain suffused out with a bang, and even though there was a large distance separating them, the spectators still felt a heavy pressure.The spectators didn\u2019t dare indulge in any more wild fantasies as they all gazed fixedly at the situation of the battle with unblinking eyes.The Li Clan precisely relied on these six Violet Palace Realm elders to become the number one clan in Pine Mist City. Now, they\u2019d all moved out and made an appearance in public, and an incident like this was difficult to come by in a hundred years. Who wouldn\u2019t want to see exactly how strong their strengths were?Inexplicably, this thought surfaced within the hearts of everyone present in the vicinity.\u2014\u2014Blood flowed like a river on the ground with severed limbs and remains soaking within. There were also some multicolored internal organs floating in it, and the pungent and dense smell of blood couldn\u2019t even be dispersed by the wind.They was the remains of numerous Li Clan disciples that had died miserably.That was the Li Clan\u2019s hope.Presently, they\u2019d all fallen in a pool of blood with miserable expressions, and when such a scene entered into the eyes of Li Fengtu and the other five elders, the gazes they shot at Chen Xi wished for nothing more than to skin and eat the culprit, Chen Xi, alive.\u201cYou\u2019re the leftover trash of the Chen Clan?\u201d Li Fengtu\u2019s voice revealed boundless coldness, and his gaze stared fixedly at Chen Xi with exposed killing intent.Chen Xi didn\u2019t answer him. Eight Netherezim Flying Swords suddenly appeared in his surroundings, they were like a shoal of fish that swam around him. Misty sword lights flickered unsteadily on them, and a strand of sharp and ghastly sword qi shot into the sky.The pupils of Li Fengtu and the other five elders constricted, as they were surprised and doubtful. They were able to utilize eight flying swords at the same time as well, but if they were all top-grade yellow-rank flying swords, then it was uncertain.Cold lights appeared within Li Fengtu\u2019s eyes as he said coldly, \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re so fearless, so it turns out that you possess eight top-grade yellow-rank Magic Treasures.\u201d\u201cBig Brother, kill him and seize these eight swords for the sake of avenging my Li Clan clansmen!\u201d\u201cKill? Wouldn\u2019t that be letting him off too easily? We should skin him alive slice by slice, then extract his soul and cause him to be unable to be reborn forever!\u201dThe other elders at the side spoke with cold voices, their words were filled with dense killing intent.\u201cAll of you want to kill me, and I similarly want to annihilate your Li Clan.\u201d Chen Xi said indifferently, \u201cSince it\u2019s like this, then it won\u2019t end today until one of our sides is annihilated!\u201dLi Fengtu and the others were all dumbstruck as they seemed to have never imagined that Chen Xi would be so audacious.The instant they were dumbstruck, the eight Netherezim Flying Swords surrounding Chen Xi emitted dazzling light before shooting out to kill with a swish. The sword lights of ice condensed into a line, the eight swords forming eight lines, and they coordinated from the beginning until the end, crisscrossing together as they emitted fierce killing intent and flew straight towards Li Fengtu\u2019s head.The force of the sword was fierce and swift!Swift like a bolt of lightning!The first level of the Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation \u2014 Oblivionwind Instakill!At this moment, faced with the joint forces of the six Violet Palace Realm elders, Chen Xi executed the Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation for the first time!Even if this profound-rank sword formation was incomplete, it was still worth 400,000 kgs of spirit liquid in the Treasure Heaven Pavilion, and only a Golden Hall Realm cultivator was able to master this sword formation. This was because it was swift like the wind and flowing lights, peerlessly swift, fierce, and sharp!After it was executed by Chen Xi, the trace of Wind Dao Insight contained within it caused its speed to be swift to the point it already couldn\u2019t be described as stunning.Swish! Hiss! Swish! Hiss!Every time a sword light flashed by, an injury would appear, and the eight Netherezim Flying Swords left behind eight terrifying injuries on Li Fengtu\u2019s body, causing fresh blood to gush out. If it wasn\u2019t for him sensing danger and desperately dodging, this attack alone would have properly taken his aged life.\u201cYou actually dare launch a sneak attack!? Attack!\u201d Li Fengtu\u2019s clothes were stained with blood and he was completely enraged. A flying sword had already appeared in his hand and he sliced in a revolving motion as it shot out explosively.Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!The other five elders swung their sleeves as well, and five dazzling flying sword shot out at almost the exact same instant.Amongst the six Li Clan elders, the elder with the lowest cultivation was at the 7th star of the Violet Palace Realm as well. When they attacked together at this moment, the six flying swords were intertwined together with different trajectories, and they instantly locked all Chen Xi\u2019s paths of retreat. Obviously, they\u2019d trained in a joint formation attack as well.Chen Xi sensed strong danger, and he abruptly urged two of the Netherezim Flying Swords to guard by his side and the other six to transform into six streams of flowing lights that moved to forcefully collide with the six approaching flying swords. A string of explosive sounds of iron colliding sounded out and circle after circle of ripples undulated out, sparks scattered all over the sky from the collision of the flying swords, like a meteor shower.Six enormous bangs sounded out!All 12 of the flying swords were blasted away.The attack of the six Li Clan elders was actually only on par with Chen Xi!The pupils of the numerous pairs of eyes in the distance that were spectating constricted when they saw this scene, and a wisp of shock that couldn\u2019t be concealed flashed within their eyes.Different to these cultivators that were spectating the battle, as the concerned parties, the six Li Clan elders felt it more directly, and their expressions all went grim when they saw Chen Xi wasn\u2019t disadvantaged in the slightest when going one on six against them.Whoosh!Blocking six flying swords with a single attack caused Chen Xi to feel a shortness of breath from the impact, and his vital energy and blood roiled. Chen Xi didn\u2019t dare go head on with them again. He executed his Divine Windwing Flight and his figure swiftly became elusive. He seemed like a strand of wind that had fused into the sky and was fluttering about.With his cultivation at the 5th star of the Violet Palace Realm, if he were to go head on with the joint forces of the six old goats of the Li Clan, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to them. However, if it was a one on one battle, Chen Xi was confident in crushing and killing any one of the six Li Clan elders.After all, the first level of the Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation possessed the might to annihilate an ordinary Golden Hall Realm cultivator!At this moment, Chen Xi wanted to look for an opportunity to annihilate these six people one by one.\u201cHis movement technique is too swift, we should use the Minor Six-Direction Formation to kill him!\u201d Li Fengtu shouted out explosively, then his figure turned to form a watertight defensive formation with the five nearby Li Clan Elders.They stood back to back while facing all directions. When observed from afar, they were like an enormous man with six heads and twelve arms, they moved like the wind, turning and dodging agilely, and the six of them together were actually nimble as if they were a single person.\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dAmongst numerous roars, the six Li Clan elders controlled the six flying swords to slash towards Chen Xi who was like a gust of wind that swam in the sky.For a time, the sky was filled with streams of sword lights that revolved and slashed, flickering with dazzling light as they moved about, and it seemed as if it would tear numerous rifts into the sky.How marvelous was Chen Xi\u2019s Divine Windwing Flight? So long as he wholeheartedly wanted to dodge, then not to mention these six flying swords, even if it was double this amount, he would still be able to easily dodge them.However, Chen Xi\u2019s intention to approach Li Fengtu and the others had instead become extremely difficult. This Minor Six-Direction Formation that was formed by the six of them was like a single person with six eyes, and it guarded against the surroundings without the slightest blind angle, causing any sneak attack to be unable to escape their sights.\u201cHe\u2019s actually able to force these six old fellows to execute the Minor Six-Direction Formation, Chen Xi is indeed too formidable.\u201d\u201cExactly, if it was a one on one battle, I\u2019m afraid no one would be a match for Chen Xi\u2026 I\u2019m truly unable to imagine how he cultivated to such an extent in a year. Using advanced by leaps and bounds isn\u2019t sufficient to describe it.\u201dThe crowd of spectators in the distance started discussing in low voices when they saw the battle that had fallen into a stalemate, and their words were already holding Chen Xi in extreme esteem.In midair, Chen Xi had been moving about all along, and he floated like a strand of smoke yet swift like a bolt of lightning.The six Li Clan elders knew that Chen Xi was looking for their weak point and intended to defeat them one at a time, yet they were helpless against it as Chen Xi\u2019s movement technique was too bizarre, and it was swift to the point that it even surpassed the speed of their flying swords. No matter how they attacked, it would always be extremely nimbly dodged by him, and it was simply like he was formed from a myriad of wind.It wasn\u2019t a good plan for this to continue on.Li Fengtu turned around and caught sight of Li Yizhen awakening, he had a flash of inspiration in his heart right away, and he shouted out explosively. \u201cYizhen! Swiftly turn on the Clan Guarding Grand Formation!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Kill! (End)All the cultivators that were spectating in the distance were shocked when they heard this.In the cultivation world, just like sects which possessed Sect Guarding Grand Formations, every clan which possessed enormous resources would also place an extremely formidable grand formation on their territory, and they would absolutely not utilize it unless it was a life and death moment.At this moment, the Li Clan had actually turned on the Clan Guarding Grand Formation for the sake of annihilating a single person, Chen Xi. A situation like this was simply rarely seen in a thousand years, and it had never occurred in the history of the Li Clan.Whereas this also proved in a different way that Chen Xi, who was completely alone, had already threatened the continuation of the existence of the Li Clan!It was precisely because they realized this that the spectating cultivators in the distance were shocked, and it caused them to reassess Chen Xi\u2019s strength once again.Bang! Bang! Bang!Accompanied by an enormous bang that was like the rumble of thunder, in the sky above the Li Clan that occupied an area of 600 hectares, an immensely enormous screen of light had suddenly arisen. The screen of light was centered on the lake at the center of the Li Clan Estate, held up by four unbroken lengths of walls that were like the pillars of the screen of light, and it seemed like an eggshell that sealed off the entire Li Clan Estate completely.Dark lights revolved and dense jade green flames drifted about on the screen of light, and when looked at from afar, the Li Clan Estate was like a surging and gushing volcano, just that the flames were jade green in color and was suffused with a gloomy aura that caused one\u2019s heart to palpitate in fear.\u201cJade flames locking the sky, this is the Jadeflame Nine-Dragons Formation from a Nether Transformation Realm cultivator of the southern territory 3,000 years ago, that had taken the evil path of cultivation!\u201d\u201cAh! I recall it now. Supposedly, once this formation is formed, it\u2019s impregnable and is able to resist the full force attack of a Nether Transformation Stage cultivator, and only a grandmaster in formations is able to break through it. Moreover, the jade flames that flow atop it are the Jade Phosphorus Flames extracted from the corpses of people that died with resentment, and it\u2019s extremely evil and malicious. If any cultivator were to slightly touch it, it would be as if being possessed by an evil spirit, and the soul would be corroded and devoured in the end!\u201d\u201cLooks like Chen Xi is in danger this time, even if he\u2019s able to kill all of the Li Clan members, I\u2019m afraid it would be difficult for him to walk out from the formation!\u201dThe expressions of the spectators were exceedingly serious. They weren\u2019t worried for Chen Xi, but had instead suddenly noticed that the strength the Li Clan possessed had already greatly exceeded their estimations.\u2014\u2014\u201cChen Xi, you can\u2019t escape. In the Clan Guarding Grand Formation of my Li Clan, it would even be difficult for a Nether Transformation Stage cultivator to escape. Just obediently accept death!\u201d Li Fengtu sneered as he spoke, at the same time, he sped up their attacks, and the six flying swords seemed like a squall that tightly bit onto Chen Xi without letting go.Chen Xi\u2019s figure was like smoke and like wind, and he didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of stopping. However, he didn\u2019t continue locking himself in battle with the six Li Clan elders that had formed the Minor Six-Direction Formation, and instead dashed between the artificial mountains and rivers, flying atop the pavilions and buildings, flying all around the 600 hectare area of the Li Clan Estate.Li Fengtu and the others sneered ceaselessly when they saw Chen Xi fleeing like a confused fly, and their attacks became even swifter and fiercer. The six flying swords shot out explosively to form a rain of swords that covered the sky, and they repeatedly blasted towards Chen Xi.Under this insane blasting that swept away all obstacles, the Li Clan\u2019s pill refinement room, martial training room, treasure pavilion, rear courtyard\u2026 All of them transformed into a pile of ruins.\u201cShit! This little bastard is doing this intentionally. He wants to use our own hands to destroy my Li Clan\u2019s foundation that was built throughout the ages!\u201d One of the elders came to realize the truth, as he suddenly became gloomy and roared ceaselessly.\u201cDammit! We\u2019ve been tricked!\u201d\u201cBut, if we don\u2019t do this, when will we be able to kill this little bastard?\u201dLi Fengtu\u2019s expression was completely livid and his heart was bleeding endlessly. Medicinal pills that were piled into a mountain were stored within the pill refinement room, the book reserve hall contained 10,000 ancient books and records, the treasure pavilion contained spirit materials that had been accumulated for a thousand years\u2026 They were all destroyed!Bang!Another rumble sounded out and a pitch-black and ancient building that was made of stone collapsed with a bang.\u201cThe Ancestral House!\u201d Li Fengtu exclaimed in shock, the veins in his forehead instantly bulged explosively, his face was warped and ferocious, and his chest rose and fell rapidly like a bellows.The Ancestral House that had been built the day the Li Clan was established had now been destroyed by his own hands, and this type of feeling simply felt worse than death.\u201cKill! Kill this little bastard! Cut him into pieces! Burn his bones and scatter his ashes! Pull out his tendons and tear off his skin!\u201d Li Fengtu was completely infuriated, and he gnashed his teeth as he roared fiercely.Swish! Swish! Swish!The flying swords dispersed out and sword qi raged, and the entire heavens and earth were filled with killing intent and sword lights that were like streams. Everywhere they passed, plants transformed into powder, artificial mountains shattered and collapsed, and even the ground was cut open to form enormous ravines that were terrifying, causing dust and dirt to fly into the air.\u201cKill! Although he\u2019s swift at fleeing, a little fellow at the Violet Palace Realm like him is unable to escape the Jadeflame Nine-Dragons Formation, we\u2019ll exhaust him to death if we have to!\u201d Li Fengtu roared once again.\u201cKill!\u201d\u201cKill this little bastard!\u201d\u201cI want to fucking dig out his heart and rip out his lungs, then tear his limbs into pieces!\u201dThe Six Li Clan elders were completely furious, the six flying swords howled in midair as they bombarded Chen Xi\u2019s fleeing figure, and the bombardment didn\u2019t stop for a moment.Chen Xi glanced at the sky as a strand of cold killing intent slipped past his eyes.Bang!A mountain that was coiled in violet gas abruptly flew out from Chen Xi\u2019s hand, revolving as it swiftly emitted a wisp of a billowing violet gas that covered an area of 300m of the heaven and earth.The Copper Colossal Mountain, a semi-finished Magic Treasure, and a marvelous existence with a might comparable to an earth-rank Magic Treasure!The billowing violet gas was the Violetmist Baleful Qi that was able to condense a gravitational field that covered an area of 300m. When one was within the area of the gravitational field, it would feel as if a large mountain was pressed onto one\u2019s shoulder, and one\u2019s pressure would increase explosively.\u201cWhat\u2019s this!?\u201d\u201cShit!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThe six Li Clan Elders were caught off guard. They were all covered within the area of the Violetmist Baleful Qi, causing their figures that were flashing out explosively to become sluggish and tumble down.Swish! Swish! Swish!It was at this moment that the eight Netherezim Flying Swords flew over swiftly, the cold and sharp blades of the swords cooperated with each other to form the Oblivionwind Flowinglight Sword Formation before enveloping three Li Clan elders, and the blades of the swords crisscrossed as they assaulted the three elders, instantly transforming them into three headless corpses.\u201cThird Brother! Fourth Brother! Sixth Brother!\u201d Li Fengtu\u2019s eyes were almost splitting as he exclaimed in sorrow.Furthermore, seizing this gap in their defense, the eight Netherezim Flying Swords didn\u2019t slow down at all to once again reap another two heads. They were about to annihilate Li Fengtu, yet was noticed by him, and he dodged them successively.It had only been the time for an eye to blink from the moment he utilized the Copper Colossal Mountain to annihilating five Li Clan elders, and only Li Fengtu remained by himself on the battlefield. Whereas on the ground, there were instead five headless corpses.Chen Xi grasped the timing of this move to the point it was exceedingly excellent. He\u2019s seized the opportunity of them becoming infuriated, then caused them to be caught off guard by the Copper Colossal Mountain, and the eight Netherezim Flying Swords that had been accumulating force since long ago shot out violently at the same time. All this was connected one after the other and practically happened at the same time, and it was indeed ruthless and resolute. If others were to see this scene, they would probably be terrified by Chen Xi\u2019s extremely meticulous and resolute combat tactics.\u201cI want you dead! I want you dead!\u201d Li Fengtu roared madly, he seemed like an infuriated wild beast as a pearl abruptly appeared in his hand. The pearl was coiled with dark lights and possessed evil qi that shot into the sky, at the instant it appeared, the entire heaven and earth seemed to be covered in a layer of pitch-black sanguinary aura.\u201cDarklight Balefulblood Pearl!\u201d Chen Xi\u2019s eyes squinted as he\u2019d once heard his grandfather mention that the Li Clan had a pearl that possessed the might to obliterate the heaven and the earth, and it was refined from gathering 36 types of extreme Yin baleful blood. A single pearl was sufficient to be comparable to the full force attack of a Golden Core Realm cultivation, and it was extremely terrifying.\u201cDie! You can\u2019t escape while within the Jadeflame Nine-Dragon Formation, and this Darklight Balefulblood Pearl is sufficient to annihilate you a thousand times! My Li Clan is gone, so you have to be buried with it as well! HAHAHA!\u201d Li Fengtu was almost completely mad at this moment, his eyes were filled with ruthless insanity and he raised his hand intending to toss the pearl out. However, right at this instant, he felt his sea of consciousness drone. His soul felt as if it was fiercely smashed by a 150,000kg sledgehammer, and it ached to the point his mind went blank from a short moment.Swish!A sword light flashed by, directly piercing through, then the sword light sliced downwards to completely slice off his right hand that tightly clenched the Darklight Balefulblood Pearl, and it was instantly caught by Chen Xi who flashed over explosively.\u201cUh! Uh!\u201d Li Fengtu held onto his throat, his eyes glaring full of rage at Chen Xi who was beside him, then spoke disjointedly. \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re unable\u2026 To escape.\u201d As soon as he finished speaking, his head tilted and his entire body fell down from midair to smash onto the ground, and blood flowed from his smashed body.Chen Xi descended to the ground, and as he gazed at the Li Clan Estate that was luxurious and elegant before, yet had now transformed into a devastated ruin that was almost 600 hectares in size. Although his mind and body were utterly exhausted, his spirit seemed to have broken through a heavy shackle and obtained release.Bang!Chen Xi knelt on the ground within the pool of blood that was gathered from the Li Clan\u2019s clansmen that had died miserably, and he muttered. \u201cGrandfather, can you see? The entire Li Clan is dead, your grandson has finally taken revenge for the great enmity. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll drag out the culprit that annihilated my Chen Clan, and use their blood to mourn the dead souls of my Chen Clan\u2026\u201dAfter a long time, Chen Xi stood up from the ground, then gazed at the screen of light that covered the sky above him and confined everything. That was the Jadeflame Nine-Dragons Formation, the jade flames that ceaselessly swam about was extracted from the corpses that died with resentment, and was evil and malicious. It was sufficient to withstand the full force attacks of a Nether Transformation Realm expert.Chen Xi lowered his head and a one meter long pitch-black bamboo appeared in his right hand. It faintly emitted a strand of piercingly cold energy of annihilation that was of extreme Yang properties. Shockingly, it was the Seventhgold Swordbamboo.Swoosh!Chen Xi didn\u2019t stay, his figure flashed out, tearing to the air as numerous balls of extremely dazzling arcs of lightning abruptly exploded out from the entire Seventhgold Swordbamboo.Hiss!The shine of lightning flew out along with the stabbing sword that had arcs of lightning revolving on it, and the screen of light was like paper as an enormous hole was easily torn through it.In the world, lightning was of extremely righteous and Yang property, and it specialized in going against filthy and evil things. The Jadeflame Nine-Dragon Formation was condensed from the evil and malicious Jade Phosphorus Flames, and when it encountered the piercingly cold killing intent of lightning, it had undoubtedly encountered its natural enemy.A grand formation that was sufficient to withstand the full force attacks of a Nether Transformation Realm expert was destroyed by Chen Xi with a single sword strike, and he\u2019d escaped from Li Clan\u2019s cage that confined everything. If this wasn\u2019t the will of the heavens, then what was it?As he muttered, Chen Xi flew about in the air above the screen of light, and the force of lightning that surged out from the Seventhgold Swordbamboo was like the sharpest blade in the world. Within the time of a few breaths, he\u2019d already torn apart the screen of light that covered the entire Li Clan into scattered jade flames.\u201cGo!\u201d Chen Xi swung his sleeve, and the myriad of jade flame sparks sprinkled down onto every corner of the 600 hectares of the Li Clan Estate.Bang!The light of flames shot into the sky as the entire Li Clan burnt violently, the jade flames billowed as smoke and mist suffused into the air, and it seemed as if it was telling the story of the countless crimes that had once occurred here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
