PrologueHasan returned home @RainThe 13th disciple of the Grand Hwasan faction.The Three Great Prosecutors' Office.Plum Blossom Screening Chung-Myung ( \u1106\u1162 \u1106\u1162).Heavenly Demon, who threw the world into chaos, fell to rest on the summit of 100,000 mountains.Over a hundred years, come back to life as a child.By the way...What? Is wasan going to fail?What the hell are you talking about?If it's ruined, it's human nature to save it.\"Oh, my God, I'm here. Who cares?\"Plum blossoms always lose.However, when spring comes after a chilly winter, plum blossoms bloom in full bloom again.\"But I'll kill him before he lives again! If you fail, you'll have to do it right, you bastards!\"Chung-Myung's struggle to save the ruined Hawasan faction begins.=======================================Seo ())\"This...\"The teeth are engaged as if they were going to break.How much strength was put into the clenched fist, and dark red blood is flowing out of the palm of the nail.I can't control my twitching body.An anger that seemed to whiten his head overtook him.Red.Everything is red.Everything in sight was colored with dark red blood.The mountain peak, which had been greened by recording only a day ago, was covered with human blood and changed its color in just one day.the fatal shearsNow all that remained here was death.What did you have to bleed for?Chung-Myung raised his hand and grabbed the blade of the sword stuck in his shoulder. The blade of the broken plum sword is pulled out.His body is not normal either.The left arm was torn off and only the sleeves were fluttering, and neither leg was half-cut and could not function properly. But more serious than that was a big hole in his stomach, the size of a child's head.But Chung-Myung didn't feel any pain.Compared to the mental pain that seems to be torn apart, the pain in the body is nothing.\"\u2026\u2026long death sentence.\"In his eyes came the image of the long-length man, Cheon Mun, who had become a disastrous corpse.What was so unfair?What's so unfair, can't I close my eyes even if I die?It is not just the long story.\"Priest...\"The image of Chong Gong, who died with his waist cut in half, is painfully stuck in his eyes.\"Something.\"Everyone is dead.Climbing this mountain together, all the death penalty that had vowed to defend the river and spread the name of Hawasan to the world, went to places where they could not return.All the qualities that followed them up this mountain.Chung-Myung clenched his teeth.It's a noble sacrifice. It's a death that's greater and more consultative.But who dares praise this death?How dare you!Chung-Myung slowly turned his head.I stared at the main culprit who created all this with great hatred.The devil from heaven.A group of evil spirits that have stained the world with blood, the doctrines of the devil.Who the world calls Heavenly Demon.Even in this terrible hellhole, Heavenly Demon seemed more serene. His still standing still in the bloodbath caused strange feelings even to Chung-Myung, who prides himself on hating him the most in the world.No, serenity doesn't suit him right now.For those who have dozens of swords stuck in their whole bodies and two windows piercing their stomachs, there is no such thing as peace.Everyone gave their lives to make that demon look like that.The final death squad consisting of twenty literary factions, including Gu Il-bang, and the elite of the elite. The clash between them all and Heavenly Demon resulted in a co-destruction.Will they be satisfied?Will those who died here be satisfied with this result and close their eyes?It can't be.Even if they were satisfied and pleased, only Chung-Myung could not. All he could do was control his burning hatred and anger.At that moment.Heavenly Demon opened her eyes still.His eyes, transparently empty, stare at Chung-Myung.And his mouth opens slowly.\"\u2026\u2026Hwasan.\"The first thing that came out of his mouth was the two letters \"Hwasan\".Hwasan.The two letters stuck in Chung-Myung's chest like a white man flow out of that demon's mouth.\"I'm sorry to hear that, wasan's student. If I could survive here, I'd be honored for killing me for the rest of my life.\"\"\u2026\u2026shut up.\"\"You can be proud enough. Your sword eventually reached me, although there was help from many. I accept that in the name of Heavenly Demon, your sword, Hawasan's sword, is the best in the world.\"\"Shut up!\"It's hateful to even put the name Hwasan on that cursed mouth.\"That's too bad.\"Heavenly Demon is dying.No matter how much it is, it is the first person who has reached the sky, but it cannot survive only when the Danjeon is penetrated and all the five intestines are cut off.Glow reflection.Now Heavenly Demon is just the last struggle before the end of its life.But why? What makes a dying man so relaxed?Heavenly Demon was an incomprehensible creature that he couldn't understand at all.\"If I had one more day, I would truly be worthy of the name Heavenly Demon. But this, too, must be my destiny.\"Chung-Myung grabbed the blade from his shoulder with all his might. A sharp sharp blade penetrated the palm of the hand, but such a thing is good.One step.Another step.Towards the end of this long and terrible war, Chung-Myung limped towards Heavenly Demon.As Chung-Myung approached, Heavenly Demon's eyes remained colorless and transparent.\"Remember, student of Hawasan. This is not the end. Ma will be back again. And then truly the Mado world will open up. No one can stop it.\u2026.\"Screaming!The sound of the sword cutting through the air resonated at the top of the quiet mountain.Took.Heavenly Demon's neck, which had been cut off, rolled to the floor. Chung-Myung trampled on Heavenly Demon's head, still staring at him with clear eyes.\"This...\"The war is over.The world will remember this war as a triumph for the dead. But Chung-Myung knows. There is no such thing as victory here. No one, no one has ever won.Chung-Myung, who had finally lost strength in his legs, collapsed on the spot. The inevitable death was coming to him, too.Chung-Myung looked up and looked up at the sky.Even though so much blood was flowing and so many people were dying, the sky was still blue enough to be indifferent.What happens to Hawasan now?'Everyone who climbed the Great Mountain to kill Heavenly Demon died. There are people left. Even then, even they will groan at this near-destructive damage.But none of the Moonists was as badly damaged as Hawasan.\"Long death penalty... I told you.\"I told you not to give everything to the consultation.All of Hawasan's celadon ships were buried here.And all the white porcelain boats along the celadon boat died.All that's left is children who don't have power.And...Regret. There was nothing but regret.Was it meaningful?Was the blood that Hawasan shed here really meaningful?\"I don't know. Long death penalty... ...\"Chung-Myung's body slowly fell sideways.His fallen eyes are covered with red blood, white robes, and five-leaf plum blossoms carved on them.Just the death of a no man.The lonely end of closing one's eyes in the absence of a single observer. It is the death of Hawasan, who abandoned his life like a candle using a plum blossom sword he had been holding for his entire life as a tombstone.\"\u2026\u2026but you're better than me.\"There's something to cry about.Because Chung-Myung is crying for them.Chung-Myung's blurred gaze followed Jang Moon-in's figure.'I'm sorry, Long Death.'Wouldn't you have saved one if you were more devoted to nothing?If I hadn't lived a stupid life, listening to my teacher and my death penalty.Would it have been a little different if we had truly won Hawasan's sword, not a false name for nothing?Useless.It is also futile.All that remains is just regret.And there was nothing but worry about the inquest.Plum blossoms always fall.'Also, when a cold winter comes, it blooms again.'Hwasan.'Chung-Myung's consciousness grew distant.The 13th disciple of the Grand Hwasan faction.The Three Great Prosecutors' Office.Plum Blossom Screening Chung-Myung ( \u1106\u1162 \u1106\u1162).After hitting the neck of Heavenly Demon, who threw the world into chaos, he slept at the top of 100,000 mountains.It was one of the few lines he left in the world.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn't know if he was dead, dying, or not.What you see is just the past.A very childhood memory.The way he first entered Hawasan.A landscape where I trained with the death penalty.And it was him who could not adapt to the rigid rules of the door and went out.- You're a doer before you're a doer. You don't know that power without limits is just violence?Obvious nagging.I was sick of it.Therefore, he became a disciple of Hwasan and did not fully follow his teachings. Although his natural talent was so outstanding that he earned the undeserved nickname of plum blossom screening, he was a heretic of Hawasan.Why didn't I know?Even if teaching doesn't fit the bill, even if it all feels boring...Everything about himself came from Hasan. How much I've been in awe of Hwasan.It was a late realization and a late regret.If I had put a little more weight on teaching, and if I could have been a little stronger, I might have changed this terrible ending. If it had been....- Do you regret it?Chung-Myung accepted the softly echoing voice.This is the voice of the death penalty.Long death penalty, his father, his brother, his family, his goal.The one who wanted to follow but couldn't, so he had to turn a blind eye.Yes. I regret it.I regret it. Death penalty- There's nothing to regret.There is a subtle warmth in the voice of the death penalty.But it wasn't Hawaiian.\u2026the death penalty.- One.I think I can hear the death penalty laugh.Endlessly warm, endlessly loving.- Still, it's Hawaiian.'Argh!Still, angry...Like this?Huh? Like this?\"Screaming! Argh!\"I feel a terrible rage in my head.It hurts. It hurts so much.What kind of pain is this? It didn't hurt like this when your arms and legs were cut off.\"\u110e\u1165, Heavenly Demon?\"Isn't he dead?His name instinctively raised both hands and covered his head. If he's not dead yet, we'll have to cut him off again somehow...\u2026.\"What's wrong with you?\"But it wasn't the voice of Heavenly Demon that came back, but the voice of anyone who heard it was chilling and twisted.\"Huh?\"When I open my eyes, I see a strange face.\"You're a beggar, aren't you?\"It's a beggar. It's an open beggar. The knot on the waistline is only one thing. In good words, it is the terminal beggar who is now open to the public, and in bad words, it is the upper beggar among the beggars.A beggar with a grumpy face was looking at Chung-Myung.\"What the hell?\"I don't understand the situation.Chung-Myung tilted his head and glanced at the beggar. The beggar's face starts to turn into irritation after seeing the reaction. It looks really mean.\"Heavenly Demon is freezing to death! This son of a b*tc* is very sleep talking. f*ck you, motherf*cker! Everyone else went begging, but why are you sleeping like that? Didn't I tell you I'd give you a hard time if I showed you one more slack? Is this speaker funny?\"The beggar spun the baton in his hand.Wait a minute.'I mean, that's...\u2026 are you threatening me?'\"Huh?\"A laugh burst out of my mouth.I don't understand the situation, but it doesn't have to be interpreted according to the situation.Who is Chung-Myung?Among the many and many inspections in the world, Chung-Myung is one of the top three. The world praised his sword as the essence of Hawasan's martial arts and praised it as a high epithet of plum blossom inspection.In addition, the horse is no match for him, two of the three other prosecutors. Didn't even the Heavenly Demon acknowledge his sword as the best in the world at the last moment?Even if an open ark comes, he won't be able to raise his head firmly in front of him.But a threat?At risk, fish, fish?\"Huh? Huh? Did you just laugh?\"A beggar looks at him with dumbfounded eyes.\"Hey, speaker.\"\"Hey?\"\"I don't think I understand what's going on, but I'll put it down.\"\"Hahahaha. Hahahaha.\"The beggar began to laugh as if he were absolutely dumbfounded. Chung-Myung also frowned at the sight.How dare you react like that in front of yourself.At that moment, the beggar suddenly hit Chung-Myung on the head with a battagubong.Huh.That's absurd.How dare you do this to me, knowing who I am? I think we need to fix this beggar's habit today.First of all, stop this slow club!Chung-Myung lifted his right arm slowly. For now, grab that club and make the gap in skills...\u2026.\u2026Huh?What?\"Slow?Why are my arms so slow?The club is flying, but Chung-Myung's hands have yet to reach the club.No, I'm sure you should be holding that club the moment you make up your mind. Oh, is the injury not better yet?Then do your best...\u2026.Huh? What's this?Chung-Myung's eyes were wide open.A club is seen flying toward his head in the middle of the view. And a small hand appeared at the end of the vision. A small hand moving toward the club at a slow pace.It's so small and...\u2026.Is it short?What?This can't be short. If it's short, you can't stop it.\u2026.The beggar-wielding club touched Chung-Myung's arm and settled on the top of his head.Coooooooooooooong!I hear thunder in my head.Down.Chung-Myung's body, shocked by the collapse of the world, neatly fell back.Flinch. Flinch.Chung-Myung's body cramps on the floor.Miscellaneous thoughts such as how the situation goes and how to deal with it disappear neatly from my head. All that remained was the pain of heaven and earth opening.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"Chung-Myung rolled around with his head in his hand.It didn't hurt like this when my arm was ripped off by Heavenly Demon!\"You son of a b*tc*!\"The beggar, who hit Chung-Myung on the head, now spat on his hand and started beating him in earnest.\"Find out what's going on, figure it out? I'll make sure you know the situation today! If he's gonna go crazy, he's gonna go crazy! Did you get hot? Falcon is the best medicine in the heat, man!\"The club flamboyantly slaps Chung-Myung's body.\"Argh! Argh! Argh! Are you crazy? Can't quit right now...\u2026. Argh!\"\"Die, die!\"\"Oh, it hurts! Argh!\"Chung-Myung's cry began to change little by little due to the hectic beating.Poof! Poof! Poof!\"You poor thing! I'm going to kill you! I'm going to open a murder today...\u2026.\"\"Open up! Please open up, man!\"\"Argh! Argh! Why can't I block it? Argh!\"Poof! Poof! Poof! Poof!\"Well... moderately...\u2026. No, no! Argh!\"There is no hesitation in the chorus.\"\u2026\u2026Save me\u2026\u2026\"Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!\"Sa, save me. Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God!\"It was Chung-Myung, who was beaten like a dog from the start, as if to suggest that the new life ahead would never be smooth.* * *\"\u2026\u2026Oh, it hurts my pride.\"Chung-Myung grabbed and pulled out the cloth that he had stuck in his nose.\"Ouch, aya.\"I feel a sour pain in my nose. Chung-Myung's face was stained with a sense of emptiness as soon as he saw the dirty cloth.What do you mean nosebleed?It's not even a nosebleed that's bleeding back from internal injuries, it's a nosebleed that's being beaten up!Does this make any sense?It wasn't just nosebleeds. There's not a single place in the whole body.Not to mention the black, blue, bruised eyelids, it felt like there was no intact bone. Have you ever been beaten to the point of rusting like this?I've never been hit like this even though I've been through all kinds of accidents in Hawaii, which boasts strict discipline, and I never thought I'd get that first experience through a street beggar.\"You're going to screw up.\u2026.\"The touch of a beggar wielding a baton smelled like an expert. The beating, which left no part of the body behind, was almost an art form.If it weren't for you, you'd clap for me.\u2026.\"You open-minded bastards. I'll dry the seeds.\"It is simply outrageous now.Chung-Myung, who could not overcome rising fever and irritation, lay down and struggled. But it's just my body that's in pain.\"No, more than that...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung jumped up and approached the stream. And he peered his head forward.I can see a young face that I've never seen before. When Chung-Myung distorted his face, the young man distorted his face, and when Chung-Myung sighed, the young man sighed.\"\u2026\u2026what's going on here?\"Why do you see a young man's face in the water?No, it's not. It'sounds good. It is understandable that the face has changed. Anyway, isn't the younger the better? Too young to be young, but younger than older.Moreover, no matter how much I think about it, this face is more handsome than Chung-Myung's. So it doesn't have much to complain about.The part of the complaint is that the body has become younger together.It's short.His arms and legs are shorter than his original. This is not because the body shape is short by birth, but because it is the body of a child who has not yet grown.In addition, growing up, the momttungeori pijuktto not only not spoken, a bony skeleton. I'm still weak and hungry, so it's hard to raise a hand.Oh, that's right.Anyway!\"So....\"in conclusion\"It means I'm alive.\"I may not be appropriate to say. No matter how much you look at him, he's not Chung-Myung. The old man, who was close to eighty, became a child's body.The plum blossom inspection Chung-Myung is not alive, but the plum blossom inspection Chung-Myung entered the body of a beggar child. It's also with a whole memory.\"The ghost must be in a stately.\"Is this what Buddhism calls reincarnation?If I had known this, I wouldn't have joined Hawasan, I'd have joined Sorim.Chung-Myung, who tried hard to ignore the sudden deepening anxiety, raised his hand and scratched his head.\"Ouch!\"My whole body throbbed as I moved my hands violently. The more I think about it, the more I get angry.\"It won't make a difference if you make a fuss about it.\"It's not a dream, it's not an illusion.I've suspected Heavenly Demon to have done the trick, but if he could do this vivid trick, Heavenly Demon would have already ruled the world.I don't know how, but I have to admit that all this is real anyway.Then, it is very clear what Chung-Myung should do from now on.\"\u2026\u2026\u2026I need to figure out what the hell is going on.\"Chung-Myung, who jumped out of his seat, started running again toward the beggar's den. No, I was going to run.\"Oops.\"Couldn't take a few steps back and sank back into the seat.\"You hit me like a sore thumb, you beggar.\"Chung-Myung's eyes began to burn.\"No matter what the circumstances are, I'm bound to be open.\"Death and survival did not mean that the dirty personality would go anywhere.He soon got back on his feet and waddled and walked to the den.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you catch a dog on a dog day, you won't beat it like that.Didn't those who would have tried to stop Wang Chow somehow not even think about stopping him under the influence of that spirit? So it's normal for a person to be bothered by now...\u2026.\"So you're saying I'm a beggar?\"\"His body is fine, but his head is gone?'The beggar is asking if he's a beggar.Is there another case like this?Obviously this guy is a little weird today. No, it's very strange.I thought I would hit the ground running hard one day because I usually had a feeling of being lazy. I was caught because I was especially unlucky today, but it was similar to how I usually goofed around. If it wasn't today, I would have been beaten once.If you can't eat with your own hands, you'll starve to death or get beaten to death. That's the rule of burrows.Dogs or people come to their senses for a while after being beaten. That's normal.But if it doesn't, it's now in front of course.\"I'm really living in a place like this? That can't be true.\"\"\u2026\u2026no snow?\"\"Huh?\"\"It doesn't seem so hard to figure out what you're wearing.\"Chung-Myung lowered his head. I can see the rags by putting all kinds of cloth together. It was a rag that you wouldn't even know it was clothes if it was thrown away.The average person would nod back at this point, but Chung-Myung didn't know how to give up.\"You don't have a name?\"Gu Chil sighed low.\"Where's the beggar's name? I'll just name it roughly and sing it. You are the first three.\"\"\u2026\u2026it sounds like a beggar's name.\"Look, I'm not feeling very well.\"Of all things, beggars. I can't believe this is happening.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Around the age of sixteen?\"\"How does a beggar know his age?\"\"He does, too.\"There are more than one or two strange things.From the way you talk to the way you behave, everything has changed. I can't believe it's a change caused by a severe blow to the head. Besides, aren't you asking me now that you don't know anything?\"Then what year is it now?\"\"\u2026\u2026I've seen all the beggars who count the days. You want me to be a beggar counting the sun?\"\"You look like a real bum.\"Gu Chil raised his hand and rubbed his eyelids. Being tired and hungry is always a beggar's life, but at this moment, I feel more tired than usual.\"Then let me ask you a question.\"\"\u2026\u2026you've been asking until now.\"\"Do you know Heavenly Demon?\"Gu Chil distorted his eyes.\"What happened to Heavenly Demon earlier, and why is Heavenly Demon suddenly looking for it?\"\"Answer first.\"\"You know, everyone knows Heavenly Demon. It's a pot that died a hundred years ago.\"\"What?\"\"Cannabis...\"At that moment Cho Sam rushed to Gu Chil and grabbed him by the collar.\"Heavenly Demon has been dead for a hundred years? A hundred years? Did you say a hundred years? What?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"I think it's really gone.\"I'm telling you.\"\"It's not a falsehood. It's a lie.\"\"What's the point of lying to you? Good swimmers are no pijuktto. \"Chung-Myung, glaring, soon let go of GuChil's hand by the collar with a look of dismay. Then he suddenly started scratching his head.'Certainly crazy.'That's all I can think of when I look at that face. It seems to be mesmerized, and it seems to be lost in taste. Gu Chil first learned that a person's face can express such a variety of \"flustered\".\"A hundred years?\"\"Do you want me to say it again?\"\"\u2026\u2026it's spinning.\"Chung-Myung looked up with a dejected face.I thought it would comfort me a little if I could see the blue sky, but all I could see was the ceiling of the black hut. It's as gloomy as Chung-Myung's heart now.\"You mean it's been a hundred years?\"Now it's time to get annoyed, Gu Chil bawls.\"Why do you keep repeating what you said? It's been a hundred years! The Jungwon Forest Club faced Heavenly Demon at the top of Mt. 100,000 and eventually slit their necks.\"Yes, Daesan Blood Death is about a hundred years ago!\"\"\u2026\u2026I got it.\"That's driving me crazy.Chung-Myung looked at Gu Chil with a vain face.I don't know if you don't know anything.'The guy who threshed Chung-Myung with excitement a little while ago was the one who opened the door. That means that this guy in front of us is also one step open.Isn't it usually called a hundred thousand degrees of openness?But opening up is not the greatest thing in the world, and you can't feed and put 100,000 Mundo to sleep. Although it is rumored to be a good idea for the topic of beggar breakwater, there is a limit to funding.Most of the 100,000 open roads were just beggars like Gu Chil, which is now on the horizon. Opening up gives these beggars the name of \"no opening\" or \"no knotless beggars\" and treats them appropriately.This means that even beggars who roll around in the author are more knowledgeable about Murim's information than most people.Then, it should be considered to be credible to some extent. There is nothing more to see if you know exactly that the group gathered from each faction at that time was on Daesan Mountain.\"Oh, crazy. A hundred years.\"Five times a river and a mountain is a time of change.Now you have to admit it. That he was reborn by borrowing someone else's body.But...Why don't you let me be born right after I die?'A hundred years later, everyone who knew him would have died. Of course, even if it hadn't been 100 years, most of the people who had known him died in Daesan, but isn't this still different?No matter how unattended Chung-Myung is, he cannot have shared the relationship only with the same fighters. Among those he knew were merchants and Yangmin. But a hundred years later, there's no chance they're alive.I feel like I'm alone in the world.'No matter what happens, it gets tangled up like this. If you do this, then even Hwasan...\u2026.'\"Huh? Wait a minute, wasan!\"Chung-Myung suddenly jumped out of his seat and screamed, and Gu Chil closed his eyes as if he had resigned.Now it's not that surprising.\"Hwasan, what happened to him?\"\"What are you talking about?\"\"What happened to Hwasan?\"\"Hwasan?\"\"Yes!\"\"What is Hwasan?\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"Chung-Myung opened his eyes wide.Don't you know Hwasan? Open beggar?\"Come on, don't mess with me. What's the situation with the Hawasanites?\"\"Hwasan\u1111\u1161?\"Gu Chil tilted his head.You don't know?You don't know?The Hawaiian faction?\"You don't know one of the old file rooms, the Hawasan faction? Hey, this... ...\"\"Old file room? What are you talking about? There's no Hawaiian blue in the old file room.\"\"\u2026\u2026no?\"\"Sorim, shaman, Jongnam, Jeomchang, Gongdong, Cheongseong, ARMY, Haenam, Gonryun. Open. You can open the door like this.\"\"Hae, Haenam, that island chump came in with the old file room? Oh, no, wait a minute, that's not the point. Has Has Hasan fallen out of Gupa?\"Gu Chil sighed softly.'Do I have to call a congressman?'I guess we have to do something about it. It's gone even if it's gone.\"Hwasan, did he miss the old file room? No, let's just say that's possible! But you don't know the Hawasanites? They say rich people can go down for three years! Open beggar doesn't know the Hawasanites?\"If he had the spirit to call the person right in front of him a beggar, he would not starve to death anywhere. Even if I could be beaten to death.Chung-Myung now jumped on Gu Chil, grabbed him by the shoulder and shook him.\"Does this make sense? Does this make sense?\"Gu Chil's head was stripped of its strength.\"You really don't know, Hwasan? You don't know the Hwasanites? Hwasan\u110b\u1173\u11af?\"\"\u2026\u2026Hwasan.\"\"Yes, wasan!\"Gu Chil tilted his head.\"Come to think of it, I heard there was such a cult on the island.\"Chung-Myung's eyes were wide open.\"Yes, on the island, yes island! Hawasan on the island.\"\"As far as I know, it's ruined.\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"I'm out of breath.\"I don't know if there was a Hwasan faction in the old file room, but I think I've heard the story that the famous Hwasan faction was ruined by the war. I don't know exactly. If you want to know more, tell your superiors...\u2026.\"What the hell are you talking about? Is wasan going to fail?Hwasan\u110b\u1175? Hwasan's screwed up?\"What nonsense is this beggar talking about?\"Gu Chil looked up at the ceiling with slightly dampened eyes.Even if you tell me everything you know, the only thing that comes back is swearing. That's why you shouldn't collect black-haired animals.\"No, I don't believe it!\"Chung-Myung pushed Gu Chil and jumped to his feet.\"I'm gonna have to check it out myself!\"Gu Chil screamed as he saw Chung-Myung running outside.\"Hey, if you don't do it properly by evening, Wangchow will kill you! Stop wasting your time and get to work!\"But Chung-Myung walked out without even listening to Gu Chil.\"\u2026\u2026What's wrong with him today?\"Gu Chil, who couldn't understand Chung-Myung who suddenly changed, tilted his head.* * *\"\u2026\u2026Huh.\"Is this the face of a merchant who lost his entire fortune?Chung-Myung's face, sitting in a corner of the street, was filled with despondency.At first, the idea was what Ungae would know if he recognized it.Come to think of it, the power of the literary faction may be tilted because the great disciples and the great disciples of Hwasan were annihilated in the battle, which is now called Daesan Bloodsa.In the meantime, you could be pushed out of the old file room.But no matter how many times I think about it, how could Hwasan, who came to the world, become a beggar in just a hundred years?It sounds like a beggar's door...\u2026.Anyway, this beggar just doesn't know, and others thought they might know Hawasan.But the result was the same no matter who was asked.You mean the mountain on the island?- Hwasan\u1111\u1161? Is there Mufa in Wasan?- I've never heard of such a door group.Who the f*ck is holding a man's sleeve? Do you want to die?Oh, except for the last one.I don't know.No one knows.\"Does this make any sense?\"What kind of literary group is Hwasan?Although there are numerous checkpoints in the world, there are no more famous checkpoints in the world than Hawasan's. It is a little vague to say that it is the most famous inspection in the world, but no one could disagree that it is one of the three most famous literary groups in the world, along with shaman and Namgung Sega.But you don't know?\"Huh....\"This was the most positive response.- Hwasan\u1111\u1161? I think I've heard of it. Isn't that a famous check? Heard you were knocked out by Heavenly Demon? Is it still there?Is that was a disaster?\"What is this sound of a ghost washing up and forgetting.\"Rather, it would be more realistic that the imperial palace caught fire and the emperor fled in the wind.I can't believe he's screwed! Hwasan\u110b\u1175!The last image of the long death penalty glistened in front of me.Jang Moon-haeng, who was always smiling with a gentle face, was down with a bizarre face that was hard to describe.Rather, I'm glad I'm alive again.'If he had survived and heard the wonderful news, he would have vomited blood and died again by now.\"No, no, no!\"Chung-Myung jumped out of his seat.\"I need to see it with my own eyes!\"No matter how low the tide is, it's been around for hundreds of years. I can't believe it until I see it with Chung-Myung's eyes.\"We're going to Hawasan!\"Go, check it out!Chung-Myung's eyes began to burn.It was the moment when a huge event began that would cause a flat wind in the calm river.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Remember the name Chung-Myung of Hawasan, for I will return this favor in the future. I will return this favor to you on the day we meet again.\"That's a very cool thing to say.It would have been great if it wasn't for a poor little beggar with black eyes and chapped lips.Unfortunately, Gu Chil's appreciation of Chung-Myung's wonderful words was very simple.\"...it's bullshit.\"Chung-Myung's face is slightly distorted.\"Of course it sounds strange to me right now, but remember this. Someday this word will change your destiny...\u2026.\"\"Wangcho was looking for you. I'm going to kill him.\"\"Really?\"The two eyes met.\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Khhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\"There are various morons in the world. Just because someone you know joined the ranks doesn't mean it's a big or strange thing.Of course, it's very strange that people suddenly change overnight.\"Anyway, then I'm off!\"\"\u2026\u2026take care of me. Or I'd really beat him to death.\"\"I'm coming, but remember! It is Chung-Myung of Hawasan. Remember this name!\"Chung-Myung turned around and exited the pit with a dignified step.Gu Chil shook his head unconsciously at the sight.Everything happens in my life.That might not be a bad choice either. If Wangcho catches you like that, you'll be beaten to death this time.\"What should I say to Wangcho...\u2026.\"At that moment, the giant slime that was blocking the entrance to the hut was pulled back, and Chung-Myung walked back inside.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Why are you here again?Before Gu Chil even asked, Chung-Myung asked confidently.\"Hey!\"\"Huh?\"\"What's that beggar's name?\"\"Who?\"\"The one who hit me.\"\"Oh... Wangcho? I think it's called Jong Pal.\"\"Jong Pal? It sounds like a beggar. Give it to him. I'm going to kill you next time I see you.\"\u2026will not let it go.The grasshopper.\"Then I'll really go.\"Chung-Myung swirled out again. Chung-Myung comes back inside when he thinks it's a very fiery day.\"Oh, come on!\"\"Hey.\"\"What? Why? What else?\"\"Which way do I have to go to get to Hawasan Island?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"No matter how many times I think about it...\u2026.I'm sure this dude is crazy.* * *Chung-Myung ran and ran.There is no one in the world to take a dirty little beggar to the island. What to believe is strong.\u2026. Two legs and tiredness that seemed to have been strong in the past.The only thing that \u2026 was a heart.Since when has Chung-Myung been riding horses or wagons?In the past, he never rode a horse. He was not so laid back as to move on a slow horse.If he combined all the distances he ran in his previous life, he would be able to circle the midfield ten times. Therefore, he ran to the ground without any doubt.And lay on the floor before just a few.\"Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Oh, my. I'm dying.\"I didn't think it was a child's body.The two steel-like legs were turned into bony sticks, and the heart, which seemed to never tire, was violently protesting against unexpected overwork.What are you talking about?It means that the heart is likely to pop out of the throat.\"No, what kind of body is this?\"What a mess, just a few jumps!Did I run one hour or two! It's just the tip of my tongue and I'm out of breath! How low is the condition of the body to produce this result?\"Yes.\"Looking at his body carefully, he deserved it.Nutrition is too poor before discussing innate qualities. Literally pijuktto not treated properly by a body.You're going to the island with this body?It's a dream story. I was about to die of exhaustion before I arrived in Wasan.The world's plum blossom inspection is so tired of traveling that you die? Even if you meet someone you know in the afterlife, you will be laughed at for three or four days.\"If we're going to the island, we're going to take care of this rotten body first!\"The best way to keep your body healthy?It was already owned by Chung-Myung.\"Huhuhuhuhuh.\"A significant laugh came out of Chung-Myung's mouth. I can't stand it no matter how hard I try.\"Giggling.\"The martial arts are all blown away, the body is at its worst, and Hawasan cannot tell if he is screwed or turned upside down, and is likely to die of hunger.This was the only consolation that made Chung-Myung laugh in this crappy situation.\"So you can learn how to do martial arts from now on.\"You can start over.Others can't even imagine how great this is.Those who didn't make it to the top regret their lives? That, of course, is also true. But even those who reach the top have regrets.If I had done it then!If I had laid the foundations better when I was a little younger!If the master pulled his ear and dragged him away, he would have pretended to train without running away!He stole alcohol hidden by the death penalty and didn't get caught...\u2026.Oh, except for the last one.Anyway!\"I can do it again.\"In the past, Chung-Myung was an inspection of Jigo called the Three Great Prosecutors' Office. But that didn't mean he was happy with his martial arts. Rather, as he became stronger and had a deeper eye for martial arts, he could see better than anyone how inefficiently he trained and how much he had grown in the wrong direction.FoundationMaster, death penalty, cowardly death, that d*mn foundation!\uc218\ub828\uc744 \ud558\ub358 \uc2dc\uc808\uc5d0\ub294 \uadf8 \ub9dd\ud560 \uae30\ucd08\ub860\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc575\ubb34\uc0c8\ucc98\ub7fc \uc678\uccd0 \ub300\ub294 \uae30\ucd08\ub77c\ub294 \ub9d0\uc774 \uc8fd\ub3c4\ub85d \uc9c0\uacb9\uace0 \uc2eb\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc2a4\uc2a4\ub85c \uace0\uc218\uac00 \ub418\uc5b4 \ubcf4\ub2c8 \uc65c \uae30\ucd08\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c\uc9c0\ub97c \uc808\uc2e4\ud558\uac8c \uc774\ud574\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4.The foundation is the foundation after all.A strong ground and a solid foundation are required to build a high tower. How much higher you can climb depends on how hard you work on the foundation.But I don't know that in my childhood. I don't understand no matter how many times I hear it. And even if you understand, you can't do it.Why?'Cause I'm a human being.'I'm digging dirt on the floor to lay the groundwork, and what if the death penalty has already built three stories of towers next to it? Wouldn't anyone be in a hurry.Besides!\"I'll tell you to lay the groundwork, but when you do, you'll only save and praise the ones who go ahead!\"f*cking s*xual orientation!Of course I understand. After all, master is a man, private residence is a man.Everyone knows that it can be successful only when I lay the foundation, but while my disciple is struggling to lay the foundation, the disciple of the death penalty shows amazing swords or goes out to win a friendly arena.That's all right. Master can put up with it somehow. Hwasan is where the Taoists live, and the Taoists are patient.However, as soon as they have a drink with each other that evening, basic training should be considered half-finished.And when someone starts bragging about his student at a drinking party? It's all over.Those who are proud of themselves are bound to wrap their disciples in a list that will never be seen again, and those who have nothing to boast about should hold on by grabbing their thighs. And the irritation and anger all fall on his disciple the next morning.- My priest's disciple has already made two plum blossoms!- I hear the bastard's student has entered the subliminal phase! I've never lost to him! Who's to blame for losing his student farming? This is!- No, no, no, no, no. We're short of power! No, no, no, no, no, no!What kind of basic training is that? I'm busy learning another herbivore right now.This was a chronic disease of the capital faction, in which martial arts were handed down due to priestly relationships.\"However!\"Chung-Myung is different now!Chung-Myung doesn't need to be impatient. There's no teacher who'll push him. I've already seen which way I should walk to go higher, so I just have to go steadily along the path I know.Basic?When others dug the ground and dug the floor, Chung-Myung intended to tear down the mountain and fill the beams to form a plain. On that vast, vast plain, a huge tower that no one has ever built before!'The first time is important.'Hawasan's martial arts is both the Taoist and the Jeonggong.The fistula is slow and weak at first, but it becomes stronger at a rapid pace as you train. If the potter or the mower gives immediate strength as soon as they are mastered, the potter has a weak start, but at the end of it, it has given more depth than other martial arts.To put it simply.It's like rolling a snowball on a snowy mountain.'Roll a small snowball from the top of a snowy mountain. At first, something as big as a nail turns into a fist, and as you roll, it grows exponentially. A small stone becomes a huge avalanche that cannot be stopped by manpower at the end.What Chung-Myung needs to do now is to create a certain rock that can be the center of snowballs. And we must find a mountain side that will never stop rolling.\"Well, then.\"Chung-Myung, who was immediately wrong in the cabal, suddenly looked around.You don't know what's going to happen in the middle of Guandao.Cheung-Myung, who rose nonchalantly, went into the forest. It's a very dangerous thing to make a first power failure. External stimuli should be avoided as much as possible.That may not be the case, but isn't the story of masters who got stung by bees while driving a car a joke?'This should do it.'Chung-Myung, who found the shade of a large tree, repaired the floor and turned his seat on it.\"Well, what do you want me to learn?\"There's a lot of neo-Confucianism in his head. All of Hwasan's Muhak, the history of Hwasan, is with him. There are more than a dozen methods of internal deliberation he knows.Self-deprecating energy that visits the world.The plumage method, which is optimized for plumage examination.The zodiac, which boasts the sharpest energy.The solar energy that contains everything to go up.In addition, he has a number of other tricks in his head that are not enough just to express excellence. If not limited to Hwasan's, the number of tricks you can learn doubles.But Chung-Myung was not worried.It's so obvious what he needs to learn now.\"Meat.\"Chung-Myung's voice rang crystal clear.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's the cheapest martial art in the world, selling for paper or barely getting a bite out of it. It's cheap to put it mildly.When Parakhoes on the streets learn martial arts to become strong people, this is the first book that they buy at the bookstore. This means that those who do not want to abide by the strict rules of conduits and uncrowned are taught to become masters by themselves.In the past, when Chung-Myung was active in Gangho, it was called the Three Great Martial Arts of the Street.When Chung-Myung was called the Three Prosecutors' Office, the basic martial arts on the streets seemed to have changed to taegeukkwon, but that's their job.But why do you learn such cheap martial arts?'Cause it's not cheap.'Yukhap is Hawasan's introductory martial arts. All those who enter Hawasan begin their martial arts with a joint venture.The reason why the joint venture went around the streets was because a Hawaiian investigation boldly opened it to the public under the guise that curing should be for everyone in the world, not just for the conduit.Unfortunately, however, the meat joint does not make a person strong just by learning it. It just has the effect of being a little healthy.Those who did not see the desired effect despised the joint as poor martial arts, and cursed that it was revealed without the core in Hawasan.Eventually, people who had just entered Hawasan found out that the first martial arts they learned were meat joint, and they became so badly recognized that they protested.But Chung-Myung knows.Mussels are never bad martial arts. Had the flesh been as trashy as public perception, it would not dare to retain the position of Hawasan's basic martial arts for hundreds of years.\"Everything has its use.\"The meat joint does not increase the bearing exponentially. No, precisely speaking, the efficiency of gathering internal skills is less than a tenth of the basic balls of civilization.However, the meat combination has a devastating effect to ignore its shortcomings.To purify the body of a person who cooks immediately.To put it simply.\"It's literally a foundation ball.\"Foundationfoundation workMussels are the best martial arts for wiping the Danjeon and the body completely. But when others play football, they only wipe their power plants, so the effect is invisible to the eye.What happens if other people run and just roll the floor?It's a mess.'Eventually, even Hawasan gave up digging deep into the meat joint. Since there is tradition and history, he/she only learned it properly as an introductory ball, and if he/she knew how to play roughly, he/she quickly moved on to a small hearing aid craft.Chung-Myung in his previous life also did not cling to the ineffective meatball. I thought it would be a hundred times more profitable to get better at that time.\"It was a hundred times the loss. d*mn it!\"This is what he regretted most in his previous life.At least twice as strong could have been if he had started another martial arts after completing the joint construction without rushing to other methods.However, it was impossible to rebuild the foundation after building the tower.Then he had the opportunity to resolve his grudge.This time I'm never impatient. I will complete it with great care. To make the tower bigger and more beautiful.\"Hoop.\"Chung-Myung, who turned on the cusp, slowly recalled the composition of the meatball with his eyes closed.The moment you feel like it, your energy moves.Through breathing, the fresh air is sucked into his body. Those who enter the foundation work only spend nearly a month feeling the foreign language for the first time, but Chung-Myung did not need such a process.The energy drawn in slowly travels around his body following the guidance of the meat joint and lands on the edge of his lower stomach.From now on.Of course, Chung-Myung just didn't want to learn the meat joint. It would not be bad to follow the path that the investigators have arranged, but those who have already walked on the same path cannot be satisfied with walking on the same path.A little more gentle.'Concentrate your mind and filter out impurities mixed with the energy gathered.It feels like looking at all the threads of each strand in a huge fabric and filtering out the threads that are slightly out of place, filtering out the energy that is not perfectly pure.The first one is perfect.The size of the energy gathering is meaningless. What he needs now is not the power of impure men, but a perfect grain of energy.I'm losing my energy. The narrower energy was cut smaller and smaller. After more than a half day, all that was left was a grain of energy.The energy settles on the lower abdomen and creates a small space that is embarrassing to call it a Danjeon.It's.Chung-Myung opened his eyes.\"HooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooMy face is covered in sweat. The rags he wore were also stained with sweat and impurities from his body. It used to be dirty, but it means it's even dirtier.\"It's the first time I've worked so hard.\"However, it was rather refreshing than difficult. And I liked the result very much.I patted my lower abdomen still. It's an ambiguous form to call it a power failure, but it's a successful first step towards a perfect foundation.At the moment, it is nothing short of tenuous.Looking through all the history of Kang Ho, no one would have made a weaker power failure than Chung-Myung.But Chung-Myung knows.This little power failure will lead him to another world. This small but complete energy rolls and rolls like a snowball, and it will soon create a huge landslide that no one in the world can stop.Yeah, like....\"Heavenly Demon, like him.\"Chung-Myung's body trembled.I feel a chill in my whole body thinking of Heavenly Demon.I wasn't a human being.'Overwhelming.No, I couldn't put it all into words.A group of people who visit the world are gathered to gather all the elite people. The group did not aim for the entire Magyo. It only jumped on one Heavenly Demon.The result is a sheep-and-dog initiative.To add a little bit of exaggeration, it is no exaggeration to say that he fought equally with the entire strong team alone.'Maybe...'Maybe I can reach it this time.If you do everything you can one by one.Chung-Myung jumped up from his seat.\"Well... ...\"I'm staggering.Chung-Myung's body, which stood half-way, bent forward helplessly.\"Uh...\u2026.\"What is it? Did I work too hard and get anemia?\"Coughing!\"Put strength on your arms and lift yourself up. No, I tried to get it up. But the arm wouldn't listen to him.\"Huh?\"Shaking.I can see the poodle twitching arms as if I had been struck by lightning. It is pathetic to see the thinness of the arms like branches shaking in winter.\"What's wrong with this?\"No? If you worked hard, your body would be too strong...\u2026.\"Come on, hold on.\"Chung-Myung headed to his lower abdomen, his eyes on the floor.The most gentle energy in the world is really gathered like ants.Ant eye booger....Even Chung-Myung, who was a plum blossom inspector, was so cool as to make him happy.\u2026. The amount was miraculously small enough to exhaust a child with a cool fist.Which means?\"No, d*mn it! This won't help you use your body right now!\"Chung-Myung grabbed his head and rolled on the floor.You should have thought about it before you should've made it! Think about it! It's up to you to think. Why aren't you thinking? Why?I think I can hear the long death penalty's voice in my ears.-Please think about it! Thoughts! Why do you think once you've done something? Don't use your head as a hoodie rack and think about it!Chung-Myung's urgent personality, which made the word head and headband come out of the noble master's mouth, felt like an accident once again.If I knew this would happen, I would've made it bigger!\"Do I have to go all the way to Hawaii with this body?\"How far is it from Infinite to Wasan? I mean, roughly.\u2026.\"Lee, Lee Chun-ri?\"My eyes are spinning.Two thousand li?The average man who has not mastered martial arts also finds it difficult to go 100 li a day. Icheon-ri, with their bodies to go? Well, this can't eat pijuktto a child As much as two thousand li?\"Huh!\"Chung-Myung rubbed his face with both hands.\"A rotten life!\"But what can I do? Something that's already been made.In fact, even if I knew, I wouldn't have made a bigger power failure. I realized what kind of obstacle it would be in the future to take a shortcut to make it easier for him.I don't give up the future for the present anymore!It's a problem because \u2026 isn't that simple.\"Turn it off.\"Chung-Myung wailed out of his seat.\"\u2026\u2026What's in life?\"In the end, all of this was nothing but hardship Chung-Myung had to endure.Hardship is how to make a hero!\"There's nothing we can't do with grit!\"Chung-Myung clenched his teeth and began to walk back to the coffin.* * *Splash!\"Turn it off...\"Chung-Myung, whose legs were loosened, fell on the ground.There's something you can't do with grit.'What a new realization at this age.It was Chung-Myung who realized that there was force majeure in the world.I can stand the pain in my leg. I could somehow bear the screaming of my body.But there was one thing I couldn't stand.'I'm starving.'Nothing could solve the hunger of scratching the stomach.In the past, he thought he was used to hunger. Training sometimes requires strict self-restraint. Eating something is an act of accepting external chi, but naturally you accept impure things.Therefore, those who perform strictly prohibit formalities. In the midst of the hard training, there was even a very cutting job. Chung-Myung was also a student of the Taoist Huasan, who was immune to hunger.No, I thought he was.But Chung-Myung didn't know.What a big difference between what you can't do without it and what you can't do even if you have it!There was a difference between heaven and earth between enduring even if there was food and starving because there was nothing to eat. Extreme hunger is not overcome by patience. I felt like Madu guys were cutting in the boat.With terrible grit, he somehow succeeded in getting out of the coffin and entering the castle, but he had no energy to do anything more. We almost crawled all the way to that way.'The first death crisis I've ever experienced in my life is starving to death.'It's a ridiculous.Who is Chung-Myung?Three generations in the world... Oh, I'm tired of it. I'm starving.Cheung-Myung groaned, feeling that the word \"damage\" had become a real threat, not just a modifier.I'm not kidding, I'm really going to starve to death.I tried to catch a mountain animal, but it was impossible to run and move properly how well he tapped his body.No, the body was on the verge of starvation from the start of Infinite. Maybe he starved to death once already.And now for the second time, I'm on the verge of starvation.What should I do?'You have to have money to get food, and you have to work to make money. But it was impossible to work with this body.Then what the hell...It was that moment.Jjiggle.The sound of iron from somewhere rang clear.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then I see something shiny in front of me.'Huh?'At the same time, I heard the sound of a tongue kick.\"Tsk, tsk. I think you're still young. How did you end up a beggar?\"Jjiggle.Jjiggle.Coins are starting to fly in.\"I think I've been beaten somewhere, but I don't know if he's going to die.\"\"The world is dizzy. Tsk tsk. Poor thing.\"What?What kind of situation is this...\u2026.'Ah.'I'm a beggar, aren't I? I forgot for a second.In the eyes of others, Chung-Myung would appear to be a beggar. No, it was just a beggar in its own eyes. That's a young man who hasn't become an adult yet. It's also a pitiful thing to be beaten to death and your eyes turned blue and your blood clots stuck together...\u2026.Such a beggar is lying on the street.\"Oh, I can't stand it without your help.\"\"People can't just go. If it's a person.\"The young beggar, whose arms and legs have also grown less, is wearing rags, and is dying of dust. It's not just dying, it's really dying.Where do you mean there's a more perfect begging?Maybe that's why coins are jingling.\"Tsk, tsk.\"\"I've never seen you before. How did you get here?\"I guess the world is still worth living.Those heading to the war were kicking their tongues and tossing coins to him. Clear tears flowed down Chung-Myung's eyes as he looked at the flying coin.\"It's crying. It's crying. It's pathetic.\"\"Buy some noodles with it.\"Warmheartedness was pouring in. But the reason why Chung-Myung is shedding tears is not because he is thrilled by the situation.I'm a student of the great Hawaiian faction and I'm begging.'How did you end up here?Until just a few days ago, he was the world's best prosecutor to fight Heavenly Demon at the risk of the world's And before that, he was an elegant swordsman who was discussing the world throughout the world.But now he's in a position to beg. It's all about oil!People have pride!'He's a real bum if he gets this money. What a beggar he was, a noble prosecutor of the great Hawaiian faction. Begging! This is totally out of the question.A warrior never gives up his pride even if he has a knife in his neck!Chung-Myung, who raised his head, clenched his teeth and shouted!\"Thank you! You'll be blessed, interpersonal!\"Pride freezes to death.I'll live and see.* * *\"Boooooops!Chung-Myung tapped on the bulging belly. As only his belly was bulging with a skinny body, he looked like a tadpole.\"Pride, feed, feed, feed. A dead warrior. A better beggar than a dead warrior.\"The efficiency is good because the body is small.Three dumplings bought in Nanjeon were enough to make my stomach explode. And yet there were still three jingling coins on the sleeve.In the past, coins that would have passed by without picking them up even if they were apart on the street felt like treasures that are now unprecedented.'I never thought money would be this important.'I remember watching the death penalty, which was holding my head every month on the settlement day, and talking about the governor's obsession with wealth. If I could, I'd like to go back to that time and smash the desired muzzle.I was full.'A man who can't make any money is talking about cutting. I'm about to cry at the thought of the long death penalty, which must have been bent to feed the half-employed who were useless for nothing.Anyway.\"I've lived for a while.\"Chung-Myung scratched his head.Although we started without countermeasures, we have no idea how to get to the island.'I thought it was easy.'All of Chung-Myung's ideas revolve around the past. Knowing that the body has changed and the situation has changed, it was not easy to adapt to the new standards overnight.In the past, he would have gone from infinite to island in half a day and had a cool drink in the inn under the Hawaiian, but now going bare-handed with his body was really a risk.No matter how mountaineers or mountain animals can be destroyed, hunger is no answer.My head became complicated when the journey, which I thought could be made simple, turned into a grand journey to risk my life.\"But you can't take your time begging and go to the island.\"Chung-Myung scratched his head wildly.\"I have to find a way, but I need to know something to find a way!\"It's not as if it used to be. It was a hundred years later now. It is no exaggeration to say that I have no idea how things work out in the world. But what's the way to find it?\"Hey!\"It takes more than two months for ordinary people to get to the island. It doesn't take half a year to get to Hawasan with this body.\"Hey!\"It was frustrating for Chung-Myung, who had to see what happened to Hwasan right now. I have to find a way, but what comes to mind now is...\u2026.\"Hey, you son of a b*tc*! Are you deaf?\"\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung turned his head.What is it?I thought I could hear something, but I didn't know it was calling me. There's no one to talk to a beggar.Three beggars staring at this side with ugly faces came into view.That's a bummer, isn't it's a bummer.'This life seems to be tied up with beggars in many ways.\"Me?\"\"Me? Not me, but me? What the f*ck is wrong with you?\"The scurrilous beggar in front of him spat on the floor.\"I don't know where he crawled from, but who allowed him to beg here?\"Do you need permission to beg?\"You're still young, so I'll spare your life. Take out everything in your hand and sleeve and go away.\"If it's in the sleeve, you're talking about the remaining coins. If it's in your hand...\u2026.Chung-Myung's eyes turned to his hands. There was a cold dumpling half way left.\"\u2026\u2026you really have no conscience. You bastards.\"Take this away? This? I'll eat the liver of a flea!\"You son of a b*tc*!\"There was nothing but a beggar and a beggar to swear at each other. As a result, when I curse at others, I feel like I'm spitting on my face.\u2026. Cut the crap!\"Wait a minute.\"Chung-Myung put the dumplings on the side nicely.Then, he stood up, stretched his hand forward a couple of times, and repeated the action of taking a step forward and taking a step back several times.The beggars who were watching the scene glared.\"What are you doing?\"\"Oh, wait a minute. It'll be over soon.\"Chung-Myung, who stretched his arms and legs a few more times, nodded and turned around.\"It's not perfect yet, but it should be rough.\"Now I've learned the sense of distance. I've adjusted to the short arms and legs.So!\"You guys must be very upset, but I have very bad feelings for the beggar.\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"\"What can I do? That's the way it is. Don't be upset and take it sweetly.\"\"What is he talking about?\"Chung-Myung broke his neck a couple times.\"Oh, for your information, I can't hit hard because my body is weak. So you're gonna have to get hit a lot.\"\"This is the real beauty...\u2026.\"At that moment, Chung-Myung ran forward like a guard and hit the face of the beggar in front of him.Argh! Argh!A proper step. The force created by the gentle rotation of the bent waist is perfectly loaded at the end of the fist. The child's fist punched a person in the face, and there was a sound of a punch with a palm-print.Flop.The beggar, who was beaten by a blow that he couldn't handle, fell on the spot without making a sound.Chung-Myung trembled at the sight.\"I am!\"Gasp!A kick from the side hits another beggar.\"A plum blossom inspection of the great Hawaiian faction! You bastards! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"It was the moment when the anger piled up and exploded after reincarnation.* * *\"\u2026\u2026Adult.\"\"Who says you're a beggar?\"\"Large\u2026\u2026?\"\"Do you want to die?\"The beggars with their heads down groaned.\"Where did this monstrous creature come from?'I'm dying of pain.'It took Chung-Myung only a cup of tea to subdue the beggars. It would be surprising if it took a child to knock down three healthy adults, but by Chung-Myung's standards, it was also a very miserable result.'You're going to end up with a vase.'It doesn't take much effort to subdue these guys. If it was his body in the past, he would have made rice cake with one finger even without experience.But now he had to run and roll even when overpowering them. He kept getting up after hitting him once, so he was screaming after hitting his eyelids 38 times.I should've beaten up Jong Pal or Jo Pal.'I shudder when I think of him.I just wish I knew you had short arms and legs! If I had the strength to hold on, I could have beaten him like a dog!I was in a hurry to go to Hawaii, so I left without revenge, but one day I'll catch the beggar like a mouse.\"Wake up.\"\"Yes!\"Three beggars jumped to their feet. Sweat dripped down their dirty faces. All three of them read Chung-Myung's countenance.I can't not eating, baby. ' I see every prospect of pijuktto''This doesn't make sense.'It was completely incomprehensible.It is small, weak and thin.On the surface, if you fall while walking, you will go straight to Hwangcheon. But when I got closer to him, there was no ghost. Their fists couldn't even touch that young beggar's clothes.I don't understand why such a result came out even though it's not that fast or strong.\"Hey.\"\"Yes!\"\"Give me your name! No, it's a giant! Oh, no....\"What's the point of understanding? The thought is far and the fist is near. What's important is that the young beggar's fist hurts to the bone.Chung-Myung looked back at the beggars and opened his mouth.\"Just in case, do you know how to get to your island quickly?\"The beggars looked back at each other and grinned. Chung-Myung, who saw his confident smile, had a ray of expectation.\"Hahaha, you're asking me something obvious.\"\"Oh, you know?\"\"If we knew something like that, we wouldn't be beggars. You have to ask where you want to ask questions.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung sighed as he looked at the beggars in a shuddering manner.There's nothing wrong with these guys. Now he's in the wrong place to ask beggars for a way.\"Okay, go ahead.\"\"Thank you!\"\"Have a long, long life!\"The beggars bowed their backs violently and turned quickly to run away. No, I tried to run away.\"Wait a minute.At that moment, Chung-Myung's voice caught them.\"Yes?\"\"It's good to go, but I'll take out what's in my hand and in my pocket.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"When you come out of the background, a coin and a punch...\u2026. No, ten. It won't hurt if I give him a punch.\"Realizing that he meant it, the beggars gave Chung-Myung coins in their pockets with resigned faces.\"Hey, you.\"\"Yes?\"\"Take out what's inside. Before you take it off.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"It was a terrible scene where a beggar was mugged and could not be seen with eyes open.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His eyes finally caught the grandeur of Hawasan.\"Finally, uh-uh!\"\"I'm tearing up.How hard did it take to get here? He passed the critical point of death again and again, leading the body of a child who was no better than a normal person, or worse than a normal person.Of course, it was a little different from the crisis most people face on the road. It was generally the threat of Asana exhaustion. But it's dangerous, isn't it?Anyway, through the terrible hardship, Chung-Myung finally reached Wasan.\"\u2026\u2026it was long.\"If you start having a hard time coming here, you will get a hero epic. No, it was about to be a beggar.So, of course, Chung-Myung's look wasn't human.Although I gained energy by learning martial arts, all the energy that I had to use to recover my body was spent walking and running, so my body became weaker rather than stronger.How skin and bones are so thin that each viewer frowns.At first, the clothes, which were in the shape of rags, were now called something that had a form of cloth or something. What about the dust that sticks to dust.But that's not what's important.The important thing is that Chung-Myung has finally arrived in Wasan.Chung-Myung stole the eye without realizing it.I'm going to break the heads of those guys who said they'd be better off if they were born again.'It is also important who you are born again.If I was reborn as a beggar with no parents and no houses, I would have never been reborn.But this is the end of all hardships! We've finally arrived in Wasan! So now you have to check it out with your own eyes. What the hell happened to wasan.\"Go up!\"Chung-Myung vigorously grabbed a cane and began climbing the Hwasan.And after a while.\"Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Gasp!\"Clinging to the slope of the cliff, Chung-Myung breathed heavily as if his lungs were sticking out.\"What conduit?\"You're on top of a mountain! On a mountain like this! Does it make sense to build a conduit on a mountain like this without going crazy?No wonder, there are so many incense-burning visitors in Sori and Wudang, but I couldn't find anyone in Wasan even though I washed my eyes and looked for it.Chung-Myung sneaked his head down and looked down. A distant cliff with no end in sight catches his eye.Don't exaggerate?It's an obvious fact. It is not to the extent that the end is invisible. Because there's a cloud under him now! This crazy mountain was high enough to climb through the clouds, and the only way up was a small cow on a vertically stretched cliff.No, it's not even a cow.If you call this road, sparrows are phoenixes.You can't even step on both feet at the same time, so you have to stick your back to a cliff and walk on a crabbed path. Can you call it a road?\"What the hell were you thinking of building a conduit on a mountain like this?\"As soon as I arrived in Hawasan, I wanted to run to the investigation and point fingers, but Chung-Myung was not qualified either.- Capital punishment. Doesn't it seem like Hawasan is qualified as a check-up? Isn't that towering peak simply the shape of a sword? The investigator seems to have settled in a very good place.\"...it's a load of shit.\"What, does the peak look like a sword?It's like a sword. It's like a sword. It's so sword-like that the way up the peak seems to be going up the blade.I heard that Hawasan's mountain range is the best in the Oak. It was Chung-Myung who desperately felt what the word meant only when he was unable to use martial arts.\"This is killing me.\"I'm not kidding, I'm really risking my life. Arms and legs have already begun to tremble, and there is still a long way to climb.Sighing that there were not many people who were introduced to the school, I could realize how wrong the conduit was, Hwasan.\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung groaned and clung close to the wall.But you can't give up here! Come all the way here and give up? It's human's job to climb a mountain if it's there! Rise and fall with grit and courage!\u2026\u2026it's actually more dangerous to go down now.\u2026really.* * *My chin!Hands rose from the edge of the cliff.Shaking hands grab onto the cliff.\"Turn it off!\"The white fingertips are pathetic. The hand with close strength pulls the body up.\"Oh, my God!\"Chung-Myung, who barely pulled himself up, fell on the floor and lay down.\"Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Gasped!\"As I turn my head, I can see the clouds underneath.I wanted to compliment myself for thinking that I came this far with this child's body.It didn't come off well. It didn't even fall off.Chung-Myung, who had been looking up at the sky for a long time, struggled to get up again. The good news is that we don't have to go down this monstrous mountain again.All that remains is to bury the bones in Hawasan.Let's see.Chung-Myung, who rose up, looked around. I think it was around here.A hillway leading to the summit was visible in the front. Just a short walk up that road and you'll see Hawasan. Chung-Myung's legs began to move slowly.My heart was moved by the fact that I had come this far. It wasn't until a hundred years later that he finally arrived in Wasan.\"\u2026\u2026 of course, it's been almost a month since I actually.\"Let's just say it's been 100 years since we arrived. Because it's cooler.Climbing the hill was not hard enough to lie a little. The body was completely exhausted, but the thought of reaching Hawasan seemed to give me up.\"Ahhhhhaha.Chung-Myung's eyes were filled with faintness as tiles at the main gate of Hawasan began to be seen far away.Over the years, it was time for the rivers and mountains to change five times, but the tiles he saw remained unchanged. That gentle curve still contains Hawasan's unwavering energy in its tenderness.Yeah, on that old, tiled eaves...\u2026.Yes?Is it old?The roof tiles are coming off?Chung-Myung rubbed his eyes with his sleeve.Did I see it wrong?However, no matter how much you rub your eyes, the scenery in front of you does not change. As I took one step closer, I could see the half-broken main gate more clearly.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Lost for words, Chung-Myung stopped walking.The main gate is the first place that visitors to the gate see. Therefore, the main gate is as grand and tidy as possible, even if each gate is moderately decorated inside.So did the former was Hwasan.Although it was not possible to make it colorful due to the characteristics of the simple and simple door, it was at least made strong and grand enough to feel the spirit of Hawasan. And I tried to keep it neat and tidy.By the way...What am I looking at?'I can understand that the tiles are separated in places and the teeth are chipped out. Tiled tiles are bound to go bad, and when the time comes, you have to change them appropriately.But a cracked, peeling post and a black, rotten door! Besides!'Well, the spider web...\u2026.'Others are things that need to be repaired frequently, so you can understand them somehow. However, it was beyond my understanding that the web was hanging on each eaves, and that it was not even being removed.And the finishing touch...\u2026.\"Where's the signboard? Hyeonpan!\"Isn't signboard the most important thing that symbolizes the literary circle? Where the hell did it go?The signboard, which read \"The Great Hawasan faction\" in the handwriting of a warrior's tombstone, was nowhere to be found.That's what our long-running brother used to go up every morning and wipe it! Where'd it go? That one!Chung-Myung's legs began to lose strength. Chung-Myung, barely walking to the front of the main gate, lost his words and gazed at the main gate of Hwasan.As far as I know, it's ruined.- Hwasan\u1111\u1161? I think I've heard of it. Wasn't that a famous check? Heard you were knocked out by Heavenly Demon? Is it still there?\"...it's ruined?\"Hwasan\u110b\u1175?Chung-Myung's eyes trembled.\"No, what the f*ck are you talking about?\"Others are in a situation of despair, but Chung-Myung could not withstand the rising anger and was overturned on the spot.I can't believe he's screwed!There's something else to screw up, wasan! Hwasan\u110b\u1175!\"Oh, my God, he's screwed. Hwasan. Huh...\u2026.\"No matter how hard you try to deny reality, what you see doesn't change. Chung-Myung, who was flustered over and over again, couldn't stand it and ended up screaming.\"Long death penalty, why did you do that? I told you not to do that! You little prick! I've grown up!\"As a matter of fact, I was thinking inside.I mean, maybe Hawasan is really screwed up.No matter how wide I opened my ears on my way here, I didn't hear a word about Hawasan. I could sometimes hear stories about shamans, Shaolin, and even Jongnam in the same island, but there was no word for the story of Hwasan, as if everyone had planned it.If Hawasan is enjoying the same holy spirit as before...\u2026, no, it wouldn't have happened if it had just remained like a literary figure.\"That's why I told you to take it easy. Death penalty.\"Hey, dude. Hawasan is the door. What's the point of being stuck in a mountain, wiping a Donna by yourself, and being fresh? Those who turn a blind eye to others' difficulties are not entitled to discuss the issue.\"\u2026\u2026but you should have done it moderately.\"Elders, great disciples, and even great disciples were wiped out in Daesan Mountain. Although numerous literary groups are said to have generously invested their best, none of them have devoted themselves to every household as much as Hawasan.In the midst of the death of all the long writers and elders who were supposed to lead the civilization, and most of the disciples of the great disciples and the great disciples who were supposed to follow suit were wiped out. All that remains are the three great disciples, who are only under the terms and conditions, and the younger ones who have not mastered the martial arts properly.In such circumstances, how can we carry on the name of the Great Hawasan?\"\u2026\u2026but it is.\"Even the faint hope seemed to collapse. One can tell just by looking at the gate that is worn out and collapsing.That Hawasan is screwed up.\"Death penalty, death penalty, so what did I say? I told you there's nothing left if you give it to others and follow the logic of the gate! Did you want to see this? Hwasan failed in the death penalty! On the death row! I mean, how are you looking at the faces of the investigators in the underworld? You're so frustrated man!\"Chung-Myung lay down on the spot and wrote evil. His resentment came back with echoes.\"I'm going crazy, seriously.\"It's been a hundred years since I came back to life. The four gates are ruined.I fought to protect this gate and protect the strong lake...\u2026, if this is the result, what have we been fighting for?I felt like I was warming up.It was then.\"Who's there?\"A strange voice penetrated Chung-Myung's ear.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a man living in Hawasan who thought he was doomed.Squeak!The decayed heavy wooden door opens hard with an irritating sound of friction. Then, a black conduit, refined through the half-open door, peeked out his head.\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"No, what's wrong with you?\"It's a master.Chung-Myung was convinced that this man was a true Taoist, in a word of man. Because in the past month he's hardly been told he's a child.- No, what's wrong with you?You look like a little beggar.- Is a beggar traveling alone?He's a f*cking beggar.'The beggar was old and young. Young or old beggars are just good beggars. This person deserved to be recognized as a do-in just by calling him a \"child,\" not a \"beggar,\" even when he saw his appearance flowing with dirty soup.A middle-aged monk, who looked about 40 years old, turned his head around and looked around. Then I looked at Chung-Myung with an absurd face.\"Are you here alone? How the hell did you get up here alone?\"\"Uh... it's...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung stuttered.\"I just came up.'I wanted to say that there is nothing impossible with grit, but it was not the right word for the current situation.With his skinny body, no matter what he says, he's suspicious. But there is no need to make excuses. What is important in this case is not to make excuses, but to take the initiative in dialogue.\"More than that, I'd like to ask you a question.\"\"Huh?\"The master opened his eyes wide.It's worth it.It would be absurd to find a child alone in a place where even adults can't easily come up, but wouldn't it be absurd if he said he would ask a question out of the blue?\"Is the seal a man of Hawasan?\"\"\u2026\u2026How do you know the name wasanpa?\"\"Is that right?\"\"For now, yes.\"Chung-Myung breathed a sigh of relief.'You didn't screw up at all!'Of course, it's on the verge of ruin. Just looking at the prose, I can see the angle roughly. But it's important that it's not ruined yet.Anyway, it means that it's in good shape.'Chung-Myung has made up his mind.First of all, somehow, Hawasan...\u2026.\"Come on in.\"\"What?\"Chung-Myung raised his head. Doin said with a gracious smile.\"Isn't the sun setting?\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"Come to think of it, it was already getting dark around.\"Hwasan's night is cold. The weather hasn't warmed up yet, and if you try to spend the night half-heartedly, you'll freeze to death. It would be too much to go down the mountain from now on, but I can't ask you to stay here all night, so let's go in. We don't accept foreigners here now, but we can't hit the night dew on the guests who came after knowing the name of Hawasan.\"Chung-Myung rolled his eyes.Why are you putting it in so easily?There is no reason for them to be wary of Chung-Myung. Pijuktton't won't like about to collapse after eating a little wary of need?\"If you don't have anyone with you and you don't have any plans, let's go in. It's a story, and then we can listen.\"Chung-Myung is a little dazed.I feel like I'm getting emotional.Few traces of the Hawasan faction that commanded the world remained, but the fire to the gate that supported the Hawasan before the inspection still felt like it had not been extinguished.'Yes, that's enough.'What's so important about making a name for the world with a sword? Hawasan was the gate before the inspection. If you're following the door, Hawasan is still alive.\"Then I'll give you trouble.\"Chung-Myung lowered his head lightly, and the man smiled and opened the door.\"Come here.\"\"Yes, before that, I...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung shut up.How should I explain this?'I don't know, I don't doubt it.'\"My name is Chung-Myung. If you don't mind, may I ask for the name of the seal?\"\"It's Chung-Myung. That's a nice name. Bondo is called Unam.\"\"Lunja-bae.\"Chung-Myung's eyes sparkled.The distribution has already gone around once. If it's a luck boat, is that my great-great-great-grandchild?'Hwasan follows the Baeja of Chung-Myung County Unbaek. After one round from the celadon boat to the white porcelain boat, the boat returns to the celadon boat.That monk, Unam, has already passed four generations from Chung-Myung, the capital of Hwasan.'Then you've never even seen me.'The last disciples of Hawasan he saw were wise men. At that time, the wise men were the three great disciples, so the monk named Unam has never seen him before.I realized that many years had passed.Chung-Myung will lead Hwasan with the death penalty...\u2026. No, a child who couldn't even make it to Hwasan in the days when the death penalty was a drag on him is now welcoming him.This strange feeling would not be felt without him.Chung-Myung, guided by Unam, went through the prose and entered.\"Whoa.\"Sigh deeply. I feel a little burdened to see the current wasan with my own eyes.Chung-Myung is determined and determined.Let's stay calm.Considering what they left in Hwasan and what was going on, it was not strange that he was in a shambles. No, it was rather normal.But it is not their fault.It was their fault that they were all wiped out, leaving only children who could not hold the sword properly.In other words, Chung-Myung does not deserve to be angry with these children. On the contrary, you should be sorry.If Chung-Myung were in the same situation as them, would he have struggled to protect Hwasan? He dug his name out of the bandit and went to the shaman. Isn't that common sense?'Well, in what capacity do I blame these children?'You're angry that you can't lead your children to the right path as an adult, and that your child hasn't achieved success? It was a shameless act.No matter what happens, you should be aware that the buck stops with you and accept the situation with a broad heart.\"Whoa.\"Taking a deep breath, Chung-Myung walked inside.It was not long before a wide range of smoke and mirrors were laid out.AhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhIt was a new feeling. Didn't Chung-Myung grow his dream by wielding a sword in this vast field of smoke?Crushed the floor with that white granite...\u2026.\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"Chung-Myung rubbed his eyes.Audience stone? That white lecture hall...\u2026. Where's the auditorium?Chung-Myung's eyes trembled.Why the dirt floor?'In the past, the floor of this haze was filled with solid granite.Although he was dissatisfied with the fact that the floor of the door to be frugal was made of expensive auditorium, he did not insist on removing it because it was unfortunate for children to drink dirt and train.But why did the auditorium disappear so quickly?Was the long story of the time more simple than the long death sentence? Is that why you removed all the auditoriums?\"Hoooooooops.Chung-Myung's forehead was bloodshot.Let's stay calm.Calm down. Let's calm down again. What's so important about a lecture hall?'Then it's a rock.'No matter how expensive the auditorium was! Even if it was so expensive that Jang Mun-sa-hyung was angry that he trained with stones that were more expensive than the people's monthly grain price...\u2026.A man and a woman, a man and a woman...\u2026. Oh, it could have been a surprise.Anyway!If you're in a hurry, you can sell it.'It is important that Hawasan survive. It's not important to protect those stones. It doesn't really matter...\u2026.Let's stay calm.\"Hoop. Hoop.\"Chung-Myung took a deep breath as slowly as possible. Thanks to those who have saved the name of Hawasan even by selling those stones.\u2026.At that moment, Chung-Myung's eyes popped out.Another strange scene caught my eye.Where's Geumcheon Palace?'I can't see the Geumcheon Palace.\"Oh, I can't see you. What the hell are you talking about?'Geumcheongung Palace is not a living creature but a building. Can't your feet run away somewhere?However, no matter how many times you look at it, there was a desolate vacant lot at the site of Geumcheon Palace.\"\u2026\u2026I.\"\"Hmm?\"\"Well, there.\"Chung-Myung's trembling fingertips pointed to the vacant lot where the Geumcheon Palace was originally supposed to be.\"Bae, I think the arrangement is a little strange\u2026Was there anything there originally?\"\"Well, I guess you see that in your eyes, too. Originally, there were warlords in that vacant lot.That's more.\"I guess so.But where did they all go?\"Huh. It's not a story for you, young man.\"Talk to me, man! Why don't I know? I know better than you do!\"Let's just say it's a scar of glory. It's a bit embarrassing to say that the master is honored.\"\"\u2026\u2026the glory freezes to death.\"\"Huh?\"\"It's nothing.Chung-Myung glossed over his words.Hawasan's appearance, in which the audience stone flew away and the hall disappeared, was desolate. Just by blowing a breeze, the soil of the smoke field flies up to create a yellow sand breeze.Is this wasan? This one?I'll believe you, you bastards.\"Turn it off.\"\"Where did it hurt?\"\"Oh, no. Nothing. Nothing.\"Chung-Myung took a deep breath. Every time I inhaled, the sand breeze came into my mouth and it was very shitty and good.\"A little.\"\"Hmm?\"\"I think it's desolate\u2026\u2026.\"\"Yeah.\"Unam smiled sadly. His bitter-looking appearance cuts painfully into Chung-Myung's eyes.'Yes, I suppose so.'I got emotional.Come to think of it, it was those who protected Hwasan like Unam who suffered the most from the fall of Hwasan. If you had the power, how could you have let the gates decline, and if you had no affection, how could you have kept them?'You must have had the hardest time.'Thinking about it makes me feel a little lighter.No matter how great Chung-Myung's shock is, it is nothing compared to the sadness that those who have protected Hawasan have suffered so far. So there's no need to freak out.\"Come here.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes.\"\"If a guest comes, there may be a place to rest, but Hawasan is a gate, so there is a duty for the guest to keep. I understand you want to rest, but first, go to Okcheonwon and learn about the research.\"Chung-Myung nodded.Okcheonwon is a case of abuse, a breakthrough investigation by Hawasan.This is where the inquest is enshrined.It is no exaggeration to say that there is no place more important than Okcheonwon, although many Cabinet posts in Hwasan have their own importance.If Chung-Myung did not lose consciousness of being a disciple of Hwasan, it would have been reasonable to enter Okcheonwon as soon as he entered Hwasan and learn about the investigation. I'm grateful that Unam came forward first in a situation where it's difficult to speak directly...I'm doing.Be anxious.Perhaps because there were so many things I had already seen, I was not happy at all to spend Okcheonwon. What's the difference between a whole Hawaiian mess and a pre-investigation?Let's not be surprised.'I took a deep breath in advance. He vowed never to be surprised if any situation was visible.\"You can go in here.\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung, who controlled his mind over and over again, entered Okcheonwon.Then he stopped at the spot.Okcheonwon was simple. All I could see were the portrait of the abuse investigation, the incense burner in front of it, and the rituals.It was a very frugal look.To be thrifty...Yes, it's very frugal.A groan came out of Chung-Myung's mouth. Soon his body began to tremble.\"Uh, where\u2026\u2026.\"There was also no golden candlestick that the emperor of gold had given to the Abuse Inspector, and the scrolls made with the letters he wrote before his appearance also disappeared.All the paintings that were decorated with gold and filled the hall disappeared.But that wasn't what really surprised Chung-Myung.\"Hey... here.No way.No, I'm sure they put it somewhere.Chung-Myung pointed his trembling hand in front of the statue.\"Huh?\"\"Hey, wasn't there a flower here?\"\"Flower?\"\"...yes, flowers!\"\"How do you know that?\"\"I, did you have one? What did you do with the flower?\"Unam tilted his head. There were many questions I wanted to ask my child, but seeing Chung-Myung's face repeatedly distorted, unfolded, and distorted, I thought I should answer first.\"There was, there was. Plum blossoms made of strange white metal.\"\"Yes! The flower! Where did it go?\"\"Sold.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes?\"\"It was a car that I was worried about because it was useless and didn't fit in with the conduit, but there was a merchant who sold it for a good price.\"\"P, sell\u2026\u2026.\"\"Yes, but you...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung finally flipped his eyes and flipped back.\"Hey, hey! Wake up, man! Wake up!\"\"Gasp...\"Rock-scented white plum blossoms.Hwasan's replacement with his own sword.Not as loud as gold, not as shiny as silver, just plain. But a new one that is said to contain Hawasan's essence.That's what these nut jobs sold out.\"Pah, there's something else to sell.\"This...\"You're selling it, you crazy...\u2026.\"The fatigue up to Hawasan overlapped with shock. Chung-Myung eventually let go of the cord of consciousness.It seemed that Jang Moon-sa-hyung was frightened in front of his eyes, which gradually became white.Death penaltyHwasan is doomed.That's a total disaster, too.Oh, my God!Chung-Myung was completely out of his mind.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If a child climbed here alone, the fatigue would be beyond words.\"So where is the child now?\"\"I've moved it to the Lunar New Year. Just in case, I called Unjin to see the vein, but there is no big problem other than a loss of energy.\"\"That's a relief.\"Hyun Jong nodded still.Whatever the circumstances, anyone in Hawaii is a visitor to Hawaii. It wasn't his wish for such a man to get sick in Hawasan.\"It's strange that a child can climb up to Hawasan alone. Did he say there's no story?\"\"I was going to ask you slowly after ordering you to visit Okcheonwon, but I lost my mind and couldn't ask you about the situation.\"\"I see.\"\"But...\"\"Hmm?\"Unam frowned a little and explained the situation a while ago.Hyun Jong, who heard the whole story, tilted his head.\"You're selling this?\"\"Yes.\"\"Did he say that he left a message like that?\"\"I did. I thought I'd let it slide, but it was weird.\"\"Hmmm.\"Hyun Jong Jin-in swept his beard still.\"Of course I may have misheard. But a long storyteller. He is not the only one who is strange. Before I even spoke, the child first asked me if I was a man of Hawasan. Doesn't that mean you've come to know that this is Hawasan?\"\"Right.\"\"Don't tell me you're up to something...\u2026.\"Hyun Jong burst into laughter.\"Are you worried?\"\"It's not like that...\u2026.\"\"What's so strange about knowing that this place is Hawasan? It was once known to the world. There's nothing strange about having someone who remembers.\"\"Yes.\"\"And you may be descended from the one who went down.\"\"Oh....\"Unam nodded.As the tide turned, many people left Hasan. The few who remained to share their fate with Hwasan until the end were in the minority. It would be natural for such descendants to know that Hawasan is here.\"You have to worry only when you have something to steal. What do you think is left in Hawasan?\"\"\u2026\u2026long man.\"Unam's face was filled with small sorrow. However, Hyun Jong did not see the expression of Unam and was self-helpful.\"Sold and eaten.\"Hyun Jong smiled.\"Yes, I did. Maybe he's a descendant of someone who's really down. It means I know what Okcheonwon was like in the past. I'm embarrassed by the kid.\"\"\u2026\u2026long man.\"\"There you go. It's true that you've sold it, so there's no shame.\"Unam swallowed a dry saliva.I'd rather not talk back.'What he said wasn't just 'sold out.\"You're selling it, you nut job.I wondered what kind of expression Jang would make if he knew that it was, but I couldn't bring myself to say this.\"All right, bring him to me as soon as he wakes up.\"\"Yes, a man of long letters.\"Hyun Jong is deep in thought.'Sold and eaten.'I feel like salt is sprinkled on the wound.'The investigators won't forgive me.'No matter how hard it is to save Hwasan, how could he face the faces of the investigators since he sold the Okcheonwon ritual, which is the history of Hwasan itself?It was something I didn't want to think about it.\u2026.Hyunjong's face got darker.'Hwasan's name shouldn't end in my squadron.'I don't dream of calling the world again. As long as we don't see Hawasan go under his belt.But even that small wish was getting tougher day by day.Unam, who was secretly reading Hyun Jong's countenance, stood up from his seat and made a fuss.\"I'm going to go.\"\"Well.\"Unam, who was about to go outside after asking for permission, suddenly turned his head again and asked Hyun Jong.\"Well... a man of long letters.\"\"Hmm?\"\"What would you do if he wanted to be introduced?\"\"The entrance...\"Hwasan is not accepting introverts at the momentarily. However, it could have been a little different for someone who had a past relationship.\"We don't accept introductions.\"\"All right.\"Hyun Jong, who was nodding off Unam, slightly tilted his head and opened his mouth.\"Wait a minute.\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"What did he say his name was?\"\"Chung-Myung. It's Chung-Myung.\"\"\u2026\u2026Chung-Myung.\"Hyun Jong's expression became subtle.\"All right, get out of here.\"\"Yes, of course.\"When Unam completely left, Hyun Jong opened his mouth.\"Chung-Myung\u2026\u2026.\"At this time, the name of the child who came to Hawaii is the same as Do-ho of the past inspection.\"It's strange.\"It was certainly a bizarre thing.\"If only he was alive.\"If only Chung-Myung, a plum blossom examination known as the Three Great Prosecutors' Office, survived the blood test, Hwasan's fate would have been different from now. It was a meaningless family, but it was Hyun Jong who couldn't let go of his lingering feelings.\"\u2026\u2026supply in quantity.\"Only Hyun Jong's Do-ho, who was left alone, filled the hall in a lonely way.* * *\"Blessing bastards.\"Chung-Myung uttered a curse word.\"You've got nothing to sell, so you're selling the d*mn thing? You're sick of it?A heat billowed up from the inside.Even if you starve to death, there are things you can sell, and there are things you can't sell.No matter how much the rock-scented white plum blossoms look like a shabby ornament, and those who need to explain the true value of white plum blossoms to the young ones died cheap...\u2026 but yes!Sell it even if it's ruined by Hwasan...\u2026.\"No, it's better than screwing up.\"If the investigator saw Chung-Myung now, he would have yelled. What are you obsessed with? No matter how meaningful the object is, the master should not cling to it.I know. I know that!\"Turn it off.\"Chung-Myung groaned and looked down. When I saw the panoramic view, I felt a little relieved.In the past, he used to climb onto Yeonhwabong Peak and look at the panoramic view of Hwasan whenever he had something frustrating. Looking at the sword-like peaks and endless mountain ranges, the brightness rose naturally.But now...\u2026.\"Turn it off.\"You're such a good personally. I'm turning inside out.Every time I saw Hawasan's cabinet down, I felt like my stomach was rotting.\"Mundo has decreased.\"To be exact, it has decreased.It's not like it's just a failure.\"I've sold out everything I can.\"If Okcheonwon is like that, it is obvious without looking elsewhere. Okcheonwon is a place where you can only touch it until the end.After seeing Okcheonwon's disastrous appearance, I could understand why other places were so old and broken down. You wouldn't have had the money to repair it. If you were in a hurry to buy money, would you even pick and sell the jeongseok of the soft armour?\"\u2026\u2026yes, everything else is fine! I understand everything!\"By the way!Why is martial arts such a b*tc*?Chung-Myung started rolling on the floor.Rolling on a cliff may not be something a sane person can do, but Chung-Myung had no time to think about it now.I'm going to die of burning heart before I roll off a cliff.\"You're too old to......not like the three great disciples?\"It is a story about Unam.Originally, Chung-Myung should not be able to guess the level of martial arts in Unam. No matter how hard Chung-Myung built up his past life to be called the Three Prosecutors' Office, now he's like a white child.However, Chung-Myung was able to see the level of martial art in Unam very clearly.Because Chung-Myung was so strong?You're welcome.It's because the force of Unam is too low now. If Chung-Myung went back to his time, Unam probably wouldn't have even received Doho. Not math, but a student who studies the provincial arts.At least you're not as good as a third-generation disciple at an age you seeming to be a second-generation disciple.\"\u2026\u2026What the hell am I supposed to do with this?\"I have no idea where to start and how to touch it. I'd rather start at the bottom. Then if you don't care about this and that and just say whatever you want, it's enough.But isn't this place Hwasan?Why don't you say I'm Chung-Myung?'You'll only get cursed at.I'm glad I didn't get beaten up and kicked out.On the flip side, Chung-Myung won't believe it either.Let's just say I believe. Yes, let's say they are infinitely rational and understand Chung-Myung's story and knowledge of martial arts, and understand him as the Chung-Myung of the past.That is not a good thing either.'I don't have the power to protect my knowledge now.'Chung-Myung was like a rolling treasure. The knowledge you have is beyond reviving a clan, but you have no power to protect yourself.Chung-Myung knows.His death penalty was no more a doer, but not all the people of Hawasan were good and clean. Chung-Myung alone is about a circle away from Sunham.What if one of them takes a bad heart and beats Chung-Myung?You'll end a lot of your second life by robbing yourself of what you have and being buried somewhere.'You can't do that.'That's....\"Then I have to revive this wasan without revealing that I'm Chung-Myung.\"At least he should hide it until he's regained the right to defend himself.\"\u2026\u2026it's easier to fight with Magyo again.\"It was a difficulty that made me laugh automatically.I'll have to teach him martial arts so he won't be able to save wasan, but he shouldn't be caught knowing martial arts. Where is this kind of nonsense?I want to give up everything in temper, but...\u2026.Chung-Myung turned his head with a heavy sigh and looked down. Half-clouded by clouds, Hawasan catches his eye.\"\u2026\u2026If I knew this would happen, I shouldn't have caused trouble.\"He is in debt to Hawasan.The reason why he was able to brag about being a top three prosecutors is all because of what was given to him by Hwasan.But he didn't return anything to Wasan. It only gives one honor for knocking down Heavenly Demon. Thanks to that, Hawasan was destroyed and on the verge of ruin.So how can we turn a blind eye to Hasan?It couldn't be done on human grounds.\"Oh, the death penalty...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung raised his head. Long death penalty seems to be smiling at him in the blue sky.- But it's still Hawaiian.\"\u2026\u2026Yeah.\"Chung-Myung shook his head and raised himself.In order not to be killed by the death penalty when you go to the underworld, you must somehow make this collapsing Hwasan a human being.\"What the hell is wrong with you?\"When you first learned martial arts in Hawasan, who thought he would be the best master of Hawasan? Everyone thought it was a good thing you didn't get in trouble!It's Chung-Myung, who overcame those harsh glances and became the best Hawaiian ever! Challenging the impossible was Chung-Myung's specialty. Now that it's like this...\u2026.\"Let me make the world's most civilized group!\"Chung-Myung's eyes were on fire.And at that moment everyone in Hawasan had to tremble in an unknown chill.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can't believe I've overcome the vanity that I couldn't overcome when I was a master. Oh, my god.\"Then follow me for a moment.\"\"Yes?\"\"The long man wants to see you.\"\"Oh, yes.\"Chung-Myung nodded.If you have to go through it anyway, it's better to go through it as soon as possible.As soon as the door was opened, an old man quietly settled into Chung-Myung's sight. Chung-Myung looked at him with a slight dithering feeling.Although he certainly deserves to be called a long-time writer.'The pure pottery that you can be felt.The pottery alone is convincing that this person has spent his entire life in Doga.But...I don't feel up to it at all.'The length of any conduit was not insufficient, but it could not be thought of as a long piece of Mufah called Hawasan. It's just pure.\"Say hello.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung sighed secretly.'How could you be so unfair?'Perhaps in terms of age, Chung-Myung was a toddler when he was drinking alcohol avoiding the long death penalty's eyes in the corner of Wasan. You didn't think he'd catch a sword until he died.I can't believe Chung-Myung has to say hi now.'You shouldn't have been born again if you felt wronged.'What can I do? I'd rather die than suffer.Chung-Myung bowed politely. As he looked at the scene, the long-length Hawaiian Hyun Jong smiled softly.\"My name is Chung-Myung.\"\"Bondo is called Hyun Jong.\"It was a simple courtesy.When Chung-Myung sat down, Hyun Jong opened his mouth.\"We have guests, but we have nothing to offer. I hope you understand the current situation here.\"\"Oh, yes.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hyun Jong's eyebrows slightly wiggled.Usually, when I say this, the answer is...'Don't worry.'Like\"How could an uninvited guest wish for such a thing?'It has to be about.By the way, this guy...Never mind, I didn't expect that.I was saying this with my eyes and gestures.\"I heard you said something interesting at Okcheonwon.\"\"Yes?\"\"Did you sell it?\"Chung-Myung tilted his head.\"What do you mean?\"He has no idea what he's talking about. Hyun-jong narrowed his eyes and looked at Chung-Myung's complexion, but there was no lie on that face.You really don't know?'A child can't be that good at lying.Chung-Myung was smiling inwardly while Hyun Jong was contemplating.It's no use looking at it. You son of a b*tc*.\"Who is Chung-Myung?It was a seed that naturally cheated against Cheon Mun, who was said to have climbed Cheonan Tong. Jang Moon-hyung suspected Chung-Myung every time, but he could not find the alcohol and hiding place he had hidden in the company until the end.Looking at Chung-Myung, who is nonchalant even if he is questioned, let's get hit because he has no physical evidence.\u2026. No, not this. Anyway!Even Chun Mun could not see through Chung-Myung's lies, but Hyun Jong could not notice Chung-Myung's lies by his facial expressions and gestures.\"Didn't you say you said that?\"\"I don't remember. Except that I was so tired that I lost consciousness.\u2026.\"\"Hmm.\"Logic is perfect. His body must have reached its limit by leading a young body up this rugged Hawasan. So it's not strange to fall unconscious.But...\"If you were so tired, why didn't you tell me?\"\"If you're in the door, it's important to give examples to the king...\u2026.\"Hyun Jong looked back at Unam with strange eyes.There was a slight cloud cancer.Hyunjong's eyes...\"He came all the way up here alone, did you have to drag a tired child there to bow to him? Hey, you're right.I was saying that.Of course, it was crazy and crazy for Unam.\"No, I was fine!'Apparently, he was like a fresh fish until he entered the prose. But you're so tired that you fell down! What the hell is going on here?Unam looked at Chung-Myung with absurd eyes, but Chung-Myung looked innocent as if he knew nothing.\"Hmmm.\"Hyun Jong nodded.\"It's possible. I'm sorry I couldn't care less.\"\"No.\"\"Yes, that raises another question.\"\"Yes?\"\"Why did you come all the way up this rugged mountain?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Don't tell me you've just been here. Hawasan is not a mountain that can be climbed by experience. What's more, climbing this mountain with that young body wouldn't have been normal.\"Chung-Myung looked up and looked at Hyun Jong. It was a sharp question. However, the answer to this question is already in place.\"The Long Man.\"\"I'm listening.\"\"I want to enter Hawaii.\"Hyun Jong's eyes have become slimmer.\"Introduction?\"\"Yes.\"Hyun Jong still made eye contact with Chung-Myung. I couldn't read any other intentions from those bright and innocent eyes.\"Do you mean you admit that you deliberately climbed Hawasan?\"\"That's right.\"\"Hmmm.\"Hyun Jong nodded.Chung-Myung came by accident to the end. If Hyun Jong had insisted, he would not have believed Chung-Myung. Hawasan is not just a place to stop by.\"I'm a freshman in Hawasan. Does that mean you know what was like in Wasan?\"\"Yes.\"Hyun Jong's eyes narrowed again.\"It's an entrance.\"Chung-Myung slightly moistened his lips.'The logic is perfect.'You can use the Chong Jin guy.His priest, Chong Jin, went missing while being chased by a Magian mob before they prepared for the final battle. Words are missing, not missing, but dying during the war.'Chong Jin fell off a cliff, and a woodcutter found him and treated him...\u2026, but the injury was so deep that he could not shake off his seat, but thanks to the woodcutter, he taught Hawasan's martial arts and made him a disciple.'And Chung-Myung is descended from the woodcutter!'Kkk.'It's an amazing script.The best thing about this scenario is that Chung-Myung can control his distribution.If the woodcutter who saved Chung Jin is the father, Chung-Myung becomes a master. It is embarrassing to say that a young man who was a young man 100 years ago is a father, so even if he writes a screenplay as a grandfather, he is twice as wise.In other words, it is distributed on a par with long writers.If this happens, no matter how hard you push out the distribution, you will receive a higher allocation than entering the company as a new employee.\"But I can't afford to be assigned the same as the blue ones.'It is impossible to find the original allocation, but at least it deserves preferential treatment. It's frustrating that I have to bow my head to these blue guys and treat them like they're alive.Now, ask me why.'Then I'll release the script I wrote. In the meantime, if you could solve some of his German literature...\u2026.\"I'll let you.\"\"Yes, of course I'm allowed...\u2026. What?\"Chung-Myung looked at Hyun Jong with his eyes wide open.Contrary to his expectations, Hyun Jong was nodding his head with a calm face.\"If you want an introduction, you have to.\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"No. Wait a minute.Why is it so easy to get in? You're not an official in this neighborhood kids go to.If a guy who's never seen his face comes and says he's going to start, it's normal to suspect him!\"Come on, Long Writers!\"Unam said in surprise that she felt the same way.\"You said you wouldn't accept an introduction, did you?\"That's right! You can't take it that easy!\"I've changed my mind.\"Hyun Jong replied with a light smile.\"Come to think of it, we're not in a position to cover our mouths. Besides, I can't just throw out a kid who came after knowing Hwasan.\"\"Ha, but...\u2026.\"\"Unam.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Fate goes round and round. Whatever the meaning of this child is, he came to know the name of Hwasan and came to join it. Birds in the eaves don't chase them to avoid the rain, and they give food to animals who come to the caves in winter. Why would we kick out anyone who came into our arms because we had so much to care about?\"It was a remark that felt good. I might have been moved if someone else had heard it. But Chung-Myung was a human being about 30,000 miles away from the vessel or pottery. As soon as I heard that, I had goosebumps all over my body.What kind of relationship is that? If someone you don't know comes to you, start doubting him!\"How did a man like this become a long-lived man? No, I'm sure he's a man of letters. That's what it's like to be a long writer.\"Oh, no, I...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung has set out to patch things up.\"Before that, I've lived...\u2026.\"\"It's all right.\"Hyun Jong shook his head.\"It doesn't matter what kind of life you had before you went into labor. Whether you've lived a sinner's life or an adult's life, it's a secular thing. As soon as you climb up to the Hawasan and return to the Hawasan, you are gone.\"Of course you are. But it shouldn't be like this...\u2026.\"Oh, no....\"\"You're fine, but you're fine.\"Dude, I'm not okay! Listen to me! Talk to me!Hyun Jong smiled brightly.\"Unam.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Give this child a place and prepare for the entrance ceremony.\"\"Yes, I'll be ready.\"\"Did you say your name was Chung-Myung?\"Chung-Myung nodded unconsciously.\"That's a nice name. That's a very good name. The name of the child who will be a celadon belly is Chung-Myung. Hahaha. This is meant to be. We don't have to decide on a separate name. You don't know, but your name is very meaningful in Hawasan.\"Hyun Jong's eyes became dim.\"Be the man worthy of his name.\"As the situation flowed this far, Chung-Myung couldn't have anything more to say.\"\u2026\u2026Yes.\"\"Get out.\"Chung-Myung rose from his seat with a distraught face. Unam also took him out with a dazed face.\"This way.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung trudged out and caught sight of the wide-ranging Hawasan.'You've made your entrance.'The introduction is.At that moment, Unam spoke solemnly in a lower voice than before.\"We haven't had an entrance ceremony yet, but from this moment on you are a disciple of Hawasan. You will be the youngest of Hawasan's three great disciples.\"\"\u2026\u2026the youngest.\"Chung-Myung's face trembled.The youngest?Did I?This plum screen Chung-Myung is the youngest in Wasan?\"Hahahaha.\"Unam smiled happily at Chung-Myung, who was laughing.\"You must be happy.\"\"Yes, I love it.

I think we just need to proceed with the entrance ceremony right away.\"\"I see.\"Unam's eyes turned to the feet. Hyun Jong smiled and opened his mouth.\"You don't seem to like it.\"\"It's not that I don't like it\u2026\u2026.\"Unam, who had hesitated a little, sighed and opened his mouth.\"I don't know all the deep intentions of a man of letters. It's hard to understand why you have to accept that child. Now is the time for Hawasan to cut back on one person's mouth.\"\"Yes, I will.\"\"I don't bring wealth like other children, and I don't see any particular talent for martial arts.\"\"Hmm.\"\"More than anything else, I don't feel any sense of goodness. He doesn't seem to fit the door. So why would you place that child on the enemy of Hawasan?\"Hyun Jong smiled softly at Unam's comments.\"Did he?\"\"\u2026\u2026long man.\"Unam sighed deeply. Sometimes Hyun Jong is so rude.'I don't know.'Although he has been supporting Hyun Jong for well over a decade, he was still Unam, who could not guess what he was thinking. Hyun Jong is too deep a man to look up to him.\"Unam.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Sometimes fate comes unexpectedly.\"Hyun Jong smiled brightly.\"Maybe the child could be the light of Hawasan.\"\"\u2026\u2026the child is too young to be the light of Hawasan.\"\"Maybe.\"Hyunjong's face got darker.The current state of affairs in Hawasan is simply a windbreaker. He is struggling, but there is nothing strange about it if he fails right away.There was also this reason why Unam felt uncomfortable about introducing Chung-Myung.How great will the loss be if we leave our enemies in Munpa, which may be ruined tomorrow, and then they are driven to the streets?\"I know the situation is difficult.\"Hyun Jong opened his mouth heavily.\"But Unam. Plum blossoms bloom in the snow. Plum blossoms blooming in the cold have a more mellow scent than any other plum blossoms.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"If we don't plant seeds because winter has come, the possibility of plum blossoms blooming in the snow will disappear.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes.\"\"Yes, go out.\"Unam quietly closed the door and came out. Then he sighed and raised his head.Whenever he came out of the conversation with Hyun Jong, he felt as if his heart was opening.However, even though I had a conversation with Hyun Jong today, I felt frustrated rather than relieved. Hyun Jong's words still left young Hyun-gi, but the reason why his mind is still dizzy is probably because of the situation he is in now.Now, Hawasan couldn't be saved by himself.Hyun Jong tried throughout his life, but things only got worse. If this continues, it won't be over this year.When I thought that Hawasan, who boasts history and tradition, could completely perish, my heart ached and sighed.Where is Hawasan going?'Unam closed her eyes still.* * *Chung-Myung looked down blankly at his clothes.A white coat catches his eye. It is strange to see five plum blossoms engraved on the right chest. I feel like my whole body is ticklish...\u2026.\"No, it's really itchy.\"The material of the clothes is so bad that it feels like it's poking every time it touches the skin. It would have been very inconvenient if I hadn't worn rags before coming here. A month of beggars helped in this respect.\"Tsk.\"Chung-Myung frowned.\"I'm going to have it's\"In the past, Hawasan was not a money-laden doorkeeper like a shaman or Shaolin, but he still raked in huge wealth as an old file room.Of course, I couldn't spend the money to my heart's content, but at least it was enough to dress my students and feed them good clothes.But with clothes...\u2026.\"And what have they done with all that money?\"There must have been a mountain of money in the safe!No, it's the money in the safe. How many bases and sales outlets does Hwasan have in the synagogue, and where did they sell all the money to make children wear such a big sock?Even if it could be a mess because you didn't deliver it properly, wouldn't it be hard to understand that you wasted the money you had?Chung-Myung sighed deeply.\"Nothing is going right.\"Arthur, the more I keep thinking, the more headache I get.If you look forward to it, you'll only get disappointed.\"Anyway, we're in.\"I did the introduction. The introduction.The worst mishap of the world's plum blossoms being introduced to Hawasan's youngest, but where did you enter anyway?It wasn't the way Chung-Myung wanted it to be, but somehow it was successful to enter Hawasan.There are a lot of problems to be solved from now on, but wouldn't it be a step forward?No matter how hard and difficult it is, there is nothing you can't do if you solve it step by step by step. Most things in the world are done by rolling a man to death...\u2026.\"But where the hell are we?\"There is a fundamental problem.The hall where Chung-Myung is now located was used as a guest house in the past. However, what has changed in the meantime, and the past has disappeared from nowhere and turned into a lodging.As Chung-Myung remembers, there is no such concept of accommodation in Hwasan. The new entrants immediately became priests and began living in their teachers' homes.So what the hell is this place?\"It's strange to see it as a place where you stay for a while before you have a priesthood.\"For such a place, basic facilities were properly equipped. No matter how you look at it, it's a place made for people to live.Am I the only one here?'Chung-Myung slipped out of the room.Rooms lined up left and right around the narrow corridor. It is no different from the past audience.Chung-Myung opened the door of the next room. You can see clothes and various living tools in the room.Who's living here?'Chung-Myung tilted his head.Why do you have to live in a guest house like this...\u2026.\"Who is it?\"Chung-Myung turned his head.'Oh my!'You don't realize there's someone coming! Such a mistake.'Oh, I'm not good at martial arts, am I?'On my way to Hawasan, I learned only that meatball to die. Thanks to you, your body is getting stronger, and the foundation on the floor is becoming a vast land, but...\u2026.Realistically speaking, all that could be used right now was as much experience as nails.The airworthiness that spans the subtle lines of existence and non-existence cannot maintain the same sense as Chung-Myung in the past.\"Who's this guy? He's peeking at someone else's room. Are you a thief?\"My mouth is a bit rough.It was a child about Chung-Myung's age. When the child screams, some children rush up the stairs.\"What?\"\"Jo-Gol, what's wrong?\"A child called Jo-Gol points at Chung-Myung and points a finger at him.\"He was peeking at my room.\"\"Who's this guy?\"\"I think he's the new guy.\"Chung-Myung's eyes turned to the ceiling of the hallway.Why did you come back to life?What a rough ride this is that?It's also upsetting to see blue young people pointing their fingers, apparently these were celadon ships. By allocation, Chung-Myung is their heightened fatherhood.Of course it's possible because you don't know.But how do we understand that the people who have enemies on the door are making fun of the neighborhood like they're threatening themselves? It was a time when I was wondering where to start and how to break their habit.\"What a fuss!\"\"Gasp!\"\"Lunar prosecutor's dorm!\"Children retreat from side to side in the voice heard from below. A man came up the stairs and frowned.Stubbornness is buried in the face and gesture. I felt a sternness that would not cause a drop of blood even if I poke it with a needle.A man called Ungum looked through everyone with sharp eyes to match Doho, the sword.\"Why do you come back to the coffin and make a scene when you have to train? Who said I could be lazy?\"\"I mean...\u2026 I'm here to get a new uniform because it's dirty.\"\"Where's the excuse?\"\"I'm sorry.\"The children panicked and sat on the fence. Meanwhile, I couldn't give up glancing at Chung-Myung.\"You?\"\"My name is Chung-Myung.\"\"You're the new kid at the White House from today.\"\"The White House?\"\"This is the White House. The camp where the three great disciples of Hawasan live. Didn't you hear that?\"\"\u2026\u2026the dorm?\"The man frowned.\"Didn't you know it's polite to answer questions before you ask them back?\"\"Oh, yes. I'm sorry.\"John. John.\u2026thank you.I felt empty again. Now we have to take the kids who didn't even enter Hwasan at the time of his reign to the presidency.'Oh, this is non-possession.'You said you had to give up your position and face to become a true master. I never thought I'd be forced to go through a phase that I'd never endured before.He's going to be on the boat.\"Follow me.\"\"Yes?\"\"You have to train, whether late or early. A day earlier wouldn't make a difference. It is not the job of the attendant to waste time carelessly.\"Chung-Myung agreed with that.Chung-Myung needs to be strong as soon as possible to change this terrible situation. To do so, the environment and time to concentrate on training were absolutely necessary.The problem is that what they are trying to teach him is basic martial arts that are of no use to Chung-Myung.I'm gonna have to teach you.'\"Come down.\"When the man goes away first, the children follow the man. One of them sneaked around and turned his head toward Chung-Myung.He was called Jo-Gol earlier.\"I'll see you at night.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I'm gonna fix you up.\"\"\u2026\u2026yes, yes.\"\"If you run away, you'll be more beaten.\"\"Hi, hi.\"\"This is real!\"\"What are you doing?\"The child screamed in horror at the sharp voice of the sword.\"Gee, I'm coming. Homokjo!\"Chung-Myung sighed as he looked at the child running forward.\"Be pretty.\"But they're the descendants of a cute private affair.Of course, Chung-Myung's way of loving children may be a little different from others. But.\"That's their business.\"The grin went down Chung-Myung.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then Chung-Myung asked suddenly.\"When did the White House come into being?\"\"Why did you wonder?\"\"I've heard that Mufa usually teaches by establishing a priestly relationship.\"\"Hmmm.\"\"But it's a little weird to be in a place like that.\"The eyebrows of the sword wiggled slightly.'You're hitting a nerve.'Traditionally, Hawasan also adopted the principle of transmission through priestly relationships. The newly introduced child is associated with a teacher of upper distribution, who strictly follows the laws of Hawasan and teaches disciples.Such a series of priestly relationships came together to create a huge cult called Hwasan.This priest's law has been broken because of the fall of Hawasan.\"There's nothing strange. I just thought it was more efficient.\"\"Then, does he stay at the White Plum?\"\"\u2026\u2026no.\"Chung-Myung nodded slightly. The crybaby frowns at the response.'That's a weird guy.'The answer to the question could not have been obtained from this answer. But Chung-Myung nodded convincingly and was no longer paying attention.I don't know what the hell I'm convinced of.Basically, all those who first entered Hawasan are sent to the White House. In other words, Ungeom, who plays the role of white plumism, is the first to identify Hawasan's new disciples.I've seen a lot of children, but I feel different from the children I've had. How can I put this? I can't explain exactly, but I'm not a child of ease.Funny guy's in.'Chung-Myung had a completely different idea while Ungum slowly searched Chung-Myung.He's gone.I have a rough idea of the situation.If you look at Hawasan as a whole, you can see at a glance that there are ridiculously few people. Considering the number of disciples remaining at the time when he was rushing to Mt. 100,000, the number was enormous.If only that number had been maintained, Hwasan would not have been this empty. In other words...\u2026.'That's a lot of people cheap out of Wasan.'The number would not have decreased at once.But there must be someone escaping from a sinking ship. If you leave Hawasan one by one, you will end up running out of people to teach.It is okay if those who have not received the disciple leave. However, if those who had long had enemies in Hwasan and raised him to his disciples turn their backs on him, the remaining disciples will have nowhere to go. There is a limit to what other teachers take charge of for you.As a result, this system would have come out as a desperate measure. If you teach children in one place as a group, you don't have to worry about decreasing the number of teachers.\"Sad.\"Chung-Myung smacked his lips.What if you don't want to?'It is not to blame that it is different from the past. Chung-Myung was a pragmatist, unlike the tightly clenched long death penalty. It is more important to produce results than to cling to tradition.If you've got a way to build a white plum and maintain the wasan, that's fine. I felt a little bit bitter, but...\u2026.The children who had to build the White Casket would have been more torn apart.'It was Chung-Myung who was a little depressed because he could guess how it felt.No, it's not the time to think like this.'It is enough for others to be depressed. Chung-Myung's job was not to be swayed by emotions, but to make Hawasan the capitalist of the past again.Three-armed men.'In front of my eyes, the three smoke-arms were unfolded. A tall platform was built at the top of the large vacant lot, and the front was filled with small children.'Oh?'Chung-Myung tilted his head.The number of the three great disciples seems to be a little higher than I thought. Compared to the past, it was not too much to describe as a handful, but considering the current situation in Hawasan, the disciple seems to have received quite a lot.\"All sword!\"\"Burn it!\"With the command, the sword is pointed forward in unison.'Oh?'Chung-Myung looked at the scene with wonder. Hawasan is quite a liberal literary group. Some people are accused of having a strong propensity, but the reason is not because they do not follow Doga's teachings. For he believes that forcing his disciples to teach him is also against the rules.Thanks to this, it was rare to see such large-scale training scenes in Hawasan. They have a sense of belonging but respect each other's differences. That was the Hawaiian Chung-Myung knew.It's amazing.It is certainly interesting to see more than a hundred people learn the same swords in such a Hawaiian.Chung-Myung alone has never done this kind of training except for his experience of matching swords with the death penalty to learn Chilseong medical examinations. And it's not like a seven-year-old checkup.\"Baegum!\"Argh!About a hundred swords turn upside down and shine.Chung-Myung burst into admiration at the sight.\"Wow\u2026\u2026\"\"Is it interesting?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"There was a slight smile on the mouth of the sword.\"There's no surprise. If you train hard, you'll soon be like those kids.\"\"\u2026\u2026yes.\"Chung-Myung's answer came out a little strange, but Chung-Myung, who was amazed by the sight in front of him, was rather pleased to think it was because he was caught in the eye.Of course, Chung-Myung's idea was the opposite.\"What's he doing?'As time goes by, Chung-Myung's eyes get narrower.\"I'm a sword!\"The children in the uniform quickly run forward one step at a time and stab the sword forward. It was a childlike, precise, and strong.\"Well....\"\"Huh?\"\"What sword is that?\"\"What do you mean?\"\"Oh... the prosecution.\"The fortune-teller nodded as if he knew it and answered.\"The sword you're using now is called a musculothorax.\"\"Yoo, meat?\"\"Yes, it's exactly what we call a jinx. It is a sword technique that has been handed down to Hawasan that the presenters have changed more practically. The foundation of all Hawaiian martial arts.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"It won't be easy to learn, but if you keep up the good work, you'll see the results. You should go back there and stand together. It may be awkward because it's your first time, but think of it as a way to lighten up the mood today. Detailed transfer will take place within two weeks.\"Chung-Myung walked back with a look of soul.'You look frightened.'Looking at the figure, the Woon Sword slightly frowned.Kids these days don't have the spirit.'It's like...The Woon Sword glanced at the children.It is strange that a young man is not frightened by the sight of the death penalty training with a real sword. Even the fearless children who call for the world's best master will tremble as soon as they see the real sword.You'll get used to it soon, but I thought it would be better not to expect too much from that child.But Chung-Myung in the back seat had a completely different idea.What the hell are you doing? You crazy people.\"Actual performance?When?Erra, you're gonna drown this shit!What was the introductory martial arts?It is the introductory martial arts that teach children what Muhak is to children who know nothing. In terms of the study hall, it is almost like a thousand characters.By the way, what would happen if you were to teach your children quickly and taught them the Analects with the Analects?We'll be ahead of ourselves for a while. Just for a second. I'll be able to recite an analects that other kids don't even know. But can the children understand the deep meaning of the analects?This is a mess for the kids.'No, it's not a bad.'It's that urgent, so we could use this expedient. Too far to the Analects. It's not as profound as the actual magic of the meat that they're playing now.But!\"If you want to do that, at least teach.\"\"Huh?\"\"Hmm?\"Children around Chung-Myung look back at Chung-Myung all at once to see if the idea popped out of their mouths. Chung-Myung shook his head quickly as he looked at the gaze focused on him with blank eyes. The children all looked at Chung-Myung with suspicious eyes.At that time, the student Lee Dae-dae shouts loudly at the podium.\"Where are you looking at during training?\"\"Huh!\"\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\"\"Everyone who looks away, Marvo!\"\"Turn it off.\"\"Phew!\"The children groan and take a mavo. Put the sword on both hands and bend your knees. Chung-Myung clicked his tongue at the sight.Then Lee Dae-dae's eyes are on Chung-Myung this time.\"You?\"\"Yes?\"\"Why don't you play Mabo?\"\"I'm not distracted.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Lee Dae-dae student nodded while blinking his eyes. It's not wrong.\"Go on, BAEKOM!\"Orders kept falling.Chung-Myung looked up at the sky as he saw a student demonstrating on the platform.The sky is so blue.Clear without a cloud...\u2026 it's like seeing the future of Hasan with nothing.How do I change this?'It's not so hard to be alone in the world. He has deep experience and a long future ahead of him. Rather, it is more difficult not to be the best in the world.But it is not Hwasan.No money, no people. Muhak is a shambles. Changing Hawasan as a third-generation disciple is more difficult than becoming a worm dragon.\"Sigh...\"Then there was a sharp voice in his ear.\"Hey.\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"\"You're new, aren't you?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"I can't believe the three great disciples are new to each other. How far is this Moon faction broken?\"But?\"\"I'll see you later. I'm going to kill you.\"Chung-Myung smacked his lips.\"All good, but let me ask you one question.\"\"Is this crazy? You don't know the subject, do you speak informally?\"\"Okay. Answer me first. Then I'll let you do whatever you want.\"\"What?\"\"What else are you learning here?\"\"This?\"\"That meatball or something.\"\"After learning the Jinsukhap, I learn the Chilhyeon sword. After that, he graduated from the White Plum and learned how to appeal.\"\"Appeal?\"\"Yes, and then you can learn the Taeul-Mi-Geum, which is the purification of Hawaiian Muhak.\"\"\u2026The Sunset?\"\"Yes!\"\"In advance of the sun?\"Chung-Myung's eyebrows began to wriggle arbitrarily.That's not true.I don't think so.No way.\"Ha, let me ask you one more question.\"\"What?\"\"When are you going to learn this twenty-four plumage test?\"\"\u2026\u2026what is it?\"\"The Twenty-Four Plum Blossom.\" Hwasan's Purification of Twenty-four Plum Blossoms!\"The child who was answering frowned.\"What are you saying? There is no such prosecution in Hwasan.\"\"\u2026\u2026none?\"\"Yes, I've never heard of it before.\"\"Growl.\"A strange sound is flowing out of my mouth.\"There's no such thing as a two-hundred-four-year-old plumage? And the ones who need to learn it learn the sun and the sun in advance?\"There was blood in Chung-Myung's eyes.- Priest, you have too little moral tendency and too little power. I don't think it's a problem to completely remove it from Hawaiian Muhak. What do you think?- It's a completely useless sword. Let's throw it away.- But it was left by a good man...\u2026.- Then why don't you take them out of the library so they don't care?- Hmm, that would be great. Let's do that.Death penalty.The children learn the sun's blade in advance. Death penaltyErra, Ciba, Hawasan Reconstruction is freezing to death. I'm going to fall down with a vase before I rebuild Hawasan. I will!\"Who's talking again? You guys, get out here right now!\"\"Oh, see you later! Really!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung's forehead had a huge bloodbath.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You'd rather die than suffer!\"Chung-Myung's face returning to the White Tube was rotten to the core.There's nothing in place.The rich said they would go for three years even if they fail, but I think it was too much until a hundred years ago. Judging from the current situation soberly, except for the value of the name Hawasan, it is no better than a third-class civilization.It's not that there's nothing to get better, it's typical of the lower class.'There is no money, the children are in bad shape, and there is a lot of their own dog poop philosophy that no one understands.That's the third-rate thing! There's no third-rate?Everything else is fine. Yeah, everything else is fine!By the way!\"Where'd you sell the Twenty-four Plum Blossoms? You bastards!\"The transfer can be wrong. It's harder than you think to learn martial arts only with a low grade.You get caught in the mouth of a coin while learning martial arts only on a non-grade basis.However, it is quite common for martial arts to degenerate by advancing to a different interpretation from the intention of non-payment.But I can't believe the martial arts are gone. Oh, my God!No matter how old they are! There's still a grade and a history left, but I didn't sell it to anyone else. I mean, does this make sense?\"Huh!\"Chung-Myung scratched his head.\"What the hell is this\u2026\u2026 Where do I start?\"The term \"total crisis\" is used at times like this.\"Do I have to save Hwasan in this situation?\"When I look up and look up at the sky, the death penalty seems to smile.If you tell me to, come on.\"Oh, my God!\"Chung-Myung, who grabbed a handful of dirt from the floor and threw it into the sky, headed for the white plum.\"Oh, my back.\"Maybe it's because I've done too much Mabo, but my back hurts.d*mn, you're letting me finish my training for a little chat. If he were still alive in his previous life, they would have had to travel back and forth from the bottom of the hill to the top of the hill!It's better than too soft.I'm starting to feel a little rushed.'Chung-Myung smacked his lips.For now, I was going to figure out how Hwasan works and think about where to fix it, but the more I get to know him, the more I get to know him, the more I am going forward.It would have been much easier if Chung-Myung had moved on to this era with his body and identity in the past. It's enough if you just hit the head of a writer and turn it upside down.But now Chung-Myung's status is the tombstone of the three great disciples. That's from a beggar. Furthermore, Muhak is only a tenuous level.Is it possible to change wasan from this position?\"HoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooJust thinking about it makes me sigh.Of course, if you take the time to change slowly, you don't know how it's possible. But the problem is that Chung-Myung is not a very laid back personality. If you keep watching it go around here, you'll end up in bed with Hwasan's disease before he changes.I'm a shaman and Cheongseong. I'm sure he's improving even at this momentarily.'Generally, Mufas focus on reproducing the martial arts of Gaepajo called 'Jongsa'.But Chung-Myung's idea was different.The world is bound to evolve eventually. No matter how many researchers say that they were geniuses among geniuses, if many pan-gazers continue to study the achievements of geniuses, they will eventually surpass the level of genius.In other words, as time goes by, Muhak will eventually develop.The reverse perspective, called Sorim's non-mutual science, does not mean that the reverse perspective, which was first invented by Yukjo Hyenung, is passed down. Numerous future generations are developing at this time, making up for the lack of new interpretations.Yes, development...\u2026.\"Others are developing at this hour, forgetting that they are, let alone develop.\"So how can you not turn your stomach?Chung-Myung sighed deeply.First of all...My stomach is growling.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung looked down at his ship.\"Tsk.\"Perhaps because he has lived as a beggar for a long time, his body is always full of food.Come to think of it, you didn't have dinner.'Everyone else finished training and went to eat, but Chung-Myung couldn't eat because he was punished.There is nothing like fasting in bees before and now. It's not as annoying as not being able to push grain into a hungry body after training.Chung-Myung entered the White House holding his stomach. First of all, I need to organize today's work...\u2026.\"Here it comes.\"Chung-Myung, who went inside, slightly raised his eyes at the enthusiastic hospitality towards him. Dozens of disciples were sitting around the huge living room as soon as they entered.\"Hey, new guy!\"Chung-Myung's eyes stare helplessly at them.\"You've met me, haven't you?\"It was a guy called Agal. Seeing the tingling pain on his face, he didn't seem to have been waiting with good intentions.Chung-Myung, who sighed deeply, opened his mouth while looking at Agal.\"Why, Argall?\"Agal's face heated up in an instantaneously.\"Are you crazy? Call it Jo-Gol death penalty!\"\"The death penalty...\"Chung-Myung's head heads to the ceiling. Looking at the old ceiling of the old wooden building, I felt like crying.Oh, now I'm in a position to call these little things the death penalty.But what can I do? You should've come early if you're upset.\"Yes, yes. Jo-Gol death penalty. So what's the matter?\"\"If you're new, you should have a hazing ceremony.\"\"Yes?\"\"Don't worry. I won't do it too hard. Apparently, it's dry and twisted, and I'm afraid I'll die if I hit it hard.\"I burst into laughter everywhere. Everyone seems to have done this many times because they seem to like it.Well, I understand.That's what group life is like. Through our initiation ceremony, we strengthened our bond and learned each other's faces. Most of the guys who are giggling around now would have gone through this initiation.'Although the quality looks a bit bad.'It's not that I'm dissatisfied with the hazing, but their attitude is a little annoying. I can't believe the men with the enemy at the conduit giggle like a city-runner.Of course, Chung-Myung was a bit frivolous when he first entered Hawasan, but he didn't behave like them.That's what an old man says?I'm 80 years old!\"It's a hazing ceremony.\"Chung-Myung nodded. First of all, it's important to meet these guys' needs and melt them down.I'm sick of it, but what can I do? It's all one way to save Hawasan.\"Well, what should I do?\"Jo-Gol smirked.\"Metabolism.\"\"Yes.\"\"Do you want to be metabolized?\"Metabolism?Chung-Myung turned his head and saw a guy called the Metabolite. One hand taller than the others, certainly looks older.So he's the oldest of the three disciples.\"You take care of it.\"\"Yes, of course.\"The pecking order quickly ended in Chung-Myung's head.He's a long shot, but the big shot is Jo-Gol.'This was the case with his distribution in the past. Although Jang Moon-hyung had a cause as a long-term writer, it was Chung-Myung who solved the problem when there. Long positions and influential figures are not the same.Then let's roll this situation well...\u2026.\"Take it off.\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"Chung-Myung's head was turned to the side.Did you hear something wrong?\"Take it off.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung looked around. He can see the children filling the white plum. Everyone was looking this way with a smile as if it was funny.Chung-Myung's eyes last turned to Jo-Gol.\"\u2026\u2026I think I misunderstood\u2026\u2026. No, I think so.\"Chung-Myung forced the corners of his mouth up.Let's not get carried away.Let's not get angry.If you get mad at these blue things, you'll be the same guy.\"Bur, are you taking it off?\"\"Yes.\"Jo-Gol smiled wickedly.\"That's how men get along. Come on, take it off. If you dance naked, get beaten up a little, you'll be reminded of your love for the death penalty.\"The curled corners of my mouth soared to the point where they reached my ears.\"Just.\"\"Huh?\"\"It's just sad.\"Oh, I can't pronounce it properly.Chung-Myung, who coughed up his mouth muscles, struggled to open his mouth.\"What about you, Ungum Sosukjo?\"\"Gwanju trains in the evening. So it's better not to think that the governor will help you. We're the only ones here right now.\"\"I see.\"Chung-Myung nodded slowly.\"And even if there's an official, he's safe today. Now you have to live here from now on, do you think you can run away?\"Right. I have to live here from now on.Thank you.I was a little mistaken.\"So you're saying there aren't any saunas here?\"\"He keeps talking. I can't do this. Let's start after you get hit. I didn't like you at all.\"Jo-Gol jumped out of his seat and strode up and grabbed Chung-Myung by the collar.\"Once you get hit, you'll have respect for the death penalty. It's not that I don't like you. You use the rod of love to guide a crooked priest to the right path. Do you understand?\"\"Death penalty.\"\"What, do you have anything to say?\"\"Stretch your neck.\"\"Huh?\"At that moment, Chung-Myung's fist raised Jo-Gol's lower jaw.Bang!Jo-Gol's body soared to the ceiling with the sound of something exploding.Coozik!Then it goes through the old ceiling.It's hanging.Jo-Gol's body, whose neck is very stuck in the ceiling, shakes still.Stay still. Very still.The eyes of the three great disciples popped out when they saw the scene.\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung, who saw Jo-Gol stuck in the ceiling, turned around and approached the door.\"Uh, where are you going...\u2026.\"Rattling!Chung-Myung, who lifted the latch and locked the door, turned around with a bright smile.\"In human life.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"There are times when I worry about this and that.

Yes, it's first to clean up the surroundings.\"Chung-Myung lifted his leg and stepped down on the chair next to him. A wooden chair is broken into pieces. Chung-Myung grabbed the leg of the most intact chair.\"Hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooah.And he said, grinding his teeth.\"But I'm a man of my own, and I'm a man of my own.\"The words raised hope in the eyes of the children.My superiors...\"If you hear it, you'll be disturbed. Never scream. I'll double the screaming bastard.\"Oh...We weren't the top people.Of course.\"Let's get hit first.

I'll do my best.\"I put a lot of strength into my hand that was rubbing my shoulder.\"What's your name?\"\"It's Yoon-Jong!\"\"Are you the ambassador?\"\"Yes, I am!\"Chung-Myung's head turned slightly back. Moon-Jong's face, which has become a night owl, catches his eye.\"But I'm treating you because you're the big brother.\"\"Thank you!\"\"Give me a hand.\"\"Yes!\"Chung-Myung kicked his tongue and turned his head to the front again as the lines of Yoon-jong began to massage his shoulders hard.The death penalty with their heads on the floor in line is noticeable.\"People... ...\"Everyone flinches when Chung-Myung opens his mouth. It was a strange sight to see the people with their heads on the floor wince.\"\u2026\u2026if you want to live a quiet life, you have to help. Don't you think so, death penalty?\"Yes!\"\"We were thoughtless!\"Chung-Myung sighed.Who was Chung-Myung?It is the world's top three prosecutors. He was also recognized as the chief prosecutor of the world's top three prosecutors, and was nothing short of an informal world first, except for Heavenly Demon.You don't need a history to deal with these little kids.No matter how weak it is, Chung-Myung can't handle 3,000 people, not 30 children.\"I understand the initiation. But you have to do the initiation like a human being. There are things to do and things not to do at the conduit. Do you think people who want to be masters have to play so low?\"Everyone grumbled without answering.\"Why are you so old-fashioned?'I feel like I'm being criticized by a private dorm.'I don't feel like talking to my peers.Chung-Myung clicked his tongue at those death penalty.'I can't believe I'm doing this kind of thing.'The more I think about it, the more ridiculous I am.\"Wake up.\"As soon as the horse fell, the children rose like lightning.\"No matter how screwed up he is, this is what the cleanest kids in the city look like.\"Chung-Myung clicked his tongue.\"I need to get my mind back on track!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The children crept into each other's eyes.'No, that's just crawling in.'Who said he was a loser? Oh, my God.'Oh no. We have to live together now.'It was literally like a portrait house.No wonder.If you live with a master, you may have a place to run away, but the three great disciples must live in a white plum house. Where can a rabbit sleep comfortably if a criminal with a bad personality and a criminal with a bad personality come into the place where rabbits lived together?\"Tsk.\"Chung-Myung burst his eyes once and opened his mouth.\"First of all.\"\"Yes!\"\"Here's the death penalty I'm most familiar with the situation in Hasan, hand!No one opened their mouth.But their gaze was obviously turning to one side.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol opened his eyes when he saw the eyes of the death penalty focused on him.\"Hand.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"So-on!\"Jo-Gol's hand goes up helplessly.We'll see, you bastards!Still, how many years have passed since you sold the death penalty? You have no conscience!Jo-Gol gritted his teeth and reluctantly stepped forward.With his head up straight, he looks down at Chung-Myung. Chung-Myung frowned when he saw his chin and his eyes falling down.\"Jo-Gol's death penalty.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes.\"\"No matter how hard the death penalty is, isn't that head too stiff?\"\"Well, that's not it.\"Jo-Gol scurried up his hand and knitted his back of the neck.\"I'm stuck earlier, and I can't bend my neck to see what's wrong.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung stood up with a small tongue.\"Follow me into the room.\"\"...yes.\"\"Other executions, go to your room and rest today. No matter what I do, I'll start tomorrow.\"\"Yes.\"\"Follow the death penalty.\"Chung-Myung flicked his fingers up and Jo-Gol followed him like a cow being dragged to the slaughterhouse.As soon as the images of the two disappeared, the remaining three disciples flocked to Yoon-jong.\"Are you all right?\"\"Do I look all right?\"\"\u2026\u2026no.\"Yoon-jong caressed his chestnut eyes. The sad thing was, even the eyes now so nightly will be fine by tomorrow.If it's obvious, the dorms will take care of course.'I can't do anything about going in a rush and snitching, but even if I try to show it, he treats and recovers his body on his own. By tomorrow morning, everyone will be fine as if they were beaten.In other words.'That's all you've ever thought about.'The more I think about it, the scarier I am.\"What do we do now?\"\"What can I do? What can I do?\"\"Do you go to bed once?\"\"\u2026\u2026Do you want to do it?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Everyone has become dumb as a bee. In their heads, Chung-Myung, who was running wild like a beast a while ago, came to mind.'No, I can't do this.'If you don't do it right, you're dead.'Yoon-jong shivered. When I think of Chung-Myung, who was flipping his eyes and hitting the leg of the chair, my dry mouth automatically.\"By the way.\"Then someone brought up something that no one thought of.\"Why was the priest Jo-Gol taken?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"* * *\"Sit comfortably.\"\"\u2026\u2026I'll stand by.\"\"Don't worry, sit down. I'm not going to hit you.\"\"That's not it.\"Jo-Gol mumbled a little and then opened his mouth.\"I'm stuck in the ceiling and I can't bend my back to see what's wrong. It's comfortable to stand.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung coughed up.\"Sure.\"\"Why did you call me...\u2026.\"\"Let's talk comfortably, death penalty.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes?\"\"It's strange that the death penalty uses honorifics to priests. Feel free to say it.\"\"Yes.\"\"Don't be so hard on me.\"\"Yes.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung smacked his lips.Well, you'll get better in life. It's not just today.\"But why did you call me?\"\"Oh, I have a few questions. I want you to answer in detail as much as you know.\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung slowly opened his mouth.\"I know.\"\"Yes.\"\"Most of the children here are children of merchant families?\"\"Yes, it is.\"\"Hmmm.\"Chung-Myung tapped on the cheek with his fingers.A merchant.In the past, there was a lot of restraint from merchant families who wanted to enter Hawasan. However, Hawasan would not accept a merchant family member as a disciple if he could.Because merchants are mean?I don't think so.As long as he's in a position, he doesn't think it's vulgar to be a merchant. The problem is that the children of the shopping district generally come to learn martial arts, not to become students of Hwasan.What difference does that make?In the case of beginners other than merchant families, they often enter Hawasan with a desire to bury their bones. After entering the school and training, he became a senior member of Hawasan and led him.However, those who come from the shopping district remain disciples of their families, learn only the martial arts that are allowed, and then grow up and return to their families.Although the secular world does not forget the status of Hawasan's disciple and cooperates with him, it cannot be compared to the disciples who remain in the main mountain. The disciples who went down to the world as disciples of the inner family are of great financial help, but it is the disciples of the main family who lead and protect Hawasan.'Most of them are shopping malls...\u2026.'This means that the three great disciples, who seemed to have a large number, are all those who will escape from Wasan after they grow up.It's an apricot with a nice light.'The anger rose, but I also understood the long-written man's thoughts. No matter how many times they are told to get away, it is better to fill in the inner house than to have no disciples right away. If the number of students decreases, the price of wasan will be cut off.\"But why are the executions here?\"\"What do you mean?\"\"If it's a shopping mall, I'm sure you have some information, and you know things aren't good in Wasan. Why did you come all the way here?\"\"Oh, it's....\"Jo-Gol scratched his head.\"Actually, my family didn't plan to send me to Hawaii. However, there were not many civilizations who could enter my family with the financial power. Despite the collapse of Hawasan, there are still many other folk songs in the world. I don't know about the strong lake, but that connection gives me a lot of strength in the shopping mall.\"\"Hmmm.\"According to Jo-Gol, it means that the children of the shopping district who are here are not much to see. I don't mean anything bad. A merchant is eventually determined by the money he has.If they had a lot of money, they would not have entered the collapsing Hawasan. He would have paid more money to go to the gate.\"Then it means that the families of the three great disciples have no money to lose. I'm sure you got the right money when you started, and you're still living in a mess even though you got it.'I had a throbbing headache.It occurred to me that the long death penalty used to hold on to the books and wrap its head around the end of the year. At that time, he said that he was too obsessed with money because he was a master of death penalty, but now that I think about it, it is a remark that deserves to be beaten with books.People need money to make ends meet. Just because you're a doin doesn't mean you only eat dew.\"Hmm. So...\u2026.\"\"Yes.\"\"You're all going to learn how to fight properly and then go downstairs and go back to the family?\"\"Usually so.\"\"That's why discipline is so messed up.\"There can be no affection for a place where you only come to hang a sign in moderately. That's why we're having this ridiculous initiation, and the death penalty is working together to make a big deal out of it.\"For now, I get it. Get out, death penalty.\"\"Sure\u2026\"\"Oh, and.\"\"What?\"\"When does your routine start here?\"\"It's early in the morning (7 a.m.)\"\"Tell the kids to get everything ready by the beginning of the grave (5 a.m.) tomorrow and gather in front of them.\"\"Yes?\"\"Mystery candle.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes.\"\"And put the death penalty on the table and prepare what I say from now on.\"\"We have to get together tomorrow morning, so what do you want me to prepare?\"\"You don't like it?\"\"There's no way I don't like it. Please leave it to me.\"\"Oh, I like your aggressive attitude.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"After a while, Jo-Gol, who heard Chung-Myung's instructions, left the room with a subtle look. And sadly, his room was next to Chung-Myung's, so he couldn't escape far away.Chung-Myung, who heard the distant footsteps of Jo-Gol, sprawled on the bed.'Cheonleot-gil is a step forward.'I don't know who said this first, but he's a very comfortable person.When are you taking a step back when you're going a thousand miles. Moreover, Chung-Myung's path was not just a thousand miles away. It is a long and rough road that requires a long way to go even after going to Guman-ri.But it's still a step forward.'And that one step will begin with these guys.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And the energy accumulated in it has grown to a size that can be recognizable.Whoosh whoooow.In the midst of the intake, the gathered energy resonated and purified his body.Clear energy.As Chung-Myung, who has lived with him for decades, the transparent and clear energy that he has never seen before is gathered in his Danjeon. Right now, it will be difficult to exert great power because the size of the history is not large, but if these clear energy accumulates and builds up, it will exert greater power than any other history in the world.\"\u2026\u2026when.\"Chung-Myung, who finished his work, distorted his face.Freeze to death to exert great power. When are we waiting for this? I'm afraid we're going to ruin it.Chung-Myung, who pressed down on a burgeoning canvas, began to analyze the situation.Let's get this straight.'The problems of Hawasan are riddled with a myriad of them. The problem is that I can't use up all the paper in Wasan. However, the most important issues were three.\"No money, no martial arts, no talent.\"Then we're screwed.It was terrible even when I was vaguely thinking about it, but when I organized it, it turned my stomach more violently.So what's the biggest problem among them?Talent.Chung-Myung's idea was simple and clear.Money can be earned, and martial arts can be given what he has. Of courseWhere the hell did you get this martial arts?'It may not be normal to turn it over naturally without hearing it, but it is only a matter of process.But even with Chung-Myung's power, In Jae-man couldn't do anything about it.He can't run out to the streets to save Hawasan and kidnap children with good qualities. And qualities don't come out on the surface.If that happens, the elite will be searching through the children with their eyes on them.So we need to use the ones who are here.'Chung-Myung clenched his fists.What difference does it make to blame the poor? The first priority is to make good use of what is there.It is clear that the qualities of the three great disciples are not so good that they do not look good, but if they are lacking, they can be filled in, and if they are broken, they can be fixed.\"Of course I didn't have a disciple.\"It reminds me of the old days.When it was time for him to get a disciple when he was old enough, Jang Moon-sa asked him.-Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161.-Yes, long death.It's time for you to receive your disciples. How do you think you should teach your student?- Is there anything difficult about that?How?-You just have to beat it. When a dog is beaten to death, it walks on its hands. It's a human cub, but it's worse than a dog.I'll talk to you later.And Jang Moon-sa never brought up his disciple again.\"I didn't expect to receive so many students at once.\"Chung-Myung's mouth corners rolled up. If anyone had seen that smile, they would say it was a wicked smile.* * *\"\u2026\u2026I'm getting sleepy.\"\"Why are you telling me not to get together at dawn?\"\"Metabolism, isn't this too much?\"Yoon-jong closed his eyes still.'Just be quiet. You bastards.'Hawasan's discipline is rather strict, but these children are not yet completely free from worldly times. Even if it is not a prestigious house where the masterpiece lives, everyone was not used to enduring inconvenience and persevering because they were children of families living in their own regions.This is why he complains only half a day after being clubbed.Yoon-jong looked up slightly and looked at Jo-Gol. At least Jo-Gol is keeping his mouth shut if he has grasped the air.WellIt's not that the others didn't quite get the hang of it. So even with all the complaints, you must have gathered at this crack of dawn.Yoon-jong stared at the white plum with a dreary gaze.Where's that monster coming from?'Be in the eye.Chung-Myung wields his chair legs in a demon-like manner and immediately throws away children over 30 years old.Brrrrrr.Thinking about it makes me chills.\"\u2026\u2026but who the hell is he?\"The words were speaking for everyone.\"You were counting without answering.\"\"I haven't even touched it.\"\"There were more than thirty of them. Would you be able to do that if you were a housekeeper?\"I don't know.However, one thing is certain that none of the three great disciples can imitate similarly.\"The fact that a kid who just started yesterday is that he's learned martial arts somewhere else, right?\"\"Hey, no matter how hard it. It's not like we've been playing until now, does it make sense?\"Everyone was confused by the incomprehensible situation.Even Yoon-jong, who is older and has lived in Hwasan for the longest time, can't understand the situation now, so would other children be surprised?\"Why don't we go for it again?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"I don't know who said it, but this raised the mood.\"Is it possible?\"\"Maybe it was because we were embarrassed last night...\u2026.\"\"What if I fail?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"It was a cold family. Everyone turned their heads. Jo-Gol, who was in a floating position, was talking with his mouth open.\"If you don't want to be beaten to death, just shut up and do as you're told.\"\"\u2026\u2026Jo-Gol's death penalty.\"Jo-Gol, the best of the three great disciples, was shaking.\"Crazy people.\"What?You want me to hit you again?You have to be beaten up and stuck in the ceiling before you can say that's what you can't say. Jo-Gol was also confident in his skills. Jo-Gol is a description that any literary group would call a genius, even though it is called Hawasan, which has lost its edge compared to the past.In the end, Muhak is something people learn. Even if there was not enough teaching and good martial arts, he was confident that he could deal with most of the prestigious disciples.That confidence flew over Hwasan to the vast ocean with a punch stuck in his jaw.That's not a guy who can judge by common sense.\"But why did you ask me to prepare this?\"The three great disciples tilted their heads looking at the strange tools in front of them.\"I know. I don't know what it's for.\"A long wooden stick and a big, strong pocket that will make a person's head fit. And\"Why do you want me to prepare sand and gravel? What's wrong with the ring?\"\"Can you tell?\"As everyone was muttering, the door burst open.\"\u2026\u2026.\"It's getting quiet.The babbling mouth closes in unison, and everyone's eyes are focused on the door. Soon Chung-Myung trudged out.However, the look is full of annoyance and irritation.\"Why are you bothering me?\"\"If you're bothered, don't make me gather!'Chung-Myung, who stopped with Tulleena, looked up and looked around everyone once.\"Are you all here?\"\"Yes!\"\"Be quiet. They're waking up.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Crack, crack.Chung-Myung, who twisted his head once from side to side, opened his mouth.\"Anyway, aren't we going to live together in the future? I don't know what's going to happen, but maybe we'll be together for the rest of our lives on death row.\"'I'll go home even if I die.'We're going down. We're going down by all means!'It was a remark that even those who decided to bury their bones in Hawasan as a true disciple after receiving the slogan changed their minds.\"But I think you guys...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung grinned.\"Too weak.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The most insulting and disgraceful word for those who master martial arts is \"weak.\" Even those who think they should learn how to play fair and go back and live as merchants can't stand this.\"Yes.\"However, the problem was that there was no room for contradiction.It was said by a person who knocked down people over 30 by himself, but did not even touch them, let alone hit them. Even if the sky is red, I can't deny it.\"Well, I think so, too. War is not everything in life. By the way, you guys are the ones who decided to learn martial arts in Hawasan. Then you should be strong. Don't that right?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"So from today, you will train with me every dawn. It's good, right?\"It can't be good. Dude!Someone raised their hand when they saw Chung-Myung talking shamelessly.\"Tell me.\"\"Do we have to do this?\"Chung-Myung looked at the person who asked the question with a sour eye and turned to Yoon-jong.Soon-jong, who was frozen, mumbled and opened his mouth.\"Not everyone was there at the time\u2026\u2026.\"\"Oh, right.\"Some of us didn't get hit.There are also those who did not attend the ceremony. I've heard of it in words, but some people can't understand the situation by themselves.\"Can anyone who doesn't want to go in?\"\"But you're new, why do you keep talking down to me? You have to be polite, though.\"Chung-Myung nodded as if he was right.\"Yes, people should be polite. In that sense, I have no intention of becoming strong and training. Hand!\"When a hundred people come together, there must be one or two people who don't have a clue. When those two raised their hands, some more people, who were slowly reading the room, raised their hands.About a dozen.\"Good, good. War is not everything in life. Come on, you guys go inside.\"\"Can I go?\"\"Sure.\"The faces of Yoon-jong and Jo-Gol turned pale.'You stupid bastards. It's not \"Go in\", it's \"Go in\"'\"You're walking into hell on his own. You're an old man. Look out for those bastards.\"The children, who didn't know anything, smiled brightly and went into the white plum. And Chung-Myung smiled brightly and followed.Like this.The door closes neatly.\"\u2026\u2026.\"No one had the heart to open their mouth and watched the white plum.Contrary to expectations, no screams or shouts were heard.but'That's...\u2026'Yoon-jong saw it clearly. The large white plum hall is swaying slightly. It was obvious that you didn't see what was going on inside.After a very short time.Squeak.The door opens slowly again.And in it, the children sprinted out with all their might with faces as if they had seen a ghost. Then, he went back to his original position and stood close to him in a floating position.\"Tsk.\"Chung-Myung, who came out with his head turned, opened his mouth again.\"Someone who doesn't want to train.\"\"No!\"\"Be quiet, I told you. They're waking up.\"\"None.\"\"Growl.\"Chung-Myung claps as if he was moved.\"The instructor is very pleased with your desire to be strong. The future of Hwasan is bright. So I will make you strong at all costs.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Let's get started.\"Yoon-jong closed his eyes as he saw the sun coming up far away.I don't know if the future of Hawasan is bright, but their future is bleak.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If anyone was awake, someone would have woken up Moon An-jo, meaning that all the children in the White House were still asleep.Come to think of it.'Yesterday, I remembered that a new child had entered the white pipe.\"They're...\u2026.\"The crybaby frowned slightly.I already knew that children were doing weird things about hazing or something. You'll have to quit as a teacher, but children in a group need a bond.Jo-Gol he works without knowing the end, but as long as Yoon-Jong was around, he would be able to sort things out before there was a big problem.However, the fact that Moon An-jo does not come in time may mean that yesterday's welcoming ceremony was a little extreme.The fortune-teller quickly changed his clothes as he narrowed his brows. Dressed up in a coat, a dagger around his waist, he hurriedly opened the door and went outside.I'm gonna have to teach him a lesson first.'The Ungum's determined steps headed for the White House.It was the moment when I saw the white plum, I thought I should wake up the children who fell asleep.\"Go....\"\"Gal!\"The sword, which tried to scream loudly, breathed in and stopped without being able to spit it out. At the same time, his eyes grow as big as a flame.\"What, what is this?'I raised my hand and rubbed my eyes. There was a strange sight before his eyes.What is it, hell?'I had a strange idea for a while, but the fortune-teller came to his senses.This is Hwasan! So what's happening in front of us is what's happening in Wasan.But I couldn't understand why this scene was unfolding.You're not looking at anything in vain.The empty cloud sword, which had finished its eyes, looked at the view again with a wistful sound. But what it looks like hasn't changed a bit.\"Uh...\u2026.\"A despairing moan is heard in the ear of the Ungum, who groans vaguely because he doesn't know what to react to.\"Oh, my God. Oh, my God!\"\"Oh, my. I'm dying. Oh, my.\"\"Mom... ..take me home.\"The Ungum stared blankly at the groaning children.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Is this really the kids I used to know?That's what a child is. Sometimes, that ignorance causes anger, and adultery causes disappointment.However, children who maintain their innocence have a sense of liveliness that makes the viewer warm.But there was not a trace of life in the children in front of them now.What kind of kids are you wearing?'Where are all the fluffy(?) kids he used to know, and only the crappy ones rolling around?The fortune-teller looked everywhere with astonishing eyes.\"Turn it off.\"\"I'm going to die... ..I'm going to die.\"The crybaby, which looked closely at the faces of the rolling children, blinked its eyes.I think my sons are right.'A little... no, quite a lot worse, but those black ones were obviously the Sons of the Ungum and celadon ships based in the White Plum.What the hell did you do?'What do you mean the kids who were so soft until yesterday end up in a house overnight?Wood swords and pockets were scattered around the ragged children.What's that?The fortune-teller could see what he had to do. If you have a limit to guessing, you don't have to think hard. Don't you have more than a hundred mouths here to answer his questions?\"What the hell is going on?\"My head moves as soon as I open my mouth. The children, who were lying on the floor and groaning, looked at the Ungum in unison.The half-dead children's eyes are alive!\"Sasukjo!\"\"Sasukjo-nim!\"\"Oh, my God!\"It sounded a little strange at the end, but for now it was clear that the children were welcoming him violently. He's about to shed tears.It was unusual for him, whose mission was to control the children. No, it's not uncommon, but it's the first time I've ever seen those children so enthusiastically welcome me.\"Coughing! Homestead!\"\"Why are you here so late! Why!\"\"I've missed you so much, Sasookjo!\"What should I say?Strangely, I was proud of the fact that the children, who had always been wary, welcomed me so violently. An unknown emotion is flooding in.But soon the Woongeom, who came to his senses, shook his head quickly.'Oh, no.'This is not the time to be moved by this.Look at the bones of the children. The appearance of being covered with soil and sweat seems to have been at war. Looking at the pitifully trembling arms and legs, the heart of the fortune-teller is likely to turn over even more upside down.\"What the hell is going on here?\"The children, who seemed to be about to hold onto the sword and shed tears at any moment, hesitated and silent when the questions fell. However, he glances to the back.\"Do you read the room.The eyes of the Ungum moved along with those of the children. There was Jo-Gol, sitting down and opening his mouth wide.\"Jo-Gol?\"\"\u2026\u2026No. After that.\"\"After that?\"The gaze that was fixed on Jo-Gol is more backwards.\"What about him?\"Ungum's eyes, which seemed to have never been able to get bigger, overcome the impossible and expand a little more.The new guy?'Did I say my name is Chung-Myung? But what is he doing now?The sword tilted its head. Chung-Myung was doing something bizarre. He is carrying a wooden sword on his shoulder, which has several large pockets.\"What's that pocket?\"\"It's a dirt bag.\"\"\u2026\u2026Why the dirt bag?\"I asked, but I thought I already knew.purpleAmong the upper floors, the exceptionally dry upper house hangs a dirt bag bigger than my head on the wooden sword and bends over it.\"Gasp.\"I felt like I was sweating and putting strength into the sword I was looking at.As if he would fall down any minute, he stands up, shaking and trying to balance himself.Click, click.Drops of sweat dripped down my chin. My whole body was sweating, so I was emitting steam.'Isn't that how he's gonna die?'Watching his red-hot face, his veins, veins, and distorted face like the devil of hell, the sword naturally strengthened itself.There will never be another image in the world that is more firm than I am to express the word \"hard.\" Chung-Myung, who is stretching his body, bends again with a groaning sound.'You're gonna die, man!'It's not because Ungum is a generous man. In fact, he is more disciplined than anyone else. The iron becomes harder as it beats, and the stronger a person trains. He was a person who would applaud rather than stop his disciples if they had a hard training.However, even with such luck, Chung-Myung's training has gone too far.'No, then why are these guys so ugly...\u2026?'You were training with me?\"Sar, sir! Help me.\"\"You're going to die.\"Come to think of it, the children's whole bodies are soaked in sweat. It feels like wearing clothes that were washed out quickly because they were wet. It gives me goosebumps to think that all that damp water is sweat.\"So they weren't all asleep?'You've been training since dawn, and you're saying this is what happened?\"\u2026\u2026Since when have you been doing this?\"\"It's the beginning of the grave.\"You're saying he's been doing that for more than an hour?\"\u2026\u2026why?\"It was a natural question, but no one answered it. Just.If you say that, we'll die.'I was just desperately putting on a face that said.'No way?'No, I don't think so. No way.Does that make any sense?The children here are the three great disciples of Hawasan. No matter how much Hawasan is not the same as before, they are trained in martial arts. Among the three great disciples, there were many children who had mastered martial arts for more than five years. Compared to those who have not mastered martial arts, it is inevitable that they will be far stronger.And you're saying they can't handle that little kid and they're getting this?Now, hold on.'Isn't Jo-Gol, famous for his high position and good skills among the three great disciples, just breathing on the floor?'Yoon-Jong\u110b\u1173\u11ab?'Ungum's eyes quickly found Yoon-jong, the great disciple.\"Huh\u2026\u2026\"Objects that appear to have been Yoon-Jong are scattered on the floor.What happened to her?'Jo-Gol still maintains the skeleton of a human being, but Yoon-Jong is no longer a human being. Seeing Yoon-jong breathing hard with his face on the ground and his hips slightly raised, tears are likely to gather around his eyes.\"He\u2026\u2026.\"The sword opened its mouth and closed it again.'No, it's good to train, but.'Now I know what I did. Isn't it obvious when you look at Chung-Myung? The children must have come out from dawn and worked out their muscles.Although Hawasan is a long-term inspection of speed and splendor, he also does basic muscle training. The basis of all martial arts is to start with the body.\"But what does it take to make healthy children get out of the human skeleton in just one sight?'The sword raised his hand and wiped the sweat from his forehead.When I looked away, the children were all looking at him with sparkling eyes. It is full of hope and belief that the Ungum will solve this situation.Don't look like that with your eyes.It's really a serious burden.\"Khhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\"The Ungum, who calmed his mind by coughing, turned to Chung-Myung. First of all, we need to figure out how this is going. It is after that that that determines how to react.\"Bring that child.\"It was the moment when the name \"Chung-Myung\" was firmly stuck in my mind.And the current fortune-teller did not know that it would be the most important name in his life.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sweat drops drop down along the sleeves even though I'm just standing still.The face, flushed with blood, was about to burst, and the legs standing trembled to see how exhausted it was. Even his lips were trembling.\"Oh, will you sit down?\"Ungum, who considers manners and norms as his life, unwittingly recommended Chung-Myung to sit down.This can't be helped.It's the same reason that everyone wants to reach out when they see a puppy in the rain. I'm sure Chung-Myung looks a lot worse off now than a wet puppy.\"Oh, it's okay. More water than that...\u2026.\"\"Someone go get some water! Now!\"\"Yes!\"One of the children, who was slowly reading the room, runs to get some water.\"Yes, the\u2026\u2026.\"But the fortune-teller shut his mouth again.What should I ask you?'I sang it, but I don't know where to start. It's the first time I've had such a ridiculous situation.\"What the hell is going on here?\"So I had no choice but to ask the obvious.Chung-Myung, who was asked by the Ungum, looked around and opened his mouth calmly.\"It's not a big deal.\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"\"From today, we were all going to do early morning exercises together, but I think I worked out a little too much without thinking about the first day. It must have happened because everyone was motivated.\"Are you full of motivation?The Ungum glances at the children behind Chung-Myung. The children were shaking their hands desperately with their mouths shut.However, Chung-Myung turns his head back and the hands of the children quickly fall.\"Look at this.\"It is absolutely absurd. I don't know what the hell's going on, but one thing is for sure. All three great disciples were intimidated by this one child.A fortune teller is not a tactless man. It's been almost a decade since I've only been with children. Now, just by looking at the children's eyes rolling, most of the time we find out how the situation is going.No, it's weird that you don't notice it when you see it even if you don't reach that far.\"Hwasan's disciples...\u2026.'You're scared of a new guy?The sword's head was slightly tilted sideways.'No, I don''Come to think of it, these children's skills are by no means low. Most uncrowned children of the same age won't even look up in front of him.Even if it rots, it's still wasan.So, those kids aren't pathetic, this guy is weird.\"Did you say dawn exercise?\"\"Yes, I am.\"\"Hey.\"The Ungum said firmly.\"There is a rule of white plumage. Who told you to cut down on your bedtime and train?\"There was no change in Chung-Myung's face even though he slightly mixed old age. She still keeps her calm and opens her mouth as if it is no big deal.\"Then I won't do it.\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"\"I thought training would help. But since you said no, I won't.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Uh, this isn't it.The Woongeom was a little embarrassed. This is not the reaction he hoped for.\"Su, you thought training would help?\"\"Yes.\"\"Why did you think so?\"Chung-Myung's eyes are young in bewilderment.\"That doesn't help?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"A little awkward air passed between the two.'Yes.'The Ungum, who made a deep groaning sound, warmed his mouth. Chung-Myung opened his mouth first as if he knew all the feelings of such a fortune-telling.\"I thought it would be enough for the Sasukjo to teach me, but I thought the disciples had their own way of trying. All martial arts come from the body, so I thought that if I could train the body, it could help the sword.\"That's the right thing to say.It was an opinion that had no place to point out.\"You're right.\"The fortune-teller also readily acknowledged the fact.\"One, can you say that the training caused by coercion is right?\"\"Pressure?\"Chung-Myung glances back and laughs.\"Hey, hoarder. Who am I to be so hard on the death penalty. When I said I would train, I just followed the death penalty because I wanted to join.\"That's nonsense.It was an obvious lie.But in order to question this lie, you have to say, \"Didn't you bring the death penalty out of fear?\"By the way...I can't say that.'This is the sound of dying altogether.The three great disciples become idiots who were beaten and dragged out yesterday because they could not handle a new recruit, and the fortune-teller becomes a figurehead who teaches the idiot.And doesn't Chung-Myung beat up the death penalty and become a cowardly villain when he's the youngest?If you say that, everyone will be ruined.\"He\u2026\u2026.\"Just as Ungum was about to find something to say, Chung-Myung quickly opened his mouth.\"As long as it doesn't affect other training, it can be a good training method. The results will come out in at least a month.\"\"Whoa?'Though he talks about training with his mouth, his hidden intentions were slightly different.A monthIt means leave it alone for about a month. In other words, it can produce solid results.\"Look at this guy.\"It doesn't sound like a young man's horse. Isn't an old-fashioned Kang Ho-in using a speech that hides his meaning in words?The rhyme struck a hint.\"A month, maybe. But the training itself doesn't seem that simple, so can children train for a month?\"\"The will of the death penalty is so high that I want to emulate it. No one complained even though it was a hard training session.\"I tried rolling it once, but there was no one who could open his mouth. It means don't worry because it's been made so hard to talk about it off.\"No, where did this guy crawl in from?'While the sword cannot hide its absurdity, Chung-Myung turns around and smiles at the three great disciples.\"Isn't that so? Death penalty?\"\"\u2026\u2026he, of course.\"\"I can do my best. Hard.\"\"\u2026\u2026I worked hard today as well.\"Chung-Myung turns around again.\"How can the will of the death penalty be so high that the results of the training are not good?\"The faces of the kids in the back are going to rotting.I was speechless because I was amazed. But in the meantime, the Ungum's head began to spin fast.So Chung-Myung's words mean that although a day has passed, he has already taken full control of the three great disciples, and that he will use his grip to train them without wasting it.And if he had a different mind, it meant he'd have to wait and see for a month or so and it'd be over.'Come on.'The more I hear it, the more absurd it is. Suddenly, where did this monstrous creature roll in and subdue the children?But...It's not a bad story for me.'The biggest problem he has as a white plum is that it is difficult to secure training time.Hwasan is always understaffed.Originally, the White House was not a place he could handle alone. At least ten instructors were needed. But now there are only three people who are committed to helping him.As a result, the day went by just cleaning up the children, and his growth as an unmanned man was stagnant. It was self-evident that this would be a great help to him if he could take control of the children.\"One more question.\"\"Yes.\"\"It won't be easy for you either, but why do you train from dawn?\"Chung-Myung tilts his head.\"I don't understand what you mean, Sasukjo.\"\"Hmm?\"There's no way this kid suddenly doesn't understand.\"To enter Hawasan means to learn the sword, and to learn the sword means to be strong. It is natural to train to be strong. It is the natural duty of the disciple who has been blessed by Hwasan to carve out the sword, and furthermore to spread the name of Hwasan.\"\"Well, yes.\"\"Of course, the teaching given by the Sasookjo will be strong enough, but I think we can speed it up if efforts are added. Wouldn't it be natural to save your sleeping time to try hard enough?\"\"\u2026\u2026right.\"I was asking what more reasons are needed for the training process.'I wondered what kind of wind Jang Moon-in, who said he would no longer accept his students, was newly introduced to the school.'Wouldn't a man like this be worth raising?I haven't confirmed my talent yet, but a man who is this motivated will be able to perform well even if he doesn't have talent. And even if you don't become a master, it's good to have a good influence on other children.\"\u2026\u2026you seem to be having a hard time with your training.\"\"It's because it's my first day.\"\"You look tired, though.\"\"The more you roll, the harder you become.\"The corners of the mouth of the sword trembled.'This is an item.'Doesn't it fit perfectly with the theory of the rhyme? I think it's okay to push him for a while if he has this kind of theory. Anyway, it was the same in the past that there was a hierarchy between children that was unrelated to distribution.\"What's important about dealing with the death penalty?\"\"Polite, I will obey your words like heaven.\"This means that he will maintain his hierarchy by respecting his superiors without looking down on them too much. I like each answer.The Ungum nodded loudly and looked around. Children who do not understand how the situation is looking at the Ungum with trembling eyes.\"Hmmm.\"The fortune-teller, who blew up his embarrassment with a cough, slightly avoided his eyes and opened his mouth.\"It was very touching that you guys were 'voluntarily' training from dawn.\"\"Household! Household!\"\"Gwanju!\"There was a shout of embarrassment and consternation, but the Ungum tried to ignore the voice.\"If we continue to train steadily, we will be able to achieve good results. I think this kid knows how to train, so try your best.\"I'm screwed.'Wow, this is how you throw it away.''Look at him avoiding his gaze.'There was despair on the faces of the disciples who recognized the thoughts of the Ungum.\"Then make sure you don't be late and come out to the morning training. Then I'll leave you alone.The sword stopped while trying to turn around.\"Oh, by the way!\"Of course!Still, you can't just abandon a person when he's giving you a white plum.\u2026.\"You don't have to say hello in the morning anymore because it will disturb your training. Training comes first. Oh, sure.\"The sword smiles and plans, and turns away.The disciples reached out without realizing it, but the fortune-telling disappeared in vain like a mirage that could not be caught.\"\u2026\u2026.\"I'makes a noise.At that moment, the screech of the neck rings.It's Chung-Myung. He turned slowly. And he smiled.Obviously, the blood on his forehead only makes the meaning of the smile unclear.\"Sasukjo, save me, please?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"And the death penalty, I'm not saying I'm going to kill them. Let's go inside before we eat. There's something I need to tell you in the white house.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Come on.\"\"...yes.\"It was a moment when dreams and hopes disappeared in Hawasan.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Ungum tilted its head at Unam's unexpected response.\"Didn't you know?\"\"I don't know?\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh. I thought the writer intentionally let the child in. Otherwise.\"\"It's not a situation where we can afford to find the article. It's a kid who walked in on his own feet.\"\"Because the long man said he was newly introduced...\u2026.\"The fortune-teller clouded the end of his words.It is a child accepted by a long writer who said he would no longer accept his disciples. So I thought there must be a story. Isn't that why you're trying to do that even though there's such a storm?But Unam really doesn't seem to know.\"If there's anything that only you know...\u2026?\"\"No, it's really a child who came on his own.\"\"\u2026\u2026it's an article.\"Unam held the charges.The more I think about it, the more bizarre it is.'The child, who suddenly came all the way here, suddenly said he wanted to be a disciple of Hwasan, and is doing something less than a day later.'That's too much to think about.'I wondered if it was a ganja sent by the other Moon faction to ruin Hwasan, but it was too much.First, Hawasan was no longer a civil servant worth anyone's effort to spoil, and secondly, even if he had that intention, it was almost impossible for that little child to have that ability.If you're a child with that ability, it's better to raise him with all your heart and soul than to send him to Ganza to rot.\"If I do, wouldn't it be better to stop her now?\"\"Let's leave it at that.\"\"One, death penalty.\"\"You didn't stop him because he had his own expectations.\"Instead of answering, the Ungum lowered his head slightly.\"I know your hard work. It's a natural duty as a ship to lead the disciples, but I also know that you're the only one who'\"\"That's not true. Capital punishment. I'm just...\u2026.\"\"It's all right.\"Unam laughed softly.\"Everyone's having a hard time. I don't know what he's thinking, but you don't have to stop it if it helps you and Hawasan.\"Ungum looked up and looked at Unam.\"I don't know exactly yet. The child....\"\"Lucky sword.\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"\"The child is now a disciple of Hawasan.\"The eyes of the sword shook slightly.\"Why don't I know that I'm a little more attached to the first child? However, even if he came later, he is a child of Hawasan who must be taken care of together as long as he has decided to write an enemy in Hawasan.\"\"\u2026\u2026I was foolish.\"The sword bowed its head slightly.\"If it's too much, you stop it. Don't you know more about the white plum than I do or the long man?\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"The crybaby rose from his seat.\"Then I'll be on my way.\"\"Go ahead.\"When Un-gum left, Un-am poured tea into the teacup.You're a weird kid.'There's definitely an extraordinary.He can't hide his presence for a day, so he must bring about drastic changes. Whether the change will be Hawasan's blessing or painting was unknown to Unam now.Just one thing.Change is needed.'Now there needs to be a new wind in Hawaii. Floating in the open sea with no wind will only dry you to death or starve you to death. Even if you don't know where you're going, you have to sail for now.Even if the end of the voyage is an uninhabited island, it would be better than dying in the open sea.Unam slowly took the car to his mouth.He hoped that Chung-Myung's presence would be the wind that would move Hwasan.Of course, it remains to be seen whether he will be so nonchalant even when he knows that the wind blowing is a typhoon.* * *\"I feel like I'm going to die.\"\"\u2026\u2026I'm already dead.\"A wailing came from all over the place. Now, of course, those who speak of death were the three great disciples of Hawasan.What, is this some kind of torture?'I know it's an exercise to build muscle strength. And it's not like I've been neglecting weight training just because I'm a Hawaiian. Muscle training is not neglected, even in the sound of the foundation of all central martial arts.But there's a degree to that.'Yoon-jong lowered his head and looked at the table.Stir-fried vegetables came out as a side dish, but my hands were shaking so much that I couldn't eat them properly, so there was stir-fried vegetables all over the table.\"Um... I can't even eat properly.\"\"I have to train my sword in the afternoon, and I'm afraid I'll miss it. It's a real sword, so if you swing it and miss it, isn't it going to be a hole in the back?\"\"...fortunately, I don't think I can swing it with that much power.\"\"Is that a relief?\"Yoon-jong sighed.'Tell me in front of you. In front of you.'If you have any complaints, why don't you go ahead and argue? What's the difference between what you say behind the scenes?\"There's nothing I can do.\"\"Metabolism!\"There was a sound of Bolmen coming from all over the place. But Yoon-Jong just silently picked up the stir-fried vegetables.What more can he do now that even the fortune-teller has sided with Chung-Myung?\"But if the death penalty doesn't speak to me at times like this...\u2026.\"\"Isn't that the position of ambassador?\"As soon as Yoon-Jong sighed and tried to speak, someone's shrill voice was heard.\"That's a hell of a lot to talk about.\"The eyes of the three great disciples who were filling the restaurant go back to one place in unison.\"Jo-Gol?\"There was a moment of silence. Jo-Gol, who was eating quietly in the corner, checked the gaze gathered at him and opened his mouth in a sharp voice.\"Is he your errand boy? There's no one hiding to talk to. If you have something to say, go and say it yourself.\"\"\u2026\u2026no, we\u2026\u2026.\"\"If you're not going to be able to argue in person, just be quiet and eat. If you don't eat, you won't be able to last in the afternoon.\"No one could open their mouth when Jo-Gol went this far.Yoon-jong's eyes caught my eye looking at Jo-Gol.That's weird.If he knows Jo-Gol, he should now speak louder than anyone else about Chung-Myung. Aren't you the most vocal and strongest of the three greatest disciples in the first place?When Jo-Gol secretly sided with Chung-Myung, it became difficult for everyone to open their mouths.Like this.Jo-Gol, who put down his chopsticks, gets up and approaches Yoon-Jong.\"Metabolism.\"\"Hmm?\"\"Can I see you for a moment?\"\"\u2026\u2026let's do it.\"Yoon-jong also left his chopsticks and stood up.The remaining disciples tilted their heads as they looked at the two people leaving the restaurant.\"I don't know if I'm looking at something wrong\u2026\u2026.\"When he came out to the deserted place, Yoon-jong opened his mouth first.\"You look quite refreshed, don't you think?\"Jo-Gol raised his hand and rubbed his face.\"Do you see that?\"\"You're not good at hiding facial expressions.\"\"I didn't know that.\"Jo-Gol smiled awkwardly.\"How could you roll and still laugh?\"\"\u2026\u2026the death penalty.\"\"Huh?\"\"What do you think of the death penalty?\"Yoon-jong shut up. It was too serious a question to answer casually.\"That's a tough question.\"\"I'm going to go back to my parents' house. But isn't the death penalty willing to bury bones in Hawasan?\"\"Right.\"Yoon-jong nodded still.He's already the one who's supposed to be called. The other three disciples have yet to make a choice, but he will be the disciple of Jinsan under the auspices of Hwasan and share his fate with him.\"Do you think there's a future in Hawaii?\"\"I'm going to be haunted. It's not something to say.\"\"I thought there wasn't.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"It's something to blame. But Yoon-Jong couldn't bring himself to do that. Because his thoughts were not so different from Jo-Gol's.\"Does that mean you've changed your mind now?\"\"\u2026\u2026a little bit.\"\"Different?\"\"I was forced to do it, but I realized it during this training. I've never trained to push myself to the limit like this.\"I'm sure he is.Yoon-jong nodded without realizing it. He's never done this kind of training either. I always thought I was trying, but I've never pushed myself so hard that my hands and feet tremble like now.\"But he's not exhausted, digesting more than twice the amount of training we do.\"It's not just a ship.The number of times alone is twice as many times. If you include weight, the strength of the training will be much higher. Yoon-jong was shocked to see Chung-Myung train with a sandbag heavier than his own weight.\"It's possible because you're strong. But he'll never be older than I am. It's not because you're strong, but because you've been, you're strong, right?\"\"You're right.\"\"I thought it was impossible for me to be strong in Wasan. I thought that I could not be a master who commanded the world, even if it was possible to show off my power in moderation.\"\"Jo-Gol.\"\"Listen till the end. Death penalty.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol swallowed a dry saliva and continued.\"But looking at him, I knew I was wrong. To put it bluntly, is there anyone at our age who can deal with him?\"I don't think so.There will never be.No matter how hard Yoon-jong was not the best of the three great disciples, he was confident in his skills. There is also confidence that it will not be pushed back too much even if it is attached to the disciples of the Old File Room.But that monstrous guy flipped over Yoon-jong with one finger and threw Jo-Gol, who was stronger than Yoon-Jong, into the ceiling.How could there be another monster like that?\"It doesn't matter which martial arts you learn. The important thing is how to learn. I thought the obvious truth was just a nice thing to hear. But looking at him, I can see that's true. Capital punishment. I want to do my best.\"\"\u2026\u2026I feel the same way.\"Jo-Gol nodded loudly.\"So the death penalty will comfort the children. Maybe this is an opportunity for our generation to change greatly. Even if it's a little hard and ugly, we have to follow him now.\"Yoon-jong looked at Jo-Gol with subdued eyes.Jo-Gol has good skills, but he was able to keep track of the flow because he was the self-restraint of the mall. If he were a merchant, he would be a merchant. If such a person talks like this...\u2026.\"Let's do it.\"\"The death penalty!\"\"You're right. Jukdo is just the way they never will be resolved. I'm the one who decided to bury the bones in Hawasan. I can do anything to help Hawasan.\"Jo-Gol nodded at Yoon-Jong's determined words.\"But it's funny to think about it. Just because of the youngest who came in yesterday...\u2026.\"\"I'm not usually the youngest.\"\"That's true.\"The two people, who smiled lightly, turned around. I'm done talking. Now it's a question of how much we can appease our children.\"Walk.\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"\"Can we really be strong?\"\"One thing is for sure.\"\"Hmm?\"\"If you don't get stronger, you can train as hard as you can.\"\"\u2026\u2026that's a very comforting thing to say.\"The two exchanged words and went back to the restaurant.

There was a rice ball next to him.'Oh, I wasn't such a benevolent person.'Now that he's in the restaurant, the death penalty won't be able to eat properly because they're too self-consciousness. At least let me eat comfortably. Wouldn't that be human nature?Chung-Myung tapped on the stomach and sighed.It started out louder than I thought.'Originally, I was going to die for a while and look around. But they didn't just pull out the sleeping tiger's nose hair, they stuffed fire skewers into their mouths.So it can't be helped, can it? There are things in the world that you can and can't stand.\"What's past is inevitable.\"It was fortunate that Woon-gum was a person who could communicate. I poked him and he understood me and pushed Chung-Myung. Thanks to you, things went easier than I thought.Of course, we've prepared all the ways to deal with the situation when the prosecutor went in a different direction, but it's true that it's a little troublesome.It's smarter than I thought.'Smart.\"\u2026\u2026Smart?\"Ungum is obviously a death row for Chung-Myung. But it's also his great quality. Isn't it a compliment to use the word intelligent to Sa Sook-jo, but to use the word intelligent to Jeung-jil?\"Yes, it's complicated.\"I thought I would have to spend more time to organize it would be organized. I feel that his position within Hasan has not yet been clarified.By the way....\"These two guys are definitely smart.\"Chung-Myung's eyes turned to Yoon-jong and Jo-Gol entering the restaurant.When people are gathered this much, there must be people who stand out. In Chung-Myung's view, those two were the key disciples.\"I've got a good idea.\"It is quite admirable, is it not? Normally, this roll is killing me. Sound should not stop at the mouth, but is motivated, not complaining? This is something that even Chung-Myung has to admire.Especially Jo-Gol.It was great that the beaten man ruled out grudges and looked at the situation coolly. In the meantime, he is confident that he can become stronger if he follows Chung-Myung. If I have any money left, I want to leave it to him.\"It would be useful to raise them well.\"Chung-Myung smirked and bit the rice ball.They're them, but more importantly, Chung-Myung.First of all, building a body is the first thing.'The foundation was roughly stacked. There is still a long way to go, but the most dangerous section is over. So now we have to learn martial arts in earnest.So what do you need most at this point?It's a perfect body.Now that you've returned to your young body with all that knowledge, you can be strong with meditation or thesis.You're welcome.\"Muhak is honest.\"Theory is theory, reality is reality. No matter how high you know martial arts, you can't exercise your power if you can't physique it.Training and physical conditioning cannot be done with the head. You must learn with your body by sweating.What you need more than anything else to do that is muscle strength.Hawasan's Black is swift and flashy?In other words, Hwasan's sword should be swung in the direction of a hundred arms with only his wrist. The sword is colorful, not the body.How to have strong roots to produce beautiful and colorful plum blossoms. The root of martial arts is the body.You can't just see what you want to see.'The public is drawn to Hawasan's splendid sword. But thanks to him, I don't see the colorful plum blossomer wielding a sword to die.Oh, d*mn it! What's so complicated? Can't we just stab him to death?Why do you have to twist it three times when you stab it in the face? I'm gonna break my wrist!The swan's legs, which swim smoothly on the water, flaps desperately. If Hawasan's fancy sword was a swan's body, the body that should swing the sword was a swan's leg.So you have to be disciplined and disciplined.Those children will be able to be born as a late-stage index with the strongest body in the world in about three years, even if they digest only the quarter of his training.By then, Hawasan may not be the most colorful sword-wearing literary group in the world, but rather the powerful literary group that slaps Shaolin's ears.Chung-Myung smiled and stood up.The problem isn't the chicks, it's the superiors.'The problem was that he couldn't roll the upper allocation, although the chicks would soon be able to get organized if he touched them. So I have to make myself strong...\u2026.I sigh when I think of the fortune-telling sword.It's not a bad quality.'Looking at the energy emitted from the body, you can feel how hard the Ungum has been trying.It is never easy for a person who has not been handed down a proper sword to reach that level. It would certainly be a good inspection if you could learn proper swordsmanship before it's too late.But how can I give you this?'Chung-Myung scratched his head.This is embarrassing.I wish I could throw it, but it would be a disaster. I don't have the confidence to deal with it. So you have to hand it over as naturally as possible so that it doesn't show. This...\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung scratched his head.I don't think I'm particularly smart, but I've been living my life thinking hard, so it was hard to find a solution in this case.\"Shall we go back for now?\"In order to find a solution, it is necessary to grasp the situation accurately for now.Exactly what the actual martial arts is. And the remaining martial arts must be checked to see if they are being transferred properly.* * *Jo-Gol swallowed a dry saliva as he watched Chung-Myung cross-legged in front of his eyes.'I think I'm wrong about that.'Being strong? Training?I like them all. I like them all.But to do that, you have to keep living with him like this.\"Can you hold on to this?\"'The more I think about it, the stronger I feel something is wrong.\"So....\"\"Yes.\"\"Say without honorifics, death penalty.\"\u2026\u2026yes.\"\"So this is it?\"\"Yes.\"\"Speak informally.\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung frowned at Jo-Gol's writing.\"Is this really all you have?\"\"I'm telling you...Yo.\"\"Speak informally... no, feel free to do as you please.\"You'll talk down when you get used to it. That is not what is important now.Chung-Myung grabbed his head looking at the paper that had not dried up.\"So that's all the martial arts in the Scary Hall right now?\"Jo-Gol nodded silently.\"Oh, I'm going crazy.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung hung down on the chair. Jo-Gol couldn't even guess why he was like this, as always.What the hell is wrong with her?'Suddenly, he asked me to write down all the titles of the secretaries at the Scary Hall, and when I saw the list, I was sniffing.\"That's it?\"Then repeat the same thing like a parrot.'No matter how you look at it, you're out of your mind.'That's what private education did. You have to throw away a lot of things to be strong.But isn't this guy throwing away too much? I think we need to maintain the minimum of humanity...\u2026.\"Death penalty.\"\"Huh?\"\"Anything but this? Isn't there a limit to where capital punishment can go?\"\"I'm not allowed to read, but it's okay. That's all.\"\"\u2026\u2026no.\"Chung-Myung's gaze goes through the list again.When I was told that I was going to learn the art of Taeulmijae, I guessed the situation to a certain extent. But this is too much, too much.\"No, what placenta is flying away?\"We'll pick out important swordsmanship.Who can do this without deliberately trying to spoil Hawasan?\"So now the great disciples are learning Taeul-mi sword and Bok-ho Cheongyang sword?\"\"That's what I know.\"\"\u2026\u2026I'm so sorry.\"Chung-Myung is scratching his head.This is more serious than I thought.'This is not enough.Of course, it is true that people are more important than Muhak. But isn't there a degree to that? The enemy comes running with a well-defined sword, and if you ask them to fight by holding a branch on this side, they will be slapped even before handing it over.At least it should be done. At least.However, the Taeil Miri and Bokho Cheongyang swords were below the minimum.'I wish I had the Seven Swords.'Hwasan wouldn't be like this. The more I think about it, the more I get angry.Chung-Myung struggled to calm down the simmering stomach, and suddenly Jo-Gol opened his mouth.\"From what I hear...\u2026.\"\"Huh?\"I didn't even ask, but I'm getting something.\"When the old Magician invaded, the library caught fire.\"\"\u2026\u2026Is the library on fire? Oh, more than that, the Magician invaded?\"Why did the Magyo invade Hwasan? Wasn't Heavenly Demon dead and shattered?Jo-Gol asked another question before answering.\"Do you know plum screening?\"\"I know.\"I know very well. Because no one knows me better than me. I know very well.\"Housekeepers say the plum inspection helped kill Heavenly Demon.\"\"\u2026\u2026do you help?\"I cut his throat. What? You're helping?Chung-Myung\uc758 \uc5bc\uad74\uc774 \uc0b4\uc9dd \ub2ec\uc544\uc62c\ub790\ub2e4. \ubaa9\uc228\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubc84\ub9ac\uba74\uc11c \uc774\ub904 \ub0b8 \uc5c5\uc801\uc744 \uc774\ub7f0 \uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c4\ud558\ud558\ub2e4\ub2c8!\"\uadf8\ub7f0\ub370 \ubb50. \ubaa8\ub97c \uc77c\uc774\uc9c0.\"\"\ubb58 \ubab0\ub77c, \uc778\ub9c8! \ub9e4\ud654\uac80\uc874\uc774 Heavenly Demon \ubaa9\uc744 \ubcb4\ub294\ub370!\"\"Huh? Who said that?\"\"Who said that? It's all... ...\"What?Chung-Myung's head slightly turned sideways.Now, hold on.'\"I can't say for sure that no, because all the people who climbed the mountain died. So no one knows how Heavenly Demon died.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yeah, they're all dead. Since Chung-Myung survived and cut off Heavenly Demon's throat.So no one has seen it...\u2026, right, no one has seen it.Yes, indeed.Chung-Myung realized.'No, then...\u2026.'You've knocked down Heavenly Demon, giving up your life for the honor of Hawasan, which means no one recognizes?What kind of dog is this?\"Anyway, that's when Heavenly Demon collapsed in Daesan, and the remaining remnants of the Magical Church went crazy and pushed them down the middle ground. Even though he suffered a lot of damage, he came all the way up to Wasan and started a fire.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"A cold sweat began to flow from Chung-Myung's predecessor.But Jo-Gol, who did not notice such a change in Chung-Myung, nonchalantly continued.\"He said he didn't know why. I don't think there's a particular grudge in Wasan.\"\"Uh... well, it's...\u2026.\"You don't know why. I think I know.\"Huh.\"So, if you put this together.The fact that Hwasan was smashed.\"Is it because of me?'Yes?Because of me?\"Hahaha.\"\"Why are you laughing all of a sudden?\"\"Hahahaha.\"Oh, my life.Hahaha.

However, some of the people who protected Daesan must have survived. Mt. 100,000 is their home.So it is no wonder that there was someone who saw Chung-Myung slit the throat of Heavenly Demon.\"Oh, my God!\"Chung-Myung threw the paper he held in his hand.All the people who should be recognized were dead, so I couldn't see a single one, and I saw someone who shouldn't. What kind of dog is this?Jo-Gol backed down in a pinch.\"Why are you suddenly angry...\u2026.\"\"Turn it off.\"Chung-Myung rubbed his face.Take it easy.It's not something to get angry about Jo-Gol in front of you. You can always get angry later.\"So the Magicians stormed in and wiped out the Hawasan?\"\"I don't think the damage was enormous. They've spent a lot of energy coming through the Sichuan stream to the island. But I heard that the hall was burned quite a lot. I heard that martial arts were lost a lot.\"Of course, I understand.Even if it was not properly transmitted, it would not have looked like this if it had only been in a state of emergency. Even if it's hellish to learn martial arts without a teacher, it's a hundred times better than nothing.If even that rank is lost, it explains why Hawasan collapsed so quickly.\"I can explain...\u2026.\"Why do you mean it's not cool and it's frustrating when it's clearly explained?\"Okay, I got it.\"Chung-Myung rose from a non-chuck position.\"Where are you?\"\"\u2026\u2026walk\u2014I need to clear my head for a while.\"\"He'll be here soon to check on you. I don't know if I get in trouble.\"\"Yes, yes, thank you.\"Jo-Gol shook his head as if he didn't understand, looking at Chung-Myung, who was leaving the seat with a squeamish voice.'He's a weirdo anyway.'* * *\"Crazy.\"There's a thousand dollars in my stomach.Come on, freeze to death!You risked your life, or literally took your life, and you cut off Heavenly Demon's head, and the rest of them ate it up and Hawasan went down?What the hell are all these bullshit results? There is no justice in this world!The more I thought about it, the more I felt inside out.\"Huh....\"Now it's hard to get angry at these pathetic people. It's all because of Chung-Myung. What would you say?\"No, what kind of loyalty are you, Mein?\"If Heavenly Demon is dead, he'll be crushed in a corner and live a decent life. He's coming to the island to avenge it.Had Hawasan been attached to the Sichuan area, not to the island, the pillar roots would have been pulled out and left.\"I can't say it's a good thing.\"Only the innocent hair was pulled out.\"Sigh.\"Still, sitting alone on the eaves and looking at the sky where darkness begins to fall, I feel a little relieved.'That's the way it is.'Chung-Myung is really annoyed not because what he did was detrimental to Hasan. The reason he was angry was that all of his future people had to pay for what he had done.If Chung-Myung had to live and deal with the aftermath of the work, he would have endured it sweetly.But he died, and didn't the little disciples, who knew nothing, take the heat? Now it was hard to calm down thinking that Hawasan's look was the price.\"Well, what can I do?\"No one could blame Chung-Myung.Although Hawasan was in a bad shape because he killed Heavenly Demon, if he didn't kill Heavenly Demon then the entire midfield would have collapsed as well as Hawasan.Chung-Myung had no choice. Chung-Myung will cut Heavenly Demon's throat without hesitation, even if he goes back to that time now.But...\"Strangely uncomfortable.\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply.\"Well, what's in the past is inevitably happened. If it's broken, you can stop it for me!\"It doesn't matter if he's responsible. Responsible or not, isn't what he has to do the same anyway? All you have to do is revive Hawasan.\"It doesn't make a difference. As long as the results are good!\"It's enough to bring it back stronger than it was before it failed. It may not be possible for others, but it is possible for Chung-Myung.It's a bit difficult.No, it's very difficult.It may be more difficult in terms of difficulty than cutting off Heavenly Demon's throat, but isn't it important to be able to do it?I'm in a hurry.'For those who train, impatience is poison. It is a different matter to move on quickly and to move fast. You have to be more self-reliant and not in a hurry up.\"Come on, make yourself at home.\"Let's find out what's broken apart from the fear that's lost. To do that, it's best to ask someone.\"Where's the long man? Get out of here now!\"Okay. First of all, to a long writer...\u2026.No, this isn't what I said.Chung-Myung opened his eyes wide and turned to where the sound came from.The main gate?I could hear a babble at the far-sighted front door.\"At this hour?\"The sun was setting. But visitors at this hour?No, what did he say before that?\"Come out, the long man!\"Oh, I did. Long...\u2026.\"A long man?\"Chung-Myung poked his ear with a blank face.\"What did I just hear?\"Do you have a long story?\"No, which one of the crazies?'Who dares to barge in at the front door of Hawasan and call out a long man with such insolence? It's inconceivable if it's former Hawaiian.His fist would've stuck in his mouth before he could even bring up that frivolous word.But now the guys at the door don't seem to be aware of what they're doing.Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!There's a violent knock on the door. At the same time, the door, which had barely maintained its shape, began to rattle as if it were breaking.\"Hey, hey, hey, hey?\"Cooooong!The front door finally falls back with a loud noise. The door that fell to the floor shattered, smoking dirt everywhere.Chung-Myung looked at the scene with a blank face.\"Break the door?\"The front gate of Hawasan?What the hell is going on?\"Let's go in!\"About a dozen people who broke the door rush inside. Then, he runs straight to the residence of the long-winded man. It didn't seem like a consistent movement had ever been done once or twice.The tumult of the boat frightened out.\"Now, hold on!\"\"You can't do this!\"But his opponent was relentless.\"Get out of the way, will you?\"\"Tell the long man to come out!\"\"Huh, did you just touch your body?\"Chung-Myung's eyes rolled over.What's going on right now?'I can't feel any sense of merit from those who broke through the door.But the boats were struggling as if it was hard to dare stop them. Even every time a big man tapped out his stomach, the boats were pushed as if they had been shot.It's not that I'm pushed back because I don't have the strength.Never! I felt determined not to bump into them no matter what.\"He\u2026\u2026.\"Before Chung-Myung could even grasp the situation, those who stormed pushed the Unja ship and reached the front of the long-written man's residence.\"Long-time man, come out now!\"\"Don't run away and come out!\"\"I know you're in there! I'll never just go back today, so come out right away.\"Chung-Myung felt his head getting dizzy.\"Is what I'm looking at real life?'Where is this place?No matter how bad it is, it's one of the Hawasanites! But the Hawasanites, they're making such a fuss in front of a long-time writer's house.\"Oops!\"Blood spurted up on my forehead. But Chung-Myung can't get rid of his seething anger.\"What is he doing?\"\"Huh?\"One of the Unja boats that dissuaded them turned his head violently and looked up at Chung-Myung.\"Get in there now! Why are the three great disciples wandering around this place at this hour?\"\"\u2026\u2026uh.\"Chung-Myung turned his head from side to side.Come to think of it, no one comes outside except him. Even though there are many people who have heard it since this much fuss broke out.\"Did this happen more often than I thought?'If there is a disturbance, it is human nature to stick out your head. Nevertheless, the fact that no one is coming out as planned means that there is already a code of conduct for how to deal with such a situation.There's no way that Chung-Myung, who just joined us.\"What are you doing?\"But even so, I'm not the one who's gonna do anything about them, you bastards!\"Long-time man, come out now!\"\"I'm never going to leave like this today! It's no use hiding out there. Get out of here!\"\"You don't know the numbers!\"Regardless of whether the Unja ship persecuted Chung-Myung or not, those who flocked to the front of the residence screamed and did not stop waiting.Chung-Myung's neck is stiffening.It was that moment.Squeak.The door opens with a slightly harsh noise. And Hyun Jong, a long writer of Hawaiian, walked out slowly.When he came out, the boats that dissuaded the crowd paid tribute in unison. The long writer shook his hand slightly, bit them, and opened his mouth.\"Are these late hours of your life?\"Let's see.Chung-Myung was amazed even though blood was rushing to his head.Even if it's Hu, he's also lived many years. A low distribution and a late birth date do not mean a person's dignity is diminished.Each movement and tone seems to flow out of the air. Thanks to this, Chung-Myung also feels a little less excited.It's...\"What are you talking about when you know it!\"\"Come down for now! Now!\"\"Why are you pretending to be so relaxed?\"Yes, you're pretending to be relaxed...\u2026.Oh, no, this isn't it!Hyun Jong comes down with his face slightly hardened. Then he sighed low.\"I don't run away, I don't hide. Where do you mean I'm going if I leave Hawaii? So let's all calm down...\u2026.\"\"Calm down your anger!\"Chung-Myung's eyes popped out.Even though Hyun Jong was saying something with good spirit, those crazy people were not even listening.The weird thing is, though, that Hyun Jong can't say anything and is flustered.What did you do wrong? It's like....'Huh?'A word came to Chung-Myung's mind.\"Long man!\"A person who seemed to be the representative of the party pointed a finger and shouted.\"We've waited long enough! I can't wait any longer!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Sun-gi disappears from Hyun Jong's face.'Well, that's....'Are you sure?\"When are you going to pay me back? It's long overdue! We can't stand it anymore!\"Chung-Myung looked at Hyun Jong with blank eyes.Hyun Jong, who has changed from a good-natured doin to a debtor, opens his mouth in a vague manner.\"Shi, if you give me a little more time...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung grabbed the back of his neck and leaned his head back.'Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.'Are you in debt?All you have left is a collapsing warlord, and you owe it to Munpa?'Really.'Tears formed around Chung-Myung's eyes. The sky became cloudy.'You've got to have it's got to be. You crazy people.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he stepped forward, others shut their mouths at once and stepped back from side to side.Is he the boss?'Chung-Myung glowed at the person who came forward.It is a typical merchant's appearance. A slightly chubby face and clothes decorated with expensive silk.'You look rich.'The person who came forward opened his mouth. Chung-Myung still listened.\"Have you been at peace?\"\"I didn't expect the princess to come in person.\"A man called Gongruju smiled softly.\"I don't feel good to see a man of letters again for this matter. Please understand that this person tried not to climb Hawasan again if he could, but there were so many people rushing him that he couldn't do anything about it.\"\"I'm sorry.\"Hyun Jong lowered his head lightly.Then the princess opened her mouth with a slightly different voice than before.\"One long man. You have to understand other people's feelings. The contract date has already passed a long time.\"\"Hmm.\"The princess reclines her shoulders slightly. In Chung-Myung's eyes, the gesture couldn't seem so arrogant.\"We've already let him off the hook several times. Nevertheless, if you keep breaking your promise like this, I can't let you off the hook any longer.\"Hyun Jong couldn't say anything.On the surface, it was a peaceful face, but Chung-Myung's eyes showed Hyun Jong's face wriggling subtly.Of course it will.As a long-time writer of Hawasan, none of the long-term writers have ever experienced the experience of suffering from debtors in front of civil servants.\"If it's up to the contract, I'll have to get paid for breaking the contract right now.\"The princess shook her head with a smile.\"We have also lived under the grace of Hawasan. I don't want to be so harsh.\"\"Princess!\"\"We've already...\u2026.\"\"Huh.\"Other merchants around him protested, but when the princess opened her mouth, she shut up as if she had planned. Then I sneak up on him.\"If you don't know grace, you're nothing more than an animal. Don't just think of the grace you've given. Anyone who lives in harmony grew up with the grace of Hawasan. Don't forget the work of your predecessor.\"\"Hmm.\"\"That's right.\"Gong Lu-ju smiles broadly and opens her mouth to see if everyone understood.\"So I'd like to give you a little more consideration. I'll give you seven days and seven nights from now on. If you don't pay back the money you borrowed for seven weeks and nights, I'll take the price as per the initial contract.\"\"Go, princess, wait a minute...\u2026.\"\"The Long Man.\"The princess shakes her head still.\"No more. My body that moves money. This alone is as convenient as possible. If the payment is not ready when I return seven weeks and seven nights later, I will confiscate all of Hawasan's cabinet as promised.\"\"Gasp!\"The princess turned her head to the sound that popped out of nowhere. Chung-Myung, who is covering his mouth in his sight, comes in.\"You looked ugly in front of the child.\"The princess reaches out her hand and wins the lottery.\"That's all for today. Jang Moon-in. I hope we can see each other smiling next time. Of course.\"As the princess turned around, the merchants who had followed her turned around together. Nevertheless, he did not forget to turn his head and stare at Hyun Jong.Hyun Jong raises his head and opens his mouth as he sees them exit the prose with a dignified air.\"\u2026\u2026Huh.\"It's a bit empty and a bit tired.So it was a sigh that sounded heavier.* * *\"So.\"Chung-Myung was resting his chin, with his legs crossed.\"A merchant of harmony?\"\"I'm telling you.\"\"Turn it off.\"Chung-Myung's head is rattling back and forth. Do In-myeong slipped back when he saw it.I don't know what else he's gonna do. I'm going to avoid it.The reason why he is explaining this in front of Chung-Myung is very simple.Returning to the White House with great momentum, he called in all the children of the mall and selected those who knew the condition of Hawasan. And finally, it is Do In-myeong who meets his standards.Thanks to this, Do In-myeong explains to Chung-Myung what he knows and doesn't know.\"Isn't harmony the name of the town under Hawasan?\"Jo-Gol, who was listening to Do In-myung together, asked.\"Yes, death penalty. I remember seeing it before when I was peddling with my father.\"\"So Hawasan borrowed money from merchants in Chords?\"\"I don't think that's...\u2026.\"Do In-myung scratched his head.Although it was Hwasan's job, the three great disciples couldn't have known it. At best, I can only guess from what is going on.\"The Gongluju is the Luju of Taehwaru, Chords. It's the biggest base in harmony, and I heard that you're working on various businesses based on it. He's the master of harmony.\"\"Hmm.\"\"So if Hawasan had borrowed money, I would have borrowed it from him\u2026\u2026.\"It'suddenly.\"Huh?\"Jo-Gol turned his head away. And then soon my face turned white.Chung-Myung's neck was rattling like a broken wooden doll.\"Father, wake up, priest!\"\"Tae, Taehwa-ru...\u2026.\"\"What's wrong?\"Jo-Gol freaked out when he saw Chung-Myung, who was mesmerized by shock.Of course they won't understand what's wrong with Chung-Myung.Wake up.Chung-Myung, who suddenly jumped up from his seat as if he had returned to life, stared at Do In-myeong with scary eyes.\"Gasp?\"Then, at lightning speed, he rushed to the doer and grabbed him by the collar.\"Is it true that he was the rouge of Taehwaru?\"\"Well, I'm telling you.\"\"The rouge of Taehwaru lends money to Hawasan and tries to confiscate his cabinet?\"\"Gee, calm down, priest!\"\"Calm down? You want me to calm down now?\"Hey, you bastards! Do I look like I'm gonna calm down?Chung-Myung untied Do In-myung's hand by the collar, scraping his head wildly and tearing it apart.\"What's wrong with you, priest?\"Chung-Myung couldn't answer the question at all. The reason is simple.Because I can't explain it.Because!\"Taehwa-ru is Hwasan's!\" Crazy!'Just because you're a master doesn't mean you live on grass. Small and medium-sized literary groups may not know how long they will continue with the money they receive from local visitors, but it is impossible to maintain large literary groups such as Hawasan alone.In the first place, those who are prosecutors or moussa are only interested in being strong by themselves, because they are not a penny to Moonpa's housekeeping.It will take a lot of money to feed such insectivores as a group. Because of that, Hawasan had several operations in Chords. One of the sites is Taehwa Roo.But the owner of the taehwa lends money to hwasan in reverse and forfeits hwasan's cabinet with the debt?It doesn't add up.Yeah...... if it doesn't add up, it means something's wrong!\"\u2026\u2026Jo-Gol's death penalty.\"\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung beckons in silence. Jo-Gol approached Chung-Myung with curious eyes. When Chung-Myung whispered something only Jo-Gol could hear, Jo-Gol opened his eyes wide and looked at him.\"That?\"\"Can you get it?\"Jo-Gol stumbles a little.\"Oh, no. I can get it, but...\u2026.\"\"Then get it.\"\"\u2026\u2026Really?\"\"Do I look like I'm joking? Capital punishment?\"\"Go, I'll get it.\"Jo-Gol exits the room with a slightly nervous face.What are you trying to do?'Yoon-jong tilted his head while watching the scene. Jo-Gol's reaction is extraordinary.But you didn't have to worry so deeply. Because Jo-Gol came back with something even before the strain was over.He gives Chung-Myung what he has in his hand with a subtle face.\"Cheon?\"No, is it clothing? But why would you do that out of the blue in this situation?Chung-Myung, who took the clothes that Jo-Gol had handed out, flung off the application he was wearing without hesitation.\"Oh?\"Then he quickly began to wear the clothes Jo-Gol brought.Black clothing that sticks to your body...\u2026.\"What, what are you going to do?\"\"I'll ask.\"\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung replies nonchalantly.\"If you ask your private servants, they won't answer you properly, and they'll tell you to stay out of it.\"Of course, dude! Because that's the right thing to say!\"So I'm asking you myself!\"\"Now, hold on!\"A cold sweat began to run down Yoon-jong's forehead.So far, what Chung-Myung has done has happened in Hawasan. Therefore, there was a lot of room for trouble, but somehow it was possible to fix it. But what's about to happen isn't just Hwasan's job.You have to stop him.'If you're lucky, you might end up getting information moderately, but...\u2026.That can't be true!'Chung-Myung is, so to speak, a man with no backing up. I can tell from what I've seen so far. He'll definitely cause trouble! You can hang your neck.And if this guy goes down the mountain and causes an accident, the aftermath will be uncontrollable.If you can't stop it here, it's Yoon-jong's responsibility. If the adults of Munpa find out what caused the accident, the ambassador, Yoon-jong, will not be safe.But how do I stop him?If I could stop you with a few words, I would have done it already.Yoon-jong opened his mouth in a cold sweat.\"What are you, what are you going to do?\"\"I'm asking you in person.\"\"What if I don't answer?\"\"You don't answer?\"Chung-Myung tilts his head.\"That's not usually the case. They're telling me to stop because they're gonna answer.\"What do you mean, stop it, you freak!Yoon-jong racked his brains with all his might.\"You're a master, aren't you?\"\"Huh?\"\"Yeah, you're a do-in. You're a student of Hwasan!\"I don't know why, but Chung-Myung seemed to be proud of his pursuit of Do and being a disciple of Hwasan. So what if you stimulate that part well?\"You can't do such a thing! That's why it's no different than the Black Island Bangs!\"Then Chung-Myung nodded deeply.\"That's absolutely true. Doin shouldn't do such a thing.\"Surely this one move seemed to work. Yoon-jong's face lit up with a ray of hope.\"Oh, yeah!\"\"But the death penalty! Listen to me!\"\"Huh?\"\"There's a saying! Don't worry about it. Kill the ministry when you meet the ministry, kill the investigation when you meet the investigation!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I know!

The peddlers visited the chords in a row without knowing the end, and those who wanted to see the wasasan continued to walk.Thanks to this, those who live in harmony did not have to worry about making ends meet just by the name of Hwasan.But when the moon is full, it tilts.Harmony began to lose its vitality as Hawasan lost its reputation.Taehwa Roo was the main base that still represents harmony. And there were now a dozen merchants on the top floor.\"Hahahaha.\"A big laugh burst out.\"The man seemed very embarrassed. Did you see that face?\"\"It's understandable. Anyway, this side has issued an ultimatum.\"\"It's too much to do! A hundred thousand gold coins they took! With that money, you can buy a few bases! I helped because of my predecessor's relationship, but if you have a conscience, you should have already paid it back.\"\"Of course, of course. That's human nature.\"Rouge of Taehwaru. Gong Munyeon nodded still. Then a person put on a nice face.\"I'm a merchant chasing Lee, but I'm not so comfortable because I feel like I've dealt too much with the place where the relationship has been connected from my generation.\"\"What do you mean, princess! You have done as much as you can. Didn't you give them the benefit of the doubt even though they broke the reimbursement date several times in the first place?\"\"Yes, that's enough for no one to blame the princess. Why not praise the princess for her mercy?\"\"I'm glad to hear that.\"The princess saved her breath and drank. But inside, he laughed at those who sat in front of him.\"That's comfortable.\"I can't believe I can live with such a simple mind.'Hwasan's potential is formidable.'Hawasan's real power does not come from force. The most vigilant thing in Hawaii is the history they have built up.After hundreds of years of such a cult, there are people who build relationships whether they like it or not. It is more difficult to find people who have no relationship with Hwasan, at least within the island.You never know when you're around.Hawasan's presence is now spotless, so there will be more people who don't care much if it disappears.But the important thing is next.As soon as you get the hang of it, there will be more and more people looking for a \"reason. If they don't show their cause properly, harmony can be smashed in an instant.Most of the people who are connected to wasan have status and status, not the ones who go out of the field.'But I'm sure it's okay.'I muted slowly enough not to get indigestion even if I eat.If it has been boiled for this long, it should be said that it has become as soft as a duck whose flesh is torn by just using chopsticks.\"But my princess.\"\"Yes.\"\"What are you going to do by taking away the office of Hawasan?\"\"Well.\"The princess smiled lightly.\"The cabinet is more meaningful than you might think. It may seem like an old cabinet, but it's a good deal.\"\"I don't quite understand.\"You foolsThe look almost changed slightly, but the princess succeeded in stopping the face from being distorted.\"The power of the name Hawasan still remains. If you use it as a moderate tourist destination, many people will visit Hawaii.\"\"One\u2026\u2026.\"Yujong San, who sells silk in harmony, looked sick.\"How much would it cost for a man to hear about that rough Hawaiian. Would you rather get something else than a cabinet?\"\"I don't deserve it.\"\"Hmm.\"The princess rolled up her lips.\"There's nothing to worry about. I don't want to say it out loud, but there's a place where you can buy a lot of money even if it's nothing.\"\"You mean there is a place like that? That's how much I love was there...\u2026.\"\"The opposite, isn't it?\"\"Oh....\"Yujong San nodded as if he understood.A literary group who wants to erase the existence of Hwasan even by buying the remaining cabinet at the expense of extra money. There are only a couple of places that come to mind.\"So don't worry about that. I will definitely collect your money.\"\"Hahaha, what do you mean worry? We always believe in the princess.\"\"Of course! The merchants of harmony, of course, should trust and follow the princess.\"Gong Luju, or Gong Munyeon, nodded with a smile on his face.But inside, it was completely different.'You can't go for these things and the big deal.'Harmony is a dying land.It was a worthy enough place when Hawasan rose to fame, but now there is nothing left in the chords. Thanks to the siphoning off of Hwasan from his predecessor, he now has only a shell left.And it was strangling the chords.In the first place, harmony is not the main point and it is not crowded. Nevertheless, the only reason why harmony became famous and developed was because there was Hawasan here.The chords can't be maintained if Hawasan disappears completely.'You have to clean up and leave before it's too late.'If you can sell Hawasan's cabinet and get your hands on a huge sum of money, it's no wonder you're reborn as a merchant. First of all, to do that...\u2026.\"Hmm?\"At that moment, Gong Munyeon turned his head away.\"Who is it!\"As soon as he shouted, the guards who were guarding the base run out of the base.\"Who's there? Who's there?\"\"Who's here?\"Gong Munyeon said nothing, and waited for the guards to return.It was not long before the guards opened the window and returned.\"No one was there.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"When Gong Munyeon didn't answer immediately, Yujong San smiled and said.\"Gongruju, isn't this the top floor of Taehwaru? Do you mean someone is coming here?\"\"Yes, and if they were, they would have found it. It doesn't even have wings. How could you hide here?\"Gong Munyeon nodded.\"Was he nervous?\"No wonder. It's not long before his long-cherished wish comes true.\"I guess I was tired. I want to enjoy it more, but I think it's right to end it here today.\"Everyone stood up, accepting what he said. Gong Munyeon gave them a rather tired-looking smile.But the nerves that had once bristled did not subside.I think I need to rest a little.* * *\"Hmm!\"Yujong San stumbled along the street.\"That's great!\"The alcohol seems to have gone in a little too far. The excitement hasn't stopped for a while.Why wouldn't that be the case?'That's a lot of money.'The money we get from Hawasan is a hell of a lot. Since a long time ago, interest has piled up on interest, and the amount of money that was lent for the first time has grown to just a speck.If you can recover that money, it's nothing to play for the rest of your life.The princess is an unreliable man, but she is as accurate as she is about money. Doesn't Yujong San just get paid for whatever he's up to?\"The moon is bright...\" What? There's no moon? Come on. That's it.\"Yujong San smiled and looked around. It's creepy, it looks just right to be mugged. On a day like this, you should go to a boulevard, not a corner like this, but you came to a place like this in the spirit of alcohol.My my.I was short-minded. If a robber with a knife appears in front of you at a moment like this...\u2026.\"Hang on.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yujong San closed and opened his eyes.Someone was blocking the dark alley. Black night happiness and black mask. It's...It's like a drawing of a robber.'He was small for a robber, so he didn't feel a lot of pressure, but he felt a clear doctor in that outfit.No, but do they usually rob in that outfit? Robbery is something you have to do in secret if you can, and that's obvious.I'm a robber!'Isn't that what you're wearing?Yujong San opened his mouth with a grin.\"Is this some kind of robbery?\"\"I don't care about money.\"The nocturnal man stepped forward.\"As long as you answer what you ask, I'll let you go.\"\"Whoa?\"Yujong San smirked.\"It's not that I don't want to give you an answer, but I'm in a bit of trouble.Yes.\"The nocturnal raised his head slightly at his words.\"There's a lot of family with it. It's not easy to walk around alone.\"Let's go.Several groups appeared around Yujong San with a small pasong sound. Soldiers wearing swords. I think he was a guard at the top.\"I'd like to answer, but I don't think they'd be happy to hear me answer. Unfortunately.\"The nocturnal man looked at Yujong San without answering.Yujong San, who was out of excitement, drooled and closed his mouth. Instead, the guards open their mouths.\"What do I do, kill?\"\"Hmmm.\"Yujong San stroked his beard.\"Didn't you mean that you came to me for a purpose, not just to grab anyone and rob them?\"\"\"I think so.\"\"Then you must hear the purpose. Get him, so he can talk.\"\"Yes!\"It was the moment when the guards were about to rush forward.\"Wait a minute.The nocturnal man raises his hand to stop them.\"Huh?\"\"I don't want to cause any trouble if I can. Once again, just answer the question and you'll have a good ending. I mean\u2026\u2026.\"\"How long are you going to listen to this crap? Bring it in!\"\"Yes!\"The guards surrounded the nocturnal with a protective force.You idiot.Yujong San turned his head when he saw it. He doesn't really like violent scenes.Those are the ones who paid a fortune to sign a contract. They're not the ones who're supposed to do this. Therefore, there was an aspect of hands that was more excessive than general escorts. So this time again, in an instant...\u2026.Boom!That's right.Whoops!Oh, my. That's too much.Whoops!Yujong San frowned. It was too much for the hand.\"Didn't I tell you to let me speak?\"\"Oh, really?\"\"Yes, I am...\u2026.Huh?\"Who just answered that?Yujong San looked up and looked forward.\"\u2026\u2026.\"He sees the guards falling down with foam in his eyes. And the nocturnal man who must have smashed the guards with a single blow was approaching him with his head down.\"People need to understand what they say. Strangely, he doesn't understand what I'm saying.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The nocturnal man nods his finger.\"Come here, come here.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yujong San approached the nocturnal person as if possessed.\"Once again, if you answer well, nothing will happen. Do you understand?\"\"Yes!\"The answer came out on the dot.\"Come on, then.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes?\"What?\"If I had answered at first, I would have just asked, but I tried to fight, so I should have been beaten.\"\"Yes?\"\"Don't worry.

Why bother people like this when it's crazy to hit people like a dog out of course.\"Hey.\"\"Yes!\"\"I don't think I'd be able to sell it to you right now, let alone a hundred thousand, but you lent me a hundred thousand to Hawasan?\"\"Oh, it's....\"Yujong San, who clearly figured out what Chung-Myung was using as a problem, replied with a big smile.\"That's what rings are all about. If you lend money with a high interest rate, the interest will continue to increase unless you pay back the principal. Hehe. As it rises and rises, the interest becomes so huge that the principal is nothing. If you swallow it then...\u2026.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"Oops!\"Yujong San grabbed his head and rolled on the floor.\"Showing off, man.\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply.Well, is there no point in blaming him?'Perhaps Hawasan's debt was not built up in his day.I'm sure he is.'It's meaningless to borrow a lot of money now. The time when real money was needed was when Hawasan collapsed. Because I need money to get a basket to plug in the sand.\"By the way.\"\"Yes.\"\"Did you say you were the shopkeeper of the Chordship Point?\"\"That's right.\"\"When did you buy the Chordship Point?\"\"Huh? What do you mean? That store has been owned by my family for generations.\"\"...was the owner?\"\"Yes, as far as I know, my great-grandfather built a harmony store.\"Chung-Myung grinned.'No way.'The same is true: Chordship Artillery was one of the businesses of Hawasan.Hmm?Was all the best businesses in Chords owned by Hwasan?Of course.It's no wonder. In the first place, harmony was just a village with a few fields until Hawasan settled down.With the arrival of Hwasan and the increase of visitors, the village was created, and it developed into a large prefecture as Hwasan released money to create various businesses.The business of touching some money in chords is basically Hwasan's.So, what, the harmony store was going to start with your great-grandfather?Considering his age, his great-grandfather would have been around Chung-Myung's age or younger. I remember going to the Harmony Point to get rid of the children's uniforms, but the owner froze to death.'It smells bad.'Let me see.\"I need a few answers.\"\"\u2026\u2026 Feel free to ask.\"\"Then who runs Hwaseondaru?\"\"It's a cruise.\"\"Of course it belonged to your family a few generations ago, didn't it?\"\"That's what I know.\"\"Of course the top five and the chords do, right?\"\"Yes, they're all very good at harmony.\"Chung-Myung grinned. I know roughly even if you don't ask me any more.So the guys who ran the business while Hawasan's boss was cut off and ruined all of it?\"Oh, my.\"I tried to hold it in, but I kept smiling.There are two reasons why Hawasan does not run businesses directly and entrust them to agents.The first is that Hawasan, no matter how much he is a secular sect, is ultimately a province. It is impossible to look good for others to run a base and sell silk at a common store.And the other thing is.- Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161. What Hwasan wants is not to monopolize wealth, but to live well together. Aren't the people in harmony neighbors, if not belonging to Hawasan? If we live well together and we are full together, what could be better?Good things freeze to death.'This is a person. Long death penalty.'There is only one reason why scriptures and good people emphasize that people should be able to return their kindness.Because man is a being who does not repay his kindness.No, I'm glad you didn't pay me back. A person can put a knife on his benefactor's back at any time if he or she benefits.At best, I gave him grace so that he could make ends meet, but instead of repaying it, he took advantage of the crisis and carried the business.Then I'll know my sins and live with a silver spoon. Put a hook in Hasan based on the business?\"Era!\"Boom!Chung-Myung kicks Yujong San with all his might, and Yujong San's huge body rolls like a ball.\"Oh, my God!\"Chung-Myung sighed as he looked at it.What's the point of hitting him?'Maybe Yujong San doesn't even know what's wrong with what he's doing. Because he thinks the harmony target is really his family's business.How am I supposed to do this?'Chung-Myung couldn't help but be troubled.I want to hit these guys right away, kick them out of harmony, and gulp down businesses again, but this is not so simple.Hawasan is a prestigious political party.Now that the name of prestigious has faded, however, the image of Hwasan, who Chung-Myung wants to revive, does not deviate much from the prestigious political faction.What if it's a safa? Those who are called the prestigious political faction threaten other businesses with power without justifiable reasons?On that day, Hawasan's name falls to the ground.\"It's twisted, but it's dirty.\"I know exactly how things went, but the solution is difficult. We must find a way to regain business without threatening it with power and without losing its cause.It's easy to say!\"Turn it off.\"Chung-Myung, who scratched the back of his head, glanced around Yujong San.\"Hey, so...\u2026.\"It was then.\"Stop!\"\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung turned his head to the voice from behind.\"Huh? Are you awake?\"One of Yujong San's escorts, which had just been blown away, came to his senses and aimed at him.I thought I hit it pretty hard, but I've already regained consciousness, it seems stronger than Chung-Myung thought.\"You son of a b*tc*!\"The escort gritted his teeth.\"Cowardly attack!\"Surprise?Did I?Chung-Myung looked at the escort with an absurd face.\"Hey, you came at me first.\"\"You coward!\"\"Oh, yeah, well, let's just go with it.\"I don't want to pick a fight with him. Let's just say yes.\"Who is it?\"\"Huh?\"\"I don't think he's a minor in obscurity, but identify yourself.\"The absurdity has grown a little more.You think I'd wear a mask if I knew who I was?\"What are you going to do with yourself?\"\"I need to know who died on my sword.\"\"\u2026\u2026you just fainted after being hit by me.\"Then you'll have to pretend you're dead even though you're unconscious. Why do you stand up and earn a beating? Did all the kids get stupid during my reincarnation?\"If I hadn't let my guard down, I wouldn't be beaten by such a thing as you. I've been escorted for a while, and now I'm humiliated. Do you know who I am?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"This adult god is the Trench Island Jeongbin. Even if you don't have any knowledge, you've heard the name of this body, right?\"\"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not as knowledgeable as you think.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Trench also opened Jung Bin's eyes wide.His name is widespread in the island's western provinces, although he is now on a short guard duty to make money. And you've never heard of this name?\"You cheeky bastard.\"Jeongbin grabs Do and aims at Chung-Myung.\"I'll give you a chance to say that name before you die.\"\"Ha...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply.Why are there so many crazy people in the world?\"Hey, but I don't think that's what the escort would say. I'm closer to the person you're supposed to escort?\"\"Now I'm good at escorts.\"Oh, yes. I'm sorry.You were a hot person.\"Be prepared!\"Trench also rushed toward Chung-Myung wielding a do. Chung-Myung clicked his tongue at the sight.His history is clearly stronger than Chung-Myung. And neither strength nor speed is Chung-Myung comparable. By general standards, Jung Bin is so strong that even comparing himself to Chung-Myung is rude.Is Chung-Myung weaker than Jeongbin?You welcome!Strength, strength, speed.Such is not a measure of strength. It may be a measure for ordinary people, but it does not apply to Chung-Myung.Doesn't he have the experience of swinging a sword all his life and the memory of plum blossom inspection?\"Oops.\"Chung-Myung's sword swings slowly. Compared to Jeong Bin's strong performance, it seems that it is hard to catch even a fly.Snap!However, the powerless sword clings to Jeongbin's strong flying province.\"Huh?\"At that moment, Jung Bin opened his eyes wide.As soon as Chung-Myung's slow sword sticks to the drawing of the province, a huge weightlifting is suddenly delivered through his arm.\"Argh!\"Jeong Bin's spirit soared into the sky as his grip burst out.\"Learn more.\"Chung-Myung's sword embroidered the sky brilliantly. It's not a vivid plum blossom, but a blurry flower blooms in Ho Gong.Flop.Jeongbin's body collapsed to the floor like a rotten tree.\"Tsk.\"Chung-Myung kicked his tongue and retrieved the sword.If I don't have power, I can use the power of the enemy.A kid who can't handle his own strength is no match for Chung-Myung even if 100 people flock.\"Know the subject\u2026\u2026.\"It was that moment.\"I knew it!\"\"Huh?\"Turning his head, Yujong San was looking at him in great surprise.\"Oops!\"Chung-Myung realized his mistake at the moment.Anyway, Yujong San is a human who lives on harmony. Chung-Myung may be able to guess where he came from just by his clumsy flower petals. Of course, if you had an idea, you'd have guessed it to some extent already, but it's not like giving clear evidence.\"As expected, you're from the famous gate. I expected it, but.\"Chung-Myung's face in the mask is distorted.Do you want me to rub it?'Or make sure you never open your mouth...\u2026.\"That neat, fancy sword! High level of airlessness and above all, a gentle feeling of goodness.\"What, do you feel good?You can't do that.As soon as Chung-Myung hesitated to find a way to deal with it, Yujong San shouted with confidence.\"There's only one place in the neighborhood to raise a man who's still young and capable of that! Right away!\"\"Oh, no....\"\"Large Southmen!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung looked at Yujong San with blank eyes.Jong-nam? Why Jong-nam here?\u2026.What?\"Are you from Jongnam?\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"It was thought short, it was quick talk fast.\"Yes, it is!\"\"Of course!\"Yujong San lies down on the ground.\"Please open the door.

If Chung-Myung does not return by morning, the adults of the private sector will know that he is away.Then it's going to be crazy.It is a felony that Mundo escaped from Hwasan without permission. What if I get caught in Chung-Myung's black night clothes?It's hell.I never wanted to see that.\"Calm down.\"\"But the death penalty.\"Yoon-jong shakes his head.\"You're not that stupid. I'll be back before it's too late. As long as there's no accident.\"And no matter how many times I thought about it, I didn't think anything would happen to that monstrous guy. It'll be a little late at best.\"But you don't know people's business, do you?\"\"Right.\"If it's a human being.As soon as Jo-Gol pulled his head out of the window, the door burst open.\"Tsk.\"Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong's heads turned around.\"Priest!\"Chung-Myung was opening the door and coming inside.Chung-Myung, who has a mask in one hand, takes off his night clothes as soon as he closes the door. Then I started to change into a uniform.\"Everything's fine, right?\"\"That's what we're going to ask. Is everything all right?\"\"What's the big deal?\"Chung-Myung grinned.\"I've been treated well, and I've been given money.\"\"Who, who?\"\"What's your name? You... Anyway, there is. The owner of the store.\"\"Huh?\"Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong open their eyes wide. Chung-Myung grinned as he recalled their reaction.'That's not funny. I'much.Yujong San, who guessed that Chung-Myung came from Jongnam to clean up Huasan, easily released all the information Chung-Myung did not need.Nevertheless, he made every effort to imprint his name on Chung-Myung.'Come on.'It's good that things work out so easily, but on the other hand, I couldn't help but feel bitter.On Yujong San's list of prestigious factions in his head, it is clear that Huasan is missing. Even though I saw Chung-Myung's inspection with my eyes, I couldn't think of Hwasan.No matter how much plum blossoms are in practice, Yujong San, who has lived in harmony all his life, should know that Huasan used plum blossoms as a long-term weapon in the past?Considering Hawasan's current history, he may have thought that there could be no one with that ability at an early age, but the bitterness was not going away.\"Bitter things are bitter things, and I'm comfortable with that.'I started this work with the determination to expose my identity, but it would be a good thing if it was completely hidden.\"What happened?\"\"\u2026\u2026Tsk.\"Chung-Myung waved his hand at Jo-Gol's question.\"It's not like they can do anything on their own.

We need to train.\"\"Today, too?\"Chung-Myung glared.\"Listen, death penalty.\"\"Huh?\"\"Whether it rains or snows, it's windy. I don't miss a single day of training from today! It's snowing heavily and there's a cold snap! There's no such thing as a day off when Hawasan collapses!\"Jo-Gol nodded with a stiff face.The sea is ready!'Isn't this why he decided to help and follow Chung-Myung? If you can train and be strong, you can do anything. Training without rest was rather what he hoped for.\"Sort them right. Then you....\"\"Oh, I'm not going.\"\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung turned his head and looked at Yoon-Jeong with a dim face.\"You know how to train, right?\"\"\u2026\u2026right.\"\"Do the same thing.\"\"And you?\"\"I have something else to do.\"Chung-Myung swung his hand and Yoon-jong sighed.\"Okay, let's train ourselves today. But this is the only time.\"Yoon-jong looked a little serious.\"Don't forget that this training is possible because of you. If you don't intend to end it in moderation, you should come out.\"\"I know.\"The reason why the three great disciples of the Baekmaegwan are training hard without making a sound is because Chung-Myung is opening his ax eyes in front of him.

If that's the case, it's only a hundred thousand? I'll pay you back.No, you don't have to pay me back. Because the money originally belongs to Hwasan. The owner takes my money and spends it, and this guy is freezing to death.So somehow all you have to do is prove that those businesses belong to Hawasan. That will solve everything...\u2026.\"If that had happened, I wouldn't be doing this.\"Had it been for the books, Hawasan wouldn't have been sitting on his hands. When he was around, the children under the wing of Hwasan were very smart.If there was evidence, there is no reason why it could not be recovered.According to the situation, when the Magyo invaded, the books were all gone...\u2026.\"Is this because of me?\"My stomach hurts. My stomach.Chung-Myung rolled over the bed.\"No, Jang Moon-sa, you need to keep those important things safe! Safely!\"How much money did it cost? Put it in your place roughly...\u2026.\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung jumped out of his seat.Roughly?A love-hate?\"Can't you?'What kind of person is Jang Moon-sa? Do you mean he keeps such books roughly?'Let's remember.'Chung-Myung was not interested in that at all. I know it takes money to roll the literary circle, but I thought that a true unmanned and a true doer should not dwell on the alien.Looking at the children eating only grass in Hawasan now, I feel like I want to chase myself from the past and break my muzzle, but Chung-Myung at that time was anyway.Therefore, Jang did not show Chung-Myung the books. While sorting out the books, Chung-Myung often slipped away when he came.\"\u2026\u2026Push it?\"I try to revive the blurry memory again.There were no more than three books in the Long March Room. There will be dozens, if not dozens, of books to run Hawasan. Then where did they keep all the books?There's another place!'There was nothing to store such as that in the room of the long writer.He is said to be a long-winded man of the great Hawaiian faction, but he is also a doin. The room of the long writer was nothing short of simple. If you try to fill the chest in the room of a long writer, you won't be able to put anything else in.Besides, I've seen him open the box a few times, but there's no bookkeeping in it. So where is the account?\"So was that true?\"I've heard before that there's a secret warehouse in Hasan that only long-term writers can enter. It was nothing short of a rumour, but it was quite a famous story.Chung-Myung at the time would have been able to find out the truth, but I didn't check it because I wasn't particularly interested.'Wait. Come to think of it...\u2026.'There are a few things that come to mind.Sometimes weird things come in because Hawasan is a prestigious representative of the island. For example, things that people should not learn, such as the rank of the masters of Magongseo and the national convention. Sometimes legendary swords and treasures were obtained.So where did they all go?It is not a re-election. Chung-Myung couldn't have missed it if he was in the re-election.But that doesn't mean it's sold out. There were some things that would go crazy in the strong lake when it was released. Chung-Myung couldn't have not heard it if Jang Moon-hyung had sold such things.Then what?'There is!'There is a warehouse where books and treasures are collected.It's not far from here.I couldn't have emptied Hawasan to get in and out of the warehouse, so I'm sure there's such a place in it. A warehouse that no one can know.But is that possible?That no one knows how to build a warehouse in Hawasan, where martial arts are swarming like mosquitoes, and they don't get caught?Chung-Myung stormed out of the door.There is only one place where that is possible.For now, the entrance must be in the residence of a long-time writer. It's impossible not to get caught if there's an entrance outside the house.A place where no one can enter without permission from a long writer. Such a place in Hawasan is the only place for a long writer.\"The place of a long-time writer has not changed from the past.'What does that mean?Chung-Myung, who ran outside, opened his eyes wide.There is a gentle ridge behind the pavilion where the long writers live.\"If you build a warehouse, you can't help but notice it.'However, there is one way to avoid the eyes of others even if a warehouse is built.It's to build a warehouse in the ground.If they had dug the ground and built a warehouse underneath the living quarters, they would have been discovered by sensitive masters. But what if you built a passage and built a warehouse under that mountain?\"Nobody knows unless it's a ghost.\"Chung-Myung smiled grimly.'There it is.'It's a strange thing to think about.Usually, other members of the clan had a pavilion in the center of the clan where the long-lived people lived. That way, I can look everywhere.Isn't it strange that the emperor lives in the corner of the palace?But the living quarters of the long-time writer is deep in the city. And there is nothing after that.That's all there is to it!Chung-Myung grinned at the small hill behind Jang Moon-in's residence.\"We're going to do a treasure hunt that doesn't even exist.\"I felt the long death penalty bubble in the sky.\"Understand, Long Death. Shouldn't we save Hawasan first? If I can, I'll hand it over to a long writer without touching it.\"If I can. If I can.After I pack what I need to pack.If you don't like it, come back to life.\"Giggling.\"Chung-Myung smiled triumphantly back.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even a small hill was a mountain. It can't be easy to go through the mountains.Moreover, it felt like stealing while taking advantage of the dark night to avoid the eyes of private lodging or private lodging birds.'Oh, my God.'I can't get used to this body at all. In the past, Chung-Myung would not have lost a breath even after three days and nights of light attack. However, this weak body often gasps even if it moves a little.It was the same when I went down to the chords and questioned Yujong San. It was ten times harder to go down and up the mountain than to deal with the loud swordsman, so what would you say?Moreover, what Chung-Myung does now was not an easy task.\"HoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooChung-Myung, who touched the floor, took a deep breath and pushed energy into the ground.What are you doing in the middle of the night?\"Yeah, d*mn it.\"The warehouse will be down here. But the problem is I don't know where it is down here.There's only one way. I'm just checking one by one.Thanks to this, Chung-Myung was now crawling through the mountains, pumping energy from point to point to point to find an empty space. If there is an empty space under the mountain, it must be a warehouse.It's easier said than done.It's easy to say....\"This is where you find a needle in the desert.\"Chung-Myung sighed heavily.In the past, he would have been able to cover a small mountain like this with energy with just one hand. But now, he was limited to shooting long enough, at the most, a finger.\"Oh, my God, I'm dying!\"And it's not like you can keep firing that kind of energy. His inner circle, which should be called brother, quickly came to the bottom, even though he had only used it a few times. Every time I do that, I'm re-energizing my energy and shooting it for the tenth time.\"What if he doesn't have it, then he's just gonna lie?\"'I'm tired, so I can't stop thinking. Chung-Myung blew up the mind penetrating into his head.Arthur, where there is a will, there is a way.\"There must be!\"Considering the nature of the long death penalty and everything else, the books must be kept in a safe place. And this is the only safe place.We need to catch straws. But this hope is more like a floating log than a straw. There's no way I won't!One more time!\"Oops!\"One more time!\"I'm dying!\"One more time!\"Something's empty. It's none of my business. Oops.\"Once...No. Wait a minute.\"What's empty?\"Chung-Myung opened his eyes wide. Squeeze your energy for confirmation and shoot once more.'There is!'I felt something disparate. There's something empty down here. It still has a weak history, so it is not known who created that space or whether it naturally created an empty space.But it was clear that something was empty.Then what?\"Spit it out!\"Chung-Myung spat on the floor and stood up. Then he grabbed the pickaxe next to him.\"You have to check with your eyes!\"Now it's a battle of grit.\"Huh!\"One shovel.\"Turn it off!\"Two shovels.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"Three shovels.Splash.Chung-Myung just collapsed in the pit. The dirt came rushing into my mouth, but now I don't have the strength to spit it out.\"You're dying. You're dying.\"Bloody body.My arms tremble and my legs tremble just by digging five sheets. My back was hurting like a knife hit me.Learning martial arts is familiar with suffering.But pain from hard training and wounds, pain from labor, diverts. Unfortunately, Chung-Myung was not used to the pain of labor.Even if you're used to the pain of labor, it's not something a child can do.Digging a healthy land is hard for even a healthy adult male. Besides, it doesn't work the trick. It's something you have to do purely with strength and grit.\"Spit it out!\"Chung-Myung, who spit out the soil that came into his mouth, glared.Let's see if you win or I win!\"But if you give up here, won't the name Plum Blossom Screening cry?\"Euracha!\"Chung-Myung again vigorously started picking a pickaxe.If there's a space down there, I'll definitely get there!Push! Push! Push!\"Eurachachachachachachachacha!\"Push! Push! Push!\"Huh?\"Like this?Chung-Myung quickly lowered his posture. Then he started peeling off the dirt with both hands. After digging out the soil several times, something hard is touched on the fingertips.Bricks?Chung-Myung's face is distorted. It feels strange to touch the fingertips. I feel a crack in the middle. It's a brick.It may be a good sign that there is something built of bricks underneath these mountains. It means someone created an artificial space.But Chung-Myung's idea was different.If this was the Bidong of Hawasan, it would not have been poorly equipped with bricks. I'm sure they've kept a little tighter around in case someone breaks in.By the way, brick...\u2026.'Let's dig through it for now.'Chung-Myung suppressed his disappointment. Nothing is certain until you see it. For now, the first thing to do is to check with your eyes.Smooth.When the soil was removed, the clear brick pattern was revealed. It was not clear because of the low level of martial arts and the darkness, but it became clear that there was something underneath it.Let's see.Chung-Myung grabbed one of the bricks carefully.It's been a while, so the bricks are tightly interlocked. Pull the bricks with force. But at the same time, be careful not to collapse.Snarling.A brick comes up top.That's right!Chung-Myung, who carefully took out the bricks, pushed his face into the hole that was exposed below.'Now, here....'Chung-Myung, who checked the below with increased safety, slightly frowned.There's nothing down there. All you see is...\u2026.'No way...Oh! The hallway?The fist is clenched automatically.I didn't find it wrong. I found it right, but it just came a little to the side by side. The place he found is not a sinus, but a path leading to sinus. It has not yet been able to detect the exact separation of path and sinus due to lack of ability.But finding the corridor is finding the way to Bidong!'Good!'The moment Chung-Myung looked up and tried to lift up the bricks...\u2026.That'sbuck.There was a low sound of footsteps from the inside.'Huh!'Chung-Myung almost screamed in surprise. Someone is walking this way through the hallway.\"The Long Man?\"He leaned his head back and hurriedly covered the brick he had pulled out. But there was a bigger problem.Oh, my God!Light was leaking through the cracks created by pulling out bricks. Chung-Myung hurriedly covered the bricks with his body and lowered his breathing to perform the homing technique.\"Why now?\"You might get caught if you nod. What would you say if a long man found him digging through the mountains and reaching here?Never get caught.That's it's byeok.The sound of footsteps walking in the dark hallway is getting closer. It wasn't a very quick step.'You're a long man.'The appearance in the dark clearly showed that he was a long writer.Fortunately, Jang Moon-in felt no abnormality and passed by where Chung-Myung was looking down. But there was no sign of relief. This is because the long writer stopped walking soon.'There's a wall...\u2026?'As the eyes get used to the complete darkness, the inner appearance is more evident. A large wall is seen in front of where the long writer stopped walking.No. It's not a wall.It may look like that, but it can't be a wall. The end of a long corridor is called a door, not a wall. The long writer stands still and looks at the door.You knew that.'I expected that to be the case.There would have been no way for others to know the existence of disagreements that Chung-Myung did not know, but it was highly likely that only Jang Moon-in knew. Jang Moon-haeng may have delivered it to the person who will be the long-lived leader of the future in case of an emergency, or he may have stumbled upon it while writing his residence.But the odd thing is why was it that Hawasan was in this state if he knew there was disagreement.I'm sure there were books made by Jang Mun-sa and treasures in Bidong.It was then.The long writer raises his hand and stammers for the wall, or the door. For a long time as if I was touching something precious.What are you doing?'It was a move that I couldn't find out the meaning of.Nevertheless, the reason why I don't want to complain about the appearance is because I can feel a different atmosphere from usual in the writer.Fumbling through the door, he bowed slowly. Then he doesn't move in that position.Only then did I know.I'm not trying to do anything.That's the look of a man who can'Chung-Myung unwittingly bit his lips as he looked back at him.to be smallAnd shabby.The back of a great Hawaiian writer should always be wide and warm. But now his back feels as shabby as that of the old countryside.A back that couldn't be seen by anyone. It's because there's no one here, so you can show that back.I can feel the long writer's back shaking little by little against the wall.'Ah...\u2026'I thought I knew.So you couldn't open it.'Chung-Myung bit his lips gently.My back hurts. It's so cold and painful.The collapsing Hawaiian faction.Muhak is declining and wealth is falling. Those who press for debt become increasingly vicious, and the enemy's blades become sharper and sharper.How desperate would it be to lead Hawasan alone in such a situation?How miserable would it be for a long writer to see his whole life's dedication to the collapse?Nevertheless, I cannot open my heart to anyone. A long writer is something that should be trusted by his or her literary class. He is not a man who can rely on others.Even if everyone collapses, they should support this place firmly like a giant tree with a wide range of roots on the earth.So...So in a place like this, you alone soothe the pain and sorrow.Holding on to the door of disagreement that won't open.Chung-Myung looked down at the back of a long writer. As if to engrave it in his eyes.A long writer who has not moved while holding the door still raises his head.Staring at the door, he then breathed a low sigh and turned away. And slowly went back out of the hallway.Chung-Myung held his breath until the long-winded man's gas completely disappeared. Then he lifted the bricks and jumped down the hall.\"\u2026\u2026Tsk.\"I saw a scene I didn't really want to see.'My fault is great.'Not only that, but the good men's fault was great. The future of Kang Ho is important, but the future of Hawasan was also important. It is important to resolve the immediate crisis, but the children who will be left should have been considered.\"It's not too late.\"If there is a fault, you can take it back. Chung-Myung will now return their lost years.\"Well, then....\"I turned my head and looked at the door.\"Let's open this d*mn door first.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is to check if other institutions do not work when the door is opened.A long death sentence may have caused the signal to go off when someone other than himself opens the vibrancy. He's a very careful man.I don't see anything.'Chung-Myung's eyes were fixed on the top of the corridor, confirming that the device was missing.There's a hole in the child's fist. It's not just one, but one at a time.\"Tsk.\"Originally, there would have been a nightcap. It wasn't a dark corridor that didn't have a single light like now, but a bright corridor where the nightlife shone.Every time I ran out of money, I pulled it out and sold it one by one. Every time that happened, this corridor would have gotten darker and darker.What did the long writer think when he saw the hallway getting darker every time he came in? Don't you think the future of Hawasan is as dark as the hallway gets?\"Turn it off.\"Chung-Myung scratched his head.\"It would have been better if I didn't.\"It's heavy. It's heavy.I knew that. I'm not a fool.Just because Jang Moon-in or his disciples do not show such a figure, it does not mean that he could not even guess what he was thinking. Everyone will not be able to sleep properly by now due to the weight of the name Hwasan and the pressure that he may fail in his own generation.You've been under that pressure all your life.It's not fair.'He's not the only one who's done it. In fact, it's true that he raised the reputation of Hawasan by calling it plum blossom inspection, but because Hawasan's great story went back to the decision of the long writers and elders, not him.Where is this unfair case that Chung-Myung has to do all the cleaning up after all the work done together?Chung-Myung approached the door, kicking his tongue.That's enough complaining. Shall we open the door first?\"By the way... how do I open this?\"Chung-Myung tilted his head.There's no handle on the door. It was only possible to guess that the long line in the middle was the door, but without it, it was safe to say that it was just a wall.\"And what are these lines?\"The long split in the center is a sign of the door interlocking. Then what are these lines that are all over the place? It looks like someone practicing swordsmanship against the wall.\"...is the door correct?\"Chung-Myung, who touched the wall or the door, still pumped his energy inside. However, he had no choice but to step down soon.\"Crazy.\"I can't get out of my energy. This cannot happen to ordinary rocks. There's something scary right behind this rock.\"Long-lasting season.\"It is at least a hand thick.\"\u2026\u2026is the money going to waste.\"It must have made a warehouse out of that expensive permanent iron and surrounded it with rocks.\"That's why he couldn't even think of opening it.\"Whatever the season of eternity is.Smelting with a sword is the best metal in the world that can produce the world's greatest sword, and when armor is made, it can produce the best jewelry that can never be penetrated.The same weight is a treasure trove more expensive than gold. But I can't believe you're making that kind of permanent iron.\"Hahaha.\"Depending on what you think, the long-winded man may look stupid. I can't believe I've left this expensive metal alone.But Chung-Myung could see why the long writer couldn't touch this phlegm. Late iron was literally the hardest metal in the world. Cutting this is impossible even for Chung-Myung now.If it is a permanent season with a thickness of one kilogram, Chung-Myung, who used to inspect plum blossoms in the past, can barely cut it off. Therefore, if we want to cut down on this silk, we need to bring in the best masters in the world.But will such a person withdraw after seeing this treasure?'That can't be true.'If the toothless Hawasan has the treasure, he is guilty of death. The powerful don't let the weak sell the treasure justly. I'll take the treasure at all costs.Hwasan could have been annihilated if he clumsily attracted outsiders.'The choice of the long-term man wasn't bad. Bringing in masters to solve the crisis right now is like bringing in criminals to avoid wolves.'What is inside is also important, but the permanent season is a treasure in itself. This amount of permanent life is equal to a thousand gold.\"The problem is, I can't cut it either\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung's face is slightly distorted.If he was in the past, he could be cut off with his bare hands in this late season. He checks plum blossoms no matter what anyone says! At the height of the sword...\u2026.\"Never mind!\"Let's not talk about the meaningless past.Chung-Myung raised his eyes and watched the promiscuous patterns carved on the wall. If this is the door and Jangmunsa used to come in and out of it, there must be a way to open it.The long death penalty level was not higher than that. So as long as we figure out a way...\u2026.\"Huh? This?\"Twenty-four Plum Blossom?The pattern on the wall, no! Kendo!Some of the swordsway resemble the Twenty-four Plum Blossom. And when the clue was lifted, I could recognize the identity of the other patterns.\"It's a killer. This is plum blossom. And this is a joint right.\"From shallow to dark patterns.There are inscriptions in one place that cannot be mastered unless one of Hawasan's disciples.'That's why the long man can't open it.'Plum Blossom and Plum Blossom are not handed down to Hawasan of Tanggeum. People who know martial arts can follow Turo, but it's impossible to make martial arts based on Turo alone.\"This depth is\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung sighed.\"It's a self-deprecating machine.\"Based on the self-lowering machine, it follows the six-way, bamboo shoots, and the twenty-four plum blossom test, followed by the plum blossom test.That was the way to open this door.If you unfold the sword along the Touro exactly, the door seems to be opened on its own. I don't know how they came up with such an institution.I solved the clue.There is only one problem left.\"\u2026\u2026how am I supposed to unfold this?\"If it's Chung-Myung from the past, it won't be a problem. No, even non-Chung-Myung elders could have opened the door without any difficulty. However, Chung-Myung was nothing but a child who did not learn the art of twenty-four plum blossoms properly.The form of the sword can be followed. However, it was impossible for him to put his strength into this sword and spread it out at once.\"Whoa.\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply.How can you not do something?'Make the impossible possible. There's nothing in the world that can't be done. It's just difficult.Chung-Myung gritted his teeth and put his hands together in the danjeon.\"\u2026\u2026I really don't want to.\"It's not as if we had a life-and-death enemy in front of us. I don't want to overdo this. But this was the only way I could think of.\"Think you're recuperating for a month or so.\"Chung-Myung grinds his teeth. He then operated the internal history and tapped the genital stethoscope, which is located in the deepest part of the power failure.A congenital stethoscope.The power that everyone has since the birth of a human being.It's a different force from the history.Even if you lose all your strength, you don't die. It's just a great sense of helplessness, and it doesn't interfere with your life. This is because history is a force artificially created by humans in the first place.But the congenital stethoscope is different.Human beings who have lost their genital vibrations can no longer sustain their lives. In other words, a congenital tremor is a vital force that sustains human life.Those who are in the state of Muhak can use the genital stethoscope as if it runs in history. But a congenital tremor is the power to sustain life. If you use it, you must be prepared for it.If you consume too much, you face death.Even if consumed properly, the energy is greatly damaged and you cannot live a normal life for a few months.I'm going to use just a little bit. Just a little bit.It's meaningless when Chung-Myung dies to save Hwasan. Now Chung-Myung was perhaps more important than the whole of Hawasan.Talk talk.It stimulates the congenital stethoscope very carefully. It shouldn't come out too much. Just enough! Really, just enough!The stimulated congenital vibrations began to stir. The genital oscillator that rises pushes into the power failure.A little more than I thought.'Chung-Myung blew up his thoughts and grabbed the sword.Is it possible?It has to be possible!It creates a magnificent force by mixing birth control and resistance, and turns the resistance to the whole body by following the operation method of the self-lowering machine. The history of the unfamiliar route shook the whole body.\"Gasp!\"Scream pokes its lips out.Terrible outrage ensued, but Chung-Myung rather glowed his eyes.It's only once! You have to do it at once.'His fingertips are young in purple black.I didn't learn martial arts normally. It was just a clumsy reproduction of the meritorious and unfamiliar bodies that the head remembered.So there's no second time.Chung-Myung's hand travels Ho Gong like a light.A purple trajectory dug into the wall.That play, that play!The sound of scratching against the wall rings a serene homologue. It's integrity that must be unfolded at once, but it's slow because of the limitations of the body and the history.\"Ugh...Ugh!\"I'm having a splitting pain in my Danjeon.But Chung-Myung didn't stop and swung his hand. As the excessive movement continued, the muscles began to hurt as if they were breaking, and the face was burning as if it were bursting.\"I'm the Plum Blossom Checker!'If you don't have the ability, at least fill it up with coming.After biting his tongue at the ceremony to fly away, Chung-Myung finally unleashed the whole struggle.Stand tall.His hand stops at Ho Gong.Is that enough?My legs were shaking and my heart was out of breath, but now I can't afford to care about my body. If it doesn't open like this, it's a real disaster.It was then.Whoosh! Whoosh!I thought I heard a strange sound of metal, and then I snapped! There was a sound of something opening.In time, a huge door moves slightly forward about half the way.\"Ah!\"It's open!I thought the door would open by itself due to the movement of the engine, but only the lock seems to have been released.But somewhere. Now in there...\u2026.\"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"Suddenly Chung-Myung bent over, grabbing his belly.Blood like blood flows from my mouth. Blood pours out through the throat with a force that cannot be swallowed back.\"Tzut.\"Chung-Myung wiped his mouth with his sleeve.It seems that his body has been severely damaged due to the use of more than he thought.At least two months of internal injuries are required at this rate.\"Ha... It's so hard to save the Wasan faction.\"Chung-Myung, who spat out the blood in his mouth, kicked his tongue and pushed the disagreeable door hard.Squeak!Disagree doors, which had been closed for a long time, opened wide from side to side.\"Well, let's see what the long death sentence has hidden.\"Chung-Myung walked into Bidong with a significant smile.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You've been spending money on making this stuff.\"There's a deep surge, but what do you say? I can't argue with people who are already dead.As he mumbled inside, Chung-Myung looked around.There was a lot of stuff in the rain. What do I need to check first?\"Money!\"Chung-Myung blinks his eyes.It should be here! The slush funds saved by Jang Moon-hyung! Gold shining brightly! Such wealth as brilliantly shining pottery...\u2026!\"I should have.\"Chung-Myung looks around and tilts his head.What? Why can't I see it?Chung-Myung opened his eyes wide and looked through the rain. However, no matter how much I wash my eyes and look for it, I can't see anything shiny, let alone wealth.This can't be happening.\"Oh, no.\"No matter how frugal Jang Moon-hyung was, he must have had a lot of money to spend!It would be common sense to deal with the crisis in Hasan or to set aside a certain amount of wealth to use in an unexpected situation.\"But why don't you have any money?\"A great deal of sadness is coming in.Ha, you son of a b*tc*. Didn't you have any slush funds?Chung-Myung rubbed his face.If there was a slush fund hidden by a long writer, it could have been used in many good places.To revive Hawasan, go to the gill, go to the gillustration.\u2026.\"Oh, no, no, no! I'm purely for the revival of Hwasan!\"I think I hear someone kicking their tongue from somewhere.\"Sad.\"Chung-Myung, who abandoned his lingering desire, turned his head. In fact, there is something more important than wealth.\"This is it!\"Books lined up on a bookshelf on one side of the non-dong wall.Chung-Myung swallowed a dry saliva and approached the bookshelf.\"This should be right.\"Pick up the book you see in the middle and go through the contents. There was a smile on Chung-Myung's face, who was reading each letter.\"Right!\"It can't be gone!As expected, the books on display in the first book store were Hawasan's books, arranged one by one by one by the long-time writer. They were supposed to be in the re-election, but they seemed to have been made and collected to organize documents that only long-term writers could know, and to prepare for any possible situations.There were books of the Chung-Myung era as well as those of its predecessors. With this, I can slap those bastards in the back of their heads.\"They're all dead!\"This alone is worth the trouble of opening the sinus.And in the second book store...\u2026.\"Oh, my God!\"It's a bad grade!Chung-Myung almost screamed without realizing it.There are actual Hawasan's ranks here...\u2026.\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung tilts his head.\"These aren't real kids.\"Chung-Myung has narrowed his forehead. It's a bit of a class, but what's here is a bit different from the martial arts you usually learn. In Hwasan, the ranks of almost dead martial arts are now collected one by one.\"Well.\"Chung-Myung scratched his cheek.\"What a wistful man you are you?\"I decided not to pass it on to future generations, but everyone must be Hwasan's Muhak. It seems that it was uncomfortable for a long writer to completely scrap and eliminate such martial arts.In case the loss of martial arts had a negative impact on Hasan's future, such martial arts were gathered here.If the first book proves the obligation of a long-term writer to Hawasan, this second book contains the long-term concern and affection of Hawasan.\"\u2026\u2026long death sentence.\"Cheung-Myung, teary-eyed, skimmed through his nose.\"Don't worry, I'm sure I'll get Hwasan back to normal.\"No, I'll make it more prosperous than it used to be.Chung-Myung smacked his lips and turned around.There's no grade, but it's fine. After all, the important martial arts convictions are all in Chung-Myung's head. It's just annoying to write it down, but it doesn't have to be a secret. It's enough to make it up.And finally...\u2026.There was nothing in the third library.There is only one rolled scroll in the empty library.\"What's this?\"Chung-Myung reached out without hesitation and opened the scroll. And then I started to read it all in a minute.// ModifyA long-written friend.If someone is reading this, it may mean that the next generation of writers has been decided. Sometimes a line of writing conveys more than a hundred words, so I have to leave my meaning in writing.The position of Hawasan's long arm is by no means a position to lead him.As the latter would already know, those who lead Hawasan are his disciples and children who are growing up in Hawasan. Long writers are just enough to protect and push them to do their best.Now that you have become a long-time writer of Hawasan, I hope you don't feel anxious to lead him. Hwasan is just Hwasan. No one can lead, no one can swing.My wife.Remember when you're tired of the difficulties of reality and the heavy burden that weighs on your shoulders.Hwasan's spirits do not abate.Hwasan is just Hwasan. Whether that spirit is declining or flourishing in the world, Hwasan is just Hwasan. As a long writer, what the latter has to protect is the spirit of Hawasan and its period.So that the good men's will can continue to the future. And raise our descendants and continue our will so that they will not change forever.I leave you a heavy burden as a good man and a long-time writer of the previous generation.Cheon Mun, the great Hawaiian pie in the twenty-day period.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung still looked at the writing on the scroll.I know.This is not what Jang Moon-Hyung left for Chung-Myung. But it's a coincidence. The person who needs to read this is Chung-Myung, not anyone else.\"What a... nag.\"Chung-Myung sighed and put the scroll in his arms.Others will have to be returned to Hawasan, but this scroll cannot yield to a long-time writer.\"Well, then....\"Chung-Myung grinned and turned away.\"I've got nothing more than I thought, but I'm sure this is good enough.\"For now, it is important to get the books. With that book, we can take back all the businesses in Hawasan. Then we can get out of debt that is now squeezing Hasan.So at this point...\u2026.Chung-Myung, who was about to go outside, stopped.'Wait a minute.Something's a little off.What's wrong with you?'I can't pinpoint exactly what's strange, but I can't help but feel uncomfortable.Why do I feel like this?\"Wait a minute.Third stop?Chung-Myung's head turned around.Long death penalty.So, the twenty-day-old writer of Hawasan, Cheon Mun, is a slightly necrophobic person. Therefore, Cheon Mun's room was always tidy.It's not just the level of clean people. All the furniture and bedding were arranged at angle, and even he couldn't stand himself without symmetry between left and right.by the wayTwo bookshelves full of bookshelves on one side, and one scroll on the other?\"No, no. That can't be true.\"I know because I've been through a long death sentence! There can be no such thing for us!Chung-Myung rushed to the empty library.There's something!'There must be!That awkward empty bookcase keeps bothering me. You put up a bookshelf to deliver that letter? The long death penalty Chung-Myung knows is never like that.It wouldn't have been awkward if it wasn't Chung-Myung who came in here but a long-time writer of the future! But it's none other than Chung-Myung who's here now.Chung-Myung grabbed the bookshelf. Then, without hesitation, he lifted it to the side and moved on.'There can be no device out there.'So there can't be anything behind the bookshelf. That side is covered with permanent iron. But what if it's down there?Of course, the floor will be covered with a single iron. But?Chung-Myung, who moved the bookshelf, touched the floor. And soon the quenched begins to attract.\"If it's the long death penalty I know, here it is!'If there's an awkward place, it's a trap.Woooow!But nothing happened. I wonder if I lack strength, so I pulled something out, but there is no change.'No?'It was the moment when I tried to give up because I thought I made a mistake.Up and down.\"\u2026\u2026!\"Here it is!\"Eurachachachachachachachachachachachachacha!\"Chung-Myung pulled out his wet power and pulled the floor.Rattling!Soon, with a feeling of something falling out, Chung-Myung lost his balance and rolled on the floor.\"Ouch, ouch.\"The stars flashed in front of me after hitting the back of my head a few times.I hope you didn't say anything out loud.'Instinctively, he turns his head towards the entrance. But there's no sign that the long writer has noticed. Although it is said to lead to a place of residence, it will not be easily recognized because it will be distant and soundproof.More than that!Chung-Myung jumped up and ran forward.Something's definitely open.Chung-Myung, who ran back to the spot, clenched his fist as he saw a hole in the floor.\"Of course it is!\"What kind of person is he?\"He's a very thorough man.\"In case a person who is not a long-time writer opens the door and enters the room, the floor has been made double in case.If you've been through a lot, you'll never imagine that there's another kind of sinus hidden in the sinus. Even Chung-Myung would have left without knowing what kind of person Jang Moon-sa was.purpleLight is gushing out of that entrance!The light!As if to give Chung-Myung light, a subtle glow pours out.Chung-Myung pushed himself into the hole exposed to the floor without hesitation. A small entrance that's tight enough even though it's still a small child's body. Passing through the entrance, there was a space so low that it was hard to straighten out.There is...Chung-Myung reached out. Then, he carefully covered the kite with difficulty.\"Whoosh, whoosh!\"The sound won't leak anymore, will it?So...Chung-Myung opened his eyes wide. Breathing is tight and the heart beats. Blood is rushing to my face and I feel like I'm about to burst.But what about anything?\"Hehehehehehehehehehehehe!\"I'm dying of joy!Happiness is in front of him.On one side, neatly stacked gold bars.And various beams arranged at the other end.And...\"Is this a gravestone?\"Unidentified jewels, even the rank of rain!\"Hehehehehehehehehehe!\"I keep bursting out laughing. Even though I tried to control myself, a silly smile flowed out of control.\"Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe!\"Yes, let's smile! Smile!\"I'm rich now!\"Eventually, the twenty-day long story of Hawasan, Cheon Mun, wanted to avoid it at the expense of a fortune.It was the moment when the fate of Hawasan passed on to the person who should not enter the most.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, for those who have a hard time living the next day, there is nothing more to blame than that sunshine.It's morning again.'Eventually the day started again.It's already been two days. Until the date the princess said, all that remains is oil.Oil. Just oil.Hyun Jong closed his eyes.\"Oil.\"Failing to raise a hundred thousand in that short time, Hawasan will be deprived of all warlords and put out on the streets.There are three things that make people live.righteousness, and expression, and finally state.To lose one's place to live means to live no longer.Of course those who belonged to Hawasan will somehow find another life. But Hawasan will no longer be able to retain the name Hawasan.Those who have a will and will may remain to carry on the name of Hawasan, but it's just a name. For many years, Hawasan, a prestigious man, was sentenced to death.If the huge civilization, which had thousands of disciples, is reduced to about a dozen, and if it continues in the form of a home appliance warrior, can we say that it has not been extinct?Those who have lost their residence have no choice but to disperse. There will be people who follow him for a while, but when they are at a loss for life, they will all find their own way.That's how....'No.'Hyun Jong shook his head violently.This is not the time to think weakly.'There is still oil left. If you somehow raise money in it, you can protect Hawasan.He is a long storyteller of the Grand Hwasan. Never give up until the day Hawasan disappears. Everyone else is entitled to give up, even if they can.Hyun Jong raised his hand and rubbed his face.Everyone who had a nail-sized relationship with Hawasan reached out. A book of Hawasan's circumstances is being distributed to the world. Among them, there may be one person who can help Hawasan.If someone helps one person...\u2026.Hyun Jong laughed unconsciously.'Helping.'If I had any intention of helping, I would have already helped. Even when there was nothing left to receive from Hawasan, there was no help.But who even lends a fortune of 100,000 dollars to the now ruined Hawasan?It's heavy.You can't avoid it and you can't ignore it. However, Hyun Jong was overwhelmed by this weight that weighed on him day by day.The burden of Hawasan's losing touch with his generation was unbearable in his sober mind. I prayed and prayed that tomorrow morning would not come in the ensuing sleepless night.It was then.\"Long man!\"Hyun Jong hurriedly rearranged the chair.No matter what his stomach is, he should not show this to his disciples. Even if Hwasan goes under tomorrow, he has to be remembered only for his noble self as a long-time writer.\"What's going on?\"\"Well, I think you need to come out for a minute.\"\"Hmm?\"Hyun Jong tilted his head.But I'll think for a while. Hyun Jong got up from his seat and went outside. Outside the door, the sword stood with a slightly frozen face.\"Fortune?\"Hyun Jong narrowed his forehead.It's not a cloud rock, it's a cloud sword. Isn't Ungum in charge of the White House now? If Unam came, it means something happened in Hwasan, and if Unam came, it means that there was a problem with the white plum.But what happens at the White Plum that a long-time writer has to hear in personally.Is that in the early morning like now?\"What happened?\"\"Now, the long-winded man.\"The face of the sword is strange. He seemed to be very surprised, very sick of it.What the hell is going on?It was very heart-consuming to teach children who did not understand words properly and who were not yet grown up. Being chosen as the right person for such a job tells how calm Ungum is.But even such a fortune-teller is not keeping his composure at the momentarily.\"I'll go and tell you the details. Jang Moon In! You have to go in person.\"\"\u2026\u2026Get ahead of yourself.\"Hyun Jong followed the fortune-teller without saying a.kabuta.It is not difficult to ask the circumstances. But it's not too late to go and listen to it.\"Yes, long-time man!\"The Ungold sword spread the light and advanced. Hyun Jong followed suit without delay.Where are we going?'Hyun Jong slightly frowned. It is not the White House where the Ungum is headed. It was Yeonhwabong Peak, which connects to the back of the White Plum Hall.What about Yeonhwabong?However, the fortune-teller climbed Yeonhwabong with all his might if he did not intend to answer his questions.We'll find out when we get there.'As I climbed Yeonhwabong halfway along Ungum, I saw the three great disciples sitting here and there on the side of the road.'Huh?'What are those kids doing over there? And why do all the kids look like...\u2026?Hyun Jong opened his eyes wide.Children were lying on the left and right sides of Thoreau climbing to Yeonhwabong Peak. Even though a long writer came, he couldn't even raise his head and gasped.\"What is this?\"The fortune-teller was furious.\"Guys, can't we have an example right now when the long man is here?\"\"Let it go.\"\"One, the long man.\"\"More than that, what happened to the children?\"\"That's\u2026\u2026.\"The sword turned its head away while reading the countenance.\"Chung-Myung! Where is Chung-Myung?\"Chung-Myung? Why does that name come from here?Hyun Jong looked at the Ungold sword with a face that he couldn't understand at all. I think Chung-Myung is referring to a new kid who just came into Hawaii, why would he call him?\"Here you are.\"The answer came before the question was answered.Hyun Jong's eyes opened when he turned his head to the side where he heard the answer instinctively.\"You, you, why, huh?From behind the tree walked Chung-Myung, a grotesque skeleton.His face was whiter than a blank sheet, and his lips turned bluish. The black shade under the eyes is almost down to the chin.In short, it is not the appearance of a man.There seemed nothing strange about falling down and dying right away.\"What the hell happened?\"\"Oh, I'm sorry. I've over-trained...\u2026.\"What the hell are you talking about?If a man looks like that just because he trained, not a single person would have survived. You have to say something that makes sense.Then the Woongeom hurriedly opened his mouth.\"That's not the point right now.\"Hyun Jong glared at the moment.Doesn't it matter?\"What are you talking about?\"I can't believe you're talking about this shit!The White House is the future of Hawasan. The three great disciples at the White House are not the only ones who will lead Hawasan in the future. But no one else said that...\u2026.\"You have to come here. Chung-Myung found something strange.\"\"Strange thing?\"\"Oh, come on!\"The attitude of the fortune-teller is so urgent.'No...\u2026'If someone else had shown this attitude, he would have yelled right away, but the person who is fretting in front of Hyun Jong is none other than Ungum. The calmest rhyme in Hawasan runs wild like a foal on its tail.Hyun-jong eventually followed Chung-Myung and Ungum into the bushes as if possessed.\"What the hell is\u2026\u2026.\"Hyun Jong's words didn't last much longer.The ground dug into his sight and the old box beneath it came in. The entrance to the box was half open.Hyunjong's eyes are getting bigger.can seeSomething golden was shining inside the half-open box. There is only one metal in the world that emits that golden light.But it wasn't just gold that caught Hyun Jong's eye. The book lying next to the gold.The title of the book was even sucking Hyun Jong's soul.\u1103\u1162Hwasan Pahwahwahwahyeon Business Department \u300eA d*mn long title and the number attached to it.\"This, this, this...\u2026?\"Hyun Jong couldn't get his act together.Why do you mean this is coming from here? Why do you even mean it comes with that gold?It is scary to approach the unbelievable reality. He is afraid that those things will disappear like a mirage if he reaches out for nothing.\"Yi, how did you find this?\"\"That kid found it.\"\"That kid?\"Hyun Jong's head is turning. Chung-Myung looks like a walking corpse.\"Yi, how did you find this?\"Chung-Myung opened his mouth with a half-dead face.\"New, Dawn\u2026\u2026I'm going to the early morning training...\u2026.\"\"What?\"Listening to a mosquito-like voice, Hyun Jong tilts his head. Then the fortune-teller gave me a sneak interpretation.\"I think it means that I climbed Yeonhwabong for training at dawn.\"\"When did you start doing that at dawn?\"\"It's been a while since we started. Since that kid came.\"\"Huh?\"Ever since that kid came.How long has that kid been here?'Oh, no. This isn't what's important right now.'You can weigh the details later.\"So you were climbing Yeonhwabong for early morning training when you found this?\"\"To be exact, I was so tired that I was going to rest inside the bushes, but the seat was strangely hard, so I looked at the floor and something was sticking out. So I dug it just in case...\u2026.\"\"Oh, my dear.\"By the way... ..the stuff inside is so...\u2026 it's unusual, so I'd rather inform the superiors of the private sector than check it myself.I think it's right to do it.\"\"Tur, take your time. What kind of training are you doing to make a letter of return?\"\"Training is\u2026\u2026 the root of no man\u2026\"\u2026.\"\"Well, I get it. You're in love with her for a while! I'll check it myself.\"Hyun Jong swallowed his dry saliva and approached the chest. Then he put his trembling hand into the chest. His hands touched not the brilliant gold that caught everyone's attention, but the books next to it.\"Hwasan Pahon Pahon Business Department.\"Taking out each book, Hyun Jong murmurs as if he is out of his mind. A trembling hand told me how turbulent his mind was now.I didn't even think about opening a book. If you open a book clumsily and this old book crumbles, you won't be able to close your eyes even if you die.\"The Great Hawaiian Parcelor.\"This was clear from the history of Hawasan. It may not play a substantial role as a book, but it is a book that might be more important for the Hawasan writer.Hyun Jong's eyes, where he carefully put down the books he took out, came to the title of the book, which was laid down lightly.\"Chi, chi, chi...\u2026.\"His eyes twitch.\"Chi, Chilmae, the black book?\"My whole body is shaking.\"This is where...\u2026. This is\u2026\u2026.\"\"Come on, Long Writers!\"\"Growl.\"Hyun Jong's body, whose consciousness flew white, fell back.\"Long man!\"\"Get a hold of yourself!

Open your eyes.\"Hyun Jong was surprised and opened his eyes.\"Dream?\"I just woke up and found my chest still in front of him. Fortunately, it was not a dream.\"Woo, fortune-teller!\"\"Yes, long-time man!\"\"Call the children. Move that box to the Long Moon House right now! And have your ships guard the perimeter of your residence!\"\"Yes, long-time man!\"\"No, no, no! I'll move it myself! Right now!\"Hyun Jong took a deep breath and calmed down.Nothing is certain yet. In order to accurately understand the situation, we need to call in a financial footnote to see if those items are genuine.butIt can't be real!'Why were they buried in Yeonhwabong if they weren't genuine? With so much wealth.\"No, no, no! No! Still, everything has to be clear.'There was a cross between hope and anxiety in him. Has his stomach been so agitated in recent decades?\"Fortune!\"\"Yes! A long writer.\"\"Take your things and go down the mountain!\"\"Yes, sir!\"Chung-Myung was seen in Hyunjong's eyes when he jumped out of his seat.\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161!\"\"Yes, a man of long letters.\"\"Well done. Let's talk about the details later!\"\"Yes.\"When Chung-Myung stepped back without saying much, Hyun Jong hurriedly lifted the whole box. Then I asked Chung-Myung for the last time.\"Take the children and go to the White House.\"\"I will.\"\"Sure!\"It was not long before Hyunjong opened his eyes and began to climb down the mountain. The fortune-teller rushed after him. The remaining children at Yeonhwabong stared blankly at the scene.\"What's going on here?\"\"\u2026\u2026I know?\"In the midst of the confused children, Chung-Myung smiled.'That's enough for now.'The wealth and rank in the ark are only a small part of what was in it.Why did you give me a portion?It's not Hwasan's, it's Chung-Myung's...\u2026. No, not that!You'll get indigestion if you eat in a hurry.'If you feed a person who is dying of hunger to nourish him or her, his or her body can't stand it. As proof of that, isn't that enough to take the breath of a long writer?It's not necessarily good to release a lot.Now, as Chung-Myung judges, Hawasan is incapable of handling the stuff in his comments. It's too much to ask a seriously ill patient to run right away. First of all, you have to start over.Of course, Chung-Myung is a toddler, but from their point of view it's never a toddler.Then Yoon-jong approached Chung-Myung and said carefully.\"Priest.\"\"Huh?\"\"Since the governor told us to go down, shouldn't we go back to the White House for now?\"Chung-Myung nodded.\"You should.\"\"But what's wrong with you, priest?\"\"Well, that's what happened.\"Chung-Myung shook his hand.'You don't know what I'm talking about.'Thanks to the use of the congenital stethoscope, my physical condition deteriorated every minute.I should have used it less.'It can't be helped. In the past, a sense of quaint was close to perfection, but now it hasn't reached that level. And now his body is different from his body in many ways.Use only the right amount, first drawing out the sensitive energy of the congenital stethoscope with a new body? If that was possible, he would be called an atheist, not a censor.\"You look like you're about to die.\"\"I won't die.\"\"Really?\"\"...want to die?\"Yoon-jong slightly turned away without answering.What?Shut up, did you really want me to die? I think it's weird that he's peeling his eyes off.\"You're not dying, so don't expect it.\"\"What kind of expectation did you expect? Hmmm.\"Chung-Myung clicked his tongue.'What a month or two.'Birth control doesn't recover so easily. Even if you live in Jeongyang carefully, you have to suffer for two months to regain your original body. If not, take your pills.\"But how did you just find it? Seeing that the writer is surprised, it doesn't seem to be an ordinary product.\"\"If you live a good life, heaven will bend over and look after you. So be a good boy.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"If Chung-Myung is blessed, others are already on the boat. But no one could bring themselves to say that.Chung-Myung glanced down and looked at a long man running down Yeonhwabong.If you've given him this much, he'll take care of himself.'I'm not a fool.\"Come on, let's go down.\"\"You should. But\u2026\u2026 where are you going?\"\"Why?\"\"Don't we have to go this way to get down?\"Yoon-jong pointed down.\"What are you asking me?\"\"But why do you go up there?\"\"Tsk, tsk, tsk.\"Chung-Myung, who clenched his tongue as if he were pathetic, looked at Yoon-jong and said.\"Death penalty.\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"\"To be a master, you have to be flexible in thinking. Don't think it's just one way down. It's one of the many ways to get to the top and get down.\"What the hell are you talking about, you nut job!\"Well, the long man is the long man, and we have to do what we have to do. Ten people who come in last today don't have rice. Run!\"Undoubtedly complaining, Yoon-jong's feet began to run toward the top. And the other kids ran to the top in a panic.\"That son of a b*tc*!\"What are ghosts doing? I'm not gonna take him!\"Chung-Myung, who was watching the children running to Yeonhwabong with all his might, smiled and turned his head.\"I gave you the first gift.\"What else should I prepare next time?There's still a lot of stuff out of the beadong. The wealth stored in the chest is less than ten minutes compared to the wealth found in Bidong.Chung-Myung glanced up at the sky. It seems that the long death penalty looks at him with a distorted face.\"Hey, don't tell me I'm going to eat it alone.\"Just enough. Just enough. What? In moderation\"Heehee.\"Chung-Myung smiled and followed the children up.* * *\"It's genuine.\"It felt like my heart was pounding. It is a natural answer, and the shock has not diminished a bit, even though it is already expected.Hyun Jong couldn't hide his nervousness and asked back.\"Are you sure?\"\"Yes, I'm sure. The books are obviously genuine, and we have secured the certificate underneath the wealth. Long story!\"\"Huh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...\"I know I have to say something, but I can't say anything. I had no choice but to make a hoarse sound as if it were deflating.\"Uh, how did this happen?\u2026.\"\"There you go! There you go! Long story!\"\"Huh...\" Hahaha.\"I try to hold it in, but I keep smiling.It's the world that doesn't know what's going to happen, but can these precious things be found at this time?What if it was discovered a week later?I don't even want to think about it.'God has bent over and over again.'No, it's not genius. Hwasan's predecessors, who were watching them in the line, must have helped him.Neither of them are very different words.Hyunjong closed his eyes tightly. I can't hide this passion.\"So you can prove what's on the books?\"\"These are certificates from the country. Of course I can prove it! You can bring back the harmony businesses including Taehwa-ru right now.\"\"That's great, that's great.\"It's a miracle.Maybe he's the one who'll be out in the street in a week. But with these certificates and ledgers, not only can we protect the offices of Hawasan, but we can recover all the low-pitched businesses.It's a big hit, pure and simple.Hyun Young, the finance footnote, chuckled.\"I don't think so, but even if all of this is fake, the crisis is over right now. Even if the wealth contained in the chest is not enough, it is well over 100,000 pieces. I still pay back all the money they ask me to pay back.\"\"That's a relief. I'm so glad.\"\"With this money, we can solve the financial problems of Hasan at once. And if they can confiscate their businesses, they won't have to worry about money.\"Every time I hear it, only good sounds come out. In Hyun Jong's ears, the voice sounded like the imprisonment of a tax-saving man.\"That's not all.\"Hyun Sang, a non-footnote, smiled softly.\"I think the sword is also the original. I need to research a little more, but as far as I've checked, there are no special errors. And there's Hawaiian Muhak's unique pleasure, penance, and zenith.\"\"Oh, oh.\"And it's also encouraging to see the grade of the Falling Sword. The Nakhwa sword is not a painful martial arts like the Chilmae sword, but it can completely fill in the steps before learning. It will be an intermediate process to move from a jin-yut-gum to a chil-gum to a chil-gum.\"\"Well, I see.\"\"Other than that, bamboo shoots, rock scents, and chilsungbo seem genuine.\"I'm completely out of my mind.Hyun Jong consciously dropped the honorifics. If I talk a lot here, I think I'll look ugly.\"The fact that the Chilseongbo, which had been in practice, was beyond description. Chilsungbo is the foundation of all Hawaiian martial arts. If you teach your children, they'll be able to move on to a better position without disrupting the martial arts they've learned so far.\"\"Isn't it the same for us?\"\"Of course. Long death penalty.\"\"Hwasan's scarlet. It's Hongbok.\"At that time, Hyun Sang, who was reading the eyes of the long writer, opened his mouth as if he was trying to say something and closed it.And Hyun Jong didn't miss the hint.\"Is there a problem?\"\"No, I don't. I guess it's old woman's heart.\"\"Did you get caught up in martial arts?\"\"Not at all. This martial arts is genuine. I can put my neck on it and guarantee it.\"\"Well, that's a relief.\"When Jang Moon-in nodded, Hyun Sang also glossed over the situation with a smile.\"Did you say that the three great disciples discovered this?\"\"Yes, this is Chung-Myung, who just joined the company.\"\"You have to lower the table.\"\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Thanks to the child, Hwasan...\u2026.\"\"It's not like that. \"The Long Writers.\"Hyun Young, the financial footnote, cut off Hyun Jong's words and came in.\"She's just a baby. How long will it take to have a heart for Hawasan?\"\"\u2026\u2026right.\"\"Even if the child doesn't recognize the value of this account and the secretary, he can't have known the value of these wealth. As soon as I opened the box, I would have flown with the object without looking back. Or bury it and hide it.\"A slightly vulgar word came out. This means that Hyun Young is excited. But there was nothing more wrong than that.\"I see. I didn't think that far.\"\"I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. It's a fortune that will shake the heart of anyone who decides to bury their bones in Hawasan. Even if I had seen this wealth, could I have told you right away...\u2026.\"\"I'll remember that.\"\"\u2026\u2026Now, the long man?\"Hyun Young's face was embarrassed. Hyun Jong burst into laughter looking at the face.\"I see. I'm proud of you. Yeah, I guess Hawasan got lucky.\"Hyun Jong smiled happily.Although coincidences and coincidences overlap, the introduction of Chung-Myung led to the discovery of this ark. I never thought changing my mind and bringing in a child would save Hasan.\"Hyun Young.\"\"Yes, a man of long letters.\"\"It's true that this account is correct, right?\"\"You can hang your neck.\"\"I see. Then there are people to call.\"Hyun Jong's eyes were filled with heavy energy.It's time to punish those who avenged Hawasan's kindness.\"Everyone involved, stop by Hasan.\"Hyun Jong, a great Hawaiian writer, straightened his shoulders.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The guards are pushing him, but it's not easy to climb this steep road.You have to climb the cliff of a slope that people cannot pass by, relying on an old rope. That's why Hwasan can't develop only when he develops.'If you get paid, you'll never climb this rough place again.'Because I don't want to see wasan anymore.Barely climbed the cliff, a little flat came out. Gong Munyeon of Taehwa Luju looked back and confirmed that everyone had climbed and opened his mouth.\"Let's take a break here.\"\"Oh, my princess. That's a good idea. My legs are shaking...\u2026.\"\"The owner needs to exercise.\"\"Hahaha, I don't hear any lack of physical strength, but no matter how hard I climb this mountain, I can't get used to it.Yes.\"\"So ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\"The shopkeeper shook his head and sat on the rock.\"By the way, Princess.\"Huasan Daru's rouge infection approaches Gong Munyeon, who was slowly reading the room.\"What's wrong?\"\"Why is the long man suddenly asking me to come to Hawaii?\"The eyes of those who were rubbing their legs were all focused on Gong Munyeon.\"Maybe they've come up with the money?\"Gong Munyeon smiled softly.\"Can't you can't do that. A hundred thousand dollars is not that small of a money.\"Gong Munyeon put it bluntly.\"But if you're borrowing...\u2026.\"\"There is no one in the world who will lend 100,000 sheep to the failing Hawasan. A man with such a kind heart wouldn't have been so rich.\"\"Certainly...\"Yujong San shrugs his shoulders.\"What do you think, Princess? Why do you think the long writer called us?\"\"You're trying to make things right, aren't you?\"\"What's going on?\"Gong Munyeon turns his head and looks at the top of Hawasan. There's a Hawaiian up there.\"I don't have any money to come out of, and it won't work if I beg that I don't have any money on the reimbursement date, so I think I'm going to call them in advance and figure out another way.\"\"Huh.\"Yujong San clicked his tongue.\"You mean someone who doesn't have the money to pay you back should come and go? I've never seen such a stiff debtor in my life.Yes.\"\"It's said you're in trouble with your wealth. In the first place, other than the great writer of Hawasan. Don't say anything too harsh.\"\"The princess is very fast. Do you still want to think so well of someone who borrows money and hasn't paid it back in decades?\"Gong Munyeon smiled awkwardly.\"Let's keep our manners. Isn't it too harsh to make the name Hwasan miserable until the end anyway?\"\"The whole world will know the heart of the princess.\"\"You have a different personality.\"\"Don't mention it.\"Gong Munyeon preached and paid tribute.Yujong San clicked his tongue inside as he saw it.You're sitting there for nothing.'If you're planning to repossess and evict the building anyway, what's courtesy? I would like to thank the people who are being treated for their courtesy.'By the way...'Yujong San looked up and looked at the top.'There's no way you're gonna lose the money.'I was always wondering if I could sell them at the right price just because I was going to receive them. Gong Munyeon bragged about it, but if it takes money, isn't it better to worry first?But now Yujong San is not worried.'Cause you're from Jongnam, you're sure you're interested?'In the past, the whole world knew that Hawasan and Jongnam were visiting each other.Now that the existence of Hawasan has been forgotten and Jongnam is rising high, it has become a faded story, but the resentment that has lasted for hundreds of years would not have easily gone away.What's more, aren't the leaders of Jongnam now those who remember the days when Hwasan used to crush Jongnam? If the grudge still lingers, it is clear that those buildings in Hawasan will not be allowed to remain in the world and prove its history.\"I'm sure the princess intends to sell her war chest to Jongnam.'Yujong San's heart warmed up.One hundred thousand.Among them, he has to receive as much as five thousand dollars.What a big sum of money 5,000 nyang is. With a hermitage, an ordinary family can live on for a month. But it's not a hermitage, it's 5,000 golds!With that money, you don't have to do business. Even if you spend moderately, you will be able to spend it for generations and generations and generation.Now the long, long tug-of-war is over. At the thought of finally getting the money, Yujong San's heart began to flutter.I wonder what a long man looks like.'I can't help laughing at the thought of that solemn face being distorted. There was also a bit of bitterness, but Yujong San slinked down his rising compassion. Don't you have no family or friends in front of money?\"Well, let's stop going up.\"\"Yes.\"Everyone seemed to be having a hard time, but no one asked to rest a little longer.The dead, blinded by money, began climbing Hawasan again.\"I mean, it's weird here every time I look at it.\"Someone was being facetious.\"It's just a building that's falling down.\"There is a reluctance in the way you speak.Falling buildings and walls. And the front door where the door came off.It was obviously a ruined or already ruined Munpa. Nevertheless, there is something strange that catches the eye of viewers.The weight of Hawasan, who has protected the island for hundreds of years.I wouldn't say, but everyone was sharing the same feeling.But he turns a blind eye.They are now here to take the breath of the Hawasan. If they don't accept the long-winded proposal today, Hawasan won't last just seven weeks and nights.Hawasan's reputation, which has protected the chord for hundreds of years, is finally cut off.\"Hmmm.\"\"Huhuhuhuhm!I know how heavy the job is. Everyone coughed in silence.I don't mean to turn a blind eye to the reality of money, but for those born in harmony, Hawasan is a meaningful place in many ways. With the situation of cutting off the breathing room of such a place with his own hands, he has no choice but to hesitate.\"Let's go in.\"Gong Munyeon is the only one keeping a nonchalant face. As he took the lead, everyone hesitated and soon followed him with an awkward face.\"Are you here?\"Entering the main gate, Unam greets them.\"Woonamjin. Long time no see.\"\"I'm still not good enough to be called a true person. Please call me Unam.\"\"If you do, I'll call it's a stamp. Do you mind?\"Unam smiled silently.\"There's a man waiting for you. This way.\"\"Well.\"Gong Munyeon slightly frowned.\"You look relaxed.'When they came the other day, the ships blocked them with a pale face. However, the appearance of Unam now shows no urgency like the other day.No matter how long the writer called them and knew they would arrive by this time, isn't it normal to show the basic inconvenience?Gong Munyeon stared at the back of Unam and began to walk after him.I don't know, maybe this is who he really is.Maybe he admitted that everything was coming to an end and let it go. Therefore, it may not be the appearance of a person who is obsessed with money and uncomfortable as before, but rather shows the true nature of Hawasan.You're worried about me.'Maybe it's because the moment has finally come when everything you want comes true. Ordinary people tend to let their guard down as soon as they reach their goal, but Gong Munyeon is a person who gets more nervous at times like this.As I walked along Unam, a long writer's residence came out. And in front of him, there was already a Hawaiian long-written Hyun Jong waiting for them.\"I'm seeing a man of letters.\"When Gong Munyeon first took control, those who followed him bowed their heads in unison.He seems to have engraved his words that he wanted to keep his manners on his way to the end.\"Welcome. Thank you for coming to the rough road.\"Hyun Jong, a long writer of Hawaiian, smiled softly and greeted everyone.\"I'm sorry to take up your time in the midst of your desperation. Please understand the difficulties you have to go down there in person, even though you know it's polite.\"\"Don't mention it. We're busy, but we can't be busier than a long writer. Of course, we have to come.\"Gong Munyeon also received Hyun Jong's words with a smile.\"More than that...\u2026?\"\"Haha, what's the rush? You must have had a hard time climbing the mountain, but a cup of tea...\u2026.\"\"The Long Man.\"Gong Munyeon cut off his horse in a polite but determined tone.\"It's good to enjoy tea and have a chat. But we're low-key merchants. I'd like to discuss work-related issues first, rather than customs.\"\"Hmm.\"\"They're a group of people who hug problems that need to be solved, get indigestion even if they eat, and cough up when they drink tea. I hope you understand with a generous heart.\"\"No, I was only thinking about myself.\"Hyun Jong burst into laughter and looked at the merchants still.\"Let's get to the point without dragging our feet.\"\"Thank you.\"Gong Munyeon smiled lightly.\"I brought you here today, not only to convey the position of Hasan.\"\"If you were to put yourself in Hawasan's shoes?\"Hyun Jong slightly noticed Gong Munyeon.In the small movement, Gong Munyeon was able to figure out in advance what the next words would be.\"I've searched everywhere, but I haven't found anyone to lend money to Hawasan. In other words, I don't think I'll be able to pay you back within the due date.\"\"Hmmm.\"Gong Munyeon frowned at Hyun Jong's words.\"We've given you plenty of time. We have to earn money to become merchants. I can't delay the deadline again.\"\"That's why I'm saying it.\"Hyun Jong made eye contact with everyone and opened his mouth.\"I know I can't delay it any longer. But it's impossible for Hwasan to pay back 100,000 dollars on the day of reimbursement. So please.\"Hyun Jong leaned down and took the ticket.\"I can't pay all that money back, but I can pay some back. So if there's anyone here who can personally delay the repayment date, please help us with Hasan.\"Everyone was embarrassed and stared blankly at the fact that the long writer had lowered his head.The atmosphere began to flow strangely.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He carried the collapsing Moonpa on his back, but did not lose his gentleness and grace.Chung-Myung squinted and looked at the long writer.But that shouldn't be all.'Patience has proved enough. However, it is not only character and patience that a long writer must possess.Of course that's important. But Hwasan's...\u2026. No, there is something else that any writer who leads the Chinese literature must have.It's coldness.'That's the kind of place a long writer is.Even if it is where the Taoists live, the essence of Hawasan is Mufa.Regardless of his or her personality, he or she who leads the literary circle as a long-time writer must have a cool head. For the sake of Hawasan's film, you have to be able to trust yourself thoroughly to the benefit of the doubt.Does Hyun Jong have a mind to read as a long writer?Chung-Myung, lying on the eaves with his chin resting on him, raised his body slightly.Wood! Wood! Wood, wood!Then there is the sound of bone breaking in my back.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\"Chung-Myung, who made a groan, grabbed his waist and fell flat on the eaves again.'Oh, my God.'Perhaps because I'm properly drained, there's no place in my whole body that's fine. Even though he was constantly working and grooming, he didn't think about returning to his birthmark.In my head, I finished calculating that I could regain my original condition in one or three months, but it was a problem to endure three months. I'm so frustrated that I came into the body of a weak young man, but now I can't even use that weak body properly.\"Um... I'm going to have to come up with something.\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply and lifted his head.For now, his body is a later matter. We have to see how that situation ends.\"Did you ask me to delay the due date?\"Gong Munyeon frowned unconsciously.I thought there might be something. He never looked down on Hawasan's potential. Dozens of literary factions emerge and disappear every day. It's never easy to go on for hundreds of years in that exorcism.Now, Hawasan's situation is not as good as it used to be, but Moonpa, which has a long history, has that potential.But...\"Is this what you call the potential?'I can't stop laughing.Am I overestimating Hwasan too much?'Come to think of it, they wouldn't have been driven to this situation if they had left their potential. Gong Munyeon sighed deeply.\"I made it clear the other day that I can no longer delay the repayment date.\"\"Don't get me wrong. Bondo is not asking the princess right now.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes?\"Hyun Jong stared at Gong Munyeon and opened his mouth.\"I am fully aware of the position of the chord counterpart. That's why Bondo is only asking you all directly now. Even if it's 100,000 won, don't you have a separate amount to receive?\"\"That's true.\"\"So I'm asking you personally if there's anyone who can delay the repayment date.\"Gong Munyeon frowned.\"Thin numbers.\"I don't know what this means.\"So you're saying you can pay back those who can't afford to delay their repayment?\"\"That's right.\"\"Yes?\"Gong Munyeon opened his eyes wide.\"Hwasan may not be as good as he used to be, but it's not that there aren't very many people who give him a helping hand. I couldn't afford all 100,000, but I was able to afford some. So with your help, Hawasan won't lose the name. So please. For those of you who are looking after Hawasan today, we will surely repay him in his name.\"Once again, the man of letters has taken a swipe. His posture was low, but he felt confident.Seeing that, Gong Munyeon frowned unconsciously.\"What nonsense...\u2026.\"\"I know.\"Yujong San, who was watching the situation at that moment, cut Gong Munyeon's words and came in. It may not have been intended, but it was inevitable for Gong Munyeon, who suddenly stopped talking, to raise an eyebrow.\"If I delay the reimbursement, you'll be relieved?\"\"Yes, it is.\"\"Let's be honest.\"Yujong San continues to talk with a bitter face.\"We know that Hawasan might go under tomorrow right now, and we know that he's going to fail. By the way, if you're asking me to postpone the repayment date by believing in the words of a long-time writer, you're asking me to take the risk that I might not get the money.\"\"\u2026\u2026it is, so to speak.\"\"Does that make any sense?\"Gong Munyeon has put on a new complexion. It is true that Yujong San cut him off, but anyway he was saying something he couldn't because of his face. It's better for Yujong San to come forward.Normally, Yujong San would have soothed the situation at this point, but Gong Munyeon remained silent this time. Now we need to push the long-winded a little more.It's all over now.'On this occasion, Hawasan will end that long history.It may be bitter for those who watch that the Mufain Hawasan is crushed by the power of money, not the force of the Tamun faction, but it is also more meaningful.\"Failor.\"\"Yes, a man of long letters.\"\"What can I offer you, Bondo?\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes?\"Hyun Jong straightened his shoulders.A cool wind is blowing from somewhere. Hyun Jong smiles brightly in the wind.\"There's nothing left in Hawaii. Now all that remains in Hawasan is the honor of supporting the chords and islands for many years. The only thing I can call is Hwasan's name, too.\"\"Well\u2026\u2026.\"\"If you ask me what to believe, this is the only answer. The name of Hawasan. History of Hawasan. Is that not enough?\"Yujong San shut up if he had nothing to say.The name of Hawasan.History of Hawasan.Yeah, maybe it's a meaningful word. Unless the people gathered here are merchants.A name or history means nothing to a merchant. Money is the only thing that means to merchants. Does it make money or doesn't it make money? It's the merchants who put everything on that one.But you want the merchants to collateralize their names and history?\"Huh.\"Yujong San couldn't stop a burst of laughter.\"You're too stubborn, are you?\"\"Did you say forced?\"Hyun Jong still looked at Yujong San. The heavyness of his eyes forced Yujong San to withdraw unconsciously.\"Maybe it's forced.\"But unlike his heavy eyes, Hyun Jong's voice from his mouth was only soft.\"But I want to try and force myself. Because Hwasan believes that the name left by Hwasan, who has protected the island and harmony for hundreds of years, is not in vain.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I'd like to ask you backwards. What does wasan mean to you. Indeed, in the name of Hwasan, does not there exist such values in the history of Hwasan.\"No one could open their mouth.Hwasan.Who dares to call the name light? And who dares to waste that history?No one dares to belittle Hwasan's name, though it is now a name that has been faded away. Moreover, those who have lived with their roots in harmony will be even more so.Therefore, no one was willing to continue the conversation.Except for one person.\"I think it's a little off topic.\"Gong Munyeon set out to refresh the atmosphere. Hyun Jong's eyes are on Gong Munyeon. Unlike Hyun Jong's empty eyes, Gong Munyeon's eyes were as sharp as ever.\"In summary, if you're going to personally push back the repayment date, and if you don't, take the money here today.\"\"That's how it works.\"\"All right.\"Gong Munyeon nodded.\"Originally, in the name of the Union of Chords, it should be opposed, but I'm a man of providence, so I'll grant you permission. If anyone wants, you can postpone the reimbursement personally. One!\"Gong Munyeon looked back with sharp eyes.\"You have to take responsibility for that. The merchant association does not provide protection for those who delay the reimbursement date. Even if I'm being disbursed.\"It was a subtle pressure.\"You can choose. The person who will keep the reimbursement date is here. And if you think you're going to delay the reimbursement, go over there.\"Gong Munyeon's hand pointed to the side.\"Is this enough? A long writer?\"\"That's right.\"Hyun Jong nodded coolly.\"I don't know what this means. However, I will respect the opinion of the long writer until the end. Isn't it a respectable place to be a long-time writer of Hwasan, although it is now a disappearance?\"Hyun Jong grinned silently.\"Thank you for your concern.\"Gong Munyeon raised an eyebrow unconsciously. There is no change in Hyun Jong's attitude even though he made a sneak provocation.'I'll break your attitude.'Gong Munyeon, who took a moment, said with a quiver.\"How do you like it? Unfortunately, there is no one who can delay the repayment date?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Look.\"Gong Munyeon pointed back. Hyun Jong's eyes follow Gong Munyeon to merchants. Those who met Hyun Jong's eyes turned their eyes slightly and avoided their eyes.\"Do you need more time?\"Hyun Jong did not reply. I just closed my eyes.\"No matter how long you wait, it doesn't change. Because no one will give up a fortune because of the name of the faded Hawasan. So let's stop now, Jang Moon-in. Stand aside with all your might. You've done enough to be a long writer.\"Gong Munyeon, intoxicated with victory, opened his arms without realizing it.\"Now, with this...\u2026.\"\"Tsk.\"It was that moment.I can hear footsteps rattling behind my back. Gong Munyeon looked back without realizing it.\"\u2026\u2026Staff owner?\"Yujong San was trudging to the side with his face as if he had chewed something.It is the seat where those who will delay the repayment date will go.\"What the hell\u2026\u2026\"Yujong San sighed as he saw Gong Munyeon's speechless expression.\"\u2026\u2026look. What the hell are you thinking?\"Gong Munyeon's angry voice spread sharply everywhere.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because I know I'm doing a stupid thing.\"Yujong San shakes his hand as if he is annoyed.\"Why would someone you know?\"\"Hey, princess.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"You're not a harmonious man.\"Gong Munyeon's face went blank.What are you talking about?\"You're the son-in-law in the chords, so you don't know. What does wasan mean in harmony?\"\"No!\"Gong Munyeon poked his lips.What the hell are you talking about? Why is it important now if you're not a chord person?\"Hey, you're a shopkeeper.\"\"Oh, thank you. Because I know what you're trying to say.\"Yujong San sighed deeply.\"I understand that money seems to be the same way of saying harmony in a world where you sell it.\"Gong Munyeon looked at Yujong San with an absurd face. I wonder what the hell will come out of his mouth.\"But I'm a man of harmony.\"\"\u2026\u2026what did you do?\"\"Those who were born and raised in harmony grow up to hear stories about Hawasan. When you get out of the baby food, you have to live in the world and become a master of the world, and even after knowing that you are not talented enough to join the world, you grow up hearing how he has protected the world and the island.\"Gong Munyeon tilted his head. What is this out of the blue?\"Not just me. My father and my grandfather grew up like that. Hawasan is the pride of the islanders, the pride of harmony. And\u2026\u2026.\"Yujong San scratched the back of his head.\"If not me, it was also the pride of my father or my grandfather.\"\"\u2026\u2026so what did it do?\"\"But what if I take down Hwasan to make some money? Will my father leave me alone when I go to the next world? You'll be beaten for days and days.\"A low laugh burst out.When Gong Munyeon turned his head with a stiff face, everyone closed their mouths and lowered their heads slightly.\"So, for that reason, you're giving up a fortune?\"\"Giving up is nothing. I didn't hear that the long man would make it up to you?\"\"Do you believe that?\"\"There's nothing to believe. What are you going to do with the money?\"Yujong San spat on the floor.\"He's like you who's going to get paid and leave, and he's going to have a lot of money to use. If you go to Hangzhou, there are many places to spend money. But where am I going to make money? I've spent my whole life digging in harmony. Hangju? Soju? That's not funny.\"Yujong San smirked without realizing it.It's not even a funny situation. By the time he climbed Hawasan, he was so engrossed in the idea of getting money and living on his own. But aren't you saying this now?It's crazy.It's not something you can do in your right mind. Yujong San knew very well how stupid he was now.But...\"You'll regret it.\"\"Of course you'll regret it. God d*mn it! Look like I'm doing this because I don't know I'm sorry! I know better than you do! Of course you'll regret it!\"Yujong San shouted out loud.\"But it would be less uncomfortable than my hand destroying Hwasan!\"Gong Munyeon looks at Yujong San with dumbfounded eyes.Yujong San also sighed after taking a deep breath several times to see if the excitement did not subside.\"Hey, princess, I'm still worth a living. If I try to protect Hawasan here now, I'll lose money. Then you can live in poverty, just taking your money back then. But if I pull out the roots of Hawasan's pillars here, I'll live with useless money until the day I die. I don't want to live like that.\"Gong Munyeon stared at Yujong San and clenched his teeth.\"Are you out of your mind?\"I couldn't understand what Yujong San was saying. But...You don't have to understand.'If you want to enter the fire pit on your own, why are you trying to stop me? The absence of that one person does not change the situation.\"Do as you please. It won't make a difference without you.\"\"Who said we were one?\"Gong Munyeon's movement stopped suddenly. Then the head slowly turns. His slow-moving head seemed to tell how hot he was now.\"The Preface Master.\"Seo Moon-jong walked beside Yujong San.\"What are you doing?\"\"Can't you see?\"Gong Munyeon frowned.However, Seo Mun-jong was not the only one who came forward. Perhaps Yujong San's voice was the trigger, five of the twenty people who came up together went to Yujong San.\"Oh, my God.\"Gong Munyeon shook his head.\"Have you seen such pathetic men?'How can a man named a merchant make such a stupid choice? Well, that's why you're stuck in this countryside for f*ck's sake.'No, I don''Gong Munyeon's face, which was unable to hide his pathetic heart, quickly hardened carefully.'They would never have made that choice if it wasn't for the other wasan. I guess that's how much Hwasan's influence on harmony is still absolute.'If you're swayed by emotions, you can't make a proper judgment. Disrespecting the opponent is the last thing a merchant should do. It is right to think that the potential of Hawasan, whom he was so concerned about, has been exercised at this moment.Gong Munyeon looked at those who crossed the side. Everyone is regretting it, but they are wearing faces full of relief.'Silly things.'Pride in not abandoning Hasan until the end?That is meaningful only when Hawasan exists. Even if they put off the reimbursement date, Hawasan can't afford to pay the rest of the money back. They ended up spending a fortune on a moment's misjudgment.Gong Munyeon, who finished his judgment, asked calmly.\"Is there anyone else who thinks otherwise?\"The remaining merchants watched Hyun Jong and Gong Munyeon and turned away.\"The Long Man.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Gong Munyeon said with a gentle smile.\"I didn't know Hwasan's name was still so high. But I guess that's it. The rest of them have no intention of postponing the repayment date, so I want you to stop paying back the money we lent you.\"Hyun Jong smiled in vain. His eyes were on the merchants behind him, not Gong Munyeon.\"Isn't there really anyone else who can help him.\"\u2026\u2026.\"When the answer did not return, Hyun Jong nodded still.\"Then it's inevitable.\"\"The Long Man.\"\"Don't rush me. Princess.\"Gong Munyeon flinched.It was a low voice, but Hyun Jong's voice contained a force that he dared not resist.Yujong San, who stood separately on the side, and Hyun Jong, who looked around several merchants, smiled brightly.\"But it's enough to confirm that there are still people who are willing to be Hawasan. Doesn't that mean the world hasn't abandoned him yet?\"When Gong Munyeon couldn't do this or that, Hyun Jong raised his voice loudly.\"Unam!\"\"Yes, long-time man!\"\"Bring it!\"\"Yes.\"Unam bowed his head and walked somewhere at a quick pace. Gong Munyeon slightly frowned at the sight.\"Are you sure you're ready?'It can't be.Gong Munyeon didn't just play with his hands off. If anyone had lent that money to Hawasan, it would have been in Gong Munyeon's ears.So you're bluffing?No, that doesn't make sense either. Bluffing is when there's a background, doing it. But now there is no background in Hawasan, is there? It is not a situation that can be solved by bluffing.Unam returns before Gong Munyeon can organize his thoughts. I was alone when I went, but there were three people coming back.\"Is that a wise man?\"Considering the age of those who come with Unam, they seemed to be the elders of Hawasan. One of them had a big box in his hand.\"I've got it, sir.\"Hyun Jong pointed forward with a chin.\"Put it down.\"\"Yes.\"ChinThe crates are placed on the floor.Gong Munyeon looked up at the chest and looked up.\"This is\u2026\u2026?\"\"There is a fortune in it that I owe you. Check it out.\"\"\u2026\u2026did you say wealth now?\"\"Yes, it is.\"Gong Munyeon looked at the chest with suspicious eyes.You don't want to play with me.Hyun Jong, who he knows, is not the one to joke around in this situation. Does that mean there's really wealth in there?Various thoughts rushed into my mind, but now was not the time to think. What do you mean by thinking about a box right in front of you?Gong Munyeon approached the ark as if possessed. And slowly opened the lid.His eyes become thinner after checking the stuff inside.\"This is\u2026\u2026.\"Wealth?This book can't be a fortune, can it?\"Jang-in, are you kidding me?\"\"Can't you can't do that. I certainly gave you what you wanted.\"\"What is this?\"\"You'll know when you read it.\"Gong Munyeon, who saw Hyun Jong's calm face, bit his lips and pulled out one of the books in the chest. Then I started checking the contents on the stand.Go away.Go away.The sound of turning the pages spreads through the quiet Hawasan. Gong Munyeon's face was colored with dirt every time more pages were passed.\"This is\u2026\u2026.\"Gong Munyeon, whose face color has completely changed, looked at Hyun Jong shaking his hand holding the book.\"What is this...\u2026.\"When Gong Munyeon couldn't continue his words, merchants, who were wary of Gong Munyeon, sneaked toward Gong Munyeon.\"What's that? Princess?\"\"Let's take a look.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"When Gong Munyeon didn't answer, merchants glanced at the crates. Those who have confirmed that there are still several books left inside reach out and take them out.\"What the hell is this...\u2026.\"The faces of those who checked the contents with slightly nervous faces soon became suspicious.\"Isn't this a bookkeeper?\"\"That'sir.\"Hyun Jong nodded coolly.\"It's like an old book, why do you suddenly...\u2026?\"Hyun Jong smiled brightly.\"The books you're looking at are books that Hawasan's predecessor made for the management of the business.\"\"\u2026\u2026What? What the hell?\"Hyun Jong's eyes have subsided a little.\"Did you check, Princess?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hyun Jong's voice resonates clearly.\"The book proves that the originator of the chord business you're running now is Hwasan.\"\"Yes?\"\"Oh, no, what the hell does that mean? A long writer?\"\"Quiet.\"Hyun Jong resolutely cut them off. And he opened his mouth softly to those who had yet to come to their senses.\"Hwasan has done you a favor. But you have avenged your kindness. No matter how much Hawasan admires goodness, it's not a funny place to show favor to the rats who bite their owners without grace.\"The stern scolding of Hyun Jong is pouring out sharply.\"Hwasan, based on this account, will confiscate all of the businesses you run, as well as the assets you've collected so far.\"A bolt of lightning fell into the dry sky.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those who understood what Hyun Jong was saying could not shut up, and those who had yet to grasp the situation could not dare to open their mouths because they were weighed down by the atmosphere.\"Come on, Long Writers!\"\"What do you mean? A long writer?\"The disturbance broke out rapidly.Merchants who dyed their faces red screamed as if they were evil, but Hyun Jong didn't change a single expression. A cold face that has not been seen in him usually weighs on merchants.\"Literally.\"\"Ha, but...\u2026!\"\"We don't know what the hell this is about.\u2026.\"It was then.\"Quiet.\"Gong Munyeon's cold voice closed the merchants' mouths.Hyun Jong and Gong Munyeon's eyes are intertwined in Ho Gong.\"The Long Man.\"\"Say it, princess.\"Attitudes have not changed, but much has changed. Hyun Jong was no longer consistent in a relaxed manner, and the tenderness he had walked politely in the complexion of Gong Munyeon disappeared.\"I think you're being too mischievous.\"\"Did you say it was a joke?\"\"That's right.\"The eyes of the two are intertwined in Ho Gong. Hyun Jong, who would normally have been soft, has not stepped down at this moment.\"I'm sorry if the seat of great Hawasan seems to be free enough to share your farm with you.\"Gong Munyeon closes his mouth tightly. His mouth cracks as usual.\"Certainly, according to this account, most of the businesses in the Harmon Merchants Union are owned by Hawasan. If we fail to provide proof that we have taken over the business at a fair price, we will have nothing to say if we confiscate our property.\"\"You're well aware.\"\"One.\"Gong Munyeon smiled. But the smile was distinctly different from the one he had ever shown. It's an awkward smile as if it was forced to make it up.\"Isn't that the story of when this book was real?\"Hyun Jong stared at Gong Munyeon without saying a word. But Gong Munyeon continued to speak without being pressed by those eyes.\"How do you prove whether or not this book that popped out of nowhere is genuine?\"\"That means\u2026\u2026.\"Hyun Jong opened his eyes wide.\"Is it the only way to say that Hawasan has now given false evidence.\"\"Hwasan wouldn't do that.\"Gong Munyeon took a step back. But that didn't change the attitude.\"But isn't it possible that Hawasan is also being deceived by this false account? We can't trust this book unless it's verified as authentic.\"\"That's right!\"\"What a common sense!\"The merchants were right, bolstered by Gong Munyeon's comments.Hyun Jong, who was watching the scene, nods slowly. Then I turned my head and looked at Hyun Young.\"Jaegyeong Footnote.\"\"Yes, sir!\"\"What do you think?\"\"They have a point.\"Hyun Young, the financial footnote, answered without changing his face. The figure brought joy to the merchants.\"What should I do?\"\"The long story is wrong.\"\"Hmm?\"Hyun Young says with a big smile.\"It's not our job to determine whether the books are genuine or not. Isn't it the government office that makes a difference between a situation like this?\"\"Right.\"Hyun Young went on with a lot of tickets.\"That's why we've already left half of our books at the government office of Chords to verify that it's authentic. If the books are authentic, the government will personally confiscate their businesses.\"Gong Munyeon opened his eyes wide.\"Did you say you've already left it to me?\"\"Yes. Why? What's wrong?\"Hyun Young's nonchalant response lowers Gong Munyeon's body temperature. A cold sweat began to seep out of my spine.'I got you.'If they were in harmony, they could cope. But they are now in Wasan. If government soldiers flocked to the workplace and began occupying them while they were away, the remaining would have no way to deal with it.'That's him!'There was a spark in Gong Munyeon's eyes staring at Hyun Jong.Hyun Jong brought them together to Wasan with this intention from the beginning. Showing the accounts directly to merchants and covering up disputes was nothing but blindfolding. What they really aim for is to keep them out of harmony.\"When did you put the books in the coffin?\"\"It was two days ago.\"\"\u2026\u2026ee.\"Gong Munyeon grinds his teeth.Two days is more than enough time to verify all the books. He said he left half of it, but the books are half-contrastable. It was clear that the books in the chest had already been reviewed.In other words, at the bottom of the mountain, government troops were already waiting to cover the authenticity of the books and prepare to confiscate the business.Chords' coffins are generations of Hawaiian friendly places. If the long-winded man used Hawasan's connections to pressure from above, isn't it obvious how the chords will turn out?It's probably going to be a mess by now.\"Long man!\"An angry voice burst out of Gong Munyeon's mouth.But Hyun Jong was no longer the generous man he knew.\"Keep your voice down.\"A stern spirit emanates from Hyun Jong's predecessor. Although Gong Munyeon is rarely surprised or embarrassed by people, he had no choice but to cringe at the energy emanating from Hyun Jong.The name was Hwasan.It was unimaginable that the spirit was emitted from the man who carried the name, which now had nothing but nothing left.\"You have no right to speak.\"Hyun Jong stares at merchants with cold eyes. Some, unable to overcome the weight of that gaze, shook their heads and avoided the eyes of Hyun Jong.\"True friends are those who reach out when they're in trouble. You don't have to treat people with knives when they're having a hard time. Go back, go down to the chords and everything will be over. If it were the way it was, I'd have to retrieve everything from you.\u2026.\"Hyun Jong sighed.\"You can't ignore all the hard work you've done. So I'll grant you permission to take a cartload of wealth.\"\"Now, the long-winded man.\"No matter how tactless they were, they couldn't help but notice how the situation was going at this point.\"I have done you the greatest favor.\"At that time, Hyun Young, the finance footnote, opened his mouth.\"These are the people who have destroyed Hawasan and siphoned off his wealth. In addition, he tried to avenge Hwasan's kindness. Such a favor to those people...\u2026.\"\"The beast tried to bite. So, if you show your teeth together, I'll be an animal, too.\"Hyun Jong shook his hand.\"I've already decided, so please don't mention it any more.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"Hyun Young lowered his head.\"Get down, please. Don't you want to see what's going on with your eyes?\"Gong Munyeon's face is completely distorted. Revealing his teeth, he glared at Hyun Jong as if to kill him.\"Long man, you were hiding your mind behind that soft face.\"\"Reading mind...\"Hyun Jong smiled brightly.\"Totally, I suppose. I can't compare to you.\"\"\u2026\u2026I won't forget this debt.\"\"Come on, Unam, take them.\"\"Yes, long-time man!\"Gong Munyeon turned his body around. Then, without waiting for Unam's guidance, he began to walk toward the mountain gate.The merchants, who were at their wits' end, rushed to follow Gong Munyeon. You should go down the mountain as soon as possible to see what happened to the harmony.Hyun Jong sighed softly as he looked at the merchants heading to the prose.\"Jang In! Thank you for your hard work.\"\"Cancer.\"Hyun Jong smiled softly at Hyun Young.\"I'm done with wasan. Don't worry about that!\"\"Don't be so upset. Now we've crossed a mountain.\"\"Where was the mountain bigger than that? Everything will be fine now.\"Hyun Jong smiled at Hyun Young, who was so excited and lost what to do.It has been decades since I saw a financial footnote like that. Everyone was carrying a heavy burden on their shoulders.It's all thanks to him.'I think it's Hwasan's Hongbok.We need to give a big prize, but what prize should we give to celebrate all of this? I keep laughing.Hyun Jong's eyes, which had been lost in thought for a while, turned to Yujong San and the rest of the merchants.\"And\u2026\u2026.\"Those who saw the eyes of a long writer immediately bow their heads.\"You have not lost your grace to the last.\"Hyun Jong's attitude was quite different from that of other merchants a while ago. It's certainly soft, though not without its severity.\"We don't know what's going on.\u2026.\"\"It doesn't change the fact that your place of business belongs to Hawasan. Of course, Hwasan's should be returned to him. However, I will continue to allow you to run your businesses and get paid for it.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yujong San's face became subtle.Although the situation is better than those who are rushing down the mountain right now, it is the same to lose their workplaces. Wouldn't Yujong San become an agent in the store owner of the store?\"If you do...\"As soon as Yujong San tried to protest, Hyun Young opened his mouth.\"Too much greed can cause anger.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"It's a sin to pressure others with property that doesn't belong to them. Hawasan just gave you a chance to take the weight off your sins.\"A sigh is coming out.Hyun Young is right if all this comes from a fake.\"Grandpa, what the hell have you done?'I'm suddenly ashamed.\"Jaegyeong Footnote.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Isn't it true that they didn't betray their loyalty to Hwasan and helped him at the last minute?\"\"You're right.\"\"Let's discuss it together. Let's see if there's a good direction. Shouldn't Hawasan still be a warm place for a close friend?\"\"Yes, a man of letters. I'll obey your instructions.\"Hyun Young sneaked forward and gestured to merchants.\"Come this way. Let's go to the finance ministry and discuss what's ahead.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes.\"Merchants walked along with Hyun Young. There was a complex feeling on his face.While everyone was moving away, Hyun Jong remained alone and looked around Hwasan.There was not a day when I didn't see this sight. But Hawasan, who caught his eye today, was clearly different from yesterday.The stark, faded halls seem to be full of life today.'Is everything on your mind?'No, it doesn't just end like that.This is the first time in decades that Hawasan, who has always been exposed to sad news, has received it. The flow has a strange side, so once you change the direction, it's not easy for you to turn it around with your workforce.Now that the water has opened in the right direction, Hawasan will be different from before. Hyun Jong believed so.Perhaps today will bring back the forgotten glory of Hawasan.'That's the way it should be.'A clear, waterless smile bloomed on Hyun Jong's face full of wrinkles.\"\u2026\u2026I, I\u2026\u2026.\"And a clear, wrinkle-free face crumpled up.\"That sucker!\"There is a spark in Chung-Myung's eyes.What? A cart?What's wrong with animals?\"Hi, I'll show you exactly what an animal is!\"Hyun Jong sent them there.Chung-Myung did not let them go.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Didn't you hear that?\"\"There's nothing you can't hear because you have ears.\"Jo-Gol made more of a fuss when Yoon-Jong replied nonchalantly.\"It turns out that the harmonious merchants who were pressing for debt to Hawasan were his agents in the past. Their businesses are all owned by Hwasan.\"\"I see.\"\"The chords are crazy right now. Government soldiers are occupying the chords and confiscating all of their property.\"\"I heard that, too.\"\"Oh, my God, Ambassador! Why are you so calm? Ha! This is why I shouldn't talk to people who are going to be masters!\"Jo-Gol struck in the chest as if he was frustrated.\"Is that such a big deal?\"\"It's amazing. It's amazing. Do you have any idea how much it would cost to confiscate all the assets of the flock? Apart from their wealth, if they can only bring their own businesses, Hawasan won't have to worry about making ends meet for generations.\"\"So... ..?\"Yoon-jong looked at Jo-Gol with new eyes as if he knew it was a little serious.He is a man who will become a doer in the first place, and is far from a natural counterpart. There seems to be a clear difference between his view of the incident and Jo-Gol's view of the shopping district.\"It must have been bigger than I thought.\"\"Oh, my God, the death penalty. The death penalty should lead Hawasan in the future, and it would be a disaster if he had no sense of money.\"\"Well, keep that in mind.\"I've heard rumors, but I've never thought it was such a big deal. I just thought I could get away with the debt crunch, but it seems to be quite a big deal.As a result, a new question arose.\"But how did this happen all of a sudden? Why did you put up with the humiliation so far?\"\"Well, that's....\"\"Huh?\"Jo-Gol's face has become strangely complex.\"I heard they found the books this time.\"\"Books?\"\"Yes, the books related to the business of Hawasan. They found it a few days ago and they were able to knock them down...\u2026.\"Jo-Gol obliquely blurs the end of the story. And Yoon-jong could see why Jo-Gol's expression was so sour.\"A few days ago.\"\"Yes.\"\"The books were found a few days ago. And the books must be in the form of a book?\"\"I suppose so.\"Yoon-Jong laughed bitterly.\"It just so happens that we saw a book found a few days ago. Don't you think so?\"\"\u2026\u2026yes.\"Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong couldn't keep up their words and exchanged subtle glances.'The ark.''There must have been a book in it.'It's too coincidental to call it a coincidence. In addition, wasn't the response of the long writer who checked the contents of the ark so impressive?\"I don't think so.\"\"I feel the same way.\"Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong's faces got a little darker.\"In addition, his reaction before that was a little...\u2026.\"\"It was obviously so strange.\"- Oh my god! What's this? What's with the stone?- No, my God! It's not a stone! Who buried this in a place like this? That's weird. Hahaha. That's weird.Shall we dig? You don't mind if I dig? Hahahaha. Haha. I can't believe this is buried here. What a strange thing to do. I don't think it's a treasure.Yoon-jong closed his eyes tightly.'If you try to fool me, I'll try to fool you. God d*mn it.'I can't forget that awkward voice. Even if a three-year-old child hears it, it's definitely...'Oh, he's making some strange move.'I would have thought.The crumbles that came after that crappy performance...\u2026.\"As expected?\"\"Right?\"Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong's faces became serious.\"Where the hell did they find it?\"\"\u2026\u2026the more I know, the more I don't know.\"\"Yes.\"Yoon-jong shakes his head.There are so many suspicions. Even if you don't try hard, every time you walk, suspicious things seem to roll down.Nevertheless, the reason why Yoon-jong is not so wary of Chung-Myung is that his sincerity towards Hwasan is obvious.The same is true of this work. Anyway, didn't Hwasan benefit greatly from Chung-Myung's search for the books?\"Anyway\u2026\u2026.\"It was that moment.\"Metabolism!\"A loud voice came from outside the room.\"What's going on?\"\"Haven't you seen Chung-Myung?\"\"Why Chung-Myung?\"\"I can't see where he is even when he's looking for me. It's not in the room.\"\"\u2026\u2026Hmm?\"Yoon-jong's body, which was trying to answer casually, stopped. Soon his complexion begins to turn black.\"You don'sorry.\"Yes, anywhere.\"\"Stop, don't tell me!\"Yoon-jong jumped up from his seat. Then he rushed to run towards Chung-Myung's room.Yoon-jong, who slammed into the door, opened Chung-Myung's closet.\"What's wrong with you?\"Jo-Gol, who rushed into the room after Yoon-Jong belatedly, shouted.\"\u2026\u2026none.\"\"Yes?\"\"I don't have it.\"Yoon-jong pointed to an empty closet. Inside the closet was Chung-Myung's uniform.\"Huh? Take off the application. Where are you kidding me?\u2026.\"At that moment Jo-Gol's eyes were as bright as a lamp.Taking off one's coat means wearing another. However, casual clothes are also placed next to the uniform. Invisible clothes are like...\u2026.\"Stop, don't tell me.\"It's night happiness and mask that Jo-Gol brought me a while ago.Yoon-jong's face was distorted mercilessly.\"What kind of accident are you going to do again?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung was truly two people who couldn't tell if it was a Hongbok or a disaster.* * *\"Huh....\"A little bit of people looked at the cart with a mesmerized face. The cart contained some of the wealth he had collected so far.Full of wealth that's about to fall.It's a surprising amount if someone you don't know saw it, but the feeling of a few people looking at the wealth was terrible.\"In one day\u2026\u2026.\"There was no such thing as a bolt out of the blue.What they saw as they scurried down from Hawasan was their workplaces already occupied by government forces. Arms-armed government soldiers surrounded the workplace, and they were ordered into exile.The only thing they returned to protesting was the rant that they would have all been sent to the government office without the request of a long-time writer, Hwasan.What the hell is going on?'That means the books were real.However, some people were forced to feel unfair. Who would have imagined that the Plum Blossom Workshop, which had been run by the family generation, belonged to Hwasan? I just took over because I was running it in my predecessor's office.But I was robbed of the workshop overnight and kicked out of the harmony. Where else in the world is this unfair?Others' expressions were also dark.When I saw the carts that began to gather one by one, a few people were heartbroken their hearts.\"\u2026\u2026what the hell is going on here?\"\"That's not true.\"Sighs came from all over the place.They're kicked out of the chords right now, but the Sixers are allowed to stay a little longer. Now, no matter whether it is porridge or rice, we have no choice but to leave the harmony with the six leaders.\"Do you really have to leave like this?\"\"Then what do we do?\"\"At least protest...\u2026.\"\"Protest?\"Jin Yi-san of the Hwayeong Guest Cup glared at some people with killer eyes.\"You said that when you saw the supermarket owner protesting and being dragged to the government office? We are con artists, con artists! Except that if the long writer didn't show mercy, he wouldn't have left now, but he would have been locked up in prison! But what do you mean, how do you argue?\"The shoulders of a few people drooped.\"Oh, my God!\"Jin Yi-san turned nervously.\"Let's go!\"\"Bur, already?\"\"I didn't hear you say you'd be locked up in prison if you didn't leave the city. Let's get out of the harmonies!\"In the end, a few nodded helplessly. Those who were watching followed a few people who went ahead with dark faces.It took them a long time to get out of the chords. With a brief pull in the shade of the tree, they trudged down from the cart and gathered.\"\u2026\u2026that should be enough.\"\"I think the government soldiers who have been watching from behind have returned. Don't you think you can relax now?\"\"You have to be relieved.\"\"What do we do now?\"When I get out of the emergency situation, other things start to show up.A little bit of people turned their heads and looked at Gong Munyeon. Seeing him who hasn't said a word since a while ago makes me feel sick.\"Princess Rouge!\"The voice sticks out sharply.\"What am I supposed to do now?\"When a few people opened the door, others began to blame Gong Munyeon.\"Say something!\"\"Didn't you say all you had to do was trust the princess? What's going on?\"\"I believed in the princess, and now I'm a con artist. How are you going to take responsibility for this?\"Gong Munyeon slowly raised his head.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Everyone who saw his eyes closed their mouths. Gong Munyeon's eyes, which have always been as soft as Gunja, are glistening with life.\"Did you blame me now?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Those who were pushed by Gong Munyeon's momentum unknowingly backed down.\"Oh, no, I didn't mean...\u2026.\"\"I mean, let's come up with a plan. The countermeasures... ...\"Gong Munyeon, who overwhelmed the crowd when everyone flinched, raised the momentum even more.\"What a pathetic bunch of people.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Gong Munyeon works coldly.\"Hwasan and Chuck didn't start anyway! Is there one of you who is shameless? I'm sure you all knew about it.\"There was no answer.Still, those who knew the shame bowed their heads with dark faces, but most did not.Gong Munyeon said, deflating a little.\"No need to make a fuss. Because now I'm just avoiding the rain. It will never end like this.\"\"\u2026\u2026what are you going to do?\"\"How can that account be real?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"It's obviously a forged account.\"\"Ha, at Hana government office...\u2026.\"\"If you're right with the wise man, it's no big deal to manipulate the authenticity of the books. You've decided to share your wealth with the wise man!\"\"Ah!\"Merchants raised their heads.\"Then?\"\"Let's go to Nakyang for now. If you go to Nakyang, you can try. If they're going to push people with power, they're going to have more power! I will surely punish those wicked wise men and the long-standing men of Hawasan!\"\"Oh!\"\"Of course it is! It doesn't make sense to have a book from a hundred years ago all of a sudden!\"\"I have to reveal the tricks of those crooks!\"The voices of the merchants grew louder.But I'm thinking about something else in my head.It doesn't matter if that book is real or fake. As Gong Munyeon said, if the power of power is available, real books can be fake.Then it's no big deal to get your property back.Gong Munyeon snorted at the changed response.\"So you have nothing to worry about. I'll take care of everything, so just trust me and follow me.\"\"We only believe in rouge!\"\"I believed it from the beginning! Of course.\"'Pathetic things.'Gong Munyeon frowned.It's like a bug, but we still need these guys. It's better to have people who speak out together than alone. Once we lead them to Nakyang, we can reverse the situation. A backbencher who can give him definite power...\u2026.\"You're f*cking it.\"Then, a strange voice flew in.Gong Munyeon's head turned away.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But there was a man standing just around the corner.Who is it?Gong Munyeon's feelings of finding the owner of the voice turned from embarrassment to embarrassment.Black night happiness, black mask, and a sword in one hand.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Anyone can tell that I'm a robber.But...Gong Munyeon's eyes went up without realizing it. The blazing sun catches his eye.\"Are you crazy?\"Robber walking around the boulevard in broad daylight. Does this make any sense?\"\u2026\u2026what you said?\"Someone asked the question of Gong Munyeon instead. Then the masked man looks at the speaker with a sour eye.\"Here's my horse\u2026\u2026Coughing! Coughing! Turn it off. Who else is there besides me...\u2026cough! Me?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Gong Munyeon looked at the robber with blank eyes.\"I think I'm about to die.'Is he an old man?Bendable waist. His body is like a skeleton. And the complexion of the eyes revealed between the masks presumably makes you look quite old.Or a dying little boy.No, but that can't be true.\"What business? I don't think it's a passerby.\"Then the masked man coughed a few times and shook his head.\"Yes, I'm going to die.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Can't you see what's\"\"\u2026\u2026I don't know?\"\"Who do you think is this guy walking around in broad daylight?\"\"Crazy guy?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026or dementia?\"\"Robber! Robber!\"\"Oh, you were a robber. I didn't think so.\"Gong Munyeon stopped smirking.Robber with a look like he can't even catch a rat.Of course, you should not underestimate others just by looking at them. But now the author's appearance wasn't the only problem.Although he holds the sword tightly, I can't feel the unique spirit of Kang Ho-in, who has mastered martial arts.A thoughtful Kang Ho-in wouldn't walk around in that outfit in broad daylight. It's something you can't do without being crazy.\"Hey, old man.\"Gong Munyeon shook his hand like a fly.\"It looks like you've lost your way at the sight of wealth, but don't give up your life and go back.\"\"When you see wealth...\u2026Coughing! The sashimi is...\u2026. Cough! Cough! Ow! It's your people!\"\"\u2026\u2026I don't understand what you're saying?\"\"Yes.\"As the English was not delivered, the masked man tapped his waist a couple of times and pointed to Gong Munyeon with a sword he was holding as a cane.\"I'm not trying to take away my wealth, I'm trying to find my property.\"\"You said it was a robbery a little while ago.\"\"You have to understand me like hell with it.\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh.\"Gong Munyeon made an impression.Things are not going to work out, so all the weirdos get stuck.\"You'd better get out of here before you hit the view.\"\"Do you want to try it.\"This guy is real!\"As soon as Gong Munyeon tried to scream, the end of the masked sword pointed at Gong Munyeon.\"I didn't think you were a bad brainer, but you don't understand what I'm saying.\"Gong Munyeon shut up.There was a moment of silence.Gong Munyeon, who had been looking at the masked man for a long time, asked in a slightly different tone.\"Are you from Hawaii?\"Merchants opened their eyes wide at Gong Munyeon's words.\"Hwasan.\"\"What do you mean, princess?\"Gong Munyeon did not answer merchants' questions. It's not important to deal with the annoying flock of flies.The masked man is picking up his head.\"You know very well.\"\"I understand you're done talking to Hwasan?\"\"I'm done talking to Hawasan. But the story is not over with me.\"\"Did he send it to you?\"\"Do you think he is?\"\"\u2026\u2026I don't think so.\"Gong Munyeon had his own recognition of the long-written Huasan Hyun Jong. There is no denying that he is a stuffy person, but he keeps his own justice as much as he is frustrated.He was not worn out enough to let others go even though he said he would let them go in front of him.\"Does this man from Hawasan violate the long will of Hawasan?\"\"It's all right.\"The masked man turned his head.\"It's not an allocation for me to listen to him one by one.\"Gong Munyeon's face turned dark.\"The convention?\"The author is quite an old man, considering his bent waist, skinny body, and old voice, although he was masked.And considering the tone of the word \"Hwasan\", it could be a distribution of more than \"long-term people\".Which means that whoever is in front of him now may be the former master of Hawasan.But I don't see any signs of a master.'I don't know how far to believe. Gong Munyeon was usually calm in front of him, but the person in front of him now had no place for weirdness.Gong Munyeon has a firm complexion.\"I didn't know Hawasan's event would be so petty.\"\"Chizol?\"The masked man snorted.\"That's why black-haired beasts don't reap. What would the senior citizen say when he sees you now?\"\"\u2026\u2026who is your seniority?\"The masked Chung-Myung's eyes narrowed.\"Oh, look at this.'You don't know what seniority is?Chung-Myung was a rouge in Taehwaru when he was in Wasan. If Gong Munyeon continued Taehwa-ru, it would be hard not to know.But you don't know seniority?Chung-Myung tilted his head.I can smell it.'It also smells very bad. Maybe this hasn't been done by a few money-crazed people.\"Well, that's fine.\"Chung-Myung nodded his sword.\"I don't know if the long-time writer told you to take the wealth because he likes people, but I can't see it because he's very petty and learned nothing. I'd like to break my leg if I have a temper, but I still have to respect it because it's the order of a long-time writer. Leave the cart and get out of here. Then I won't catch you.\"\"Huh.\"Gong Munyeon burst into laughter.\"Hey, do you think I'm powerless to step down?\"\"Yes.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Gong Munyeon was speechless because he was embarrassed.It's a little weird talking about him. I keep getting speechless while talking.\"Well, you're mistaken. I stepped down so as not to cause a big problem. It's not because I couldn't catch a guy wearing a mask and robbing.\"\"Haha, you're a good talker.\u2026! Cough! Cough! Ehhhaha! Ack! Spit! Oh my...\u2026. Oh, my God.\"Seeing a masked man bent down and coughed, I felt sorry for him. If he had allowed the situation, he might have rushed to help him.Looking at my shaky arms and legs and bent back, I feel like crying.\"\u2026\u2026old man, if I could go back now, I wouldn't bother to catch you. You look tired, don't stand up and go.\"\"The old man freezes to death.\"She's a very young child.Although I'm taking a break now.\"Oh, my God, you're a man of birth.'The body was out of its mind. I had no choice but to use birth control, but I didn't know that the lungs would be this severe.How can he be fine as he is wandering all over the neighborhood in a situation where he has to live in Jeongyang for three months? I'm glad they misunderstood me as an old man, but...\u2026.\"Not much to say.\"Chung-Myung swings the sword.\"Only the ones who will be beaten up and left, and the ones who will go, go now. I would have beaten it up without asking or arguing in the past, but I've felt something recently, so don't touch my temper.\"\"You're a good talker.\"Gong Munyeon also drew the line as if there was no need to talk anymore.\"Last warning. I won't let this side take any chances anymore.\"\"Okay, tell them to come out back there.\"Gong Munyeon was stunned.\"Did you notice?\"Now there was a dark escort behind him. They're so talented that it's hard for most people to even notice.\"Come out.\"As soon as Gong Munyeon's name fell, a dozen warriors ran out of the grass.\"Huh?\"\"When did these people happen?\"Unimaginable merchants stick close to the cart with frightened faces. Of course they wouldn't have noticed.\"Once more!\"Argh! Argh!Still, Gong Munyeon's silence, which tried to give him one more chance to step down to respect the elderly, was a striking sound that would not be heard in his dream.I automatically move my shoulders to see how sticky the sound is.And...Down.The warrior who stood out the most collapsed. It seems wrong to get up again because the slightly lifted legs are shaking.Chung-Myung kicked his tongue and lifted the sword.\"Anyway!\"Argh! Argh!\"These days, kids!\"Argh! Argh!\"You talk a lot!\"Argh! Argh!\"It wasn't like that back in my day!\"Flop!Five warriors fell to the floor at a time when they couldn't figure out what was what. I can't understand the situation even by looking at it.\"Tsk.\"Chung-Myung, who recovered the sword from the search, put it on his shoulder. Then, he stares at Gong Munyeon with his one-legged.It might have been a pretty good scene if another burly man had done it. However, when Chung-Myung, who is bent down in a shallow manner, took such a position, he felt a sense of misery that he could not see with his eyes open his eyes.\"Baby.\"Chung-Myung says with a smirk.\"I don't think you know much, but none of the children who ignored me from the old days had their arms and legs back intact. If we can't communicate, we're animals. The hawk is the medicine for the beast. Let's see if the drug works for you, too.\"Chung-Myung walked with the sword on his shoulder.The warriors who saw it falter back. It is completely suppressed by the spirit.\"Stand back, you useless things.\"Gong Munyeon, who was bitten by the warriors behind, gritted his teeth and stepped forward.You mean there was still a man like this in Hawasan?'I thought it was a tiger whose teeth and nails were all pulled out. No, that would be right. If there was a mistake, it would have been overlooked that an animal called a tiger could kill a man with only its front feet without teeth and nails.\"I don't know why people like you are out of doors. Had he come to the fore, Hwasan wouldn't be like this.\"What do you know?Just as Chung-Myung was about to open his mouth, Gong Munyeon beat him with a sharp voice.\"One, I've chosen the wrong time. I wanted to punch Hawasan anyway, that's good. I'd be sad if someone your size would die in my hands. Be prepared.\"Gong Munyeon lifted his spirits.The surrounding grass rises up on the roof of Gong Munyeon. It was not the spirit to dare to see the owner of a guest cup in a prefecture.\"Yes, I thought you might have something.\"Chung-Myung shined his eyes.\"Don't worry. I'm not going to poke your mouth.\"Don't you think that's the way to talk?Chung-Myung swirled to Gong Munyeon. At that moment, Gong Munyeon ran toward Chung-Myung with both hands raised.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those who walk the path of martial arts should not underestimate their opponents. Tigers don't do their best when they catch rabbits.Moreover, there could not be any carelessness as long as the masked man saw how many days he defeated the guards.But...It's a little weird.purpleChinEven before the fist stretched forward, it was blocked at the edge of the chest. That's also after searching.If they try to crack down on the detection line, they are already completely gone. The history that had been raised to the fullest is twisted without finding a way out.\"Gasp!\"I can feel the sense of refluxing my skills clearly.\"Hey, this guy!\"He hit a masked man with the trick of retiring from the line, but there was no masked man on the spot already.\"Slowly exploding.\"\"Gasp!\"Gong Munyeon was surprised by the voice from behind and scrawled his fist back.But the same is true this time.My chin!\"Ugh!\"The force drawn from the danjeon should be amplified through the waist and chest and fired using arms and fists as launch pads. But what happens if the launch pad is blocked the moment you start?Boom!I can hear something popping in my body. At the same time, the area near the shoulder area swelled sharply.I can't see it with my eyes, but maybe my shoulder muscles burst out.\"Gain!\"And the same thing over and over again.\"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\"Pull up the air power as much as you can and kick the masked man. However, masked people did not seem to avoid it. Just one step back like a nuisance to a flying fly.Gong Munyeon's feet passed by the masked man's chest. The wind pressure shook the nightlife, but the masked man couldn't touch a hair.What kind of harmony is this?'I couldn't get my act together.Is it fast?No.Is it strong?That's not true either.The masked man was never fast or strong. In terms of appearance alone, Gong Munyeon can deal with 10 more masked people.But now Gong Munyeon couldn't even grab the hem of the masked man's clothes. As if a young disciple is dealing with a teacher, he tries all kinds of things, but no water works.Look at it now.His blow filled with games flies to the face of a masked man. Just by brushing, the flesh will be torn off, and the bones will be crushed. But I can't even touch it.The masked man completely destroys his attack just by turning his head slowly, as if he were avoiding the gestures of a three-year-old child.How can this be possible?It's not fast.But it's fast.It was never an overwhelming feeling to move at an invisible rate. But at a slow but definite and perfect moment it moves in the most appropriate direction and distance.A motion without any waste.It was the dream of any manless man. However, Gong Munyeon's heart was truly devastating to face the dreamy state right in front of him.It's like seeing a goblin.I'm obviously tangled with people, and I don't feel like I'm dealing with anyone at all. I can't even touch it in plain sight, and no matter how evil I try, I can't touch it.If you move your eyes so that they can turn, you will know the limit and level at once, but you will get sick because you miss it by just one sheet of paper.This guy is a monster.'I wouldn't be so nervous if I just avoided it. But that wasn't all this guy's math.'I'm reading all my books.'Even before the volume reaches out, it preempts the place where the volume will reach out. It was refluxing it by binding on the history it had to hit.It is different from shamanism. This was a phenomenal combination of pleasure and goodness.I don't even know how strong it is.It's wrong from the start.'A monster is a monster because it is unpredictable. Had I known there was a monster this big in Hwasan, I would never have made a move on him.By the way...\"Turn it off.\"A masked man, who was sneaking away from Gong Munyeon's attack, bends over his waist.\"Oh, my god, the body. I'm going to have a stiff neck.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The masked man gasped and tapped his waist.\u2026...something is a little clumsy for a monster.A master as big as that is, he's exhausted from this movement.That's absurd.But it was actually happening.The chest of a masked man goes up and down constantly. The mouth of the mask was slowly getting wet with exhaled breath. And the face exposed in the middle of the mask was full of sweat. The back is already wet with a lot of sweat dripping down the neck.Isn't it obvious you're on the verge of collapse?In the meantime, all the attacks were avoided, making it even crazier and more exciting.\"Yes.\"The masked man straightens his back again.\"Tsk. I'd like to hang out with you more, but I can't. I don't have enough energy.\"Gong Munyeon's face was filled with tension.A cup of tea hung out during the cooling down time, but in the end he couldn't even grab the masked man's clothes. Isn't it Gong Munyeon who was confident that if he could show all his abilities, there wouldn't be many people who could beat him even in Hawaii?But for the first time in my life, I was being played by an old man.\"How come people like you haven't come to the forefront in a while?\"\"You know what.\"Chung-Myung swung the sword and grabbed it again.\"Those who live in the middle of nowhere are under a strange illusion. Do I have to answer if you ask?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I'm the one who's going to ask. You're a very strong fighter for a resident. A man of this much merit lives off the chords?\"\"\u2026\u2026is there a law against running a base if the ball is strong?\"\"No, but it's not the same story if a strong runner wants money and plays tricks on him. If it's this big, you don't have to run a base to earn a lot of course. But you're running around dealing with drunk people?\"Chung-Myung's masked mouth wriggled.\"What are you talking about...\u2026.\"\"Oh, no, thanks.Chung-Myung cut off Gong Munyeon's words.\"I know, I know. You're not going to tell me anyway. There was no conspiracy, no tricks. So don't catch a raw person. I've never received anyone's name, and I don't have anything to do with anyone. All this work I personally started. Don't that right?\"\"\u2026\u2026well, yes.\"\"Oh, yeah, I am.\"Chung-Myung nodded loudly.\"That's what they usually say. And unfortunately, those who say that don't come clean with my own mouth without giving up an early death. But the truth is, your sins are great, but not big enough for me to grind you down. If I could think of it, I'd like to hear the right words separately from bones and flesh, but that would cause problems.\"Chung-Myung nodded to himself.\"Well, here's the problem. Do you know what I do when I'm like this?\"\"\u2026\u2026how can I know that.\"\"Lost.\"Gong Munyeon's eyes are slightly bigger.\"Yes?\"\"I'm going to beat you up.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung turned his head a couple of times and approached Gong Munyeon.\"Hold on to the one who won't talk anyway and speak. What do I do will only blow my mind. So you can simply compromise with each other. Don't you ever say it. I'm going to beat you until you think you're feeling better even if you don't talk.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"If you change your mind in the middle and want to talk, raise your hand and talk. But it would be better to think quickly. You can't get a refund for the rod that's already been hit.\"\"What nonsense!\"\"Oh, yeah. That's too much. That's my specialty. I'm coming!\"Chung-Myung quickly jumped on Gong Munyeon.Seeing Chung-Myung closing the gap in an instant, Gong Munyeon unknowingly backed away.It's not like it's spouting steam. However, it did not mean that the sword in his hand would be a great seasonal event. The masked man, who seemed to fall down at any moment, just moved his legs and rushed, but Gong Munyeon was surprised and forced to step down.Of course, the speed at which he stepped down could not have been faster than that of Chung-Myung.Chung-Myung's sword is swung around to target Gong Munyeon's left knee. Gong Munyeon, who thought it was too late to avoid, wrapped his arm around his knee.Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!Soon, Chung-Myung's sword hits Gong Munyeon on the shoulder.\"Ugh!\"I can't help but bawl.Shoulders?It was definitely a leg, but why are you suddenly getting punched in the shoulder?But there was no time to think. Chung-Myung's sword, which hit Gong Munyeon on the shoulder, hits Gong Munyeon on the head again.This time I definitely grabbed the right angle and blocked it over my head.Oh my god!My eyes are blurry at the momentarily.The world darkens and slowly regains its color. At the same time, I was suffocated and had a sore throat.\"Oops!\"Chung-Myung's sword stabbed him in the neck. I didn't cut my throat because it was a sword that wasn't pulled out of the sword, but the sword, which is like a lump of metal, stung my throat, so would it be a pain?Tears seeped out, and my whole body trembled.Argh! Argh!Meanwhile, Chung-Myung's sword falls down.Shoulder, head, waist.Now he was wielding his sword like a dog in the village.The amazing and stuffy nose is the fact that Gong Munyeon was never able to avoid it properly even though he was wielding a sword so recklessly. If you twist your shoulders, you will hit your waist, and if you pull your waist back, you will hit your head.Gong Munyeon, who soon became a mess, was frightened and backed away.'Ju, porridge...\u2026'The fear of being really beaten to death dominated Gong Munyeon momentarily.As soon as you open your eyes and look forward, Gong Munyeon and Chung-Myung's eyes meet each other.And at that moment, Gong Munyeon could tell.snowThe moment he saw Chung-Myung's eyes without any emotion, Gong Munyeon felt it.He's seen those eyes over and over again in his life. And those with those eyes had a common characteristic.Murder ears.I don't know what it is, but it's clear that the author has killed countless people. To beat Gong Munyeon to death would be like catching a fly.As soon as the sword, which was swung like a joke, was pulled out of the sword, Gong Munyeon was sure to cut his throat without being able to rebel.\"Oh, no! No!'I don't want to die. At least I don't want to die here!At that moment, Chung-Myung's sword was pulled out of the search. Soon, it is struck by Gong Munyeon's head at a speed like light.\"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\"Gong Munyeon's hands glowed blue. Then it shoots off like an island war at Chung-Myung wielding a sword.Screaming!Gong Munyeon, who hit Ho Gong, stopped in that position with his arm outstretched.\"\u2026\u2026.\"to have noneChung-Myung wasn't where it was supposed to be. Gong Munyeon, who came to his senses, hurriedly raised his head, and Chung-Myung, who had already crossed his legs from far away, was pushing the sword into the search.Chung-Myung's mouth opened.\"Taeul Shinsu?\"\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"You son of a b*tc*?\"Gong Munyeon, who noticed his mistake at the moment, turned pale.\"Are you a pro-Nam guy?\"And soon it was horribly distorted.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Doesn't it mean that even if you're taken to a tiger's den, you'll live as long as you wake up.\"Moo, I don't know what you mean.\"\"Ha, look at him.\"Chung-Myung snorted.\"He thinks I have a hole in my eye. Do I look like a man who doesn't recognize Taeul Shinsu?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung said with all his teeth.\"That's a coincidence. Coincidentally, the person who ran a base in harmony and pressed for debt to Wasan is learning Jongnam's martial arts, right? You've learned a lot about Taeul Shinsu.A cold sweat fell from Gong Munyeon's forehead. I was so surprised that I couldn't feel the pain of being beaten.God d*mn it.I had to put up with it.Even if the neck is cut off, it is impossible to use Taeul Shinsu. Besides, in front of a man from Hwasan!a capital errorBut can I call this a mistake?If the author hadn't driven Gong Munyeon so hard, and if he hadn't suddenly pulled out a real sword in front of Gong Munyeon, who was busy getting beaten, Gong Munyeon wouldn't have used Taeulshin even if he was dying.If it is a coincidence, it is the worst coincidence, and if it is intended, it is hard to guess how deep the author's heart is.\"Did you spend it in Jongnam?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Gong Munyeon shut his mouth tightly.No matter what I say now, it can't be an excuse anyway. If I could turn the situation around with a lame excuse, I would do as much as I could, but now it is impossible.Then it would have been better to shut up rather than open your mouth and give more information.\"Huh? You're going to shut up.\"Chung-Myung approached Gong Munyeon, cracking his neck.\"Well, that's good, that's loyalty. I think it's a good choice. But there's one thing you're confused about.\"\"\u2026\u2026?\"\"Do you know what that is?\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"\"I'm not going to tell you.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jongnam is not a very easy place. Jong-nam has not been very emotional because he has been at odds with Hwasan since the past, but at least he has to admit that Jong-nam is a big fan of old file rooms.There is no way that such a literary group would make a sloppy job of it. That's what Chung-Myung thought. The information that Gong Munyeon knows will be extremely limited, and even if more information is known, that information cannot be correct.It's over if you know it's related to Jongnam. Isn't that what Chung-Myung or Hwasan needs to figure out?Of course you don't have to tell Gong Munyeon that fact.\"Ha, you bastards. But the old crowd wasn't cheap, even though they were grim, but they're not even merciless, and they're trying to steal other people's doors with money? Is that a scam? It's a very good thing to do.\"Gong Munyeon could no longer keep his composure and shouted.\"Well, wouldn't that be better for Hawasan?\"\"Huh?\"\"You know that! Hawasan is hopeless now, wealth? Money? That's just an addition to Mufah. Having lost his martial arts, he can no longer be the former one. It's just a difference between failing a little faster or failing a little longer!\"\"Whoa?\"Chung-Myung listened to Gong Munyeon's story as if it was funny.\"I was just trying to break the dying Wasan's breathing quickly. It's something that Hwasan should be grateful for. I'm sure anyone around you would know. That Hawasan couldn't survive any more! The literature, which has lost its masters of martial arts, simply dies.\"Who said that?\"\"Don't you understand?\"\"No, who says that Hawasan's martial arts was cut off?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Gong Munyeon looked at Chung-Myung with blank eyes.If someone else had said this, I would have snorted. But the words that came out of Chung-Myung's mouth had a different weight.At least Chung-Myung, who you can see in Gong Munyeon's eyes, was definitely a master of Hawasan's\"These bastards are trying to cut off the well-being of Hawasan. And! If you live or die, you'll die. Why are you guys trying to bury your well-off man. What authority do you have?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Anyways, the muzzle-muckers bring all sorts of lame logic. Why don't you just say that Hawasan was f*cked to death. If you do that, I'll admit it.\"I beat him up a lot.Neighbors living nearby are more likely to bump into each other. Just as long-distance work is fundamental to diplomacy, adjacent doorways must be crossed. Hwasan and Jongnam had many similarities in that they had strong inner style, and they also used swords to each other was similar.If a similar line of capitalism is located right next to it, one of them will die unconditionally.In the past, Chung-Myung also beat Jong Nam when he was bored. It was exactly what happened to Chung-Myung after picking a fight in Jongnam.\"I'm not Jongnam's man!\"\"I guess so.\"\"You seem to be mistaken, but I've just learned that trick by accidentally.\"\"Oh, yeah. I will. Do you want me to tell you a very surprising.\"\"\u2026\u2026What's that?\"\"I'm not a Hawaiian either.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"That makes sense...\u2026.\"\"You, you son of a b*tc*!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung was about to spit on the floor.Mask. That was close.\"Anyways, I'll show you something interesting in return for showing you Taeul-shin. It's gonna be a lot of fun if you find out about this. It'd be sad if you didn't recognize me.\"Chung-Myung slowly stuck out his sword.\"Tell the man who sent you clearly.\"Chung-Myung's prayers have changed.The playful appearance so far disappears. The bent waist straightened out, and the drooping shoulders regain their shape.Perfect posture as if it were a picture.Gong Munyeon, who saw it, opened his mouth without realizing it.The wind seems to be blowing from somewhere.With a clear wind, the scent of plum blossoms blooms like a fantasy.\"The plum blossoms give off the deepest scent when they bloom in the snow. Although it is winter now, the spirit of Hawasan is unbroken. When spring comes, plum blossoms bloom in full bloom.\"Gong Munyeon saw it.Chung-Myung's sword tip moves slowly.Nervous.The movement, which began with a tiny tremor, soon turned into a great tremor, and the great tremor soon turned into a sword's trajectory, which was like a fantasy embroidered with the sky.End of sword full of sky.Vivid plum petals bloom at the end of the sword.After the bleak winter, plum blossoms that heralded warm spring bloomed all over the mountain, and plum blossoms painted by Chung-Myung's sword tips covered the world.It's an illusion.'The wind is blowing.As if flying in the spring wind, plum blossoms that covered the sky began to spread in unison. It was not long before the petals flew up to the sky and fell still on Gong Munyeon's forehead.The petals gently brushed Gong Munyeon and blew his consciousness like the wind. Until the end, he didn't know what he was looking at.Flop.Only the sound of Gong Munyeon falling to the floor, unconscious, rings hollow. The plum blossoms that covered the sky disappeared like a mirage.Chung-Myung, who recovered the sword, turned around.\"Spit it out!\"Blood vessels flow back to the mouth due to excessive chi operation. Chung-Myung, who took off his mask and spat out a surge of blood, distorted his face.I'm dying, really.A broken body, even so, still lacks history. If it was him in the past, it feels like all the history of his entire body is being sucked away just by a sword that he would have drawn as a joke.I like the foundation, but I'm going to die. Ouch.'Chung-Myung rewears the mask thinking that he needs to come up with some countermeasures.\"Well, then.\"His eyes went beyond Gong Munyeon, who fell to the floor, to merchants.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Merchants look at Chung-Myung with eyes as if they are seeing ghosts.Why wouldn't that be the case?I have never seen a flower that blooms plum blossoms in the sky with a sword. No, I was told that there were such dead people in Hawasan in the past, but I thought it was an exaggerated legend.But the man who tore out the legend is standing in front of them now.Chung-Myung is nothing short of a grim reaper for their part in trying to extort money from Hawasan.\"Who wants to be beaten up?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Who wants to go?\"\"Me!\"\"I'll just go!\"\"Save me, please!\"He nods loudly as if he likes Chung-Myung.\"All right, very cooperative.\"Merchants rushed out to the side. But of course Chung-Myung didn't mean to let them go so easily.\"Stop moving.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The merchants came to a halt in unison.\"How am I supposed to lead all these carts if you go away like that? Think about it, think about it!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Merchants looked at Chung-Myung with eyes full of injustice.You're saying we have to look at the convenience of the robber? No matter how backwards the world turns, there is no law like this.But no one could bear to say no.\"You guys.\"\"Yes!\"\"From now on, we each check how much wealth is in our carts. I'll put the last one next to him.\"I didn't need any more words. As soon as the words were over, merchants rushed into their carts and began to calculate their wealth.\"That's 1,800 cats!\"\"Two thousand and three hundred cats!\"\"I'm eight thousand\u2026\u2026.\"\"What, did you have so much money?\"\"Does that matter now? You fool?\"They even bicker among themselves and run amok to report first.Chung-Myung frowned while looking at it.\"Hey.\"\"Yes?\"\"Did you include the cost of a cart and a horse?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Calculate again.\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung nodded when the calculation was done somehow.\"Then I'll lend you a horse, and one of you go to the nearest battlefield and get the money. I'll sell it in kind.\"Merchants looked at Chung-Myung with blank eyes.They are also people who roll on the floor of money, but I have never seen such a person in my life.\"Get the money in a non-disclosure slip. If you mark it on the slip and get caught, you'll be killed today. Okay?\"\"Yes.\"You're so meticulous.\"Go away.\"\"\u2026\u2026well.\"\"What?\"One of the merchants asked.\"What happens if the man who goes to the battlefield runs away?\"Chung-Myung smirks.\"What are you going to do when you run away?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Do you guys have money?\"\"No.\"\"Your property has been repossessed, hasn't it?\"\"Yes.\"\"Then what are you gonna do if you run away? If you want to get a review, you'll have to come back.\"\"\u2026\u2026then if you report it to the coffin...\u2026.\"\"Try it.\"Chung-Myung lifted his leg and hit the floor.Boom!The floor cracks.\"Instead, report it and never come back. Run to the end of the continent. I'll catch him even if I die. Never come back.

I don't think the government can catch this guy.\"Let's go.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes.\"Hawasan was gracious as a prestigious political party.Nevertheless, there was only one reason why they were unhappy. Hawasan is benevolent, but not everyone in Hawasan is benevolent.Even before sunset that day, a masked man with a book-thick slip in his hand climbed up the Wasan with joy.

The wind is still the same, and the antique halls are still the same.It wasn't just the Hwasan that changed, it was the man.\"Whoops!\"Jo-Gol is out of uniform. Sweat flows out as I grab the martial arts thrown off. After training from dawn, your whole body is soaked in sweat and you can't stand without changing your clothes.\"Oh, today's training was really tough.\"\"I don't know if I should do this early in the morning.\"Jo-Gol smiled bitterly as he heard the words. His surroundings were full of clothes-washing motives like him. Together, they washed their whole bodies with icy streams and washed their sweaty robes clean.Jo-Gol put on his new clothes and packed the laundry well.\"Let's go up.\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"Celadon boats picked up their laundered robes and began climbing the Hawasan. Looking at it from behind, Jo-Gol had no choice but to think about it.'That's a lot of changes.'I wouldn't have dreamed of seeing this before. Celadon boats were not enthusiastic about learning martial arts, although they were Hwasan's Mundo. The same was true of even the metabolites, Yoon-jong or Jo-Gol.But now, everyone has voluntarily left early in the morning to train. There was no end to complaints, but no one led to rebellion.What do you call this scene?It's like nothing to do with it.'Jo-Gol was smirking.Seeing the three great disciples of Hawasan, I can't believe I'm looking like an uncrowned figure. So until now, Hawasan has not been uncrowned?\"Why are you laughing like that?\"Jo-Gol turned his head to the sound coming from the side. Ambassador Yoon-jong was looking back at Jo-Gol with great success.\"Oh, the death penalty. \u2026\u2026It's a little embarrassing to say, but I think everyone now has a no-view.\"\"Is that so?\"\"It's a little strange, though.\"\"No. I was just thinking the same thing.\"\"Haha\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol ended up laughing out loud.Not long ago, Jo-Gol had never imagined training in Wasan by sweating. The training instructed by the White House was done without exception, but it was more of an effort than a quota.Jo-Gol's goal was to kill time moderately and then descend and return home. No, it would have been everyone else's goal, not just Jo-Gol.So can there be passion?However, I think something has changed recently. Not only that, but the eyes of other death penalty have changed a lot.I guess this is all about him.'Jo-Gol's face, which reminds me of Chung-Myung, is slightly distorted.Chung-Myung was changing Hawasan. It's obviously only a small wind now, but no one knows yet whether it will end up as a breeze or become a huge typhoon that will shake the entire city of Hawasan.But in the cool future, it will surely have its effect.Jo-Gol, who jumped up the mountain and entered Hawasan's prose, straightened his shoulders. A corner of my heart was overwhelmed.But the pride soon flew high into the sky.\"Hey, you can't hold it there!\"\"Fly, fly, fly! We're going to push all the materials inside and then start! Are you deaf?\"\"There! If you break there, you'll have no pay for a month! It was so hard to climb up here. What are you doing?\"Jo-Gol stared blankly at the sight of Hawasan. It's very busy and chaotic.\"\u2026\u2026.\"His gaze shifts greatly from left to right.What are these people?'People I've never seen before are coming in and out of prose. Everyone had tools and materials in their hands for the first time.\"There. No, not there! That way!\"It is comforting to know someone among them. Unam was standing among the people and giving instructions urgently.\"\u2026\u2026 death penalty?\"Yoon-jong, who was looked at by Jo-Gol, walks toward Unam with a blank face.\"Sasukjo.\"\"Hmm? Is it Yoon-jong?\"\"What's all this about?\"\"Oh.\"Unam smiled brightly.Normally, I would not have explained one by one to Yoon-jong, who was only the three greatest disciples, but Unam was in a very good mood now. So there's nothing I can't explain.\"It's the workers.\"\"Worker?\"\"Well, you know, aren't the halls very old?\"\"That's right.\"It's not just that it's old.It's so old that it's almost crumbly that something breaks and is swept away when the wind blows. At least the places where the disciples lived and where they trained somehow maintained their form. Most Cabinet offices were left unattended without minimal management due to a lack of manpower to manage.\"I'm going to take this opportunity to make a big pay. Re-establish the prose.\"\"Yes?\"\"Don't just look and go and carry the material. The workers must have had a hard time bringing the materials all the way here. Most wood can be made by cutting nearby, but there must be wood that doesn't grow here.\"\"Yes?\"\"Move fast, move fast! Come on!\"Jo-Gol gave a blank look to Unam, who was smiling and shouting.Perhaps change is coming faster than he thought.\"What's going on?\"Jo-Gol looked at the table with absurd eyes.Hunger soared to the neck thanks to one more effort to carry the materials. However, the food on the table is more absurd than hungry.\"What is this?\"\"\u2026\u2026Am I dreaming?\"\"No matter how many times you look at it, it's something called meat.\"Other death penalty reactions were similar. Their eyes were fixed on the table.A great deal happened on the table.The meat has come up.\"Do you mean there's such a thing to be angry about?\"\"The crystal of evil business that killed the living and ripped the body off is on the table of the holy Doga.\"\"It's a windfall!\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol let out a grin.There was no particular ban on plantation or meat in Hawasan.There is a discipline that recommends vegetarianism and bans meat-eating in the whole way that Hwasan succeeded it, but it has changed a lot in his generation. Vegetarianism is recommended, but meat eating is not prohibited.But not forbidding cannot be the same as putting meat on the table.It's been several years since I entered Hawasan, but this is the first time I've seen meat on the Hawaiian table.\"Can I eat this?\"\"I think you put it on the table to eat.\"Everyone looks at Yoon-jong's eyes. The decision maker is Yoon-jong unless the private servants are here.Yoon-jong nodded with a wry smile.\"Let's eat for now. It's going to cool down.\"\"Yes.\"Jo-Gol, once seated by Yoon-Jong, felt a sudden prickly stare and raised his head. All the death penalty is Jo-Gol...\u2026. No, exactly, I'm looking at Yoon-jong sitting next to Jo-Gol.Knowing the intentions of the death penalty, Yoon-jong grabbed a chopstick and picked up a piece of meat. And the moment the meat goes into Yoon-jong's mouth.Papapapapapapad!Chopsticks fly into the bowl from all directions!There were even guys who used gold threads to catch fish. Jo-Gol almost screamed at the sight. But his body was more honest than his head. Jo-Gol's chopsticks also flew into the bowl like lightning.You can't eat if you're late!'\"Get out of my way, my meat!\"Meat! Meat!Yoon-jong closed his eyes as he looked at the fragments of the meat scattering everywhere.Hwasan\u110b\u1175.His wasan is turning into something strange.\"Well, it's a long life and a business.\"\"You're right.\"\"They start construction all of a sudden, and there's no meat on the table. Even two new uniforms were given out today, right?\"\"I did.\"Yoon-jong opened his eyes as if he was thinking something. Jo-Gol, who was looking at the mysterious look,\"What are you thinking?\"\"I think money is very good.\"\"Huh.\"Jo-Gol stopped laughing.I don't know if it's anyone else, but it feels weird to hear this from Yoon-jong.Do it, it's the same with the others.\"No matter how much money I had, I didn't expect my superiors to change anything so quickly.\"\"Do you think they should have kept their disciples poor? It couldn't be helped without it.\"That\u2019s right.It's not that meat didn't come out because it's against the law. It didn't come out because the meat was expensive.\"I couldn't do it because I didn't have enough money, so I do it when I have money. But what's so weird about it?\"Jo-Gol nodded.\"\u2026\u2026Didn't you see Unam Sangho can't help but smile?\"That's right.I saw it.Jo-Gol, I swear, had never seen Unam smile so brightly in his life. It could be someone who doesn't know how to laugh. Have you ever thought about it?What a laugh you have made of such a man!What is clear is that the present-day Hawasan is on the road to change.\"Death penalty.\"\"Hmm?\"\"What do you think will happen now?\"It was an incoherent question, but Yoon-jong understood what Jo-Gol meant.\"You know that, don't you? Hwasan is already changing rapidly.\"\"Yes.\"\"So we need to be prepared.\"\"Be prepared...\"\"It's not just a matter of money. Didn't you see it, too. In the crate.\"\"Yes, there was a rain check.\"I still can see the scene where Jang Moon-in was moving back saying the name of the warrior.\"Hwasan is changing. And it will change. We can't avoid change either. Therefore, we must strengthen our will and work hard. Then can't we see something different than we expected?\"Jo-Gol nodded.\"Is this all because of him?'Jo-Gol could not help but suspect that the whole situation was caused by Chung-Myung's manipulation some time ago. I frown automatically when I think of the obvious performance.\"What did he do?\"\"Do they understand?\"There was no subject, but it wasn't Yoon-jong who didn't know who it was referring to.\"What's certain is that he's not something we can guess ahead of time. You'd better get your act together. He could be swept away by the luck he creates with his clumsy determination.\"\"Don't worry, death penalty. I'm Jo-Gol.\"\"Yes, I did.\"Yoon-jong smiled and headed for the white plum. A slightly different idea lingered in Jo-Gol's mind, who followed him quietly.'We can't have a clue.'Jo-Gol's idea was a little different.Maybe Chung-Myung can't handle not only them but also the elders and the elders. Maybe.\"By the way.\"\"Huh?\"\"Where is he?\" I haven't seen you since this morning.\"\"Didn't you hear that? A man of long letters found him today. Probably in the place of a long writer by now.\"\"You're a long man? Why would a long writer look for him again?\"\"Do they understand?\"Jo-Gol let out a low sigh as Yoon-Jong shrugged.\"I'm so out of my mind.\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cough! It's all right.\"\"Did you really like it'\"\"That's okay. Cough! Cough!\"\"You don't look fine\u2026\u2026.\"Hyun Jong distorted his face and looked at Chung-Myung. Chung-Myung sitting in front of me was not a horse. I'm skinned and white-faced.\"How bad is your health?'No matter how much I look at it, it looks like I'm about to die See a stranger, his disciples pijuktto not feed might ask why swearing and spitting on it will remain the same.I don't think it was like this when I first came.'Hyun Jong turned his head with a subtle face and asked Unam.\"What did the medicine say?\"\"They say they're not feeling well.\"\"Energy?\"\"Yes, it is said that excessive training has damaged your energy and needs to be suppressed.\"\"Huh!\"Hyun-jong looked at Chung-Myung with moving eyes.\"Dude, you're training until you're blue in the face. Why did you do such a stupid thing?\"'That's not it.'Training is freezing to death.Chung-Myung hasn't had a proper training since climbing to Hawaii. What kind of training is this?Of course that's all the medicine party had to say. It's true that my energy is damaged and my body is damaged. How can I imagine that a newbie who just started writing his birthright broke up? Even if Hwata was sitting in the medical center, it is not an answer that can be made.Weird misunderstandings have arisen, but at times like this, we have to answer honestly.\"I'm sorry, Jang Moon-in. I wanted to learn the martial arts of Hawasan as soon as possible so I stopped...\u2026.\"\"Huh, good boy, good boy.\"Jang Moon-in nodded as if he liked Chung-Myung more.Chung-Myung did not lie. It's true at heart!\"Hurried rice makes you sick. What can you do only when you're sick?\"\"I will be more careful, my pupil.\"\"Yes, yes.\"Hyun Jong smiled pleasedly.The child before us is literally Hawasan's Hongbok. It's nothing short of a rolling fortune. So how come it's not pretty?\"Yes, do you enjoy tea?\"\"I don't really enjoy it.\"Chung-Myung shrugged.I don't know if it's alcohol.Chung-Myung's taste is too much of a bath. Unlike alcohol that piqued the throat, tea was just grassy water.Jang Moon-sa-hyung said that Chung-Myung was a hard man to become a master in the first place, but what can he do about his taste?Is there a law that says long-time Hawasan should enjoy tea?'In the past, long death sentences were also well versed in tea ceremony. And in Chung-Myung's view, Jang Moon-in, now, was not very good at riding a car.Jang Moon-in hands out the car he carefully rode to Chung-Myung. Chung-Myung picked up the car with both hands.\"I'm sorry you don't enjoy it, but taste it, Bondo.\"\"Yes.\"Regardless of the scent process, Chung-Myung gulped down the tea at once.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Although there is a greater pleasure in enjoying the scent than the original taste of tea, it seemed that tea to Chung-Myung meant nothing more than hot water.Looking at it with a sad face, Hyun-jong asked as soon as Chung-Myung put down the tea cup.\"How do you like it?\"\"It's cold.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"There was a subtle disappointment in Hyun Jong's solemn face, but Chung-Myung was just honest in his duty.\"Well, yeah.\"Hyun Jong, who blew up the awkwardness with a cough, gently releases his expression again.\"I called you back here to give you a compliments on this. Thanks to you, Hawasan was able to get out of the woods. You've done a great job.\"\"I haven't done anything.\"\"How could you not have done anything? If it weren't for you, we'd be on the streets by now.\"\"I just happened to walk past it, and I just happened to get stuck in the box.\"\"Huh. It's a coincidence.\"Hyun Jong shakes his head still.\"There is no such thing as a coincidence. Everything is just a consequence of a connection.\"Chung-Myung nodded still.I'm just saying, but Hyun Jong's words hit the nail on the head.'There are times when he's so sharp.'\"Didn't she? Unam?\"\"Yes, Jang Moon-in. And even if all of this was made by accident, the ball that caused the accident is not small either. Besides, I didn't want to be rich, but I informed the long-term writer, so how can I say, \"How can I say?\"\"Yes, yes.\"Hyun Jong swept away his beard as if he was willing to.\"Do it.\"Then, look at Chung-Myung with warm eyes.\"It's only natural to reward those who have done their best. Hawasan is about to award you. That's why I called you.\"\"Did you say a prize?\"\"Yes, is there anything you want?\"Chung-Myung is a bit worried.What do you want?\"It would be a lie if you could pass on that wealth and not regret it. If you need wealth, I'll give you proper wealth.\"\"Wealth is fine.\"\"Hmm?\"Hyun Jong opened his eyes slightly wide.\"Did you say you didn't need wealth?\"\"Yes, they feed us and give us clothes anyway, so what's the use of wealth? It's not like there's anything to use in the mountains.\"\"Hahaha. Yes, it is.\"Hyun Jong smiled.It's a pottery.It is not easy to abandon one's greed for wealth, however useless it is. You don't have to spend money now, but you don't have to spend it in the future, do you?He doesn't seem to be a child who can't guess such a thing, but he's a child who practices no desire to refuse wealth. It was a bowl to embrace the province.However, Chung-Myung's inner thoughts were completely different from the warm interpretation of Hyun Jong.\"How much is it to doin'?'a secret warehouse for a long writer Now, the secret warehouse used by Chung-Myung, not the long-time writer of Hwasan, is piled up with wealth that would turn his eyes upside down and faint if Hyun Jong saw it.Chung-Myung is already the richest man in harmony.You don't have to receive any small sum of money from a poor writer.\"Then what do you want? It may help you pre-learn martial arts that you can't yet learn in four rows.\"\"I don't mind not studying.\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh? Is this okay?\"\"Yes.\"\"Did you find martial arts meaningless?\"Chung-Myung shook his head again.\"It's not like that. Although the disciple does not know everything, I think there is a meaning to all the martial arts that the good men of Hawasan will learn in accordance with the line of succession.\"Hyun Jong opened his eyes wide.\"Really?\"\"Yes. Didn't the writer just say that the hasty meal will upset you?\"\"\"I did.\"\"I think the same goes for Muhak. I'll learn what's right for me and make sure to move on even though it's slow.\"\"Yes, you're right. You are absolutely right.\"Hyun Jong nodded constantly.The more we talk, the more I like it. Doesn't a young child still know what province is and what reason is?\"Where did you come from?'It was Hyun Jong who was so willing that he couldn't hide his laughter, but of course Chung-Myung's idea was completely different.I'll have to give you credit. Dude!Chung-Myung, who was worried about how to hand over other things other than the martial arts he delivered this time, was troubled.It would have been convenient if I had handed it all over at once. However, the human mind has a strange side, so if you give both gold and silver statues at the same time, it devalues the value of silver statues.Who will learn the sword if you give it both the Twenty-four Plum Blossom and Chimae sword? As Hyun Jong said, you'll get indigestion if you eat in a hurry.'You have to pay attention to every single one of these things.'Long death. I'm sorry.I'm sorry that I listened to it in one ear and spilled it in the other when Jang Moon-sa nagged me. I should have known how hard it was for him.Half-way through the eyes of a long writer, I can see how hard it must have been for the long-time writer, Cheon Mun. And Chung-Myung would have taken up much of the trouble.I should have listened.It's hard to atone for the already dead Cheon Mun, but Chung-Myung was determined to be good to even the long-time writers.\"It is good that you are not greedy, but it is a little difficult for me now. Okay, so you don't need anything?\"'It's necessary.'What can I do for Chung-Myung in the only thing left?Chung-Myung, who was worried, opened his mouth.Once you can secure some freedom of personal freedom, the radius of movement widens. It is more urgent than anything else.\"The long-time disciple does not slacken in learning martial arts.\"\"I can tell from the looks of you.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung, who had a small cough, continued.\"But I think there's a limit to just learning Muhak in this clean measure. I want to see the wide world once in a while. Please let me go down to the chord whenever I want.\"\"Hmm.\"Hyun Jong slightly narrowed his forehead.\"I understand your intentions. That is against the rules of Hawasan. Your contribution is good enough, but then you'll be afraid of anyone complaining about equity. Let me think about it.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Do you have anything else?\"Chung-Myung, who was worried, opened his eyes wide.\"Long man!\"\"Hmm?\"\"As you can see, he's not feeling well.\"\"Yes, we'll know if we have eyes.\"\"The drugstore says it's been deflated.\"\"Yes, I've heard of it.\"\"So, could you please drop me off?\"\"\u2026\u2026English?\"\"Yes, the English language of Hawasan. Isn't there usually something like that in Moonpa?\"Hyun Jong burst into laughter.\"Hahaha. Yeah. You need Youngdan. Yeah, I like Youngdan. Is there anything more to supplement the body?\"\"Yes, I am!\"\"Hahaha. Yes, Youngdan. Yes. If it's your work, it's enough to be judged. Yeah, well...\"Yes, sir.Hyun Jong is looking at Chung-Myung. Then he spoke in a soft voice.\"Did you say you wanted to go down to the chords once in a while?\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes?\"\"Of course, it's against the rules, but I can do you that much considering your contribution. Listen to Unam.\"\"Yes, long-time man!\"\"Hwasan's student Chung-Myung does not get permission from others when he goes down to the chord in the future.\"\"Yes!\"\"However, Chung-Myung must keep the chords in mind that everything he does in the chords cannot escape that responsibility. Do you understand?\"\"Yes, I see. By the way\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung tilts his head.What about Youngdan?\"Also, it should not affect the training in the harmony.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Hahaha. Yeah. Then get out of here.\"\"Oh, no, long story. Youngdan\u2026\u2026.\"\"I have high expectations for you. Keep your head above water.\"\"\u2026\u2026yes.\"\"Yes.\"\"Precious. \"The Long Writers.\"Hyun Jong grinned as Chung-Myung bowed his head and trudged out.\"I'll never eat and die, you son of a b*tc*!'I'd rather die than suffer.Rather than sick.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why not? Thanks to Chung-Myung, Hawasan escaped the crisis of extinction. The enemy did not invade, the internal strife did not occur, and only because of the money, we were able to escape the most disgraceful situation in which Hawasan, a history and tradition, lowered the signboard.Therefore, it is not enough for Hyun-jong to carry Chung-Myung on his back.But now this assessment is not due to such beauty.\"Even as a child, words are wise. Sometimes it's rough, but considering the age, it's understandable.\"\"Right.\"Unam's thoughts deepened at the addition of the long-winded writer.When I'm talking to Chung-Myung, I don't feel like I'm talking to a child. It wasn't just the way of speaking. I can't feel the unique hitting of a child in Chung-Myung.How should I put this?Am I the only one who feels good?'It smells like Doga.This feeling could not be explained by logic. The scent of a door in a child.I can't explain it unless it's a pottery.'Unam raised his head slightly.\"It's thoughtful, not like a child. There is also a side to consider before speaking. He is intelligent in many ways.\"\"Right.\"\"As long as you're sure it's no good\u2026\u2026will have the capacity to lead the next generation of Hawasan.\"Hyun Jong nodded silently. Then I turned my eyes and looked at Hyun Sang.\"What do you think?\"Hyun Sang, who had only been watching the situation so far, drooled.\"Don't you know that I don't know how to see people?\"\"Hey, don't you still have a feeling?\"\"Feeling...\"\"Hyun Sang closed his eyes still.Time goes by slowly. Hyun Sang, who had been in thought for a long time, slowly opened his mouth.\"The child is not like a child.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I know that often children who have lived rough lives and thoughtful children show that. But that means you're mature for your age, doesn't it mean you're like an adult?\"Hyun Sang, who asked for consent slightly, continues.\"But he's not precocious, he talks like an adult and acts like an adult. To the point where I want to bring out what's in it.\"\"Do you mean black inside?\"\"That's not what I meant. But....\"Hyun Sang shortened his words.\"I see.\"Hyun Jong nodded.\"I know what you're all thinking, but don't put too much weight on it right now. As you can see, isn't he a child?\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"We're not the ones who use people, we're the ones who nurture people. If you're a great talent, you can show them your talent, and if you're a kid with a problem, you can lead them to fix it.\"\"You're right.\"\"Unam.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"How is the construction going?\"\"It's not easy to fill up the materials because of the rough mountains. We're cutting down the trees as much as we can, but we can't help the time it takes to dry and trim the cut trees. It will take some time.\"\"I see.\"Hyun Jong, who swept down his beard, asked with a serious face.\"Didn't you disapprove of me for caring about the appearance of money?\"\"That can't be true, long-winded\"Please understand. Hawasan should be born again now. When a person makes a new promise and makes a new will, he or she purifies his or her clothes and straightens his or her body. This is no different for the Moon faction. This was considered most certain to convey a new meaning to the Mundo.\"\"The will of the long man is right.\"Hyun Jong nods his head still.\"Priest.\"\"Yes, long death.\"Hyun Sang slightly lowers his head.\"Finish the newly acquired interpretation of Muhak as soon as possible. One, there should be no laxity. Depending on how you pass on the martial arts to your disciples, the fate of Hwasan will change.\"\"I'll make sure there's not an inch of weakness.\"\"I'm counting on you.\"Hyun Sang slightly hardened his face when he saw Hyun Jong, who seemed to be lost in thought.'Should I say it?'No. Never mind.Maybe it's just old women. Long death sentence is now envisioning the future of Hawasan, which will last a thousand years. I can't get you to care about nothing.'However...'Hyun Sang sighed softly.When I discovered B-rated, I was so shocked that I didn't feel strange. However, it is hard to get rid of the curiosity these days as it is looking through the process of interpreting the payment.\"The paper is too clean to call it a book that's at least 100 years old.'And there were traces of ink smudging in places.If Hyun Sang's suspicions are correct, this grade is not from a hundred years ago. It's a relatively recent grade someone has created.But who the hell?Who can produce the actual martial arts in Hawasan? It doesn't make sense in common sense.If there was anyone who could do such a thing, it would be better to come with a salary than to make it so that it could be discovered. Then all of Hawasan's Mundo will hold him like a king.That means there's someone in Wasan who needs to be helped but not revealed.Hyun Sang shook his head.That's too much. That's too much.I thought there might be a conspiracy, so I reviewed and reviewed martial arts, but this is genuine no matter how many times I look at it. There is nothing wrong, there is nothing wrong. There's nothing special about it even if you wash your eyes and look for it.Let's go over it one more time.'If it's strange, it won't be too late to tell you then.* * *\"Eh, I'm not even gonna pick up the beggars!\"Chung-Myung kicked a stone.\"What have you done that you don't have any English left!\"I can guess from the look on the face of a long writer. It was clear that there were no plum blossoms left in this literary group.It is absolutely hopeless.If you didn't have the money to manufacture the Jasodan, now that you have the money, the answer is...'Wait for now.'But Jang chose to change the subject instead of telling him to wait.That means that not only is there no Yeongdan in Hawasan now, but also the method of making Yeongdan has been put into practice.\"There's not one thing that's fine!\"I'm so frustrated.No matter who deliberately plotted to destroy Hwasan, there can be a variety of destruction in such various areas.No martial arts, no spirit, no people, no money?\"I'm not screwed up. Well!\"What would you do if you were angry? This is all my karma. Chung-Myung patted his lower abdomen, smacking his lips.Ha, this is a pain in the ass.'My body doesn't recover as easily as I thought. I thought I should be prepared for side effects because it was a child's body whose musculature was not yet completed and he used his birthmark in a situation where he had little history.\u2026.The problem is, it's not as much.'My body doesn't recover more than I thought.Perhaps there was a habit of implicitly using the body of the past and the level of the past.That's it.If Chung-Myung had been told that a child would use birth control, he would have grabbed not only the child but also the people around him who couldn't stop him and hit the cheek.That's how dangerous it is.But that's the way it is with people. There's nothing left, but I used to think it might. And it's a disgrace.The problem was that Chung-Myung was the one who humiliated his defeat. Since the body is not recovering, training is not easy, and training is not easy, so martial arts does not increase.The degree of suffocation was too much to take as the price of rekindling Hawasan. If this continues, we'll have to attend at least half a year in Jeongyang.\"Half a year frozen to death!\"What if it's an old man's body? Half a year at this young age is so deadly. Half a year now is like a decade in the distant future.I'm not just trying to recover and be comfortable. Now Chung-Myung is building a perfect foundation. But isn't the human body the earth?A child grows and changes. As such, there is a reasonable time. If you miss this period, there is something you can never make again. Shouldn't your body build the basics when you learn martial arts on its own?\"I have to find a way.\"Chung-Myung is troubled with a serious face.\"First of all, we have to have Young-dan\u2026\u2026.\"The decline in energy can only be cured by energy. If it is not solved by taking it easy, you should take a large amount of energy at once to fill the birthmark.Then there are two ways.They need to eat precious young dan or get help from stomata such as grid power.However, there is no way that Chung-Myung can get someone to give him a solid power, nor can he get Youngdan.Youngdan is not something you can buy just because you have money. Besides, isn't Chung-Myung a child's body now? Unable to leave the chord, it was almost impossible for him to save Young-dan.to have no solution\"Oh, come on, you don't even have dog poop for medicine! What the f*ck is there no such thing as an Englishman on his doorstep? f*ckin' y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all!Young-dan rolled on the floor, adding a little lie to the former Hawasan.Jasodan was common enough to eat at least one Mundo in a lifetime, and Seolmaedan was so common that it would fall into a prize even if he had to set up a ball somewhere or practice hard.And plum blossoms?\"It wasn't even medicine.\"Plum beds were too common to be treated as medicine. Chung-Myung wouldn't have asked for plum beds if it wasn't for the current condition.It would be helpful to Chung-Myung today, but for Chung-Myung at the time, plum beds were just useless herbs that would not make him feel better.Would Chung-Myung have used plum blossoms as a hangover reliever in the past?The effect was great.'When you drink secretly and your hangover is not completely relieved by transportation, if you take a pill of plum blossoms, your stomach will be sore! It's been released. It's not worth it as Youngdan, but as a hangover reliever, the best thing in the world was plum blossoms.Of course, if Jang Moon-sa knew that, he would have followed Chung-Myung with bubbles in his mouth.So I'm going to hide my plum beds...\u2026.\"Huh?\"Stand tall.Chung-Myung's body, which was swirling, stopped.\"Getting rid of hangovers?\"His head turns to the morrow.\"Why didn't I think of it?\"Here it is! Youngdan!No, no!There will be! Youngdan!Huasan's troublemaker Chung-Myung...I mean, the former wasan's troublemaker, Chung-Myung's Youngdan!\"Sometimes bad head helps!\"Chung-Myung giggled and started running toward the prose with all his might.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His jaw, clenched in clenched mouth, bends a little.A little more.A little more.And a little more.\"\u2026\u2026.\"It was only right before he broke his neck that Chung-Myung could look where he wanted to look.A cliff that's shaved.Chung-Myung's eyes were filled with terrifying cliffs, which were endlessly high and could not be seen from the clouds.\"\u2026\u2026crazy.\"A laugh is coming out of my mouth.People living in Hawasan call this cliff a 'sweet disorder. In Hawasan, the most rugged of all the Oaks, the highest and most dangerous cliff is Dan disability here.And in the middle of this perilous cliff was Chung-Myung's search now.Hwasan's a lot of Bizzy.The most secretive of all. Very few in Hwasan as well. Only a few of them know!\"Well, I'm the only one who knows.\"At the center of this cliff is a small cave that cannot be found without climbing directly.Dan disability is a place where Mundo's light training is prohibited due to its danger. However, Chung-Myung enjoyed light-air training in the sweet disorder because he was a green frog that was not supposed to be done.Then, he accidentally discovered that there was a small cave in the middle of a sweet disorder, and since then, he has used it as a private hiding place.\"It's been a lot.\"For example, drinking alcohol to avoid the long death penalty, or biting meat to avoid the long death penalty, or taking a nap to avoid the long death penalty...\u2026.\"Long death sentence.\"Why did you keep me alive?You should've beaten him to death.As I changed my position, I could see why Jang Moon-sa-hyung yelled at Chung-Myung. If Chung-Myung was in that position, he would have beaten her to death.But now Chung-Myung wanted to beat his old Chung-Myung to death without having to change his position.\"No, you crazy...\u2026.\"I feel like my neck is going to bend.A sane man wouldn't even think of using the middle of a cliff like this as a shelter. You can do this because you're about Chung-Myung.And the damage was being done by Chung-Myung now.If it was Chung-Myung, the plum blossom inspection, it would be possible to climb this cliff with just a couple of runs, but it is impossible for Huasan's three great disciples, Chung-Myung, to climb this cliff.Why is a sweet disorder a sweet disorder?No place to step, no place to grab. How smooth the cliff is makes the viewer feel refreshed.This cliff used to be like this.This is not because Chung-Myung cut the cliff in the middle in case others find the cave.\"\u2026\u2026I've had it. Really.\"You feel like you're trying to kill yourself. Who in the world would ever experience this?\"Whoa.\"With a deep sigh, Chung-Myung soon looked up at the cliff again with determined eyes.\"But I'm coming!\"There's no back.Chung-Myung will answer if anyone asks why he climbs a cliff.\"There's a spirit tablet! d*mn it!\"If you remember Chung-Myung clearly, there are plum beds and sleds in that cave!Because that's where Chung-Myung used to sleep after drinking. It is a place where plum beds are laid down to relieve hangovers.I really didn't have a plan.'No matter how much you said you got kicked, it's still Yeongdan, but you put it in a cave to relieve hangovers. It's not the job of a sane man.But it's true that Chung-Myung now has a chance.Chung-Myung looked at Dan's disability with a determined face and turned around. Then he strode into the forest on the other side.\"Whoooooooooooooosh.Chung-Myung took a deep breath.\"No matter how much I think about it, it's crazy.\"Chung-Myung was now standing at the top of a single disorder. It came back to the opposite ridge. He had a long rope woven out of vines in his hand.No matter how many times I think about it, it's impossible to climb from the bottom of a single disorder to a cave. It's hard to climb up that shiny cliff, and it's also too high.It is too harsh a cliff for Chung-Myung, who is still only a child, to climb.But what if I go down from the top? It's a lot easier than climbing from the bottom.If there's only one problem...\u2026.\"It's about ten times as dangerous.\"Sneaking down, Chung-Myung gulped his dry saliva unconsciously. I can't see the bottom. All I can see is a cliff that has been carved and a cloud hanging in the middle of it.I stepped back still.And grabbed the heart.\"Oh, my. I'm shaking.\"It used to be a walking place like a garden, but now it's like an entrance to hell. How many people can think of walking down here with a single rope in their right mind?But there are things in the world that you want to do and things that you have to do. This was the obvious latter.\"Once dead, twice dead...\u2026. No, I die twice.\"Chung-Myung once tied the rope in his hand tightly to a nearby stone. This line is his lifeline. Pull the rope several times and take a deep breath and stand at the end of the cliff.\"Sigh.\"It's really hard to save the Hawaiian people. I don't know why I should I?\"Darn it!\"Chung-Myung, who uttered abusive language, boldly began to climb down the cliff.It was never easy to climb down a shiny cliff. It's hard to find a single finger. Chung-Myung relied on himself in a speck of dust and stuck to the wall with suction when there was no gap.Cheers pour out of Chung-Myung's mouth, who has been whining down the cliff for a long time.\"Oh, shit! If I'd known, I'd have learned how to fly!\"It's a martial arts that I didn't learn because I thought it was a catch, but it's too bad to catch it because of the situation.It was then.Crack, crack, crack!The lightly stepped stone crumbles and falls down.Talk. Talk. Talk.Chung-Myung stared blankly at the falling stone. The rock bounces into the cliff burrows into the thick clouds.And after a long time.Toeok!\"\u2026\u2026wow.\"It takes a long time to fall from here to the bottom. If it falls, there's no body left. the real thingChung-Myung, who shuddered once, gulped down his dry saliva.Chung-Myung, who was never afraid of the world's Heavenly Demon, but that's when his opponent was Heavenly Demon. Even if it's the same death, it's a no-brainer to fall off a cliff.Let's say you died here and went to the next world.How would the death penalty see him who died in a crash again? You'll be relegated from the hero who killed Heavenly Demon to the fool of the world again. It's an absolute no.\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung shrewdly began to play with his hands.At first, it was a little awkward, but after a few repetitions, it was Chung-Myung climbing a cliff like a lizard on a wall.'It must have been down there.'Chung-Myung, who was going down, frowned. There is a huge cleavage between Korea and China on the cliff.We can't go inside.It means you have to jump...\u2026.\"Whoa.\"Chung-Myung, who took a deep breath, looked down with determined eyes.\"I'm a plum blossom-\"You can't be intimidated by this!Throw yourself down boldly. At the same time, I felt my body slightly lifted up, and a cliff rushed in front of me.\"Euracha!\"In due course, he reached out and grabbed a slightly protruding stone. Chung-Myung shouted, hanging from the cliff.\"Oh, I'm shaking!\"But thanks to you, it's a lot of distance...\u2026.A stubble.\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung's head went up high. His eyes are filled with protruding stones he is holding.\"No, right?\"Crunch!\"\u2026\u2026.\"No, it's...Let me help you. You have no conscience.Crack!The stone broke in an instant. Chung-Myung's body began to fall down.\"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\"Chung-Myung desperately stirred his arms and legs in Ho Gong.What if I fall from here?'Dead. The results are so clear that there is no room for reconsideration.\"Are you going to die?\"This Chung-Myung is going to die?It was then.Tongue!Suddenly, I felt a strong shock from my waist dance, and Chung-Myung's body floated to Ho Gong.\"Huh?\"A rope came into Chung-Myung's sight.'Yes!'Tung! Tung!It takes a couple of bounces to make the movement less frequent. Chung-Myung, hanging from the rope, lamented deeply. And after a while, I burst out laughing coolly.\"A man must be prepared!\"If I hadn't tied the rope down, I would have been dead. I was not sure if it would hold up well because it was a rope made of vines, but fortunately, it seems that one of the small Chung-Myung's bodies could be maintained.Chung-Myung turned his eyes away.'There is!'Chung-Myung's eyes sparkled.I can see a bulging part not far from where he hung. There's a hideout down there where Chung-Myung used to come in and out. I guessed roughly the length of the rope, and that's what it looks like!\"Oh, God help me.\"Chung-Myung took a deep breath and grabbed the rope. For now, you have to stick to that cliff. To do that, you have to rebound...\u2026.\"Oops!\"Chung-Myung began to shake his body. At first, the rope, which had no movement at all, began to shake back and forth as it continued to shake.\"Make sure the angle is right.\"Vroom.Vroom.Chung-Myung's body, clinging to the rope, repeatedly drifted off the cliff and approached. The width is getting bigger and closer to the cliff.\"Eurachaaaaaaaaa!\"I reached out and grabbed the cliff, but maybe because the rock was so smooth, I couldn't grab it at once with just my grip.\"Once more!\"Chung-Myung kicked the cliff and floated back. Now when I get back to you, with both hands...\u2026.Knock knock knock knock knock knock!\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung's head rises like a thunderbolt. And his gaze was incredibly accurate in finding the part he wanted.The vines are half-cut and endangered.\"Ay.\"That's not true.Usually, you'll hold out until you get to the cliff, and when you get to the cliff, the rope will break...\u2026.Crack!\"...it can't be! Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"Chung-Myung's body falls down with the momentum that gave him a rebound.\"Oh, my God! I'm going to die!He was able to stay close to the cliff because he gave a rebound. Chung-Myung, who has pulled all of his strength, puts his hand into the cliff.Crunch!Chung-Myung's body crashed quickly, breaking bones lightly.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!The wrist can't handle the weight of the speed. Chung-Myung thrust his other hand into the cliff with desperate force.Crunch!But the result was the same.\"Oh, my God! It's not a reed, it's a piece of bone. It breaks so easily! You f*cking body!\"We're gonna have to cooperate to get a life!Chung-Myung shook both arms and legs desperately. It was like swimming in Ho Gong, but I was able to get close to the cliff to see if it worked.\"HaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaIf you can't get your hands done, get your whole body!Chung-Myung sticks like a frog to a cliff. Both feet scratched the cliff and hugged it with both arms instead of broken hands.\"Argh! It's hot! Oh, it's hot!\"The whole body rubs and feels the heat. But it worked in its own way. The rate of decline is greatly reduced.Now, if you find anything sticking out of here!Chung-Myung, who looked down, smiled pleased.There's no way there's such a thing as a protruding.This is a sweet spot.But I could find a better place if there was a law to die. A much safer place than a protruding stone.\"Huh. It's land.\"It's the ground.It's a quick crash.Chung-Myung's smiling body was stuck on the floor.Cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong!\"Gasp.\"Due to the recoil, the general jumps up and down to Ho Gong.Boom!Dust scatters in all directions. Chung-Myung's whole body trembled, buried in the dust that flew.\"You're... fat.\"I was able to avoid immediate death due to the slow speed caused by sticking to the cliff. However, it seems that the whole body has been destroyed. There's no place that doesn't hurt.\"Turn it off.\"Chung-Myung, who had been struggling for a long time, managed to raise himself and stared at the cliff with red spiteful eyes.\"\u2026\u2026I'll climb by all means, you d*mn cliff!\"Misreading.Oh, my chin fell out.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jaw!Chung-Myung, who reaches out his hands and grabs the floor, crawls into the cave.\"Hook! Hook! Hook! Plum Blossom Screening is crazy!\"What makes you want to live in a place like this? You've been trained in the mountains, and you've lost your head.Oh, I can check the plum blossoms.\"Oh, my God, I'm dying.\"Chung-Myung lay down on the floor. I feel like I've somehow come up to the cave, so I'm strangely about to cry.'It was a real blowout.'It was never easy to climb a cliff with both hands broken, which could not be climbed even with a healthy body. If a person had a common sense and had an idea, he would have known that he was lacking and promised a future.Unfortunately, however, Chung-Myung was a man with a brain but no thoughts.\"No! If we don't go up now, it'll take time again!\"Chung-Myung, who shouted like an excuse alone, lies on the floor with the sound of suffering again.\"Oh, my God, the old man is dying.\"No, I'm a child now. It's confusing once in a while.Still, he succeeded in making a strong rope and entering the room. If the line was broken again this time, I would have really gone to see the King of the Underworld.If so, the King of the Underworld would have had a hard time holding back his laughter.I was just glad I didn't see it.\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung, who forced himself to straighten his back, looked around.I can't see anything.I can't see anything because it's dark, not because I'm sick.\"Tsk. I think it's time to...\u2026.\"Stretch out your hand and something gets caught in your fingertips.\"Right.\"When you pull on what is held at the fingertips, the cloth lifts and brightens up inside. Looking at it shining, Chung-Myung grinned.\"Really, I didn't have a plan.\"The light of the nightlife was really brilliant and clear.You can't make a fire in the cave. Since the entrance is down, when you make a fire, the inside of the cave is quickly filled with smoke.No matter how Chung-Myung is, he can't drink in that acrid smoke. It's possible, to be precise, but why should you do such a thing, which is not asceticism?'Then you've got a nightlife liquor in you.'How much is that?'I snuck one of the prizes that came into Hwasan.'At that time, so many things came and went that it was not noticeable at all even if they did something like that. He would have vomited blood in the long death penalty and the finance ministry later to set the books.\"What can we do about the past?\"It was Chung-Myung who realized how unprepared the plum blossom inspection in the past was.Oh, that's me.I keep forgetting.Chung-Myung looked calmly inside the lit cave.\"Hmmm.\"Inside, which was neither large nor small, was a bed to lie down comfortably, a small attic, and a chest.And yet it is somewhat antique. There seems to be something about weathering over the years.\"Oh, this is how it works.\"Realization came upon me.What if Chung-Myung didn't come back to life and died, and then someone in Hawasan discovered this place a long time later? Wouldn't it have been crazy to think of it as a safe haven for the master?What if you fell off a cliff and stumbled across it?\"That's the cliff shoes. Cliffs.\"It's actually just a place where you're stuck and drunk, and it would never have looked like that to the eyes of the future.He probably did everything he could, thinking there must be a hidden secret in the cave.\"It turns out this is how all the cliff-shoots were built.\"Chung-Myung grinned and walked toward the chest. And open the lid with a feisty touch. Dust, which had been piled up for almost a hundred years, rose acridly.\"Cough! Ugh! Cough! Cough!Chung-Myung, who waved his hands and pushed the dust away, looked inside the ark.The first thing that catches my eye is a bottle of alcohol. When I saw various bottles of liquor, I drooled...\u2026.No, no, no! Drinking isn't important right now.Desperately pushing the bottle out of sight, Chung-Myung turned to a small box next to him.This is it!Chung-Myung grabs the box and pulls it out. It's a little bigger and heavier than I remember.\"Hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooah.Chung-Myung, who inhaled deeply, opens the lid of the box with a careful touch. At the same time, a deep plum blossom scent spreads into the cave.It feels like the plum trees in full bloom filled the surrounding area.Click.When the lid is completely opened, you can see a round danhwan filling the box. There is something small at the bottom of the box and five snow-white circles are placed on it.\"Wow!\"I'm so moved that I'm overwhelmed. Tears welled up around my eyes.The ones on the floor are not just buffers to protect the single ring.It's the Plum Blossom Squad.\"What a nut.\"No matter how common the plum beds were.But I can't believe they stacked it up like that. Do you mean how greedy people are to do this? If Jang Moon-hyung had seen this, he would have grabbed the back of his neck.\"But you didn't plan on it. Death penalty.\"It was Chung-Myung who made excuses for embarrassment.It's not that I didn't plan it. To be exact, I couldn't touch the Jasodan. Like the Great Hall of Sorim, Jasodan was the highest quality medicine even in Hawasan. Therefore, no matter how old he was, he could not touch it carelessly.The Jasodan is a product that can be taken out only when the medical center and the long-term writer have permission at the same time.Other plum beds can be taken as long as you are an elder. Of course, you have to be a powerful elder among the elders to touch the platform, but who is Chung-Myung? Hawasan's highest number, plum blossom screening.-Hwasan, you're the biggest trouble maker!I feel like I'm hearing voices from somewhere.\"Whatever.\"For now, it is important that we have the hospitality. With this, you'll be able to fix your body.Chung-Myung took a platform out of the box and carefully closed the lid. It used to be a hangover reliever, but if you change your position, the value of the product changes. Now, for Chung-Myung, these pills were nothing short of nothing.\"Oh, I'm shaking.\"Chung-Myung, who carefully laid the box down in the chest, looked dear at the platform in his hand.The pure scent is constantly flowing out of the white pill. The scent alone made me feel better.\"You said people don't know how precious they are when they're around.\"When former Hawasan was crossing the line of the world's most influential people, he didn't even look at the platform. The only thing that was prized was the Jasodan.Isn't that why Chung-Myung was able to take care of plum blossoms so much?It's not just Chung-Myung. Such an atmosphere prevailed within Hawasan. If it's obvious, it's of course. Who would pay attention to a lower command, when there is no shortage of better commanders?But now that I'm in this situation, I feel that Young-dan, who was nothing special at the time, is so many people.\"Oh, my God, how did I end up like this?\"I'd rather die than suffer.Chung-Myung immediately sat there with his seat turned. It's enough to lament afterwards. For now, you have to recover completely. In the meantime, it would be nice if I could build more experience.Chung-Myung, who turned on the cusp, threw a sled into his mouth. The Seolmaedan, which entered the mouth, melts without a break and crosses the throat.The pure scent spread through my mouth.But Chung-Myung began to feel the scent without a second thought.Eating Youngdan does not automatically increase its history. The energy of the Youngdan must be completely made to its own, so it can be built up.A subtle problem arises here.When you're young, you can't fully absorb it even if you eat Youngdan. This is because they lack the ability to operate energy.On the other hand, when you're old enough to handle energy?But the effect is not complete. This is because it already has a lot of history. Youngdan is a way to fill in what is lacking. It doesn't add up to what's already full.\"If the history of eating Youngdan was full, Shaolin would have chewed up ten Daehwandan and become the best in the world.\"'Like this, zero or nothing is to fulfill a poor bet. The younger and weaker the better, but on the contrary, the younger subhairs cannot fully absorb the energy of the elixir.But what about Chung-Myung?I can suck it to the bone marrow!'Here is a child who is the only one in the world who has perfect energy management.An experienced newcomer who is said to be a legend. No, he's a rookie with a great career.\"Whoa.\"The sledding squad, which entered the ship, began to run on a blood vessel.Woooowoooowoooowoowoowoooowoong.I feel a lot of energy in my body. I feel proud of the huge energy I haven't felt in a while.\"Nervous!\"Filling the power strip with energy so that it won't break through the semicircle? It's nothing to Chung-Myung now. But what Chung-Myung has to do now wasn't that simple.Incomplete birth control needs to be filled.A thick, blunt ritual becomes sharp as a blade. But Chung-Myung went further from there. Chung-Myung, who sharpened his consciousness and sharpened it like a pointed needle, perfectly controlled the energy of the sledding group and pushed it into the power failure.'Careful, careful.Smooth and delicate like a baby.In the image of Chung-Myung, who sank into the interior, his power failure emerged clearly as if he could hold his hand.But Chung-Myung's goal is not a power failure. The deepest part of the danjeon. Where there is a source that humans have held since birth.\"No, you can't!\"Chung-Myung, who was about to lead the energy and push into the power failure, suddenly returned the swirling energy.Impure.Basically, Yeongdan was made to take only the good energy of the spirit medicine that exists in the world. In other words, it can be said that the tablets were refined to extract only pure energy.However, there were too many impure parts of Hawasan's pride in Chung-Myung's danjeon. If the energy flowing in Chung-Myung's danjeon is clean water in the mountains, the energy of the Seolmaedan seems to be stagnant and rotten water.Chung-Myung made a firm decision.\"I'm taking it out!\"If the government filters out the energy of the Lunar New Year, most of its medicinal effects should be discarded. It was not an easy choice.But there's no point in accepting all this energy. Hasn't he come a long way back so far to create the most complete and perfect foundation? You can't mess things up with an urgent mind right now.'Leave the purest energy behind and throw it all away!'The energy circled around Chung-Myung's body. Then it's being shaved off little by little. The impurities mixed in the snow bed were mixed with impurities in Chung-Myung's body and escaped from the body.Soon after, Chung-Myung's body began to sweat thick and dark.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I tried to make the most of the parts I could use, but there was nothing I could use.Just as the edible parts of a completely rotten radish are cut down, it is now at the point of extracting the most gentle history of the handmade sledding group. The energy that didn't reach the standard was ventured out of the body.No one else would dare to imagine it.Isn't Youngdan basically taken to improve the history? But now Chung-Myung is spouting Youngdan's history out of his body.If those who manufactured the Lunar New Year's Eve had seen it, they would have run with bubbles in their mouths right away.\"It's me. I don't want to do this.'f*cking foundation!I've collected only gentle energy in Danjeon, but now I can't increase my history as much as I want. Even the energy of refined and refined Yeongdan is considered to be a great impurity.The essence that I picked and collected in the same atmosphere as the ocean is only a handful.Desperately leads the energy that is only a handful left and pushes it into the power strip.WoooowooowooowooowooowooowooowooowooSoon, the energy of the essence merges with the energy of Chung-Myung, who was sleeping in the Danjeon, and begins to circulate throughout the body.One week. Two weeks.In an instant, twelve spirits are formed. The body of Chung-Myung, who turned on the cusp, begins to emerge as Ho Gong.Chung-Myung's experience was out of the question, but as the energy was so pure, Hyun Sang, who transcended the amount of history, began to take place.WoooowooowooowooowooowooowooowooowooClear energy circulates the whole body and circulates again and again. Then, he began to filter out all the impure things in the body.This isn't it.'This was not what Chung-Myung intended.Chung-Myung was just trying to recover from his innocence, but his energy went beyond his will and began to regenerate the body.Both wrists that were broken quickly stick and heal. The bruises all over the body recover as if they had never been before.Falling down.The wastes that flowed out of the whole body could not wet the clothes, forming a stem and dripping down to the floor. Not only the great blood that I thought had been pierced once, but also the vein began to open wider and wider.Chung-Myung unwittingly tilted his head.'Cher...\u2026 a thousand barrels?'Baekhoe is held.The bottom.The energy, which started from what is commonly referred to as the Danjeon, opened the interruption battle at the mouth of the chest wide and now even opened the upper battle.I'm suddenly scared.Everything in the world has a stage. A child has to crawl. If you try hard, you can walk, but isn't it possible for a child who doesn't have strength in his legs to fall down and break his head?Chung-Myung was the perfect match.'Stop it...'Energy out of control doesn't know what to do. It is the coin mouth that energy goes out of control and destroys the body.This is nothing short of the beginning of a mouthful. Even if the process itself is helping the body, no one knows what the end will be.Chung-Myung tries to keep his spirits at bay. However, he rejected his will and ran to his own path.God d*mn it, listen to me! That's my energy!'Chung-Myung once again used evil. Only then does the energy falter. He seems to have realized who his owner is.But he's also for a while. The energy that was slightly wary begins to run again. Chung-Myung clenched his teeth.I'm stopping you!Even if the body is damaged by refluxing energy, it should be stopped now. It was a moment when Chung-Myung gathered all his will to suppress his energy.- So you're a warrior or a warrior?Death penalty?The voice of a long death penalty rings in my head.The voice of the death penalty?No! This is what he heard in the past from a long death sentence.- Unmanned men are controlled But those who follow the rules are left alone. Hey, dude. Where did the logic of the world come from? If you build a bank to block the running water, the water will flow over the bank.Chung-Myung's body is loose.- Leave him alone. If you leave it alone, everything goes according to the rules. Twist nature with the will of man? A fool. People are also nature. How can there be no one in nature, wide and high?The energy with Chung-Myung's permission runs through the body. The history, which had been raging, began to flow smoothly through Chung-Myung's entire body when it was released.I flow in my body. The flowing stream grew thicker and thicker, soon becoming a river, flowing through the universe called Chung-Myung.How long has it been?Open your eyes!Chung-Myung opened his eyes. A crystal clear glow flowed out of his eyes.And...Boom!\"Ouch!\"Chung-Myung, who dropped to the floor from Ho Gong, wrapped his hips around him.\"What? Why is it floating?\"I never imagined my body would float in Ho Gong. Chung-Myung rose from his seat, squeezing his tingling butt.\"Whoa, I almost died.\"It was dangerous.If it had been a little out of step, it would have been impossible or lost its life. The fact that I fell off the cliff earlier seems to be aegyo.But the price was clear.\"Hmmm.\"Chung-Myung waved his wrist lightly. The broken wrist is completely attached. Rather, it feels more solid than before it broke.It wasn't just the wrist.There's impurities left.'It was a body that was thought to have been completely washed away, but more is seen as the level rises. I brushed off the impurities left in my body once again. Later, when you reach a higher level, you will see things that are not now visible.But all this is nothing more than a secondary issue. What really changed was blood.It feels like the whole body is open.There is no blockage anywhere from head to toe. Originally, his bloodway was a small trail over the mountain, but now it is as wide as a huge pipe into the imperial palace. Adding to the lie, I feel like horses can run in blood and hawks can fly around.\"I've improved my skills.\"The strength of the body has increased. It's very encouraging considering that it takes a year to increase the history as much as nails because it only collects such gentle and clear energy.\"The sun and the earth have fully recovered.\"So to put all this together.\"The bowl is bigger.\"For Chung-Myung, the body is a vessel for his martial arts. Small dishes can only contain limited amounts. The bowl clearly grew as it crossed the new wall through the sledding platform.Right now, it's only a rat's tail, but this bowl will serve as a foundation for Chung-Myung to surpass the past.Chung-Myung had a satisfying smile.It would have been a disaster if it wasn't for the death penalty.'I don't know if I've ever learned something from dying. The words of the death penalty, which used to be considered nothing but nagging, come to a completely different meaning.I suddenly realize it.\"I was just an inspection.\"It wasn't Doin.Hawasan is both an inspection and a door. There is the identity of Hwasan. But Chung-Myung is a vague person to call himself a do-in.Will Chung-Myung really be able to bring up Hwasan?\"Hmmm.\"Chung-Myung scratched his head. This worry doesn't suit Chung-Myung.Let's do something for now.\"If it doesn't work, that's all.\"Chung-Myung swirled to the ark. Every step of the way, I was embarrassed because my body swung forward more than I thought, but in the past, I was able to adapt quickly because it was a more natural movement.Click.Chung-Myung pulled a box of snowflakes and plum blossoms from his chest and pushed them into his sleeve.\"Tsk. That's too bad.\"Now this is meaningless for Chung-Myung.He was able to reorganize his body because the energy of the sale team was a medium, not because it itself contributed to his history.Refined and refined Yeongdan is nothing more than impurity when brought to Chung-Myung's history. It'll be a little better by the time of the Jasodan, but it won't be much different.Of course, it'll help as much as a rat's tail. But it's too much of a waste to write like that. Anyone other than him would have a much greater effect.\"Sad.\"Chung-Myung smacked his lips. The situation works very cleverly.\"Ay!\"Thinking hard, he closed his eyes tightly.What would you do if you didn't already own it? It has already had an effect that cannot be seen even with ten pills.\"I'm being greedy, and I'm ashamed of my hand. Chung-Myung, let's eat as much as we can.\"Chung-Myung turns around without hesitation...\u2026.Hurry up!\"Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm!\"A couple of bottles in the chest wind around Chung-Myung's waist.This is not because I want to drink. This is due to pure curiosity about what a hundred-year-old liquor will taste like.Chung-Myung, who had finished the wine and the box, stood at the entrance of the cave and glanced back.\"I feel weird.\"It's probably because there's a trace.In the much-changed Hawasan, this cave is still the same as it was in the past. So when I'm in this cave, I feel like I'm living the time I used to.I miss it.Missing.Chung-Myung, who was looking into the cave silently, smiled and turned his head.I'm gonna have to come and see you sometimes.'I won't drink and play like before, but it's still a good place to come and rest when you feel heavy.\"Well, I won't be here very often. The past is just the past.\"It is undeniable that he was Chung-Myung, a plum blossom inspection. But now he was not Chung-Myung, but Chung-Myung, the three great disciples of Hawasan.He who is tied up in the past cannot move forward.The past is just a milestone that will lead his life to the right place.\"Sure.\"Chung-Myung threw himself out of the cave without regret.Let's go!The incomparably lighter body allowed a completely different movement when entering the cave.His feet lightly kick the cliff up and up.\"Oops!\"Jumping up to the height of three chapters several times with one leap. Chung-Myung climbed a cliff in an instant and climbed to the top.\"Not bad.\"Take a deep breath.As the fresh air at the top penetrated my nose...\u2026.\"Uhhhhhhhhhhh!I feel nauseous.Only then did he realize that his clothes were covered with thick filth from his body. Chung-Myung undressed, distorting his face.\"What the hell is this coming out of your body?\"Chung-Myung, who took off his clothes without any leftovers, sighs deeply as he lifts the clothes with his fingertips.\"Oh, my God. Nothing's going well. Where's the nearest stream?\"Once I wash these clothes, I'll go back to Wasan.Chung-Myung trudged down the mountain.On that day, all the animals who had cooled their throats in the stream had to suffer for days and days.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Through the early morning air, the three great disciples escaped the white plum and headed for the smoke ground.\"I'm wide awake.\"\"I'm awake, but I can't. I can't get rid of my fatigue...\u2026.\"\"You should have said the right thing.\"\"I've been crying all night.\"\"Oh, really?\"While exchanging idle words, the three disciples took sandbags and stonebags out of the hut set up on one side of the smoke and mirrors.\"By the way, how long do we have to do this?\"\"Well, maybe it's until I tell you to stop.\"\"Who?\"\"Don't you know?\"One person appeared on the faces of the disciples.\"Monster.\"He's gonna drown in the shit.Chung-Myung, though the same three great disciples, was already in complete control of the three great disciples.Since the training was so difficult, there were some rebellious people in between. However, even that did not come out after the last person who resisted was stuck in the ceiling of the white plum.That's it.Jo-Gol, the first rebel candidate, and Yoon-Jong, the ambassador, also train without saying much, how can they rebel against Chung-Myung?In the first place, Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong are of different degrees among the three great disciples. No one thought of surpassing them. From their point of view, Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong are monsters, but there were more monsters in the world than that.\"But isn't he a little strange these days?\"\"What?\"\"You don't look well, and you don't get training.\"\"\u2026\u2026right?\"In the beginning, Chung-Myung participated in the early morning training and bullied the three great disciples in various ways, but recently he has not shown himself.\"Maybe that's not true?\"\"What do you mean?\"\"There's a rumor that you're in the mouth of a coin.\"\"No way.\"\"No, no, think about it. You keep skipping training because you're getting skinny and unhealthy day by day.\"\"Well\u2026\u2026.\"\"Maybe he's been lazy, but he's not. Isn't it strange that a guy who's been training three times as often doesn't look like that all of a sudden?\"\"That's very plausible.\"A subtle atmosphere was formed between the three great disciples who listened to the two's conversations.\"Sure\u2026\"And someone finally brought up something that shouldn't be said.\"You don't have to train, do you?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The faces of the three great disciples are quickly hardening.In fact, it's not the same now as when I first started training. At first, I was really forced to come to the training center, and every day was like hell.But now I'm realizing that I'm getting stronger through the training. Although it was unfamiliar to practice by moving the body directly, rather than studying kendo and energy, the effect was clear.The lower body stabilized and the sword path became clear.Is there any joy in a man beyond being strong? I'm tired, but I'm learning the joy of training.However, when I heard this, my heart, which has been pressing hard, crept up my head.'You can't leave it out every time...\u2026.''No, for once...\u2026.''Actually, training is a little too much. I don't think it would be bad to reduce it a little...\u2026.'Everyone's thoughts come together.Without Chung-Myung!'The murmur did not die down until he stood on the smoke ground with training tools. As soon as the dawn training, which was taken for granted, is seduced, it becomes rather troublesome.It was Hyun Sang who couldn't help but be human.\"Look, it's not coming out again today.\"\"What's wrong with you?\"\"Isn't it worth a try?\"The final word was the final straw.In fact, there have been exactly three reasons why the three great disciples followed Chung-Myung without saying anything.One is that even if all three great disciples rush in, they are not sure that they can take down Chung-Myung. No, because I can't knock it down, to be honest.Second, Chung-Myung is protected by the white plum owner, Ungum. If there is a motive that cannot be dealt with, it should be solved through the upper line. But what's the best way to raise Chung-Myung's hand?And lastly, Chung-Myung is surprisingly reasonable. When it comes to training, evil spirits rush people, but they do not bother anyone or make them do personal things just because they have power.Thanks to this, Jo-Gol was more comfortable in terms of living than when he was disciplined by his three great disciples in the past.But now one of the three reasons has collapsed.Wouldn't it be worth a shot?''You're almost skin and bones.'\"Wouldn't we all be able to win if we all work together and fight together?\"'The determined will began to linger in the eyes of the three great disciples.Jo-Gol sighed as he watched the three great disciples buzzing around exchanging opinions.\"Death penalty.\"\"Leave it alone.\"Yoon-jong smirked.\"You'll soon find out the reality.\"It was then.Squeak, squeaking.Everyone's head turns to one side. The door to the white plum was opening. Now, all three great disciples are gathered here except Chung-Myung. That means there's only one Chung-Myung left in the White Plum.So, of course, the one coming out of the White House!The door opened wide.And the three great disciples close their eyes and turn their heads in unison.\"Oh, my God!\"\"It's blinding!\"Something brilliant is sweeping through my eyes.All the people who sneaked their eyes back toward the door opened their eyes wide open.Chung-Myung walks out. It's definitely Chung-Myung.But the visible Chung-Myung was not the Chung-Myung they saw until yesterday. I'm sure Chung-Myung is Chung-Myung...\u2026.\"What's so soft about that?'\"Your face is dripping with oil.'\"Did you pick up wild ginseng somewhere?'All three disciples doubted their eyes.I'm sure you were skin and bones until yesterday, so you didn't look strange even if you fell down and died? But Chung-Myung, now in front of his eyes, looked so healthy that he looked as if his fat was dripping.It's cracked.I'm done eating. I'm just going to train.''You had a good dream.'The three great disciples felt that their dreams had flown far away.\"Hmmm.\"Chung-Myung, who walked to the Yeonjangjang and stood in front of the three great disciples, opened his mouth in a slightly somber tone.\"Guys.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I can't help feeling sorry for you guys. In the meantime, he was not well, so he had to neglect the training of his soldiers. In response, the instructor feels responsible.\"\"\u2026\u2026Oh, no.\"\"It's all right, it could happen!\"\"We're fine! It's really nice!\"Those who felt something strange was starting desperately shouted. But Chung-Myung only shook his head with a somber face.\"No, you train so hard without me, and I didn't live up to it. This is obviously the instructor's error.\"The atmosphere gets weird.\"This can't be happening.'\"How could he say that?\"'But it's not a good situation...\u2026.\"However!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung declares firmly with his big eyes.\"You can't undo it, but you can make up for it. If you lacked training, you'd have to train more!\"\"That dog bird...\"\"Fried to death in dung water...\u2026.\"\"I'd rather kill you. Rather!\"Little swearing poured out from here and there, but Chung-Myung didn't care a wink.\"So I hope you don't forget that the future of Hwasan lies in you and do your best in training. Then first of all.\"Chung-Myung chin up. Everyone's eyes look up.I could see Yeonhwabong rising high.\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Go.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"First come, first served, half come late, go again.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Won't you go?\"At that moment, someone began to thunder out. The faces of the three great disciples, who confirmed the identity of those heading to Yeonhwabong at a formidable speed, are shocked.\"Metabolism?\"Yoon-Jong.The great disciple of the three great disciples was running toward Yeonhwabong so that the soles of his feet caught fire. Someone is chasing after it quickly.Of course it was Jo-Gol.\"No, death penalty, no loyalty!\"\"Hey, run, run!\"\"If it's too late, we'll have to go again! Run!\"Only then did the three disciples come to their senses and start running toward Yeonhwabong.\"No! How can you be like that in a day!\"\"Do they know?\"\"The death penalty! You said it was worth a shot!\"\"A good man must see his time! Now is not the time!\"\"Frozen to death! You're such a baboon!\"\"What the f*ck?\"\"Death penalty, death penalty, fall behind! Run! Death penalty!The three great disciples climbed Yeonhwabong with all their might. Chung-Myung's training doesn't end with time. You can't even eat until your quota is over. If you climb Yeonhwabong twice and fill your quota, you will have to walk with your arms, not your legs.That's why they're all running so hard!\"Ghosts are indifferent! What are you doing not taking that!\"\"You're going to be haunted!\"Everyone ran and ran in tears of blood. I don't know what it took, but Chung-Myung has no hope for them as long as he's back in shape.It was the moment when the first attempt at rebellion was neatly overpowered even before it began.Chung-Myung grinned as he looked at the back of the three great disciples climbing Yeonhwabong.\"Very cute things.\"How dare you dream of rebellion.The body, which became sensitive as it reached a new level, did not miss any of their conversations even inside the white plum.\"Well, that's good.\"Since Chung-Myung used to do that.Obedient people are bound to have limits. Such people may be preferred in Hawasan, but they are not Chung-Myung. Either he wasn't a physically challenged man in the first place.But!There is nothing uglier than that if the complainant has no skills. What a warrior needs to gain the right to speak confidently is his ability first and second.\"That skill, I'll make it for you.\"Chung-Myung grinned.It is also important to regain the past's uselessness, but no matter how strong he is, he cannot regain the past films of Hawasan. This is because the moon and blue do not depend on the power of one person.Thousands of years of Murimsa Temple.There were countless people who rose to the top of the world on their own. But their reputation may be passed on, but their successor does not leave a name in the world.In the end, in order for a literary group to continue its reputation, all of them must be strong.The reason why Sorim is called \"the first and foremost\" is not because there is a first and foremost person there. This is because Munpa-do, which has the best people in the world, cannot beat Sorim with Munpa-daemoon.Hasn't even Hawasan at the forefront of the past been said to be a disgrace compared to Shaolin?'Not this time.'Chung-Myung shined his eyes.In the past, we had no choice but to follow the ways of masters and executions, but this time we could rebuild Hawasan from the foundation with his color. It will be a difficult and arduous journey, but the end will be higher and grander than it used to be.Of course, I doubt you'll like the long death penalty of the Hasan.\"If you feel wronged, come back to life.\"Chung-Myung, who had been giggling for a long time, shouted with his hands in his mouth.\"The last one doesn't have rice today.It was viciousness that the devil would cry for.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sky is yellow and the consciousness is about to fly away. Would anyone else be chomping when he's in this situation?He struggled to raise his head and looked around.Extinction.Not a single person could stand. No, it's not that they can't stand, but they're all gasping on the floor like dead bodies. Only Yoon-jong is sitting with his butt on the floor, raising his upper body.Death penalty.Respect rose from Jo-Gol's heart.In fact, Jo-Gol is a little stronger than Yoon-Jong when it comes to skills. Jo-Gol is definitely ahead of Yoon-Jong in his sword-wearing talent and sense of victory.At this moment, however, Jo-Gol keenly realized why Yoon-Jong is a metabolite.Jo-Gol is hard to lift a finger, but Yoon-Jong, who has the same training, is still sitting still and catching his breath. This is not a matter of skill. It's a matter of mental strength.How can he not admire the death penalty for doing what he cannot?On the other hand...Jo-Gol's gaze turns the other way.\"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Sitting in Jo-Gol's eyes with bags of sand three times his size. Chung-Myung, who repeatedly stood up, came in. How fast did you sit down? I can almost see the afterimage of repeating the clerk.\"Hook, hook, hook! Why is it so light? Hey, if you're done with your training, give me your sandbag.\u2026. What? Why are you all lying down?\"\"Monster-like son of a b*tc*.\"Jo-Gol grinds his teeth to the ground.The amount of training they digested was enormous. Chung-Myung had been very determined for a few days and pushed his three great disciples beyond comparison. I'm in this situation thanks to you.Nevertheless, there is only one reason why there is no objection. This is because Chung-Myung digests five times as much as they do right in front of his eyes.Anyone who is determined and competitive cannot complain in that situation. Even if you have a lot of complaints inside, don't you have to shut up because you can see other people's eyes?But even though Chung-Myung digested that amount, he continued his training without showing any signs of hardship.\"Oh, is it already this time?\"Burst out!Chung-Myung threw the sandbags he was carrying to the floor. Then he kicks his tongue.\"It's all over the place. Hey! Kids these days don't have a big deal. It wasn't like that when I was a kid.\"'Cause you're the youngest, man?'You're the youngest. You're such a child!\"That's it for today's training. You can eat and practice in the afternoon. Those who doze off or do something else during the training session will double their training tomorrow.\"\"Devil!\"\"The Devil!\"Son of a b*tc*!I swear desperately in my heart, but no matter how Chung-Myung is, I have no talent for reading others' minds. Unfortunately.\"Here we go. Keep your training tools in order.\"The three great disciples sighed in unison as they saw Chung-Myung walking to the whirling white pipe.MeatI can see the meat.Nowadays, Hawasan is awash with money and meat every meal. Even the first time I saw them coming in and out of the restaurant, they seemed to have hired a new person.Meat is the three great disciples who used to light their eyes, but now no one has touched meat even though it has been a long time since they sat at the table.\"\u2026\u2026eat.\"Yoon-jong said helplessly, but no one holds chopsticks.\"\u2026\u2026I feel like throwing up if I eat.\"\"I don't like it.\"\"I can't believe I'm looking at the meat. It's time for me to die.\"Everyone couldn't bring themselves to put something in their mouths.\"Metabolism.\"\"\u2026\u2026why?\"\"Isn't this a little too much?\"Yoon-Jong had no answer. But that didn't mean the end of the day.\"It's... no, I mean, it's good for us to train. In fact, it's true that we haven't been focusing on training in the meantime, and I understand that it's better to train properly and get something from that time than to waste time clumsily.\"\"But?\"\"But it's too much training. There's no place in the whole body.\"The other death penalty seemed to feel the same way.\"\u2026\u2026you'll die at this rate, death penalty.\"\"It used to be a little bearable, but these days it's really killing me.\"\"When I enter the room, I fall asleep like a corpse. Every time I fall asleep, I'm afraid that I might die in my sleep.\"\"I can't hold chopsticks. My hands are shaking.\"Yoon-jong sighed.\"Tell me...\u2026.\"\"But wouldn't you at least pretend to listen to what the death penalty says?\"\"It's an metabolism.\"Yoon-jong frowned.But this is not a wrong word.'In the past, Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong pressed complaints. But now it's not just a job to deal with.Yoon-Jong was at the end of his rope, too.When fatigue builds up while training, it relieves fatigue so that the next training does not interfere, but Chung-Myung recently pushed people without giving them a chance to recover from fatigue.I feel like I'm over the limit every day. Would Yoon-jong have been afraid to go out for the early morning training?Yoon-jong glanced back at Jo-Gol.\"Walk.\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"\"What do you think?\"\"Well\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol drooled and everyone's eyes were on him. Among the three great disciples, Jo-Gol is the second only to Yoon-Jong, and perhaps more than Yoon-Jong.\"Honestly, it's a little too much.\"\"Right?\"\"It's hard for me to hold up. The problem is that the intensity is getting worse day by day. I also welcome intensive training, but this is too harsh.\"\"\u2026mmmmm.\"\"The harder the iron is, the harder it gets, but the harder the human body is to be beaten.\"\"So what do you think you should do?\"\"The problem is\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol is twitching around the eyes.\"The bird....\" No, Chung-Myung can't be unaware of this logic.\"\"Yes.\"Yoon-jong groaned.He was exactly on the same page. The training I'm doing doesn't make sense. But it doesn't make sense that Chung-Myung doesn't know that he's overtraining.Because it's Chung-Myung.\"I think we'd better hang in there for now. If nothing changes over time, we should talk then.\"\"Well, then I won't put up with it.\"When the conversation between Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong ended, they all agreed. For now, it is important that you have been told that you will protest if this situation continues.Whether the protest will work or not is another matter.\"Let's eat for now. Even if you don't go in, force it in. You have to train in the afternoon, but if you show a weak appearance, Sasukjo will beat you.\"\"Yes.\"\"Thank you for the food.\"\"Phew.\"Everyone held up chopsticks with their weak hands. Jo-Gol clicked his tongue small as he looked at the pity.\"Yes.\"Jo-Gol struggled to head to bed.I think I'm going to die like this.'It's good to wash. Whether or not his whole body was covered in dust, he just wanted to rush to his bed and stretch out, but he wanted to praise himself for washing clothes and washing his body with a desperate will.Thanks to this, the eyelids were full, and there was no strength left in the whole body. It's amazing to be able to walk.Down.Jo-Gol, who fell down on a hard bed, sighed himself.It's training when you wake up.'In fact, Jo-Gol had no complaints about Chung-Myung's way of training. I thought I could hold on no matter how harsh it was. Because in the end, all that training will make you stronger.But lately I've been a little doubtful.What if my body gets damaged first? Can the body continue this training?But even before the question deepens, there is a flood of humiliation. Jo-Gol quits thinking and leaves himself in a rush of sleep.\"Death penalty.\"\"\u2026mmmmm.\"\"The death penalty, wake up. Death penalty.\"\"Hmm?\"Jo-Gol struggled to open his eyes. A human figure enters a dim view.\"Who!\"A heavy hand presses Jo-Gol, who is about to get up.\"Don't make a fuss and get up quietly.\"\"Chung-Myung?\"\"Hurry up.\"What else did this crazy guy come into Jo-Gol's room to do this night? How did you open the door?\"\u2026\u2026what's going on?\"Jo-Gol struggled to lift himself up. I think I slept quite a bit, though, but I couldn't get rid of any fatigue. Being heavy, irritation soared automatically.At that moment, Chung-Myung offered him something.\"Come on.\"Jo-Gol frowned unconsciously when he saw a small pill on Chung-Myung's hand.\"What is this?\"\"Energy.\"\"What?\"\"Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.\"Jo-Gol, who unwittingly made a loud noise, shut up.\"It's hard to get. I'm giving it to you because I'm the death penalty.\"\"Gee, you're really good?\"\"Have you been deceived? You'll get the hang of it just by smelling it.\"It is real.For a while, a pure scent had been poking Jo-Gol's nose. Nevertheless, the reason I asked back is that I cannot believe the situation at all.What is zero medicine? It's a medicine that enhances internal performance and cleanses the body. In Gangho, the mere rumor that the best medicine is somewhere in the world spreads blood and kills a person.Even if it's not that much of a medicine, it. If there is any effect that enhances endurance, the value far exceeds the same amount of gold.But you're giving that pill to someone else?\"I'm not poisoned.\"\"No, it's not that!\"Jo-Gol took a deep breath trying to scream.\"Why are you giving this to me? Why don't you eat it?\"\"Because the death penalty needs it.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Hurry up and eat, before others know. And it's absolutely a secret that I gave you medicine. It's only for the death penalty.\"\"\u2026\u2026you.\"Jo-Gol mouthed and closed.Can I really eat this?Jo-Gol, who has been struggling with extreme tiredness, couldn't think as well as usual. Moreover, that pill seemed to be a real pill. As evidence, the tired body was reacting violently.\"Just eat it. I'll take you to the door.\"\"\u2026\u2026can I really eat it?\"\"I'm giving it to you because it's the death penalty.\"Chung-Myung bounced the pills in his hand. Before Jo-Gol could react, the pills that came into his mouth melted and passed through his esophagus.I could tell from my gut that this was a real pill.\"I'll take care of you, but don't rush into it. You can take at least a month to slowly absorb it.\"\"Oh, I see.\"\"Turn around, I'll take you from now on.\"Jo-Gol looked at Chung-Myung with slightly moved eyes and turned around to turn his seat.

I'll die like this.I'll do it.Everything.\"It was the beginning of a day that was not so different from usual, and it was no different from usual.But obviously something was different.There is a subtle force in the foot dragging like a dying sick man. And the voices complaining of fatigue were not the same as before.AndThere are unknown emotions in the eyes of sneaking next to each other.\"Well, I'm going to train hard today.\"\"Well, yes. It's hard.\"\"Yes, it's hard, but you have to work hard.\"Everyone headed to the warehouse without saying anything. Then lightly carry the training tools and go out to the curb.Whoo-hoo. It's light. It's light.'\"It looks like your body is full of energy!'\"Is it okay if I'm the only one eating this?\" I'm sorry about the death penalty.''Huhuhuh. I never thought Chung-Myung would have liked me so much. Give me that precious young man.'The death penalty is wary of the surroundings.The death penalty will be disappointed to know that I'm the only one who's been given the right word.''I'm sorry, but Young-dan is not common, and only those who want to eat should eat.'Is there anyone else who got it besides me?'Each of us was spinning our heads. Chung-Myung told me never to reveal what I ate, so I couldn't say it even by mistake.Although each other had an awkward look on their faces, Hawasan's three great disciples never dreamed that everyone here would have eaten Youngdan.The reason?It's too simple. This is because Youngdan is not a very common thing to get. It takes more than a thousand golds to get Yeongdan to feed all the three great disciples. Even if you have the money, there is no guarantee that you can save Youngdan.By the way, would Chung-Myung be crazy to save all three of his disciples? They were the three great disciples who knew that they were not worth it.\"Give me that precious young man.\"'\"Oh, my God, you're up in arms!'Moreover, those who had taken Youngdan clearly realized the efficacy of the medicine. Hot energy keeps coming up from the inside of my body.It has not yet absorbed all of Youngdan's energy, but at this rate, it is clear that fatigue will not only go away but also improve internal skills as soon as it is absorbed.My motivation comes to life and my heart beats.Tongue!Then, the door of the white plum opened and Chung-Myung walked out. The three great disciples who confirmed Chung-Myung stood close together in line.\"Well.\"Chung-Myung smiled pleasedly at the sight.All right.My eyes are sparkling. How sparkling it is, the eyes of the three great disciples shine brighter than the dawn stars seen in the sky.Why wouldn't that be the case?It is useless to take it from Chung-Myung's point of view, and it is ambiguous to bring and sell it, but it is a valuable medicine that cannot be obtained even if it is paid for from their point of view.If I had known that the Youngdan given by Chung-Myung was not made by Eo Joong-jung, but a plum blossom troupe with the history of Hwasan, the reaction would have been even more intense.Turns out he was a good guy.'Oh, it's a big distribution. The precious Youngdan.'\"Loyalty, loyalty!\"The three great disciples looked at Chung-Myung with hot eyes. Chung-Myung, who is so passionate, even faltered with embarrassing faces.So that's why the death penalty gave Young-dan to those who didn't listen.'Chung-Myung felt in his bones that dealing with people should not be done with just a whip.\"Well, let's get a clean start today.\"\"Oh!\"Chung-Myung pointed to Yeonhwabong with a chin.\"Go get it.\"\"Eurachaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\"\"I'm number one today!\"\"Get out of the way, I'm coming!\"Chung-Myung grinned at the death penalty running to Yeonhwabong.It's gonna be easy for a while.'* * *It's weird.'The eyes of the sword narrowed.In front of him, the three great disciples were wielding wooden swords as usual. It was not so different from what Ungum had seen so far.But the sharp eyes of the fortune-teller found a clear difference.The blade's stabilized.'The same swordplay is being developed, but the sharpness and stability have certainly changed.The Ungum's eyes on the three great disciples became dim.'The lower body has changed.'I can feel the strength of my feet. As the foot is tightened, the upper body does not shake, and the upper body does not shake, so it weighs on the end of the sword.It's good work.If the tip of the sword is steady, doesn't that mean you can develop the desired candle accurately? Considering that the reason for practicing and sharpening the same sword countless times was to develop it perfectly in the end, it was a great change.But there is one thing that bothers me.Is that possible in such a short time?'By calculation, they needed at least one more year to reach this level. It's a very minimal period of time frame. Realistically speaking, it is not strange at all even if it takes two or three years.By the way...\"Burn!\"The sword divides Ho Gong.What?\"Eurachaaaaaaaaa!\"The advancing angle to the floor echoes the ground.\"Huh?\"The Woongeom unconsciously burst into laughter.It is a good thing that the achievements of the disciples have increased. But I don't understand how the hell this happened.\"No way, that early-morning trainee?\"'The eyes of the sword turned to Chung-Myung, who was wielding the sword from the back.\"\u2026\u2026.\"That's all I can think of for a reason.There is no need to dwell on it. It was after Chung-Myung came that the three great disciples suddenly rose. To be exact, it was after Chung-Myung began training with his three great disciples.The gap between the eyebrows of the fortune-telling sword narrowed.'Do you mean the training works that much?'I didn't expect anything great and I didn't allow it. Chung-Myung has heard many reasons, but the reason why Ungum allowed training is because the three great disciples are willing to train themselves.Of course, there was a realistic reason why Ungum himself could secure more training time.'I just thought it'd be a good thing if I had a little more desire.'Isn't it working beyond motivation? That's also to the extreme.Moreover, the three great disciples were also engaged in training with an unmatched motivation as they realized that their skills were increasing.\"Huh.\"I feel strange.How long has it been since he ran the White Plum to see his disciples shining their eyes so valiantly.I'm ashamed of myself.I had no choice but to reflect on myself. The disciples go on training with low motivation, but did the fortune teller have such passion?Didn't you have to be bothered with the job?The crybaby sighed low. It is undeniable.'Even though I knew that the disciples were the future of Hwasan, I was negligent in taking care of his future.'The more I think about it, the more I feel ashamed. I'm ashamed of my disciples, but I can't help but think of the man who trusted him and entrusted him with this task.\"Taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\"The sword points to the sky in unison.The Ungum nodded at the sight.\"That's great!\"It was a heartfelt exclamation.\"Everyone's got the edge of the sword alive.\"I don't know what more to say. Ungum's eyes turned to Chung-Myung, who was at the back.It's a strange thing.Nothing much has changed about Hwasan. But since Chung-Myung came, something has been changing.The financial problems that have plagued Hwasan the most have also been solved, and the three great disciples are also training with different passion than they used to. Besides, can't you see that my skills are improving?Is this all a coincidence? Or...?Woon-gum, who was slightly agonizing, opened his mouth.\"You know, according to the rules, you're supposed to learn the seven-string sword beforehand. One, I can see you guys are passionate about training these days. So, if you do as you do now, I will break the rules and pass on the Taeil sword in advance.\"\"Oh!\"\"Taetaeul Sword at the White Plum!\"As the three great disciples began to murmur, the Ungold sword smiled lightly.I give rewards to those who work hard. Those who win the prize work harder. If this virtuous cycle can be achieved, these children will grow up to be prosecutors representing Hawasan.\"So don't be lazy for a second in training!\"\"Yes, my lord!\"\"All right, well, this time you're going to train a jinyuk joint.\"An energetic answer rang the smoke and mirrors loudly. The sword laughed happily.It was then.Someone comes up to the curb with a quick step.\"Do you have a fortune-teller?\"The sword who turned his head was surprised.\"Now, the long man?\"The Ungum, who hurriedly expressed his respect, looked at Hyun Jong with curious eyes. It was very rare for Hyun Jong to find the white plum's soft armour. No wonder, isn't it Hyun Jong who's under construction?\"You're doing a great job. I have a message for you. Can you spare me a moment?\"\"Yes! A long writer.\"The Ungum turned his head and shouted at the three great disciples.\"You're learning the Jinsukhap...\u2026.\"\"Make sure you're learning the Seven Hyun Sword.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Looking at Hyun Jong, who came in after cutting the horse, Woon-gum made a curious face. But he nodded, saying there must be a reason.Leaving the children behind, Ungum waited quietly for Hyun Jong's words.\"Lucky sword.\"\"Yes! A long writer.\"\"There seems to be a problem.\"\"Yes?\"Hyun Jong takes a book out of his sleeve and hands it out to Ungum. The complexion was dark. The Ungum asked, accepting the book.\"This?\"\"That's the grade from the ark.\"\"Oh....\"When Ungum, who was alternating between Hyun Jong and the book, saw Hyun Jong's chin gesture to read it, he hurriedly began to read it.\"It's a long story.Isn't \u2026 a joint right?\"\"Yes, it is.\"The dagger narrowed the middle of the forehead.Yukhap is the martial art that was the basic ball of Hawasan. But now it has been replaced by a joint venture. No longer does the right to coalesce mean anything in Hwasan.\"But why did you...\u2026.\"\"Have you seen it all?\"\"Yes.\"\"When I first discovered it, I only read it like you. It was so hectic and hectic.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes?\"\"Check out the last chapter. There's a post on the back, too.\"\"Oh?\"The fortune-teller hurried to reopen the rank. Soon, the face of Ungum, who saw the words written there, distorted mercilessly.The hand of Ungum, who held the book, trembled.Pass it on to the latter.The latter is not to blame for developing and transforming Hawasan's martial arts. Muhak must constantly change and develop.However, the meatball is the basis of Hwasan and the skeleton of Hwasan. Transforming the meatball is no different than twisting Hawasan's spirit.The latter must bear this in mind.If there is a seed that transforms the meat, it would be better to be prepared when faced in the future.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hyun Jong was looking at the distant mountain as if he had no choice.\"Meat...\u2026.\"As if my head is tangled, the situation is not organized.The meatball is the basic ball of Hawasan, which has supported him for many years. Just as those who first catch the sword learn the right way to write, and those who first learn to memorize the celestial alphabet, all of Hawasan's martial arts begin by learning the meat properly.But the years have passed and the times have changed. Hawasan is no longer able to maintain a slow burst of meat. You have to learn a little faster and move on faster.Isn't that why everyone put their heads together and invented a jinyukhap?Unlike the Jynx sword, the Jynx sword can be learned faster and practical.\"Wasn't it a conclusion that all of us need a long-term jinnyut in Hawaii?\"\"Right.\"\"But it's....\"Hyun Jong breathed a low sigh.\"That's why I'm here to hear your opinion. As you have said, it was the will of Hawasan that redefined the Jinsukhabgum as the foundation of Hawasan. But isn't what your ancestors said important, too?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The Ungum nodded unconsciously.It's not to the point of importance. The words of the good man are the milestones of the future. Every civil servant tries and tries to follow the path of a good man.But how can you deny such a clear will of the good man?\"Hmmm.\"\"What do you think?\"\"How did I...\".\"\"You are the teacher of the children of Hawasan. I can't help but consider your opinion when it comes to the ball. Don't think about anything else, just say it candidly.\"The crybaby sighed deeply.It's hard.Whether to follow tradition or choose change has always been a hot topic for people to think about. Because it is not a question with an answer.\"The reason why we created the Jinsuk Hapkam is because we didn't have much time in Wasan.\"\"Right.\"The degree takes more time after all. Who doesn't know the excellence of meat? But at that time, Hawasan had no time to slow down and raise his pupils. Can't we take a road that takes more time when Munpa might issue a signboard tomorrow?\"That's why I ask. Can Hwasan see the future now?\"Hyun Jong frowned.It was also a difficult question.'Future.'Hawasan has only solved one of the problems he has accumulated. Although the problem was the most urgent and serious one, there are still a number of problems left.\"It's not easy to answer. Understand that you cannot answer clearly.\"\"The Long Man.\"The sword opened its mouth as if it had made up its mind.\"Then I disagree.\"\"How come?\"\"Because it's not easy.\"The crybaby sighed.The jinyuk and jinyuk swords come from one root, but they are completely different martial arts. In the first place, the foundation of martial arts itself is different. If the meatball is slow and slow, but it's hard to press down, the meatball is fast, slow, and cheerful.\"Children learn fast. Already those children have accepted the pack of jinyukhap. It's hard to teach such children meat again. At any rate, there may be consequences that are neither one nor the other. Above all, a stable lower body and seriousness are needed to achieve the harmony. It's too late now.\"The sword shook its head.\"I'm sure the good man wouldn't have said anything unnecessary. If possible, I'd like to follow the good man's words. But it's practically impossible.\"\"Do you really think so?\"\"Yes, a man of long letters.\"\"What did he say was the most necessary thing to enlighten meat?\"\"Strong lower body and true...\u2026.\"The sword blinked its eyes. Hyun Jong turns his head and looks at the children who are training.\"Strong lower body?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Serious?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"That's a great training, isn't it?\"That's not what I did.That... that's what he did.Ungum's eyes reached Chung-Myung, who was swinging the wooden sword from the back.'No way?'No, it's just a coincidence.However, this is far too much. Chung-Myung is not a shaman, and how can you predict this situation in advance?\"I don't think it's that hard for these kids to learn the meat again.\"\"\u2026\u2026He, though\u2026\u2026 children will be confused.\"\"Isn't it our job to rule over the mess and lead it right, Ungum?\"The Woon Sword nodded dazedly.\"It's the children who are confused? Or is it you?\"\"Now, the long-winded man. Can I have a moment of your time?\"\"Hmm?\"\"I want to ask a child.\"\"Child?\"\"I'm not the one who learns. In order to truly know the way, I think it is better to ask the child who will learn martial arts directly.\"\"That's a good idea.\"Teaching is something that flows from top to bottom, but it is the children who accept it. It is also important what children think.\"Then, Yoon-Jong...\u2026.\"\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161!\"Before Hyun Jong could say anything, Ungum sang Chung-Myung loudly. Chung-Myung, who was wielding a rough sword, flinched and looked this way.\"Come here.\"Chung-Myung lowered the sword at the words of the Unsword and swirled along.\"Did you call me?\"\"I want to ask you a question.\"\"Yes, sir.\"The fortune-teller paused a little and opened his mouth.\"Which do you think is better, going slower but higher, or going faster and more clearly?\"Hyun Jong, who was listening next to him, slightly expressed disapproval. The question itself is too pedantic. Too much for a child to accept...\u2026.Oh, right. It's Chung-Myung.'That child certainly has a special side, so he may understand and come up with an answer.And Chung-Myung bowed his head with a deep frown. Then, he looked up and looked at Ungum, as if he had sorted out his thoughts.\"It's right to go high.\"\"How come?\"\"Because it's Hawaiian.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The sword looked at Chung-Myung with a stiff face. His eyes were twitching as if to show the shock he had received with this answer.Because it's Hawaiian.\"Hahaha.The Woon-gum turned his head and looked at Hyun Jong's face. Hyun Jong closed his eyes. I can't tell everything from the expression that was revealed, but it wasn't that hard to guess what he was thinking.It doesn't matter if the answer is right or wrong.The important thing is that the answer came from the child's mouth.'Yes, we were Hwasan.'What they lost.Proud of Hwasan.The piyeon of the distant past is now flowing out of the mouth of Hawasan's youngest child.\"If you're a decent literary person, you're right to choose the latter. But Hwasan is not like that. We cannot compromise with reality to regain the glory of the past and to make Hwasan's name known all over again.\"It was a question that didn't However, the child is answering after finding what the Ungum is hiding. It's a controversy that adults would be ashamed of.\"Did you mean you couldn't compromise because you were Hawaiian?\"\"That's what I think.\"\"I see.\"The sword nodded.\"Go back to your seat.\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung sighed as he moved away. But before he opened his mouth, Hyun Jong opened his mouth first.\"I'm ashamed of myself.\"\"Yes, Jang Moon-in.\"\"I never thought I'd hear this through a child's mouth. Huh. Because it's wasan. Because it's wasan...\u2026. Who can say such a thing in the present situation?\"Hyunjong closed his eyes.Even Hawasan's long-winded man couldn't bring it up. It's an answer that I didn't even think about. Maybe the answer was made because he didn't know anything.But the important thing is that the answer is making him ashamed of leading Hawasan.\"Hwasan. Hwasan\u110b\u1175\u1105\u1161.\"\"The Long Man.\"The Ungum said in a serious voice.\"Maybe it's the horse of a young man. But as a child, you can be impervious to reality.\"\"I see.\"\"It may be difficult. But I don't want to be ashamed of that kid.\"Hyun Jong drooled.It's not a small thing. It is extremely important to make a basic contribution.But more importantly, it's about setting direction for Hawasan. This small conversation grew like a snowball in an instant, forcing Hyun Jong to choose.The choice of way forward for Hawasan.\"Listen to the fortune teller.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Hwasan's basic ball will be returned from the Jynx to the Sixth Sword as of this time in the name of the long Hwasan.\"\"I'll follow your orders.\"\"We will officially issue an order in consultation with the elders, but the fortune-teller should be familiar with these matters before the order is officially given to the children and pass on the meat.\"\"Yes!\"The eyes of the fortune-teller became determined.Hwasan is a Hawaiian.You can't remain a half-hearted civil servant. As long as they write Hawasan's name, they should always be the best and aim for the best. Even though your body is immersed in the stream, you should always wait for the day when you rise to heaven and become a dragon.That is the duty and calling of those who write Hawasan's name.\"It's not just meat. We must reconsider all of Hawasan's martial arts. Your role as the perfectionist will be more important than ever.\"\"I'm ready, Jang Moon-in. What would you wish for if you could repay the kindness you received to Hawasan even so?\"Hyun Jong smiled and looked at the children.'These children are the future of Hwasan.'They didn't make it. Maybe it doesn't happen at all on their own. However, by the time these children lead, they should be able to re-examine their name to the world.For that, there was nothing Hyun Jong could not do. And perhaps the good men of Hawasan, who are now looking down at him from the lineage, are proud of him.Clearly\"That pathetic fellow.\"Chung-Myung, who returned to his seat, clicked his tongue.It's frustrating to see him procrastinate because he can't decide on any of these small things properly.You don't have to ask me that? Should I ask? I put rice in my mouth and they're asking how to chew it.'You die before you get sick. You die before you get sick.\"Phew.\"\"Why are you sighing all of a sudden?\"\"Do you know what I mean?\"\"\u2026\u2026What did he said.Cheung-Myung frowned, answering Jo-Gol's question roughly.'Let's be cool. These guys aren't doing anything right. I'm sure what you're doing is in tatters.'I think I should go to the harmony.I'm worried about whether the harmonious businesses will be properly organized. Chung-Myung has no choice but to take care of it properly, as nothing will work properly if left to a long writer.\"Ha, this Munpa has nothing going on without me.\"\"\u2026\u2026What is he saying, death penalty?\"\"Leave me alone, where are you going for a day or two?\"It was a moment when everyone sighed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is also natural that there are no ingredients. What? A refund? Yes. Uh...\u2026.\"Hawasan's three great disciples in white paint were dealing with the influx of guests in cold sweat.He's trying. He'Where am I, it's a chord.It was good to find the books and retrieve all the harmonious businesses. Since you've acquired more than 10 businesses that work well, isn't it just about making money?It was the beginning of all the problems that I thought \u2026.Even Chung-Myung didn't think about it, but they haven't rolled a proper workplace for nearly a hundred years. So, there was a situation where raw grasshoppers, who had never earned a penny in their own hands, suddenly had to roll more than ten businesses.The result?As you can see.\"No! It's been a while since I said I ran out of ingredients. Why aren't they coming?\"\"What the hell is re-alerting doing?\"\"What's that nut job doing holding on to a customer! Hey, hey, hey!Chung-Myung smiled pleasedly.'They're having fun.'Hwasan's disciples, who had only been wielding knives in their lives, are coming down in harmony and sweating hard to deal with customers.If the old sailors of Hwaseon saw it, sternly rebuked...No, he would have rolled over the ground with a boat.Chung-Myung is one of the students.And of course the guests didn't respond well.\"No! What kind of car is this?\"\"Give me a postcard, a postcard! Don't you know what a postcard means? Is this a postcard?\"\"There's no such thing as hitting tea leaves in a teapot! Where's the owner of this place?\"I'm alive to see hell.Chung-Myung sighed, looking pleased at the skeleton.\"Oh my gosh.\"It's better here at least.The three great disciples who have been taken to other places of business are now experiencing hell. No, people who have to take them to business are going through hell.The one who sells silk and tears it apart.He's asking for a homie, but he's coming for a pickaxe.Still, there's room for understanding for people who pick up meat to go out to the guest table while cooking. Of course I'll have to be beaten to death.The three great disciples, who only serve guests, are about to burst their heads.As people who have been polishing Donna all their lives are caught up in the secular wind, they will throw away the jegi they had in their hands.\"Hey, man! What are you doing? Don't use it fast!\"\"Yes, I do! Sweep!\"Chung-Myung's broom began to swipe in front of the polygwan.'Sweep this up and do something. All the guests are going home without anyways.'Chung-Myung's eyes saw guests storming out of the door. Now that I've seen that unpleasant face, I'm running.\"Hit them very hard!'I feel like I want to shout.Of course, I can't say that because I'm the youngest in the real world.Chung-Myung slipped back, pushing the dust in front of him with a broom. Jo-Gol, who was busy carrying refreshments, stood out.\"Death penalty.\"I'm not listening.\"Little brother.\"I'm not listening.\"Hey, hey, hey, hey!\"My ears are clogged.\"Jo-Gol, you bastard!\"\"Yes! The three great disciples, Jorge...\"\u2026. What the f*ckin' you?\"Jo-Gol flipped his eyes and glared at Chung-Myung. Even though he is not a priest, he is still a priest. The priest was talking nonsense, and the punishment...\u2026.\"Why?\"Here it is.Jo-Gol sneaked around, slipped out of Daru and approached Chung-Myung.\"Death penalty.\"\"So why?\"\"Let's have a human conversation. I heard you're the youngest son of a famous shopping mall. The youngest son of the Continental Battlefield. Something like that?\"\"The continental battlefield is freezing to death. It's just a small merchant family.\"\"But at least you'll have an eye for things to go around. That's how it is. The youngest son of a successful family is basically an immature scoundrel, but he's hiding his talent.\"\"\u2026\u2026What are you talking about?\"Jo-Gol let out a deep sigh.Anyway, I can't understand what you're talking about whenever I talk to this guy.\"So\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung pointed to the scene of chaos with a small chin.\"Why the hell did this happen?\"\"It's him\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol sighed.\"The ones who were in charge of this place.\"\"Yes.\"\"But I think they were popular. The employees quit a lot as they quit.\"\"Huh? Popularity?\"How can a con artist be so popularity. What kind of a detective duck is donating to a beggar's den.\"What do you mean by 'flesh', death penalty?\"\"To be exact, I think he was very thorough in his relationship with the delayed school relationship, rather than relationship. Most of the employees who worked were relatives or family members, so they all started to look around and quit.\"Oh my god.Is this a nuisance to family management. This is why professional managers...\u2026. No, not this.\"So it's an employee issue?\"\"That's the first thing.\"\"Huh? Any more?\"Jo-Gol frowned subtly and looked around. Only after confirming that he has no ears to listen to, does he speak down.\"As you can see, the biggest problem is that the adults in Hawasan are not capable of running these businesses.\"\"Does that require capability?\"\"People who brush the road, or people who learn martial arts, tend to see the problem of earning and living easily, but it's not as easy as it sounds. If it's easy, you'll all be rich.\"\"Well, that's true.\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply.\"So now, Hawasan is not capable of handling these businesses?\"\"It's a little too much to say, but it's a pearl necklace on a pig's neck. I didn't know it would be this bad...\u2026.\"It was then.A loud voice is heard from the inside.\"No, we don't have enough puer cars, so what can we do if we bring a steel pipe?\"\"Isn't that what it is?\"\"I told you it was a boy car! Death penalty! I'm already in a lot of trouble, what if I change my stuff?\"\"Why are you raising your voice? I've had to deal with expensive cars all my life, so I wouldn't know what to do.\"\"Who's ever had that!\"Chung-Myung shook his head.'They're wiping the road.'They are angry and fighting over the change of a single tea leaf.\"Look at that.\"Jo-Gol clicked his tongue.\"Operation is not that simple. I have to pick out everything before buying it. If you choose a good ingredient, it doesn't pay off, but if you use cheap products, customers will fall. If you hire a businessman because you can't do it properly, there's nothing left for them to do.\"\"\u2026\u2026What do you learn now?\"\"If I tell my 40-year-old men to teach me martial arts, will you?\"\"I won't.\"Jo-Gol shook his head.\"Honestly, I think if we keep this up, we'll be doomed in less than half a year. I don't know what it was like before, but now he's not capable of running it. There's no answer to this.\"\"But why don't you learn it well?\"Jo-Gol looked at Chung-Myung with vain eyes.\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161. Look, do you know the characteristics of our current businesses?\"\"Well?\"\"It's all about selling things off.\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"\"Taroo. Run. Silk statues, blacksmiths, and so on. They all get ingredients and make things and sell them. You know what's so special about this?\"\"I'm rich if I know that.\"\"It's almost everything that's at stake to pick and take things off. By the way. What do you think an innocent master would do if he brought money and tried to take it off?\"\"You'll catch a pushover.\"\"It's no use just catching a pushover. He's probably going to eat it to the bone.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"This is not going to work. It wasn't going to work in the first place.\"Chung-Myung turned his head and looked at the distant sky.And there was a big smile.\"Long death sentence.\"This priest now realizes the greatness of the long death penalty. These businesses used to work perfectly when there was a death penalty.'Era, d*mn it. I'd rather die than suffer!'Chung-Myung blew his nose.\"So what's the solution?\"Jo-Gol looked at Chung-Myung with blank eyes.\"Why are you looking for a solution from me?\"\"No! I heard your brother-in-law is still a child of a business family. Then there must be a solution, right?\"\"You crazy bastard! What am I supposed to say when I ask a first-time herbalist to cure me of a disease? If I had the ability to do that, would I be swinging a sword in Hawasan? I'm sure they're already making a fortune from their inheritance. I can't save this even if my father comes.\"\"\u2026\u2026is the situation that serious?\"\"There's no answer.\"Jo-Gol had a wry smile.\"I wouldn't have tried to contact my house. But it's too far, and my house can't afford it. In order to operate such businesses without difficulty, at least most items must be merchants with knowledge. But there is no such person in Hawaii.\"There used to be.It's Cheon Mun.But now it's gone.Jo-Gol said with a wry smile.\"If only Hwang was fine, I wouldn't have to worry about this.\"\"Hwang Dae-in?\"\"Yes. Hwang Dae-in.\"Chung-Myung tilted his head.\"Come to think of it, the man named Hwang Dae-in has often been mentioned. What does he do?\"\"It's a giant.\"\"Geosang?\"Jo-Gol nodded.\"He's one of the big merchants who works on the island. He handles not only Cheonghae, but also Unnam and Western goods.\"\"And what does he have to do with Hwasan?\"\"He's been supporting Hwasan for a long time. It's kind of a famous story. With him, Hawasan was able to stay afloat.\"\"\u2026\u2026What do you see in Hwasan?\"\"Well, that's what I don't know, but\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol shrugs.\"I heard you sponsored not only Hawasan but also many other places. Anyway, it wouldn't have been a problem if he was alone. You could have gotten a lot of advice or help.\"\"Then you can ask him for help.\"\"No, he's been in bed for a year now. There's also a rumor that he's unconscious.\"\"Hmm.\"\"So....\"It was then.\"Chung-Myung!

I thought you said, \"Don't make a fuss about everything in your life.\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply.Now I have to run errands for the kids. How did Plum Blossom Screen Chung-Myung end up like this?\"So what's going on with that errand?\"We can deliver one book to the long-term writers or the re-examination.\"\"Publishing?\"What's this call?I wanted to ask you more, but it's not polite to ask each and every circumstance of the private dormitory. It's heartbreaking to be polite to the blue guy, but what can I do? Things like this.\"Yes, I'll be there.\"\"Yes, normally you can leave it and send it to someone who's going to come back, but it's quite difficult to deal with it because it's a matter of time. I hope you understand.\"Oh my god.He has a good personality.If it was Chung-Myung, he would have wiped out his mouth as soon as the three great disciples complained.Unam took a book out of his arms and held it out to Chung-Myung.\"This is it.\"\"Yes.\"And Unam kindly explained what the book was just in case Chung-Myung wondered.\"It's a letter from the top of the galaxy, so it's valuable.\"\"Huh? The top of the galaxy?\"Jo-Gol spoke quietly.\"Hwang Dae-in's business is at the top of the galaxy.\"\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung stared at the calligraphy. Unam continued to explain whether he felt anything strange in Chung-Myung's eyes.\"It's a letter that came at short notice to a long writer. I happened to be in harmony, so I was able to receive it in the middle. It will take two days for those who deliver the goods to Hawasan, so you can go up quickly and tell the long man.\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"It's urgent, so don't delay and start right away.\"\"Yes!\"Jo-Gol, who was watching Chung-Myung, unwittingly reached out as Chung-Myung rushed to Hawaii with the book in his arms.\"Well... well!\"Then, he murmurs with anxious eyes.\"You can't send him that thing, can you?\"\"Hmm? What did he say?\"\"Oh, nothing. Sasookjo.\"Jo-Gol quickly glossed over his words. But his eyes did not fall from Chung-Myung's distant back.I'm nervous.'A sad hunch is not wrong.* * *\"Hmmm.\"Chung-Myung, who climbed to the middle of Hawasan, pulled out a letter from his arms.\"Hmmm.\"So this is a letter from Hwang Dae-in on the Galactic Battlefield?No, it's a letter from his subordinates, since Dae-Hwang said he's going back and forth in his bed.\"Ha... oh, my.\"Chung-Myung sighed wistfully.\"Isn't it the duty of the Taoist to open a letter to others, but isn't it the Tao that came into me? Everything depends on the province. It would be natural for me to want to open a book that came into my hands. Isn't it so? Capital punishment?\"- Talk like a horse. You little tiger!\"\u2026\u2026 Anyway, the death penalty doesn't suit me.\"It's been like that for a long time.But that can't help but look at this.Apparently, if the workplace is left as it is, it is obvious that it will be a mess, and if the author Hwang Dae-in steps up, it will make things easier. But in this situation, there's a rush from the galaxy battlefield?That means something happened to Hwang Dae-in's personal life.If you don't know it at all, can you not check it even though you know it? It's the same line for anyone other than Chung-Myung.I wouldn't choose, but I'd be tempted anyway.Chung-Myung took a close look at the book. The inscription \"Chinjeon\" (\u110c\u1165\u11ab\u9577\u9580\u4eba\u4eba\u89aa\u50b3\u89aa\u50b3) on the surface, which is a long piece of Hawasan, stands out.That's why you're telling me not to open it to anyone but the long-standing Hawasan.\"It's all right, it's all right. To be honest, you would have told me the news if I were here and there was a long writer. I wouldn't have told the long story.\"It was the sound of bubbles when others heard it, but fortunately or unfortunately, there was no one around Chung-Myung now.\"Let me see.\"A book sealed with wax. No matter how you tear it off, the traces are bound to go over.In a normal way.But it's not rocket science for Chung-Myung.\"Well, that's a good thing.\"Squeak.An example from Chung-Myung's fingertips accurately separates the boundaries between paper and wax. Then, only a complete envelope remained, as if it had never been waxed from the beginning.Chung-Myung, who opened the envelope and took out the book in it, opened it without hesitation and began to read it.\"Well, let's see\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung crossed his legs and began reading the book.Chung-Myung's face was distorted.Chung-Myung, who almost crumpled the book, folded it finely with a slightly shaky hand and pushed it into the envelope.And soon there was a big breath.\"Whoosh!\"After taking several deep breaths, Chung-Myung trembled as if he had not fully calmed down.\"Isn't this a f*cking Mahwa?\"Mahwa.The flower of the devil.Chung-Myung clenched his teeth.\"There's no way ordinary lawmakers can cure marijuana!\"Because it's a symptom of zero tolerance.On the surface, symptoms appear to be severe poison poisoning. So finding a cure would have had to be focused on that.However, Mahwa is a symptom that occurs when a person is subjected to a particular martial arts of Mahism.The reason why Chung-Myung can't calm down now is very simple.\"Magian bastards!'Magian people, who thought they had almost been exterminated, are working in the middle of the midfield.\"No, no, no!\"Chung-Myung slapped his cheek with both hands.\"It's Heavenly Demon that I killed, not all of the Magicians.\"It is only natural that the remnants of Magicalism remain in this era.Didn't you say that the guys who killed Heavenly Demon in the first place and didn't get wiped out came all the way to Hawaii?There must have been some survivors, and there must have been others left in the 100,000 mountains, so it's no wonder they're still in existence.The problem is they're not only alive, they're planning something in the middle.Chung-Myung's eyes shot fire.\"No, but do these bastards have any grudges against Hawasan?\"Why does everything damage wasan?How many people are there in the middle of the country? Why do you want to mess with Dae-in Hwang?\"Oh, back pain!\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply.I don't think I can do this.'I think I'll have to go in person.The contents written in the book alone cannot be confirmed as a symptom of Mahwa. It's first to see it with your own eyes.Besides...\"A reward, a great reward!\"The content written at the end of the book turned Chung-Myung's eyes neatly.As Jo-Gol said, the top of the galaxy is a cash cow. If you used the word \"tremendous reward\" in a place like this, how much would you give?\"You can't miss this!\"Chung-Myung is in a hurry.Since nearly a hundred years have already passed, not many people will know about Mahwa.If Magyo and Jungwon have not been at war with each other for a hundred years, there is no way that anyone can recognize the symptoms of being hit by a particular wave of water.And anyone who could identify the symptoms died that day at the hands of Heavenly Demon and Magician at the summit of 100,000 mountains.But what the world doesn't know.\"Some of those who survived a hundred years ago may know Mahwa.'And if he's still alive, he'll be the leader of each faction. You're still too old to be a long writer, but what if one of the long writers showed you this book to get some information?\"It's going to be a complete disaster! I can't see that!\"There was a spark in Chung-Myung's eye.How dare some insolent man eat Chung-Myung's food...Are you saying you're looking for a patient? It's money... No, it's something this Chung-Myung must solve for the sake of morality!Of course!\"Busy!\"Chung-Myung grabbed the book and reached for the seal. Chung-Myung, who had a slight burnout and melted the wax, immediately began to jump to the top of Hawasan at a formidable speed.\"Bring it to me first!\"That way, they'll figure it out even if it's settled.\"I'll eat it no matter what!\"Just wait right there.It's a long-written biography of Hyun Jong.Long winter has passed and spring is coming. By the time this book arrives, spring plum blossoms will be blooming in Hawasan, where the long man is.I can see the panorama of Hawasan, who visited with my father in the past. I'm full of thoughts to visit again anytime, but it's just a shame that the situation won't allow it.I've been so high that I'm ashamed to write to you like this, but I'm still contacting you because your father's condition is getting worse day by day.As you know, your father has been sick since last year and is in bed. Considering your father's age, it's understandable, but strangely, in recent years, other symptoms have begun to appear instead of the symptoms that old people should show.Your father is almost unconscious and unable to move. The body is dyed red, the eyebrows are black, and the veins are running wild.Our galaxy's top invited middlemen to examine your father's condition, but no one has made a proper diagnosis.So I'm going to send a letter to those who are meant to be with the feeling of catching straws to get a clue about my illness. If the long writer knows about your father's symptoms, I would appreciate it if you could contact him in any way.For those who give you information to improve your father's symptoms, I promise to repay you tremendously in the name of the galaxy.Then I look forward to a good answer.Repayment of Wang Jong, the upper-majority minority of the galaxy.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They are the Taoists who need to gain peace of mind through performance. For such people, dealing with the mundane was no comparison to cutting corners in the mountains.\"It's all good\u2026\u2026.\"Of course that is understandable.They also understand how important money is and how difficult it is to earn. Didn't you live on blood porridge a while ago because you didn't have any money?You cannot live off the bark of a tree just because you learn martial arts by polishing it in the mountains. Whether it was a mountain, a mountain, or a city, people needed money to live.So there is no complaint so far.That's not the problem...\u2026.\"Can't you just book a room for the harmony? What kind of nonsense is this?\"\"I feel like I'm going to die in the morning and evening going down and up in Wasan. Capital punishment... ...\"Yoon-jong closed his eyes tightly.It's Yoon-jong, who would usually tell him not to be a crybaby, but I can't say that now. This is because he is out of breath.\"\u2026\u2026 Think of this as a training, too.\"\"What kind of training...\u2026.\"\"Or you guys can go to the dorms and argue with them yourself.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Everyone shut up.It's not because I'm afraid of my superiors. This is because their hardships are not much compared to the hardships of the homeless.If they hold out today right away, they have yet to return to Hawaii to prepare for business the next day.\"I don't have time to train these days.\"\"We're here to learn martial arts, not trade. If I were to do this, I wouldn't have joined Hwasan.\"Yoon-jong sighed deeply.\"Everyone knows what they want to say. But the world doesn't always work the way you want it, does it? The same goes for this one. It will be solved soon, so let's endure it until then.\"\"\u2026\u2026yes, the death penalty.\"\"All right.\"Still, everyone nodded to see if it worked.Yoon-jong sighed secretly.I've said so, but when will things get better?'There is no promise.No, it is not without a commitment. In Yoon-Jong's view, things just got worse day by day, let alone getting better.It would not be strange if the merchants who sided with Hwasan this time had not helped him or her, even if they had already come to a ruined workplace.In order for things to get better, the only things that will get better must be visible, and the only things that can be seen are the bad ones.'I hope the long man has a solution.'Yoon-jong was surprised while continuing his thoughts.'I'm worried about all the things that's all.'Until some time ago, that rarely happened. Although he is one of the three great disciples, he has never worried or agonized over the future of Hawasan. Because I thought it was enough to leave even if Hwasan failed.But before I knew it, Yoon-Jong was also seriously worried about Hwasan.This is all the change that happened after he showed up...\u2026.\"Go away, go away, go away, go away, go away!\"Yoon-jong closed his eyes tightly.\"Everything seems to be a good change, but why does he seem to grow out of it day by day by day?'Yoon-jong looked at Jo-Gol running toward him with a pale face.\"Death penalty! Death penalty! We're in trouble!\"\"Take it easy. Because you're so frivolous about a man named Doe...\u2026.\"\"Cheo, Chung-Myung...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung?The moment the name came out of Jo-Gol's mouth, Yoon-Jong's face also turned white.It was great to be able to bore people before they even heard what was going on.\"Oh, no, come here! Come on!\"When Jo-Gol started running ahead, Yoon-Jong started running along Jo-Gol without saying a word.What the hell is wrong with him?'I didn't even have time to think. Yoon-jong, who ran to the mountain gate with all his might, jumped into the white pipe following Jo-Gol. Jo-Gol, who soon arrived in front of Chung-Myung's room, opens the door violently.\"You don'sorry.But there was no Chung-Myung in the room.\"Where have you been?\"\"No, that's not it! Look at that. Death penalty.\"\"Huh?\"That one?Yoon-jong's eyes slightly narrowed as he turned his head to Jo-Gol's point.Paper?There is a piece of paper on Chung-Myung's bed. Yoon-jong, who went close to the bed, read the words written in it.Something came up, so I went for a few days. You have to explain yourself. And if you skip training, you'll fold your back upside down, so don't skip it.\"\u2026\u2026you madman.\"Yoon-jong's hands trembled as he grabbed the paper.How many days are you going?What, does this lunatic think it's possible to leave the country for a few days just because he's got a job to do?\"Uh, what do I do? Capital punishment?\"Yoon-jong sighed deeply.\"For now, let the children join you.\"\"\u2026\u2026and if I get caught, I'll buy it.\"\"It's the same thing that makes you want to go and say it right away. He said he'll be back in a few days, so I'll try to hide it until then.\"If it wasn't for today, the seniors wouldn't care about the youngest of the three great disciples like Chung-Myung. If you're lucky, you'll be able to stay out of sight.\"What if I get caught...\u2026.\"\"Did you worry about that?\"\"Huh? Aren't you worried about the death penalty?\"\"\u2026\u2026\u2026I'm worried about something else.\"\"What?\"Yoon-jong sighed deeply and said.\"I'm worried about what he's going to be away for days. How much trouble are you going to make?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"It was Jo-Gol who strongly agreed with Yoon-Jong.* * *\"Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Gasp! Oh. Take a breath!\"Chung-Myung sat down on a wooden nest next to him and took a breath.I ran from Wasan to the West Bank in a single run, and I was completely distracted and my mouth smelled sweet. As expected, it seems a bit unreasonable.\"Oh, my God, I used to be like this.\"Jump over the mountain in one step, huh? He jumped the river a couple of times!It wouldn't have taken him a minute to get from Hawaii to the West Bank. It's also a leisurely walk like a walk.However, Chung-Myung did not have that ability, and he had no choice but to run like crazy, sweaty feet.\"Oh, my. If you had a glass of cold water, you wouldn't have a circle.\"It was Chung-Myung, who revealed his age that he could not hide at times like this.Chung-Myung, who took a moderate breath, looked up and looked at the West Bank.\"It's been a while here, too.\"Harmony is also an advanced place, but it cannot be compared to Seoan, a member of the island's West Sea.The West Bank was the closest metropolitan city to Hawasan. Therefore, it was the West Bank that was considered as the top priority whenever there was something to visit the city in the past.Chung-Myung got up from his seat, smacking his lips.\"There's been a lot going on here.\"Essentially, the disciples of Hawasan did not prefer to stop by the West Bank.The reason is very simple. This is because Jongnam is the capital faction closest to the West Bank.Jongnamsan Mountain, where Jongnam is located, was only about 50 li from the west coast. As a result, Jongnam's disciples appeared in the West Bank when they were bored.What if a student of Hawasan goes to the West Bank and meets Jongnam guys?One of them will be destroyed on that day.'Jong-nam and Hwasan are on bad terms.No, it's not just to say we're not on good terms. Hawasan and Jongnam are almost enemies.There are not a few literary people in the world who don't get along with each other.However, Namgung Segawa Habukpanga, famous for their bad relationship, even put their tongues up and point fingers at Jongnam and Hwasan when they see them growl.Why aren't you getting along so well?You have to bite it backwards. What's there to get along with?Just as neighboring countries do not have a good relationship in the first place, the gatekeepers attached nearby cannot get along well. For now, interests are at stake and receiving discipleship is also competitive.And above all, the only thing left to do is pull the knife as soon as you come up with a question of whether you're strong or we're strong. This is a matter of pride.In addition, Hawasan and Jongnam are from the same province. It is similar that the province has a strong temperament in the inner family, even the main martial arts is the sword.The good men who founded Jongnam and Hwasan,\"Huh. We have similar tendencies, so if we set up a clan nearby, the future will get along like brothers.'As you may have thought, the actual wives have come to regard each other as mortal enemies, let alone brothers.As a result, Hawasan was also reluctant to meet the pro-South writers, and naturally became reluctant to enter and exit the West Bank.Until Chung-Myung appeared.As everyone knows, Chung-Myung was more inclined to do what others were reluctant to do, and the more the death penalty dried him up, the more he went in and out of the West Bank.Picking a fight?Of course I got caught.Unfortunately over there.I hit him a lot.'This is an excuse, but Chung-Myung has never visited Jongnam and sold him. Chung-Myung is not such a free man. At that time, you have to rip off another piece of meat and have another drink.We don't have enough time to enjoy drinking and dancing to avoid the eyes of Jang Moon-sa, so where is the time to visit and pick a fight with such guys?However, Jongnam seemed to enjoy fighting rather than drinking and dancing. After being beaten once or twice by Chung-Myung, he used to run with crab bubbles when he heard that Chung-Myung had risen in the West Bank.Of course, I beat every inch of the way.Come to think of it, Chung-Myung was great, but Jong-nam was great, too.Chong Nam's grit is also acknowledged by Chung-Myung. This man here is a hobby, beaten to death if there is to cheomat and capsized, and if I can grab yet more snow again that ties into a screwball.Maybe that grit made him what he is now.In the midst of Hawasan's collapse, Jongnam is said to be threatening the position of the world's number one inspection.Of course, that'll be for a while.\"So, um....\"Chung-Myung glanced at his clothes.I couldn't take off my clothes because I was in a hurry. Plum blossoms embroidered on the chest are noticeable today.\"I think I'll have a bad day if I meet you...\u2026.\"Should I buy some clothes and change?Chung-Myung, who was a little worried, shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.\"No way.\"It's just that we're running into Jongnam on this vast west coast. Jongnam's eyes aren't open looking for Chung-Myung like before.\"What's the big deal?\"Once you get to the top of the galaxy, you won't run into Jongnam guys.\"That's what I eat.\"Chung-Myung crossed the gates of the West Bank with a lewd smile.Never expected how big a flat wind this would bring.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Until recently, there was still consciousness, but recently, the number of days when I couldn't wake up has increased significantly.People who are unconscious can't eat food.If these days continued, it was clear that he would be out of breath in a few days.He invited the world's greatest names out of urgency, and now he is asking for help from Kang-ho's followers, who have been associated with him, but they have not been able to come up with an answer.Today, I had a ray of hope because the characters of the Sacheondang family, who boasted the best knowledge in the world, came to Dokdo. But the situation back was enough to disappoint Hwang Jong.\"It's difficult.\"Sure enough, Hwang Jong sighed in the negative comments.\"You're saying that even the Tanga called the \"Dock Manipulation\" can't heal your father?\"\"Of course, our party prides itself on the world's best when it comes to poison. You can decode the Dokdo.\"\"But?\"\"But the eternal condition is not caused by poison.\"Hwang Jong narrowed his forehead.\"You're saying it's not poison in that situation?\"Dang Myong, the elder of the party, picked up his head lightly.\"The symptoms are similar, but they're not addictions. There seems to be a fundamentally different cause.\"\"Hmmm.\"Hwang Jong's complexion has become so dark that it cannot be darker.There is no one to cure Hwang Munnyak's illness, even though he has invited people with the financial power at the top of the galaxy and promised huge compensation.\"You're sure you're not old?\"\"It doesn't look natural.\"\"Then, what the hell is going on?\"Then Dang Myong lowered his eyes slightly as if he was in trouble.Hwang Jong sighs as he looks at his face.\"I'm sorry, I know you're not a councillor, but I'm so frustrated.\"\"I'm sorry I couldn't help you.\"\"No, forgive me for not seeing you off.\"Dang Myong got up from his seat and went outside with a wry look.\"What am I supposed to do?\"Hwang Jong clasped his head.The father's condition is getting deeper day by day, and how can a child feel when he can't do anything?\"What sin did your father commit that he would go through?'This is Hwang Munnyak, who has spent his entire life doing for the poor. I know heaven's will is not necessarily in retribution, but isn't this too harsh?Death after suffering from an unknown disease for a year...\u2026.Then there was a knock on the door.\"May I come in?\"\"Oh... Yes, Elder.\"The door opened and one person came inside. White-white was an impressive gray-haired man.\"I just saw Elder Dang Myong die.\"\"That's what happened.\"\"A small wine. I'm embarrassed to keep saying the same thing, but it's time to stop admitting it. The only way to save Hwang is through apprenticeship.\"Hwang Jong's face is slightly distorted.\"I know what you mean. But I don't want to resort to that yet.\"\"Sodan liquor. Didn't I tell you? The symptoms of eternal existence are the price of going against the flow. Too much has been collected, too much has been artificially twisted. If you put it down now and put your mind to the province, you will be able to get well.\"Hwang Jong turned his head and stared at the man.But the man nonchalantly continued, as if the look was not burdensome at all.\"It is not common for a long writer of Daejongnam to raise a ritual in person. Why don't you know that you can enjoy this pleasure because you are the Hwang Dae-in at the top of the galaxy that has been dating for a long time? I'm running out of time. Don't leave any regrets.\"\"\u2026\u2026I'll wait a little longer.\"\"Something new.\"The man clicked his tongue. It's like Hwang Jong is doing something pathetic.Wang Jong bit his lower lip slightly.The reason why we should just skip these rude words and treatments is very simple. This is because the man in front of me is Kimok Sung, the elder of Jongnam.Jongnam has been famous for his old-fashioned paintings, but he has recently gained his name in all directions due to the momentum of the Rising Sun. I don't know about this generation, but after a few generations, I'm sure it will take over the place of the first inspection. It is almost evaluated.In addition, the West Bank has long been a place of great influence of Jongnam. Such Jong-nam's elder personally recommends it, but Hwang Jong, the owner of the small group, who is not the top leader, cannot refuse heartlessly.\"You'll ask for a thousand golds in return for a memorial service.'It's not a waste of money.If he can save his father's life, it is not a waste to give up all his assets. However, if they were really confident that they would save their father as an apprentice, they would not have asked him to give up the money in advance, but would have saved his father and demanded compensation.The senses I learned throughout my life helped me understand what they were aiming for.\"I haven't received all the replies from the letters I've sent from all over the country yet. I'll decide after I get a reply.\"\"It's frustrating. How can they cure a disease that they have invited and failed to cure? Didn't you just listen to the Tanga?\"Hwang Jong's eyebrows are wiggling.He is speaking as if he had heard all the conversations between Hwang Jong and Dang Myong. You don't seem to realize it, but does that mean you stole the conversation from inside?\"Brazen.\"Hwang Jong sighed deeply.Unfortunately, he didn't have the strength to point that out now. If Huang Munnyak changes his name as it is, the top of the galaxy is bound to shrink. Then, it is necessary to maintain a relationship with Jongnam, which has a great influence on the West Bank.Maybe even at a huge cost.\"Give me a little more time. It's not because I don't believe in Jongnam. It's because I want to do one more thing as a child.\"\"There's not much time left. We must not forget that if the lord is not famous, it is the result of the vain obsession of the Sodan.\"Hwang Jong's fist clenched under the table.\"I'll keep that in mind.\"It was that moment.\"Lord Sodan!\"An urgent voice came from outside.\"What's going on?\"\"Hwasan! A man came from Hawaii.\"\"Did you just say Hawasan?\"\"Yes! It's Hwasan.\"Hwang Jong's eyes trembled a little.Hawasan is also where he sent his letters. However, since there is nothing much to look forward to in Hawaii, which has already declined, the letter to the country started at the end.Does that mean you've already sent someone even though the investigation has just arrived?'By any chance?'If they didn't know anything about Wang Munnyak's symptoms, they wouldn't have sent people in person to visit.As soon as Hwang Jong, who had a ray of hope, tried to get up from his seat, he heard a cold voice.\"Hwasan?\"Kimok Sseung's eyes are slightly aging.His expression was noticeably stifled by the mere words of Hawasan. And then there's a rough voice.\"What a bunch of screwed-up shit you' Where are we?\"Hwang Jong bit his lips a little.Of course, Kimok Sseung said it with the West Bank in mind, but Hwang Jong had no choice but to feel that Kimok Sseung treated the top of the galaxy as a male Jongnam's.\"Sodanju, you don't have to meet those things. What does Hawasan know to cure the eternal condition?\"Hwang Jong hardened his face.\"Even so, they're the ones who came after hearing from us. How can a door-to-door slapping the door?\"\"You have to listen to me.\"\"Old man.\"Wang Jong cut it out as if he had nothing to say.\"This is the top of the galaxy. Don't forget it's not Jongnam.\"\"Hmm!\"Kimok Sseung showed signs of discomfort, but Hwang Jong ignored the response and rose from his seat. Then he hurriedly opened the door and went outside.'You never know.'He failed to change the name of the world, and failed to make a sharp move in the most prestigious literary circles. Then, the answer may come from places that are not expected.Wang Jong, who came out, looked around.\"Where are the people from Hawaii?\"A quarrel answers Hwang Jong's words, bending his back.\"He's at the entrance.\"\"Did you say you had a visitor from afar at the entrance? No matter how distracted you are, how rude you are!\"In a moment, Hwang Jong's voice becomes fierce. However, instead of immediately asking for forgiveness, he glances at the entrance with his lips gently.\"I was going to take you right away...\u2026 I don't understand the situation at all\u2026\u2026.\"\"Get out of my way, I'll go see you in personally.\"\"Sodan. One...\u2026.\"Hwang Jong stepped away from his face. I don't like the ambiguous attitude of quarrels.\"Since when did the galaxy's top divide the audience according to its status?'If your father had been conscious, he would have been scolded immediately.Those who do business must work at the lowest point. Hwang Dae-in's theory was that those who share the customer's status based on their status and what they have do not deserve to do business.Those who can't help but notice it are rude to set up visitors at the entrance, saying that Hawasan's power has weakened.We need to repair the top again!'Hwang Jong went to the entrance with a resolution.Soon there is a small child standing on his or her legs at the entrance.'Well, it's the fall of Hawasan.'A white coat and plum print on its chest. Undoubtedly a disciple of Hawasan.Hwang Jong looked at Chung-Myung and said immediately.\"Saintiff, you've been rude.\"Then the young master's head slightly wobbles.\"No, well, that's possible.\"\"I'm Hwang Jong, the owner of the galaxy's top small group. It's my fault for not properly educating my subordinates, so please blame me.\"\"It's all right. I'm not here to be treated.\"That's a bit of a perverse.Hwang Jong continued, keeping a straight face.\"Thank you for your understanding. But what about you?\"\"I'm here alone.\"\"Oh, I see. Party... Yes?\"Hwang Jong raised his head.\"What are you saying?\"\"I'm here alone.\"The young master in front of me shrugs his shoulders and smiles.\"I've brought you a way to cure Hwang's illness, so show him around. Oh, and I'd like to check what the huge reward you mentioned is, is it okay?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Jong's eyes trembled.What the hell is he, man?It was the first time that Hwang Jong at the top of the galaxy met Chung-Myung, a plum blossom screening.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You're doing all sorts of things. Sodanju, I didn't tell you. I don't even need to meet the Hawaiian ones!\"It was Kimok Sseung.Kimok Sung, who followed Hwang Jong to the entrance, continues with a smile.\"What do you think that little boy knows to send him away? I don't know anything, but I want to take a step forward, but it's embarrassing to come directly, so I sent a young one. Tsk, tsk, I don't like my Hwasan, but I heard that the Hwasan man is a master, and he's always used such a cheap trick.\"Hwang Jong's face has hardened.It is almost obvious that Kimok Sseung's words contained a lot of bad feelings, but now he has no choice but to think as he said.That's not the kind of person that Hyun Jong of Hwasan's Hyun Jong Jin.'As he remembers, Hyun Jong was a man of great character even though he was a Taoist. I don't think such a person will send just one child like this to show off.But isn't that the reality?\"Did you really come here alone?\"\"Yes.\"\"\u2026\u2026You mean you sent a small stamp by yourself in Hawaii?\"A young master.Chung-Myung sighed deeply.You're treated like this because you're young.'There was a time when Chung-Myung was Hwasan and Hwasan was Chung-Myung.You'd rather die than suffer.'But I also fully understand their response. A warrior who hasn't even written the terms and conditions will come and cure the disease that even the world's masters can't help, but if you trust him right away, it's even stranger.So you need to hit some medicine.\"Did you say Sodanju?\"\"Yes, I am.\"\"I'm Chung-Myung, the three great disciples of Hawasan. I received the letter that Sodan sent to Hwasan well. I came here because I had a hunch about the symptoms written in the study.\"\"One here alone...\u2026.\"\"It was a very urgent matter, so I couldn't afford to come with others. Isn't he in critical condition?\"By the way....Hwang Jong, who was looking at Chung-Myung with a face that he couldn't trust at all, recalled a part of Chung-Myung's words and hardened his face.\"Did you say you had any idea about your father's condition?\"\"Yes, I am.\"Hwang Jong clenched his fist unconsciously.I'm the first person to say this.'So far, numerous people and masters have visited, but no one has discussed the tax increase before seeing Hwang in person.'Maybe?'At that moment, I heard a snort behind my back.\"Oh, my God, he's already cheating. How can a child know what the world's masters couldn't do? Sodanju, there's nothing more to hear! Let's go in, you don't have to waste your time.\"\"One\u2026\u2026.\"\"Do you believe him in small wine?\"Hwang Jong bit his lips a little.Then, Chung-Myung, who was still listening, opened his mouth.\"By the way.\"\"Huh?\"\"Who are you? You've been lucky with people.\"Kimok Sung looked at Chung-Myung with blank eyes.\"Did you just say that to me?\"\"Is there another one here besides you?\"\"Huh, did you see this prick? Does that mean a disciple of Hawasan can't even tell Jongnam apart? I knew that Hawasan was such an idiot, but I didn't know that even his pupils were so stupid.\"\"Oh, you're Jongnam.\"Chung-Myung shrugged.\"No, I thought you were a senator, because you sound like you know something. So you have a way to cure Hwang's condition?\"\"Hwang Dae-in is ill because he went too far. If you raise an apprentice who relieves heaven's anger, you can get well.\"Chung-Myung rolled up the corners of his mouth.\"Oh, that's possible.\"Hwang Jong's face is distorted.However, Chung-Myung's words were completely different from Hwang Jong's expectations.\"Then we'll have to call the shamans and the poor.\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"\"You're the expert, aren't you?\"Kimok Sseung said with a slightly flustered face.\"Well, you don't have to. Isn't Jongnam here?\"\"No one knows Jongnam or Hawasan, or half of the inner house, is mixed in that direction. If you were going to raise me, you'd rather get it from the right masters. I would recommend a shaman. But the shaman eats the most in the province.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Jong's face went blank.Who the hell is this guy?'He even sneaks into Hwang Jong's ear.\"The shamans tend to value face so much, they'll come as soon as they're properly treated. If you want to get it, you have to get it at a good place. In a good place. In a cost-effective place.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The flushed-faced Kimok Sung let out a shout.\"Gal, he's making fun of you! That's what they teach you in your private life?\"\"Oh, yes, yes. I'm sorry.\"Chung-Myung picked his ear and blew his mouth out.It was a blatant disregard, but Kimok Sung could not do anything but shake with his hot face.It's an indefensible disgrace to be the elder of Jongnam and beat the three great disciples of Hwasan's Isn't it something that everyone in the world can point fingers at?I don't know if he knows that, but he's a real nerve wrecker anyway.\"Sodanju, kick him out now!\"Hwang Jong sighed at Kimok Sseung's words.\"Older, this is not Jongnam, this is the top of the galaxy. It's up to me to decide how to treat the guests who came to the top.\"\"How can you say that when you see me being beaten by that child?\"Hwang Jong ignored Kimok Sung and looked at Chung-Myung.'You seem to have faith in something.'If you've been scamming without anything, you can't be this confident. But it was still doubtful.\"Painthouse.\"\"Yes.\"\"It's not that I don't trust the small stamp...\u2026.\"\"It's okay, you might not believe it.\"\"\u2026\u2026thank you for your understanding. Can I ask you a few questions first?\"Hwang Jong's words have become short. Chung-Myung also felt the fact, but he shrugged his shoulders as he understood the suspicions.\"Yes, by all means.\"Wang Jong gulped down his dry saliva and went on.\"Saintiff, you said you had some idea about your father's condition a little while ago, but could you hear a little bit about it?\"\"It's hard to say.\"\"Hehe!\"As soon as Chung-Myung finished speaking, there was an exaggerated snort of Kimok Sung. Hwang Jong also showed signs of embarrassment.\"I can tell you something else instead.\"\"What is it?\"Chung-Myung said with a confident face.\"I heard that you often went up, didn't you?\"\"You're right.\"\"Then I'm sure you've stopped by 100,000 mountains up the road before you got sick. Isn't it?\"Chung-Myung spoke as if to declare.Then Hwang Jong opens his eyes wide and answers.\"No, I don't.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung's head slightly turns sideways.\"What?\"\"Never have. My father never went up there.\"\"\u2026\u2026Oh, really?\"Chung-Myung's face is embarrassed. Chung-Myung quickly continued, before Hwang Jong's expression became more glum.\"I'm sure you've been attacked before, haven't you? Or you've been through a crisis!\"\"Your father has not been attacked in recent years. It was at least five years ago.\"\"Oh, you can't do that. Oh, my God.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Jong's eyes narrowed.\"Really? That can't be true.\"I think I can hear Kimok Sung's low laughter behind his back.\"That's weird, so where did he get shot?\"What's wrong with you, you freak!Is he out of his mind?It was a moment when the expectations of Chung-Myung disappeared neatly. Hwang Jong's eyes got cold.Chung-Myung said in a hurry.\"Well, wait a minute. I'm telling you. I can fix it.\"\"\u2026\u2026a small stamp.\"Hwang Jong sighed deeply.And without missing the moment, Kimok Sung stormed in.\"Didn't I say there's nothing to look at? Hawasan is essentially a charlatan. I think you can guess just by looking at the situation like that.\"\"Please refrain from saying too much, Elder.\"Hwang Jong, who dissuaded Kimok Sung, opens his mouth while watching Chung-Myung.\"I understand the will of the little master, but your father is so ill that it's just right for the poor to get worse. I hope you understand my position, too. I'd like to thank the long-term writer of Hwasan for his care.\u2026.\"\"My body turns red, my whole body gets cold. If you press it with your hand, the redness turns slightly white and quickly turns red again. Until I lose consciousness, I feel the chills as if I'm in an ice cave, and not only the middle of my forehead, but also the back of my neck and the top of my head are black!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"More?\"Chung-Myung grinned.\"Well, how do you do that?\"Hwang Jong's eyes were so big that they couldn't get any bigger. Chung-Myung's face has become more confident than ever.\"Oh... I'm a little thirsty after a long trip.\"\"What are you doing, cold water, or ice water! Right now!\"The quarrel couldn't answer and ran inside with all its might. Hwang Jong's eyes and attitude toward Chung-Myung changed suddenly.\"Not like this, but inside.\"\"Ha ha. You got a great guy.\"\"Come on, come on!\"Chung-Myung inflated his stomach and followed Hwang Jong inside. Kimok Sung, who was watching the situation, shouted urgently.\"Sodanju, it's just a typical symptom of people who've been affected by the p*n*s. It doesn't make any difference if you know it!\"Hwang Jong opened his eyes slightly.\"Do you mean that those who have been affected by the sound gather black energy on the top of their heads and on the back of their necks? Why hasn't he been able to cure your father until now?\"\"\u2026\u2026it is.\"\"This is the work at the top of the galaxy. I won't allow any more interference than necessary. If you interfere more here, we will also officially protest against Jongnam.\"\"Hmmm.\"Kimok Sseung groaned and stepped back.Chung-Myung's face, whose cheeks were swollen to hold back laughter, came into his eyes.\"Well, I... That guy!\"Kimok Sseung felt a sudden increase in fever all over his body. I was going crazy with anger, but what can I do? As Hwang Jong said, this is not Jongnam but the top of the galaxy. No matter how old Kimok Sseung was in Jongnam, he couldn't be arbitrary to the top of the galaxy.\"If you don't treat Hwang properly, I'll strike you!\"Hitting at Wang Jong and Chung-Myung, who never stopped walking, was all he could do.As the distance grew further away, Hwang Jong said with a wry smile.\"I'm sorry. Sowon. Strangely, Jongnam can't hold back their excitement whenever we talk about wasan.\"\"It's all right.\"\"Oh, please understand...\u2026.\"\"Who's to blame? It's all my sins.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes?\"Chung-Myung shrugged.'Shouldn't have beaten him up enough.'It was the moment when the perpetrator 100 years ago felt guilty to the victim 100 years later.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And that straw is Chung-Myung. My eyes are full of determination to not let Dae-in Hwang go if he fails to fix it.Chung-Myung smacked his lips.\"Let's start with the vein\u2026\u2026.\"\"Come on!\"\"...okay. Don't rush me.\"Chung-Myung turned his head and looked at the bed. There is a person lying in a thick silk blanket.\"Well.\"Chung-Myung, who confirmed the face of the lying person, narrowed the forehead slightly.I think it's definitely a symptom of malignancy.'You need to look more closely to be sure. Chung-Myung got close and pulled the blanket out.And I frowned unconsciously.I'm wearing clothes, but I can't hide my skinny body.The old man, who had dried up like a throat, was barely breathing as if he were about to break.It's worse than I thought.'Chung-Myung touches his chin.Mahwa is a Mahwa, but it's not the right one.'If you've been hit by a high-quality macho, you can't last a year. Even those who have been working hard all their lives couldn't last three days when Mahwa came.This is not a symptom that an old man can endure.Then...\"I'm going to have a hard time.\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung reached out and grabbed Hwang's wrist.Then push the energy in slightly. When Chung-Myung's innocent history enters Dae-in Hwang's body, the tableware filled with anger and retreat.It's clumsy.Chung-Myung narrowed his forehead.The symptoms are certain to be a malignancy. But surely, it's not a symptom of well-cooked macho.Chung-Myung, who had taken his hands off Hwang Dae-in's body, fell into agony with his chin on his back.Hwang Jong couldn't hide his nervousness when he saw Chung-Myung like that. If a person with a vein takes his or her hands off and makes a serious look, anyone will feel the same way.Eventually, Hwang Jong, who couldn't resist, opened his mouth.\"\u2026\u2026how do you like it?\"\"Eh, so...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung scratches the back of his head.\"Is it difficult?\"\"No, I don't think the treatment itself is that difficult.\"\"As expected. It's okay. Everyone...\u2026. What?\"Hwang Jong's body trembled.\"What are you saying\u2026\u2026?\"\"Treatment is not that difficult.\"\"Well, are you sure?\"\"Yes, but I can't touch it right now. I need to prepare a few things.\"\"When it comes to preparation, what...\u2026.\"\"First of all!\"Chung-Myung said with a grin.\"Let's eat first.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chop, chop, chop, chop.Chung-Myung's mouth shreds and cuts everything that comes in. Hwang Jong looked at the scene with completely absurd eyes.He has also seen many provincial people while having relationships with various civilizations, but I assure you that he has never been such a good meat-grabbering monk.Even now, the long torn duck legs were sucked into Chung-Myung's mouth and disappeared as if they had been there.It's not just him.I'm the best.As soon as the glass is filled with expensive Yeontaeju, it is urgently poured into the mouth.\"Growl! This is it! This is it's it!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"I've never had such a good drinker before.If the situation had not been like this, Hwang Jong would have laughed, saying, \"I met a very pleasant master today,\" but the current situation has prevented him from laughing.\"Well... .. a small stamp.\"\"Huh? Why?\"Chung-Myung, who has a lot of meat in his mouth, asks back. Hwang Jong took a deep breath and calmed himself down.\"What is the... preparation for treatment?\"\"I'm doing it right now.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"Oh, well, it's nothing.Chung-Myung puts down his chopsticks.\"It takes a lot of physical strength, so it's important to eat well. But Sooksu is a good cook here.\"I'm sure he'll do well.He's the best old man in the West Bank.\"I've only eaten something that wasn't even a meal in Hawaii, and now I feel better.\"Chung-Myung tapped on the stomach.\"Have you finished?\"\"No, it's just the beginning.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Is there a monkfish in your stomach?Hawasan said things are tough these days, but he seems to be quite hungry...I mean, even if you're starving, does it all fit in your stomach? I'm sure human ships are limited in size.He was a master who surprised people in many ways.\"I don't think you're here for dinner.\"\"Well, it's not just for the record.\"\"But it has its own purpose.\"\"He who wipes the road, lives by the flow.\"\"It's going too fast...\u2026.\"\"I'm keeping it in moderation.\"How can I?Hwang Jong couldn't overcome the frustration and sighed.\"It's not that I don't know it's against the law to rush a small stamp who's come a long way. But shouldn't the small stamp count the feelings of the son whose father is bedridden?\"\"I've had enough to figure it out.\"Hwang Jong jumped out of his seat.\"Hey, little seal, my father!\"\"I'm not dying.\"\"\u2026\u2026what did you just say?\"\"I'm not dying. Have a seat.\"Chung-Myung poured the drink casually and drank it down.Hwang Jong's face is completely unperturbed by his angry look.\"I've done some work a while ago, so you're not going to die. I just need a little time to complete the treatment, but I'm over the hump.\"You treated him?When?\"There's a saying that the more urgent you are, the better. It's not that important to cure the spirit now. What's really important is why Young-Jon the ground.\"\"\u2026\u2026are you sure you're cured?\"\"Have you been fooled?\"Chung-Myung shrugs.\"If you're suspicious, go to eternity. I'm sure the blackness between the eyes has disappeared.\"Hwang Jong stared at Chung-Myung and nodded.\"I don't doubt my little seal. I think everything should be clear, so I'll check it out right away.\"\"Sure.\"Hwang Jong quickly went outside. A little while later, he burst into the door and looks at Chung-Myung with incredible eyes.\"What the hell did you do?\"\"I treated him.\"\"When on earth?\"Chung-Myung did not reply and pointed across from me with a nonchalant face.\"Are you not going to sit down?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Jong looked at Chung-Myung with suspicious eyes.I've seen a lot of human beings in my life as a merchant, but I'm pretty sure I've never seen anyone like this before.You can see a child's hitting moment by moment, but sometimes you can feel a very old and experienced.It's like an old man in a child's body.'That can't be the case, which means that this child has experienced countless things that aren't suitable for his age.Can I trust you?'But there is no way not to believe it. As he confirmed, Wang Munnyak was clearly showing signs of recovery.Chung-Myung poured alcohol into the glass and opened his mouth whether he knew Hwang Jong's complicated thoughts.\"If you don't want to sit down, stand up and answer. I have a few questions...\u2026.\"Hwang Jong sat down again.\"Who is closest to eternity?\"\"Did you say you were the closest person to her?\"\"Yes, the one who guarded around Hwang Dae- A man who follows everything from bed to up. Or at least someone who wouldn't be suspected of doing anything.\"\"\u2026\u2026why do you ask?\"\"Let's just say it's necessary for treatment.\"Hwang Jong tilts his head and says.\"Of course it's me. It's my job to serve your father.\"\"Except for you.\"\"If you leave me out...\u2026.\"Hwang Jong, who was deeply agonizing, shook his head.\"I don't know. My father used to do so many things. So, of course, the number of people who took care of your father is not small. There are at least five people who meet the standards that the small stamp says.\"\"That's more than I thought. Hmm. You're saying that's what you're saying.\"Chung-Myung scratches his cheek like he's in trouble.But soon he shrugged and smiled.\"If there are five of them, it's not easy to find them.\"\"What the hell do you mean you'really?\"\"You're not asking because you don't know, are you? Come on. Don't tell me.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Jong hardened his face.Of course, I'm not asking because I don't know. I just don't want to admit it.\"Do you mean the thorax is inside?\"\"I thought I was out there, but looking at Hwang's details, I don't think he was out there. I think it's the work of an insider.\"Hwang Jong's face is stiff.\"Keep your tongue to yourself. The Six Souls at the top of the galaxy are like family members. I've been with the galaxy all my life, and I'm telling you that's all. They... ...\"\"Or not.\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"Chung-Myung tapped nonchalantly on the stomach.\"If you don't doubt it, you're lucky. Isn't it?\"\"\u2026\u2026that's true.\"Chung-Myung yawned droopily.\"So don't worry. It'll all come out if you look into it.\"Hwang Jong nodded heavily.Looking at Hwang Jong, Chung-Myung kicked his tongue.'How naive is a merchant.'Few people know as well as Chung-Myung how toxic a person can become.He watched the monk preaching mercy wake up a person's head and go berserk, and also watched the Taoist figure think about how to cut a person's throat more neatly.Human beings are ambivalent beings.You can be a good man to someone, but you can also be a bad man to someone.'Well, that's not the point.'What's important is that there's a man inside this galaxy who tested Hwang Munnyak.In terms of condition, it is clear that the clumsy man who mastered the macho continuously spilled the maggi on Hwang Munnyak. At first, there would have been no problem, but after a long period of steady exposure, he suffered from marijuana.Even if you know a certain amount about Mahwa, you will not know how the symptoms originated unless you have seen it with your own eyes and experienced it with your body like Chung-Myung.\"You must have been a good old man.'We got lucky.If Chung-Myung didn't see the content of the book...If Hwang had not been interested before \u2026, Hwang Munnyak was destined to suffer and die.'Oh, this is good deed.'Save people and make money.Ditch and go...\u2026. Oh, crayfish is not very good.\"But what are you going to do about the investigation?\"\"I'm doing it.\"\"\u2026\u2026Hmm?\"Wang Jong asked back with a blank face.\"You're investigating?\"\"Yes.\"\"Eating food is an investigation? Do you have a long history?\"\"No, that's not it. I'm talking with Sodanju in my room. That's what I'm investigating.\"Hwang Jong tilted his head. I just don't understand what you mean.\"Just keep watching. Funny things are going to happen soon. You just have to keep an eye on it. Oh, there's one thing you need to do for me.\"\"What's that? I'll give it a try.\"Chung-Myung picked up a bottle of liquor next to him.\"One more bottle.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Hurry up.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"A deep depth came into Hwang Jong's mind.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If these disciples have done anything wrong, please scold them sternly.\"\"It's not your fault.\"Kimok Sseung slipped away the breakfast table with a slightly irritated face.\"I can't stand the sight of a man hanging around the top.\"Then, Isong Baek, Jongnam's great student, asked back quietly.\"Do you mean the child of Hawasan?\"\"Hmmm.\"Kimok Sseung didn't speak Katabuta, but no one knew what this uncomfortable cough meant.\"I don't quite understand, Elder. What's so great about just a kid coming...\u2026.\"\"It's not about being a child.\"\"Sure\u2026\"\"Hwasan's child is the problem.\"His students looked at Kimok Sung with faces that they didn't understand at all.What do you mean by \"Hwasan's child\"?They couldn't quite understand the hostility towards Hasan, who sometimes saw his superiors.\"Didn't my sister tell you? Hawasan and we can't live in the same sky.\"But Kimok Sseung was different.He grew up hearing countless stories about Hawasan from adults in Jongnam in the past. How hard it was for Hwasan to make Jongnam suffer, and how hard Jongnam had a time under the pressure of his energy.\"It's annoying that Hawasan's child came into the West Bank proudly, but why is the name like a plum sword that's not cool to chew?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The disciples exchanged glances slightly.'That's why.'\"The Plum Blossom has been dead for almost a hundred years and it's still being talked about.'I don't think the Hawasan guys remember the name Plum Blossom, but how can we hear more Plum Blossom than the investigations of the time?'Plum Blossom.Plum Blossom Screening Chung-Myung.People in Jongnam don't add \"Zone\" to their past names when referring to Chung-Myung. You can't dare put such a precious letter on a man who won't be able to chew it.Isong Baek brings together the eyes of the priests.Anyone can see that Kimok Sseung's obsession is abnormal, but even so, Kimok Sseung is the elder of Jongnam and the adult they are now supporting.And Kimok Sseung is a very normal and gentle person if nothing comes out of the story of Hwasan.\"Don't worry.\"\"Don't worry?\"Kimok Sseung's eyebrows went up.\"The child is now going around the neighborhood trying to cure Hwang.\"\"Haha, you don't think...\u2026.\"\"They say there's a way forward.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Isong Baek shut up.Kimok Sseung did not say more, but the intelligent Isong Baek was able to guess from the meaning behind the words.What if he really treats Dae-in Hwang?It's a mess.'Hwang Dae-in is a man with a clear silver lining. Such Hwang Dae-in cannot just leave Hwasan, who saved his life. I'm sure he'll do his best to support Hawasan, both materially and physically.We have to stop him.'Isong Baek, who quickly rolled his brain and finished calculating, coughed slightly and opened his mouth.\"Elder, if it bothers you, why don't we kick him out?\"\"You guys?\"Kimok Sseung opens his eyes slightly wide.\"Yes, it would be a bad thing if the elder came forward in person, but we are the disciples of this university. Why would it be such a flaw for Jongnam's great disciples to share the sword with Hwasan's three great disciples?\"\"Well, wouldn't it be said that you persecuted a child?\"Isong Baek grinned.\"Who doesn't know that Hawasan and Jongnam have been in contact for a long time? If your hands were a little too much while comparing each other's swords while you happened to meet each other, it wouldn't be too flawed.\"Kimok Sseung nods slowly.\"Moreover, the Jonghwa branch is just around the corner, so it will be more justifiable.\"\"I see what you mean. One, I can't allow it.\"Kimok Sseung said firmly.\"Even so, he is one of the three greatest disciples. It is not up to Jong-nam's prestige that you use your hands or ask him for a dagger. How would the powerful see persecution of the child of Moonpa, who is going to collapse?\"Isong Baek holds the charges.It is none other than Kimok Sseung who cares most about the child. It was hard to bear the charges because he was saying such obvious things.However, it would be the reason why he became a disciple to understand the heart of such a smiling man.\"Then I understand that you are not allowed. But if one of the disciples makes a mistake, if he gets a reasonable punishment, he will stop.\"\"Of course, I will punish anyone who touches the child.\"\"I'll keep that in mind.\"Kimok Sseung is a man of his word. So it must be true to say that punishment is a must.Just one thing.With the bee, it was clear that there would be a bigger prize than the bee.\"It is the discipleship to follow the words of the four gates. But isn't it also the right thing to do to relieve the uncomfortable feelings of a young man? We'll take care of the rest of the work, so please don't mind the elders.\"\"Well, go ahead.\"\"Yes, Elder. I'll leave now.\"Kimok Sseung nodded without an answer, and his disciples took a deep bow and left the room.Kimok Sseung looked at the scene and frowned slightly.'These kids think too much of Hwasan.'I understand.By the time those children were born, Hawasan had already leaned back completely. In their heads, Hawasan is just an old tree collapsing with past glory.But Kimok Sseung knows.How powerful was the old Hawasan.Although Jong-nam is now famous for his inspection of the world, the good people of the temple Kimok Sseung saw as a child were never below Jong-nam's level now.No, there was definitely a better side to it.Such a past stallion also failed to dance in front of Hawasan. Had it not been for Hwasan's influence to decline due to the invasion of the Magical Church, Jongnam would not have been able to surpass Hwasan until this moment.'You can never go back to those days.'Kimok Sseung's face looked determined.\"It's safe to think that he's back on his career, seeing that he's gone all the way here from Hawaii to here.\"I thought it was completely trampled so that he could never stand up again, but he also seemed to have seen too easily of Hwasan's capacity.\"As soon as this is over, I'll need to talk to the long man.\"Kimok Sseung's uncharacteristic ferocity was young.\"Aren't you being too sensitive? Capital punishment?\"\"He's always like that when we talk about Hwasan.\"\"No matter how hard it is. It's too much to be wary of even that little kid. No matter how long ago Hawasan was a civil servant who fought for the best in the world, isn't it just a rumor that's ruined and has no pillar roots left?\"\"And so is he.\"\"And even if the old Hawasan comes back, it won't reach the present Jongnam.\"Isong Baek smiled broadly.\"He has a good spirit. But I agree with the elder. Hawasan of the past is by no means an easy-to-see literary group. Now Jongnam-do has a bit of a lag to Hwasan in those days.\"\"The death penalty!\"\"One, the past is the past. After all, those who survive are the strong ones.\"Only then did everyone nod.Go Hwi, a priest of Isong Baek and a great disciple of Jongnam, has alluded.\"But the death penalty. What are you going to do with the child?\"\"Shouldn't we send them in a reasonable way?\"Isong Baek holds the charges.persecuting a child is against Isong Baek's s*xuality, but it was also a problem for Elder Kimok Sung to keep the child here when he was angry.Kimok Sseung is not going to have to touch the child himself, but it's not good to see a person who is about the elder of Jongnam playing catch with a child.\"But what in the world did Hawasan think he sent the child alone? Isn't Jongnam a child who wouldn't have been allowed to go outside the prose alone?\"\"Not all literary circles can be the same. Wouldn't there be a reason?\"\"Well, I'm sure things aren't so good in Hasan.\"\"How do we know what the Thamunites do?\"Isong Baek blocked the nonsense.\"All we have to do is do what we have to do what we have to do. Don't forget that what we have to do now is to take care of the elder.\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"\"I'll keep that in mind.\"Only then does Isong Baek nod his head still.\"How am I supposed to summon him...\u2026.\"\"Hang on, death penalty. Look over there.\"\"Huh?\"Everyone's head turns to one side at a person's words.\"Isn't he the one?\"\"You're right?\"\"He's coming this way?\"\"Hmm.\"Isong Baek let out a grin.I was thinking about how to call out Hwasan's child, but why isn't he coming to where they are?\"What do you say, right away?\"\"You don't have to drag your feet.\"Isong Baek took a step forward toward the upcoming Chung-Myung and took a swipe.\"How are you?\"\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung looks at Isong Baek and other disciples and tilts his head.Before Chung-Myung even opened his mouth, Isong Baek immediately started.\"I'm Isong Baek of Jongnam. It's a pleasure to meet your student of Hawasan.\"\"Oh, yes. Hello.\"Chung-Myung answered in a vague way.Isong Baek asked with a patient and gentle smile.\"Where are you going?\"\"I'm going to the Great Hwang. I want to see if there's any improvement.\"\"Oh, I see.\"Isong Baek holds the charges.'You have a lot of nerve.'Kimok Sseung and Hwang Dae-in, who never changed the name of the world. I didn't think such a child could do anything about such a great Hwang Dae-in. Nevertheless, seeing that he shamelessly says that he is treating Hwang Dae-in, he doesn't seem to have a good heart.\"If you're not busy, why don't you have a word with me?\"\"Yes, well, go ahead. May I help you?\"\"Haha. It's nothing else. Hasn't Hwasan and Jongnam developed by exchanging swords with each other since ancient times? Even now, Hwasan and Jongnam hold regular sword exchanges events. Do you know?\"\"Oh, really? I didn't know. It hasn't been long since I started in Wasan.\"\"I thought so.\"Isong Baek grinned.'If you know that, you can't keep your head up in front of me.'Even though the name Jong-nam came out, there is no change in the child's expression. If you've ever seen Jonghwa Branch, you'll never get a face so calm.\"Hwasan's sword is a great help to carry out. What do you say? Would you like to give me a tour of the high-altitude sword of Hawasan?\"Isong Baek has a slight smile on his face.I'm sure you'll say no, but how many ways does he have to tie this child...\u2026.\"Oh, I mean.\"At that moment, Chung-Myung slightly tilted his head.\"Let's fight?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Isong Baek clears up his voice.\"I'm not saying let's fight. I'm either training or...\u2026.\"\"That's what we'really?\"Isong Baek's eyes go blank.What is this, man?Chung-Myung smiles at the blank stare.\"I'll take it any time. But don't regret it.\"It was a calm declaration.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did you just say regret?'He's a child without fear.'The usual Isong Baek is not a person who judges an opponent by age or status. But this young student of Hwasan was too self-indulgent to be self-indulgent.Even if you don't know how cool it is.'He is not old enough to know exactly the difference between his own and others, and decide what to say or do. I understand that far.But how can such an attitude come out when the inspection of the Tamun faction, which is at least one head bigger than himself, asks for a dagger?'Let's think it's bold.'Isong Baek sighed slightly and went on.\"Are you willing to accept the obligation?\"\"Yes.\"The answer is also too calm.Isong Baek finally opened his mouth with a heart of generosity towards a child.\"May I ask you a question?\"\"Doho is not here. My name is Chung-Myung.\"\"Chung-Myung, Chung-Myung\u110b\u1175\u1105\u1161.\"The reason why I asked you again is simple.\"Hey, Chung-Myung stamp. Let me give you a piece of advice. Chung-Myung may think there's nothing wrong with it, but it's not just his fault. Let's stop to Hawasan before we see the bigger anger...\u2026.\"\"Don't you fight?\"Isong Baek flinches.Chung-Myung yawned as if he was bored and stretched.\"It looks like Jong-nam is fighting with his mouth. Why would you talk to me without a good knife?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Isong Baek grinned.'My discipline is still lacking.'Seeing how much I want to beat this rattle up.\"There's no need to rush me. I'm thinking about starting right now.\"As Isong Baek grabbed the sword, Go Hwi grabbed Isong Baek by the sleeve.\"Do you intend to do it yourself?\"Isong Baek looks back on Go Hwi.\"You don't have to come forward. I'll do it.\"\"No.\"\"Death penalty.\"Isong Baek says with determined eyes.\"There is a minimum courtesy. But since I am the oldest among them, wouldn't it be a shame for him to fight me?\"Eventually Go Hwi sighed and backed away.Anyway, the death penalty is too obvious.'Personality alone is more than enough to be a great disciple.\"Jongnam's Malhak Isong Baek wants to paint the sword of Huasan's student Chung-Myung.\"\"Oh, wait a minute.\"\"\u2026\u2026what else?\"Chung-Myung pulled his head out and looked at Go Hwi.\"Let me borrow your sword.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Go Hwi's eyes were wide open.'I can't believe you asked me to lend me your sword. Still, how can a disciple of a mastermind have such a hair style?'The first thing you learn when you go into the inspection is not to hand over your love and sorrow to others. And you have the audacity to hand over the sword!\"Do you mean that the disciples of the inspection don't carry a sword with them?\"\"Well, did you think there would be a fight?\"\"Hwasan is...\u2026.\"\"If you don't like it, drink it.\"Chung-Myung looked around.\"Let's see, something to use as a sword...\u2026.\"Isong Baek frowned.\"Give it to me.\"\"The death penalty!\"\"Do you want to hear that Jongnam's disciple persecuted a disciple of Hwasan, who was not even stabbed?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Go Hwi sighed at Isong Baek's words. Soon after, he untied the sword with his waist and threw it at Chung-Myung.\"Thank you.\"Chung-Myung, who holds the sword, digs the sword in one hand and looks at Isong Baek with his dim eyes.\"Let's get started, shall we?\"\"\u2026\u2026you don't want to vote?\"\"It's nothing to kill. You don't have to pick one. You can pick one.\"Isong Baek closed his eyes tightly.It's Simma. Simma.When I'm talking to this guy, I feel like the discipline I've been doing is disappearing quickly.Isong Baek, who closed his eyes and took a deep breath, took a sword.Originally, I was going to scare him away, but I don't think that's enough. Apart from personal ill will...\u2026.\"As far as I can tell, he won't listen to me unless everything is broken.'It was Isong Baek who accurately determined Chung-Myung's personality in a short conversation.\"Hold the sword.\"\"Yes, well.\"Chung-Myung lifted the sword with a big heart.Looking at it, Isong Baek slightly narrows his forehead.\"You'd better do it right. It's too late for me to swear.\"\"Excuse me.\"\"Hmm?\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply.\"Let's be quick. You're gonna be up all night. Bring it on.\"\"\u2026\u2026Ee!\"Isong Baek's face is finally filled with aging.\"I'll fix your habit!\"Eventually, Isong Baek, who threw everything, flew straight to Chung-Myung.Screaming!Jongnam's sword is simple and clear.Each place, which is located in the middle of Gupa and famous for its inspection, has a distinctive characteristic. The shaman's sword is soft, Hawasan's sword is splendid, the mucous black speed, and Jongnam's sword is serious.A heavy sword, excluding all changes and tricks, is struck at Chung-Myung's neck.Chung-Myung lifted the sword lightly and blocked Isong Baek's flying sword.Whoops!The detection and the detection collide, creating a sharp metallic sound.\"Ta-ha!\"At that moment, Isong Baek swings his sword again to aim for Chung-Myung's side.Fast and strong. Even if there is a chance to counterattack, you won't dare to counterattack the sword's momentum, which splits the waist in half.Whoops!And again, Chung-Myung pulled down his sword to block Isong Baek's attack.He hesitates.Chung-Myung can't handle the heavy weight and takes a step back.Isong Baek, who grabbed the vessel, swung his sword and began to drive Chung-Myung.\"Whoa.\"Go Hwi smiled leisurely as he watched the match.\"The death penalty must be quite upset. You don't seem to want to end it easily.\"\"Yes?\"\"He did scratch the insides of the death penalty a lot. Tsk, tsk. I know. You have to look at people and joke around.\"\"Are you scolding him now?\"\"Yes, I can finish whenever I want, but don't you think it's fitting? Maybe the kid who's blocking the death penalty now is dying.\"Sure enough. Chung-Myung kept faltering back.At the sight, Wihan Su tilts his head.\"Don't you think you're blocking it too well for that?\"\"That's the great thing about the death penalty. What would you say if the death penalty knocked him down in one fell swoop?\"\"Oh....\"\"I'm trying to figure out the limitations of that child in an instant and push it with enough strength and speed to barely block it. I didn't hit a single one, but I'm teaching you enough.\"Go Hwi shrugged his shoulders.\"That's too big a lesson for a cheeky kid. That kid needs to know that. Don't miss the death penalty, either.\"Yes!\"Go Hwi bit his tongue.I can't believe he's so angry. If I were you, I'd be angry. I hope the death penalty doesn't get too excited.'But contrary to the appreciation of those behind the scenes, Isong Baek, who attacks, was a pain in the ass.Whoops!\"Stop it again?\"to be weirdIt shouldn't be blocked.Contrary to Go Hwi's remark that he was playing with moderate strength and speed, Isong Baek was now at his fastest pace.\"Why is this blocked?'The ghost was going to freak out.Chung-Myung's sword is never fast. It was a sword that was slow and suffocating.But with that movement, it's incredibly blocking Isong Baek's sword.The slow sword preoccupies where Isong Baek's sword will go and waits leisurely.Does this make sense without being in my head?'Can you read the kendo?No, it's not that level.Even if the sword was read by a young disciple of Hwasan, it would not be possible in common sense.To stop his sword with that slow sword, as soon as Isong Baek shook it...\u2026 No, you must read Isong Baek's thoughts and move the sword before you can shake it off.How can such a thing happen without Chung-Myung being a ghost?\"Taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\"Isong Baek threw up a shout and shook his sword hard.No matter how well I looked at the child in front of me, I wonder if there were only fifteen children. By age, he is only his youngest brother. However, such a child is blocking Isong Baek's sword without showing any signs of difficulty.His sword, which is one of the most famous items in Jongnam!'This can't be happening!'Isong Baek's sword has begun to carry his strength.Obviously, the beginning was light, but the strength of the sword, which he did not know, is getting stronger.Claw claw claw claw clawing, clawing, clawing!A gale gushed out of the sword.Whoops!However, Isong Baek's kendo, Chung-Myung's sword, could not be pushed back.wallThis is a wall.No matter how much you struggle, you can't get through it. It's like a wall made of male steel.\"Gain!\"Isong Baek swung the sword as hard as he could.\"Hey!\"When Go Hwi saw the wind coming out of Isong Baek's sword, he shouted without realizing it.\"Don't get carried away by the death penalty!\"Go Hwi's shrill voice was clearly heard in Isong Baek's ears.\"Oh, what did I do?\"Isong Baek quickly recovered the history of the sword. The heavy spirit disappears and a sword that is only fast hits Chung-Myung's sword.by the wayWhoops!Suddenly, a sudden binge of drinking broke out and bounced back like an arrow shot by Chung-Myung's body.\"Huh?\"And get stuck in the wall as it is.Cooooong!Shaking. Shaking!Chung-Myung has a web-like crack on his wall. Soon, Chung-Myung's body slides down to the floor.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Isong Baek opened his eyes wide.\"The death penalty!\"Go Hwi came running frightened.\"What have you done to the child?\"\"Oh, no, I...\u2026.\"I'm sure it's lost its history.Even if I swung it with all my might, I couldn't even get a scratch. But does it make sense to fall off while trying to stop a sword without bearing?It was that moment.\"Growl.\"Chung-Myung, who collapsed on the floor, crumbled and suddenly began to pump blood out of his mouth like a fountain.\"Gasp!\"\"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\"Everyone freaked out and ran to Chung-Myung. Only one person, Isong Baek, stood blankly with a haunted face.\"Pooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Blood fountains soar up and down.Wow...... blood can be spewing out of a person's mouth like that.It's obviously my fault. Anyone can tell.\"The death penalty!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"I'm going crazy.Isong Baek couldn't figure out what was going on.\"Crack. Crack.\"Chung-Myung's mouth is dripping with blood like blood. No matter who looks at it, it looks like he's severely injured. It doesn't seem strange if you lose your breath like this.It was the moment when Isong Baek came to his senses and ran to Chung-Myung.\"What the hell are you doing?\"Everyone's eyes went back to where the sound came from.Isong Baek had no choice but to close his eyes with a grim face.With a face full of anger that had never been seen before, Hwang Jong was staring at him with a shaggy beard.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Turn it off.\"\u2026\u2026.\"What is needed in this case is an excuse, but the blood fountain from Chung-Myung's mouth is burying all the excuses they have to make.In this situation, even if Zhuge Liang's grandfather, not Zhuge Liang, comes, he will not find an excuse.Hwang Jong saw Chung-Myung lying on the floor and threw his face out.\"Councilor, bring him in now! There will be a member of Parliament who hasn't left yet! What are you doing?\"\"Yes, Lord Sodan!\"One of the servants carrying out Wang Jong rushed to the outer circle. Wang Jong immediately strode to Chung-Myung, who was lying on the floor.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jongnam's disciples make way for hesitation.Hwang Jong's face, which looked at Chung-Myung's condition with his knees on the floor, was filled with indescribable anger.\"But those who claim to be prestigious!\"The faces of Jongnam's disciples quickly darkened at the words of Hwang Jong.\"You're still using this spray on a child? I thought Jongnam was a consultation text, but how am I supposed to understand those who are doing this in front of me?\"Isong Baek's face turned blue.I can't believe I can're alive.He had never used a spray.I've even recovered my history!'Isong Baek was still standing stunned. But there's only one thing I'm sure.Hwang Jong's excuse will never work based on his expression and eyes.At that moment, a servant who went to a foreign hospital ran with the lawmaker. Gentleman, as soon as he saw the situation, jumped on Chung-Myung without question and started a vein.\"Hmm!\"Gentleman's face hardens.\"Come on, get him inside! Come on, be careful, be careful, be careful, be careful!\"Upon hearing that, Jong-nam's disciples came up to hug Chung-Myung.\"Stand down!\"Hana Wang Jong wouldn't allow them to touch Chung-Myung's body. Hwang Jong, who stared at them with his eyes young enough to live, called the servants.\"What are you doing? Didn't you hear what the congressman said?\"\"I'm sorry, Sodan!\"Servants rushed in and carefully hugged Chung-Myung. Blood from the mouth moistens the chest and falls long to the floor.\"Be careful, be careful!\"Gentleman sticks close to Chung-Myung's side and heads for the women's quarters. Only Hwang Jong and Jong Nam's disciples remained there and looked at Chung-Myung being moved to the main quarters.When Chung-Myung's appearance disappears, Hwang Jong turns his head.\"I'll never forget what happened today.\"\"Lord Sodan!\"\"Get out of the top.\"Isong Baek's faces turned pale.The top of the galaxy is also an important place for Jongnam. Isn't that why Jongnam's elder came down here himself?If their fault causes their relationship with the top of the galaxy to go awry, the aftermath won't dare them.As soon as Isong Baek was about to say something, he heard a clear voice.\"What the hell is going on?\"It was Kimok Sseung. There was a curious look in his eyes.\"Sodanju, what the hell is going on? That blood... ...\"Kimok Sung, who was about to say more, shut up for a moment.The heavy blood and broken walls on the floor gave us an idea of what had happened here.\"You stupid bastards!'Kimok Sseung's eyes are on his students. Kimok Sung sighed loudly as he looked at his students who looked away without facing him.\"Sodanju, I think there's been an accident...\u2026.\"\"Did you say it was an accident?\"\"\u2026\u2026small wine.\"\"A man who was treating his father was killed by his disciples. Can you call this an accident? An accident means something that happens unintentionally. Isn't it so?\"Kimok Sseung turned to Isong Baek.It is Isong Baek who committed the crime, so he should take care of it himself.Isong Baek, who grasped Kimok Sseung's intention, bit his lips and took a step forward.\"Sodan, I think there's a misunderstanding.\"\"Misunderstanding?\"Hwang Jong is laughing his head off.\"Instead, curse at me for being blind. I've seen it with my own eyes, I've heard it with my own ears, what kind of misunderstanding is there?\"\"I've never overdone. There's some kind of mistake...\u2026.\"\"Hey.\"Hwang Jong glares at Isong Baek with his cool sunken eyes.\"What's wrong with overworking? Why did you, Jongnam's disciple, wield a sword at Hwasan's child in the first place?\"\"It was a legitimate obligation.\"\"Bimu?\"Hwang Jong grinds his teeth.\"Although I am not familiar with the laws of the strong, I heard that Bimu is meaningful in sharing martial arts among the equal. You're saying you're working with a child who could barely have lived half your life? Is that Jongnam's agreement?\"No one could open their mouth.If the rain had ended without an accident, there would have been something to avoid. However, no words can avoid responsibility as long as the result is out like this.\"I won't say much. Take your disciples and leave the top.\"\"Beef, small wine, let me tell you...\u2026.\"\"I told him to leave.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Jong stared at Kimok Sung and opened his mouth.\"I'm not going to make an issue out of my relationship with Jong-nam. But now I don't want to see the faces of the deaf. Please leave here within today. This is what I'm talking about as a small group owner at the top of the galaxy and as an assistant manager.\"Kimok Sseung eventually nodded slowly, unable to say anything, under the influence of the spirit.\"I will. Sodanju, please remember that Jongnam is hoping for Dae-in Hwang's recovery despite the unfortunate accident.\"\"Sure, I don't think anyone is.\"Wang Jong turned his body around to make the cold wind blow and headed for the hug. Kimok Sung, who had been looking back for a long time, slowly turned his head and shot Isong Baek.\"Elder, I'm...\u2026.\"\"I won't say much. You said, \"Broken,\" so stay here, by all means seek the forgiveness of the Sodan-ju, solve the problem, and return to your home country. I'll take the children back to the main mountain.\"Isong Baek's face turned pale.In this situation, how can I ask for the forgiveness of the minority?This was disciplinary rather than an order. But looking at Kimok Sung's cold expression, I can't say anything else.\"\u2026\u2026okay.\"Kimok Sseung stared at Isong Baek for a long time without saying a word and turned around.\"Going back.\"\"Yes, Elder.\"His students were quick to catch up with Kimok Sung after reading Isong Baek's mind.Watching them move away, Isong Baek bit his lips.* * *\"How are you feeling?\"\"\u2026\u2026it's not very good.\"\"Hmmm.\"Hwang Jong's face turned dark at the words of the Chancellor. The Chancellor looked at Wang Jong's complexion and continued.\"The senator says it's a dangerous situation because the blood is completely muddy. I'm trying to control my blood, but I can't guarantee a full recovery.\"\"Does that mean there's no harm to life?\"\"I think so.\"\"That's a relief.\"Hwang Jong breathed a sigh of relief.What happens when a disciple of Hawasan dies at the top of the galaxy to a disciple of Jongnam?I don't even want to imagine it.Moreover, Chung-Myung came to the top of the galaxy to treat Hwang Dae-in. Of course the fault lies in the apocalypse, but the top of the galaxy will also be unavoidable.Moreover, personally, it was intolerable for Wang Jong.Chung-Myung is the only person who has ever improved Hwang's condition. Perhaps it was the only hope to save Hwang Dae-in.To attack such a man and make him unconscious...If there was any respect for the galaxy's top and Hwang Munnyak, it wouldn't have been possible.Jong-nam has become so arrogant.'If this was the case, there would have been a little room for understanding. However, considering Jong-nam's attitude and Kimok Sung's words and actions, it was no longer possible to trust them.Hwang Jong, who coughed several times with discomfort, looked up and looked at the general general.\"So when do you think you'll come to your senses?\"\"At least a couple of days...\u2026.\"\"Well, I hope your father's condition doesn't deteriorate in the meantime.\"Hwang Jong sighed deeply.I thought I'd finally found a way to fix him, but this nonsense is happening. The sky is indifferent, too.The general general, who sneaked into Hwang Jong's complexion, carefully opened his mouth.\"One, Lord Sodan.\"\"Hmm?\"\"Can he really cure Danju's illness? I don't trust you at all.\"\"There's no harm in believing, is there?\"\"That's true, but...\u2026.\"Hwang Jong said firmly.\"Nobody in the crowd has figured out what your father's illness is. But Hawasan's small stamp found out his condition without even looking at his father. Didn't you even show enough improvement to see with my own eyes?\"\"Yes.\"\"It's not a vague belief without a basis. Heaven is helping us. Anyway, you'll have to make sure that the small paint shop doesn't have any trouble recovering. Don't spare any support.\"\"I'll keep that in mind. Then I'll leave you alone.\"\"I know.\"The general bowed his head deeply and rose from his seat.\"Hmm.\"Hwang Jong sighed low as he watched the general general leaving the room.* * *Bird's love.Bird's love.A low, feeble breath came out of Chung-Myung's bedridden mouth. A pale face without blood was now showing how precarious Chung-Myung's condition was.Breathing is about to break, but it barely continues. It wouldn't be so strange if I lost my breath right now.Bird's love.Only a short, low breath filled the room. At the time of the strange silence.Click.The door opens very slightly with a small sound.And then nothing happened for a long time.I think it's about half a meal.Squeak.The door began to open carefully.Before long, a person sneaks in. It was a prudent move that didn't even make footsteps. The room was stained with clear darkness, so it was impossible to recognize who was coming in.A person who sneaks into the room like a cat looking for food looks down at Chung-Myung from the bedside.Bird's love.Crying like a lot.Chung-Myung, who continues to breathe with a pale face, catches his eyes.After looking into Chung-Myung's face for a long time, he slowly raised his hand.His fingertips turn dark black as if he were covered with ink.\"I don't have a grudge, but think it's a price to disturb my work.\"A low mumbling man strikes Chung-Myung's black-colored hand at his neck.At that moment.Splash!Chung-Myung, who was lying unconscious, suddenly pulled back his blanket and jumped up and grabbed the man's wrist.\"Gasp!\"Chung-Myung, who had a parched complexion, opened his eyes.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Soon there was a strange smile around Chung-Myung's mouth. As evil and triumphant as ever.\"I got you, you son of a b*tc*!\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The wrist-grabbing beast tried to pull his hand out with a bewildered face, but Chung-Myung could not have let go of it gently.\"Hey!\"The pleural fluid quickly raises the other hand and tries to hit Chung-Myung. But at that moment, the door opened wide and brightened up the area around the room.It was Hwang Jong.That's it's byeok.He walked in with a stiff face and opened his mouth in a heavy voice.\"What the hell are you doing there? General?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Bonja Bok (\u5b50\u670d)), the superintendent of the galaxy who held Chung-Myung's hand, looks back embarrassed.\"Cow, Sodan!\"\"I'm asking you what you're doing.\"Bonja Bok distorted her face.\"I'm just trying to figure out how the paint works.\u2026.\"The answer to that came from Chung-Myung, not Wang Jong.\"Oh, you're gonna check and kill me?\"Chung-Myung waved the hand of the Chancellor he was holding.\"There's some kind of misunderstanding.\u2026.\"\"Misunderstanding? I like misunderstanding, too. Yay!\"Chung-Myung jumped to his feet.Bonja Bok looks at Chung-Myung with big eyes.\"Boo, I'm sure you're seriously injured...\u2026.\"\"It must have been a misunderstanding. It's this normal.\"\"\u2026\u2026I was unconscious.\"\"Oh, I haven't slept well lately. It's been a while since I slept well.\"Bonja Bok gnashed her teeth.\"You fooled me.\"\"You can't say that. You have to insist that it's a misunderstanding. If you say that, it'll show that you've decorated something.\"\"Lee!\"Bonja Bok hit Chung-Myung with a left-handed left field. But Chung-Myung neatly escaped the hand and jumped off the bed, letting go of Bonja Bok's hand.Then I walked towards Wang Jong without looking back.\"Look, you said you'd come out, right?\"\"\u2026mmmmm.\"Hwang Jong nodded with heavy eyes.\"I was half-hearted about what you said, but I have nothing to say about it. Of all things, the Chancellor who I most certainly didn't believe was a felon.\"Hwang Jong's eyes glaring at Bonja Bok were freezing cold.Seeing that look, Bonja Bok realized that no excuse was meaningless. He stares at Chung-Myung with a stiff face.\"How did you doubt me?\"\"I didn't doubt it.\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"Chung-Myung shrugs.\"I never guessed who the scar was. I know I've only been here a few days. I thought he would come to kill me if I pretended to be able to heal him roughly and lay down in my wounds.\"\"\u2026\u2026what if I didn't come?\"\"I have no choice but to come.\"Chung-Myung smirks.\"It's hard to kill the first one, but it's not that hard for two people. And if you kill me now, you can lay the blame on Jong Nam, so why would you miss that opportunity?\"\"You kissed Jong-nam in advance, didn't you?\"Chung-Myung looks at Bonja Bok with a sour face.\"No, I don't.\"Bonja Bok's distorted face suddenly went blank.\"\u2026\u2026no?\"\"Yes, they're just picking a fight. I was thinking about how to solve this problem, but it made the situation. Thankfully.\"Bonja Bok bit her lips.\"Internal injuries! I don't know about anything else, but the congressman said he was hurt to the point where his wits were strict!\"\"If it was hard to fool an ordinary congressman, I wouldn't even start. You keep asking me obvious questions.\"Chung-Myung shrugged.\"I think you have a lot of questions, but it's not important to answer your questions. The important thing is that you were set up, and I found a pleural fluid that killed Hwang Dae-in.\"\"Hahahaha.\"Then all of a sudden Bonja Bok smiles and turns her head and looks at Hwang Jong.\"Sodanju, don't tell me you believe him?\"\"\u2026\u2026is there anything I wouldn't believe?\"\"You don't sound like a bright little wine. Isn't there something important missing in that kid's logic?\"\"What's important?\"Bonja Bok nods her head.\"Yes, the fact that I tried to hurt that child is no evidence of involuntary harm. Why would I do such a thing? How much has the landlord done for me? That's why Sodan didn't doubt me either, right?\"\"Hmm.\"Hwang Jong was drooling.It's an obvious excuse, but it certainly wasn't wrong.\"Then why on earth did you want to kill the small stamp? Why hide the fact that you've mastered martial arts?\"\"Isn't he misleading the small wine? Even the great masters failed to fix Danju. By the way, how can he fix Danju?\"\"Then you should have convinced me!\"\"If I persuaded you, would you have heard? I'm out of my mind. Other than a seduced man never listens to others! Killing him and killing him was the only way to bring the small wine to its senses! That way, I can continue my treatment for Danju!\"For a moment I heard a murmur.Hwang Jong turned his head away.Each of the servants, who gathered after hearing the disturbance, was talking with mastery. General Bonja Bok seemed to be saying that he was not so wrong. I couldn't hear the sound of words, but the gaze and expression were.As such, Bonja Bok's words were convincing.\"Are you done talking?\"But then Chung-Myung took a step forward, breaking the ice.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Bonja Bok stares at Chung-Myung.\"It's true that I tried to kill you, but I've never harmed Danju. You, too... ...\"\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\"Chung-Myung shakes his hand lightly and cuts Bonja Bok off.\"No, no, no. I don't want to know why, and I don't want to hear excuses. Why bother doing such a thing?\"\"What\u2026\u2026?\"\"You'll just have to beat him!\"Before anyone could stop him, Chung-Myung flew quickly toward Bonja Bok.Then, aim for his head and stretch out the excellence.Chung-Myung's hands emit intense light with a crackling sound. Bonja Bok, who guessed the power in the flying hand, stretches out against Woosu and blocks Chung-Myung's hand.Argh! Argh!Both hands cross each other and Chung-Myung retreats.\"Now, pay attention!\"And lift the superior water up.\"Well, that one!\"Everyone who saw his hand stretched out doubted his eyes.The black handprints near Chung-Myung's wrist are so clear. The handprints turned white and disappeared, and soon turned Chung-Myung's entire wrist red.Chung-Myung slowly opened his mouth as everyone watched the scene with bated breath.\"It's called a dagger.\"Chung-Myung waves slightly. As if everyone should look straight.\"The man hit by the sweet horse that rose to the stage could not stand a single meal and died with his whole body dyed dark red. Of course this guy's isn't that bad, but it's not too much to kill. It's easier than easy, especially if your opponent is an ordinary old man who hasn't mastered martial arts.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"As soon as Bonja Bok, who was struggling, tightened his neck, Chung-Myung beat him without giving him a break.\"If you are the only one who can continue to inject short-horse power without any doubt, I believe you are not the criminal.\"The horse was the decisive blow.There is anger in the eyes of those watching. Don't you call it a hundred-and-a-half sight? No one here would trust Bonja Bok's words more than her own eyes.The change in Chung-Myung's right hand is too similar to that of Hwang Dae-in, who is now bedridden.\"Hey, hey, you ungrateful son of a b*tc*!\"\"How dare you kill Dan-ju and then do the act of a general!\"\"I wouldn't want to beat him to death!\"Just as everyone's mood changed, Hwang Jong did not shake anymore.\"Cho-ong and ah-an!\"His angry voice rumbled through the top of the galaxy.\"Overpower the Chancellor right now! If you defy me, you can kill me!\"At the behest of Wang Jong, servants rush into the room. Then Bonja Bok, biting her lips, fired tension at the crowd.\"Argh!\"\"Ugh! Ugh!\"Those who enter the room are enraged by Bonja Bok's tension and fall.\"Darn it, it's almost over!\"Bonja Bok glares at Chung-Myung with eyes filled with original poison.\"If it hadn't been for this kid!\"\"I'm gonna make this kid feel bad.\"Chung-Myung stuck out his mouth.I'm not even a baby, but I feel twice as bad because I'm being blamed for being a baby.\"In a little while, revenge will be over! If I knew this would happen, I'd rather take my life! I didn't think about coaxing that stupid little sodan...\u2026.\"\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\"Chung-Myung shakes his hand.\"Well, of course there's a lot of circumstances, but you can talk about it later at the government office. Let's get it over with now. I'm a little sleepy because I just woke up. I should knock him down and get some rest of his sleep.\"\"Hit him down?\"Bonja Bok set off the mine.\"Hahahaha! This young man is beyond self-indulgence. I don't even know how you knew, but you dare say that the martial arts I've mastered is a trick, and yet you'll knock me down? You're the one who I don't know.\"No.\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"\"How could I do such a thing? There's someone else who would do that. There, there.\"Chung-Myung pointed somewhere in the back.Then everyone's eyes are on one place.\"\u2026\u2026me?\"Isong Baek, who was staring blankly at the situation from the back, points his finger to my face.\"Me?\"\"Oh, Jongnam's hero is here to subdue Madu. Please take good care of me without hurting me.\"\"Oh, no, me?\"\"Then who's here?\"When Chung-Myung opened his eyes wide and asked back, Isong Baek noticed the situation. Come to think of it, since Kimok Sseung dragged his students back, the highest number here is of course Isong Baek.\"My, why would I...\"\u2026.\"As soon as Isong Baek asked, Chung-Myung pointed to the side with a slight chin. Turning to him, Isong Baek only then found Hwang Jong staring at him.\"Oh, yes!'This is a chance to patch up his accident! Now that I look back on it, I doubt it was an accident, but anyway!\"Jongnam's sword will deal with the villain!\"As Isong Baek rushed forward, pulling out a sword, Chung-Myung quickly cleared the way to the side and clapped.\"Wow, heroism!\"I wanted to swear to shut up, but I couldn't afford it for Isong Baek, who was just in battle.Leaving behind the battle between the two, Chung-Myung slowly approached Hwang Jong.\"You've solved one.\"\"\u2026\u2026isn't it over yet?\"\"I'll catch you in a minute. He's a great student, and he can't be beaten by someone who hasn't mastered martial arts.\"\"What do you mean, you don't get it right? If you were at this level earlier...\u2026.\"Then Chung-Myung reaches out to Hwang Jong so that others can't see him.His hands turn black and then turn white, and soon turn red.\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I didn't lie. It's true that he's mastered the sweet horse. I'm just showing you a little bit of where it's going to show up later.\"\"Huh....\"Wang Jong, who burst into laughter, couldn't resist and asks.\"Is the small stamp a real master?\"\"Of course.\"That's the most experienced master in the world.'Yes?I'm telling you.APlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the meantime, he has a proud smile on his face that he overpowered the general general.Wipe off your sweat...\u2026.\"Phew, pleural fluid\u2026\u2026Coughing, pleural fluid...\u2026. I've subdued the pleural fluid.\"Hwang Jong nodded trembling as he watched Isong Baek, who came to his front and spoke out of breath.How should I say this?I'd like to say something, but it's just a pity to see your shaky legs.\"Well done, the top of the galaxy won't forget Jongnam's help.\"\"Go, thank you\u2026\u2026Thank you very much.\"Get some rest.\"As soon as the horse ran out, Isong Baek sat there unable to answer.If it were usual, I would have been grateful to Isong Baek for trying his best to suppress the pleural fluid. But now, to Hwang Jong, Isong Baek's appearance was not even visible.Hwang Jong glanced at Chung-Myung.'What the hell am I supposed to say about this situation?'Has it only been two days since Chung-Myung appeared here?Chung-Myung solved the problem that Hwang Jong had dragged on for nearly a year neatly in just two days.Was it this simple to solve?'No way.Hwang Jong knows.Everything in the world is nothing in the future. If this was so simple from the start, why has no one ever noticed the presence of a pleural fluid?It's like there's an old hand hiding in that little boy.'I don't think so, though.\"I think it's all settled now.\"\"Why on earth did the Chancellor aim for you?\"\"I don't know.\"\"Didn't you do this because you guessed?\"\"No, I don't.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Jong is a little dazed.Chung-Myung said calmly as if he could guess how Hwang Jong felt.\"It's the government's job to explain why, and all I have to do is solve the problem and get compensation. On that note, I'm sure you're fully prepared?\"Usually, no matter how much you contribute, you can't ask for compensation with such confidence. A person is basically a face-saving person.But Chung-Myung had no more face to take care of. Now that I am in the position of the three great disciples of plum blossoms that fell on the floor at the plum inspection, what is there to take care of him?No wonder it was absurd, but as if proving that Hwang Jong was not an ordinary person, he nodded still without changing his face.\"Of course, but you're forgetting one. None of the problems have been solved yet. I never asked you to hold a pleural fluid. All I want is for my father to shake off his seat. Can you do this?\"Chung-Myung slightly poked out his stomach.\"That's a double whinge.\"It was a very confident voice.\"If so.\"Hwang Jong replied in a stern voice.\"I promise to support Hwasan even if I have all the power at the top.\"Chung-Myung grabbed Hwang Jong's hand as if he was impressed.Hwang Jong smiled as if he could guess Chung-Myung's heart.\"There's nothing to be thrilled about. \"Of course\u2026\"\"Are you kidding?\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"Chung-Myung's face is distorted.\"You have to reward me, not Hwasan! Do you think a bear can do the trick and a man can make the money?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Jong is speechless.I thought he was twice as crazy as I thought.* * *Chung-Myung smacked his lips in front of Hwang Munnyak lying on the bed.Now, if Hwang Munnyak is successful in treatment, everything will be solved here. Then you'll be able to whistle back to the gates.Everything is done perfectly.It wasn't that hard. In the process, I even like the fact that Jong Nam was bullied. I couldn't care less about it.But if there is only one problem in the meantime...\u2026.Honestly, I'm not confident.'That's all I could do. But fixing Hwang Munnyak was, to put it bluntly, impossible or impossible.If it was not Chung-Myung now, but Chung-Myung, there is no need to worry at all. No one knew that much about Mahwa, and no one had enough experience to overflow.No matter how terrible Mahwa is, it's caused by Mahwa. Chung-Myung's history like \"Daehae\" is enough to erase all the magis.But now Chung-Myung is not a plum blossom inspection.All he has is a very small history that has become only a chestnut, instead of being more gentle than in the past.There is no guarantee that this will remove all the spread of linen in Hwang Munnyak's body. On the contrary, if a maggie causes a seizure due to clumsy touching, Wang Munnyak, who is weak, will die instantly without screaming.\"Is this gonna work?\"It was something that no one could know without trying.Chung-Myung smacked his lips again and approached Wang Munnyak.If you don't know the result, there's only one thing to do.If left as it is, Hwang Munnyak will die. Even though Chung-Myung says it's a tough life, isn't the root of it a Taoist? Lack of ability cannot leave a dying person alone.\"Don't blame me if it goes wrong.\"If it goes well, it's good for each other.Chung-Myung took a deep breath and slowly reached Hwang Munnyak's danjeon. And slowly pushed Hwang Munnyak into his body.Chung-Myung, who was sleeping in the Danjeon, slowly flows out.In the past, Chung-Myung's history was like a flowing river. Sometimes it was a violent conflict, sometimes it was a sea that contained the world.However, Chung-Myung's climbing history is clearly different from that time.ClearIt's crystal clear. Like clean water flowing through the Simsan Mountains, it was clear without any impurities.The clear energy flooded into Hwang Munnyak's body, which was pickled in magi.Woooow.Hwang Munnyak's body has a slight twitch.The shady magis dared not invade Chung-Myung's history. I am busy backing down in surprise wherever I can find it.\"Whoa?'Chung-Myung exclaimed in his heart.It's amazing.I've had quite a bit of experience controlling maggie in my history. But this was the first time in my life.Why is magi magi?It is called magi because it reverses the flow. Magi, which infiltrates another person's body, destroys the body like a poison, antagonizes and pushes away all the energy.But now, instead of rushing into Chung-Myung's history, the maggies who filled Hwang Munnyak were busy running away like fire animals.'If you're good at this...\u2026.'It may be possible.No, no, no!\"I've been through so much trouble collecting these! You should do this for me can do!'Chung-Myung would have saved more than a decade's worth of effort if he hadn't been obsessed with purity and just kept it normal. He's already had the experience of gathering near this sudden force.However, the amount of experience that filled Chung-Myung's power failure was less than a year old. At least, he was able to fill it up this much because he had a seolmaedan.Now, however, only a year's worth of history is pushing Magi's great army away with a short-term stroke, just like Cho Ja-ryong of Jang Pan-pa.'This is something I didn't expect.'At first, I was just trying to lay the groundwork of immaculateness and perfection to get to a higher level than in my last life. However, as time went by, his obsession with purity grew, and his progress slowed down too much.I was wondering if I should let go of this obsession now...\u2026.If you think about it, it's a given.'Zen is basically the opposite of Magi. Zen, which contains the energy of fa(a, has the power to purify everything in the world. Chung-Myung's energy is basically good energy. Among them, it is the most cordial.So no magic can dare to approach it.A terrible maggie begins to neutralize in no time.Chung-Myung also loses his strength and goes back to nothing.Chung-Myung's history neutralizes Hwang Munnyak's magic and begins to wash away the semaek as soon as it smells. They aggressively purify their bodies as if they would not tolerate not only magi but also small impurities.As if you were washing your face with a beehives.'What's going on here?'Beehive washing is something that can be attempted only when there are several heavenly spirits and extreme masters. How difficult can it be to return a body that has already been piled up with tableware to a completely pure state like a baby's body?Even though there are so many cilantro that most masters of hwagyeong need to be fertilized, and even if the dog asks for it due to the fact that there are so many poultices, they do not even try to find it.But now Chung-Myung is throwing up a beehive over an old man who has been weakened by his own power.Although the problem is that Chung-Myung did not intend it.Woooowoooowoooowoowoowoooowoong.Hwang Munnyak began to tremble with fineness. At the same time his body began to turn white and black at the same time. The area where Chung-Myung's history has been eroded is colored white, and the area where Magi is still eroding is dyed black as if ink is flowing out at any moment.Magi was also desperately resisting intruders who invaded the territory.\"Stay strong!\"The body of Hwang Munnyak, who quickly reconciled to the battlefield, was screaming. Even though it is clear that he is unconscious, his whole body trembles and blood flows back to his mouth.Chung-Myung clenched his teeth when he saw the dark red blood wetting Hwang Munnyak's upper lip.This was not a fight between Chung-Myung and Magi.Whether Hwang Munnyak would last until he removed all the magi was the key battle.I'll finish it at once!'Considering Hwang Munnyak's physical condition, hesitating only adds to the burden. It's better to leave everything to heaven and gamble.Chung-Myung, determined, lifted the spirits.Push into Hwang Munnyak's body without leaving a last handful. Thick drops of sweat began to pour down Chung-Myung's forehead like rain.In Hwang Munnyak's body, Chung-Myung's history began to heat up the magis. As caught, it is sucked in at random, neutralized, and even melted the impurities around it. At the same time, Hwang Munnyak's cramped veins expand like boulevard.Magi, who had been fiercely resisting, lose their momentum and begin to flock to one side. Chung-Myung freaked out when he saw the direction.\"Oh, no! No!'hairThe maggie, which has lost its place, is pushed in the opposite direction of the danjeon, where Chung-Myung injects the force. In no time, Hwang Munnyak's hair began to turn black and swell.Like it's about to explode!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No, maybe by now the grim reaper is kicking his tongue behind Chung-Myung's back.But what if I step down like this?'That's more of a failure.'Underneath Hwang Munnyak is perfectly purified. But that's not necessarily good news. The purified body will accept magi at a faster rate.It is the same reason as spreading ink in clear water in an instant.You'll die if you advance, you'll die if you step back.The beleaguered Chung-Myung hesitated for a while, neither one way nor the other.What should I do?What should I do?I want to rush right away if I have a temper, but it is too obvious what will happen if I follow my temper.Chung-Myung, who had been agonizing over and over again, bit his lips.I'm just saying.'You can't do this or that?Then I'll just leave them both alone!Chung-Myung pushed his energy to one side. When a mouse is cornered, it bites a cat, and a soldier who hits Bae Soo-jin fights tooth and nail until the moment he dies.But what if there's a chance to run away? The mouse runs away, and the soldier retreats, abandoning his weapon.Now, here's a place to run.'Chung-Myung opened the way.There's nowhere else to run away from Hwang Munnyak's body. But one place. There's only one place to run away.It's Chung-Myung's body.As soon as they push their heads to one side, magis, of course, start to push out of the empty space. Soon after, he rides over on Chung-Myung's hand, which touches Hwang Munnyak's body. Chung-Myung's body is empty, making it more perfect to run away by sending all the history to Hwang Munnyak.\"Uh...\u2026.\"I groan out of my mind.The numbness of the arm came in and quickly spread to the whole body. With terrible pain, the eyes become blurred and unconscious.\"Kkkkkkk!Chung-Myung recovered his history from Hwang Munnyak's body. Then he began to spread the history to his predecessor.Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!There was a sound of waterfalls falling from the body. The magis, who have no place to go anymore, begin their struggle. But Chung-Myung's history, mercilessly enough to overshadow its neatness, suppressing the Magis like the occupation forces.A situation in which every part of the body turns into a battlefield.Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!There's a heavy drinking sound in my body. Every time a binge burst, unbearable pain tormented Chung-Myung. But Chung-Myung bit his lips with bloody eyes.You lose consciousness here?Don't be ridiculous.The pride of plum blossoms does not allow.Chung-Myung stood there and waited for the last binge. Chung-Myung's history hit the last straw.(Screaming)The roofing will burst.The vision turns white and the consciousness dims away. Chung-Myung closed his eyes slowly. The history of completely overpowering Magi begins to swing the whole body with the victory.One round. Two rounds.As if he was satisfied with the history of finishing the 12th century in an instant, he went back to the power failure and turned his head calmly.After the whole process, Chung-Myung opens his eyes.\"Turn it off. I almost died.\"I'm not kidding, it was really dangerous.This maggie is not affordable at Chung-Myung's level. A little mistake would have killed either Chung-Myung or Hwang Munnyak.This time it was really dangerous. I'm not gonna do this again.'Chung-Myung rubbed his Danjeon estuary.\"But I think it's increased a little bit.\"There is no reason for it to increase, but I feel like my power is full.\"\u2026\u2026it's still a rat's tail.\"It was a history of practicing the word that small peppers are spicy, but small ones are small ones. I don't know when I'll be able to fill it up like a jumbo shrimp.Sighing, Chung-Myung turned his head and looked at Hwang Munnyak. My face is flushed, perhaps because my spite has disappeared. He seems to have recovered his health in no time.I guess so.It's not just the poison that disappeared, it's because I got a beehive. It may not be comparable to having a transmutation, but it would have increased life expectancy by at least a decade.\"Tsk.\"Chung-Myung approached Hwang Munnyak, kicking his tongue, thinking that he had only let others do good things.\"Uhhhhhhh.Looks like he's regaining consciousness.His eyes trembled, and he soon opened them slowly.Hwang Munnyak's eyes, shaking around without focus, touch Chung-Myung.Wang Munnyak soon opened his mouth with a dying voice.\"Who... ...\"Chung-Myung grinned.\"Fresh.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"No, the conviction?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Munnyak snapped helplessly.\"I must have died and come to hell.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"What are you talking about?* * *After Huang Munnyak regained consciousness, the top of the galaxy quickly cleared up.Bonja Bok, who assassinated Hwang Munnyak, apparently intended to kill Hwang Jong and even his children if the plan was successful. If all the blood in the Hwang family is slowly dying from the same disease, the public will believe that the Hwang family is cursed or has a strange disease, so it is a plan to avoid suspicion.The plan actually worked pretty well. If Hwang Munnyak died suddenly, everyone would have suspected it, but after nearly a year of suffering, no one guessed it was murder.Hasn't it even been notarized that Danga is not poison?If Chung-Myung hadn't appeared, the Hwang family would have all been cut off and the governor would have gulped down the Hwang family's property as planned.Meanwhile, the fact that Bonja Bok was the one who competed with Hwang Munnyak. She said a sad story that can't be heard without tears. That's none of my business.\"If you commit a crime, you'll get hit. There's no one in the world who doesn't have a story.\"The only thing Chung-Myung was interested in was the source of danmasu. However, even that was found in a body deep in the mountains on the way up the mountain.Chung-Myung has gone flat.Hagi, if the Magicians had done something, they wouldn't be so sloppy.'No, he couldn't have handled things so carefully and gently. If it bothers you, they're the ones who knock it over.Anyway, in conclusion, everything went well because we caught the pleural fluid, cured the disease of Hwang Dae-in, and confirmed that the Magyo was not entangled.Thanks to this, Chung-Myung, a benefactor at the top of the galaxy, was treated as a valuable guest.It's a very precious treat.\"Hmm.\"Hwang Munnyak sat down lightly.\"Father, you still have to watch your movements. It hasn't been long since he got up after robbing his bed.\"\"It's okay, I've been lying down for a long time, but now I'm more energetic than I was before.\"\"Still...\"\"There is nothing to worry about.\"Hwang Jong looked at Hwang Munnyak with questionable eyes.It was nothing short of Hwang Munnyak's voice now. You look like you're going to leave for a place where you have to pick and fall down at any moment, and you're full of energy.\"More than that.\"Hwang Munnyak looks up and looks at Chung-Myung.\"\u2026\u2026Chung-Myung Small Paint\u2026Are you \u2026?\"\"Yes. Didn't you see her then?\"\"It's a little different than it was then.\"\"Oh, he eats so well.\"Chung-Myung scratched the back of his head with his plump hands.The eyes of those who saw the scene shook subtly.The number of people doubled.'\"How well have you been eating for three days that your clothes are about to burst?'\"Buddha is the only one whose face is dripping with oil. It would have been great if we went to the fire, why would we go to Doga.''There's a reason why you're saying that.'Everyone shook their heads when they saw Chung-Myung, who was twice as big in just three days.At least Hwang Munnyak was the only one keeping a calm complexion. As if to show what an old merchant he is.\"Let's say hello first.\"Hwang Munnyak fell flat on his stomach on the spot. Surprised by this, Hwang Jong tried to raise him, but he stepped back without saying a word after receiving the stern look of his father, who raised his head slightly.Hwang Munnyak, who had bitten Hwang Jong only with his eyes, bowed his head again and opened his mouth.\"Thanks to the small stamp, I saved my life. There is no way to return this favor.\"\"Hey, wake up, wake up.\"Why is there no way to pay back? It's a problem because there are too many.At Chung-Myung's words, Hwang Munnyak slowly stood up and smiled.\"I've heard the story from the servant. If it wasn't for the seal, I'd be dead already. Even an animal knows the grace that saved me, but if you were born as a human being and forgot about it, you wouldn't be as good as an animal.\"Oh, you're so eloquent.That's right. That's right.Huang Munnyak looked at Chung-Myung and said.\"There's no way in the world to pay off life expectancy, but I want to do everything I can. If there's anything you want from your benefactor, please tell me without hesitation.\"\"Oh, what you want.\"\"Yes.\"\"Haha, how can a man be saved and rewarded with the body of a doe? It'll be a big trouble to know at the gate.\"\"Boeun is not picky about people. I was asked by a provincial seeker. So if you pass on the grace, the people of the world will laugh at this wild mother. And it's something I can't allow myself.\"\"I know how you feel, but...\u2026. I won't allow it in the private sector. I'm here without permission for a private inquiry.\"\"\u2026\u2026without the permission of a private inquiry?\"\"Yes, it was so urgent that I didn't have time to get permission for an inquest.\"Hwang Munnyak looked at the young doin in front of his eyes with moved eyes.How can you not be moved when you say that you risked your life to save yourself?\"That much!\"\"As I said, it's urgent.\"Hwang Munnyak was moved and Hwang Jong opened his eyes wide.You looked so relaxed.'But I dare not speak in front of my father.Hwang Munnyak, who had been nodding his head, opened his mouth with a pleased face.\"I'll solve the problem for you. And a stamp. Tell me what you want, because I won't let you know in the private gate. I will do my best to...\u2026.\"\"Did you promise?\"Hwang Munnyak slightly tilted his head at Chung-Myung's voice coming in after cutting his own words.\"What?\"\"I promised not to let you know about the case.\"\"Oh... of course. I'm still a businessman, but I don't think...\u2026.\"This time, even before Hwang Munnyak finished talking, Chung-Myung took a book out of his sleeve and opened it.Wang Munnyak stared at the book and asked with a curious look.\"What about the book?\"\"Oh, it's nothing. I've lost my memory as I got older.\"You're getting older?You do?Chung-Myung smiled and slightly shook the book.\"I wrote it down.\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"\"You told me to tell you what I wanted.\"\"I did.\"\"That's why I wrote it down.\"Ah.So\u2026...the book?all of it'Chung-Myung, who has saliva on his fingers and turned the pages of the book, smiles and rolls up the corners of his mouth.\"Well, can we get started?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Now?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"It was Wang Munnyak, who thought he had made a big mistake.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's like ten years younger.\"\"That's... that's a strange thing.\"\"Members don't know what it's like, but Mac is alive and he's been corrected like a young man.\"Hwang Jong was embarrassed in his eyes.It is absolutely delightful and celebratory that Hwang Munnyak woke up robbing his bed. But it was bizarre that Hwang Munnyak, who had been lying down for many years, recovered in such a short time, and was healthier than ever before.\"Anyway, we're cutting back.\"\"Stop saying strange things.\"Hwang Munnyak shook his hand lightly.\"The ability of the small stamp is just great. It's just the grace.\"Huang Munnyak recalled Chung-Myung's first words to him.Fresh?'That's not so wrong.'If \"freshness\" refers to those who are doing things beyond human beings, there is nothing that cannot be said to be fresh to that child of Hwasan.Isn't that proof of his own?\"So what's going on? You're not just here to look after my safety, are you?\"\"I can't be proud of myself for being a good son, but I'm not a bad son. Isn't it natural for a child to take care of his parents?\"\"Don't say anything, just get to the point. Time is not given for nothing.\"Hwang Jong lowered his head slightly.Even though Hwang Munnyak was skinny not long after he got up, he had the clear eyes of a merchant.You're my father, aren't you?\"Then it's easy to bring it up.\"Father. No, Danju.\"\"Say it. Sodanju.\"By changing the title, the conversation moves from the family to the top.\"I heard you ordered me to cut back on my business with Jongnam.\"\"I guess so.\"\"And haven't you promised quite a bit of compensation to Hawasan?\"\"You're right.\"\"Father, Jongnam is the loser of the West Bank and the leading civil servant of the island. It's so dangerous to stay away from such places and join hands with the collapsing Hawasan.\"Hwang Munnyak nodded slowly, without any particular answer.\"It is only natural that Danju should be grateful to the small master. But the reward promised to him is too much, and it's dangerous to have a deep relationship with Hawasan. If you're really determined, please let us keep the deal with Jongnam as before.\"Hwang Munnyak lifted a teacup in front of him with deeper eyes.He takes a sip of the tea and closes his eyes, not in a hurry and leisurely savours the scent of the tea.How long has it been?Huang Munnyak, who quietly puts the glass back down, opens his mouth with a more serious voice.\"Sodan liquor.\"Yes, Lord Top.\"\"What is the nature of the merchant's duty?\"\"It's him\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Jong, who was a little worried, opened his mouth.\"The duty of a merchant is to make the offset healthy by doing business that follows the right, and to contribute to the country and the world.\"\"Hahaha.\"Hwang Munnyak nodded his head gloatingly.\"Sodan liquor.\"Yes!\"\"You've got oil in your mouth. It's very plausible.\"\"\u2026\u2026Danju?\"Hwang Munnyak said firmly.\"The merchant's duty is to make money. Merchants are chasing money, breaking the law, or sometimes breaking the law and reason, unless it is against the law. Don't you think so?\"Hwang Jong bowed his head down.\"\u2026\u2026yes.\"\"If you want to do so much, do it with the money you earn. If you want to help others, you can help with that money. There's no way a merchant can make money. It's only efficiency.\"\"Then what can I do\u2026\u2026?\"Isn't the current choice even more strange if it's as he said? I can't believe you cut back on your business with Jongnam and increased your business with Hawasan.If Jong-nam finds out about this, it is not strange to say that he will cut off the transaction with the galaxy top.\"Did you forget how I made money?\"\"Of course I know. One\u2026\u2026.\"The way Huang Munnyak made his money was simple.It finds out the value of items that others do not pay attention to and distributes them, or finds and sponsors things that are still undervalued.Whether it's a door pie, other tops, or even thugs.Hwang Munnyak has grown the top of the galaxy in that way, eventually creating the best top in the island.\"You mean you're going to invest in Hawasan this time?\"\"Yes, it is.\"\"But Lord Top. There has been a clear basis for the investment so far. But I don't see any reason to invest in Wasan.\"\"Didn't you see it yourself?\"\"... do you mean the child?\"\"That'sir.\"\"But\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Jong bit his lips a little.Chung-Myung is amazing. There is no denying it. But that's just the greatness of Chung-Myung. One's competence does not lead to the greatness of the entire literary circle. And even more so if it's that young.\"With that child, I can understand that Hawasan is going to improve. I understand that maybe you can be stronger than I expected. But Lord Top. No matter how many times I think about it, I don't think that one child will make Hwasan stronger than Jongnam. Doesn't that mean nothing?\"Hwang Munnyak grinned.\"Do you think so? I beg to differ.\"\"\u2026\u2026Lord of the top.\"\"Sodanju. Merchants should see the other side, not Hyun Sang. Once upon a time the top of the galaxy may have been an important place for Jong Nam, but now we're just one of the most common tops for them. How much longer do you think we're gonna get something out of Jong-nam?\"Hwang Jong looked at Hwang Munnyak with blank eyes.I didn't think that far. Come to think of it, isn't Kimok Sung's attitude overbearing?No matter how much Huang Munnyak was in bed, he would not have dared to be so ruthless if he had any respect for the top of the galaxy.\"Jongnam has nowhere else to go. Of course I'll have to move on, but it'll be slow and slow. But not wasan. If Hwasan grows up as I thought, and we can maintain a good relationship with him, the benefits will be unimaginable.\"\"One, Lord Top. I don't think there's any guarantee that Hwasan can be that big.\"Hwang Munnyak's eyes narrowed.\"It's paper.\"\"Yes, Father.\"The title has changed again.\"You're saying stupid things. A merchant is not a person who waits on grounds. We need to create a basis.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"We're not waiting for Hawasan to grow up. We need to make Hwasan grow up. If we can succeed, we will be able to leap to the top of the middle five, not the top of the island.\"\"It's a tough job. If it fails, there is no turning back.\"\"Huh. You're getting healthier, and you're getting younger. Who cares if I fail? Then we'll just have to start over. You don't want to waste this property?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"It's a waste of time for me. That was so close. But I'm more afraid of the fact that I might not make more money than that.\"Hwang Jong nodded.His father has already made up his mind. There will be no point in further conversation.\"I'm still half-hearted. But if your father thinks so, I'll trust and follow. And I'll raise Hwasan so that I can clear this suspicion with my own hands.\"\"That's great. It's been a while since I heard that.\"Wang Munnyak chuckled as if he was willing. But Hwang Jong's words are not over.\"However.\"\"Hmm?\"Hwang Jong frowned as if he could not give way.\"However, isn't the wealth and reward you have given to the little master too much?\"\"That's the point.\"\"Yes?\"Huang Jong looked up at Huang Munnyak with questionable eyes.Wang Munnyak grinned as if to answer the question.\"What do you think will happen to the small seal?\"\"Are you talking about growth?\"\"Yes.\"Wang Jong was agonizing over and over again, and then opened his mouth.\"Given that heart and determination, I will, of course, sit in a key position in the future. And at best, even the long writers of Hawasan...\u2026.\"Huang Jong was a poor speaker.This is not something to be reckoned with.\"Anyway, he's going to be big.\"\"No. He's already a big man.\"Wang Munnyak shook his head and continued.\"I've been a merchant all my life. I've met numerous giants and many masters, but he's the only one who embarrassed and admired me so much. I somehow released money to find this weapon, but a dragon came into my eyes to prepare for the ascension, not the weapon. There's no way not to catch it.\"\"You mean that much?\"\"You'll find out soon enough. Those who are called the heavenly are incomprehensible by the mindset of ordinary people. Don't try to understand, just watch. Then the time will come when you accept it naturally.\"Hwang Jong nodded.I don't understand everything yet, but if Hwang Munnyak does, I will.But there is still one question left.\"Then why have you given him so much wealth?\"\"He is basically a student of Doga. And he has his own sense of unity, enough to rush here in a single breath to hear that there is a sick person. Of course he did not come here solely out of consultation, but there is no doubt that he is good-natured.\"\"Hmm.\"Hwang Munnyak has a slightly different subtle smile.\"Then the wealth and gifts he has now received will be an indelible burden on his mind. Especially at a young age, it must be more intense. If he could keep the shackles that he couldn't cut off with that wealth, it would have been cheap.\"\"Did it really come cheap?\"\"\u2026\u2026it's actually five times as much as I thought. He was like a viper.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Munnyak's face is full of irritation.\"No, there's nothing much a little boy wants! God d*mn it, if you knew how much it would tear, you'd just pretend to be sick and send him back somehow! I didn't know you'd rip it off like that! I thought I'd cry because I'm young and I'd appreciate it if you threw it in moderation.\u2026.\"\"Calm down, Father. I'm worried about who's going to hear it.\"\"Hmmm. Hmmm!\"Hwang Munnyak, who pushed his out-of-the-box true feelings back, smacked his lips several times and sighed.\"By the way, if you appreciate us and accept us as friends who will go together forever, the top will have nothing to lose. In the long run, you'll be able to earn multiple benefits.\"\"I understand. We should be good friends.\"\"Yes, of course. He's a good friend.\"Hwang Munnyak and Hwang Jong smiled significantly at each other.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You caught a pushover.\"Chung-Myung burst into laughter.\"No, they don't have a real sense of reality, they're merchants. Just because I got you one, you're giving me all this?\"Money!Money!Wealth!Didn't the old good man say that the more money, the better?Although Chung-Myung had already become one of the richest people in the island by robbing the slush fund of Jangmun-sa, it was always fun to see his wealth increase.\"It's hot, too.\"Seomseo said it was a giant statue, but it's just the size of Janggang's hand. I was just joking, but I didn't expect you to give it all. If I took care of one class, I would have called for hurray.Of course!Of course, they wouldn't have given Chung-Myung all this out of gratitude alone. Before Hwang Munnyak woke up, I'd have had enough heart, but once you've recovered, things change.It's human nature to change one's mind before and after the other.Nevertheless, it must be because there is a different ulterior motive that he gave so much without saying anything.But even if they wanted something else from Chung-Myung, it didn't matter from Chung-Myung's point of view.If you don't do it, that's all.'If Chung-Myung was a seemingly young child, he might feel burdened by receiving this much wealth, but unfortunately Chung-Myung was not a child.Rather, he is an old man who has worn out too much.If they had known that, they would have thought differently.\u2026.\"Anyway, we've done a rough job of it.\"Hwang Dae-in was saved, and in return, he was promised support for Hwasan. As soon as he is ready, he will head to Hawaii with Chung-Myung. So I can say he's done everything he has to do here.The only thing left is...\u2026.Chung-Myung grinned at one person approaching him.\"Hey, are you feeling well?\"Isong Baek.Isong Baek, Jongnam's great disciple, came up to the front of Chung-Myung lying on the wooden floor and looked down.\"What's going on?\"Isong Baek stared at Chung-Myung and opened his mouth.\"I'm going back to Jongnam.\"\"Oh, that's great. I thought I'd be lonely alone. Congratulations.\"\"Thank you.\"Isong Baek showed no sign of turning around after saying that. Looking at him, Chung-Myung opened his mouth.\"Is there anything you want to say?\"Isong Baek smiled faintly at Chung-Myung's words.\"Painthouse.\"\"What?\"\"I understand you set me up to solve this problem.\"\"What?\"\"I can understand it because the results are good.\"Chung-Myung got up and sat on the wooden floor. Then he smirked at Isong Baek.\"It's a little strange to say a trap. Wasn't it you who tried to trap me?\"Isong Baek grinned.\"That's why you decided not to blame me.\"Chung-Myung laughed as if he were dumbfounded.'He's got a weird personality.'Kids these days seemed definitely different from the old days. All the pro-Nam guys I met before were anxious to show hostility towards Chung-Myung.I didn't even have time to check what the pro-South Korean students were like.\"So what do you want to say?\"\"It doesn't matter if you're humiliated, if you're in danger, or if you're playing into the hands of a small stamp. It's all because I'm not good enough.\"Isong Baek said with a stiff face.\"But what bothers me is the blemish I shared with the small stamp before it happened. I still don't understand what I went through then.\"Chung-Myung looked at Isong Baek with his eyes slightly narrowed.\"So what?\"\"If I may, I would like to have another prayer with you. This bimoo doesn't have any special intentions like last time. I sincerely ask you to pray.\"Chung-Myung scratched his cheek while looking at Isong Baek.\"Look at this.\"I thought I was picking up a fight again. It's weird not to know that he's been played into Chung-Myung's hands if he knows everything that's going on.I thought I'd definitely run wild like a boar paid in advance, but Isong Baek was burying it and asking for rain.I don't think it means that I'm going to beat him up.'It's a pretty funny reaction.\"Hmm. What should I do?\"Bimu is comparing each other's martial arts in the first place. It may be meaningful for Isong Baek to do the choreography with Chung-Myung, but from Chung-Myung's point of view, there was nothing much to gain from Isong Baek.So there's no reason to accept this request...\u2026.\"Well, sure.\"There's no reason to say no.Chung-Myung got up from his seat. Then he pointed his chin at the yard.\"Here?\"\"Let's go where people don't see us.\"\"Oh, I'm scared. You're not trying to rub it, are you?\"Isong Baek sighed as Chung-Myung pretended to slit his neck.\"Saintiff, I'm not a fool. It's unbelievable, but I already know that the small stamp is superior to mine.\"\"Ho?\"Chung-Myung looks at Isong Baek with an interesting face.\"I didn't tell you. I want to know what I've been through.\"Chung-Myung put on a subtle smile.\"You'll regret it.\"\"That's fine, though.\"\"Yes, well, fine. Then let's go.\"When Chung-Myung took his foot off first, Isong Baek followed him with a stiff look on his face.Isong Baek breathed low.Feel nervous.Although Isong Baek was not nervous even when he was working with masters and private servants, as well as the death penalty, his heart felt three times faster when he saw Chung-Myung standing in front of him.'It's small.Chung-Myung, who carefully re-opened, was still a child.Now, of course, it's a little embarrassing to say child, but it doesn't change the fact that you're at least ten years younger than him. Jong-nam is his youngest.At least one distribution difference.'One distribution is the difference between teacher and disciple.In principle, Isong Baek, a great disciple, can receive Chung-Myung, the three great disciples. Of course, it is difficult to receive a disciple at an age when one has to concentrate on training, so in principle, one can receive a disciple only when one is a great disciple, but in principle, it is possible.In other words, now he's holding a sword to deal with his age.But what?What's this pressure?I just recognized Chung-Myung as an enemy and put him in front of me, but the pressure I've never felt before was weighing on him.Why am I so nervous?'I feel like I'm facing the elders with a sword. Even though that child can't be that level.Actually, I don't feel any examples from Chung-Myung right now. And I can't feel the firm will to knock down the opponent.Just looking at Isong Baek with his wooden sword hanging down.Isong Baek bit his lips and strengthened his fighting spirit.'I have to check with my own eyes.'What he saw.\"You have a good feeling about it.'Chung-Myung made an interesting face when he saw Isong Baek shaking with a sword.Now Chung-Myung poses no threat to Isong Baek. But Isong Baek can't relax like a criminal in front of his eyes.It's a pretty sharp sense.\"Maybe it'll be Jongnam First Sword in the future.'When Chung-Myung was that age in the past, were there people of Jongnam's age who had similar senses?Well, I don't know.It was when I wasn't interested in others. I was busy enough just sharpening my own sword and avoiding the long death penalty.But I can't think of anyone with that kind of sense, if I don't know what it is. Being sensible means you can see more, which leads to potential.It's an atmospheric metamorphosis.'It may not stand out much right now, but as you get older and train, you will start to step ahead of others. And in the distant future, it might be called Jongnam First Sword or Jongnam Sword.But the only thing I feel sorry for is...\u2026.\"Of all things, I was born in an era when I returned.'Chung-Myung lifted the sword.Do you want me to teach you how to apologize?\"Are you coming?\"As Chung-Myung nods his head and aims at the sword, Isong Baek recoils and retreats slightly. Then he clenched his teeth and pulled himself forward.A cloud of sweat on his forehead shows how hard he is now.Isong Baek, who took a deep breath again and again, tries hard to open his mouth.\"May I ask you a question before I divide the sword?\"\"Yes, by all means.\"\"Who the hell is that?\"\"\u2026\u2026I'm Chung-Myung from Hawaii.\"Isong Baek clenched his teeth and said.\"How could you do that? The small sealer must have just learned how to use the sword.\"I've been cleaning up a hundred years until I've had my fair hair cut.And even when I was your age, you grabbed my finger!Chung-Myung smacked his lips.I feel a little foul, but I don't feel so guilty. Chung-Myung of the year was rather stronger than Chung-Myung of the present year.It hasn't been a long time since Chung-Myung started training, and he's moving much slower to build the foundation.In the past, however, Chung-Myung had already polished his sword for more than a decade, and had reached the point of no one dares to stand up to among the late indexers.So there's nothing to be bothered about.\"The world is always unfair.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"But it's not that you don't have a chance. The important thing is to believe in your own path, right?\"\"If I believe in my sword, I can defeat you someday?\"\"Come on. Don't tell me.Chung-Myung shakes his hand.\"When a snake tries to follow a stork, it tears its crotch.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"But it's okay. You won't be ashamed of not winning me. You'll find it an honor to share the sword.\"\"It's madness. It's absolute madness.\"Isong Baek's eyes sink slowly.His face was gradually returning to that of a no man, perhaps because of the conversation, the tension had eased a little.\"Be careful, I know I'm not good enough and I'll do the best I can from the beginning.\"\"As much as you want.\"Isong Baek slightly twisted the sword sideways.Chung-Myung squints at the movement.\"What is it?\"A small change in the black changes its texture. Jongnam is basically a law-seeking cult. There is no occasion to twist the sword. Showing the blade and the blade to the opponent at the same time is a method that is usually used in the p*n*s.Okay.It is the way of Hawasan.\"I'll deal with you with a peace of mind.\"\"Seolwhadenoplast?\"Chung-Myung tilts his head.Was there such a martial arts in Jongnam?Jongnam is known as the 36th Sword and the Taeil Spectroscope.Perhaps he invented something new in his absence.\"I'm coming!\"\"Yes.\"\"Taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\"Isong Baek shouted out loud and jumped at Chung-Myung.Chung-Myung looked at Isong Baek with a slightly glaring look.Now, what do we do?'You want me to crush another junior clean from the top? Or do you want me to teach you how to grow up?Tsk, no matter how bad I am.'It is not my preference to trample on such a child as Jongnam's elder or a great disciple. First of all, teaching...\u2026.It was that moment.Isong Baek's sword causes a heavy change.Never quick but heavy, and colorful, if not flashy.A different change from that of Jongnam, which Chung-Myung has known so far, unfolds in front of Chung-Myung.And Chung-Myung's face, who saw the change, suddenly distorted like a demon.\"This...\"Chung-Myung's wooden sword swings strongly forward without any change.Whoops!In just a few days with heavy drinking, Isong Baek spewed blood and fell back.But Chung-Myung wasn't satisfied with it and rushed forward without delay and grabbed Isong Baek by the collar. Then he pulls himself right in front of his face.Seeing Chung-Myung's face quickly transformed into a demon, Isong Baek trembled without breathing.\"Where did you learn to do this?\"\"Ku, ku, ku, what's that...\u2026.\"\"This...\"Chung-Myung bit his lips.Lunar New Year's Day transplant?What a load of crap.That word may deceive everyone else, but only one.

The sword representing Hwasan.A sword that is said to contain all the integers of Hawasan.Twenty-four Plum Blossom.The twenty-four plumage test, which has now been practiced even in Hwasan, is none other than Isong Baek's hand.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cough!\"Blood spewed out of Isong Baek's mouth. Chung-Myung sighed and let go of his hand by the collar.That's a little too much.From Chung-Myung's point of view, it was unacceptable even if the sky collapsed, but it was impossible for Isong Baek to be guilty. Isong Baek doesn't have the ability to do this.\"Tsk.\"Open Chung-Myung's hand and hit Isong Baek on the back once.Oh my god!As Chung-Myung's energy sweeps through his body, the troubled interior sinks. Soon, Isong Baek gasped with a more comfortable face.Chung-Myung, who confirmed that Isong Baek had calmed down, stood up straight and looked up at the sky.Chung-Myung, who had been looking up at the sky for a long time, lamented long.\"That's Jongnam's new martial arts?\"\"\u2026\u2026yes.\"\"Seolwhadenoplast?\"\"Yes, it is.\"Chung-Myung burst into laughter.You should at least change your name.'This is nothing short of a provocation by the male Hwasan.'No, that's not it.'I'm sure there's no way the sword will be recognized in Hawasan even if it's done this openly.This is a mockery.If Chung-Myung hadn't appeared, he wouldn't have known anything about Jongnam men wearing the sword that had been put into practice in Hwasan.The malice of the man who made this sword was scratching Chung-Myung's insides.\"Who learns this sword?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I'm measuring the answer to what's so great.\"Isong Baek nods his head.\"Let's start with the great disciples.\"\"Start with this great disciple. So it's the great disciples, the great disciples, and the elders who know this sword?\"\"The elders have never learned this sword. The people who are learning this sword are Edae and the area.\"\"I've never learned\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung's eyes glowed fearsomely.If one of the elders had invented the Sulwhadip transplant, the transmission would naturally have been made from a great disciple.\"So the last man to complete this sword is still in Jongnam?\"'It was the best news of all.If the man who did this is already dead and buried, we can't find the man who committed the crime.I don't know who it is, but I dare you to pay for all this bullshit!'Chung-Myung gnashed his teeth.There is no need to find out what happened.Jong-nam would also come to the aid of Hwasan when it went haywire. The Moonpa next to him is under attack by the Magyos, and if he just washes his fingers, he'll be criticized by Kang Ho.\"But you pretended to help, and you actually took away Hwasan's martial arts.'I'm sure not everyone did. But there's someone who did something that Hawasan shouldn't have done while he was on fire.No, maybe....Maybe it's the Magyos' fault for the fire on fire.'Crunch.My teeth grind automatically.The more I thought about it, the more I couldn't stand it.\"You son of a b*tc*...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung risked his life to save Kang-ho. By the way, don't they mean that they avenged Hwasan?Moreover, this is not done with one's greed.People make mistakes. So there are times when I commit a crime. Let's say someone from Jongnam, who came to Hawaii, was blinded by greed and made a mistake.But isn't it Moonpa who should correct the mistake?Without sternly rebuking sin and returning stolen wages, you create new martial arts based on it? Is that also mocking Hawasan by naming him a myth?\"What a load of shit.\"Chung-Myung, who grated his teeth, looked back at Isong Baek with burning eyes.\"You!\"\"What? Oh... Yes!\"\"Don't cook this.\"\"Huh? Why\u2026\u2026?\"\"Don't cook, don't cook! You little b*tc*!\"Chung-Myung slapped Isong Baek in the back of the head.Watching Isong Baek gripping his head and whining, the two emotions intersect.Isong Baek is a Jongnam, so I want to beat him to death.\u2026.\"Tzut.\"Chung-Myung, who had his tongue full of irritation, said while looking at Isong Baek.\"This is Muhak, which cannot be achieved.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Isong Baek looked at Chung-Myung with blank eyes. But Chung-Myung is now telling the truth.If Isong Baek hadn't visited him and asked for a bimoo and showed him whether it was a ssulwhabibal transplant or a babal, Chung-Myung would have been unaware of this for years.It can be said that Isong Baek helped Chung-Myung.Although Chung-Myung is a person who pays back properly and never forgets grudges, this grace is quite large to be crushed.\"Jongnam's martial arts is based on not being biased. It seems slow and heavy right now, but Jongnam's Muhak is that the more you brush the sword, the stronger it gets. But this is not it. This is not a good science for Jongnam. If you want to make it big with your sword, throw it away now.\"\"But the elders say this sword is a step further from Jongnam's existing sword.\"\"Of course you are.\"No one would have had a big mouthpiece yet.Flamboyant things move on quickly. If those who clean the foundation and those who learn the flamboyant weeds face each other at a shallow level, the flamboyant will overwhelmingly win.'Why doesn't Jong-nam know...\u2026.'\"Oh....\"A sigh came out of Chung-Myung's mouth.'That's too much.'I think I know.Chung-Myung caught Jongnam's prosecutors like rats, which is the main culprit of all this.It's not self-consciousness overload or flip-flop. In fact, it was natural from Jongnam's point of view.They, too, would have been proud of their own swords. But decades before Chung-Myung appeared in the immediate neighborhood of Munpa and he died in the battle with Magyo. Jong-nam has never beaten Chung-Myung.Was Jong-nam weak?It never is.\"If Jong-nam was weak, he wouldn't have occupied a spot in the old file room.'On the contrary, the end of the time was an unprecedented time when geniuses. Throughout Jongnam's history, it will be hard to find a time when talent exploded as much as then.And of all things, the geniuses were born in the same era as Chung-Myung, and all of them were smashed into Chung-Myung's hands.\u2026.It's no wonder there's a fundamental doubt about what they have.'Stupid things.If Chung-Myung was Jongnam, would he be buried without being called a 'surveillance\"?No.It is not Muhak that matters. No, Muhak is important, but who uses it is many times more important.\"Well....\"Then, Isong Baek peeked and opened his mouth.\"Did you tell me not to learn the sword?\"\"Yes.\"\"One\u2026\u2026.\"As Isong Baek hesitated, Chung-Myung peeked at him and spoke in a different serious tone.\"You can't decide your own path.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Isong Baek looked at Chung-Myung with slightly different eyes.\"Some decisions are helpful to get advice from others, but real decisions are to be made alone. Neither my adult words nor mine will help. Think about it by yourself and decide it by yourself.\"Chung-Myung turned around. Then, without hesitation, began to walk toward the top of the galaxy.\"Now, hold on!\"Chung-Myung, who was walking, looks back slightly.Isong Baek has been courteous in his book.\"Thank you for your teaching.\"\"Well, don't mention it.\"Chung-Myung shook his hand lightly and moved on.Looking at his distant back, Isong Baek sighed deeply and looked up at the sky.\"I feel like I've met a new person.\"Meanwhile, Chung-Myung's face blushed and repeatedly cooled.\"The more I think about it, you bastards!\"How dare you steal the Twenty-four Plum Blossom? And copy it? I'd love to run to Jongnam right now and make a mess of it.\"Oh, my. Capital punishment. This is how the world feels. Instead of returning the favor, these bastards were doing this bullshit. Do I have to put up with this?\"What are you going to do if you don't hold it in?It seems like Cheon Mun is smiling back in the sky.\"Oh, if I were as strong as I used to be...\u2026.\"If Chung-Myung was now a plum blossom inspection, he would have to repeat that Jongnam's elders were dead, but unfortunately, he was not a plum blossom inspection, but a three-generation disciple of Hawasan.I need to be stronger faster.'I feel it again.Gangho is a place where the powerless can't do anything in the end. Even if Hawasan's long-time writers and elders knew about this, could they protest against Jongnam?I don't think so.It is a privilege only those with power can enjoy to protest and point out the wrongdoings of the other party. Now, Hawasan didn't even have the power to denounce Jongnam's promiscuity.\"Right now.\"Chung-Myung grated his teeth.\"But there's not much time left.\"Eventually, Hawasan will regain his past films. That's bound to happen as long as Chung-Myung is around.One thing I've confirmed today is that after all, Hawasan and Jongnam are incompatible.Now that Jong-nam has done what he should not have done, it is impossible for him to eat well and live well as Jong-nam does.Even if others wanted it, Chung-Myung would no longer tolerate it.\"You have to be stronger faster.\"Chung-Myung's eyes were poisonous.He should be strong too, but the power of the whole wasan should be strong too. If Hwasan doesn't become strong as Hwasan, the limits are too clear.Chung-Myung didn't want to create a Hwasan who relied only on him. It should be a Hawaiian who can stand tall without Chung-Myung.That way, I can punish those stupid things.'Twenty-year-old transplant...\u2026.'It's well made.It is a clumsy copy of the twenty-four plum blossoms. However, he did not just pick his brother, but thought deeply about how to melt him into Jongnam's martial arts.There are traces of reducing the splendor as much as possible and modifying the inspection to suit Jongnam's inner strength, and the speed is also adjusted to blend in with Jongnam's other martial arts.It's not just a copy of the Plum Blossom Act, but it's a willingness to make it completely Jongnam's Muhak.\u2026.\"That's why it's so toxic.\"Chung-Myung's face is full of playfulness.\"If you leave it alone for now, it'll slowly fester.\"And watching it doesn't suit Chung-Myung's personality. It's Chung-Myung who has to beat him if he's beaten. It's not his way to wait and pray for ruin.\"You hit the wrong person.\"Chung-Myung's eyes look south. He clicked his tongue at Jongnam Mountain, which stands tall in the distance.\"You have to pay the price for messing with Hwasan without knowing the grace. Pro-Nam faction.\"Then he swirled back to the top of the galaxy.But Chung-Myung at this time didn't know.I didn't expect the opportunity to punish Jongnam, which I thought would come in the distant future, would come so soon.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was a huge thing.Of course, it's not like no one was running away at night at the time of the fall. But at least it hasn't been seen recently.Thanks to that, the atmosphere in Hawasan was horrendous.\"\u2026\u2026Isn't there an accident?\"\"Accident?\"\"No matter how hard he goes, I don't think he won't come back. Besides, there's no reason why he's leaving Hawaii.\"\"Right.\"Yoon-jong nodded.This is true of Jo-Gol. Chung-Myung has no reason to leave Hawaii. If he had any intention of doing so, he would not have given himself zero medicine.You're leaving Hasan right after you give him that waste?In fact, it can't happen unless it's poison, not zero medicine.Just one thing.\"If a man with no reason to leave doesn't come back suddenly, doesn't that mean an accident happened?\"\"Walk.\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"\"No matter how hard I try, I can't imagine him getting into an accident.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Did you imagine?\"\"I'm a little....\"Chung-Myung's smiling face comes to Jo-Gol's head. Of course, it's not a warm smile, but a wicked smile.'Ay. As expected, no.'He'll survive a cliff, a hell of a cliff. It's impossible that such a guy won't come back after what happened.\"Something must have happened.\"\"I hope it's a situation that the homeless people can understand. You seemed to be really angry.\"\"That's right...\"The good fortune-teller has been called back to the man of letters. I'm worried that something big might happen.\"\"Who.\"Yoon-jong looked around the prose with a frown.What the hell is going on with him?'It was Yoon-jong, who thought everything would be fine, but strangely worried about Chung-Myung.\"Don't you dare!\"Hyun Jong frowned at the sharp voice.\"It's seven weeks and nights. This is the first time that the three great disciples have been away for seven days and nights without permission.\"\"Hmm.\"\"It's not to be condoned. Now that the foundation of Moonpa is being taken, what would everyone think?\"Everyone nodded as Hyun Young, the finance footnote, raised his voice. Surely this is not something to let go of.At that time, the footless Hyun Sang stepped up and opened his mouth.\"Come on, calm down, death penalty.\"\"Have I calmed down now?\"\"Why do you think that way? What if my child had an accident? We may be in need of our help right now.\"\"In an accident? What kind of accident would happen in Hasan? Even if we had an accident, it is true that we left the prose on our own, do you mean we should consider that?\"\"Or even if it's a loss...\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026mmmm\u2026\u2026\"Hyun Young, who was raising his voice, closed his mouth and drooled.Hawasan's mountains are very rough. Those who were on the run often lose their footing and get injured. It is not strange to die if the three great disciples lost their footing at a time when skilled soldiers were also injured.\"Shouldn't we go through the mountains? If you're injured...\u2026.\"\"I'll try.\"Hyun Jong, who remained silent the whole time, answered in a heavy voice.\"We certainly can't rule out that possibility.\"But Hyun Young still didn't back down.\"But that doesn't absolve us of responsibility. Isn't it a matter of the three great disciples emptying their homes and leaving for prose in the first place?\"Hyunjong's face is a bit stiff.It was none other than Hyun Jong who gave Chung-Myung that authority. Now, Hyun Young is secretly dismissing Hyun Jong for giving excessive authority to the child.\"There's a reason for that.\"\"Things are everywhere. You have to follow the rules before you count them.\"\"Jaegyeong Footnote.\"\"Long story. It's a shambles on the foundation of Hasan. Since when has Hawasan been a child privileged place. He is not a great disciple, but only three. I mean, even if I was in Saga, I'm not old enough to grow up yet.\"\"That's enough.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hyun Young pressed his words and shut his mouth in a heavy, cold voice.If you talk more than this, you will cross the line. He also didn't want to confront the long-winded\"\u2026Jang Moon-in. I went too far. But I don't mean to blame the long writer.\"\"I know.\"Hyun Jong sighs deeply.What's going on?I can't understand it no matter how much I think about it. The child he saw, Chung-Myung, was not the one who caused this accident. Isn't that why you boldly gave such powers?\"You mean I misjudged the boy?'At that time, the Ungum, who was still watching the situation, opened his mouth heavily.\"The Long Man.\"\"Say it.\"\"I'll draw my students and make a search party. I'll search the harmony with Hwasan and find Chung-Myung.\"\"Hmm.\"Hyun Jong nodded.\"Go ahead.\"\"When you find Chung-Myung, you must ask for my sins. It is my fault for not properly disciplining the three great disciples.\"\"How did you say it was your fault? They say you're not even her teacher.\"\"I'm a teacher of all children.\"\"One\u2026\u2026.\"Hyun Jong shook his head trying to say something. If we talk more here, it will only reveal the problem that white plumage is not responsible for children's lives.\"This is not your fault. Bondo's confidence in the child was excessive.\"\"It's not like that, long man.\"\"The important thing right now is not to blame. It's not too late to find a child to discuss what's wrong. Wouldn't it be a great pity if we delayed this much time to save the child?\"Everyone bowed their heads deeply.Even if there was a mistake, no one can deny Hyun Jong's thought of his student.\"Unam.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Organize a search party with the lead of a fortune-teller. All support should be spared. Find the child first, and then...\u2026.\"At that moment, a loud voice came from outside the door.\"Long man!\"Hyun Jong's forehead is wriggling.\"I'm in a meeting right now, so a little...\u2026.\"\"The child is back! Chung-Myung is returning to prose!\"Hyun Jong jumped up from his seat. There was a sense of relief on the face that could not be hidden.\"Are you okay?\"\"Yes, your limbs look fine. But....\"\"There you go, I'll leave myself!\"Although there were many unpleasant feelings, it was Hyun Jong who was glad to hear that he was safe.\"Hang on, Long Death.\"But Hyun Young dissuaded Hyun Jong.\"What's wrong with you?\"\"Long death sentence.\"I'm not a long writer.Hyun Young sneaked around and opened his mouth.\"I understand that the long death penalty cares about him. Considering the child's contribution, I know it's natural to be treated like that.\"Hyun Jong slightly narrowed his forehead.\"What are you trying to say?\"\"Don't spoil the child.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Personal punishment is a way to control the civilization, but it is also a way to raise people right. A child does not know his or her fault if he or she does not receive the appropriate punishment. Don't forget that you have to be strict with your beloved child.\"Hyun Jong sighed.\"Don't I know that? Don't worry. I'm the one who wants to raise him better than anyone else. If the child is safe, I will order him to close for 15 days...\u2026.\"\"That's not enough.\"It was the Woongeom who cut off Hyunjong's words.\"It's a serious sin that you didn't return after breaking the order of death. At least half a year in penitentiary custody.\"\"Woon-gum, it's only the three greatest disciples who have done it.\"\"A year is not enough for what this great disciple has done. If you don't punish Chung-Myung, I'll take the punishment instead.\"Hyunjong closed his eyes tightly.The position of a long-time writer in Hawasan is not one where everything can be set at will. It is a place where everyone's opinions are gathered and decisions are made.\"\u2026\u2026are others thinking the same thing?\"\"That's right.\"\"Don't blame us, the long-lived. It's the same with us that we care about his talent. But that's why it has to be tougher.\"Hyun Jong nodded with his face hardened.\"I see.\"Hyun Jong walked outside without loosening his stiff face. Those who were sitting on the left also stood up and followed him.Unam sighed as he watched it.'How did you do this? You son of a b*tc*.'Unam is the only one who knows how much Hyun-jong cares about Chung-Myung. Therefore, there will be no one else but Unam who understands how Hyun Jong feels now.Almost arriving at the prose, Chung-Myung came into the door.\"Well....\"Ungum and Hyun Young's faces are burning up.I didn't get hurt anywhere. Then, he should at least be seen self-reflecting on his sins, but there is no reflection on everything.Why don't you straighten your shoulders and walk in confidently?\"You punk!\"Hyun Young, who couldn't stand it, shouted loudly.\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung, who found those approaching him, tilts his head.\"Where are you all going?\"\"You punk! Where are you going to dress like a...\u2026.\"\"I'm seeing a man of letters.\"When Chung-Myung lowered his head toward Hyun Jong, Hyun Young, who was screaming, stopped talking vaguely.\"That guy? That guy?'\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Is there a reason you're out of town?\"\"Yes, a man of letters. There were unavoidable circumstances.\"Hyun Jong nodded.\"Explain. If your explanation doesn't convince us, you'll be punished accordingly. Hawasan's code of law is strict.\"Hyun Young couldn't stand it and added.\"How dare the three disciples be so self-indulgent! If you don't give me a good reason, you'll get in trouble, you son of a b*tc*! The man of letters has done you a favor! I can't believe I'm repaying your kindness like this!\"Chung-Myung peered at Hyun Young and scratched his head.\"No, it's not that\u2026\u2026.\"\"Can't you straighten up?\"The answer came from behind Chung-Myung.\"Don't do that.\"\"Huh?\"Only then did those who noticed that Chung-Myung was not alone turned their heads toward the prose.\"Hwang Dae-in?\"\"Hua, aren't you Hwang Dae-in?\"\"You said you weren't feeling well?\"Wang Munnyak, who entered the prose, looked back at everyone. The gaze that stayed slightly at Hyun Young soon turned to Jang Moon-in.Hwang Munnyak bent over with a swipe.\"I'm seeing a man of letters. Have you been to Gangnyeong?\"\"Hwang Dae-in. It's been a long time no see. I heard you're not feeling well, but I'm glad you got well.\"I was told as if I were being nonchalant, but in fact Hyun Jong was genuinely taken aback.\"Oh, no. How is this great Hwang here?'Wasn't it only seven weeks ago that I received a letter saying that I was about to run out of breath because of the strictness of my senses?Such Hwang Dae-in arrived here looking fine, although he was a little thin. Only then did figures from the top of the galaxy, who entered Hyun Jong's eyes as prose, begin to enter.\"Long man, don't be so angry. I saved my life thanks to this small stamp. The small stamp saved me and saved the top of the galaxy.\"\"Yes?\"\"Hwasan's grace is the same as Haha's. That's why I visited to thank you in person.\"\"\u2026\u2026What on earth.\"Everyone's eyes turned to Chung-Myung.Chung-Myung smiles and shrugs.\"Well, that's what they say.\"'Ah.''That's mean.''That's why I''It was still Chung-Myung, the world's first to explode people.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was the same for everyone else in the room.There were only two people out of the reaction.One is Hwang Munnyak sitting across from Hyun Jong.And Chung-Myung kneeling next to him.\"That kid... ...\" Do you mean that Chung-Myung cured Dae-in Hwang's illness and prevented the crisis at the top?\"\"That's right.\"\"Huh.\"Hyun Jong looked at Chung-Myung and Hwang Munnyak alternately.I can't believe it.Though a pupil of Hawasan, Chung-Myung is still a child less than three months old. In other words, he is just a baby boy who is barely out of his hair.But does it make sense that such a child has done such an enormous thing?\"Is that really true?\"Hwang Munnyak frowned at the words of the suspicious young Hyun Young.\"Do you suspect that this wild mother is lying?\"\"Well, that can't be true.\"Hyun Young lost his tail.The power of Huang Munnyak and the top of the galaxy is enormous, beyond reach of the present-day Hawaiian.Moreover, Hwang Munnyak was a steady supporter of Hawasan in the past. Without Huang Munnyak, the downfall of Huasan would have been faster. So, didn't the foreman also treat Hwang Munnyak as the most important guest of Hawasan?No matter how Hyun Young is the finance footnote and elder of Hwasan, he couldn't treat Hwang Munnyak recklessly.\"This wild mother is not a very idle person.\"Hyun Jong slightly frowned and looked at Hyun Young. Hyun Young opened his mouth with a pinch of salt.\"That was never my intention. I apologize, and Dae-in Hwang lets go of his anger.\"\"Well.\"But Huang Munnyak did not easily turn a sour face.Of course, I don't really feel bad. Even a small gap between merchants in business should not be missed. Using this as a curiosity...\u2026.\"Hmm!\"Huang Munnyak glanced at the spot where he coughed. Chung-Myung has an uncomfortable face.'Come on.'Three great disciples trying to help the elder of the Moon faction get scolded. Where would you see a sight like this?Wang Munnyak, who could not ignore Chung-Myung's signal, gently loosened his face.Then, the sword opens its mouth still.\"I don't understand.\"Wang Munnyak looked at his face for a moment and asked.\"What about you?\"\"Hwasan's fortune-telling. I'm in charge of white plum juice.\"\"I see. The seal of fortune. You don't believe me, do you?\"\"It's not that, it's because there's a fundamental question. So Chung-Myung can cure a person's illness?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"It is a reasonable question.Everyone looks at Chung-Myung and Hwang Munnyak with doubts in their eyes. Hwang Munnyak was speechless and looked back at Chung-Myung. This is something Chung-Myung needs to explain, not him.\"It's not rocket science.\"\"Can you explain?\"\"Yes, as you all know, I was a beggar, wasn't I?\"\"Right.\"\"Beggars usually pick up anything and eat everything they can, so they often get sick and addicted.\"\"Foolish words! As he said, the control of the world's poison would have been open, not four thousand miles away.\"\"In certain cases, yes, because beggars don't use poison, but they know quite how to relieve their addiction. Especially when it's similar to what's edible.\"Chung-Myung breathed deeply and opened his mouth.\"There's a thing called a soundtrack. It looks almost exactly like mugwort, but it bears extreme poison. It's not common to have accidents because they're not noticeable, but if they can eat anything they can, they often get addicted to these miso. Once addicted, they suffer and eventually die.\"Everyone fell in love with Chung-Myung's words.\"But the way to decipher this chord is simpler than I thought. I don't really find a way to take him to the House, and strangely enough, he recovers when fed grated radish.\"\"So it was the poison of Oeumcho that poisoned Hwang?\"\"Yes, the symptoms were so similar that I tried them out, and they recovered quickly.\"\"No\u2026\u2026.\"Hyun Sang, a non-footnote who was still listening, opened his mouth.\"I've heard a similar story. Apparently, the open side has quite a lot of vision for addiction.\"\"Well, is that so?\"Chung-Myung laughed inwardly at those who were wondering whether to believe this or not.'Ask me, you bastards.'There was nothing to worry about even if I ran to open right away and checked the authenticity. Because this statement is true.War is a battle against supply. However, it was one of the most difficult things in the world to make supplies arrive on time on a chaotic front. Therefore, those on the front lines picked up anything they could eat, and there were many cases of getting sick.What happened to this ochre was also what Chung-Myung actually experienced during the war. It was the beggars of openness that gave the solution at that time.The poison that poisoned Huang Munnyak had nothing to do with the miso, but what do they know?It's all right if it looks good. If it's plausible.'That's how life is.\"I can't believe that happened.\"\"Then there's definitely no going back. Is it a big deal to be late for a day or two when someone's about to die?\"\"I've done a great job. You did a great job!\"Everyone looks at Chung-Myung with praise.\"The Long Man.\"The Woongeom opened his mouth tactfully.\"If this is true, I don't think it's something to punish. Shouldn't we give them a prize?\"\"Well, that's true.\"Hyun Jong's eyes bent gently.\"One, the long man.\"Unam raised her voice slightly.\"No matter how far you take the lead, it is a great sin not to return to your country in violation of the order of the long-time writers.\"\"Does my life matter more than a man's?\"\"\u2026\u2026it's\u2026\u2026.\"\"Did you say that you should praise your disciple for leaving the dying alone and returning on time?\"Unam shut up.\"Hwasan is a civil servant who seeks justice. What can you do first than help and save people? Was my inconsequential order more important than consultation?\"\"I was thoughtless.\"Unam lowered his head and pulled his body back.In the meantime, Unam and Hyun Jong slightly exchange eyes. Since Unam started to rhyme first and Hyunjong showed anger, others will not be able to discuss Chung-Myung's sins. Hyun Jong, who guessed that intention, slightly gave Unam a glance and looked back at Chung-Myung.\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Well done.\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung bowed his head deeply.When things seemed to be sorted out, Hwang Munnyak began to rhyme.\"I and the top of the galaxy are greatly indebted to Hawasan. To be exact, I got help from Chung-Myung, but Chung-Myung said it was all possible thanks to the teaching of Hwasan.\"\"Huh!\"\"That kid.\"\"It's a pottery. It's a pottery.\"Huang Munnyak held a slight complaint.I've got everything I need.'But you can't tell it like it is. From the top of the galaxy and Hwang Munnyak's perspective, Chung-Myung's position in Hwasan is also better.Looking at Chung-Myung's face, which receives obvious lies with a brazen face, it is hard to hold back laughter.\"That's why I'd like to invest a little bit in the company to return the favor.\"\"Did you say investment now?\"\"Yes, investment is a little out of place. The word sponsorship is a little clearer. Investment is supposed to be returned, but isn't sponsorship supposed to be given even if it isn't?\"\"Oh, thank you for giving it to me so far ...\u2026.\"\"The Long Man.\"Hwang Munnyak looked at Hyun Jong and said.\"If I had only that much to clean my mouth, I wouldn't have come here myself with the six brushes. I'd like to bet all my eggs on Hawasan.\"Hyun Jong's eyes trembled.\"Hwa, Hwang Dae-in?\"Despite Hyun Jong's surprise, Hwang Munnyak could only grin.\"Let's take our time to discuss the thread Mu Jin at the top. What we need in Hawaii and what we can do for you.\"\"Thank you. Thank you very much. Hwang Dae-in.\"\"It's nothing to thank me for. It's not enough to pay off the life expectancy.\"Hwang Munnyak and Hyun Jong's eyes simultaneously turned to Chung-Myung.Hyun Jong opens his mouth with a happy face.\"You bring blessings to Hawasan, and now you help her return and spread her name. I'm almost ashamed of the capital.\"\"Don't say that. If I hadn't learned from Hawasan, how could I have done this?\"Hwang Munnyak was amazed.The smoke is up.'Look at that flowing rhetoric. It's just a lot of oil dripping.\"Then you can stay in your seats in Jaegakju and Unam, and the rest of you go out.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"Everyone stood up from their seats.\"And I'll call Chung-Myung again in a little while, so don't go too far and wait.\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung lowered his head slightly and stepped outside with the people. As soon as he comes out, the footnote Hyun Sang pats Chung-Myung on the shoulder.\"You did a great job. You did a great job.\"\"Well, it's not much of a thing to do.\"\"That's great, how come it's not a big deal. I'm proud of saving people, but that's Hwang Dae-in! What a piece of luck rolled into the Hawaiian!\"You're the ones who rolled in.I used to be a rock in here.Chung-Myung sighed secretly as he looked at the young men who claimed to be the owners of the rolling topic.Yeah, yeah, what can I do when they say they're happy?Then, the sword opened its mouth in a slightly stiff tone.\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161.\"\"Yes, my lord.\"\"I know you've done a good job. However, it is also true that it was poorly handled. It's certainly a mistake to get out of Hawaii, especially without saying anything.\"\"I didn't think that far because my student was in a hurry.\"\"That's possible. Be careful next time. This was more dangerous than you thought.\"\"Yes, I'll be careful.\"\"It is also true that you have violated the order of the long writer. You can't avoid it all the time with excuses that you can't help it.\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung lowered his head.But lips pop out of sight.\"Why is he so straightforward?'I did this for you! I didn't do it for you anymore!However, Chung-Myung's twisted mind was relieved as soon as he looked up at the face of the sword.The mouth of the sword twitches. I can't help but keep smiling.\"Well, well, you should always be careful.\"'Trying.'Others approached and patted Chung-Myung on the shoulder, praising him. The existence of Hwang Dae-in was bigger than Chung-Myung thought.You have to pay for it.The person who gives money is the best.\"Hwasan seems to be about to lose his luck. All the good things are going on one after all.\"Is that what happened to Hwasan?I'm here in Hasan.Chung-Myung sighed secretly.When are you going to bring up Hawasan with this pool of blood?'Oh, my. Death penalty. My back hurts now, too.'It was like Cheon Mun grinning in the sky.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if all the people who came up to the main mountain before are combined, they won't be able to do just one Hwang Dae-in.\"\"Huh? Then you're a great man.\"\"I'm telling you.\"The three great disciples, who were talking, distorted their faces.\"Chung-Myung saved such a man!\"\"Wow! This is really...\u2026.\"\"I'm screwed.\"\"Of all things.\"\"Why is he... ...\"It was very pleasant news for Hawasan, but sad news for the three great disciples.With this, Chung-Myung's position will rise vertically, and it is obvious that the adults of Hwasan will be more likely to wrap Chung-Myung around. Isn't it Chung-Myung who is already under the protection of Ungum Sasookjo and Jang Moon-in?But you're going up more from here?Jo-Gol let out a grin.\"I was wondering what you were doing.\"What a ghost he is.Or a man from heaven.\"Isn't it too much to do? Capital punishment?\"\"Well.\"\"He's the only one who's so lucky.\"\"Luck?\"Yoon-jong stared at Jo-Gol and said.\"Do you think it's luck?\"\"\u2026\u2026do you have a different idea?\"\"It's not luck, it's skill.\"Jo-Gol tilts his head. Yoon-jong opened his mouth when he saw him like that.\"It is the authority that Chung-Myung gained through his ability to go down to harmony, and it is also the ability to encounter Hwang's work in harmony. What could we do in that situation? All you had to do was come back to Hawaii and let them know.\"\"\u2026\u2026yes.\"\"That doesn't solve the problem. In the meantime, there is no guarantee that Hwang Dae-in will not die, and there is no evidence unless caught at the scene. If things went wrong, it would have been said that Hawasan, who tasted the money, was trying to persecute the useless and rob them of their property. Even a long writer can't move recklessly.\"Jo-Gol unconsciously picked up his head.Now that I hear it, it's all right.\"Everything looks easy after someone else has done it. But if you try it yourself, it's not as easy as it looks. Develop your skills before discussing luck. If you're good enough, luck will follow you.\"\"All right, death penalty.\"Jo-Gol sighed low.'The death penalty has been nagging me a lot lately.'In the past, it was Yoon-jong who was one step away no matter what happened.Although he is sitting in a symbolic seat as the eldest of the three great disciples, he did not put it forward and never tried to do anything with it.He was just a man who went with the flow, but recently he feels like a great student.People have changed since we decided to achieve something in Hawaii.But it's the same with Jo-Gol.Others shut up and thought if they felt anything about Yoon-jong's words.By the way, Yoon-Jong's words are not over.\"One, I'm worried.\"\"Yes?\"\"The process and the results have been achieved by ability, but it is also true that the position has increased\u2026\u2026.\"It is Chung-Myung who has already made several contributions to Hawasan. Since Chung-Myung made a contribution, can I say that?\"I'm sure he's going to do something else.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The biggest problem with Chung-Myung is not that he is vicious.The evil man is even diligent.\"Sigh.\"\"What sin did I commit in my previous life?\"The white plum was filled with sighs and sighs in an instantaneously.* * *\"Daein Hwang will take charge of the harmonious workplace.\"\"I'm glad.\"\"If you're Hwang Dae-in, you can believe it.\"Hyun Jong calmed down his excitement.'You shouldn't be too good.'But it wasn't easy to press the rattling butt right away.Huang Munnyak offered to manage the workplace without paying. He even promised a huge amount of compensation, saying he would pay back even a little bit of the kindness he suffered from the incident.There are two conditions.Don't accumulate money and use it right away for the development of Hwasan.And the other thing is, give preference to Chung-Myung, the three great disciples.The first condition is no problem.Hyunjong also doesn't want to save money. Yet Hawasan is not in the process of accumulating property. It is necessary to pour money into the bottomless jar to soak the inside of the jar.The problem is the second condition.\"Priority\" is an obscure word.'That is a natural requirement for Hwang Munnyak. Chung-Myung is a lifesaver for him. Chung-Myung is a student of Hwasan, so he said he would invest in Hwasan to repay the favor, but the feelings he felt for Chung-Myung individuals are bound to be a little more special.The problem comes from that 'preferential treatment'.\"What are some ways to give special preference to the three great disciples?'This was making Hyun Jong's head hurt.If you evaluate Chung-Myung's contribution coolly, you will find that he did not receive a proper award.Isn't Chung-Myung already enjoying the privilege that even a great disciple can't wish for?'At a time like this....'Hyun Jong peered at Unam.Unam looked at Hyunjong's eyes and opened his mouth.\"Well, that's a good thing.\"Unam, who drew people's attention, looked around the audience and continued to talk.\"However, Hwang Dae-in gave it to them because Chung-Myung saved them from the crisis.\"\"Well.\"\"Right.\"\"He's a great guy. How can you only choose good things like a ghost?\"\"It's just pottery.\"\"That's why.\"\"Hmm?\"I coughed once in the eyes of Unam gathering.\"Shouldn't we award him again?\"\"Well, yes. That's the way it should be.\"\"You deserve an award.\"Everyone nodded.\"Well, then what prize do you think we should give? Let's all give our opinions.\"Hyun Jong smiled pleasedly as the work was released as he wanted.Wouldn't it be a pleasure to have a disciple who only works well and guesses what I mean? Of course, not to mention the lucky draw.\"Considering that you are the three great disciples, why don't you let me first learn martial arts that I can't yet learn as the three great disciples?\"\"Oh?\"Hyun Jong looks back at Hyun Sang.This is definitely what Hwang Munnyak called preferential treatment.\"I think it would be better to give the child that authority as soon as the research on the Falling Sword and the Chimae Sword is completed. I'm sure you'll be more than happy to.\"\"Good idea. Long story!\"\"I agree.\"It was a very warm atmosphere. Hyun Jong smiled and nodded.\"Yes, my dear...\u2026.\"\"No, you can't.At that moment, the determined voice cut off Hyun Jong's words.Hyun Jong turned his eyes and checked where his voice came from, and closed his eyes tightly.Hyun Young, the footnote in finance.His face was full of anger.\"Long man! It doesn't make sense to award him such a prize!\"\"No, why again?\"This is going to be a pain in the ass.Although Hyun Jong is said to be the long story of Hwasan, Hyun Young was his priest, elder of Hwasan, and a financial footnote. It was also burdensome for Hyun Jong to ignore Hyun Sang's words and proceed with the work.\"Hey, financial footnote, what's wrong with you?\"\"That's not what awards are about! What kind of award is that?\"\"Huh?\"\"Do you think it's good for them to give them credit? Is it better for a guy who's busy learning martial arts at the White House to learn more? That's the punishment! That's why knives are so...\"What?What is it?The conversation's a little weird.Everyone wondered, and Hyun Young shot fire with his male eyes.\"That's not what awards are about! You're not throwing away what you have that's harmless! What kind of award is that? You have to give something to give to the person who gives it to you so that you can say it's a proper award! Do you understand what I mean?\"What's wrong with him?Hyun Jong looked at Hyun Young with eyes that he couldn't figure it at all. Isn't it Hyun Young who explicitly insisted on punishing Chung-Myung until the previous meeting?Then why did you suddenly change your position?At last, Hyun Young's excited voice burst out of his mouth.\"Is this a normal ball? Thanks to the child's rescue of Hwang Dae-in, the money in Hawasan...\u2026. No, there was a huge sponsorship, and Hwang did not manage the business.He said he'd do it with Ryo! Free!\"Only then did Hyun Jong know what was wrong with Hyun Young.Hyun Young is a footnote in finance.And the finance ministry is the place to take care of Hwasan's household. In a good way, it is the finance ministry that manages the money of Hawasan, to put it bluntly, it is the finance ministry.In the meantime, the re-election was a place that could be expressed in a single word.hellWhat a terrible thing to manage the money of a failing literary group. Until now, Hawasan has been able to live with a signboard because of his financial contribution.'That's understandable.'There's nothing to pay for, and debtors stir-fry people when they're bored, so isn't Hyun Young the one who used to raise the game even when he hears money?Meanwhile, Chung-Myung made a contribution.Although Chung-Myung found a huge amount of money in the box, it was money that would quickly disappear.What the Finance Ministry wants is not to nibble away the money it has saved, but to get enough money to spend every month because the business is going well.How happy would Chung-Myung be to save Hwang Munnyak, who is most needed to achieve the situation? From a financial perspective, Chung-Myung's cuteness will not go away even if he carries him on his back for a month.Hyun Young dyed his face red and shouted.\"You have to give them the right prize! That way, he's going to earn the ball somewhere else!\"\"You don't earn the ball, you build it...\u2026.\"\"Anyway!\"Hyun Young was excited to eat Hyun Jong.\"He's a god! He's a god! You have to give him the right prize and keep turning him outside to earn more! Do you understand what I mean? Yes?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Do you know how much money he's made this time? Between these rice-bugs who can't make a dime! What a jerk! You're such a great guy! Do you know what I mean? Yes?\"A footnote, Hyun Sang, stood up with a big smile. Then I hugged Hyun Young from behind and started pulling him out of the room.\"Long-time man, we must make a big prize! Long, long, short story!\"When Hyun Young was dragged out of the room, Hyun Jong sighed deeply.\"I hope you all understand. He's a man of so many things.\"\"\u2026\u2026\u2026I understand.\"\"Actually, you can do more. Considering what you've been through.\"\"What a grudge you must have\u2026\u2026.\"Everyone stole their eyes.\"The Long Man.\"Unam opened his mouth as he organized the atmosphere.\"Re-alertism is right. Chung-Myung needs to be given a proper award. Especially, I'm worried about the word that you'll give me what's left over.\"\"Well, yes.\"\"If you look at it calmly, Chung-Myung's ball this time is not as good as the previous one.\"Hyun Jong nodded.\"But the last ball happened by accident. So the disciples will guess what kind of award Chung-Myung will receive this time.\"\"I guess so.\"\"I want to give Chung-Myung a proper award. For all disciples to know the natural reason that a person who makes a contribution receives a prize.\"Everyone nodded.Hyun Jong looked at the reactions of the people and opened his mouth.\"If so, which prize would you like?\"However, they were all wary of each other and could not open their mouths.\"First of all\u2026\u2026.\"The first person to open his mouth was also Unam.\"The kid likes to go down to Hasan, so I think it's better to leave him in touch with the top of the galaxy.\"\"But isn't that what you call an errand boy? Would that be a prize?\"\"Since Dae-in Hwang loves Chung-Myung, he will be treated well every time he goes.\"\"Oh, I'm sure you are.\"Hyun Jong nodded furiously.That sounds like a great idea.When an opinion came out, others began to express their opinions.\"Why don't we give the Plum Blossom in advance? Wouldn't the children like it?\"\"What's the use of a plum sword for a child trained with a wooden sword? Why don't you give me a new coat of arms! With gold thread embroidered on your chest!\"\"There's no point in not being able to eat! Let's give him something to eat! Or you can let me in and out of the library!\"\"Do you think Chung-Myung is like you? You're going to give me a prize for food?\"\"Then what about the elixir!\"\"There's no such thing as a pill!\"\"I've got money now!\"It was that moment.Gulp!Hyun Young, who burst into the door, hits his chest and shouts.\"Just give me the money! The money! What are you thinking about when you can do everything with money? What a load of shit! First, shut up the prize and the money...\u2026. Eup! Eup!\"Hyun Sang covered Hyun Young's mouth without saying a word and pulled him out. And close the door with an awkward smile.Like this.\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hyun Jong closed his eyes.'It's true that good things keep happening, but...\u2026.'It seems that something is getting a little strange as the way he used to know was going on.I guess it's just me, right?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Watching Chung-Myung, who was silent with his brows closed, felt a subtle sense of incompatibility.You mean this Wang Munnyak is talking to a kid like that?'It is not a class full of self-esteem, but considering what Hwang Munnyak has achieved, it is not enough to have a private meeting with his three great disciples.Nevertheless, Hwang Munnyak is now alone with Chung-Myung. It was not as a benefactor who gave him life expectancy, but just as he wanted to face the three great disciples of Hwasan, Chung-Myung.\"You're on the same boat now, aren't you?\"\"A ship....\"Chung-Myung grinned.\"I was lucky enough to save my boss, but I wouldn't have been able to get in the same boat with Dan-ju. Now you have to talk to the long writer.\"\"I don't want to be on the same boat with Hwasan.\"Chung-Myung squinted at Hwang Munnyak.\"Look at this.\"Did I show you too much?\"Hwasan, who doesn't have a small stamp, is out of my interest, to be exact.\"\"I think you're overestimating me too much.\"Hwang Munnyak slightly curls up his lips at Chung-Myung's modesty.\"Saint. I'm a merchant. I've been a merchant all my life, and I'll be a merchant until the day I die. If I have only one weapon as a merchant, it's an eye to see people.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"If my eyes were wrong, I would have already failed, even if I had been lucky enough not to fail. I'm sure one day it'll sink. There's nothing to be unfair about or regrettable about. But if my eyes are correct...\u2026.\"Hwang Munnyak looks at Chung-Myung with meaningful eyes.\"Wouldn't good things happen to both the galaxy top and the Hawaiian top?\"Chung-Myung scratched the ball lightly.\"Well, don't say anything about being on the same boat. I don't really like such words.\"\"Why are you here?\"\"Those who say the right thing always stabs me in the back.\"That's what they used to be.There were not many people who cried and praised the people of Chung-Myung and Hawasan for saving the world. But none of them ended up showing compassion to Hawasan.But now I don't think you're gonna like that.\"I don't like that kind of saying. For merchants, you can get on and off the ovulation anytime.\"\"Yes, I guess so.\"\"One.\"Hwang Munnyak grinned with a nice face.\"If we have the same destination, why don't we get off the ship? If two people row, we can go faster. Wouldn't that be okay?\"\"Hmmm.\"Chung-Myung looks at Hwang Munnyak with serious eyes.\"Yes, there's nothing wrong with it.\"Hwang Munnyak caught my eye.I'm sure of that'sure.I checked with this.It doesn't really matter how the result comes out of this conversation now. I wish I could ask for Chung-Myung's cooperation, but even if I don't, since I'm done negotiating with Jang Moon-in, the galaxy top will support Hwasan and take advantage of it.Nevertheless, the reason why Hwang Munnyak wanted to have a private meeting with Chung-Myung was to confirm this point.'Hwasan is already developing in this child's head. So you think Hawasan is bound to improve as long as he is confident.'A lot of confidence.But that confidence is not just the pride of a child who doesn't know what the world is all about, perhaps because of the senile feeling that comes from Chung-Myung.\"Painthouse.\"\"Yes.\"\"The galaxy tops will do their best to support Hwasan. You know what that means, don't you?\"\"What, you're going to lose Jong-nam and Chuck?\"\"That's right.\"\"I don't think it's fair to expect a price for something you've never asked for, never wanted.\"\"I don't want a price. I just want the seal to know.\"\"Yes, that's about it\u2026\u2026.\"You'll understand.I'll let you know, by all means.It doesn't cost anything.\"I'm sure I'll see you more often.\"\"Yes, the long writer said that if I had to send someone to the top of the galaxy in the future, I'd be there.\"\"That's a very pleasant thing to do. I hope to see you often and get attached to you. Hahaha.\"\"Yes, of course, hahahaha!\"Chung-Myung and Hwang Munnyak grinned at each other.Deep down, I have completely different thoughts.You little sly little prick!'Who are you to turn your back on? I've seen a cart as big as you in my past life!'They are facing each other with a smile, but they seem to be subtly sparking.\"Painthouse.\"\"What?\"\"It's a gamble on my life.\"\"I think that's what a young man should say.\"\"Well, I think I've gained a new life since he saved my life. It wouldn't hurt to bet on a new life, a small stamp.\"\"I don't think I really care about that?\"\"I just wanted to tell you. Of course.\"Hwang Munnyak stood up from his seat. Then, he looks at Chung-Myung.\"I'd like to say a word to the small master to repay his life.\"\"Yes.\"\"The paintwork is excellent. At the age of a seal, you won't be able to find a person like a seal even if you search the world.\"\"Thank you for your kindness.\"Dude, it's not that there's no one like me at my age, but there's no one like me just looking through the world!I'm the only one who's ever survived.\"But the small stamp needs to hide itself a little more. The world is a scary place. The world is full of ghosts and demons dancing and fighting for a gain. As soon as the small seal reveals itself like a nail sticking out, there will be a flood of people rushing in with affection.\"Chung-Myung grinned.\"You're looking at me too much. I'm just a kid.\"\"I've told you everything I've got to you. Of course.\"Huang Munnyak took a deep swipe and turned to go outside.\"Oh, wait a minute.\"\"What?\"When Huang Munnyak looked back, Chung-Myung had a subtle smile.\"I need you to know a few things. Can you do that?\"Hwang Munnyak nodded, too, with a subtle smile in his mouth.\"As much as you want.\"Like this.When Hwang Munnyak closed the door and came out, Hwang Jong, who had been waiting, approached.\"Did you have a good conversation?\"\"What happened to the agreement with the Jaekyung footnote?\"\"I've decided to put my baggage in harmony from today. If we support and distribute the items above, we will be able to stabilize the businesses before 10 days.\"\"Long.\"Hwang Munnyak put it bluntly.\"Stabilize in three days at the expense of damage. Now is not the time to pursue profit. We have to show them what we can do.\"\"I'll do that.\"Wang Jong couldn't hide his curiosity and alluded to it.\"The small stamp is\u2026\u2026?\"\"\u2026\u2026Well.\"Hwang Munnyak glances back with a subtle look.It's a male monster.'I can't see it. What's on your mind.I don't know if even the seemingly young player is real or fake.\"Hwasan\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Munnyak smiled pleasantly.\"I'd rather call you a mercenary.\"\"Yes?\"\"It's nothing. Let's go.\"Hwang Munnyak swirled out.Yongso.A nail where a dragon lives.It was not necessary to think about who the dragon meant.\"It's paper.\"\"Yes, Father.\"\"You've changed your mind again. Maybe we should put everything on the line in Hasan.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwang Munnyak looks around with slightly excited eyes.Merchants don't live on money, they live on information. Money is just a result of using information.I noticed before anyone else that there lived a dragon in Wasan, where no one was paying attention. The value of this information could not be easily guessed by the presbyterian Wang Munnyak.\"If we use this information well, the top of the galaxy could rise to the top of the world.'It won't be easy, but isn't it worth a try?\"There must be a lot of work to do. Let's go. Let's set the stage.\"Huang Jong quietly followed Huang Munnyak with a look of bewilderment.And on the high eaves of the White Plum, a pair of eyes were watching their backs go away.\"Sad.\"Chung-Myung, who was watching the two leading the six-sols and being sent off by the Hwasan adults, lay down on the eaves.\"I heard old ginger is spicy.\"Dealing with Hwang Munnyak was totally different from dealing with Hyun Jong or other elders of Hawasan. Of course, the elders of Hawasan are both profound and wise. But in the cold, they are the Taoists who have lived in the mountains all their lives.Wang Munnyak, who has lived his entire life in a world of agitation, couldn't be like them.\"Whatever.\"Anyway, if we've solved it, that's all.Hwang Munnyak will be a great help to Hawasan in the future. I'll fill in the parts that are lacking in Hawaiian.Wealth?No.Hwang Munnyak will fill the sense of worldly affairs that Hawasan has long been away from the world. It's necessary as long as Hawasan claims to be a gate.Chung-Myung, who put his fingers on the back of his head, smiled at the blue sky.\"Anyway, I've solved one, death penalty. What do you say? Do you think I did a good job?\"The image of Cheon Mun over the sky smiles at Chung-Myung.As ifWhy don't you just say, \"Hey, look at this?\"'It seems to say that.\"It's only one step. What?\"Have a long way to go.The biggest obstacle to Hawasan's flight was cleared. There will be no problems with wealth in the future.Now that we've solved the problem of making ends meet, it's time to concentrate on martial arts.This is not the time to speak ill of Jong-nam.If Jong-nam had forgotten their roots and turned to something else, hadn't Hawasan lost his roots at all? We need to get numbers as soon as possible and give them back the roots of Hawasan.Chung-Myung sprang up his upper body.\"Yes, when do you grow them?\"I'm sorry to hear that, but I feel a little better looking down at the view of Hawasan. It's a lot different than it used to be. Even so, when he looks at Hwasan, he's just...\u2026.Chung-Myung lay down again.\"Death penalty, death penalty. I should have listened to the death penalty when he nagged me like that. Now that I'm on death row, I know.\"Chung-Myung closed his eyes.I can see myself hiding on the eaves and avoiding the death penalty's eyes, and Jang Moon-hyung, who was looking for himself with a hot face, are visible.The appearance has changed, the years have changed.Hwasan\u110b\u1173\u11ab Hwasan.Yeah, it's just Hawaiian.It was one day when the long winter had gone and the first spring plum blossoms sprouted up in Hawasan.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I think honey is going to fall from my eyes.\"You have to eat a lot.

When I see black hair rising under white hair, and black hair under my ears, I feel absurd.I'm way too old to do it.'Although it was a figure suitable for his age, it was also too light-haired considering that they were unmanned. Those who had suffered so much that they seemed to be returning to their senses as they regained their composure.The chords settled down, and the elders regained their laughter.And time began to flow like a running water. His disciples accepted the passage of time, feeling the stability that had come to the city for the first time in decades.And while everyone was enjoying a peaceful life, the three great disciples were dying.\"Turn it off.\"\"Oh, my. Oh my God.\"The three great disciples, carrying rocks the size of a human body, moved their bodies sweating like rain. He bends until he touches the floor and raises it with all kinds of evil.\"Turn it off!\"\"Oh, my waist...\u2026.\"However, one thing that has changed is that the curse on Chung-Myung, which would have been natural to pop out incessantly, has almost disappeared.\"Oh, I'm dying!\"\"I'm not dying. I'm not dying. Straighten your back.\"\"No, I'm really going to die...\u2026!\"\"You just have to do it two more times. Now, this is the last one. This is the last one. Way to go. You're good. One more time?\"\"Argh!\"A person who falls down on the floor pushes out a rock and gasps.\"What if I die like this?\"\"I'm not going to die. No one's dead yet.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yeah.\"At first, Chung-Myung made me do it, so I started without knowing anything. I started training because I didn't want to be hit, I didn't want to be caught.However, after months of training, I realized something.'This is working.'No, it's not enough to say it works. The effect, to be precise, is enormous. Since I was able to endure training thanks to the medicine fed by Chung-Myung, I have felt the effects of training all over the body.For now, the lower body has become rigid, the sword path has not been shaken, the stamina has been increased, and above all, the whole body is energetic.No matter how motivated they are, they are basically all unmanned. If a warrior can be strong, he or she can not hesitate to chew a snake alive and throw himself to the cliff of Manjangdanae.Who would refuse to train when they can improve their skills by lifting rocks?The crying sound of the mouth, but the number of stones carried increased, and now there are people who lift the male rock.The most noticeable of them was Jo-Gol no matter what anyone said.\"HaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaJo-Gol was lifting a rock twice its size. Everyone stuck out their tongues at the sight.\"Can you do that without any experience?\"\"I know.\"The way they talk has changed quite a bit. It's only been a few months, and everyone was a bit taller and their shoulders widened.Jo-Gol, in particular, has changed enough to rub his eyes on anyone who knew him before. He, who belonged to a slightly smaller axis of the three great disciples, has now grown to be on the larger side, and his whole body has been strengthened with solid muscles.Yoon-jong grinned as he looked back at everyone.'It's a strange thing.'When I first started this training, Yoon-jong had a lot of worries.Basically, it's Hwasan's black speculum, and it's a testicle. It is characteristic of Hwasan's sword to make numerous changes based on speed and to pressure the opponent through those changes.So I thought this training method of simply building strength would interfere with the spread of Hawasan's sword.Somehow, the sword became twice as sharp as the effect of the training.Thanks to this, he was able to digest the mussels that he had learned from the beginning, and now he was learning a new sword called the Falling Sword.Although it was a little too much to learn with Chilseongbo, Yoon-jong was more than happy to learn.Chilseongbo and Nakhwa Geom differ from the martial arts they have learned so far. The more you dig in, the more the trick of rising is hidden. It is a martial arts that makes you confident that you can be strong once you learn this.So I can't help but get excited.Just one thing.'\"Oh, my God!\"\"Turn it off!\"\"Wow, the sword is like a chopstick with a big body!\"\"LOL, this is it! Get me another piece of metal!\"Is this a Hawaiian or a Hawaiian house?It was Yoon-Jong who could not erase the feeling that Hawasan, which had to flow and pottery, was turning into a bandits' den.\"The death penalty. It's time to go eat.\"\"Well, yes.\"In the past, everyone was looking forward to the end of the training session, but now that they have made their own training plans, they often go over time.It is also Yoon-jong's role to train too much to keep the day's plans from being disrupted.\"Let's stop organizing and go in. I'm going to wash up, eat, and go to breakfast training.\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"\"I'll finish what I've been doing.\"\"Well, you should.\"Looking around, Yoon-jong glanced at Jo-Gol.\"But where is Chung-Myung?\"\"You don't come to training very often these days.\"\"Well, it is.\"Since the physical training of the three great disciples began to work on their own, Chung-Myung did not show his face well at the training center.\"That doesn't mean you sleep on your back, but you always seem to wake up first. Where the hell are you pawing at?\"\"Do we understand? Isn't Chung-Myung the busiest person in Hawaii?\"\"Right.\"It wasn't empty words, it was true.After a series of events, Hawasan was revived. Visitors who had never been able to visit before have become common enough to visit at least a few people a day, and businesses recovered from the chords are being refurbished and earning money smoothly.In line with that, the renovation of the old buildings in Hwasan has been carried out, and maintenance for visitors is also under way.Meanwhile, Chung-Myung was busy traveling between the top of the galaxy and the top of the galaxy.\"Death penalty.\"\"Hmm?\"\"How strong are we now?\"\"Well.\"Yoon-jong tilted his head.Strength is a relative thing. You need a yardstick to know how strong you have become. But they don't have a yardstick. It is clear that it is getting stronger, but it is hard to feel how strong the death penalty has become as all of them grow together.\"Wouldn't he be at least twice as strong as he was before he appeared?\"\"Only twice as much?\"\"I don't know. Double is a bit abstract. What's certain is that I'm confident of dealing with three of course.\"\"That's not enough.\"\"Huh?\"\"You know. That sashimi is coming soon.\"When the word \"raw fish\" came out, Yoon-jong frowned.\"Right.\"\"You have to be stronger. A lot more.\"\"\u2026\u2026I see.\"Yoon-jong smirked.\"Let's ask Chung-Myung to roll a little more.\"Jo-Gol nodded resolutely with a grim face.* * *\"What are you doing?\"Chung-Myung trudged toward Nakhwabong.To be strong, no man must train.His sword is perfectly fitted to the body of the past. Thus, it is plausible to follow suit, but it has not achieved the perfect neocomposition date as it did in the past.There is no royal road here. The sword must be swung constantly to resolve the dissonance of the body and head.However, the problem is that Chung-Myung's sword is not something that can be swung in front of others. If he makes up his mind and trains properly, he'll flip it over.\"Yeah, I'd rather die than suffer.\"In the end, I had no choice but to train in a place without other people's eyes.These days, people climb mountains early in the morning and wield swords on rare Nakhwabong Peak.I'm supposed to do something about this.'There is no problem climbing to Nakhwabong, but the problem was that time was wasted.I'm running out of time anyway.'It is so busy that it is eye-catching just to repair the three great disciples, manage the harmonious workplace in conjunction with the top of the galaxy, and gently appease the long-time writers and elders who do strange things in between.But more important than that, Chung-Myung becomes stronger.There's no time to relax.'If given 100 years as it is, Chung-Myung will someday step into the realm of plum blossom screening in the past. And you can be stronger than you used to be. As much as Chung-Myung becomes stronger, Hwasan will naturally become stronger.But the world is not so easy.If there are people who are after Hawasan, they will try to do anything before they become stronger, and even if there is no specific target. There is no place to welcome Moonpa who has begun to flourish.It will somehow get in the way, and those who pick a fight will appear.What if you take your time and bump into people you can't handle while being strong?Besides, isn't there a time in Hawaii where Jongnam is bound to be in trouble?Chung-Myung shook his head.'You have to be strong as soon as possible. Enough to solve whatever happens.'So I couldn't neglect my training. I just have to climb as fast as I can. Lying down doesn't make you stronger. Clenching teeth and diligently...\u2026.\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung squinted his eyes.There's someone.An uninvited guest appeared at the training center that Chung-Myung had set up and used since a month ago.Who's gonna be here from this time...\u2026?'In Chung-Myung's eyes, who approached carefully to the Nakhwabong Peak, a figure of someone wielding a sword under the moonlight came in.The sword creates a smooth line at the end.Soft but powerful. And fancy but elegant.A sword that hits the ground embroider the sky, and slowly falls like a falling flower petal.sword dance ( \u1100\u1165\u11b7).A dark dawn when the sun hasn't risen yet. A woman was dancing sword dance under the moonlight shining on the world.White and black hair. And the sword that shines under the moonlight.\"A man of the moon...\"\u2026.\"Chung-Myung dazed into the sword dance of a woman.The sword melts in the moonlight.A tender, but never-shakable sword. It looks like that black plum flower. Yes, Hawasan's old sword is melted in that sword radish.Chung-Myung has fallen into a bizarre fascination.Hwasan's old swordsmanship, which I thought would no longer be seen by others, was now unfolding in front of him.It's not a question of what swordsmanship you've mastered. It's a question of what it means to wield a sword.Yeah, like....\"Who is it!\"At that moment, a sharp voice burst, and a woman dancing a sword dance suddenly flooded into Chung-Myung.\"Huh?\"The woman, who came right in front of Chung-Myung, sharply stabbed the sword.\"Huh?\"A fierce sword touches Chung-Myung's neck.Chung-Myung sighed, staring blankly at the sword touching his neck.'Frozen to death.'I can't believe a kid like this caught a sign. Plum check is dead.\"Who are you? I don't think I've ever seen you before.\"The same goes for this side.Who are you?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The only person who can wear this uniform is a disciple of Hawasan.second childTsk, tsk. You're going to be mesmerized by men.'to be prettyIn his previous life, Chung-Myung rode the river countless times. Although it is said that it is the right path of Taoist to polish the province without being swayed by the world, it was impossible for Chung-Myung, who is famous for being the master of Hawaiian, to be stuck in the city.It has been since the late index. It started with a slap on the cheek of the late indexers of other literary groups, such as geniuses, talent from 100 years, or Samryong.After that, Hwasan's reputation had to be achieved through collaboration with Madu who caused trouble or the Sapa who cheated.In his old age, he had to prove that Hawasan's sword was the best thing in the world by knocking down all the masters of any clan.Of course, I didn't mean to.'The old guys have to peck at me.'It's human nature that I don't want to do it. It was the role of the elders of Hawasan at the time to somehow link Chung-Myung, who would not go even if he died, with Cheon Mun. Thanks to this, Chung-Myung looked back on the lake to the point where he was sick and tired of it.However, I have rarely witnessed such a beautiful woman as Kang Ho-haeng. Although there is a feeling like a flower that has not bloomed yet, I wonder what it will look like if it blooms someday.Blackish hair, eyebrows, white skin, and perfectly clear, big eyes were impressive.If Chung-Myung were a child who didn't really have the terms and conditions, he might have been overwhelmed by that beauty by now.The problem is that Chung-Myung is an old man who has experienced too much and seen too much to be swayed by his mere beauty.\"Who are you?\"\"Human.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The sword pokes in a little more.Oh, come on, he doesn't know a joke! Joke!\"Hwasan's blessing.\"Her eyes stay on Chung-Myung's chest and then head back to her face.\"A face you've never seen. Who?\"\"I've never seen you there before.\"The woman's eyes get thinner.\"Are you the three greatest disciples?\"\"Yes.\"\"Hwasan's three great disciples are off limits after sunset.\"\"I can.\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"\"The long man has given me permission.\"Chung-Myung's brazen retort added a chill to the woman's face.\"The long man?\"\"Yes.\"\"To the three great disciples?\"\"Yes.\"\"Lie.\"Chung-Myung shrugged his shoulders without answering.\"Check it out. Don't tell a lie in the name of a long writer, wasan's disciple?\"The woman's eyes shake slightly. He must have thought he had a point.\"So please get rid of this sword. It stings.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The woman pulled down the sword for now. I haven't confirmed the truth of the horse, but it's not a crime for Chung-Myung to be here if it's allowed by a long writer.only\"It's forbidden to see other people's training.\"\"This is where I used to train. Until yesterday, another person suddenly appeared where I used to use it, but if you ask me why I'm peeking, what should I say?\"\"You can leave the moment you find it.\"\"I've never seen a stranger poking around in Hasan, so I'll have to check it out.\"The woman bit her lips gently. His white face turned slightly red, and he seemed to be getting angry.'He's not good at arguing.'The black looks quite sharp, but the tongue is not sharp. If you had a face this big, you wouldn't have had much time to argue.'What a dirty world.'Anyway, handsome people live a comfortable life.\"What's your name?\"\"It's Chung-Myung.\"\"Have you received the Doho yet?\"\"No, your name is Chung-Myung.\"\"\u2026\u2026the three great disciples are celadon? It's not Doho. It'\"\"Yes, if you get Doho, you'll get Chung-Myung, too.\"\"Oh....\"It's blind. Definitely blind.\"I am Yoo-Esul.\"\"Yes.\"Yoo-Esul stares at Chung-Myung without saying a word.\"What's wrong?\"\"I am a great disciple, and if you are the listener of Hwasan, I am your accident.\"Yes?Chung-Myung tilted his head.There was a white porcelain boat?'Of course, the distribution of Hwasan follows Chung-Myung Hyun-unbaek, so it is natural that there is a white porcelain boat underneath the Unja ship. After that, you go back to the first time and have a celadon belly.In other words, it is normal to have a white porcelain boat underneath the luck boat that teaches children now.'Cause I can't see a single one, I just forgot about it.'In the event of a war or a feud at a shrine, the distribution of the temple immediately leads to various problems due to age differences. Therefore, depending on the circumstances, even one distribution is skipped.I thought it was done because things were so difficult for Hwasan, but do you mean there's a white porcelain belly?\"I've never heard of a private residence or an accident in Hawaii before.\"\"You're the youngest of Hawasan, aren't you?\"\"Yes, I am.\"\"Didn't your executions tell you?\"\"Uh... ..that's...\u2026.\"There is no way that the three great disciples, who are thinking about how to run away just by making eye contact with Chung-Myung, can tell Chung-Myung such information.\"It's my sin.\"Chung-Myung, who was simply convinced, nodded neatly.\"There must have been a mistake. What do you say?\"An unexpected white porcelain boat appeared. But what's wrong with that? From Chung-Myung's point of view, there are only a few additional blocks of blood.\"That's it?\"\"What?\"\"Greetings?\"Chung-Myung distorted his face.'No, it's the size of an old man who wants to eat it.'It's a sin to be young. It's a sin to be young. I'm so sad.\"Yes, nice to meet you. Accident.\"Chung-Myung greeted roughly with a voice with no emotion.So go away now.'I need to train, too. Don't waste your time sitting around taking up someone else's training center! You're trying to open it!\"...that's a weird kid.\"Who?Did I?Yoo-Esul, who was looking at Chung-Myung with a keen eye, opened his mouth with a slightly chilly voice.\"I'm going to make sure you're telling the truth. If you lied, you'd better be prepared.\"Chung-Myung replied in a scathing way.\"Sure.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yoo-Esul, who has been staring at Chung-Myung without a word for a long time, slightly turns his head.\"That's so weird.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"I'd like to return that word for word.Yoo-Esul, who put the sword in the search, gave Chung-Myung a glimpse and began to climb down the Nakhwabong Peak. By the time the figure disappeared, Chung-Myung sighed as he looked at the sun was rising distance.\"Oh, my God.\"I'm treated like this by a kid who's not even my great-grandchild.\"The training session has become ambiguous.\"I can do it if I want to, but when I feel like someone is sharing this place, I lose my mind to train.'Whenever I train, I'm going to go down and up wasan.'Chung-Myung smacked his lips.I think we should look for another training center.* * *\"What's wrong with the atmosphere?\"Chung-Myung tilted his head when he saw the restaurant in which the portrait house was made.This is the first dark, dreary atmosphere in months. I think Baekmaegwan used to be like this. It hasn't been like this since Chung-Myung turned it upside down.\"Are you here?\"Yoon-jong slightly raises his hand.Chung-Myung, who took the rice and went to the table where Yoon-jong and Jo-Gol were sitting, asked as soon as he sat down.\"What's wrong with the atmosphere?\"\"\u2026\u2026your private servants are coming back.\"\"A white porcelain belly?\"\"Oh, do you know that?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Let's get him.I'm the one who's lived in Hawaii all my life, man!\"So what? What's wrong with the return of the white porcelain ship?\"\"Well, first of all, don't call your private servants white porcelain ships. If private servants listen to it, they'll have an affair. You can get in big trouble.\"\"Me or you?\"\"\u2026\u2026I need to think about that.\"Yoon-jong had a wry smile.\"The private servants have been leaving the city for closure. In the past, there were no large-scale abandoned pipe training in Hawasan because the training centers were not properly maintained.\"\"You've been studying abroad.\"\"\u2026\u2026I haven't been to another school, so I don't think it's a good idea to study abroad.\"\"So what? It's nothing but the kids are doing that's what the kids are doing. Do all the private servants have bad personalities, so they beat them up?\"\"Housewives don't persecute people like anyone else.\"\"I wonder who that 'who' is.\"\"\u2026\u2026Let's move on.\"Yoon-jong flustered out of the attack. Then Jo-Gol is quickly spoken to.\"It's because of the Hwajong Branch.\"\"Huh? Sashimi that ends with flowers?\"\"It's not that, it's the Hasan and the Pro-Nam Council.\"\"What's that?\"Jo-Gol sighed.\"Hwasan and Jongnam interact once in a while. Now, we have an emergency mission competition where we gather once every two years to compare each other's achievements.\"\"Oh, I think I heard there's something like that\u2026\u2026. When did you get it?\"\"I don't know. Anyway, I hear it's been a while.\"Yoon-jong helped.\"I heard that the first Hwajong Branch was a gathering where we socialized once every five years. It changed little by little and went to a situation where he was working in the name of a venue for exchanges between the three great disciples.\"\"Bimu?\"\"If you call it a dagger...\u2026.\"The answer came from somewhere else.\"I was beaten unilaterally.\"\"My back is still aching.\"\"How do we hold out this time? If it's a dog's dinner break, all of you should wear ironclad on your faces. It's such a mess.\"Chung-Myung grinned as he watched the situation going back.\"Oh, I mean. Because things get bigger if your superiors fight in person, the three great disciples fight? And you've been beaten unilaterally?\"\"That's right. That's why we decided not to be humiliated this time, and now we're back from closing down as a group. In other words, it's time for the Hwajong Branch to be held.\"\"Oh, really?\"Chung-Myung's mouth curled up.\"You mean you're going to be bimoo with Jongnam?\"Jongnam.The Jongnam.In fact, bad feelings for Jong-nam were at the highest point of his life.In the past, I felt sorry for him. But recently, when I found out about Sulwhasip transplantation, I think Chung-Myung is the one who grinds his teeth in his sleep.\"Bimura\u2026\u2026.\"In the past, there was no such thing as Hwajong branch when Chung-Myung was present.At that time, Hawasan was the world's first inspection, and Jongnam was in a bad mood, so there was no point in a non-military competition. But while Hwasan is weak, he's showing signs of friendship?It's not even funny.'These are the easy ones for Hwasan, right?'Chung-Myung's eyes turned.Even though Hwasan's appearance is a mess, it's Chung-Myung's cub. I'm the one who's gonna peel my baby, not the one who's!\"That's why they're here!\"\"Chung-Myung, please. Please call them private lodgers. Please.\"\"Oh, well, then those private servants!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"If it's closed, can we win?\"\"\u2026\u2026that's a bit.\"Yoon-Jong couldn't readily answer. It means that it is disadvantageous to close the building in preparation for the absence of duty, but no matter how high the achievement is, it is hard to guarantee that it will win.\"You're right.\"Chung-Myung gritted his teeth.\"Then we should at least win!\"\"Huh?\"\"You're prepared to do anything to win, aren't you? Swallow the poison! Or broken arms and legs! Of course, if you can somehow beat Jong Nam's children and make his name famous, you'll be determined to die!\"No, that's a little...\u2026.I think you're going too far.\"Don't worry! I'll let you win! I'm gonna f*ck you up!\"I don't think he's a master.Let's go to Noklim and make a bandit.

He wants to pull the Hwajong branch a little bit this time.\"\"Can't you postpone or postpone the meeting?\"\"It's difficult.\"The cloud cancer sighs.\"Hwasan is in high spirits right now. Everything is going well, and at least I can live without worrying about food. I can't stop smiling on everyone's faces. This is a remarkable change, considering only a few months ago.\"\"Right.\"Hyun Jong agrees with Unam.The most different thing is that Hawasan is full of energy.Those who lived without knowing what would happen tomorrow saw hope. A full-faced smile makes the viewer feel warm.\"But we are essentially Mufa.\"\"Right.\"\"We're discovering and learning new martial arts, but it's not time for real results yet. And even if it pays off, it's not enough to compete against Jongnam.\"Hyun Jong nodded silently.Unam is right about everything.In the past, Hawasan had a martial arts that could overwhelm Jongnam, but the only martial arts that remain in today's Hawasan is its shell. It was only to the extent that the Chimaegum was found and gained hope.'That's a silver lining, too.'There is a long way to go.I've just managed to solve the problem of making ends meet. But in order for Hwasan to regain his old reputation and film, he must eventually regain his past reputation.But what kind of martial arts can solve a problem overnight?There was absolutely no time left.\"If the results of this Hwajong Branch are the same as before, I'm afraid that my disciples, who had hope that they could only do it, will become defeatists, too.\"\"Unam.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes, a long writer.\"\"Why wouldn't I know that?\"Hyun Jong shook his head.\"But what difference does avoiding make? Will the disciples have hope just because we avoid the Hwajong Branch? Don't you think even the long writers don't trust them?\"\"That's\u2026\u2026.\"Unam lowered his head.\"There is no shame in losing. It can't be helped if you lose even though you did your best. You just have to try harder. But to avoid losing is something you should never do. It's like bringing in bigger anger for immediate comfort.\"\"I was short-minded, Jang Moon-in.\"\"I fully understand your concern. But\u2026\u2026 it must be difficult to postpone the Hwajong branch in many ways.\"Unam sighed.'You said something nice to distract the writer.'In this case, we need to say something hopeful.\"In fact, wouldn't it be a good thing if these students could make good progress?\"\"Right.\"Neither Unam nor Hyun Jong knew it was easy.Jong-nam was once underfoot, but now the gap between Jong-nam and Hawasan is inexplicably wide. The weight of Jongnam's Ewha Womans University student and Hwasan's Ewha Womans University student are as different as the weight of a full-fledged rock and a feather.They say they tried through closure, but it would be difficult to win.At least I wish I didn't lose easily.'Hyun Jong's heart sank heavily.\"Unam.\"\"Yes.\"\"These are the children who are coming back from hard work. Prepare good food and release the alcohol.\"\"One\u2026\u2026.\"\"It's a day off for kids who've had a hard time training. That's fine. And shouldn't the children also know that things have changed in Hasan?\"\"That's what it is. We'll prepare it without any problems.\"\"Yes.\"\"then, bye.\"Unam got up from his seat and carefully set up an example.When Unam leaves the room, Hyun Jong gets up from his seat and opens the window. Looking out of the window at Yeonhwabong, he breathed a low sigh.Jong Nam.It's like a thorn stuck in the heart. It hurts every time I breathe, and it's going to get stuck deeper one day and break my breath.\"It's hard. It's hard.\"Winter is long and Hawaii's spring is still too far away.* * *\"Can you win?\"Yoon-jong and Jo-Gol gathered in Chung-Myung's room.If someone else had said this, I would have ignored it, but Chung-Myung's words have a different weight.Neither Yoon-jong nor Jo-Gol know. Chung-Myung has never said anything in vain. No matter how absurd it may be, Chung-Myung always kept what he said.\"We?\"Chung-Myung clicked his tongue at the two.\"Not now.\"\"Huh? Even if you're this strong?\"\"The death penalty has gotten stronger.\"\"Right?\"Chung-Myung made his thumb and index finger float.\"This much?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Hey, I'm kidding. It's not like this.\"\"Of course!\"\"Of course it is.\"Chung-Myung just doubled his thumb and index finger.\"That's about it.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol, who was blushing, eventually jumped up and pointed a finger at him.\"Hey, we've been rolling around to kill ourselves, and it doesn't make sense that we're only that strong! I feel it with my body.\"\"You'll freeze to death after a few months of rolling!\"\"No, it's definitely stronger than it used to be\u2026\u2026.\"\"How can an acorn grow three times as big as a tree?\"\"Yes.\"Chung-Myung is giving an honest assessment.The growth of the three great disciples is scary now. Never seen Chung-Myung grow at this rate. That's how much I craved and scooped up, but if I don't improve, he's even more amazing.But...There's still a long way to go.'Compared to Hawasan's three great disciples in the past, there is a long way to go. And it's the same for Jongnam.It's true that Jongnam of the time was hard to compare to Hwasan, but it's still an old file room. If he still maintains his skills at that time, no one can beat Jongnam's three great disciples.\"Is he the only one?\"'Jo-Gol is just as likely to win if you meet your opponent well. I need to meet Yoon-jong better.Only two of the three great disciples. If you compare it as a whole, you don't have to think about it.\"Then how do we win?\"\"You can count.\"Yoon-jong frowned.\"It will be as long as 15 days to the Hasan branch. How can you catch up with an opponent in 15 days after months of training?\"\"That's why I asked.\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"Chung-Myung grinned.\"Are you ready to die?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"No, it's....\"Why don't we just hear what the hell's going on?\"\"It doesn't matter. The important thing is, are you prepared?\"\"No\u2026\u2026.\"As soon as Jo-Gol tried to say something, Yoon-Jong cut him off and opened his mouth.\"I'm ready.\"\"The death penalty!\"Jo-Gol raised his voice, but Yoon-Jong didn't even look at Jo-Gol.\"I don't know what other death penalty is like, but I'm prepared. And maybe most of the other kids are prepared.\"\"The death penalty, but what he's doing...\u2026.\"\"I know.\"Yoon-Jong was as determined as a cucumber.\"But that doesn't matter. I'm dead if I die right now, and I'll never see it again. I still dream about the Jongnam guys laughing on my chest.\"\"\u2026\u2026that's true.\"The two have already represented the Hwajong Branch two years ago. And I've experienced a crushing defeat.How can I say that humiliation?\"If I could return the humiliation, I would risk my death. It's not a no man to live with it. I'd rather return and go down the mountain, I'll never see that again.\"Jo-Gol nodded, too.Listening to Yoon-jong brings back the humiliation. It's something I don't really want to experience again.\"Well, yes, and I'll let you win, death penalty.\"\"I believe.\"\"All right.\"Chung-Myung grinned.But Jo-Gol, who was nervous, asked what he shouldn't be asked.\"By the way, Chung-Myung.\"\"Yes.\"\"Can't you tell me that's the way it is now?\"\"Oh, it's nothing. I'm just gonna change the way I train.\"\"How?\"Chung-Myung answered in a nonchalant way.\"Executive.\"\"Huh?\"\"If you've built it up, you should use it now. I'll show you how to use the body.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol's eyes shake slightly.\"Uh... What if it's how to use it?\"Chung-Myung shrugs.\"You know that. You're supposed to learn martial arts by rolling with your body. Get ready. I'll start right away from this evening.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"They were two people who had a hunch something was going wrong.* * *A late night.The three great disciples were gathered in the smoke field.\"Do we really have to get together at night?\"Jo-Gol pouted and grumbled.Now, there are no adults who do not know that the three great disciples train themselves at dawn.At first, there were some people who expressed concern about the training, and there were some who questioned the training method, but now that the training has been going on for months, everyone seems to do so.Ungum, the official owner of the white plum house, recognized the effect and prevented interference.So now, it is okay to train during the bright day, but Chung-Myung only sticks to training at dawn like this.\"But what the hell are you trying to do, death penalty?\"\"Nandal?\"Yoon-jong shrugged his shoulders.Everyone is complaining about training at dawn, but every single one of them is lining up with me.Now everyone knows it. Chung-Myung's training is extreme but effective.Chung-Myung has made a boast that he will make it strong, so I'm sure it will be the same this time.\"Did you all get out?\"Then Chung-Myung looms up to the curb.The three great disciples looked at him with a mixture of excitement and fear.I'm sure I'll do something ridiculous again this time, but I'm sure it'll produce results if I can make it through.Now, they were all three great disciples who trusted Chung-Myung with a subtle feeling.\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161. But the training I'm going to do this time is...\u2026.\"It was then.It's growl.Chung-Myung pulls out the sword from his waist.\"\u2026\u2026.\"A real sword?\u2026Huh?That looks like a real sword.Chung-Myung's sword shines blue under the moonlight.Even if an ordinary man holds a real sword, he is subtly scared, but it feels like his heart is pounding because a crazy man is doing that at night.\"Oh, training?\"Chung-Myung asked back nonchalantly. And slowly approach them with a sword in his hand.\"It's nothing. It's just...\u2026.\"The corners of my mouth are going up.\"You can die once in a while. Nothing much, huh?\u2026\u2026what? That crazy guy.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The three great disciples desperately turned away from Chung-Myung's eyes.\"I...\"Chung-Myung's mouth leaks a voice that sounds like it's coming from hell.\"I don't want to lose to Jong-nam.\"His eyes glisten with madness.You're going to pee.'\"No, that kind of guy came in and...\u2026.'\"He's even crazier today. Is it because it's Boreum?'\"People have pride. How could you lose to the end of the war?\"Even if everyone else fell for it, Chung-Myung couldn't admit it. Even if you lose to Jong-nam who didn't do anything, you'll still be sick, and you'll be punished by the evil men who stole the plum blossoms?I'm glad I didn't die suddenly from a vase.\"The death penalty must be won. I'll make it that way.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Everyone was desperate to get out of Chung-Myung's spell somehow.But when people are gathered this much, there must be at least one person who doesn't know what's going on.\"By the way...\"It was Jo-Gol.He asked with wonderless eyes.\"What did you mean earlier? What do you mean, we can die?\"\"Oh?\"Chung-Myung smiled as he watched Jo-Gol coming back.\"Death penalty, death penalty, come out.\"\"\u2026\u2026me?\"Jo-Gol raised his finger and pointed to his face.\"Yes.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol looks around a little. Other death penalty are nodding happily at him.Jo-Gol's mouth opened wide with a rush of betrayal.Bad guys.Where did you take all the loyalty of the death penalty and sell it? Before that Chung-Myung came to Hawasan, there was a strong loyalty to help each other, but when did this place become so harsh?\"Get out of here, come on. Quickly.\"\"Large, big brother.\"Jo-Gol last looks back at Yoon-Jong, who coughs in vain and nods.\"Get out of here.\"\"This dog...\"There was no backbiting.Eventually, with his head down, Jo-Gol trudged forward like a cow being dragged to the slaughterhouse. Yoon-jong seemed to see a leash wrapped around Jo-Gol's neck.Chung-Myung says while looking at Jo-Gol coming forward.\"You said you wanted to count, didn't you?\"\"\u2026\u2026right.\"\"It's actually a little strange to say\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung smiles. It's kind of bleak to see the guy with the knife smiling.\"The executions have already been strong enough.\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"\"The training I've done has not been futile.\"Jo-Gol narrowed the gap between the eyes.\"Not a chance for Jong-nam yet?\"\"Well, I guess so.\"Chung-Myung rolled his brain still.Did you say that Isong Baek is one of the strongest students in Jongnam University?'The other death penalty against Isong Baek certainly seemed to be the strongest of them all. To infer the level of the three great disciples based on the basis of him...\u2026.'That's similar to what I thought.'Jo-Gol can compete, and Yoon-Jong needs luck. But the other three great disciples will never win.Of course, competition can vary sharply depending on the physical condition and luck of the day, but unless luck follows, the three great disciples of Hwasan will not be depicted beating Jongnam's three great disciples.\"But it's not because the death penalty is weak.\"\"\u2026\u2026then?\"\"I made a body, but I'm doing the same thing as before.\"\"Huh?\"Body?Jo-Gol sneaked his head down and looked at his body.'It's different.'Thanks to Chung-Myung's training and taking the medicine, the three great disciples became so strong that they could not lose any weight in sound.When I look at the muscles that are split, I can't help but smile.Of course, it's not just good to look at.After adjusting to the training, they all realized that their bodies had become several times stronger than in the past. The black is fast and strong, and the lower body is rock-solid.\"But it's the same thing. What's wrong with what you're doing?\"\"I'm telling you that from now on.\"Chung-Myung smiled and approached Jo-Gol.The play.Chung-Myung's sword scratched the floor and made a grating sound. Jo-Gol gulps his dry saliva and looks at Chung-Myung approaching.\"Death penalty.\"\"Huh?\"\"Why do you think capital punishment learns swords?\"\"\u2026\u2026it's him\u2026\u2026\"The answer is already there, as Hwasan says.He controls his body through the sword, and ends up reaching the limit. The sword at the gate is just a way of training to get to the province.But he wouldn't want an answer like that.'If I say this for no reason, I'm sure I'll get cursed at for saying obvious things.So...\"Isn't it to defeat the opponent?\"\"Wow!\"Chung-Myung clapped.\"I can't believe that's the answer from the death penalty's head. What a surprise. Thank you for the typical black man's answer, which is not suitable for the doe.\"\u2026\u2026I should have just said the obvious answer.Chung-Myung nods his head.\"You're half right. It's to win. So what do we have to do to win with the sword?\"\"Why don't you just get stronger?\"Jo-Gol, who noticed that no matter what the answer was, was swearing at him anyway, answered without hesitation.\"That's it.\"But this time, Chung-Myung unexpectedly admits Jo-Gol's answer.\"You can be stronger. If you're stronger than your opponent, you win. I mean, it's a different meaningful.\"\"\u2026\u2026it's a little hard to understand.\"\"Simple.\"Chung-Myung grinned and lifted the sword.\"Now, the death penalty and I are going to work. Try every possible means of capital punishment. I'm just gonna do one punch.\"\"\u2026\u2026Really?\"\"Yes.\"Jo-Gol narrowed the gap between the eyes.\"You're ignoring me too much, aren't you?'Jo-Gol has already had numerous experiences with Chung-Myung. No matter how hard he tried, he knew better than anyone that it was impossible to beat Chung-Myung at this point.But this is a little different story.No matter how wide the gap is, it is a matter of pride to lose to Chung-Myung, who only uses hitting.I'll show you how strong I've become.'Jo-Gol clenched his teeth and lifted the wooden sword.\"And you're gonna go with the real sword?\"\"Yes.\"\"\u2026\u2026I'm saying this because I'm old.\"\"No way.\"Why don't you give me a clear answer?You're not going to cut me?Jo-Gol nodded with a wistful face. I'm sure you're thinking about it.\"Shall we get started?\"\"Whoa?\"Chung-Myung smiled subtlely as Jo-Gol lifted the wooden sword confidently.\"I think you've gained some confidence in the death penalty.\"\" Due to the training to death.\"\"Hmmm.\"Chung-Myung also smiled and lifted the sword.'Confidence, that's good.'He who uses the sword must always be confident. It's hard for a person who doesn't believe in himself to show his or her ability.But...It's still a little early.If I were a chicken, I would admit it, but the three great disciples are still only chicks. It is natural to be excited about Hwasan because he is developing into a rising spirit, but now is not the time to be confident, but to strengthen his inner self.Now let me know that.Jo-Gol stares at Chung-Myung with sharp eyes. If you look at the eyes, there is no other first-rate inspection.\"Be prepared!\"\"Huh?\"\"No self-interest! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"Jo-Gol screamed and jumped at Chung-Myung. His eyes were burning with self-interest, overshadowed by the word self-interest.It is embarrassing that I can see his will to die after hitting one even if he dies.What did I do so wrong?'If others heard it, they would have bitten bubbles and pointed fingers, but fortunately, no one here learned to read.Chung-Myung kicks his tongue and avoids Jo-Gol's sword.\"Burn it!\"However, Jo-Gol's sword begins to make a dizzying change, as if it were rightly expected.Falling sword.Jo-Gol was adept at unfolding the fallen sword, even though it had not been a month since the transfer began. The Falling Black, combined with Chilseongbo, was colorful and sophisticated enough for those who did not know the sword to automatically exclaim.'I'm sure he's talented.'Chung-Myung looks at Jo-Gol with new eyes.Jo-Gol is second only to none of Hawasan's, given his innate talent for the sword. Talent alone is never behind Jongnam's Isong Baek.'However.'Chung-Myung grinned.Don't you think you need to step on the sprouts once in a while to grow better?This is not self-interest at all. Only hope for the growth of Jo-Gol.Chung-Myung grabbed the sword tightly.\"You're doing better than I thought. Capital punishment?\"\"\u2026\u2026Are you good?\"\"Yes, I think Jo-Gol's death penalty is unilateral.\"Yoon-jong smiled bitterly.\"You can see it, you can see it.\"\"Yes?\"\"You're unilaterally driven, but you can't even touch the hem of your clothes.\"\"Oh....\"When others paid attention to Jo-Gol's sword, Yoon-Jeong paid attention to Chung-Myung's movements.A pedometer?It's not like that either.Just walk away when you approach, hit and miss. Chung-Myung was avoiding Jo-Gol's sword by taking every step in moderation.If you look at it, it feels like you're looking at a well-organized sword dance, not a dallyeon.Every step of the way, Jo-Gol's sword cuts Ho Gong as if he intentionally avoids Chung-Myung.\"How far do I know what he's'The only time Yoon-jong was able to deal with Chung-Myung was when he was beaten or trained with him.A few months have passed since Chung-Myung came to Hawaii, but this is the first time I've seen him performing martial arts from the side.That's why I could tell.How different they are from Chung-Myung.\"Gain!\"Jo-Gol clenched his teeth and shook his sword.I can't get caught.It's like fighting a ghost. Chung-Myung avoids his sword casually, even though his sword fills the space as colorful as petals fluttering in the wind.Just one piece.When stabbed, the sword stops in front of an inch, and when struck, it passes by the inch of the shoulder. And when swung, the mere flick of his head turns all the changes his sword makes into nothing.It's gloomy.When I played Chung-Myung before, I didn't even know how to lose. But isn't it different this time? I can't even touch my collar even though I'm doing my best.Jo-Gol clenched his teeth and gave the sword a bearing.\"Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"Jo-Gol's sword glows blue.\"Sword?\"\"The priest's sword?\"The voice coming from behind Jo-Gol's back was out of reach.Jo-Gol developed the sword of death solely with the determination to cut Chung-Myung. but\"That's it.\"At that moment, Chung-Myung suddenly steps forward and lifts the sword above his head.Jo-Gol looked.The sight of Chung-Myung lifting the sword.In a slow-moving world as if time had stopped, only Chung-Myung's sword is moving slowly at its own pace. Just natural motion, like the wind blowing and the water flowing water.'What about this?'The sword that pointed correctly to the sky stops.AndAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!Chung-Myung's sword falls over Jo-Gol's head with a groovy sound that sounds like tearing up his eardrum.'Dying...'Jo-Gol couldn't close his eyes and looked at the sword hitting his head. At the moment, the life he has lived so far passes by in front of him.Chung-Myung's sword touched Jo-Gol's head before even realizing it was a taillight.Screaming!Then the sword stops touching Jo-Gol's forehead with the sound of a leather drum popping.Flop.Sitting on the floor, Jo-Gol looked at Chung-Myung with a soulless face.Chung-Myung smiled and opened his mouth.\"How does it feel to be dead?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"It's like... ..I think it's a little boring.Uh... well.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How sweaty it is, it's hard to open your eyes.Soon my body began to tremble.What if it was an inch deeper?'No, I don't need an inch. If the sword had really stopped a little further down, Jo-Gol would now be a body with a split head.\"Uh...\u2026. Uh-huh.\"I wanted to swear, but I can't speak. I couldn't control my trembling body.Chung-Myung grinned at Jo-Gol like that.\"How do you like it?\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"\"How do you like it?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"What do you mean what?Normally, I might have been able to find words to answer, but Jo-Gol now had no spirit left.\"Feeling like you've died?\"\"This...\"Jo-Gol squeezes out the last of his powers.\"Puppy like a foal...\u2026.\"\"Giggling.\"Chung-Myung didn't show any signs of displeasure after being cursed.It's a matter of course. Jo-Gol must feel like he's back from hell. If he had the strength to carry the sword, he would have rushed to kill Chung-Myung.\"Now, the death penalty is a little off.\"Chung-Myung turned around cheerfully. Then he turns to other death penalty people who look at him with tired eyes.Flinching.The death penalty that met eyes is all sneaking down.\"Death penalty, death penalty. Give much thought to it.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Is it possible that it doesn't fit?\"That son of a b*tc*.'How did that kind of person come into wasan's'\"Is that what a do-in would say?\"'Looking at Chung-Myung's performance, I could be sure that the Taesang Labor Army would also pour out their passionate insults.\"Come on. Don't drag your time. If you think it's me, let's get out. What? Ambassador?\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yoon-jong looked at Chung-Myung with a dazed look and turned his head slightly.\"Why don't you go out, Jonghak?\"\"Huh? Death penalty. I think he called the death penalty.\"\"So you're not going out?\"Jong-hak bowed his head as Yoon-jong glared.'Every human being has become weird.'Still, there was something called ambassador-like dignity for Yoon-jong in the past, but something has definitely become strange since Chung-Myung came. It's not like Yoon-jong is the only one who's gotten weird.\"Won't you go?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply when he saw the death penalty scuffling.\"It's a shame. The death penalty to help each other fight this battle.\"'That's for who, man!'\"Have you sold your conscience beforehand?'\"Without you, we're happy.\" Without you!'Desperate cries could not bring themselves to speak out.Looking at them, Chung-Myung nods as if not to worry.\"In essence, the death penalty is one way to unite. Brothership grows automatically when you all go through the same hardship. Don't worry about it. I'll do it fairly for you.\"What?Chung-Myung lifted the sword.\"If you don't come, I'll come. I'm coming!\"Don't do it, you freak!Whether everyone was appalled or not, Chung-Myung rushed to the three great disciples, spilling the ore. The three frightened disciples ran away screaming, but Chung-Myung chased the death penalty like wolves chasing sheep.\"Aren't you coming?\"\"If it were you, would you go? You crazy man!Yoon-jong, who was screaming, closed his eyes when he saw a knife falling into his head.\"Uh...\u2026.\"\"Sigh...\"The three great disciples scattered around the smoke ground trembled with their eyes mesmerized.\"Oh, my mother...\u2026.\"\"Father, I'll live a good life\u2026\u2026.\"\"Under the bed... I hid beef jerky.\"\"Can you think of anything like that now? Now?\"Chung-Myung clicked his tongue at the scattered death penalty.\"You did something great.\"Although he would have been angry at the usual time, he did not even have the energy to stand up to his current three great disciples. The experience of seeing a real sword falling upon one's head at a terrifying speed, died when it died, and never wanted to do it again.Yoon-jong stole the sweat flowing down his eyes with trembling hands.'That son of a b*tc*...\u2026.'It's Yoon-jong who's been beaten countless times by Chung-Myung, but this is a little different. It really feels like I pushed my foot into the threshold of the underworld and managed to get out.Chung-Myung looked at everyone and opened his mouth.\"How do you like it?\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"Jo-Gol, who was the first to get his act together, answered hard.\"Why couldn't you stop him?\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"\"It's an obvious strike. Why didn't you stop him?\"You mean you did this to say that?Jo-Gol exclaimed in tears.\"Because he's fast! You can't stop it because it's so fast and strong that you can't stop it. That's what a three-year-old kid would know!\"\"Really?\"Chung-Myung smiles as if he is satisfied.\"You know it well.\"\"This...\"Jo-Gol gritted his teeth.\"But why don't the death penalty do that?\"\"Huh?\"Jo-Gol looks at Chung-Myung with blank eyes. Just as he is about to say something to refute, Chung-Myung lifts the sword and hits it down.Screaming!Dust rises on the floor with the sound of air tearing.\"Simple, isn't it?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"It is not just Jo-Gol.Now other death penalty were standing up and looking at Chung-Myung's sword.\"\u2026\u2026is this the sword I saw?\"\"Yes.\"\"How many times faster was it? Didn't you do it gently?\"\"It's the same, the sword that falls on my head and the sword that I watch from the side cannot be the same.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol was a smart guy in his own way. Therefore, I could quickly understand what Chung-Myung meant.\"You mean I can do it?\"\"That's enough.\"Chung-Myung lifted the sword.\"Look.\"And then hit again.Screaming!Jo-Gol carved the figure firmly into his eyes. It's certainly not like invisible speed or great technology. It's just a quick, plain straight line, hitting the sword with no unnecessities.Hold the sword and strike.As soon as the simple movement was done perfectly, the sword man became a painting.Jo-Gol unwittingly mouthesitatingly.\"This is a strike.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol burst back into silence.\"If you've built a body, you've got to use a sword to match it. First of all, the lower body.\"Chung-Myung stompes on the floor.\"Based on the rigidly fixed lower body, lift the strength up to the waist, transfer the strength to the fingertips, integrate it with the bearing, and hit it at once.\"Screaming!Chung-Myung smiles.\"Easy, huh?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"After hearing Chung-Myung's explanation, Yoon-jong opens his mouth with a heavy voice.\"I see what you're talking about. So it's better for us now to wield the sword succinctly based on a disciplined body than to pursue a clumsy, fancy sword?\"\"There's a blow.\"Chung-Myung supplemented Yoon-Jeong's explanation.\"I need a determination not to brandish the sword twice. If you don't kill me at once, I'll die.\"Yoon-jong sighed.'That's why you showed me everything.'It is said that a hundred words are a sight. There's a huge difference between dealing with a sword with a single stroke and hearing it in words. It would not have been easy for people here to understand if they had never experienced Chung-Myung's sword falling on their heads.\"One, Chung-Myung.\"Yoon-jong said with a heavy sigh.\"I don't know what you mean, but we are disciples of Hawasan. Would it be meaningful to win this way?\"\"What is a disciple of Hawasan?\"\"Wouldn't a disciple of Hawasan take down his opponent with the sword technique of the right man?\"Then Chung-Myung looked at Yoon-Jeong with dumbfounded eyes.\"What have I done now?\"\"Drop.\"\"What's the first herbivore of a meat joint?\"\"\u2026\u2026slash down.\"\"Well, isn't meat the kendo of Hawasan?\"Chung-Myung looked at it with a sour eye, and Yoon-jong coughed loudly.\"I was short-minded.\"\"Tsk, tsk, tsk.\"Chung-Myung kicked his tongue and looked back at everyone.\"Meat is the foundation of Hwasan, the foundation of Hwasan. Everything in Hawasan starts with meat and ends with meat. By the way!\"Chung-Myung glared his eyes, and those who were stabbed turned their heads.\"Things that can't even open their meat properly are already falling flowers, or even the swordfish!\"\"Hmmm.\"\"Oh, the night air is cool.\"\"The moon is bright.\"The three red-faced disciples looked elsewhere.\"You have to know it right.\"Chung-Myung's voice sank low. In the tone of his banter, the death penalty stares at him with serious eyes in unison.\"If you can't cook the meat properly, there's no point in learning other swordsmanship. It's based on all the black meat of Hawasan. Buildings that don't have a foundation can collapse even in small winds. Capital punishment first needs to make what they have perfectly theirs.\"Everyone nodded.I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with my eyes. But haven't they already been through with their bodies?'The fallen sword, which seemed so strong, could not stop a single sword.'A simple strike seemed like the best sword technique in the world.'It's not the sword that matters, it's the man who uses the sword.'Jo-Gol stood up and looked at Chung-Myung.\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161.\"\"Yes.\"\"Let me ask you one question.\"\"Yes.\"Jo-Gol sort of organized his thoughts and immediately opened his mouth.\"I know what you mean by meat is important. But we are not you. It may sound silly, but right now we need the power to knock Jong-nam down their noses rather than the strength of the distant future.\"\"Hmm.\"\"You're the only one who can pull this off with meat. That's why I'm asking.\"Jo-Gol shone in his eyes.\"If we do as you say, can we beat Jongnam?\"Chung-Myung sighed instead of answering.Jo-Gol bit his lips slightly as he looked at his reaction.I know it's pathetic.'He who learns martial arts is not a Jo-Gol who doesn't dwell on private competition and doesn't know he has to look far away. But losing to Jong-nam was an experience I never wanted to do again. That sense of humiliation...\u2026.\"What did the death penalty take me for?\"\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung glitters his eyes.\"You're losing to Jong-nam? Such a man doesn't deserve to be alive. Where's the student of Hwasan? He's defeated by a scoundrel like Jongnam! I'm going to smash your head!\"Jo-Gol trembled looking at Chung-Myung's eyes, which were glistening with life.'No, we are, but why are you in Jongnam?'The guy who just got in wasan.\"I told you, I'll let you win.\"Chung-Myung picked up the sword and pointed to the death penalty.\"There's no such thing as a good defeat.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Winning is all about fighting. Bite your pant leg or sprinkle dirt on your eyes! If you win, it's over! Cowardly? Funny thing to say! You think a man who's been decapitated on the battlefield can talk about cowardice? I'll win by all means!\"It was Chung-Myung, who nonchalantly made a declaration that would bubble if the adults of the private sector heard it.Jo-Gol grinned at Chung-Myung like that.This guy used to be like this.'I felt somewhat relieved.\"So what do we have to do now? How can I use a sword like you?\"\"It's simple.\"Chung-Myung rolled up the corners of his mouth.\"Let's start with hitting 10,000 times.\"\"\u2026\u2026are you kidding me?\"\"No way?\"\"Just kidding.\"\"Ay.\"\"Joke... ...\"Chung-Myung smiles.\"Will you lose and die? Do you want to die now?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Maybe there's a bigger enemy in Hawasan than Jongnam.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is not the greatest season, but the sword smears with dizziness.It will take a lot of time to unfold this sword skillfully, but just learning it so far has been enough to confirm that the sword is one level above that of other Hawasan.'Hwasan will be stronger if he can deliver the sword properly.'The times will be stronger, but future generations will be stronger.Just thinking about it made it hard to suppress the constantly blooming smile.\"Hmmm.\"Woon-gum quickly rubs his hands around his mouth.\"This is really difficult.\"Still, teachers should be seen strictly by their students, but these days, I keep smiling.How could you not?The hardships of the three great disciples in Hawasan cannot be called hardships. Ever since I entered the mountain, I've had a hard time with my disciples.They devoted all their youth to Hawasan. He overcame hardships and overcame the pain with the collapsing Moonpa on his shoulder. After those long, long dark days, light was finally beginning to appearance.I can't say Gwangmyeong yet.'I'm just starting to see the light. The Ungum was also well aware that there was still a long way to go.Nevertheless, it was thanks to the three great disciples who recently began to grow strangely fast.Private servants and the death penalty seem to have no greater joy in the fact that Hawasan's finances have improved and that he has regained his past martial arts, but fortune is different.The growth of his disciples was the most important thing for him, the official of the White Plum, and it was also the greatest pleasure.'The children are different from us.'Today's great disciples also tried, but unfortunately, Hawasan's situation did not create an environment where he could concentrate on martial arts. And to be honest, they weren't very passionate about martial arts either.But now the three great disciples are more passionately committed to training than any of Hawasan's so far.\"Hmm.\"With a pleasant nasal sound, the Ungum wore a sword around his waist and left the soft armour with a cheerful step. It's time to train the children.His mind was filled with pleasant imaginations.If the environment of Hawasan, which is no longer in need, and the new martial arts, and the passion of the three great disciples were combined, there was a high possibility that he would be revived splendidly.And the main characters will be the three great disciples.\"I'll have to work harder to make it happen!\"How can you be a teacher if you can't lead your students who are trying?Turned around the corner and entered the curb, the Ungum shouted with a bright face.\"Come on, do your best today\u2026\u2026. What's this, crazy!\"The Woon sword was frightened and backed away.In front of his eyes, there was pure and simple chaos.\"Turn it off...My arm... my arm!\"\"Oh, my waist...\u2026. I'm breaking my back\u2026\u2026. Back!\"\"Sa, save me. Save... ...\"The sword rubbed his eyes unconsciously.Do you mean what hell is this to a smokearm that should be filled with dreams and hopes and burn with passion for the future?The three great disciples were all lying on the floor, holding wooden swords. The twitching shoulders and saliva flowing out of the mouth give us an idea of what happened.\"What the hell is this....\"At that moment, the sound of life still remained in the ear of the Ungum.\"Hoooooooooo!\"The sword's head spins. Jo-Gol, who took off his top and was hitting with a wooden sword, caught my eye.\"Jo, Jo-Gol\u2026\u2026.\"\"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoooooooops!Sweat is pouring down the whole body like rain. Every time I hit the sword, sweat spewed everywhere, and hot breath sprouted out of my mouth.Bloody eyes and trembling shoulders tell how hard he is now. Even Ungum, who saw it for a moment, feels stiff shoulders and legs shaking legs.\"Come on, one more.\"The eyes of the Ungum turn slightly to the side.What the hell is that?'Next to Jo-Gol, Chung-Myung is holding the sword slowly. Unlike Jo-Gol, who sweats like rain next to him, Chung-Myung's appearance is refreshing.The robe is neatly refined and not a single strand of combed hair is disheveled. He was swinging his sword with a relaxed face, unlike the death penalty, which looked like he was about to die.\"Just swinging isn't the end of it. Think of it as a single swing, squeezing all your strength from tip to toe, and carrying a sword! One more time!\"The sound of rolling wheels creaking in the head of the funeral sword resonates. I feel like my head is pounding because I don't understand the situation.What's that situation?Isn't Chung-Myung the youngest of the three great disciples? But why is Chung-Myung teaching Jo-Gol?In the meantime, it was more problematic that everything he said was correct.\"Now, just one...\u2026.\"\"Screaming!\"In the end, Jo-Gol, who couldn't stand it, falls on the floor and wriggles. Chung-Myung clicked his tongue at the sight.\"Tsk, tsk. It's because you're so weak.\"Chung-Myung sighs deeply.\"I'm just overworking my body. I'm doing it, too. Use your brain! Use your brain! Think about how to wield all your strength into the sword!\"What?The eyes of the sword trembled.The other death penalty may not be known, but the Ungum knew to some extent that Chung-Myung was taking over his three great disciples. It's hard to understand, but isn't there often a talent beyond age in the world?But what Chung-Myung is saying now is not just because he is talented and capable.You mean he has a good understanding of martial arts?'The more I see it, the more amazing it is.Waking up out of his mind, the Ungold shook his head.This is not the time for this.\"What the hell is going on?\"Chung-Myung turned his head away when Ungum shouted.\"Oh, my lord!\"Then he comes running to the Ungum.\"Did you visit last night?\"Watching the scene, the three great disciples root their teeth.\"That son of a b*tc*!\"\"If he had entered the palace, he would have been faithful and left in history.\"\"You're a human horse that'll bend if you stab him with a needle.'Is there any way that a man who usually lived with a wall of courtesy can't turn his stomach upside down because he is so polite to the sword?In particular, Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong, the biggest victims, were looking at Chung-Myung with a face of dejection.\"What's going on here?\"\"I've been training.\"\"Training? This?\"No, training is training. Because I saw Jo-Gol wielding a sword with my eyes. But the result is...\u2026.\"Turn it off.\"\"Department, my lord...\u2026.\"\"It's... it's so hard. I feel like I'm going to die...Here we go\u2026\u2026.\"The three great disciples look at the teacher like a dog in the rain. The crybaby raised its voice unconsciously at the sight.\"Training is part of the process of training the body and raising the level. Don't you know that too much can poison you? And you...\u2026.\"\"I know, my lord.\"\"Huh?\"The voice of Chung-Myung, who cut his own horse, opened his eyes slightly. Don't you think you've cut off the words that will lead to a proper answer.\"But I didn't start this training. The death penalty will never be humiliated at the Hwajong branch this time.\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026Tuesday, Hwajong Branch?\"Yes, Hwajong branch is not far away. That's true, but...\u2026.\"The death penalty seems to be swallowing the powder while reflecting on the disgrace of the last Hwajong Branch...\u2026.\"Bunru?The Ungum turned his head and looked at the three great disciples.Behind Chung-Myung, the children shake their hands desperately. Looking at it, it was a rhyme rising from the inside.\"They don't look that way.\"\"Ay, that can't be true. How can you be proud to be a student of Hawasan if you are beaten up by the scum of Jongnam? There's a pride in Hwasan!\"What?That's right again, isn'\"You can lose once. But isn't it impossible to lose twice? A disciple of the Grand Hwasan faction loses to Jongnam.\"\"\u2026\u2026right.\"Confusion began to settle in Ungum's head.There are only two things he values most in the world. One is pride in Hawasan, and the other is to raise his disciples properly.Now the two problems begin to fight pointing fingers at each other in their heads.Chung-Myung, who read such a verse, sneaked up on him and whispered low.\"Think about it. The best way to honor Hawasan is to strengthen the death penalty and knock them out of their noses.\"\"It's him\u2026\u2026.\"\"Then the elders will also praise the hard work of the Sasookjo.\"'You're such a troubleman.'It wasn't that I didn't know Chung-Myung was gently enticing him. But what I hear is so sweet. I appreciate your hard work, and I don't care about it, but to beat Jong-nam...\u2026.\"Do you think it's possible?\"The fortune-teller asked without realizing it. The word has so many meanings.Chung-Myung smiles after hearing Ungum's question.\"I'm Chung-Myung.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The Ungum still looked at Chung-Myung and coughed.It's none other than Chung-Myung who changed these kids. Didn't the children in a rut change only months after they met Chung-Myung?Maybe now we need this process rather than learning one more sword. No matter how lucky the sword is, it's impossible to teach them to beat Jongnam's disciples from now on.'One more time...\u2026.'The Ungum looked around and opened his mouth.\"Listen, the disciples.\"\"Yes, my lord!\"The three great disciples paid attention to the sword with pathetic eyes. The last hope, pure and simple...\u2026.\"There is no place for me to be proud of you guys showing so much passion. It's up to me to train you as it is, but it's not right to disturb you from training so voluntarily.\"\u2026it's collapsing?Oh, hope is falling apart?\"I will leave the training to myself until the Hwajong Branch is held. In the meantime, you don't have to come out to the curb. However, you should be careful not to damage your body.\"Master Guan?\u2026... this isn't it? What? Guanju?\"Well, then go ahead.\"The fortune-teller spins his body.Some of the three great disciples unwittingly stretched their hands forward and folded them slowly when they saw Chung-Myung's eyes.Soon after, as Ungum completely moved away from the training center, Chung-Myung turned his body around and twisted his head.\"Come out, who said he was having a hard time with the governor.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Hurry up.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The eyes of the three great disciples were filled with despair as they saw Chung-Myung pulling out a wooden sword from his waist.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It takes a lot of work.\"Chung-Myung climbed the mountain with a face that he didn't like.\"This is how slow it is.\"Chung-Myung sighed heavily.He has never raised a disciple in his previous life.Even the death penalty of Cheon Mun, who was bent on somehow rolling Chung-Myung, could not bring himself to raise his pupils.The death penalty of Cheon Mun told priests who were worried about what if Chung-Myung's swordsmanship could not be handed down to future generations.- I'm worried about that, too. One, I'm a human being, so I can't have my disciple under him. Anyone who wears a pharynx can't bear to do that. What crime did the children who go into his disciples commit and deserve such punishment? If you are really a master of polishing the province, such harsh words are not in your mouth.Since then, the priests have never asked Chung-Myung to accept discipleship.'I feel bad thinking about it. You bastards?What's wrong with me? You're raising them so well!Of course, it takes a hell of a lot of work.Raising Chung-Myung's three great disciples was no different from teaching toddlers with a grown-up adult holding on to a child.If there's anything else, one thing. If the child is left alone, he or she will walk, but they only understand what baby steps are when they hold their feet and take one step at a time.\"Yeah, I'd rather die than suffer.\"As a result, it took more time than expected, and as it took time, there was not enough time to train. Now I almost have to give up my male sleep to make time for training.Chung-Myung sighs deeply and looks up at the sky.\"Long death penalty. Do I have to do this? It's comfortable for me to play drums and janggu by myself.\"Then do it.\"Oh, come on!\"Chung-Myung sighed heavily.He, too, knew well that regaining Hawasan's film was impossible on his own.Making Hwasan's name famous?I can do that much by myself. But Chung-Myung can't live forever, can he? You don't need a movie to disappear when you die.What Chung-Myung has to make now is the spirit of Hawasan that will continue even if he is gone.The movie is as colorful as a petal, but quickly grows, and the spirit does not show up as roots, but keeps the tree alive.\"I know\u2026\u2026.\"How can that be easier said than done?Chung-Myung smacked his lips.As I climbed the mountain while organizing my thoughts, I arrived at Nakanbong. Chung-Myung's gaze quickly looks around.She's not coming back then, is she?'It's time to celebrate. It's time for everyone to go to bed. No matter how crazy you are about training, you won't come out of prose at this hour to train.Of course, we ran into each other later in the day, but it was her return to Wasan.\"You don't have it, do you?\"Chung-Myung, who sifted through the area, lifted a wooden sword with a waist.His eyes slowly sink after stretching the sword and taking the upper position. The playful eyes when teaching children disappear, and the eyes of the prosecutor who has gone through the countless battlefields with the sword replace them.\"You're going to take me back?'No. That's not enough.Chung-Myung broke the whole foundation. He denied the history he had built in his previous life and filled the place with a new history.To go further.But that alone is not enough. I changed my history, but I couldn't change my sword. If the sword doesn't change, his sword will just become stronger.It's getting stronger, faster. Only then does nothing change.Did I beat Heavenly Demon?'No.If Heavenly Demon hadn't run out of steam at the end of the great mountain, Chung-Myung would never have been his match.It was Chung-Myung who talked about the Hawaiian First Sword and the Heavenly Demon, but couldn't win a single person alone.What if I could have beaten Heavenly Demon alone?'If I did, no one would have died.Both the long death sentence and the priests would have returned to their homes to protect Hwasan. A peaceful routine of long death sentences chasing Chung-Myung and priests secretly leading to the death penalty.Both the death of everyone in Daesan and the fall of Hwasan would not have happened if Chung-Myung were strong.Regret?It's not like that.I don't have a hobby of holding on to things that are already in the past and wailing. The problem is in the future.Where is the guarantee that someone like Heavenly Demon won't come out again?'Maybe someone more horrible than Heavenly Demon is after the stronghold again.To save Hawasan from all that crisis, we must be strong. More than anyone else in the world, than Chung-Myung in the past, and Heavenly Demon!To do that...\u2026.Chung-Myung's sword was almost perfect in the past. Nevertheless, it was not able to withstand Heavenly Demon.'Why?'Because you didn't sharpen your sword more?No.\"No matter how sharp a tiger goes toenails, it can't catch a flying bird.\"Because I didn't cross the line.Heavenly Demon's philosophy destroyed everything he believed to be right. Like laughing at Chung-Myung, who thought that just following the path made by the good man could reach the end.Just as a man who stuck his foot on the floor looked at a flying animal in the sky, he had no choice but to look at the point where he could never reach.If you want to go beyond Heavenly Demon, you have to fly beyond yourself in the past.But how?Chung-Myung's eyes sank.I'm throwing it away.But I don't throw it away.You have to empty it to fill it up. Hana Chung-Myung has already emptied everything in her new life. Then we have to refill it now.Then what will you fill?Is it Hwasan's or Chung-Myung's Or...\u2026?\"It doesn't matter.\"Chung-Myung's sword begins to move slowly.Protecting wasasan's? Throw away everything in Hwasan? Or Chung-Myung's?- They're all obsessed.That's right. Capital punishment.If it's natural to fill, it's natural to throw it away. There is no need to think hard about what to fill and what to throw away.purpleThe Black knows. Doesn't it flow?I don't draw the line.The moment you decide what to take and throw away, the black is bound to be trapped in the limits created by itself. Leave it alone. As the sword wants. And as Chung-Myung wants.Chung-Myung's sword drew a soft line.At the same time, a plum blossom begins to bloom in the sky.Although it is Hawasan's plum blossom, it was different from Chung-Myung's drawing so far.It's a little more lively, a little gentler.Stretch out, scatter, and sink.From east to west and back to east.The plum blossoms that began at the end of the sword bloom in a flash. Soon after, the pure white flower that covered all the Nakanbong Peak brought spring to the late night.Soft, fast, flashy and beautiful.However, the plum blossoms soon fall into loneliness.At Nakanbong Peak, where everything was fantasy again, only Chung-Myung, who stretched his sword, closed his eyes still.I think I'll catch something.'It didn't sprout. But I feel like I've got the clue.Chung-Myung's sword, which became the sword of Hwasan and transcends the sword of Hwasan.A sword that can move beyond his limits, beyond the limits of Hawasan, and into a new place.\"Hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooah.Chung-Myung sighs low.It can't be easy.'I am not inventing a new prosecution. It's a new frontier work. It's still a long way off even for Chung-Myung. Just as Chung-Myung's history grows with him, so will this sword.Now it is just a plum blossom peak.But one day...\u2026.\"Well....\"\"Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!Suddenly, Chung-Myung was frightened by the sound from the side and stepped aside.\"Wow, Ciba, what the f*ck!\"Before I knew it, there was someone else standing together on Nakanbong Peak. Scared Chung-Myung blinked and identified the person.'\u2026\u2026isn't that the girl from last time?'Yu...u...u...u....What was it?Oh, right! Yoo-Esul! That's the name.Yoo-Esul was looking at Chung-Myung with subtle eyes. With slightly loosened eyes.\"No, but how does he get out of my sight and get here?'No matter how much you spread your sword without knowing, is it Chung-Myung for no reason? Even in a trance, Chung-Myung can feel as if he is holding the gas in the surrounding dozen pages with his hands.But the last time I saw his signs, and now I'm by his side without any problems, and something's wrong with her?\"No, you've mastered the art of assassination! How come you can't get a sign?'Come to think of it, his presence is strangely faint even though he is right in front of him. If you try to feel it deliberately, you can't feel it well.If you see people with your eyes and listen to them with your ears, there will be no problem, but this happens because you are more familiar with the sense of humor than with five senses.Looking at Yoo-Esul staring at him, Chung-Myung agonized fiercely.How am I supposed to fix this? How far did they go?'For now, try to gloss over...\u2026.Then Yoo-Esul slowly opened his mouth.\"Plum Blossoms...\"You've seen it all.It's rotten.Her head tilts slightly to the side. He doesn't understand what he saw.Yeah, yeah.Don't continue to understand.Chung-Myung grinned.Anyone else would have been embarrassed, but who is Chung-Myung? It's an accident that's never happened again in Hawaiian history.Didn't the death penalty of Cheon Mun say that Chung-Myung had more accidents since the beginning of the history of Hwasan than before Chung-Myung's initiation?This is nothing to Chung-Myung!Let's do it naturally. Naturally, as if nothing happened.He bowed his head towards Yoo-Esul.\"Have you had an accident?\"When Chung-Myung takes a step closer, Yoo-Esul flinches.Huh? Why did you flinching?Yoo-Esul looks at Chung-Myung with slightly serious eyes.\"Homicide Extinction?\"\"Is this crazy?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Oh...Naturally, you're out of the question.Chung-Myung, who unwittingly cursed, raised his hand and closed his mouth.Another white porcelain boat is still coming to Hawasan, why does this woman come in advance and bother people so much.There is only one way now.Chung-Myung waved and quickly escaped Nakanbong.\"Then I'll be going!\"\"Oh... wait!\"There was a voice trying to catch him, but Chung-Myung neatly ignored it. When you can't make excuses, it's best to avoid it unconditionally.Yoo-Esul's hand reaches out to Chung-Myung's back. Sink slowly.\"Plum Blossoms...\"She gazed at his back with blank eyes and clenched her fist slightly.\"You scared me!\"This is obviously Chung-Myung's mistake.But on the other hand, being caught doesn't really make a difference. I tell everyone what she saw. Because no one will believe it.But from now on, you have to be careful. One witness hears that the witness is out of his mind, but three witnesses can summon a tiger.\"When the white porcelain ships come back, I'll have to be careful of my training.'Oh...It's not just training, is it?Chung-Myung nodded with a determined face.\"There's something to do before the white porcelain ship arrives!\"He began to walk down the mountain gate at a quick pace.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Come this way, please. I'll guide you to a good seat.\"How's everything?\"Oh, my. What's the big deal? Thanks to Confucius' frequent visits, the business is going well and worth living. Hahahaha.\"Chung-Myung headed to the window seat under the guidance of Jeomsoy.\"It's a cool towel. If you wait a little longer, I'll serve you the soju you always drink. What would you like to have for dinner today?\"\"Give me a couple of the right ones.\"\"Yes, I'll talk to the chef and prepare the best food for today.\"Not the best one, but the most delicious one, dude!Who are you trying to catch?However, Jumsoi rushed to the kitchen and brought out two bottles of chilled soju.\"Here you are.\"\"Oh, thank you.\"Chung-Myung opened the lid and poured it into the glass as soon as he picked up the soju.The sound of alcohol spilling in makes me so happy.This is why people live.'No matter how much Chung-Myung is a human being who has kicked Doga's laws, he cannot drink alcohol in Wasan as a third-generation disciple.Drinking is not completely prohibited, but drinking within the prose is strictly prohibited.But whoever Chung-Myung is.A man of the frog belt who must do what he is told not to do, and what he is never allowed to do.'If you tell me not to eat weirdly, I want to eat more.'The two bottles of alcohol from the cave had been out of stock for a long time, and now it has become a daily routine to change clothes and stop by the base every time I come down to the chord with the privilege of a long-time writer.Now, Jumsoi pretends to be the first to know how often he came. Shame on you!\"Growl.\"Chung-Myung, who poured a glass of alcohol into his neck without delay, hung on the chair with a face as if he had come to heaven.\"Why are there so many things you don't want to do when it's all natural? People have to make sense!\"Anyway, what a warrior they are they?What?I'm a master, too?Come on. I'm a little different.Chung-Myung poured another drink to his mouth. Then, he doesn't hold his breath and just looks at the glass. Chung-Myung, who was looking down at the sparkling alcohol, slightly smiles.\"Not the same as before, death penalty.\"Alcohol was the best when people hid away from the eyes of the death penalty who were looking for Chung-Myung with a light in their eyes.\"I'm here like this.\"There's no one here.Looking at the glass, Chung-Myung finally smirked.It's a weird thing.I've never missed someone who would sit across from the glass in my life, and now I'm looking beyond it.\"Tsk.\"But that doesn't mean I'm deeply impressed.What's past is just what's past. If the death penalty sees him wondering, they will hold his stomach and laugh.That's the way they are.It was called \"a Taoist who realized the high degree\" or \"a living spirit,\" but in reality, they were just playful old people.The same goes for Chung-Myung.\"Well, here's Sampisa. And here's Daryo.\u5e36\u628a?It's ).\"Sampisa is a dish that is seasoned with the skin of the five-bone family, pork, and jellyfish, and Daeryo green onion is a dish that boiled down jokbal. Both were traditional foods of the island island.\"What about the frozen pork?\"\"It's coming soon.\"Chung-Myung picked up his chopsticks, smacking his lips.It's not as good as the delicacies on the table right now, is it? After drinking a glass of soju and eating cold vegetables, it is like heaven.This is the lineage.'The fable is freezing to death.Death penalty, I don't split. Live happily there.Then the door opened and a series of crowds entered.\"Welcome home!\"Jumsoi rushed to the door.Those who came inside were all young men and women.Are you too old to be a young man?'Men seem to be separated, and women certainly look younger than him.Anyway, Chung-Myung looks like a bunch of blood.Those who came inside looked around and sat down on the table next to Chung-Myung. Chung-Myung didn't care about them and diligently teased them with chopsticks.\"It's been a while since I've had food.\"\"Now I can't eat any more, death penalty.\"\"That's why you didn't come here? It's important to climb the mountain as soon as possible and greet the private servants, but they'll understand.\"Capital punishment or private residence?Chung-Myung lifted his head slightly and glanced at those who put their backs down. Come to think of it, they're all wearing black suits. And the chest was embroidered with plum blossoms symbolizing Hawasan.Is it a white porcelain boat?Wearing a robe embroidered with plum blossoms, it is Mundo in Hwasan, and Chung-Myung has never seen it, so the white porcelain belly will fit. He's about the same age as well.Chung-Myung lowered his head.I didn't do anything wrong, but I don't want to show my face. I don't want to get involved. Fortunately, I'm wearing casual clothes now, so if I don't get tangled up, there won't be a problem.'You don't even let me eat properly. Let's hurry up and eat and go out.'There can be no such thing as the joy of meeting a junior.He's a pain in the ass, he's a pain in the ass. It is best not to get involved as much as possible.\"But what about you?\"\"I think I went up to Hawaii first.\"\"Weren't we supposed to meet in harmony?\"\"When do you ever listen to a similar sibling?\"\"Well, then the masters must have thought we were here.\"\"It's okay. Everyone knows the similarity is unique.\"\"That's a relief.\"The young man in the middle called Jeomsoy to finish a simple order. Then I ordered a drink to fill the cups of the death penalty.\"Jeo-jeo.\"Chung-Myung frowned.\"Now they're finally drinking in the middle of the harmony. Even if Munpa turns upside down, it's oil!'Anyway, these days!Yes?Me?No. I'm different. I'm almost a hundred years old...\u2026.Move on, move on.\"You all did a great job. You overcame the hard training well.\"\"Who else has suffered as much as the death penalty? We just followed the death penalty.\"\"That's right. The death penalty worked the hardest.\"The tall young man in the middle smiles.\"You're handsome.\"Chung-Myung, a man, looks warm and cozy. The painting is captured by wearing a black coat on it.How should I say this? It's like a legendary collaborator in a story.\"I know better than anyone that you've ever worked with. This alcohol is for me personally, so don't feel pressured and drink as much as you want.\"\"Thank you, death penalty.\"\"But don't get too drunk. Because I have to go up to Hawasan in the evening.\"\"Of course.\"The sound of laughter is jingling up.So on my way back from training, I guess I'm having a drink while I'm in harmony. Maybe that one called the death penalty is the great disciple of the white porcelain ship, and the rest are the great powers of the white porcelain ship.Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to drink so confidently in a place where other people might see it.'Moonpa is working well.'Chung-Myung gave a slight sniff.It was hard to imagine that they would drink among themselves when he was a high school student. He would have been stuck in a penitentiary and would have had to swing his sword at the wall for a week.So Chung-Myung hid and drank!Yes?Yeah, I did drink it. How can you not eat that?But basically, I was hiding and drinking! It's not like that!Chung-Myung, whose thoughts were unknown, began to collide with glasses and share drinks. The atmosphere begins to heat up as the food is served quickly and the table is filled.Let's just eat and go.'In the midst of a tumult, Chung-Myung quickly teased the chopsticks. And as soon as he poured a glass of soju neatly, a remark that could not be ignored penetrated his ear.\"Baek Cheon to death.\"\"Say it, priest.\"\"After all this hard work, we can get good results at Hwajong Branch, right?\"A person called Baek Cheon crosses his arms and nods slowly.\"\u2026mmmmm.\"\"Right, capital punishment?\"\"Priest. Honestly, I don't know. But there's one thing I know.\"\"What's that?\"\"Try never betrays a man.\"Baek Cheon's eyes shed a clear light.\"We've done enough to try. He overcame the hard training and constantly whipped himself. Isn't it true that even if we don't win, we've gone a long way in that time?\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"\"Don't hang yourself on winning or losing. We're playing a long game. If you lose your eyes to the immediate outcome, you may lose the distant future.\"\"Oh... I was short-minded.\"\"But I want to win.\"Baek Cheon smiles softly. When a smile was made on his handsome face, it felt like the surroundings were brightening up. All of his students looked at him with trust.But then there was one with a rotten face.Did you put oil on your mouth?'Chung-Myung gulped down Sohongju with a sour face. Chung-Myung doesn't fit the sound of his mouth.I think it's something different from the death penalty.'It was the same with the death penalty for ranting, but it's something different. But it's not like I did anything wrong...\u2026.\"How good are we at this? Can you fight against the disciples of Jongnam now?\"\"Well.\"Baek Cheon opened his mouth with a serene face.\"Jongnam is strong. Isn't it an old file room, in name and reality?\"\"Yes, you are.\"\"In the past, we were also members of the old faction.But, frankly, now Jong-nam and we are incomparably different.\"Everyone's face turned dark at the words of Baek Cheon.\"But that's just fame.\"Baek Cheon's voice is slightly raised as if he is trying to refresh the atmosphere.\"Fame and skill are not necessarily proportional. Although we lost the last Hwajong branch, the difference was not significant. During that time, didn't we concentrate on training while reducing our sleep? Now, Jong Nam will be able to compete with him.\"\"You mean the Jong-nam?\"\"Where was Jongnam from the beginning? Where was Hwasan from the beginning? Nothing is set in stone. If we can move forward without rest, it will not be impossible to look beyond the end of our generation to the world.\"A powerful voice and determined eyes. It was definitely an attractive figure.It was a moment when everyone was looking at Baek Cheon with touching eyes.\"Pfft!\"There was a low sneer coming from behind.The heads of the six people sitting at the table turn to one side in unison.\"Uh...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung, who realized that the eyes were on him, covered his mouth with an awkward face.'Oh, I didn't know.'I heard something so absurd that I burst into laughter.In everyone's eyes, Chung-Myung quickly came up with a breakthrough as usual.'Let's move on naturally.'And I started coughing violently.\"Pu\u3164\u315c!! Pu!! Oh, my! Coughing! Is there something in your throat? Pooh!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung frowned at the way he looked at himself.Why aren't you fooled? Your acting is perfect.'Cough more intensely...\u2026.\"Small brothers.\"\"What?\"Baek Cheon slowly rises from his seat. Then he stared at Chung-Myung and opened his mouth.\"Who is the little brother? I don't think I've seen this face in harmony. If you don't mind, may I ask your family and name?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"I think we're screwed.You see?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And in the case of children in shopping malls, they enjoy the culture from a young age.The problem is that this place is in harmony.As far as he knows, there is no masterpiece in the chords, no descendants of the prestigious family, and no restraint in the rich shopping district. It is not Chung-Myung's age, though.So who the hell is that kid drinking alone in the chords?\"Cough.\"The child coughed low and shook his hand.\"I'm just a passerby. Don't worry about it and finish what you've been eating.\"\"I'm a passerby.\"Baek Cheon's eyes bend gently.\"Well, that's possible. Small medicine. We met here. Why don't we name each other? I'm Baek Cheon, the great student of the Grand Hwasan.\"Chung-Myung sharpened his teeth behind the hand covering his face.\"No, you son of a b*tc*? Why are you so persistent?I can't beat him up.There is no burden of making a kite by shaking off the back of the celadon or drying it, but it is not a white porcelain belly.If the fact that Chung-Myung beat Baek Cheon like a mouse spreads in Hwasan, the long-term writer will pack up his seat and lie down, and Ungum, which has become more nagging these days, will likely run wild to cut Chung-Myung down.Then everything Chung-Myung has built up will collapse.'You can't do that.'You can't get involved with a young man for nothing. Chung-Myung coughed a couple of times.\"I don't have a name to put forward\u2026\u2026.\"\"When it comes to conversation, I don't think it's the right of the superior to cover his face?\"What kind of a mastermind is that? Then you'll be in office, you son of a b*tc*!It was Chung-Myung who was emotional, but for now, avoiding his body is the first.Chung-Myung crept up from his seat.\"Then I'll be going.\"\"Stop right there.\"\"See you next time and we'll talk.\"Chung-Myung, who was trying to turn around, grabbed the bottle on the table. And bow your head with your mouth covered.\"Good-bye.\"\"Mini, I'd like to talk to you a little bit more?\"\"I don't have a hobby of peeling nogari with a man. Of course.\"As Chung-Myung rushed to the entrance, Baek Cheon quickly reached out, hardening his face.'Where!'The moment his hand tried to hold Chung-Myung's hem.Let's start.Chung-Myung naturally steps aside, and Baek Cheon's hand cuts Ho Gong.\"Huh?\"\"Good luck!\"Chung-Myung rushed out of the glass.Baek Cheon looks blankly at where Chung-Myung left.\"Dodged?\"He obviously managed gold at the last minute. Although not the pinnacle, it was too much of a trick to grab a child.But you avoided it.\"Why didn't you catch him?\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"\"Didn't you let go at the end?\"Baek Cheon's face was embarrassed.How do I answer that?\"\u2026\u2026I thought it wasn't up to a master to persecute a young child.\"\"You're like the death penalty. Haha.\"Baek Cheon had an awkward smile.\"It must have been a mistake.It is clear that he was relieved by the fact that he was tired from his long journey, or that he arrived in Wasan.If he'd been good at it, he wouldn't be able to catch that little kid.\"I thought there were more people in the harmony, and now there are more faces I've never seen before.\"\"It's not even a small chord, so we can't all know. If you are meant to be, you will meet again.\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"Back Cheon smiled and went back to his seat.But his smile wasn't as bright as it was a while ago.* * *\"Oh, shit!\"Chung-Myung kicked the stone.\"Why are you crawling in there? There are a lot of other glasses and lots of bases. Anyway, if you don't want luck, you'll break your nose even if you fall backwards!\"What a waste.It makes me upset to think of snacks that I haven't finished. How much is that?\"I'm glad you brought me a drink.\"Climbing up Hawasan, Chung-Myung drank from a bottle.\"Oh, it's so catchy.\"It would have been better if there were only snacks.Chung-Myung smacked his lips and threw an empty bottle into the corner.\"Yeah, it's a hell of a climb.\"I can't get used to this mountain no matter how many times I climb it.'By the way, it's a white porcelain boat.'People who were not part of Chung-Myung's plan suddenly popped up. Of course, just because they show up doesn't mean it's gonna bother you...\u2026.It could be a little annoying.'The reason why Chung-Myung has been comfortable living in Hawaii is because he has made a tremendous contribution and is given preferential treatment implicitly. But it is not just that.The biggest reason why Chung-Myung thinks is that the age difference between Unja-bae and Celadon-bae is extreme.Compared to the Unja ship, which has all gone beyond fifty, there are only young children who are only twenty years old. It's hard to keep up with the unja ship chasing each and every one by one, it's hard to save face.This is how the top rider does it.The scariest person for a fresh recruit is neither a general nor an emperor. It's the jockey. Isn't it human nature that a dirty senior is scarier than a distant mastermind?But I have a senior who I thought was not there.\"Yes, a white porcelain boat.\"First of all, the first relationship was made weird.\"Hey, I shouldn't have laughed there.\"But I couldn't hold back my laughter.Baek Cheon's words were so absurd.\"Catch Jong-nam?\"On that subject?Chung-Myung kicked his tongue.The three great disciples of Jongnam were the only ones that's all.\"Oh, my. Capital punishment. This is an era in which such things are installed as disciples of Hawasan. What? These days! Whew!\"When I saw the three great disciples, I was less shocked.How much would children learn when they learn martial arts? Even if I had learned proper martial arts, it wouldn't have been much different at that level.However, Lee Dae-dae says differently.The three great disciples should lay the groundwork, the great disciples should grow up through training, and the great disciples should enter a hard-boiled. And when you are an elder, it is standard to complete your own path of martial arts.Yeah... that's the standard.\"Oh, my God.\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply.Looking at the disciples of Ewha Womans University, I feel upset. They're also members of Hawasan, so Chung-Myung should hold them...\u2026.\"It's not time for me to waste my time like this.\"Seeing the students of Ewha Womans University makes me more urgent.\"Well, how many years do they make a fool of themselves?\"It was still a long, long way off.* * *\"Jo-Gol's death penalty! All three great disciples should gather at the smoke range.\"\"Why?\"\"Housekeepers are back.\"\"Well, I see. Did you tell the Ambassador?\"\"Yes! He'll be right back.\"\"Got it.\"Jo-Gol dressed up in order.Come to think of it, it's about time the sun set.I wonder if he's back.'Jo-Gol opened the door and went out and opened Chung-Myung's door.\"Ku-ha... Drung, ku!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung scattered on the bed was a speechless Jo-Gol. Lying down like a heavy drink...\u2026.\"Did you really eat it?\"I think I smell alcohol somewhere.Surprised, Jo-Gol rushed to Chung-Myung, grabbed him by the shoulder and shook him.\"Chung-Myung! Priest! Priest Chung-Myung! You crazy...\u2026.\"\"Huh?\"\"\u2026\u2026Oh, no. Forget the last one.\"It wakes up in a very appropriate.\"They're all here because they're back. Hurry up and wash up. You look terrible right now.\"\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\"Chung-Myung stretched himself out.\"I guess I dozed off when I took a break.\"It's not sleeping.Chung-Myung, there's no such thing as a dozing creature in the world. You have to lie down and say you're sleeping.\"You wash up first...\u2026.\"\"Hoops!\"When Chung-Myung added a little shout, the smell of alcohol came out. When Jo-Gol was about to say something...\u2026.'Huh?'The smell of alcohol that had pervaded disappeared at once. I sniffed and smelled it, but the same is true.\"Huh? Where did you smell the alcohol?\"\"Alcohol, holy cleanliness, what a mess, death penalty. You'll be punished by heaven.\"\"\u2026\u2026No, I'm sure\u2026\u2026.\"\"Let's go. I'm going to get kicked out late.\"It was a very unfair Jo-Gol, but for now, Chung-Myung was right, so he hurried to follow without saying nothing.\"But why are we going out when we're returning to this school?\"\"But you're welcome. They're coming back from a tough closing.\"Hard closure is freezing to death.That's not the case with the closure.We're gonna put him in a lightless penitentiary for two months, three months, and we're gonna eat moss and swing a sword.'Oh, I did some training.'I'll do it.\"How dare a young man and a woman pair up with each other, wielding a knife, and cheeky training in their mouths.\"It wasn't like that back in my day! When I was young!It was inconceivable in Hawasan a hundred years ago.\"This time he really sharpened his sword. So Jang Moon-in made up his mind to apply for training. I'll press Jongnam's nose somehow.\"\"Really?\"\"Yes, Baek Cheon strongly requested it.\"Chung-Myung snorted.\"Yes, yes.\"\"You have to be careful of your attitude, too. Baek Cheon's private education is very strict, so if you act like usual, you'll get in trouble!\"\"Yes, yes.\"\"It's real.\"\"Yes, yes.\"Leaving Jo-Gol, who looked angry, Chung-Myung walked toward the prose. By the time Chung-Myung arrived, there were already quite a few people.Long writers, elders, and ships all came out of the hall. Everyone lined up in the prose waiting for the white porcelain boats to return soon.\"Here it comes.\"\"Open the prose.\"The stylishly newly built gate opens from side to side. Soon, Hawasan's great disciples, dressed in black suits, walked in proudly.\"Oh!\"\"You've changed your spirits.\"\"It's great.\"The boats admired, and the celadon boats applauded. And wise men welcomed their disciples back with a pleased face.There was only one person who was insensitive.'When will it end?'I have to go eat.Baek Cheon, who was leading the disciples of Ewha Womans University at the forefront, smiled and responded to the welcome.'Wow, that's a good picture.'As expected, he's handsome even when I look at him again.In the past, Chung-Myung also heard a lot of sounds. When I get dressed up and go down to the village, the beautiful girls...\u2026.- Conscience.\"Oh, come on.How dare you scold me for my hearing.It was the moment when Chung-Myung shook his head and clapped.\"Huh?\"Baek Cheon's eyes, who accepted the priests' greetings, are fixed on Chung-Myung. Baek Cheon, who paused for a moment, tilted his head slightly.After watching Chung-Myung for a long time with strange eyes, he soon comes right in front of Chung-Myung and smiles.\"Maybe...\"A grinning stranger, Baek Cheon, stares straight at Chung-Myung and says.\"We've met before, haven't we? Compact?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Do you really want me to smash this?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To the point where I wonder why all this guy crawled into the ruined Hawasan.The problem must be that he's hanging on Chung-Myung's ankle now.\"What do you mean?\"Let's back out for now.\"I think I know.\"\"I have no idea.\"\"Oh, really?\"Baek Cheon tilted his head slightly. It's more of an exaggerated act that provokes Chung-Myung than a clueless act.\"That's weird, it's like we've met before. When did you get in the door-to-door?\"The answer was not Chung-Myung, but Yoon-Jeong next to Chung-Myung.\"I was introduced while my cousin was away from Hasan. I don't think you've ever seen it.\"\"Well, I see. Yes.\"Baek Cheon grinned.\"For that, you seem to be close to each other things like that. It's good to take care of the youngest as an ambassador. Don't you think so?\"\"Yes, private residence.\"Yoon-jong replied in an awkward voice. Baek Cheon nods as if he had read something in the answer.\"Maybe I'm meant to be with you. I've never seen you before, but you look so familiar. I think we'll see each other more often. What's your name?\"\"It's Chung-Myung.\"\"I'm Baek Cheon. Make sure to remember my name.\"Then a firm voice flew in.\"How could you say that we have a private chat when the long man is waiting for us!\"\"Oh, I'm sorry. Wait a minute.Baek Cheon bowed his head to the sword and greeted Chung-Myung with a wink. Then turn around and join the ranks towards the smoke and mirrors.Jo-Gol watches the scene and whispers to Chung-Myung.\"Have you ever seen a Baek Cheon private residence?\"\"Nothing.\"There is but there isn't.\"Be careful, Baek Cheon is one of the greatest disciples of this university. He's a great guy.\"\"Great?\"\"I'm telling you.\"Yoon-jong added to Jo-Gol's comments.\"It's a man called Hawasan First. He's said to be the one who's going to rebuild the crumbling Hawasan.\"\"Hwasan First Journal?\"I think I've heard that a lot in the past. I mean, I, uh...\u2026. I used to say that a lot when I was a snitch.Soon, he became the most mischievous one.\"Wasn't the first journalist in Hawaii the death penalty?\"\"What are you talking about, someone else listen!\"Jo-Gol turned his face red, not like him.\"Baek Cheon is a man I dare not follow.\"\"Oh, yeah, yeah. A sense of defeat is a good thing. It makes people humble.\"\"Huh?\"\"No, death penalty.\"Chung-Myung gave a subtle look as he looked at Baek Cheon walking ahead.Military Ilhak.'That's a good thing. That's a very good thing to say.But it's not really a very nice thing to say.When the egret is in the egret, it is a natural law. It is very unnatural that the egrets are among crows.And most of the time...\u2026.I mean, there's a flaw.'While Chung-Myung, who was a little interested, observed Baek Cheon, Yoon-jong continued to explain.\"It's said that we're almost at the point of hard-boiled eggs in advance of the time of Baek Cheon's death. I heard that the superiors have high expectations. Even though he's still young, there's a saying that he's considering transferring the Bokho Cheongyang sword.\"\"Hmmm.\"Perhaps Hwasan is the most important disciple among the great disciples.'That's a lot of work.'So did Chung-Myung in the past.I don't know how much you have to learn. Others train moderately and go rest, but Chung-Myung comes to the elder and asks for help, and private servants come to him. Even the death penalty...\u2026. No. Is there anything missing from the long death penalty.That's a fair thing to do.It is said that the name of the Moonpa is to build up with history, but the rise and fall of the time often depends on only one master.If even small and medium-sized literary groups can produce a famous master, they will be crowded with people who want to enter. On the other hand, no matter how big a person boasts history and tradition, if he fails to produce a master worthy of his name, only flies will boil.The only way to reverse the failing Hawasan is to produce a master that anyone admits. Only one. If only one person comes out, we can reverse the situation.'Of course it was until I got here.'Now, what?I have a lot of money.\"Don't you think the private houses are really picturesque?\"\"I mean, I don't know if I can keep up with it forever.\"\"It's cool, it's strong.\"Chung-Myung looked at the two with vain eyes.\"Are these eyes a hoop holes?\"'Let's just say that's cool. It's personal territory. People's tastes are various laws, and Chung-Myung was a right man who did not impose his tastes on others.But being strong is one thing.\"If they're strong, there's no one weak in the middle of the country.'\"Well, the death penalty will be enough to win.\"At Chung-Myung's words, Jo-Gol laughs as if he is dumbfounded.\"What the hell is that?\"\"\u2026\u2026uh, yeah.\"Death penaltyLong death penalty.I live by hearing this kind of course. If you have any conscience, please come down and say something! Do you think I'm going to buy this because it's unfair?Other fresh people come to this world and give advice. What's the point of capital punishment that's so lacking that you can't come and tell me about yourself?What?You're not going to take my side even if you're fresh?Come on!While Chung-Myung quarreled with the death penalty, the white porcelain ship had already completed its line-up.\"Huh?\"And not on the prose side, but on the battlefield side, a person often comes running and joins the ranks.Chung-Myung squinted his eyes.'That was a white porcelain boat, too.'You... What was it? Anyway, funny.As it is intertwined with strange relationships, it is inevitable to pay attention. Don't tell me you've been babbling that stupid little muzzle in a day?When Chung-Myung frowned and looked at Yoo-Esul, Jo-Gol smiled insidiously.\"Come to think of it, you've never seen an accident before.\"\"Him?\"\"Yes, Yoo-Esul accident. I can't take my eyes off you when I see you for the first time. Because she's so beautiful.\"\"Metabolism.\"\"Huh?\"\"Do you happen to have any Sancho powder or cinnamon powder?\"\"Why?\"\"I need to spray some on my ears. It feels like oil is coming out of my ears when I hear Jo-Gol's death sentence.\"Even if it's greasy, it can't be this greasy.Yoon-jong nodded loudly.\"We haven't seen eye to eye in a while. I'll give it to you when I get it.\"\"Thank you.\"Jo-Gol distorted the impression.\"Did I say anything wrong? It's because not many people know the accident. After a couple of trips to Gang-ho, you'll be the best on the island.\"Chung-Myung sighs as Jo-Gol blinks.\"In the first article of Hawasan, in the first place of the island, in the first place of the West. People who don't know would think I'm steaming fat because I'm sick.\"\"But it's true.\"Jo-Gol pointed at Yoo-Esul with a chin.\"Honestly beautiful, isn't it?\"\"Ha...\u2026.\"Jo-Gol beats Chung-Myung before he answers.\"But wake up. Yoo accident has a heart for Baek Cheon.\"\"\u2026\u2026the death penalty.\"\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply.\"Wouldn't the death penalty have made a name for itself by now if I had swung the sword one more time when I was interested in other people's love affairs?\"\"You don't stab people that bad.\"\"Let's not talk.\"Chung-Myung looked at Jo-Gol as if he was pathetic and turned away.Come to think of it, he claimed to be an accident, and the accident seems to be right. Chung-Myung joined the ranks and glanced at Yoo-Esul standing.When the white porcelain ships are all lined up, Jang Moon-in, who was watching them, smiles heartwarmingly.\"Well done, everyone. Wasn't the training hard?\"Baek Cheon opened his mouth on behalf of the white porcelain belly.\"It wasn't hard at all. If you don't know that our training was done with bone-cutting support in the text, how can you say it's hard?\"\"Have you made any progress?\"Baek Cheon smiled.\"I realized that the road to the sword was endless. However, we came back with an achievement that would make us laugh before we started training.\"\"That's a good thing.\"Hyun Jong turns his head and looks at Hyun Young.\"Jaegyeong Footnote.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Now that Hawasan's children have returned from hard training, why not hold a feast to celebrate their hard work?\"\"What did you do to sleep...\u2026. No, it's not. Of course you should.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hyun Jong looks at Hyun Young with a subtle look.I think the priest has become a little strange lately.'The frequency of strange words has increased dramatically, to be exact, since something happened at the top of the galaxy a while ago. It is hard to tell whether the personality has changed or whether the reins have been lifted while living in a house without it.\"If not, I've prepared the restaurant. It should be enough to catch up.\"\"I see.\"Hyun Jong says while looking at the white porcelain belly.\"There's a lot I want to say, but it's not a good thing to keep those who have come a long way. If you don't have anything in particular to say, let's stop here.\"\"\u2026\u2026long man. May I ask you a question with all due respect?\"Hyun Jong had a clear sense that he wanted to end the event quickly, but Baek Cheon did not seem to.\"Ask me.\"\"It seems like the landscape has changed a lot since I came back to Hawaii after a long time, and I wonder what happened.\"\"Good things happened. Thanks to you, I was able to redecorate my appearance.\"It was a soft but conclusive answer. After hearing this answer, it is difficult to ask what the \"good\" thing was.\"I know you have a lot of questions, but you have a lot of time, so you can listen to the story slowly.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Unam.\"\"Yes.\"Unam, who stood by Hyun Jong, politely stood up.\"You help the hard-working children solve their problems.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"Hyun Jong nodded lightly and turned to one side.\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung's face is slightly distorted.\"No, but why does he keep looking for me every day by day?I don't think there's anything special going on today.\"Yes, long-time man!\"Chung-Myung walked out of the three great disciples.\"Come to my place for a moment. There's something I need to talk about.\"\"Again?\"Baek Cheon's eyes popped out watching the situation next to him.'Again...Again?'To a long writer again?Baek Cheon doubted if he had heard something wrong. But no matter how many times he thinks about it, he doesn't seem to have misheard it. All of the students in line look like him.However, what I don't understand at all is that everyone except Lee Dae-dae showed no reaction.It's not enough to run around trying to rip a man's mouth off a man with that kind of messy hair!Even the long-winded are just grinning.\"Will you come if you prepare a party?\"\"Yes, I understand. I'll be on my way now.\"Hyun Jong led Chung-Myung to his place with a happy face.Baek Cheon, who looked at the scene silently, looked back at the sword with an absurd face.\"Sasook, what the hell is that kid...\u2026.\"\"Well.\"The Woongeom laughed nicely.\"I think it's good for your mental health to just stay out of it.\"\"Yes?\"\"Especially you.\"The sword shrugged and turned away.\"Unpack and come to the restaurant. Don't be late.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes.\"Baek Cheon felt a strange sense of incompatibility that he had felt a while ago.I think something's changed about Hwasan.'Maybe it's because it's been a while since I've been here. But only one.Baek Cheon's eyes go out to Jang Moon-in and Chung-Myung.\"Hmmm.\"And he opened his eyes with a look of disapproval.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how hard it is to praise us...\u2026.\"Baek Cheon couldn't say anything even in his voice calling for himself. It was the same with him that surprised me.A feast is in front of them.In terms of secular concept, it may not be enough to call it a feast, but in terms of Hawasan, it was almost no different from the food eaten by the emperor.First of all, that.That one! That one!\"\u2026\u2026isn't it meat?\"\"Huh.\"Baek Cheon rubbed his eyes.What was in front of him now was clearly food made of evidence of the sin of killing a living animal and taking the flesh.How can something so cruel happen in cleanliness?\"Where did the money come from?\"That's what I'm saying!Where did the money come from in Wasan? Where did the meat come from?\"Well, wait a minute. Capital punishment. Come to think of it, the inside of the restaurant has changed. I thought it was awkward because it's been such a long time, don't you think something is shiny and clean?\"\"\u2026\u2026Come to think of it.\"Baek Cheon looked around. The entire cabinet is not newly built, but it certainly looks like it has been renovated. All the holes and old places that seemed to fall have been fixed.\"There are new halls, restaurants are being fixed. And now the meat is on the table!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I don't know what happened to Hasan while we were away. You don't have to be a god anywhere.\"Baek Cheon laughed in vain.What a retread! Hawasan is a land abandoned by the god of wealth.If there is only one literary faction in the world that can argue with openness over civilization, it is Hwasan.No, openness will not be worse off than wasan. Opening is just a group of beggars, but opening itself is not poor.What a fortune to have such a Hawaiian.What else is so out of place?Baek Cheon lifted his head and looked at the crying sword.\"Sasuk, what about these foods?\"\"These are the foods the Lord of the Apocalypse prepared to praise you. Eat a lot.\"Why do you sound so insignificant?Where's the private residence who's been eating grass for 30 years and thought he'd become one with the rabbit, not the sword?What was even stranger in the meantime was the reaction of the three great disciples.The three great disciples who attended the ceremony to celebrate the disciples of Ewha Womans University were not surprised even though meat was placed in front of them.I'm just looking at the table with a stern look.Baek Cheon listened slightly and overheard the conversation of the three great disciples.\"I'm tired of meat. Is there anything different? Like fish.\"\"A madman is looking for fish in the mountains. Do you want to be beaten with the head of a fish?\"What the hell are you talking about, crazy people?What? Are you tired of meat?Baek Cheon, who became frustrated when he couldn't understand the situation, opened his mouth.\"No\u2026\u2026.\"\"Khhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"\"Hmmm! Hmmm! Hmmm!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"No, I was going to open my mouth.Turning his head to the side, Baek Cheon shut his mouth at the sharp gaze of the death penalty.Let's eat first.''You must be eating meat because you're rich. We've only had a year of wall music now.'Pressed by the eyes and spirits of the death penalty, Baek Cheon coughed up and opened his mouth.\"If the elders and the elders don't come, may I have a meal first?\"\"Hmm? Oh, I didn't notice. Come on, hold it.\"\"Yes, of course.\"Woon-gum took chopsticks and put a piece of meat in his mouth. As a sign of that, the death penalty began frantically teasing chopsticks.Papapapad!The food jumps into Ho Gong.But there was nothing to worry about. The chopsticks flew to Ho Gong and snatched the fish before it even landed on the floor.Baek Cheon closed his eyes as he looked at the abyss.It may seem excessive, but it's actually a matter of course. Hawasan was the poorest people in the world, and his disciples were the poorest people in the world.All they have eaten here is a little grain powder, pine needles, and a few nuts. It was a good meal to say the least, the cheapest diet in the world.Besides, thanks to this training, I've been living off the wall for a year.Like Baek Cheon, those who have some family time can buy food with money they spent at home, but those who haven't can't have smelled meat for years already.Of course my eyes are spinning.Meanwhile, Baek Cheon's three great disciples, who are eating leisurely, come into his eyes.Looking at them nonchalant, I realize that these foods are now nothing special in Wasan.\"Sasook.\"Ungum, who was not eating, turns his head and looks at Baek Cheon.\"Why? Don't you like the food?\"\"It's not like that...\u2026. It's because he doesn't understand the current situation. What the hell happened to Hasan while we were away?\"\"I see. I didn't think of your position.\"The sword laughed.\"It's too long a story to tell now. You'll find out gradually. All you need to know is that a piece of luck has rolled into Hawasan.\"\"Blessing?\"It was that moment.Bang!The door opens wide. The disciples of Ewha Womans University, who were eating food, flinched and tried to get up from their seats. Anyone who can boldly open the door like this must be an elder...\u2026.'Huh?'\"Was there a young elder like that?'That can't be true!'Surprisingly, it was a blue child who opened the door. Chung-Myung, who followed Jang Moon-in, shuddered inside.\"Here's your seat.\"When Jo-Gol raised his hand slightly, Chung-Myung leaned his head toward the sword and headed for the seat with a thud. And those who were sitting nearby sneaked up and made it easier for Chung-Myung to pass by.Baek Cheon squinted at the sight.\"They care about him?\"'Of course it can be. If everyone is polite and nice kids.However, the three great disciples Baek Cheon knew were sincere and quick-witted, but they didn't go very well with the word \"goodness\".There is only one thing such people do naturally.\"That little one has taken over the three great disciples?'It's unbelievable.But there was too much evidence that made it hard to be true. The seat that the children left empty is the center seat, and Yoon-jong and Jo-Gol are sitting on the left and right sides of the seat.Yoon-jong is the metabolite of the three great disciples, and Jo-Gol is the strongest of the three great disciples.You're saying you're using your cause and power?'But how the hell did that little boy get them? Besides...\"Why doesn't he say anything?'That guy who kicked in the door a while ago was quite rude. You can excuse me thinking that there is no great disciple or fortune-teller inside, but if you have done so, it is polite to apologize properly.If you are a prosecutor who usually values courtesy, you should have said something. But he was nonchalantly using chopsticks as if he had nothing to do with it.The more I look at it, the less I know.'Baek Cheon shakes his head. In his eyes, Chung-Myung was seen talking to the children's eyes.\"Why are you so angry again?\"\"Go to the top of the galaxy.\"\"\u2026\u2026there again.\"\"I know. I'm not some kind of a messenger!\"Yoon-jong grinned at Chung-Myung's complaint.\"You liked it at first.\"\"That's one or two times. Yes.\"Chung-Myung is scratching his head.\"But it's a relief that we only have to deliver it to the branches in harmony, I would have lied down if I had told you to go to the West Bank.\"Seeing Yoon-jong comforting Chung-Myung and Jo-Gol giggling and poking, Baek Cheon became convinced.\"He's eaten all three great disciples.'I don't know what method he used, but it was clear that Chung-Myung had become the dominant figure over the three great disciples.In many ways.Baek Cheon put on a subtle smile.The three great disciples, Yoon-jong, tended to serve their superiors politely. I thought I would bow my head even if Baek Cheon didn't press it.But no matter how you look at it, that Chung-Myung guy doesn't seem to have that inclination.'We need to set a date.'To answer various questions.\"Metabolism.\"\"Hmm?\"\"You don't want to eat?\"\"Oh, I'm going to eat.\"Baek Cheon picked up the chopsticks. But soon he put his chopsticks down and looked around.\"Where is the simile?\"\"\u2026\u2026Well? It was there a while ago.\"The students of this university look around at the word \"Same-mae.\"\"I was there until I came to the restaurant.\"\"I think I've fallen for something else.\"Everyone answered casually whether this had happened quite often. But Baek Cheon frowned disapprovingly at it.\"Shouldn't we look it up? It is a place where the death penalty releases its circulation for the first time. It's fun to have someone who's out.\"\"There's no one who can find a similar sale, is there? If you don't want to come, you can't find anyone.\"\"I'm going to waste my time. Death penalty.\"Baek Cheon narrowed the middle of his forehead slightly.\"Hmm.\"Those who were wary of his discomfort eventually woke up with a low sigh.Yoo-Esul has a quirky side, so it's not easy to find unless you show yourself. But now that Baek Cheon has a stiff look on his face, he should at least pretend to look for it.'The death penalty favors Yoo Sa-mae too much.'A fair man in other things seemed to lose his composure frequently in Yoo-Esul's involvement.'Do it.'It's not that I don't understand. I'm just a little lazy thanks to me.It was the moment when some of the great disciples were about to get up. The closed door opens slowly.Everyone's eyes were on it.Through the sunlight pouring through the open door, a woman walks inside. A small step that doesn't even hear footsteps.\"Buying.\"Baek Cheon raised his voice.Yoo-Esul, who came inside, looked around. As if to find someone.Baek Cheon smiled and raised his hand.\"Brother, this way\u2026\u2026\u2026.\"Yoo-Esul starts walking again. But that direction wasn't where Baek Cheon was.Charity. Charity.Yoo-Esul, who often walks to one side, soon reaches his destination and stops. And I stared at the person sitting in front of me.Baek Cheon's eyes are slightly wiggling.Yoo-Esul asked the man he was staring at.\"Can I sit down?\"The disciples of this university. In particular, the men were so surprised that their eyes popped out as if they were about to fall out.\"Did a sister talk to a man?'When was the last time you heard a similar sister speak?'But the shock is not over.The man Yoo-Esul talked to, Chung-Myung, put all kinds of irritation on his face and wiggled his hands like chasing a fly.\"No, you can't.\"\"\u2026\u2026then let me talk to you for a moment.\"Chung-Myung said firmly.\"No, I don't want to tell you. Go back.\"Is that crazy?The faces of the disciples of this university were filled with astonishment.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Return of Mount Hua SectCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77: 77\"What's going on here?'Jo-Gol couldn't get his act together.It's the first time I've encountered a student of Hwasan who doesn't know Yoo-Esul exists at such a close distance.It's not because Jo-Gol is a third-generation disciple. I've never seen even his students talk to Yoo-Esul in a friendly. It was Yoo-Esul who was a student of Hawasan but a little distant.Then she was now talking to Chung-Myung right under Jo-Gol's nose. Soon, the blade-like eyes of his students pour on him.'Wow, you're killing people with your eyes.'No, exactly, Chung-Myung was being poured out and Jo-Gol was sitting next to him, but he was being beaten mercilessly by the bad guy.'Chung-Myung, please!'Use honorifics, you little prick!There are all his students here. What's up with his way of speaking?Chung-Myung was calm even though his private servants were blinding him. In an atmosphere where something is about to fly, Yoo-Esul whispers quietly as if nothing happened.\"It'll only take a minute.\"\"I'm not going.\"\"It'll only take a few minutes.\"\"I'm not coming! Don't you understand me?\"The way you talk, you punk!Jo-Gol pressed Chung-Myung's thigh without realizing it. Then Chung-Myung turns his head around.\"Why?\"\"\u2026\u2026Uh\u2026\u2026.\"You can't ask that.Uh... You shouldn't ask me like that in front of the private houses, you should have noticed.Chung-Myung, who clenched his tongue, turns his head and looks at Yoo-Esul.\"I have nothing to say about the accident.\"\"I have something to say.\"\"I don't want to hear it.\"\"It'll only take a minute. Let's go out for a second.\"\"I'm lazy, can't we just eat?\"\"Then I'll wait until I'm done eating.\"His students were on the verge of going crazy.First of all they've never seen Yoo-Esul say so much at once. No, I didn't remember seeing him talking to someone about the same age as me, not the elders.But isn't Yoo-Esul holding on to his blue temperament?Yes, the second thing that made them even more crazy was Chung-Myung's attitude.'That son of a b*tc*...\u2026.''Cause you're talking about the accident, and it can't happen right away?'\"Doesn't he have eyes?\"'He's a real doer. He's a doer.Burning anger and subtle respect pour into Chung-Myung at the same time.The first thing to do is to stay away from reason. But Yoo-Esul was easy to destroy such performance. No matter how well-disciplined he is, he will have no choice but to listen to Yoo-Esul as if he didn't win.If you look at that face and expression in front of you.But Chung-Myung was openly showing his annoyance to Yoo-Esul. This is beyond the imagination of his students.\"I'm not going! I have a lot to do. Find someone else.\"\"I came for you.\"\"Why did you...\u2026.\"It was that moment.\"Hmm.\"Although it was low, it was a voice that spread widely due to its history.Everyone's head turned to one side. Baek Cheon, dressed in white suits, stood up and smiled at Chung-Myung.\"Did you say Chung-Myung?\"\"\"Yes.\"The answer is simple once.But Baek Cheon was not angry. At times like this, getting angry is nothing but showing one's bottom.\"I understand you're tired of being on several missions after coming back from a long trip. Maybe I'm doing things I don't know. But since the accident is asking you to do so, can't you think about it at least once with the reason you're dead?\"Back Cheon, who finished speaking, smiled mildly. It's okay for him to think...\u2026.\"Why?\"Baek Cheon flinches.Did I hear you wrong?No. Did you just say why?Bewildered Baek Cheon looked at Chung-Myung's expression. Looking at the sulky face, I don't think I heard it wrong.Baek Cheon, who was choked up at the moment, managed to contain his anger.Let's stay calm.If he loses his temper here, he becomes the youngest of the three disciples.\"Did you say 'why'?\"\"Yes.\"\"There must be many reasons. First of all, people should have manners. Even priests have manners to observe.\"\"Oh, courtesy?\"Chung-Myung nods his head as if he knew it well and calls Yoo-Esul.\"Accident.\"\"Huh?\"\"Apologize quickly. They're saying it's rude.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yoo-Esul raised his finger and pointed at himself.\"Yes, I apologize quickly.\"\"Me?\"\"Well, you don't understand.\"Chung-Myung explained it step by step.\"This is a place to celebrate the return of a great student. It's not polite to ask for a personal favor and do something personal.\"\"Oh....\"Yoo-Esul nods as if he didn't think of it. Then he gets up from his seat and bows his head towards Baek Cheon.\"I'm sorry, death penalty. I didn't think that far.\"\"Oh, no, buy-in. It's not that...\u2026.\"Baek Cheon bit his lips tightly.Why did the story end up like this?As soon as he somehow opens his mouth to pick up the pieces, Chung-Myung whispers again behind Yoo-Esul.\"I'm sorry, not you. I'm sorry, sir. I made a mistake while I was at the dorm.\"\"You're right.\"Yoo-Esul lowered his head again toward the sword.\"My disciple was thoughtless.\"The sword is smiling.\"You're saying all sorts of things. Sit down, I'm fine.\"\"Yes, private residence.\"It was Baek Cheon who got in trouble when Yoo-Esul sat down. At the moment, he couldn't get a clue what to do.I woke up bravely...\u2026. It's embarrassing to sit down again now that it's settled in this way. Aren't the three great disciples now looking at Baek Cheon, expecting what he will say?What if I just sit there looking at her like this?Baek Cheon's appearance is ridiculous.He coughs low a couple of times and fixes his eyes on Chung-Myung.I can't.I have to stop him.'Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong exchanged glances.It's hard to beat Chung-Myung with a knife, but harder to beat him with words. This guy has no logic. To win a war of words, one pushes all sorts of sophistry and uses logic as logic.If the conversation gets longer here, Baek Cheon may really go crazy. Only that needs to be stopped.\"Congratulations on your return, sir!\"\"It's a great day, isn't it? Now that the private servants have returned from training well, Hwajong Branch has no problem.\"Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong desperately changed the subject.I'm not trying to protect Chung-Myung. It was just because I didn't want to see Chung-Myung and Baek Cheon catch up from the first day and Hwasan become a mess.Baek Cheon glanced at Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong.In their desperate eyes, Baek Cheon opened his mouth slightly squinting.\"Did you say Chung-Myung?\"\"Oh, you consistent human being!\"You don't know the reverse. I don't know the reverse.'Understanding that it was impossible to stop Baek Cheon, two people reached out and grabbed Chung-Myung's hem.Hey, please let's move on. Be polite just once...\u2026.Did he read that desperation? Chung-Myung's mouth opened.\"You must have had a hard time traveling a long way.\"Oh?Yoon-jong and Jo-Gol opened their eyes wide. How long has it been since Chung-Myung's mouth said such polite words...\u2026.\"Seeing you ask me again. Do you want to rest?\"It can't be \u2026. Yeah, that can't be true.d*mn consistent bastard.Baek Cheon's eyebrows are wiggling.\"One question, haven't you really met me this afternoon?\"\"Never seen you before.\"\"You'd better be honest.\"\"Hey, it's my first time. Did you buy it without being fooled?\"No one would think that Chung-Myung was lying when they looked at his sparkling eyes.Except for the three great disciples.Except for the rhyme.Uh.... A student of this university may think so. Uh... well.\"Really? If you ask, we'll know.\"Baek Cheon turned around and took a swipe at the Ungold sword. I didn't want to do this, but if I don't break Chung-Myung's nose here, it'll only make him laugh.\"Sasook, I saw that child in harmony this afternoon.\"The eyes of the sword wriggle slightly.\"Really?\"\"Yes, as far as I know, the three great disciples are prohibited from escaping from Hasan. But alone, it's certainly a shame that he came down to the chords in plain clothes, not in uniform. So we're going to investigate if anyone saw that kid in Hawasan this afternoon...\u2026.\"\"It's all right.\"\"Yes, the investigation is...\u2026.Huh?\"Baek Cheon, who was bowing his head with one ticket, raised his head.Did I hear you wrong?No, I think my ears are weird today. I keep hearing weird noises...\u2026.\"I said it's okay.\"Baek Cheon looked at the Ungold sword with a puzzled face.The cloud sword is the coffin of a strict white plum. It is not strict because it is the official residence of the White Plum. He became the official owner of the white plum house because he was originally sensitive to rules and strict.He is now clearly saying that he is OK with the three great disciples who have broken the rules of Hawasan. What the hell is going on here?\"Household, private residence?\"\"He is allowed to leave the prose without the permission of his superiors.\"\"Huh, permission. Who the hell can give a child that authority?\"\"The long man got off. Is there a problem?\"\"Now, the long\u2026\u2026\"Really?\"Surprised, Baek Cheon hurriedly covered his mouth with his hands. It is not polite to ask the truth of what the private residence said, as well as the way he speaks. It was Baek Cheon who keeps making mistakes today.\"So it doesn't matter.\"Baek Cheon's stunned gaze turned to Chung-Myung.Chop, chop, chop.\"\u2026\u2026.\"I would have been less angry if I had been looking this way with a sneering face. Chung-Myung, however, was quickly making fun of his chopsticks and inhaling food as if he was not interested in this series of events.Baek Cheon bit his lips.It's going to the end.'Now that I've come this far, I don't intend to take it easy anymore.Baek Cheon opened his mouth again with a knife, and one person came inside as the door opened.A man with a layer of cold ice on his face. It was Hyun Young, the financial footnote. He strode inside and looked around.\"See you, Elder.\"\"See you, Elder.\"When everyone stood up and greeted him, he shook his hand as if it was annoying.\"There you go. I'm having fun. I shouldn't have come. I'm here to check it out. Eat as much as you want today and relax. I'm leaving. Don't let the children play too hard.\"\"Yes, private residence.\"Back Cheon, who was standing then, opened his mouth.\"I have something to say to the Elder.\"Hyun Young, who was about to go outside, turns his head and looks at Baek Cheon.\"What's going on?\"\"I'm sorry, but I saw the three great disciples here drinking alcohol at the base of harmony this afternoon.\"\"Alcohol?\"\"Yes!\"Hyun Young's face is distorted.\"The three great disciples are drinking! Did you see it right with your own eyes?\"\"Obviously, he says no, but I saw it clearly.\"Baek Cheon covered his face slightly with a photocopy and rolled up the corners of his mouth.It sounds a little cheap, but that's the first one to provoke. So I'm gonna have to do this.\"Who are the three greatest disciples you've ever seen?\"Baek Cheon turned his eyes to the side and checked Chung-Myung's face. He's pretending to be calm, but he's probably burning to death.'Don't blame me.'This is about establishing the law for Hawasan.\"I'm Chung-Myung, the three great disciples.\"\"\u2026\u2026who?\"\"I'm Chung-Myung. That Chung-Myung over there.\"You can't know each of the three great disciples by the elder. Baek Cheon reached out to his hand and pointed at Chung-Myung.Looking at Chung-Myung on Baek Cheon's fingertips, Hyun Young frowns. Then he opened his mouth with a face of irritation and anger creeping up.\"What's that?\"\"Yes, that Chung-Myung drinks...\u2026.Huh?\"\"What's that?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"What?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how long the writer gave that child the authority to go down to the chord alone, what authority would that power be used to drink? I think we should punish them.\"Then Hyun Young's head slightly tilted.I think you got it right this time.'Then he'll...\u2026.\"You don't understand what you're saying.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes?\"Hyun Young spoke without hiding his anger.\"Do you set the rules of Hawasan?\"\"Well, that can't be true.\"\"So was there a clause in the Hawaiian discipline that you say you should not drink outside of prose?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Baek Cheon couldn't bring himself to open his mouth.No, there is no such provision.I don't know why, but which literary group puts a phrase in the sentence that Mundo should not drink outside the prose?That is quite an implicit point!\"And.\"Hyun Young looked straight at Baek Cheon.\"Then what's the matter?\"\"\u2026 Elder?\"\"What's wrong with drinking?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Is it Baek Cheon's misunderstanding that Hyun Young's face is getting hotter and hotter?It wasn't.Soon, Hyun Young, who dyed his face red, pointed his finger at Baek Cheon and pointed a finger at him.\"There are so many Bobborough guys who can't even earn their own money. The man who feeds you buys you drinks with his own money! You've become a private residence and you've been bragging about it, huh?\"What? Private or private residence?\"With the money he's made, he eats meat! He wants to drink with every penny he's saved! You can't stand it, so you come running and tell on me? You're not worth a meal, you're such a slut!\"Baek Cheon stammered with an absent-minded face.It was hard to understand the situation in which the three great disciples were criticized for telling them that they saw them drinking, but what was more difficult to understand was Hyun Young's reaction.Aren't you Hyun Young who is too calm and cold to be introduced to the North Sea Ice Palace because he came to Hawaii and he can't show his talent to the fullest?Seeing Hyun Young flip his eyes and point fingers, I can't tell whether this is a reality or a dream.\"Your temperament goes down to the chords like that, and the money...What do you do as a private residence when you earn a ball? I'm just pointing out that the sword and the rice and the stuff are good, the point! I'll break your head! Don't eat, you bastards! What did you do to eat meat...\u2026.\"Gulp!At that moment, someone violently kicked in the door.\"Hahaha, priest, here you are!\"Hyun Sang, who jumped in with a strange smile, hugs Hyun Young from behind and closes his mouth.\"Uh!Uh! Let go of me...\u2026.\"\"Hahaha, get out of here for a while. Wait, where the kids aren't. Oh, hold still!\"Whoops!Last time the door closed, the hall was filled with a curious silence. No one could easily open their mouth.Chop, chop, chop.All I could hear in that strange silence was Chung-Myung's slurping.\"What the...\"Baek Cheon muttered in spite of himself.\"What's going on?\"It was a word that represents the feelings of all his students.* * *\"Isn't that too strange? Capital punishment?\"Despite the questions directed at me, Baek Cheon simply put the teacup down in his hand without saying a word. An old teacup he's been using for a long time. I thought it had its own beauty until I went to the closure. But now that I look at it again, it looks more pathetic than elegant.This was the basic rule in Hawaii.Old household appliances and old buildings. And an old man.The only hope of the worn-out Moonpa was his students, and the biggest hope among them was Baek Cheon.However, the term \"brutal sea\" has changed to the point where the phrase \"brutal sea\" has become meaningless.\"It's strange that buildings are being rebuilt, and it's strange that places that have been left unattended for more than a decade are being repaired, no\u2026\u2026. I mean, that's all good. It's natural to do things that you haven't been able to do before if you have no money. But!\"Baek Sang said he couldn't stand his anger.\"Isn't the attitude of the grown-ups strange? I came back from a long closure, but the long-term writer didn't say much...\u2026.\"\"Didn't the long man praise you enough for your hard work?\"\"But it's been a year since I came\u2026\u2026.\"\"He's a man of great construction.\"Baek Sang lowered his head slightly. It was too much for a long writer to think for himself. But that doesn't make sense either.\"Let's just say the long man is, isn't it strange that Elder Hyun Young and the Ungum Sasuk are living together?\"Baek Cheon had no particular answer. It gets weird no matter what you say. If that's the case, it'll be seen as dissatisfied with the upper part, and there's too much to say otherwise.\"Didn't you feel it? My superiors are packing him up.\"\"Baek Sang.\"\"Yes, death penalty!\"\"I'm not too slow-witted.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Don't you understand that I was cursed in the face?\"Execution, isn't he a little cheeky?\"\"Hmm?\"\"Even if they're cheap, shouldn't we lower our heads first if the death penalty comes out like that? But he's...\u2026.\"Baek Sang was about to say something, but he shut up.If I had laughed at him, I would have openly cursed him, but it feels uncomfortable to swear at him as if he wasn't interested.\"Who.\"Baek Cheon's brow is narrowed.\"And I don't understand why a similar sibling is so interested in the child. Why would a simile...\u2026.\"There was a small stir in the teacup in Baek Sang's hand.\"Isn't it just the mind of a brother and sister?\"\"We have very little conversation. I've never seen a brother-in-law talk to anyone so aggressively. We haven't been together for a day or two, have we?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Let's just say, at least for the death penalty...\u2026.\"\"Baek Sang.\"\"\u2026\u2026yes, the death penalty.\"\"Don't raise your hackles too much.\"Baek Sang lowered his head again. Then I sneaked a peek at Baek Cheon's wit.I tried to manage my facial expression, but Baek Cheon's face was inevitably full of discomfort. I kept frowning.'I told the little one.'Isn't he even a priest or a man of substance?The difference in allocation in literary circles like Hawasan is literally heaven and earth. Just as he can't protest against Unja-bae no matter what, Chung-Myung should, of course.You're being cheeky.Baek Cheon bites his lips slightly.Then Baek Sang, who was cringing, sneaks in.\"It's because it's unfair. It's unfair. I'm back from that hard training, and the elders don't even recognize me, and isn't this chestnut-like creature stealing the cuteness of the grown-ups?\"\"It's past time for us to be cute.\"\"You know that's not what I mean.\"I know it. I know it so well.Baek Cheon sighed low.I mean, I feel like I'm subtly over the top.'Is it because I'm away for a long time?In the past, adults who would have visited Baek Cheon for Hwajong branch and training as soon as they returned are showing little interest in him.Instead, this person and that person look for Chung-Myung.Baek Cheon was unhappy about that.I don't know what Chung-Myung does to get the expectations of grown-ups who are so private, and even receive subtle protection, but Hawasan is his literary circle.It should be Baek Cheon who is expected by everyone in Hwasan, and it should also be him who will return to the brilliance of Moonpa afterwards.\"Are you going to leave him as he is?\"\"What if I don't?\"\"\u2026\u2026but shouldn't you still scold me? If you leave it at this rate, Hwasan will turn upside down. The death penalty has to come forward to set up a strict law.\"Baek Cheon smiled bitterly.I don't like how young people are playing, so I want you to beat them slim.\"For now, just calm down.\"\"The death penalty!\"Baek Sang raised his voice and Baek Cheon narrowed his forehead. Baek Sang, who saw the expression, slipped down his eyes.It is only when Baek Cheon sees the reaction that he nods with satisfaction.\"It's not that I don't feel like it either.\"\"But why...\"\"First of all, you need to know.\"\"Yes?\"Baek Cheon shook his head and slowly put the teacup down.\"There are pros and cons to work. Don't we need to know why the private servants are so protective of him?\"\"Oh, right. You have to.\"\"You're coming.\"\"Yes?\"As soon as Baek Cheon was done, someone knocked on the door.\"Come on in.\"Squeak.The person who came in with the sound of the door gave a ticket.\"My disciple, Yoon-jong, meets the private servants.\"\"Welcome.\"Baek Cheon points to the front.\"Sit down.\"\"Yes, private residence.\"Yoon-jong sat carefully in the chair. I say with my whole body, \"How dare I sit here?\" It was simply a polite attitude.Baek Cheon liked the attitude of Yoon-Jong.This is how it's meant to be.'I'm not acting like that cheeky bastard.Baek Cheon, who was slightly relieved, made a soft voice.\"Yoon-Jong\u110b\u1161.\"\"Yes, private residence.\"\"You've had a hard time serving your seniors as a high school student while I was away.\"\"As a disciple of Hawasan, I just did what I was supposed to do.\"\"Yes, you are. It's a matter of course to do it. But....\"Baek Cheon paused, and Yoon-jong sneaked up and looked at his complexion. And the words that followed were as expected as well.\"There's something going on in Hasan right now.\"\"\u2026\u2026Do you mean Chung-Myung?\"Baek Cheon did not reply Katabuta. But there's no way that Yoon-Jong can't guess what he means.\"It's my fault for not properly leading the priest as a death penalty. If you're angry, punish me, private.\"\"No, it's not your job to handle it. That's why I'm saying this.\"\"Yes, private residence.\"Baek Cheon has a subtle smile around his mouth.\"Tell yourself what the hell happened while I was away. I'll listen to it and decide on the future direction.\"Yoon-jong sighed deeply.It's so natural to explain it to your boss, but it feels like you're betraying Chung-Myung.'Before coming here, Yoon-jong had already asked Chung-Myung. Can I tell my boss what I've done so far? Chung-Myung's answer to that was very simple.- Go.\"\u2026\u2026.\"It would be better if you told me what to do.Yoon-Jong sneaked a look at Baek Cheon and made up his mind.\"First of all, I think I should tell you about Chung-Myung since he first came to Hawaii.\"As Yoon-jong slowly began to unravel the story, his disciples listened with bated breath.And as the story continued, Baek Cheon's face became more distorted little by little.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The harmony was full of vitality, and I often saw merchants I had never seen before.I've been away from Hasan for a long time, so I've vaguely thought that the harmony game has improved, but I don't think so.\"\u2026\u2026I see.\"Baek Cheon opened his mouth to say something and closed it again.\"I see.\"\"Yes, private residence, then I'll be going.\"\"Yes.\"Baek Cheon looked at Ho Gong with a serious look as Yoon-jong escaped from the room. Other priests were also absent-minded.\"No, what the...\u2026.\"Baek Sang opens his mouth as if he is despondent.\"Then does that mean that the little one has solved all of the troubles of Hasan by himself?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"There is consternation in the voice.Baek Cheon did not exactly contradict either.Hawasan's biggest problem was neither the Muhak nor the small number of Mundos. The reason why Hawasan fell so rapidly was because he had no money.It wasn't just that I didn't have any money.'The debt was enormous, too.Baek Cheon was most worried about what to do when he came back from Hawaii and went into closure.I can't believe Chung-Myung solved it.\"I can understand the grown-ups packing him.\"Baek Sang laughed despondently at Baek Cheon's talk to himself.\"I thought Elder Hyun Young was sponsoring a lot of money to Wasan because he was the child's child who eats meat with the money he earned. But now that I hear it, it's not...\u2026.\"He literally fed wasan.Baek Cheon shook his head.There's no answer to this.'If Baek Cheon was Hyun Young, he would have carried Chung-Myung on his back. He was a child who made money like water by failing to solve the financial problems of Hawasan, which had not shown any signs of resolution for decades, in just a few months.It is used in this case that it does not hurt even if you put it in your eyes.It's a good thing Hyun Young didn't have any children, and if Chung-Myung had a fight with him, he would have kicked him like a storm and blown him away.You can have another baby, but where do you get a guy like Chung-Myung?\"\u2026\u2026This is\u2026\u2026.\"\"Hmmm.\"Baek Cheon drooled heavily.\"If we had solved just one problem, it would have ended with 'made a contribution'. But he's entangled in the top of the galaxy. As long as the top of the galaxy manages Hwasan's finances and Hwasan earns it, Chung-Myung's position will increase every month.\"For the time being.\"\u2026\u2026can't one moment be a matter of course?\"\"He is. But will that moment come soon? As you know, this is now...\u2026.\"It's like gold has fallen from a beggar's den.It'll be nice to see and touch. Even if you don't have to take off the gold, wouldn't you be full just by having it?Chung-Myung is a man named Hwasan who threw gold into a beggar's den. No matter how Baek Cheon did, he couldn't have done such a thing.\"I can't believe the writer sees him separately.'Baek Cheon bit his lower lip slightly.I thought I would get the expectations of the grown-ups when I returned from the closure, but the guy who popped out of nowhere took all the expectations that Baek Cheon had to come.This is an issue that cannot be overlooked.\"Why do you say that's such a big ball?\"They say that they don't like Baekmun, who has only been listening to the conversation between the two so far.\"It's just a coincidence that we found Hawasan's talent, and wasn't it just lucky to treat Hwang Dae-in at the top of the galaxy?\"\"Priest.\"\"Hwasan is Mufa. It is impossible for Mufa to favor children who have earned money. How can you do that without Hawasan turning upside down?\"Baek Cheon alluded to a hundred questions.\"You'd better watch what you say. That's a word that criticizes the private and the private sector.\"\"\u2026\u2026I don't mean it like that.\"\"But that's not necessarily wrong.\"\"Yes?\"Baek Cheon nods calmly.\"The priest is right. Hwasan is Mufaja. No matter how much money you earn, as long as this place is not the top, but the bottom, Muhak is important.\"\"You're right.\"\"That's right.\"Baek Cheon nodded at the priests' answers.\"We have no choice but to get back to the basics. Now, the adults of the private sector have no choice but to pay attention to them, but once you realize that the Hwajong branch is approaching, you can't pay attention to the three great disciples.\"\"Yes, death penalty, yes, it will.\"\"So let's focus on Muhak for now. We can fix the habits of the celadon ships afterwards.\"Baek Sang sneakily looks at Baek Cheon.\"One, death penalty.\"\"What's wrong with you?\"\"We're not the only ones going to the Hwajong Branch, are we? The three great disciples will also participate in the Hwajong Branch.\"\"Is there anyone who doesn't know that?\"\"We're not the only ones who can do it. Shouldn't we stop the three great disciples from being humiliated as well?\"At that point, Baek Cheon looks at Baek Sang with interesting eyes.\"What is the priest's idea?\"\"If we think about ourselves, it would be right to focus on training, but the three great disciples are also Hwasan's disciples. How can you only think of our distribution? Even if it is a little burdensome, it will be a great help to Hwajong Branch if you can see the martial arts of the three great disciples for a short time.\"Baek Cheon grinned.\"As expected, the priest cares about Hawasan more than anyone else.\"\"I'm embarrassed, death penalty.\"\"Good idea. It wouldn't be a bad idea to sweat together since you've been away from your friends for a year.\"\"Yes, death penalty, that's a good way.\"Baek Cheon and Baek Sang laughed face to face.At the end of the day, dignity comes from strength. A gentle man commands respect, but respect is only respect.Family members need authority. If left as it is, it will not be long before the three great disciples will climb up.I need to let you know before that.Why they are adults. And why do I have to lower my head?\"I hope that Chung-Myung has a talent for martial arts. Wouldn't we, Hwasan, get a sign to lead future generations?\"\"It's the death penalty that will lead the future generations.\"\"I can't borrow the hands of priests forever. There will be a lot more things you can do if you are smart enough to listen.\"Baek Cheon put on a subtle smile.\" That can't eat pijuktto would you be so talented in there is a paws brutal, it looks like a child?\"He shrugged at the cold voice of a hundred gates.\"So why don't we teach and lead? It's gonna be a little too much for him.\"\"Well, I understand.\"Three people smiled happily at each other.I need to show you the dignity of my superiors.'Baek Cheon's eyes sink slowly.* * *\"Are you sleeping?\"\"Yes.\"\"Yes, I've been taken by the private servants because of me, and you're lying down comfortably.\"Yoon-jong's face was slightly flushed.'My dignity is\u2026\u2026.'Now I don't mean to ask Chung-Myung to be polite as the youngest. He threw away his treatments as ambassador in the evening.Nevertheless, I feel emotional today because I saw other white porcelain ships treating Baek Cheon.'That's the right kind of moon blue.'After seeing him show polite respect to his brother, I feel somewhat sad and teary.'I was treated like that once.'After that guy came, the other priests were touchy-feely. If only one person does that, I can understand, but everyone learns bad things quickly.\u2026.\"What do you think, death penalty?\"\"\u2026\u2026no.\"He's the problem, he's the problem!There used to be some respect in the midst of rebellion, but now you're acting like a male neighborhood!With a deep sigh, Yoon-jong looked at Jo-Gol.\"Walk.\"\"Yes?\"\"Is it really a good thing that Chung-Myung came to Hawaii?\"\"Don't say weird things, just talk. What happened?\"What a weird thing to say. That's not what you're gonna say to the ambassador?Oh, my God...\u2026.Yoon-jong, who eventually let go, glanced back at Chung-Myung lying on the bed and opened his mouth.\"He told me to tell him what I've done so far.\"\"Did you blow it as it was?\"\"\u2026\u2026what's the point of hiding it?\"\"Do it.\"It's something you'll find out anyway.\"What's your reaction?\"\"You're not asking because you don't know, are you?\"\"\u2026\u2026Yeah.\"Yoon-jong and Jo-Gol sighed deeply. Seeing Chung-Myung lying on the bed tapping on his stomach makes me sigh.\"Crazy.\"He's a piece of shit.No matter how hard it is. Baek Cheon is not a death penalty, but a private residence. Where do you think there's a case where you mess up on your first meeting with a private residence?Baek Cheon wasn't so hard on his three great disciples. However, as long as the relationship has gone awry, we don't know how it will turn out.\"I don't think he's gonna make it.\"\"\u2026\u2026I would do the same.\"There's no one in the world who would like Chung-Myung when he first saw her. Didn't Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong try to beat Chung-Myung at least once?Fortunately, they could end up at a moderate level, but if Baek Cheon decides to trample on Chung-Myung, the situation could be bigger than expected.\"The blind arrow will fall on us for no reason.\"\"You're right.\"Yoon-jong, who let out a sigh once again, looks at Jo-Gol with determined eyes.\"By the way, didn't you ever guess when you heard that the private servants were coming back?\"\"That's right.\"\"Call the kids and tell them to be careful of their behavior from tomorrow. Even if there is nothing special, I will never let this go because this has happened.\"\"Yes, sir.\"After answering, Jo-Gol, who was trying to turn around and leave, suddenly stopped. Then I sneaked back at Yoon-Jong.\"But the death penalty.\"\"Huh?\"\"I'm just curious\u2026\u2026.\"\"What?\"\"Who will win if Baek Cheon is against Chung-Myung?\"\"\"\u2026\u2026Don't be ridiculous and do what you're told to do.\"\"Chat.\"Jo-Gol pouted out to the face of Yoon-Jong.Left in Chung-Myung's room, Yoon-jong glanced at the owner of the room who was still wandering in his dreams.Who's going to win?'You don't know that?\"\u2026\u2026sleep well. You're a troublemaker.Now the peace in Hawasan is over. There will be a commotion ahead.Looking down at Chung-Myung's face, who was asleep, smiled and left the room.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bringing the car also meant there was a lot to talk about today.\"How was it?\"To his question, Unam glanced before Unam answered. I mean, is it okay for anyone to listen? Then Hyun Jong picked up the car and said briefly.\"It's all right.\"\"Yes, of course.\"The sword opens its mouth.\"I didn't intervene as you said. And then... ...\"\"Then what?\"\"We're having some problems.\"\"Hmm.\"Hyun Jong nodded still.\"If Hyun Young hadn't come, the atmosphere would have been more urgent. As Jang Moon-in said, there is a subtle atmosphere between the two disciples and the three great disciples.\"\"I guess so.\"Hyun Jong sighed.This is happening because of their choice.I was in a hurry.'The distance between the Unja and the White Porcelain boats is too far, and the distance between the White Porcelain and the Celadon is too close. Therefore, the age of Yoo-Esul, the youngest of the white porcelain belly, is almost no different from Yoon-jong, the oldest in the celadon belly.Given that it is customary to make some difference by blocking the entrance for a while, it should be said that the problem of bursting has erupted.It was an inevitable problem.'At the time of receiving the three great disciples, Hawasan could not afford a new disciple. At the same time, Munpa's finances were getting worse and worse. It was a situation that deserved to be blocked from entering.Then someone brought up the idea of getting support from their family instead of continuing to receive disciples. That was the beginning of the problem.For Hawasan, who had to somehow attach a crumbled straw to his side, wouldn't he have to come up with the money right away?Even if he died, he was a prestigious man, who chose his disciples. However, at that time, the family members who supported him were accepted as disciples without questioning or questioning.Thanks to this, celadon pears were considered somewhat slow in terms of the talent of martial arts.\"In the old days, the children of celadon boats would not dare to do anything about white porcelain. But isn't the celadon belly different now?\"\"That's right.\"Is there a centripetal point? Doesn't it exist?What is meaningless in individual lives is that there is a huge difference in work between groups.Based on the ambiguous centripetal points of Yoon-jong and Jo-Gol, the celadon ships were merely Hawasan's three great disciples. However, the celadon belly, which is centered around Chung-Myung, will not be satisfied with just that.Those who are 20 years apart do not regard each other as competitors, but those who are 10 years apart have no choice but to be aware of each other.\"It's my fault.\"Hyun Jong shook his head firmly as the Ungum lowered his head.\"It's not your fault.\"\"Long-lived...\"\"I was the one who insisted on building a white pipe. And that was everyone's opinion, wasn't it? In the first place, this was predicted from the time when the three great disciples were established and received.\"This was not just meant to comfort the fortune-teller.By creating a white pipe, Hwasan benefited a lot. But if you gain something, you lose something.If it was a way of transferring to a priestly relationship as before, no matter how young the age difference is, you cannot dare treat the upper distribution carelessly.However, the three great disciples now received nothing from the white porcelain. Learning is learned from a fortune-teller, and training with colleagues. Naturally, it is bound to be far from the upper distribution.This was the biggest weakness of the White House.Unam peeked at him and opened his mouth.\"What would you do if I did?\"Hyun Jong savored plum tea without saying katabuta. I feel a little calm because I smell the subtle plum blossoms.\"What can you do?\"\"One thing at a time...\u2026.\"\"That's the way people are. Will our hearts be crushed and forced to lead them? Sometimes it's not bad to just let it collide. Isn't that how things end up?\"\"It's the work of a long man, his disciples.\"\"If you decide to do it, you can turn the river around. However, if you force the water to turn on, you will have problems even if it is plausible at first.\"Hyun Jong said with a big smile.\"Lucky sword.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"Let's trust our children.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Ungum looked at Hyunjong with a really complicated face. It seems clear that there are still doubts left.At that time, Hyun Jong brought up a slightly different direction from Ungum's idea.\"Baek Cheon is not too much of a child.\"\"Yes?\"\"Don't you think so?\"The countenance of the sword went blank.'No, it's not a long story.'Baek Cheon is not the problem. The problem is that Chung-Myung guy!It was only then that Ungum realized that there was a huge gap between Chung-Myung that elders looked at and Chung-Myung that he looked at.Ungum, the owner of the white plum house, knows Chung-Myung's capture of the three great disciples, but Hyun-jong sees Chung-Myung as just a pretty puppy who asks for blessings to Hawasan.\"Isn't Baek Cheon still a child with a clear mind? Even if he loses his pride and gets angry for a while, he will not hurt the righteousness of his long-term relationship. You don't have to worry too much because I'll sew it properly.\"Pardon?Who's gonna suture who?Baek Cheon wants Chung-Myung?It's a mess.'No wonder the long writer was so carefree!But it's impossible to explain from now on. No matter how many times I tell you, you won't believe me.And in fact, Ungum is also at a loss how to explain Chung-Myung. The sense of incompatibility he felt when he looked at Chung-Myung was just a vague sense. Isn't it ambiguous how to convince them if they're about to explain it?\"\u2026\u2026Yes. I see, Jang Moon-in.\"Eventually, the fortune-teller had no choice but to step down.\"Lucky sword.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"The Hwajong branch is just around the corner.\"As soon as the word Hwajong Branch came out, the face of the Ungold sword became dark.As a matter of fact, Hawasan's disciples now do not have the same bad blood against Jongnam as they did in the past. In the first place, Hawasan's feelings towards Jongnam stemmed from competition.But isn't competition inherently between people who don't have similar or big differences? Now that the difference between Hwasan and Jongnam is as different as heaven and earth, there are no people who truly burn their competition to Jongnam.But who would want to see Jafar's disciples being held captive by other students, no matter how uncompetitive they are?The difference is only that much difference because they are children, and the difference will be doubled at the level of disciples and elders who are fully ripe with martial arts.\"I've solved a lot of problems. But you didn't solve the most important problem. We are only at the beginning. You have to do a lot to recreate the glory of the brilliant Hawasan.\"\"I'll keep that in mind. \"The Long Writers.\"\"Yes, both of you go out.\"\"Yes.\"\"Yes.\"When Ungum and Unam said hello and stepped down, Hyun Jong quietly shook off his seat and stood up.When I open the window behind the room, I can now see Yeonhwabong, which has almost melted snow.Small buds were formed on the fully grown plum tree. Spring plum blossoms will probably bloom all over the mountain by the time the Hwajong Branch begins.Plum Blossom... Plum Blossom.The sword has been recovered.However, Hyun Jong knew very well that it was impossible to recreate the glory of the past with only a sword.If only there was plum blossom testing.'Hyunjong closes his eyes tightly.But he also knows that it doesn't make a difference if he sees nothing. Now is not the time to search for what is not there, but to strengthen what is there.Nevertheless, the regret does not disappear from the corner of the heart.\"Good men. Bowing down to Hawasan.\"It was Hyun Jong, who couldn't have known that the good man was already in Wasan.* * *Unfortunately, Hyun Jong made two mistakes.One of them, of course, is to give Chung-Myung too much credit.But this didn't really matter from Hawasan's point of view. Chung-Myung's ultimate goal is to raise Hawasan anyway. The more Hyun-Jeong thinks of Chung-Myung, the wider his radius of activities will be.It was not intended, but thanks to Hyun-jong's favorable view of Chung-Myung, Hwasan is developing faster.But the other mistake was more fatal than I thought...\u2026.That's because Baek Cheon is not as gentle as Hyun Jong thinks.\"Anything...\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"You're gonna have to eat.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The three great disciples of Hawasan huddled together at the White House with bewitching faces.Chung-Myung's training squeezes everything out of a person. I don't know how the hell you know, but this ghostly man accurately checks the remaining strength of his three great disciples and squeezes out the last drop of water.Therefore, after the training, everyone had no choice but to become stiff like a piece of sun-dried cloth.Surprisingly, however, the three great disciples did not express any dissatisfaction with the hard training that continued day after day.Of course, I feel like I'm out of breath every time I train, but aren't humans adaptable animals?The terrible training was repeated for a week or so over a day or two, and somehow it became worth holding on. Now, he has developed to the point where he greets the grim reaper and returns.- Iron becomes stronger as it beats, and man becomes stronger as he rolls! There is no moss in a rolling man.People don't usually get moss. You crazy thing.'Even worse, the three great disciples were proving Chung-Myung's words with their whole body. I can feel that they are different from day to day by day.We are now understanding what the word \"a way suitable for the body\" means.onlyThe problem was that a new bolt of lightning fell on the three great disciples who believed that everything would be fine if they overcame Chung-Myung's training.\"I feel like I'm going to die.\"\"Mr... .. unless it's a real private residence.\"\"That's too much, isn't it?\"White porcelain that now afflicts them. So they were his students.That dayAfter Chung-Myung confronted Baek Cheon, these disciples began to manipulate the three great disciples. It is clear that finding all kinds of faults in every case is intentionally.\"\ub300\uccb4 \uc800 \uc778\uac04\ub4e4 \uc65c \uc800\ub7ec\ub294 \uac70\ub0d0?\"\"\ubab0\ub77c\uc11c \ubb3b\ub0d0?\"\"\ub044\uc73c\uc73c\uc751.\"\ubaa8\ub450\uc758 \uc2dc\uc120\uc774 \uc77c\uc81c\ud788 \ud55c\uacf3\uc73c\ub85c \ub3cc\uc544\uac14\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc2dc\uc120 \ub05d\uc5d0 \ub193\uc778 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774\uc57c \ubed4\ud588\ub2e4.\"\uc751?\"\uc0ac\ud615\uc81c\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2dc\uc120\uc744 \ubc1b\uc740 Chung-Myung\uc774 \uace0\uac1c\ub97c \uac38\uc6c3\uac70\ub838\ub2e4.\"\uc544\ub2c8, \uc65c \ub0a0 \ubd10?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\uc774 \uc0c8\ub07c\ub294 \uc591\uc2ec\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac8c \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uac8c \ubd84\uba85\ud558\ub2e4.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's so cheap and dirty.\"These disciples really bothered them in all sorts of ways.Every time he trains, he not only points out every little thing, but also makes all kinds of nitpicks in his daily life.Today, there was even an order to clean the white plum without a grain of dust because the exterior of the white plum is dirty.\"Why don't you beat me up?\"Jo-Gol grated his teeth.I'm used to bullying with my fist, but I just couldn't get used to this kind of bullying.\"I never imagined that private houses were like that.\"\"I respected you!\"\"This isn't some kind of neighborhood wacko, is it's okay?\"Yoon-jong sighed deeply.There's nothing that can't be done.'There is no doubt that his students do this to harass them. Because the malice and ridicule at the end of the sentence are so vivid.But that doesn't mean their actions are wrong. In the first place, all the students ask for is what is set by Hawasan's norms.But why is that a problem?'The rules were set at least two hundred years ago.'Essentially old norms are modified by the changing times.But Hawasan's norms did not.So far, we have chosen to ignore out-of-date norms under tacit agreement as a way to overcome that gap.However, his students came up with this standard and began to crack down on the three great disciples.Aside from everything, the biggest problem was that all of these gorilla norms were earrings when they were hung on the ears and nose earrings when they were hung on the nose.\"No, Hawasan's disciples should not let go of the sword from their hands, how does that mean that they should hold it in their hands when they wash up or do their business!\"\"\u2026\u2026I was told to hold it in my hand when I eat.\"\"You're growing up in your sleep!\"\"If that's all, I won't tell you. How does it mean that the disciples of Hwasan always have to keep the teachings of the good in mind to memorize all of his history!\"\"\u2026\u2026they don't even know.\"\"That's what I'm saying!\"The three great disciples gnashed their teeth.All of you were getting distracted in front of this strange absurdity. Every time the students of Ewha Womans University sneaked up and glanced over, it felt like their lifespan was decreasing.\"I can't even eat properly! I can't sleep well!\"\"If you're bored, it's a gathering. I think they're cursing at me because one person called me out for my fault.\"\"What the hell is going on in Daemyung!\"\"Don't we have to do something about it?\"Yoon-jong sighed deeply.\"What do you want me to do?\"\"It's a little too much! Honestly, it's obvious that you're going to bully him, but it's fair to let him win.\"\"Yes! I can put up with anything else. But I can't stand it any more than disturbing my training! Even so, we're in Mufa, so we shouldn't disturb the training!\"The three great disciples had blood in their eyes.In fact, there has been nothing much to confront between the three great disciples and the great disciples. The disciples of this school were busy training, and since teaching the three great disciples is the role of a white plum house, they have been living together like cows.Still, it is true that the three great disciples felt something similar to their admiration. However, the betrayal is indescribable because they appear so petty.Yoon-jong turned his head and looked at the root of all this.Yoon-jong, who was reading Chung-Myung's countenance leaning on the chair, carefully opens his mouth.\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161.\"\"Huh?\"\"\u2026\u2026shouldn't you do something about it?\"\"What?\"\"The private servants, the private servants.\"Yoon-jong sighed deeply.No one knows why this is happening, just because they don't speak out.Now, these disciples want the three great disciples, especially Chung-Myung, to bow down to them.'It's a very silly way of doing it.'Yoon-jong understood their position in his own way.In fact, it's not the white porcelain belly that's wrong, it's the Chung-Myung that's wrong. To be precise, there is a problem not with Chung-Myung's actions, but with its very existence itself.Even if Yoon-jong is a white porcelain boat, it would be difficult to tolerate having a maggot like Chung-Myung in the below distribution.So far, there has been little problem with relationships with great disciples and elders. Because Chung-Myung never crosses the line when dealing with them. Regardless of what's inside, it's clear that you respect him as an adult of the private sector.But it's different for a white porcelain ship.Didn't Yoon-jong already see Chung-Myung treat the white porcelain belly?\"\u2026\u2026isn't it obvious what they want?\"\"It's obvious?\"Yoon-jong sighed once again.\"I won't tell you to learn your personality or bend it. If you just please me a little bit, I'll figure it out somehow...\u2026.\"\"Bewildered?\"Yoon-jong's eyes slightly trembled at Chung-Myung's voice.Oops, I chose the wrong word...\u2026.However, contrary to Yoon-jong's expectations, Chung-Myung did not have a seizure. Rather, he just looked at Yoon-jong with sparkling eyes and said cheerfully.\"Death penalty, death penalty!\"\"Huh?\"\"I think I know a better solution than that! This is really gonna fix everything!\"Chung-Myung's face, which smiles brightly with excitement, makes me nervous even before hearing it, but there was no way not to ask as an ambassador.\"\u2026\u2026what's the way?\"\"What do you mean, what? We're going to destroy all those bastards!\"As soon as Chung-Myung finished talking, he stormed out of his seat and stood up. Surprised, Yoon-jong exclaimed in a panic.\"Hold it, hold it! If we don't catch him, we're all dead! Get him! Get him!Perhaps he felt anxious like Yoon-jong, but all the capital punishments he was preparing for flew in unison. Jo-Gol jumped up and crushed Chung-Myung's body to the floor while they held Chung-Myung's arms and legs.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"\"Don't let go! Never let go!\"\"Let go of me! Let go of me!\"The three great disciples, who clung to each other like dogs, desperately grabbed Chung-Myung and stretched. Their desperate eyes showed the will of the association to \"never let this crazy dog loose outside the White Pavilion.\"\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161! Calm down, Chung-Myung!\"\"We're all going to be destroyed!\"\"There's a mutiny! You're going to be excommunicated if you beat a private house!\"Chung-Myung's eyes glistened.\"Okay, I won't punch you! I'm not going to punch you! I'll just punch you! I only hit once!\"\"That's how you beat me, you nut job! Hold it right there!\"\"No, he's so powerful!\"\"Huh!\"Chung-Myung wriggled his teeth.\"Those bastards are doing things they didn't do a hundred years ago! My va*in* is sticking out!\"Doga is basically a place of naturalism. In other words, Doga is not bound by the norms and classes created by society.Isn't it so famous that when Confucius came to greet Lao-ja in the past, Lao-ja told him not to do such a thing?However, the disciples of Doga were doing old-fashioned things that would not be done even in oil prices.\"Calm down, Chung-Myung! You'll be in big trouble if you beat up the private servants.\"\"All the balls we've got so far could be blown away!\"\"Stay put! Stay put! Don't move!\"\"Let me go! Let me go! Don't you dare!\"The three great disciples built a huge wooden tower and pushed Chung-Myung down. But every time Chung-Myung wriggled, the giant tower reeled.Yoon-jong sweated as he watched the scene.'No, does this make sense?'Baek Cheon is the strongest of his students.Before Chung-Myung's arrival, the position of the first journalist of Hwasan was naturally Baek Cheon, and everyone had no doubt that he would one day become the first master of Hwasan.Jo-Gol is also talented, but in the end it takes time to accumulate. It was almost impossible for Jo-Gol to catch up with Baek Cheon, who had already mastered the sword a decade earlier than Jo-Gol.Even if it's possible, it'll be decades later.That's what allocation is about. No matter how talented you are, the time accumulated is different, and the learning of martial arts are different. Therefore, it was the difference in distribution that could not be easily overcome.But what is the situation in front of Yoon-jong?The youngest of the celadon ship, the last to enter Hwasan, is harping on empty words to beat up the white porcelain ship's metabolism.The real problem is no one here thinks it's impossible.'What if I'm being rational?I don't understand.No matter how strong Chung-Myung is, I don't think it's going to be a match against Baek Cheon. Even if Chung-Myung had mastered martial arts even before he took his baby steps, Baek Cheon would have held the sword for more than that.Moreover, Baek Cheon is not a man lacking talent.It is impossible to surpass the difference of time with most differences in talent. The person who can do that is called a genius, but no matter how great a genius is, it takes time to go beyond a decade.Rationally, really rationally, it's absolutely impossible for Chung-Myung to beat Baek Cheon.But the problem is that I feel like Baek Cheon will get beaten up if I do.'In the first place, common sense and reason don't work for this person in front of you. What common sense has he done so far?\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161.\"Yoon-jong sighed deeply and said.\"I know how you feel, but not now.\"\"Why?\"\"Hwajong branch is just around the corner.\"\"Why?\"\"\u2026\u2026Baek Cheon's death penalty is the person who should be the representative of this disciple at the Hwajong Branch. What would you do if such a person was hit by you and couldn't participate in the Hwajong branch?\"\"Come on. Don't tell me I'm going to beat you like that. It hurts, but it's my specialty not to hurt. Don't you know?\"\"I know.\"I know very well. I've been hit countless times.\"But you can't. Baek Cheon, get beaten up by the grumpy. You don't think you're confident?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Let's be patient. It's better for us to get killed by Baek Cheon than to be ignored by the Jong Nam.\"Chung-Myung frowns on his face.\"I think it's better to just blow it up.\"\"For once in my face, let it slide. Hwajong Branch is such a big deal. Please.\"\"Hmmm.\"Chung-Myung turned his head. And said in a slightly dull voice.\"Get out of the way now.\"The death penalty is wary of Yoon-jong. When Yoon-jong nodded, he slowly left Chung-Myung and slowly stepped aside. At the same time, Chung-Myung kept his distance so that he could catch it again at any time.\"Then I just have to wait until the Hwajong branch is over, right?\"\"\u2026\u2026I don't mean I have to put up with it until then\u2026\u2026.\"\"What's so blurry? Definitely!\"Yoon-jong closed his eyes tightly. And I spoke with a feeling of putting out the urgent fire first.\"Yes, it's only Hwajong Branch!\"\"Okay.\"Chung-Myung nods coolly.\"But he's been through a lot of trouble, and I have to listen to him.\"\"\u2026\u2026thank you very much.\"\"Why are you crying?\"\"No. No.\"This is not tears. Sweat in the heart, you son of a b*tc*.\"But what if we get into a fight over there?\"\"\u2026\u2026isn't that possible?\"\"Just in case.\"Yoon-jong sighed.\"Then you take care of it. Because I don't know anymore.\"\"Really?\"Chung-Myung rolls up the corners of his mouth.

I'm not even saying anything that could be a problem.\"\"Hmm, really?\"Baek Cheon narrowed the middle of his forehead.'This is a little different from what I expected.'Aren't you in the middle of your life? I thought I'd get angry right away if you scratched me a little bit. And that was Baek Cheon's final target.Hawasan is a prestigious political party.There are only two things that are considered the most sinful in the prestigious faction. One is Mado, the other is mutiny.These two things are not acceptable under any circumstances. The former is related to the identity of Hawasan, who claims to be the right person, and the latter is a reversal of Hawasan's and systems.I was going to scratch the three great disciples lightly and then twist them together in moderation so that they wouldn't even dare to rebel again.Surprisingly, the three great disciples are putting up with the pressure of their great disciples.\"Isn't the pressure weak?\"\"This is too much. If we do more, we may have problems in the process of determining the dispute.\"\"Hmmm.\"Baek Cheon drooled low as if he didn't like it.\"You're not a thoughtless hothead, are you?'Considering Chung-Myung from the restaurant, I think he would have already jumped in, but he is not only self-conscious but also cracking down on other three great disciples...\u2026.Or is it what Yoon-jong does?'Either way, it is certain that the reason is not being solved as Baek Cheon thinks.\"What about the other three great disciples?\"\"Other than having a strange training at first glance\u2026\u2026.\"Baek Cheon tapped his cheek with his finger still.\"You're right.\"\"Death penalty, it's too much to hold on. We don't know when the private houses will show signs of displeasure, and the Hwajong branch is just around the corner. We need to prepare for Hwajong branch.\"\"I know.\"Baek Cheon nodded lightly.\"Now that we've cooked enough, it's time to scoop up the porridge.\"\"What if you do?\"Back Sang's question caused Baek Cheon to start with a smirk.\"As you know, celadon boats are originally all good kids.\"\"That's right. Before we left the building, they were all innocent children. I didn't expect to change like that in just a year.\u2026.\"\"Because it's all tied up with a bad guy. In fact, do we need to punish all the children in the celadon belly? The only problem is Chung-Myung.\"\"You're right.\"Baek Sang couldn't agree more with Baek Cheon.The three great disciples and their representative Yoon-Jong are not difficult children to deal with. Although Jo-Gol was a little outstanding among them, Jo-Gol was a child who could be solved well within Baek Sang's line without Baek Cheon's having to step up.The problem is the Chung-Myung.Don't call it the Black of the Dead.The three great disciples who were fine hung out with Chung-Myung, and everyone became strange.At least the three great disciples they had seen knew how to respect their superiors, and they knew that the words of private servants were more important than those of their motives.It was none other than Chung-Myung who made the three great disciples feel bad.In other words, if Chung-Myung could be broken, the other three disciples would naturally be as obedient as in the past.\"What would you do if I don't know.\"\"Priest.\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"Baek Cheon grinned.\"Do you need any other way? Isn't what we're doing now just sticking to the laws of Hasan?\"\"Of course, death penalty.\"\"There's no room for personal feelings. Isn't Chung-Myung also my precious trait? It's a little cheeky, but it would be a good resource if you comforted it. So I'm just trying to make things right when I was a kid.\"Baek Cheon put on a subtle smile.\"However, the problem is that I don't want to use rough methods if I can, but I can't help it because I don't have enough time. The best way to discipline a child is to talk, but sometimes to sell.\"Baek Sang nodded willingly.\"One day they'll know the deep meaning of the death penalty.\"\"I will, even if it hurts a little now.\"The two smiled at each other.* * *Squeak.The door to the white plum opens slightly.Peeking.And soon a little head comes out. Those who look around with their heads slightly raised frown slightly.You don't have it, do you?Like a night guest seeping through the darkness, Chung-Myung looked around closely with a sense of humor.There's no getting caught, no human.Chung-Myung sighed low and came out.\"Yes.\"What are you doing?Walking trudging out of the white plum, he looked up at the sky with his soul escaping.\"Long death penalty. Are you watching?\"Long death was the most cherished thing in the world...\u2026.- What?Oh, don't get annoyed from here. Just finish listening and get angry! That man must be patient! You're a man of great literary background music.Chung-Myung distorted his face.\"Anyways, I'm doing this to avoid a child who hasn't lost blood in his hair. Does this make any sense?\"I spoke with a great deal of resentment, but unfortunately, Cheon Mun's answer was not heard.\"That's all, where? A young woman stir-fries a person, and a parasitic orabi-like person brings a standard that I've never heard before. Oh, I'd rather die than suffer!\"I really want to turn everything upside down if I have a temper. I feel like I want to take a long writer to see what you did when the young people are making this fuss.When Chung-Myung led Hawasan to the world, it almost gives up to see things that were not even born in private residence and condescending.If it is now, he will accept it as a disciple, saying that even if he runs straight to Shaolin, a noble man who realized the illegality has come. Really\"Ha! What sin did I commit in my past life...\"I've committed a lot of sins.\"To be honest, I can't do this because I feel guilty. I can't say it's hard to say anything empty now, considering how long the long-lived or long-lived writers have been upset about what he did when he was a great disciple and a great disciple of Hwasan.\"Why did I do that?\"Chung-Myung's eyes were filled with moisture.I should've done enough.It feels like all the karma in the past life is coming back. I feel like I'm leading young people who aren't human.Oh, that's why Jang Moon-sa didn't get married in his previous life. I'm afraid you'll have a child like me.I'm sorry. Long death.I thought I couldn't get married because I couldn't face the death penalty.\u2026.With a deep sigh, Chung-Myung trudged out of the prose. Had it been Hwasan in the past, there would have been a guard at this time, but now Hwasan was not doing much at the time when there were no visitors.The reason is simple.Not long ago, Hawasan was a place to toss coins with beggars and turn around, so there was no reason to need a stomachache.Chung-Myung is the one who made such a place where people can live.And you ungrateful bastards! I'm not grateful for the old man's hard work to make a living.I'd love to beat him up, but...\u2026.\"Yeah, I can't do this either.\"It's strange, but these days, Yoon-jong's face keeps overlapping with that of a long death sentence. It would be very rude for Yoon-jong to compare his face to that of a bandit-like Jangmun-sa-hyung, but his expression is becoming similar, not his face.Whenever Chung-Myung does something, he looks like he's rotting inside.\u2026.'I feel strangely guilty.'It's hard to ignore it because it seems like Jang Moon-sa is back alive and struggling.\"Sad.\"Chung-Myung shook his head again.\"I will endure it until the end of Hwajong Branch or whatever.\"I want to turn Jong-nam upside down because Chung-Myung is the same. No matter how much I don't like those white porcelain men, I can't compare them to Jongnam.They want to kick their asses, but Jongnam wants to strangle them.As Yoon-jong said, it is right to endure it until the Hwajong branch passes.That's right....\"Yes, I'll get in trouble because I can't get over my temper.\"It is best not to run into white porcelain boats until the Hwajong branch is over.Chung-Myung began to climb the mountain differently than usual.I'm never going to Yeonhwabong anymore.A person can be beaten twice, but not three times. If you get the same thing three times, who's that person?Chung-Myung turned his head and looked at Nakanbong.\"Oh, my God. Now I can't even train myself.\"Die rather than suffer. Die rather than suffer.Even at this moment, other civil servants who have trained for nearly a hundred years will be constantly strengthening.Chung-Myung doesn't have time to rest to narrow the gap. There's no point in being strong among the same distributions.In order for Hwasan to stand tall again in the old file room...\u2026 No, beyond that, in order to reproduce past films and further make a name for themselves as the world's best inspection, the presence of a master to subdue the old monsters is essential.And no matter how many times I wash my eyes and look for it, Chung-Myung is the only one who can play that role in Hwasan.Well, you never know.About 50 years? 100 years?If you aim for the world's best inspection after that, you may be able to raise Jo-Gol or Yoon-Jong. Although cheap, Baek Cheon is also a talent, so it seems like a possibility if you manage the wrong basics.But the problem was that Chung-Myung wasn't good enough to wait leisurely for the period.\"Frozen to death for 50 years.\"Before that, I'm going to explode.Chung-Myung, who climbed the Nakan Peak, slowly pulled out the sword. Then he glances around.You don't have it, do you?Whether it was the accident or the accident, Chung-Myung has been following him like a leech since that day.He seemed to refrain from moving with other celadon boats, but if Chung-Myung felt like he fell alone, he bothered people to come and talk for a while.Strangely, Yoo-Esul's presence was not easy to capture even with the sense of Chung-Myung in the world, although it would be enough to avoid it in advance if he could feel any signs.It's not a ghost.Sometimes it's not that no one has a vague presence due to weak feelings, but Yoo-Esul has a surprisingly vague feeling even to Chung-Myung.Moreover, Chung-Myung, who is used to feeling people through chi, not eyes or ears, is especially...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung.\"\"Argh! Argh!\"I know. Like this.Chung-Myung, who almost jumped up from his seat, freaked out and stepped back. You can see Yoo-Esul reaching for him vaguely in his eyes.\"No! Come on! Look at me and show up!\"Yoo-Esul furrowed as Chung-Myung screamed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You're my temper.\"\"So what?\"\"Polite to the accident.\"'The accident is freezing to death. It's like a ghost.\"Chung-Myung sighed with irritation.Let's just say there's no sign, it doesn't mean it's strange that there's a unique constitution like that in this vast world of midfield.Actually, Chung-Myung is specialized in feeling people with a sense of humor. If you use your five senses, it's not to the point that you can't feel their popularity.There is a real problem.\"No, why are you following me?\"\"Have you been?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung felt a very deep sadness.'When the death penalty looks at me now, they're crying...\u2026 No, I'll be out of breath laughing at my belly.'I might clap until I break my hand. They're not gonna make it.When I tried to give honorifics to a young descendant who is not even as old as a granddaughter, my life's free comes to me. He is about to be struck directly by the futility of the world and become a fable with enlightenment.Aside from the question of whether Chung-Myung is accepted by the shipbuilding industry.He's not picking up, man.Oh, come on!Chung-Myung sighed and looked at Yoo-Esul.\"And why! Why do you keep following me?\"\"Have you been?\"\"...go around.\"Yoo-Esul raised his eyebrows as if he didn't like it.I think he's trying to scare me by making a slightly angry face, but he's cute watching.I don't think I'm cute because I'm old.'As Jo-Gol and the other three great disciples all agreed, it is certainly pretty. If he had a colorful expression and a soft impression, he would have attracted more people's attention than now.It's a leather shell, though.But how a man dwells on his skin. Didn't Chung-Myung benefit greatly from his beautiful appearance in the past?\u2026.Oh, all right! I know!\"The sword.\"Yoo-Esul looked at Chung-Myung and said.\"The sword that smokes plum blossoms.\"\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"Chung-Myung pretended to be.There is nothing that cannot be explained to explain, but there is no reason why it should be. I hate being bothered, so it's best to just take it off.\"I don't know what I saw wrong, but I don't know that, so don't waste your breath\u2026\u2026.\"\"Teach me.\"\"Let's go...\" Huh?Chung-Myung opened his eyes slightly wide.\"What?\"\"Teach me.\"Chung-Myung narrows the middle of the forehead.Was that why you followed me around?'I thought he would bother people by saying, \"Where did you learn martial arts, not Hwasan's?\" or \"I learned martial arts,\" but I didn't expect such words to come out.Then I became curious.\"I know what it is...\u2026. No, I don't know that.\"Yoo-Esul bites his lips slightly.\"I'm going to tell the private sector.\"\"Say it. If you believe me.\"\"I'm going to tell the long story.\"\"Yes, yes. Suit yourself. At your disposal.\"Chung-Myung sniffles and shakes his hands.Tell them to believe what they believe.'Less than half a year after entering Hawasan, a blue man shook off his sword and smoked plum blossoms full of lotus sticks.a person with a long handHuh. I guess Lee Seol had a hard time practicing for closing tubes. I can see everything in vain. I'll find my good congressman.'It would be a good thing if you didn't tie it up and throw it at your will.\"I won't tell you, so teach me.\"\"Tell me. I don't care.\"Chung-Myung grinned.\"So don't get in the way of other people's training. You can't train every time because of accidents.\"Go, all right?Go away, you little leech!Chung-Myung tried to retort more, but Yoo-Esul stared at Chung-Myung and opened his mouth.\"You don't want me to teach you?\"\"Excuse me, accident.\"\"Huh?\"\"You're the accident and I'm the one, what do I teach the accident? If I learn, I'll learn.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yoo-Esul flinched.Oh, this works.'Yoo-Esul, who emphasized that he was an accident when we first met. So this word will work...\u2026.\"There's nothing up and down about learning.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Where the hell did you learn to think of oil prices? Has the white porcelain boat been turned into Confucianism as a group? Confucianism in some sacred conduit! If Taesangno knows, he'll ignore the bubble!\"So teach me.\"\"No, there's nothing I can teach you. You're right!\"Chung-Myung put it bluntly.\"I don't know what the accident saw, but it's just a dream. Or fantasy. Otherwise, I'd have seen the hard work in vain. I don't understand what the accident means? So stop it now and go away.\"When Chung-Myung cut his hair firmly, Yoo-Esul opened his eyes slim.\"There's no way I could've been wrong.\"\"No, it's just a waste of...\u2026.\"\"I've seen it before.\"\"Before\u2026\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung's eyes were wide open.\"What?\"Chung-Myung's momentum has changed. And glaring at Yoo-Esul with sharp eyes.A sword that smokes plum blossoms.Plum Blossom Screening.There are a number of swords modeled after plum blossoms in Hawasan.However, it does not simply mimic the shape of plum blossoms, but there are only a few swords that can produce plum blossoms.Except for one of them, it is not passed on to ordinary disciples. At least an elder can learn. It is also passed down only by conviction, not by rank.On that day, all of Hawasan's elders died at the top of 100,000 mountains. Nobody thought of annihilation, so they didn't even leave a verdict.That means.If someone smoked plum blossoms with a sword, it would mean that they eventually learned the art of plum blossoms.And where the sword is now passed on...\u2026.\"What's your relationship with the pro-Nam faction?\"Chung-Myung growls slightly and Yoo-Esul tilts his head.\"Jongnam?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Why Jong-nam?\"Maybe not.Chung-Myung stared at Yoo-Esul's face. It is full of signs that no matter how many times I open it, I have no idea. If this is acting, it is better to quit the sword and turn into a kyung drama actor. I'll be able to perform in front of the emperor.But I don't think Yoo-Esul, who has a blind spot, will be able to act perfectly.Chung-Myung's spirits go up in smoke.'Do it.'Even if he saw a rank in Jongnam, he would not be able to learn the method of plum blossoms properly. Plum Blossom is a meaningful technique with Hawasan's inner strength....but don't tell me you've stolen the inner workings of Hawasan.Are you sure?Chung-Myung, who returned with a smiling face, shrugs his shoulders and asks.\"What do you mean, you've seen it before?\"Yoo-Esul's face is a little blank.\"A long time ago.\"Yoo-Esul, who was looking at the dark sky as if he was recalling old memories, said with a stern face again.\"Teach me.\"\"You really don't know.\"\"Really?\"Yoo-Esul nodded.Have you finally given up?'Then I'm glad...\"There's nothing we can do about it.\"\"Yes, now you understand\u2026\u2026.\"Snarling.The sword is pulled out of Yoo-Esul's waist. Chung-Myung looked at the scene with a frightened face.\"Oh, no, Black, why all of a sudden!\"\"You're not going to teach me, are you?\"Is this a crazy b*tc*?You're pulling out a sword just because you don't teach me how to do it. What the hell did they do to raise this as a disciple?\"Why pull out the sword if you're not going to teach me?\"\"Because you're right.\"\"What?\"\"I'm an accident, you're a disaster.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Then I'll teach you.\"Yoo-Esul picks up the sword and points at Chung-Myung.Chung-Myung smiled pleased at the sight.No wonder white porcelain pears aren't close to her.'Of course you are. Because I'm out of my mind.\"Isn't it because you're obsessed with plum blossoms that you're asking for flowers?\"'If you put a plum flower on your head, it would be easy to identify, so I think it would be good for each other.

And it was as elegant as it could be.Pierce in sharply and bend gently. It shakes like an illusion and pokes it in lightly again.Hwasan's sword.Since returning to Hawaii, Chung-Myung has seen numerous swords. The same celadon boat, of course, saw the sword of the Ungold, and sometimes had the opportunity to see the swords of the elders.But now this sword before him is closer to the source of Hawasan than anyone else's sword.To the point where I get a little sentimental when I look at it.Why is it be?Because her tendencies resemble those of Hwasan? Or...\"Blank!\"At that moment, Yoo-Esul's sword pierces Chung-Myung's face at a speed of light.Chung-Myung turned her head and avoided her sword.Let's start.A few strands of bangs are cut off.\"Gasp!\"No, this crazy b*tc* really stings.\"Are you crazy? If you can't avoid it, you're dead!\"\"There's no way you can't avoid it.\"\"Why do you have confidence in me?\"What happened to your hair? Why isn't the mindset normal?No wonder you have a pretty face, but you don't have any friends.But there is no room for argument.Yoo-Esul's sword, which comes after Chung-Myung, is getting sharper. I'm sure he'll have enough time to deal with it.Uh... as long as you can attack.If you swing the sword wrong once, you will become a fan lover by accident and tapping it. That's why we have to stop them from getting hurt.Claw claw clawning liquid!\"Don't use salcho, woman!\"\"It's an accident!\"What kind of accident uses salcho on a scoundrel? What happened to your hair?\"Oh, my goodness. Hwasan has come all the way here!Chung-Myung's forehead, which had been lamenting inside, was frowned for a moment.Perhaps because he could attack with salcho as much as he wanted, he could see Yoo-Esul getting drunk with the sword. For example, the eyes become a little dazed and the sword deviates from the set path.'Ho?'You realize it in the middle of a fight?I can't even bring Jo-Gol.'In terms of talent for swords, Hawasan may be the best.'No, it's not.Chung-Myung sneaks out the wooden sword and pushes the sword to the wrong sword and puts it on its own.The stage of going into a trance and finding one's own sword path. Ordinary people would have been in a hurry to step down without daring to intervene. If you mess with the wrong person, your enlightenment may fly away in a moment, and if you mess with it, you may have the worst case of getting into the mouth of coins.By Chung-Myung, we can anticipate and identify all these censuses and lead them to the right path.Not there. Right, here. No. No. It's here.'Talk. Talk. Talk.Chung-Myung stretches out the sword and touches Yoo-Esul's sword to lead it to the correct one. Chung-Myung is the only one who can do this kind of thing in a situation where the grass is flying.\u2026.\"What are you doing? Inooooooooooh!Chung-Myung turned his head to sudden intervention.Baek Cheon, who seemed to have lost his temper with anger, was running toward him at a mad pace.Why are you coming out there, dude?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What the hell is going on with you?While thinking for a while, Baek Cheon's sword flies threateningly toward Chung-Myung. He aimed at Chung-Myung's shoulder, emitting a black and blue energy filled with energy.It's okay to aim for a place that's not a critical point even though your eyes are completely turned around.only\"If you put your sword in there, it'll kill you anyway! You crazy man!\"Chung-Myung kicked the flying sword.Whoops!The sword with the sword bumped against the foot, and absurdly, the sound of metal bursts out. Back Cheon, who couldn't handle the reverse power, rolled back.\"Huh?\"Rising up, Baek Cheon alternated between Chung-Myung and his sword with an incredible face. It happened so quickly that he didn't even understand how it bounced off.\"Tzut.\"Chung-Myung kicked his tongue long and quickly examined Yoo-Esul's condition. I'm sure there's been a lot of drinking next to him while he's in Moa.\u2026.\"That's nice, huh?Normally, this much binge would have been enough to escape, but Yoo-Esul was still in a trance.He's slow.It's too slow.But now I've benefited from that dullness. It is not common for a person to fall into a trance while wielding a sword.In the Buddhist temple, it is sometimes referred to as a \"dismissal\" in the sense that it forgets itself and throws off its shell to open a new stage. It's an absolutely crucial moment for a no man.If I had woken up from this crash, I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.\"What are you doing? Don't you know how important a moment of no-man is?\"Is that what you know?Chung-Myung opened his eyes wide and looked at Baek Cheon.I was wondering why you were angry.\"Touched a man in a trance! No matter how little common sense you have, there are things you can't do! You're such a badass!\"Baek Cheon even stood out and stared at Chung-Myung.\"It's true that I didn't think well of you, but I didn't think you'd be a d*mn man to mess with an accident in Moa! I should've broken your habit earlier!\"Chung-Myung sighed deeply.No, man. I didn't touch you. I helped you.How would you know that? It's all my fault. It's my fault.I'm convinced, but words don't go out well.\"Does anyone who knows it pull out a sword and come at me?\"\"What did you say?\"\"What if you hurt your precious accident?\"\"If only you hadn't fought back\u2026\u2026!\"\"Death?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"When Chung-Myung answered in a sullen manner, Baek Cheon stammered in bewilderment.\"Have all the white porcelain ships been collected by the madmen?\"The world is usually dominated by sane people, and there are occasional madmen mixed in. But these white porcelain bastards seem to have the opposite proportion of the madman and the normal man.First of all, there is no normal person among the white porcelain belly Chung-Myung has talked to so far.If Yoon-jong had heard it, he would've been mad at the dog with something on it, but it's not here.\"How can I kill you?\"\"It's got a lot of flesh.\"\"\u2026\u2026it's so urgent.\"\"You even pulled the sword.\"\"\u2026\u2026that, that.\"Baek Cheon's face, which was flinching while listening to Chung-Myung, becomes blank for a moment.No, wait a second.As Chung-Myung said. They loaded the house and pulled out the sword. But how can he be so fine without a scratch?So Baek Cheon took a punch with all his might and didn't mean anything.\"Get away from your brother-in-law!\"Baek Cheon's face hardens. And spoke in a determined tone.\"I won't ask you what you were doing any more. But put down your sword right now and step back. Otherwise you'll have to go through me today as an unmanned, not as a private residence.\"That's nice.Chung-Myung was delighted.\"Oh, really?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Wow, that's what I really wanted.\"Until the end...\u2026.\"Baek Cheon gritted his teeth.A man needs a lot of reverse. If you put yourself in perspective, you can fully understand Baek Cheon's anger now. In his common sense, something that shouldn't have happened.So it was originally right to step down from here.If there is one problem...\u2026.Chung-Myung turned his head, smacking his lips.'If you fix this a little bit more, you'll get a really big one.'Yoo-Esul is now in a lifelong realization. It's random, but enlightenment often comes out of the blue in the first place.While some people do not get a single realization even if they struggle for the rest of their lives, others just come to realize while eating. You can't do it with effort, and you can't do it because you want to.It's just a matter of heaven.And Yoo-Esul's biggest miracle is not in Moa. Chung-Myung was next to him at the time of Muah.Basically a trance person forgets himself and falls into the sword only. In the meantime, he breaks away from the sword he knew and unfolds a new sword, and also examines the higher ground.That is why no one should mess with the innocent. This is because if the sword is not properly dealt with, it could cause a big accident.But who is Chung-Myung.He is a great servant who understands all of Hawasan's swords and has stepped into a position where no one has ever climbed. It has yet to be implemented with this body, but it is hard to find anyone who has more than Chung-Myung even considering the history of Hwasan's understanding of swordsmanship is hard to find.So we can intervene in Yoo-Esul's Moa and lead her sword to a higher place...\u2026.\"Why does he show up?\"It is ambiguous to lead in front of others. If you do something wrong, it can get bigger endlessly.Chung-Myung glanced at Yoo-Esul and smacked his lips.What can I do? It's your blessing.'One master is missing to lead Hawasan, but Chung-Myung has no regrets about the ship that has already left. But...It's a different thing to beat the guy who made you miss the boat.'Chung-Myung, a couple of steps away from Yoo-Esul, glared at Baek Cheon.\"Done?\"\"More.\"\"Tsk.\"Chung-Myung is two steps away from Yoo-Esul again.\"Okay?\"\"\u2026\u2026are you kidding me? Get off properly. I have no intention of letting you harm your brother-in-law.\"\"No harm can be done. The sun is setting there.\"\"You?\"Chung-Myung looked up at the sky with a speechless face at Baek Cheon's angry return.'Are they filled with honorifics?'Yoo-Esul said that, and Baek Cheon gets angry when he talks too short. If Confucius comes back alive, they'll be his disciples right away.\"Yes, private residence. I think the problem is private residence.\"Baek Cheon stares at Chung-Myung with cold eyes.\"I tried to understand your indulgence somehow.\"What?You've been trying to make trouble by picking up all kinds of faults, and now you're a master...\u2026. Oh, is this you too. Anyway, why did that come into the conduit?\"But my patience is limited. And there are some people in the world who can't communicate.\"\"Wow\u2026\u2026\"Baek Cheon frowns as Chung-Myung exclaims.\"What are you trying to say?\"\"No, no. It's just amazing.\"\"What?\"\"You wouldn't know if I tell you.\"It's been a hundred years, and how can you say the same thing as the death penalty?- There's no point in talking to him.- It would be faster to recite the book to a cow or a chicken than to discuss the morality to the death penalty.If you can't fight, you won't tell me.People are all alike in shape.Otherwise, Chung-Myung hasn't changed for 100 years.Baek Cheon spoke sharply to Chung-Myung, who grinned and wondered.\"Listen to the sword. I'll teach you what your habits are today.\"\"Are you okay?\"\"Hey!\"\"No, no. It's not that...\u2026, in a hurry.\"Baek Cheon narrows his forehead as Chung-Myung flirts.\"What do you want to say?\"\"No, I'm just worried. But I thought it would hurt your face if you fought against the enemy even though it's a private residence.\"Baek Cheon smirks.\"Do you want to come here and save face? You're wrong if you think your private servants or elders will protect you. I don't know about the future, but they can't protect you at this moment. It's a punishment. You'll get it later.\"\"I haven't heard that in a while.\"Chung-Myung nods his head in a blemish.\"But there's a better way for me, would you like to hear it?\"\"\u2026\u2026what are you trying to do?\"\"No, it's not that. It's just us making an oath. I don't tell anyone in the world what happened here.\"\"What?\"Chung-Myung smiles.\"I'm saying I won't reach out to my housekeepers if I get beaten up. You can't run over and tell a man that he lost a fight. Don't you think so?\"Baek Cheon looked at Chung-Myung with strange eyes.What's he thinking?'Baek Cheon, who slightly checked his expression, said with a straight face.\"You're trying to get away with this, and now you think I'm going to let it slide? You are... ...\"\"No, it's not that.\"Chung-Myung sighed because he couldn't overcome the frustration.\"Let's just get rid of everything, whether it's private or private, or door-to-door. Let's just get it clean. Don't hold grudges. Isn't that better for each other?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"If we promise each other, I won't tell my superiors what I'm going to do. If you say anything, I'll do anything you want me to do. Of course, it's the same for sure. What do you think?\"Baek Cheon put on a subtle smile.\"But you have a manly side. All right, I swear if you want me to. I won't tell anyone what happened here.\"There is no reason not to accept that offer from Baek Cheon's point of view.The hardest part of hitting Chung-Myung was the stomach and the stomach. Isn't it obvious that Chung-Myung, who is protected by them, rushed to Baek Cheon to clean up the mess as soon as possible?But you're going to get rid of that uncomfortable part by yourself. Baek Cheon has no reason to say no.But\u2026\u2026 I can't get rid of my feeling of frustration.\"Then I swear.\"\"Yes, you are, too.\"\"Yes, I swear.\"\"Then the grudges are gone.\"Baek Cheon lifted the sword and pointed at Chung-Myung.\"But I'll admit you're a manly man. I'm not your private residence, and you're not my cup of tea. And I'll clean up all the bad feelings I had for you with this dagger. You, too... ...\"\"Bimu?\"At that moment, the crooked voice of Chung-Myung cuts off Baek Cheon's words.Baek Cheon looked at Chung-Myung with curious eyes.'Huh?'And Baek Cheon watched it.Chung-Myung is smiling with a completely different, evil face.\"Who said rain? You're dead now, you son of a b*tc*.\"Chung-Myung sniffed and walked toward Baek Cheon.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It looks like a back alley minnow threatening the people.There were only two reasons Baek Cheon was embarrassed.One is that Chung-Myung's acting like a minnow suits him so well. And the other was the fact that it was none other than Baek Cheon that Chung-Myung is threatening now.\"Unless you've lost your mind?'Baek Cheon is Chung-Myung's private residence.Of course, it's not important because Baek Cheon said in his own words that it's not about distribution.The important thing was that Baek Cheon and Chung-Myung had a different distribution.Baek Cheon entered Hwasan when he was younger than Chung-Myung now. In other words, it means that the years of learning martial arts have already passed fifteen years.On the other hand, what about Chung-Myung?It's only been half a year.Even if he learned martial arts from his mother's stomach, he could not have studied it longer than Baek Cheon. In other words, even if Chung-Myung's talent is second to that of Ambassador Dharma or Sambongjinin, it is impossible to beat Baek Cheon now.A law that requires at least time for talent to manifest itself.Who would try and learn martial arts if only talent could surpass the walls of time neatly?But what's that reaction?'But Chung-Myung is acting like he deserves to beat Baek Cheon. I'm speechless because I'm embarrassed.\"\u2026\u2026you've really gone mad.\"\"Come on, no. You're the one who's crazy.\"\"What?\"\"Are you going to pick a fight with me without going crazy?\"If those who were entangled with Chung-Myung in the past were here now, everyone would have nodded in line with each other.It is Chung-Myung, who was called the only evil spirit in Jongnam and the province in Wudang. Chung-Myung's reputation shot through the sky, but his notoriety covered the earth.f*ck you.Chung-Myung let go of his hand.Surprisingly, Chung-Myung doesn't have a strong preference for violence in the first place.Yes?What have you done so far?He won't listen to me if I don't beat him up.For Chung-Myung, violence is only a means. What he ultimately wants is for everyone to do well on their own without touching it and forcing it.Why would anyone use force and violence if that were the case? It's a problem because it doesn't work well.But now Chung-Myung is tempted to use violence for purposes, not means, for the first time in a while.\"Your indulgence knows no bounds. My hands are strong, grudges...\u2026.\"\"Go ahead.\"\"\u2026\u2026what did you just say?\"Chung-Myung shrugged.\"I don't usually like to talk much before a fight, but you listen. After a while, you won't be able to talk even if you want to.\"\"You're the one that's it!\"Baek Cheon grabbed the sword.He also had no intention of dragging his feet any longer.'I'm going to kill you.'Baek Cheon gritted his teeth. You can't cut a priest with a sword, no matter how hard it is. But it can be beaten with the index finger. Now that this has happened, I was going to chop it up so that I could pee a little bit just by making eye contact.Baek Cheon grabbed the sword tightly and rushed towards Chung-Myung.Baek Cheon's sword flies quickly to Chung-Myung. A sword distinctly different from that of Yoo-Esul. At first glance they may look alike, but they were much heavier and steeper than her sword.In a way, it's the right way.It is a sword that minimizes the colorful changes that are the basis of the Hawaiian sword and preserves its strong taste. With a single second of inspection, Chung-Myung identified Baek Cheon's tendencies.It's weird.Jong-nam abandoned his sword and tried to resemble Hawasan's splendor. But Baek Cheon, on the contrary, reduced the splendor of Hawasan and captured Jongnam's honesty in his sword.'Do it.'If you think about it, it's a matter of course.Sword changes all the time. And the direction of change is more advanced. We have no choice but to aim for a better looking position.Jong-nam, who was crushed by Chung-Myung in the heyday of Hwasan, would have considered Hwasan's splendor the answer.On the other hand, Hwasan's great disciples, who realized the gap through the Hwajong Branch, would have considered Jongnam's sword as the answer.It is understandable that we try to resemble each other.One!'Pathetic things.'Chung-Myung narrowed his forehead.You mean you learn Jongnam's sword because you have nothing to learn? I don't like everything about this dude anyway.\"A guy who can't even digest what he has wants someone else's?\"'I think I should let you know. Let's see what Hwasan has.Then Baek Cheon rushed in and started to work.\"I'll break your habit today.\"Then Chung-Myung clenched his fist as he watched Baek Cheon rushing in.\"My!\"Pull your right foot back one foot.\"Habit!\"My back is twisting backwards.\"Until now!\"And a fist pulled back as far as it can go bouncing forward.\"No one has fixed it, you son of a b*tc*!\"Show off.Chung-Myung's circle penetrates the change of the sword made by Baek Cheon. A volume that stretches at the right angle and at the right speed, aiming for between change and change.Baek Cheon opened his eyes wide as he saw Chung-Myung's fist coming through his screenings.It's easy to say. What's wrong with cramming your fist into a change of sword that cuts your arm when you touch it?Baek Cheon's point of view was no different from the ghost's hand popping out of the blackness.But there wasn't much time to be surprised.Screaming!Baek Cheon's jaw is spinning.Plump plop knock knock knock knock knock knock knock.I can hear something off my neck. At the moment, consciousness flies away and returns.When I came to my senses, his body was bouncing back that much.'What?'What's going on?The sense of reality disappears. Baek Cheon didn't really realize what had happened to his body in the midst of bouncing off. And a sense of distant reality hits him momentarily.Boom!\"Gasp!\"As soon as the body was stuck on the floor, the indescribable pain covered the whole body.\"Oops.\"A stuck back is rather fine. The real pain spreads from the jaw.Baek Cheon groaned with his chin clasped.Learning martial arts is no different from being used to suffering. As well as the pain of pushing the body to the limit, it is also common to be injured by dangling and splashing.But this was different from any pain he'd ever suffered. It feels like a new world of pain is opening.\"Wake up, man.\"Chung-Myung approaches Baek Cheon, turning his head from side to side.Baek Cheon, who saw it, got up from his seat with a wailing. Then Chung-Myung opened his eyes unexpectedly.\"Oh, you're up.\"You told me to wake up.While enduring the pain felt on his chin, Baek Cheon felt like his heart was being sucked away just by understanding the current situation.Nevertheless, he lifted the sword, desperately calming his fluttering legs.I can taste the fishy blood in my mouth.\"Uh, how?\"Baek Cheon is not a fool.The exchange of blows earlier is no accident. There is no one in the world who will push his arm into the sword for luck.In other words, it means that Baek Cheon's sword was clearly visible to Chung-Myung's eyes.\"How to freeze to death.\"Chung-Myung looked at Baek Cheon as if he were pathetic.\"Do you think there's a loophole in the way that you've reduced the changes by fixing the original sword that was made on the premise of change? These things know one thing and they don't know two things. Of course there are plenty of gaps!\"Blood stood in Baek Cheon's eyes.\"Noo, no one has found such a gap.\"\"Well, he's pretty good with the guys you're dealing with. I would've figured it out if I'd been an elder right now.\"Maybe not.Uh... what is the level of elders now? What?Let's move on.\"Is my sword wrong?\"\"Yeah.\"Chung-Myung spoke as if he had nothing to think about.\"Now you can get a little ahead of others based on that. But as time goes by, your priests will begin to overtake you.\"\"How do you know such a thing? You're just a newbie! I can't believe it.\"\"Oh, whatever.\"Chung-Myung grinned.The student of Hwasan is doing the same thing Jongnam did. And Chung-Myung understood why this was happening.It's not weird right now.'Perhaps even in Chung-Myung's time, this kind of thing happened countless times. But Chung-Myung at the time just didn't know what the consequences of such a change would be.Having experienced numerous things and experienced high ground, I had an eye to see how the sword would develop. Seeing those who were just making swords with their eyes, things that had not been seen before began to be seen.\"Thank you for being a disciple of Hawasan.\"\"What?\"Chung-Myung lifted the wooden sword.I want to punch him to death, but isn't he still a cute student of Hawasan? Even if it's beaten, I'll try to help develop it.\"Don't worry. I'll beat you with a sword, not a fist. Wow, I'm so kind.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Are you crazy?No, I think he's crazy.Chung-Myung breathed deeply as he looked at the bewildered Baek Cheon.\"Some say that Hawasan's sword is aimed at resembling plum blossoms. But that's what people who don't know much about Hawasan's sword say. It's not mimicking Hawasan's black plum blossoms. Hwasan's sword aims to...\u2026.\"Chung-Myung, who was speaking seriously, suddenly frowned.\"Oh, I don't know. Do you understand that you hear me. It's easy to understand when you're beaten with your body. I'm coming!\"\"Uh, uh?\"Baek Cheon stepped back without realizing it.However, Chung-Myung's speed was twice as fast as that.Baek Cheon swings the sword and slaps Chung-Myung. His instincts as an inspection were swinging the sword faster than his head.But at the moment Baek Cheon saw.Chung-Myung's fingertips seemed to shake slightly, and his wooden sword swelled to dozens, filling his vision.'What's this is...\u2026?'\"Lower body!\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!The wooden sword hits Baek Cheon on the shin. Baek Cheon literally opened his mouth in a tearful pain.But it's not over.\"Wrist!\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!Chung-Myung's sword struck Baek Cheon on the wrist holding the sword accurately. I almost lost my sword because I felt like my wrist and hands were almost gone.Burr, Bertie....'At that time, Baek Cheon's ears are filled with sounds that he doesn't want to hear.\"Head, head, head, head! Head, head, head! Head!\"Why not just once, dude?Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!Baek Cheon, who was hit by a series of blows that seemed to explode his head, opened his mouth and went over to the morrow.Even until the moment he collapsed, there was an idea that dominated Baek Cheon's head.Why did you say five times and hit me six times?'It was an unsolved question even at the moment when the consciousness flew away.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Baek Cheon, moaning with a splitting headache, barely opens his eyes.How long have I been out?'I can't get the idea of time. It's been a long time, and I think I just woke up. As soon as I opened my eyes, I saw the dark sky, and fortunately it didn't stretch for more than half a day.\"Turn it off.\"When I turned my head slightly, I saw Yoo-Esul wielding a sword slowly from a little distance.I don't think it's been too long.'Of course, the self-absorbed cannot deduce time from her appearance alone, as she sometimes fails to return to reality, not only for a day, but also for four days.Baek Cheon, who barely managed to get up on the floor, can hear a familiar and unfamiliar voice if it is familiar.\"Are you awake?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The head goes round and round.Chung-Myung, squatting with a wooden sword on his shoulder, came into view.Flinching.Baek Cheon's body cramps and retreats into shock before his head can react.\"Surprised.\"Chung-Myung smiles.Baek Cheon opened his eyes wide, stared at him, and sighed.\"You lost.\"No, I didn't lose.The fight a while ago was embarrassing to discuss winning or losing. I still don't understand how this could happen, but the bottom line is one anyway.He lost completely.Baek Cheon raised his hand and pressed his head hard. The head that was beaten by Chung-Myung was still ringing like a bell.But it's not a situation to call a bluff. The scoundrel who knocked himself out was watching with his eyes wide open.\"Can I ask you a question?\"\"How much you want.\"\"\u2026\u2026how can you be so strong?\"\"Whoa?\"Chung-Myung looked at Baek Cheon with new eyes.It's amazing.Usually those who have experienced this nonsense do not acknowledge reality. I can't believe this is happening in front of my eyes.No, I can't admit it.You're bound to babble and run wild.In particular, those who are proud of themselves often refuse to admit their death until they put their fists in their babbling muzzles.However, Baek Cheon quickly admits to the current situation even though he seems to be a man who feeds off pride.That's one of the advantages I can count as an advantage.\u2026.\"I'm not strong, I'm weak.\"\"Me?\"\"Yes.\"Baek Cheon's eyes trembled a little.\"I'm weak?\"\"Yes.\"Baek Cheon stumbled out of his seat. Then he glared at Chung-Myung with deathly eyes.\"Don't ignore me. I am Baek Cheon. He is the ambassador of the white porcelain ship, the best man, and one day he will be a long-winded writer of the Hawaiian language and lead the way.\"\"Oh, right.\"Chung-Myung nodded gently. There was nothing wrong with Baek Cheon's words now.Just one thing.\"But that doesn't mean it's not weak, does it?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"As Baek Cheon tries to refute something, Chung-Myung raises his finger and points to him.\"A frog in a well.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"That's just the right thing to say to a private residence. Well, it's also a narrow one that other frogs don't even think about coming in. A frog that is puffing up in it.\"Baek Cheon's face is horribly distorted.\"I'm a frog?\"\"Yes.\"\"Me?\"Chung-Myung grinned at Baek Cheon, who couldn't admit it and kept asking back.\"Excuse me, private residence.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Doesn't the private residence already know that Hwasan is doomed?\"\"\u2026\u2026of course.\"It's hard to say it's ruined, but there's no denying it's down.It was Baek Cheon's role to revive the fallen Hawasan. Baek Cheon has believed in that so far.\"But that's why I've been trying. Somehow, I can't help but...\u2026.\"\"Household?\"Chung-Myung looks at Baek Cheon with absurd eyes.\"When?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Baek Cheon was speechless at Chung-Myung's reaction.\"I don't think so at all. Play house with the kids to close the store, give them a cool drink on the way back, and try to pick on the ingredients when there's not much time left. Oh, my god.\"Baek Cheon shut up.I don't think I've lacked effort myself. But there was nothing to say about Chung-Myung's point.\"I don't think private education knows what effort is, but it's not an effort to do everything you want and spend the rest of your time. It's an effort to reduce what I want to do.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Sasuk is not an effort. Just wanted to reign like a king in a little kingdom called Hawasan. I don't have any competition, I don't have anyone to nag about. Was it comfortable?\"Baek Cheon bit his lips gently.\"No, no. You don't have to look like that. I'm not saying anything to the private residence. But if you refuse to be compared to others and want to live like a king in them, at least don't say you tried. And we have to get rid of the illusion that we are strong.\"Chung-Myung said bluntly.\"Have you ever fought anyone right?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"It must have been Jong-nam at best. Private residence. Jongnam is considered the grim reaper here, but overall, Jongnam is only one of the top 10 at most. The other students of the Old File Room are flying in the sky now, are you strong that you can jump a little? It's strong? Private residence?\"There was a glaring sneer on Chung-Myung's face.\"Don't get me wrong, you frog. It's not that I'm strong. You guys are weak.\"A loud alarm went off in Baek Cheon's head.\"I'm weak?'I don't want to admit it.However, Chung-Myung's words were not wrong at all.Hawasan is struggling with one Jongnam. In fact, even if he plays a role in this Hwajong Branch to defeat Jongnam, there are definitely literary groups in the world that go beyond Jongnam.\"\u2026\u2026so there are many stronger men in the Tamun faction than you?\"\"What are you talking about? I'm the strongest!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"That doesn't add up, you son of a b*tc*!\"But it's not because I'm strong that I've been forced to stay-at-home. You can't beat Jongnam-do at this private residence. Of course, there is no comparison with the disciples of places where Gijae rolls on the floor, such as Sori, Wudang, or Namgungse.\"Baek Cheon bites his lips tightly.But Chung-Myung mercilessly threw a rock at Baek Cheon's plexus.\"So even if it's not me, it's not rocket science to knock down a private residence. Do you understand?\"I understood.But I don't want to understand.Who in the world would truly want to understand the phrase 'You are just one of the grains of sand in the world'?But Baek Cheon clenched his teeth instead of protesting.\"I know that.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"You don't think your student at Hawasan knows that? I know. I know. But there's nothing we can do. Unless I am a shaman or a disciple of Namgung, I have no choice but to try with what I have!\"\"I didn't make the effort, man.\"Chung-Myung adds with a glum face.\"I didn't make the right effort, and the direction of the effort was wrong. Do you think you'll become a master just because you work hard? Then let's go over there and play Scarecrow. If you play 500 years, you might be able to use your lectures.\"Chung-Myung knows how to offend people even if they say the same thing.Baek Cheon asked, crumpling his face to the fullest.\"So you know the right direction?\"\"At least you know better than a private residence.\"Chung-Myung grinned.Baek Cheon sighed low at his response.You're a goblin.I don't understand him at all. How to be so strong, how to be so confident. And how the hell he's so relaxed. Baek Cheon's common sense doesn't make sense.'So you have to be cocky.'In Chung-Myung's eyes, white porcelain pears would have seemed nothing but condescending because of their lack of skills and high distribution.If Baek Cheon was worse than Chung-Myung, it wouldn't have been less.There's only one thing for sure.Chung-Myung is stronger than Baek Cheon can imagine. I don't know why, but Chung-Myung may be stronger than Unja-bae.Even if Baek Cheon does Woonam or Woonam, he won't get beaten up unilaterally like before.Baek Cheon looks at Chung-Myung with determined determination in his eyes after a short time of consideration.\"Then you can make me stronger?\"\"Whoa?\"Chung-Myung squinted at Baek Cheon's words.I'm sure he's a little weird.'Pride is too strong. However, it is aware of reality. Usually, if one thing is broken, the other side is also broken.So to put it mildly, this private man is a self-respecting man who knows his situation clearly.Isn't it terrible as a human being?However, it is not bad for a military man. At the end of the day, the warrior is the strongest. Or because you live on the pride that you will be the strongest.\"Of course I can.\"Baek Cheon nodded still.\"Then....\"Then, he reaches out his hands to win the lottery.\"Huh?\"And he opened his mouth in an absolutely serious voice.\"Then make me stronger. I'll do whatever you tell me to do.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Baek Cheon slightly raises his head.\"As long as I can be strong, I would not mind learning from temperament. If the relationship between private and private property is burdensome, I will not treat you as a private property. If you want me to be your brother, I'll take you as my brother.\u2026.\"\"I don't want to.\"\"As a teacher...\" Huh?Chung-Myung answers in a dart way.\"No, I don't want to.\"\"\u2026\u2026why?\"Baek Cheon's eyes are shaking.Didn't we talk about that to show Baek Cheon the way?\"Why me? I'm bothering you.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"And you must be mistaken, private residence.\"\"Huh?\"\"It's not over yet.\"Chung-Myung got up from his seat. Then lift the wooden sword and spin it around.\"There's something strange about being a person. You don't even think about what you've done, you compromise on your own. I'm sure you've paid enough for your crime.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. I paid for it. That's enough for the old man who bullied the three great disciples. But!\"Chung-Myung's eyes were on fire.\"My anger doesn't end like that!\"No, you're crazy.Back Cheon stepped back to freak out.But Chung-Myung slowly approached Baek Cheon with an evil smile like a grim reaper.\"I don't think it's understandable. Right?\"\"No, I understand! I've already convinced you!\"\"No, no. I still don't understand private accommodation. I'm sure you're still confused about how this is happening.\"Why do you decide my condition?She said I was convinced!\"Don't worry. The night is long. I will convince you today. Why private education is weak and why private education is wrong. And\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung's eyes sparkle.\"Why shouldn't you touch me.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I'm coming!\"\"Gasp!\"Scream from Nakan Peak unfortunately did not reach the home of Hawasan.Unfortunately.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chung-Myung smiles at that.\"Ummingling.\"I beat it to the ground, but I beat it without hurting myself, so I'll be able to wake up after I faint for a while. It hurts, though, all day long.\"Yes, it's comfortable to beat it up like this!\"I shouldn't have thought about it. It's nothing to do with Chung-Myung whether his Hwajong branch goes well or not.\"\u2026\u2026no.\"Come to think of it, I can't see Jongnam guys coming to Hawasan to be elated.\"Well, I mean, how about...\u2026aaaaaah! Scared me! Argh!Chung-Myung, who was squatting and agonizing, was surprised and rolled to the side by side. It was because of Yoo-Esul, who squatted next to him and stared at Chung-Myung.\"No, seriously! You're not a ghost!\"We have to do something about that. At this rate, he will die of a heart attack before Hawasan can be revived.\"Give me a heads up! Stuck!\"\"I did!\"\"When!\"\"When I was beating it up.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung glanced at Baek Cheon, still stretching like a corpse, and turned to Yoo-Esul again.A gentle smile blooms around his mouth.\"Did you see that?\"\"Yes.\"\"Did you see it all?\"\"From a little while ago.\"\"Hmmm.\"\"Homicide Extinction?\"\"No, it's gone too far.\"Do you have to kill me, kill me.Chung-Myung looked closely at the head of Yoo-Esul.Then she tilted her head.\"Why?\"\"No, I thought I'd forget if I hit the back of my head in moderation. Or amnesia.\"\"\u2026\u2026forgot it.\"\"Really?\"\"Yes, I forgot everything.\"It's hard, but it has a survival instinct.Chung-Myung opened his eyes slightly. Then Yoo-Esul said quietly.\"Tell me the sword instead.\"She doesn't know how to give up. Are you a flame wife of fire.\u2026.So far, I've skipped it roughly, but now it's hard to skip it. Moreover, didn't you see Chung-Myung beat Baek Cheon excitedly? Now pretending is not going to work.Then change the strategy.Chung-Myung sighed deeply and opened his mouth.\"Why do you want to learn that?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yoo-Esul wince, perhaps because it was an unexpected counterattack. Then I looked at Chung-Myung with a hint of bewilderment. What should I say? Emotions are shown on the face.\u2026.'He can never lie in front of others.'Yoo-Esul hesitated for a moment and opened his mouth.\"I can't tell you why\u2026\u2026.\"His hesitating voice smeared his sincerity.\"I must learn the sword.\"Chung-Myung still looks at Yoo-Esul.I don't think it's because plum blossoms are pretty.'There is a young eagerness in the eyes. There must be a story that Chung-Myung can't guess.\"Do you want to learn?\"Yoo-Esul nods his head.\"Nothing to ask.\"\"Huh?\"\"That's the original sword of Hawasan. If you wait, you'll learn it naturally.\"\"\u2026\u2026It's no longer in Hawaii.\"\"Whoa?\"You know it's not in Wasan?Then, it means that Chung-Myung recognized that the sword was a plum blossom sword. Although it's exactly a Chung-Myung variant of plumage.Chung-Myung nodded.\"Yes, it's not in Wasan right now.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"But I'll be back soon. When you're ready.\"\"Ready?\"Chung-Myung looked at Yoo-Esul quietly. Instead of answering her questions, Chung-Myung reaches out his hand and points to the sky.Soon, Chung-Myung's hands travel smoothly through Ho Gong.Yoo-Esul tilted his head at first because he did not understand Chung-Myung's gesture, but soon realized that his hands were drawing a sword path and looked at the fingertips with serious eyes.\"The moon girl sword, isn't it?\"\"Yes.\"Yoo-Esul is slowly sucked into Chung-Myung's gesture.It was definitely a bayonet sword.Yoo-Esul learned the most time and polished for the longest time.But Chung-Myung's Black Moon Daughter was something different from Yoo-Esul's. Rather than just different movements, there seemed to be a fundamental difference.When the long, short, long, and short-term gestures were over, Yoo-Esul let out a sigh.\"Did you understand?\"Yoo-Esul shakes his head.\"No, I don't know.\"As soon as Chung-Myung tries to say something, Yoo-Esul starts talking first.\"But it's my job to figure it out. I think I know what you mean. You mean you can't learn unless a certain level goes up, right?\"\"Right.\"\"We must first lay the groundwork by grinding what is now.\"\"You know it well.\"Yoo-Esul nods slowly.\"Okay.\"Chung-Myung looked at Yoo-Esul with new eyes.I thought you were blind, but you're smart, too.'Well, personality and brain are two different things. I think that's possible.\"Yes, but if you tell me what happened today somewhere else, I'll never tell you.\"\"I won't tell you.\"\"Good boy.\"When Chung-Myung nodded, Yoo-Esul opened his eyes thinly.\"I'm your accident. You're my temper.\"\"I know, I know. Yeah, that's nice boy.\"\u2026\u2026.\"You can see Yoo-Esul's hand holding the sword is slightly. Chung-Myung quickly turned around.\"Then I'll see you later, accident. Don't come to me until you're good. 'Cause it's annoying.\"Excuse me...\"Yoo-Esul reached out and tried to catch Chung-Myung, but he trudged down the mountain without waiting.\"Oh, and throw that idiot in the room. If you leave it here, your mouth will turn.\"Yoo-Esul sighed at Chung-Myung's voice, which was already heard from afar.Plum Blossoms.Chung-Myung smokes plum blossoms at the end of the sword.It's a sight I've never seen even when I came to Hawaii.It's just...Yoo-Esul closed his eyes.The sword begins to move in her head. The tip of the sword, which was moving smoothly, shook, and soon began to bloom clear plum blossoms.apricot blossomAnd the end of the sword.And a man holding a sword.\"Father.- I will surely restore this sword. And one day I'd like to go back to Hawaii and beg for my fault. Seol, come with me. Hwasan is a great place.And in the end, his sword did not smoke full plum blossoms.But now there's a plum blossom person in front of her.\"I have to learn.\"Somehow.* * *Bang!Chung-Myung stormed in the door of the white plum.\"Gasp!\"\"Here it comes!\"And I faced an unexpected out of the blue murder.\"What?\"Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jong were waiting for him on the first floor, though it was still early in the morning.\"You must have been comfortable with training. Do you see me awake at this hour?\"\"No, it was a mess!\"\"Huh?\"\"Baek Cheon's death penalty is gone, and private servants came to the White House.\"What a bunch of weirdos.Baek Cheon is gone. Why are you coming to the White House? Don't tell me Chung-Myung would have kidnapped him...\u2026.Ah.I didn't think of that. You could've picked it up and beaten it.There seems to be a smart student among his students.\"You're doubting me for no reason. It's offensive.\"Yoon-jong was delighted by Chung-Myung's words.\"I guess it wasn't about you! Fortunately... ...\"\"That's right, isn't it?\"\u2026\u2026.\"But why do you feel so bad, man? It's no offense!No, this isn't the point right now!\"You were with Baek Cheon?\"\"Yes.\"\"Seo, don't tell me\u2026\u2026It's not what I think it is, is it?\"\"What are you thinking?\"Yoon-jong smiled awkwardly.\"I don't think so, but I'm sure you're a thoughtful person, and I'm sure you'll never do that, but maybe you hit a private residence or as you said before, you slashed a bamboo punch...\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026what's the difference between the two?\"\"Face hits have extra points.\"Jo-Gol nodded as if to admit it. Chung-Myung shook his hand at Ho Gong.\"Hey, I'm not a kid.\"\"Oh, no. Yes, Chung-Myung! I believed in this death penalty. No matter how crazy you are, you wouldn't hit a private residence.\"\"I didn't hit you.\"\"Yes!\"\"I beat him up like a dog.\"\"Yes, like a dog. Baek Cheon's private life is supposed to be like a dog.\"\u2026. What?\"Yoon-jong's face shook like an earthquake. It's like a stunt to watch.\"Hit?\"\"Yes.\"\"Who, private residence?\"\"No, you're kidding me.\"\"Don't tell me I'm joking...\u2026.\"At that moment, Yoon-jong rushed to Chung-Myung, grabbed him by the collar, and waved him.\"Hey, you crazy man! You have to do something crazy! What if I beat you up? I don't know what a sin the annihilation of knights is.\u2026.\"\"Oh, my God!\"Chung-Myung kicked Yoon-Jeong out.Having so lightly removed the metabolism, he caressed his neck and frowned.\"Who the f*ck knows? I handled it well so don't worry. Don't you know me?\"\"\u2026\u2026I do this on my own. On my own.\"Yoon-jong lamented deeply.\"Oh, my God, it's oil when you're out of your mind. How can you kill a private residence? There's a law that a person should at least abide by.\"\"\u2026\u2026when did he keep such a thing?\"\"Yes.\"The truth that Jo-Gol blurted out was lamented by Yoon-Jong's lost face. I'm about to cry thinking about what will happen in the morning.\"What's wrong with the atmosphere? You don't think I can handle that?\"\"\u2026\u2026so what did they say about the private residence?\"\"He asked you to make him stronger.\"\"Huh?\"To the unexpected answer, Yoon-jong and Jo-Gol look at Chung-Myung with their eyes wide open at the same time.In fact, Chung-Myung spoke softly, digging his ears out.\"What the heck.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The two look at each other and exchange views.Does that make sense?'No, if you think about it, it doesn't make any sense. We did, didn't we?'But it's a private residence.''We're on death row, aren't we?'The widower knows how the widower feels, and they have been similarly beaten, so I could understand how Baek Cheon brought it up.\"Well, what did you say? Did you say you'd do it?\"\"No, I just beat him up.\"\"\u2026\u2026defeat?\"\"Yes.\"\"Why?\"Chung-Myung shrugs.\"Is there a reason? I just didn't feel so good. I beat him until he got better.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"This moment - jong yoon myung chung, before training hard not to die for he regretted what he did. If I had a chance to go back to the past, I was confident that I would train without sleeping until the moment Chung-Myung came.That way, I'll be able to punch that crazy guy in the face.It was Yoon-jong who realized that there was nothing to stop a strong man if he went out of his mind.\"Don't worry about nothing, just go to bed. You'll see when you wake up.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Sleep.\"Chung-Myung trudged upstairs and the remaining Jo-Gol and Yoon-Jeong sighed deeply.\"\u2026\u2026Did he really beat him up?\"\"There's one thing I realized about Chung-Myung.\"\"What's that?\"\"He talks nonsense, but he doesn't lie.\"\"\u2026\u2026I knew it was good.\"A very good one. You punk.\"But the death penalty.\"\"Huh?\"\"Then doesn't that mean that even Baek Cheon's private residence was attacked by Chung-Myung?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Is this real?\"\"You said you'd tell a lie, even if you did.\"\"No, that's incredible. But Baek Cheon is executed.\"\"It's Chung-Myung.\"\"\u2026\u2026I'm convinced.\"Yoon-jong shook his head and looked upstairs at Chung-Myung.That monster now eats a white porcelain belly.Where is wasan going.

Don't you think what Chung-Myung said is true?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yoon-jong nodded in spite of Jo-Gol's insinuation.But is this really acceptable?Now that you have a problem with private residence, is it a mindset that can exist in the middle of the country?'Even if it's the West Station where the common sense of the midfield doesn't work, wouldn't it be like a Confucian scholar to turn his eyes upside down and fix his manners?The problem is that the crazy solution actually works.Where does the future of Hawasan go?'Yoon-jong has never thought of himself as an old man, but when I look at Chung-Myung, I think that an old man is not so bad.Wouldn't it be a more beautiful world for an old man to set up than a guy like that?\"What are you thinking?\"\"\u2026\u2026I was thinking about the future of Hwasan and the old man.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jo-Gol\"Are you getting used to it?\"'Recognizing that he was looking at himself with his eyes, Yoon-jong coughed softly.The three great disciples, who were reading the room next to him, creep up on Yoon-jong and talk to him.\"Today's private homes are a little strange, death penalty.\"\"\u2026\u2026I guess so.\"\"What's wrong with him all of a sudden? I'm afraid there might be another trick.\"\"You're right.\"Yoon-jong looked at the distant sky.'These things are out of their minds now.'I can't believe you used the word \"manipulation\" on a private residence.

Of course, this is not necessarily a bad change.\u2026 I honestly feel that I don't want to open my eyes and see the future wasan that Chung-Myung will create.\"Did Chung-Myung really beat Baek Cheon?\"\"Yoon-jong frowned as Jo-Gol spoke quietly to others.\"What are you talking about?

In particular, Chung-Myung doesn't show any remorse. Isn't it right to punish him now?\"Bee?You do?\"Like you?\"\"Yes?\"\"No, it's nothing.\"Baek Cheon forced the corners of his mouth up.There's no place in the whole body that doesn't hurt.His eyes turned to Chung-Myung, who ran away from Yoo-Esul.\"Poisonous son of a b*tc*.\"How can you mince a person so well that he doesn't leave a scar on the outside? The more I think about it, the more ridiculous he was.Thanks to this, I was able to avoid being humiliated in front of others, but there was no place to complain about this injustice. If you complain of being beaten by a scoundrel without a scratch, you'll be treated like a madman.Or be treated like a nerd who never existed again.Of course, even if there is a wound, I don't want to say that I was beaten like a dog while fighting against a predisposition. But I'm still sad that I can't do it.\"Why are you suddenly telling me not to touch the three great disciples?\"\"Baek Sang\u110b\u1161.\"\"Yes, death penalty. I don't know what it means.\"It means freezing to death.It's because I don't want to get hit.But I couldn't say what was on my mind. Baek Cheon also has social dignity.\"Hwajong branch is just around the corner.\"\"\u2026\u2026that's right.Baek Cheon said with a grim look on his face.\"I was thoughtless. It is always possible to rule the three great disciples. But Hwajong Branch is not like that. Isn't Hwajong Branch an annual event?\"Baek Sang nods his head silently.Baek Cheon, who confirmed that there was still dissatisfaction with his expression, narrowed his brows slightly.\"It is internal work to rule the three great disciples, and Hwajong Branch is external work related to the honor of Hawasan. The inside is important, but the outside is also important. Furthermore, considering the symbolism of the Hwajong Branch, everything should be put aside and put everything should be put on the Hwajong Branch. Don't you think so?\"\"\u2026\u2026right.\"\"Now our enemy is Jongnam, not the three great disciples. Don't you forget why we were training in closing?\"Baek Sang sighed deeply and bowed his head.\"The death penalty is right.

Baek Sang\u110b\u1175\"No, you started it in the first place, why are you only pretending to be nice now?'If I had questioned it, I would have been hard to answer.\"Thank you for your understanding. Let's put off the work of the three great disciples for a while. First of all, we must make every effort to hold the Hwajong Branch. Ask the priests to inspect their martial arts for the last time and reflect on what they got from the juncture.\"\"Yes, death penalty!\"Baek Sang answered bravely and ran to the back.Looking at that, Baek Cheon lowered his eyes with a slightly empty face.\"When the Hwajong Branch is over, you won't remember the manners of the three great disciples.\"'Because you'll see a ridiculous sight.Baek Cheon turned his head and looked far away at Chung-Myung.And we're not the only ones surprised.'Perhaps Jong-nam will be surprised more than Hawasan is surprised. When I thought about it, I felt like the pain where I was beaten by Chung-Myung was going away a little...Not that.It hurts more.It hurts to the bone.d*mn it, that's a good beating.Baek Cheon sighed deeply and turned away.\"I do what I have to do.\"Although something was twisted by Chung-Myung's sudden appearance, his purpose for two years has been to prove himself at the Hwajong Branch. Considering who will come to Hawaii this time, I don't have time for this.This time I will surely prove his worth.But...Baek Cheon turned back, distorting his face.\"But why does he keep hanging out with her?\"I mean, it's offensive.Baek Cheon, who was glancing at the two, headed to the training center, suppressing a slightly uneasy feeling.The time was approaching for the Hwajong Branch to begin.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From the perspective of Hyun Jong and Unam, Chung-Myung is like a benefactor who broke a heavy stone in his stomach.It is not just a matter of subsistence.It is Hawasan, a long-standing literary tradition. At least it should look plausible to others. Although it is taught that appearance is nothing but an empty courtesy, one evaluates one's opponent by what one sees.In a crappy way, people don't listen to it.Chung-Myung not only solved Hwasan's livelihood problem, but also regained his face. So how can you spare no expense?Perhaps the smiling eyes of Unam were slightly embarrassing, Hyun Jong coughed low and recommended tea to him.\"Drink it.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"Unam, who took a light sip of the tea cup, nods his head still.\"How do you like it?\"\"I think it's gotten darker. It's been dried for a long time, so it's understandable that the scent is a little lighter.\"\"Right.\"Hyun Jong nodded willingly.\"Well-dried plum leaves tend to become more fragrant. I realized it after decades of drying plum blossoms.\"Hyun Jong looked at the teacup and opened his mouth.\"The same goes for Hawasan. I was just hanging in there. He said he would reproduce past movies, but in fact, it was just too much to endure each day.\"\"\u2026\u2026long man.\"Hyun Jong, who heard Unam's voice mixed with a slight concern, smiles as if not to worry.\"But I've been hanging in there, and this day has come. Sometimes just waiting is the answer rather than any ploy or trick.\"It was a word of strange vertigo.Unam looks at Hyunjong with new eyes.'We're not the only ones moving forward.'Sometimes a long writer gets the illusion that it's already done. But a man goes on until the day he dies. Hyun Jong, who walks on the path of a Taoist, will never stop sharpening himself until the day he loses his breath.How can you not be trusted?\"Hwasan will regain his past films in the age of a long-time writer.\"\"I'd like that, but if it does, it's not my credit. It's just because of the students' efforts.\"\"How can you say it's not the work of a long writer?\"\"Unam.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"I'm the one who knows what I'm lacking. How could I have been a long writer if Hawasan had not collapsed like this? If my executions hadn't left Hwasan, I'd just spend my time memorizing books.\"Unam replied in a serious tone.\"They proved themselves ineligible for a long letter by leaving Hawasan. The long-winded man is a decent Hawasan'Hwasan.\"Hyun Jong grinned without answering.It's a bit of a embarrassing story. So we need to reverse the conversation.\"So what did you think of his students?\"\"Now I've finished training and I'm stabilizing my mind and body.\"Unam's face became slightly darker when the word \"daedae\" came out.\"The Long Man.\"\"Say it.\"\"Honestly, I'm a little scared.\"\"I'm scared...\" Why was that happen?Unam sighed low and continued.\"As I've said before, the momentum is as good as it could be. But isn't it possible to lose momentum depending on the outcome of this Hwajong branch meeting?\"\"Do you think these great disciples can't afford Jongnam's disciples?\"\"I want to trust my children, too. But... as you know...\u2026.\"Unam did not bother to gossip.He knows that the difference between wasan and Jongnam is incomparable, and Hyun Jong knows.Hawasan is just barely making it through the deepest dark ages in history, but Jongnam is facing an unprecedented heyday. Naturally, there is also a big difference at the level of his students.No matter how hard the students tried, it is a long way off to beat the disciples of Jongnam.Unam was worried that his disciples, who had just begun to have hope, would be captivated by the sense of defeat again.\"What about the three great disciples?\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes?\"\"Don't the three great disciples also participate in the Hwajong Branch? Are the children getting ready for bed?\"It was slightly curious Unam when Hyun Jong suddenly changed the subject, but Jang Moon-in has no choice but to answer the question.\"I think you're being over-steady.\"It's too much.It's too much.It was Unam that I had seen the three great disciples train several times on the way, so I had no choice but to express it like this.The children's training was entirely left to Ungum, so they could not interfere, but Unam seemed to be an unusual training method.\"They've just been introduced...\u2026.\"Hyun Jong nods his head still.Hyun Jong fully understood the concerns of Woonam.\"Unam.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"\"What if there's a mountain in front of you?\"\"It's him\u2026\u2026.\"Unam was not able to speak easily.\"Yes, we have no choice but to move on. If there is a way, I will go back, if there is time, I will take a rest, but if there is no both, I have no choice but to go over it.\"\"I'm afraid I won't make it.\"\"But you'll still get the experience. Wouldn't it be easier to cross the mountain next time?\"Unam let out a deep sigh.Not all the words of the long writer are convincing, but there is nothing more to ask. There's no way that there's a special way just because you're a long writer.When Unam's expression didn't unfold, Hyun Jong smiled and said.\"The Hwajong Branch is basically a venue for exchanges.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes.\"\"It doesn't matter if you win or lose. Isn't it important who can develop further just by using exchanges?\"\"The man of letters is right.\"\"These are guests from far away. Make every effort not to neglect it.\"\"I'll keep that in mind.\"Unam was deeply surrounded.\"The Great Hwang at the top of the galaxy has agreed to help, so there will be no problem.\"\"Dear Hwang...\u2026. Yes, I'd like to see him.\"\"Isn't the writer so busy? I'm sure Dae-in Hwang understand.\"\"Well, I'd appreciate it if you could.\"Since that day, Hwang Dae-in and the top of the galaxy have literally been pouring gold into Hawasan. Looking at the scale of the investment, it is doubtful that the harmony is intended to be made into Jay's Hangzhou or Soju.\"Wouldn't you fall for this in Jongnam?\"\"Everything will go accordingly.\"It was a calm horse as usual.Unam bowed his head deeply and crept up from his seat.\"Well, I'm going to do a final check.\"\"You've been through a lot.\"\"Don't mention it. Of course.\"Unam recedes in a backstep.As he quietly closed the door and went outside, Hyun Jong lowered his eyes and looked at the teacup placed in front of Unam.A teacup that smokes seaweed without emptying the half seems to tell you how Unam feels now.\"It doesn't matter...\u2026.\"Hyun Jong got a small brain attack.\"When you become a master, you tell lies casually.\"Hyun Jong also knew that the game was more important than anything else. However, the Hwajong branch is an unwinnable match. And you have to push your students into that unwinnable match.You can't win without a miracle happening.Without a miracle...\u2026.Hyun Jong suppressed his heavy heart and closed his eyes still.* * *\"It's still a small place.\"Jongnam's disciples, who looked around the chord, put a subtle sneer in their mouths.I've already been here two years ago, but harmony was a really small city. Compared to the West Bank, where they usually go, it is no better than the countryside.\"Did he really used to be an old file room?\"\"Of course.\"\"But isn't it too small and shabby for the old doorbell to be located?\"Jin Geum Ryong said with a grin.\"Upside down, there's Hawasan here, and it's a town this big. In the past, Hawasan was strong enough to develop a village where people who came and went to Hawasan.\"\"Let's see.\"Jong Seo-han nodded as if he finally understood.\"But isn't it now completely destroyed?\"\"He's right, too.\"Jin Geum Ryong nodded still.Jong Seo-han looked around and opened his mouth.\"I honestly don't know why we're doing this meaningless event. What's the point of sharing a sword with a predictable Hawaiian? I'd rather swing my sword one more time.\"\"This is what adults in the private sector do because they have ideas. Watch your mouth.\"\"Even so...\u2026.\"Jong Seo-han slipped his head back.Jong Seo-han, who identified a person following him in the back, puts a subtle smile in his mouth.\"Hey, this Jonghwa branch is meaningful. It's worthwhile to take revenge for those who have been humiliated.\"It was a slightly provocative remark.But Isong Baek, the provocateur, walked silently without answering.'Not funny.'Jong Seo-han narrowed the gap between his eyes.Thanks to Chung-Myung's solution to the Hwang Dae-in case, the fact that the galaxy's top team made a deal with Hawasan instead of Jongnam has become a thing that everyone knows in Jongnam.Of course, the gaze of Isong Baek, who beat Chung-Myung in front of the small group owner at the top of the galaxy and gave him the excuse, cannot be good.No reaction, no teasing.Since then, Isong Baek has changed his mind. It used to be quite serious, but now it's more than serious and silent.\"It's been a hundred years since I've been humiliated by Hwasan, so I'll pay you back, Ambassador.\"\"That will be the case.\"While Jin Geum Ryong and Jong Seo-han were walking together, Isong Baek walked without getting involved in the conversation.His eyes cross the chord and turn to the towering Hawasan.\"Is it Hwasan?When he visited here in the past, he was also very lighthearted. But now, one shadow is bound to overlap in Hawasan.'Maybe we're going into the cave now.'Isong Baek's eyes seemed to show the smiling face of Chung-Myung.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This rough mountain looked like I'd even drop a bird.\"I don't know what the hell you're thinking of building a conduit in a place like this. This is why we're doomed.\"It was the sound of clapping if Chung-Myung heard it.But Jin Geum Ryong didn't seem to think so.\"Isn't a conduit meaningful in leaving the world and becoming more like nature? It is natural to choose a place where it is not easy for foreigners to enter in and out of studying Tokyo and sharpening themselves.\"\"What conduit is Hwasan? I'm half a housekeeper. I'll at least understand if a shaman is in a place like this.\"\"Well, you're right.\"Before them, there was a place to rest in between, whether it was difficult for those who climbed Hawasan. Now Jongnam's disciples were sitting on one of them and resting for a while.One of the students of this university opens his mouth in a serious way.\"Where you go up after all this trouble, you have to have a taste of thinness, but you have to eat grass roots again and sleep in a falling hall.\"\"I don't want good food, so I hope you can sleep comfortably. I didn't sleep a wink last time because I was afraid I'd fall apart.\"\"Even open beggars wouldn't sleep in such places. What conduit is this place worse than a beggar's den.\"Complaints and disparagement come mixed together.\"I think we should stop this nonsense now. We're the only ones who come all the way to Hawaii. We're the only ones who let them do good things.\"Jin Geum Ryong shrugged embarrassingly.\"I know everyone has a lot of complaints, but you'd better calm down. Don't you know how your superiors feel about him?\"\"We don't understand that either. Why are you so obsessed with the ruined door?\"\"You're right.\"\"Maybe it's because of the potential.\"\"Hot potential?\"Someone snorted.\"If I had the power, I would have found my place. I mean, that's where it is, isn't it?\"\"Where is Moonpa who didn't have a heyday? Now is the important thing.\"When everyone said something disrespectful of wasan, one person opened his mouth still.\"You'd better not underestimate Hawasan too much.\"Everyone's eyes went back to one place.Isong Baek.He was opening his mouth with an expressionless face.\"You're going to be a disgrace.\"Then Jong Seo-han grins and says.\"Like the death penalty?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Isong Baek did not respond to the apparent provocation.\"Don't worry, death penalty. We're not going to do anything to keep Hwasan's spirits alive like the death penalty. We'll break the energy that the death penalty has saved.\"\"I'm saying you shouldn't let your guard down.\"\"What's the difference between being careless with the Hawasan guys?\"\"I...\"Isong Baek was about to say something and quit and sighed low. Whatever he says, it won't work.Elder Kimok Sung and Isong Baek were the most difficult to enter due to Chung-Myung's work at the top of the galaxy.In particular, the blame arrows were mainly directed at Isong Baek. Of course, how many people can blame the elder?\"Do as you please. But if you let your guard down, it will be you who pay for it.\"As soon as Jong Seo-han tried to say something with a frown, he heard a low voice.\"You're not wrong.\"Everyone's head turns to one side again.Everyone stood up when they saw a man slowly climbing the mountain.\"Sit down.\"\"Yes.\"The elder of Jongnam, Sama Seung, who led them, went through everyone once and opened his mouth.\"Did you forget what happened at the top of the galaxy?\"When the word \"top of the galaxy\" comes out, Isong Baek wince. But the other disciples answered without delay.\"I didn't forget.\"Sama Seung's eyes are squirming.\"I was humiliated by the ruined civilization. Do you know how angry the long writer was about it?\"Everyone lower their heads a little.It is not because he committed a crime, but to avoid anger that is buried in Sama Seung's voice.\"It's enough to be humiliated by Hawasan. We should not suffer such disgrace anymore. How long does Jong-nam, who is trying to rise above the world, have to engage with a third-class civilization like Hwasan? The writer is trying to put an end to his relationship with Hasan with this Jonghwa branch! I will never forgive anyone who is humiliated by a disciple of Hawasan for being careless at all.\"Jongnam's servants held their breath at the cold voice of Sama Seung.\"Captainers in battle do not leave any regrets, and lions do everything in their power to catch rabbits. This Jonghwa branch is not just meant to defeat Hwasan, but to trample on his spirit. Do you all understand?\"\"Yes, Elder!\"Still nodding, Sama Sung's sharp eyes reach Isong Baek.\"But being vigilant is different from being frightened. Don't you think so?\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes.\"\"Hmm.\"Sama Seung turned around and looked at Hawasan.\"If you're all rested, get up now. We'll have to get there before they lose their heads.\"\"Yes.\"Jongnam's disciples began to climb the mountain along with Sama Seung in unison.After climbing the mountain for a long time, Jongnam's disciples, who almost arrived in Hawasan, poured out a word each.\"Yes, it's a real mountain.\"\"\"I really won't come next time.\"\"If it's like the last time we got here, I'm sure we'll have prose by now.\"Climbing this steep cliff, you'll find prose that's all falling down. Then you arrived in Wasan. Those who visited Hawasan the other day ran vigorously up the cliff.\"Huh?\"\"What's that?\"And I was embarrassed by the unexpected sight.Apparently, two years ago, Hawasan's prose was as old as it could be. What else would you say if the door didn't function as a door?Now, however, where did the worn-out door go and the large newly built prose was welcoming them.\"Are you in the wrong place?\"'No way.'\"Where are the other members of the clan other than the Hwasan faction?\"Their eyes follow the prose up.The gate has been changed, but the signboard hanging on the prose has not been changed. However, the signboard, which was previously thought to be old and crumbling, turned into antique when it was combined with the newly built giant prose.When I saw the phrase \"Hwasanpa\" written in a brave handwriting, I felt an unknown pressure.\"No, what the...\u2026.\"Most people already know that the top of the galaxy invests in Hwasan.But it hasn't been long since the top of the galaxy happened. It is impossible to build such a plausible new front door of Hwasan in such a short time, even if it costs the top of the galaxy, not the top of the galaxy.\"This can't be happening.\"Jin Geum Ryong murmured absentmindedly.It's the world's best, isn't it the civil servant, Hwasan? Even that opening is the one who was mocked for rushing to learn from Hawasan.But what kind of money does the wasan have to make up such a nice prose?\"Quiet.\"Sama Seung sharpens low.\"You must have begged for some money somewhere. But even though prose can be changed, it doesn't go anywhere. Don't make a fuss.\"\"Yes!\"\"What doesn't suit you.\"Sama Seung walks to the prose with a slightly unpleasant expression.It was then.Squeak.A huge prose begins to open from side to side.And a man walked out slowly from inside.No footnote, Hyun Sang.When he saw Jongnam's disciples approaching the prose, he lightly overtook them.\"Thank you for coming all the way. Elder Sama. I've seen you before. I'm Hyun Sang, the elder of Hawasan.\"\"It's Sama Seung.\"The words that come short compared to the words that go.But Hyun Sang grinned without showing any offense.\"Nice to see you again. Elder Samar.\"\"Didn't the long man come out?\"Hyun Sang's eyebrows are wiggling.\"The long man is inside.\"\"But you've got a visitor from a distance, and you don't show me your face?\"Hyun Sang bit his lips slightly so that he could not be seen.Samsung is Jongnam's elder.It's an absolutely high status, but it's not a subject to come and go with the long-written man of Hawasan.It's not that Sama Seung doesn't know it, but calling out the long-winded man is openly disrespectful of Hwasan.Hyun Sang pressed down on the rising anger and opened his mouth.\"Have a banquet to welcome the disciples of Jongnam. It's not enough, but I hope you forget the hard work of the long trip and enjoy it.\"\"Hwasan seems to think it's a feast. He's eating and playing Jonghwa Branch.\"\"\u2026\u2026How can that be?\"\"Whatever. Lead the way. I need to see a long-winded man first.\"Hyun Sang sighed low.'There's no place for ignorance.'Jongnam-do tried to commit violence in the past, but it was not this bad. Maybe he's got his mind set on it.But hasn't Hyun Jong already exhorted him not to be frivolous? Hyun Sang, who pressed his anger, smiled forcibly and pointed inward.\"Let's eat.\"\"Hmm.\"Sama Seung stepped in with a bit of a rough step. Meanwhile, the newly built prose caught my eye.I guess he's been sponsored.'A blind man seems to have smashed money into Hawasan. So you've taken care of the most urgent things. The first things you see in others' eyes, such as prose and complexion.But there's nothing I can do about the internal halls...\u2026.\"What?\"Those who entered the prose unconsciously gasped.\"Well, what about the cabinet?\"\"When?\"As you enter the prose, you will notice a wide range of wooden-floored haze halls, which are clearly new.\"Ee, did you repair all this?'No, is it a new one?Have you been sent to Hawasan for a second?\"I think it's better than Jong-nam.\"The murmur of someone behind their back was representing everyone's feelings. Compared to this figure, Jongnam is shabby.Just two years ago, it was an absolute waste of previous works and already collapsed warheads, but when did this change?Sama Seung's face was distorted.When he stops walking, Hyun Sang asks with curious eyes.\"What's wrong with you?\"\"What seems to have changed a lot?\"Hyun Sang answers with a big smile.\"Good things happened.\"\"Is there anyone left to sponsor Hawasan? Don't tell me that those who claim to be famous have stolen.\"At that moment, Hyun Sang's face was filled with anger.No matter how long the writer asked me to do so.But this is an intolerable remark.\"Be careful with what you say\u2026\u2026.\"It was then.\"To f*ck you.\"The sound from the side turns everyone's eyes to one side.And after seeing the unfolding scene, Sama Seung hardened his face without realizing it.\"Well, what the hell is he doing?'A series of swarms flutter into his eyes. It seems to have been a long time since he ran, looking at the face of being soaked in luck and falling down at any moment, but he is running without falling down with his staggering legs.It's obviously a strange sight.But they weren't where Sama Seung's eyes were.Where I heard the sound of words.Next to the group, unlike others, a man with neat clothes and a calm expression is running along with the people ahead as if he were taking a walk.The little one.Sama Seung, who fixed her eyes on the child, spoke in a bleak voice.\"What did you just say?\"Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unfortunately, however, it was the time when Jong Nam's followers arrived.Chung-Myung tilted his head while looking at Sama Seung next to the three great disciples who struggled to breathe.\"What?\"He looks like he doesn't know anything. When she saw the face, she saw aging in her eyes.\"What did you just say?\"\"Oh, that's it.\"Instead of answering, Chung-Myung kicked Jo-Gol in the shin, stumbling beside him.\"Argh!\"\"Drop it! Don't you want to jump straight?\"\"I'm the death penalty, man!\"\"Oh, I forgot for a second.\"Chung-Myung scratched his head and grinned at Sama Seung.\"I guess you heard me. It's embarrassing.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Sama Seung glared at Chung-Myung with killer eyes.It's not Sama Seung who doesn't know who the words are directed at. There is no reason to be fooled by such blindfolds.\"This...\"Then someone pulled on Sama Seung's sleeve. He, who stopped trying to give a glimpse, sneaks back.Jin Geum Ryong whispered quietly.\"Elder, it's no good to have a fight with a child.\"\"Hmm.\"Sama Sung nodded in silence.No matter how angry he is, he is the elder of Jongnam. The difference in status is too great to talk to a child that size. If rumors spread that Hawasan's three great disciples and Jongnam's elder had an argument, there would be no such shame.Jin Geum Ryong takes a step forward as if he would scratch Sama Seung's itch.\"Who is the small stamp?\"\"Me? Do you know when you hear it?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jin Geum Ryong looked at Chung-Myung with blank eyes.He has never met anyone who asks back at his words in such a way. I feel like I'm opening my eyes beyond feeling bad.Huh, grinned Jin Geum Ryong, grinning and generously again.\"Isn't it possible that I know? So why don't you tell me?\"\"It's not rocket science. My name is Chung-Myung.\"\"Chung-Myung?\"Jin Geum Ryong's face, which was soft all the time, hardened.It's a familiar name.Didn't you say the name of Hwasan's disciple who humiliated Jongnam at the top of the galaxy was Chung-Myung?Jin Geum Ryong squinted and looked at Chung-Myung.You're younger than I thought.'It's ridiculous to watch.Thanks to Chung-Myung's treatment of Hwang at the top of the galaxy, the top of the galaxy almost cut off its business with Jongnam and opened a deal with Hwasan.The fact that he was taken away by Hawasan, who ruined his business with the top teenager on the island, was a disgrace to Jong-nam's point of view.So the long man was angry and the elders were not turned upside down? I can't believe that the person who gave that figure is a child who doesn't even have blood on his head yet.\"Right, Chung-Myung stamp. But I don't think Chung-Myung has learned the honor.\"Though explicitly rebuking the attitude, Chung-Myung scuffled his ears a couple of times and blew his mouth out.\"I'm sorry, but I can't hear you, so could you come closer and speak up?\"\"\u2026\u2026what did you just say?\"\"Are you deaf? Come here and tell me. Can't you hear me?\"Jin Geum Ryong's face hardens.What the hell does he believe in?'If it's true that he flew away with blood at a stroke in his absence with Isong Baek, it's never going to be that high. What do you believe and dare to stand up in front of you and talk nonsense?Without the liver coming out of the stomach.If I think about it, I want to pull out a sword right away and cut down this rude man in front of me.But this place is not Jongnam, but Hwasan. You can't just raise things. That is not the role of Jin Geum Ryong.Jin Geum Ryong gritted his teeth slightly and said softly.\"Are you not the three greatest disciples of Hawasan?\"\"That's right, isn't it?\"Hwasan and Jongnam share their distributions from the past. Then why don't you come closer to me than ask me to come and go to someone who's your own age? As long as you have the slightest sense of course.\"\"Oh, really?\"Chung-Myung smiles.\"Why don't you say that to Jong-nam's elder? I think it's more polite than Jongnam's elder to come and go to our private residence. Isn't it?\"Aghast Jin Geum Ryong hastily shut up.Obviously I tried to scold Chung-Myung, but it became like pointing out Sama Seung's fault.'I made this mistake.'No, it's not a mistake.That young man induced the conversation to flow like this. Without saying anything, Jin Geum Ryong will fall down.\"This...\"Sama Seung, who was watching the situation at that time, opened her mouth.\"The little one's mouth is out of the ordinary.\"\"Old man.\"\"Stand down.\"Jin Geum Ryong, biting his lips, glared at Chung-Myung and stepped back without saying a word.Sama Sung rolled up the corners of her mouth.\"I will not hold you responsible for this time because I am proud of you for thinking of a long man.\"\"Yes, thank you.\"\"But you'd better remember one. Your rudeness and my rudeness cannot be the same. Do you know why?\"\"\u2026\u2026Well?\"\"It's power.\"Sama Seung speaks in a low voice.\"It is only when someone makes a point that rudeness becomes impolite. If no one points it out, it's just passing. And the power to point out comes from power. Your rudeness without power is rudeness, but mine with power is not.\"Chung-Myung frowned on his face.\"I think you should learn how to speak more easily before being polite.\"\"\u2026\u2026you're just a nut job.\"Samsung turned around and bowed slightly toward Hyun Sang.\"I apologize for the rudeness I had earlier.\"\"Oh, no. Elder, what's wrong?\"\"Now that he's pointed out my manners, isn't that rude? That's why I apologize.\"Hyun Sang doesn't know what to do.The person who made the mistake apologizes, but the person who receives the apology is more uncomfortable.Sama Seung, who smiled at the sight, looked back at Chung-Myung and said.\"Young courage is easy to forgive. But the courage will strike you in the neck one day. Remember what I said.\"At the end of that, Samsung turned around.\"Let's go.\"\"Yes, Elder.\"Guided by Hyun Sang, he led his disciples and began walking again.Meanwhile, Isong Baek lowered his head slightly toward Chung-Myung.When Chung-Myung greeted with a short nod, he smiled lightly and soon moved away.As Jong-nam's disciples moved away, Jo-Gol opened his mouth with a white face.\"Are you crazy? What the hell are you gonna do?\"\"What?\"\"He's Jong-nam's elder! Jong-nam! Jong-nam!\"\"Era!\"Chung-Myung kicked Jo-Gol back in the shin. It's the place I kicked in earlier. Jo-Gol rolls around the floor with his shin in his hand.\"Argh!\"\"Hwasan's disciples, huh? What kind of big-time jerk insults a long-winded man?\"\"Would we put up with it?\"Yoon-jong stepped forward with a stiff face.\"I'm angry, but the author is right. A man without power does not deserve to point out the opponent's rudeness.\"\"Who says you're powerless?\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"Chung-Myung turned his head and looked at Jongnam's disciples who were moving away.\"How dare they.\"It's annoying that thieves walked into Hawasan on their own, but how dare you insult the long man?No matter how long Chung-Myung has a field hand, he can't be a real long hand.However, even so, Hyun Jong is the representative of Hwasan. So it doesn't change that Chung-Myung is the one to protect.Insulting a long writer means insulting Hawasan.Chung-Myung's eyes began to glow.\"I tried to make it better. These bastards are turning the sauce upside down. Oh, that's how it came out, right?\"\"\u2026\u2026No, let's calm down.\u2026.\"\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161. Please. Please let's think first and move on.\"The three great disciples panicked and seized Chung-Myung. They know best that once his eyes are turned, he doesn't know what he's gonna do.Then Chung-Myung turned his head away.\"Didn't you see the death penalty?\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"\"What they're doing. There's an oil content to ignore Hawasan. Are you going to put up with that?\"\"\u2026\u2026no, we don't want to put up with it. But how do you...\u2026.\"\"Listen, death row.\"Naturalization burns in Chung-Myung's eyes.\"If you lose to them, you're dead.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The faces of the three great disciples, including Yoon-jong, rotted in unison.Chung-Myung's eyes glistened with anger.\"You can lose everything else. No matter where you go, I'll do it for you. But I'll never lose to Jong-nam! The person who made me look ugly should really be prepared. The day will come when he himself sheds tears of blood in other people's eyes!\"That's not what you use to say, man!You're supposed to write it the other way around!You're making our eyes bleed.\"Why aren't you answering me?\"Chung-Myung licks his lips with his crazy eyes. Watching it makes my spine cool.\"Oh, no, we'd love to. But you're...\u2026.\"\"What, confidence?\"Chung-Myung approaches the three great disciples with glaring eyes.\"Are you not confident that you will win?\"\"Well, more than that...\u2026.\"\"Are you sure you're ready to die?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Let's lose. Let's see. That's good. We're all going to die together. You die. I die.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hwajong Branch.Event to build friendship between Hawasan and Jongnam.But the Hwajong branch was now bloodstained in front of one's anger.\"That little boy...\u2026.\"Jong Seo-han glanced back. Jin Geum Ryong walked to him and asked quietly.\"Did it bother you?\"Then, Jong Seo-han whispered quietly so that he could not hear Hyun Sang who was ahead.\"It's not that I care, it's because it's ridiculous. I don't know any subject.\"\"Leave it alone.\"Jin Geum Ryong spoke in a stiff voice.\"It is the prerogative of the weak to run amok without knowing the subject. Only a colt who doesn't know how high the sky can be.\"\"That's true, but...\u2026.\"\"There is nothing to be desired. Of course, he'll be at the Hwajong branch because he's been so self-indulgent. There's still a chance of punishing him.\"\"I want to see if you can talk to me like that even if I tear your mouth apart.\"Jin Geum Ryong grinned.\"That's not what a politician would say.\"\"That's where we started the fight.\"\"Yes, it is.\"Jin Geum Ryong didn't have to point that out, although this is exactly where the fight started.\"It's none of your business.\"At that time, Sama Seung, who sent Hyun Sang first, spoke low.\"In the end, a warrior speaks with a sword. No matter how much you babble with your muzzle, nothing will change.\"\"Yes, Elder.\"\"Power is not everything to be strong. But a place where you can't do anything without power is also a strong lake. You must not forget this fact.\"\"I'll keep that in mind.\"Sama Seung squinted her eyes.\"This Jonghwa branch is going to be a lot of fun. There must be something they believe in when they see it coming out so carefree. Thoroughly trample on the corner of that belief. Do you understand?\"\"Yes, Elder.\"Sama Seung smiled and nodded.'He's a very funny guy.'Still, there is a commendable aspect to it. Even the Elder of Hawasan can't speak out of fear, and if that young man steps forward fearlessly...\u2026.Sama Seung stopped there, planned, and looked back.His disciples, who were following him, stop in unison in surprise.\"Elder man?\"\"What's wrong with you?\"Sama Seung, who was staring back with scary eyes, soon unwinds her expression and shakes her head.\"No, it's not. Nothing.\"Then he shook his hand lightly and turned around again.But his face was severely hardened.Chung-Myung obviously pointed out Samsung's fault. That he was rude to a long writer.So you heard what I was saying on that street?'On a street where even Samsung didn't know Chung-Myung existed?'No, I don't think so.There must have been some mistake.'I guess I'm nervous. I can't believe I'm having all these ridiculous thoughts.'Smiling low, Sama Seung hurried along.But his steps were a little heavier than before.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jongnam's long-term writer evaluated Hyun Jong as a person who would have been better than anyone else if it had not been for these days.It's an over-evaluation.'Hyun Jong is a person who has never shown excellence. If you put your family before you, there's no one who can't get a good evaluation. One's excellence is not character, but achievement.Sama Seung turned her head and looked around.On the left and right sides of Hyunjong, there are Mugakju, Jaegyeonggakju, and Sage boats, as well as Unam and Ungum.All the key figures of Hawasan gathered to greet him. It's not the first time I've seen this sight, but...\u2026.'Certainly.'It feels a little different from before.All the people I saw in the previous Jonghwa Branch were stuck in life, and somehow suppressed.However, there is no suppression in these people, and there is a subtle sense of relaxation.I don't like it.'Sama Seung's eyes narrowed slightly.It doesn't matter what the source of this confidence is. Whether it's money, ignorance or just groundless bravado, Hawasan can't have anything beyond the end of the world.SAMA SUNG just disapproved of the fact that Hwasan's superiors were confident.\"I don't know if you like the car.\"When Hyun Jong hinted, Sama Seung nodded lightly.\"The scent is deep.\"\"I'm glad you like it.\"Sama Seung smiled broadly.\"It's true that the scent is strong, but I don't really enjoy plum blossoms in the first place.\"Hyun Jong's eyes slightly wiggled.However, she opened her mouth with a soft voice as if she had regained her composure.\"Is there a reason?\"\"There are many different scents in the forest. The smell of soil, the smell of trees, and the smell of dew. However, where plum blossoms are in full bloom, there is only the scent of plum blossoms. It's so thick that it covers all the scents around it.\"Just as was the case with Hawasan in the past.\"The world is a place where we live in harmony. Therefore, I rather enjoy the subtle scent of yeotcha than the plum blossom scent that breaks the harmony.\"The wise men remained calm, but the ships could not hide their hot faces. It is no different from openly arguing about the difference in authority.But wise men took Sama Seung's words a little differently.'Does it mean that Hawasan in the past, who pursued the mob, refused to harmonize?'To bring that up at this moment would mean Jong-nam still hasn't forgotten his past grudge.It is not something an elder dares to say in front of a literary man of a literary faction. But no one here could point out Sama Seung's words.As Samsung said, courtesy depends on the will of the guardian. The moment you don't get disrespectful, politeness is just a sham.Sama Seung, who brought the atmosphere to his liking with a few words, smiled and opened his mouth.\"The Long Man.\"\"Say it.\"\"We in Jongnam have no intention of continuing this event after this Jonghwa branch.\"Hyun Jong narrowed his forehead.\"May I ask why?\"\"Simple.\"Sama Sung rolled up the corners of her mouth.\"Because my absence with Hawasan does nothing to help Jongnam develop. Isn't the gap already too wide?\"Hyunjong closed his eyes slightly.It's a disgraceful thing to say with your eyes and ears. Even the elders sitting on his left and right showed signs of anger.'The interest...'Hyun Young's beard trembled.This is literally nothing short of a dog's dinner. How can you say such a thing in front of a man of letters?At that time, Hyun Jong, who was still closing his eyes, slowly opened his eyes.\"The Hwajong Branch is not just a ceremony to share the burden. In the first place, Hwajong Branch is for the friendship between Hwasan and Jongnam.\u2026.\"\"It's frustrating, isn't it?\"Sama Seung cut off Hyun Jong's words.\"This...\"As soon as Hyun Young is about to have a seizure, Hyun Sang presses Hyun Young's knee. It means don't be frivolous.Hyun Young, who looked at Hyun Sang and Jang Moon-in alternately, bit his lower lip.Isn't that too much?'Who doesn't know that Hawasan and Jongnam of Tanggeum are incomparable? Even Hawasan's people are painstakingly aware of that fact.But even so, Hawasan is a literary group that boasts history and tradition. Although it is not now, it was proudly listed in the Old File Room until a hundred years ago, and it was once the place that sought to inspect the world first.It is not polite to behave like this to the face, even if it is a long story of a third-class civilization without a door, not a Hawaiian. It's impossible that Sama Seung doesn't know that, but he'Sama Seung looks at Hyun Young and smiles fishyly.Knowing the meaning of the smile, Hyun Young had no choice but to grasp his thigh and endure it.Kang-ho is heartless.Those who have no power have no choice but to endure it.Sama Seung, who looked through the people gathered in the room, continued to speak low.\"Jongnam and Hwasan have never been on good terms. No, to be honest, wouldn't it be right to say that I'm more of an enemy? I'm sure the people here want to chew me up.\"\"\u2026\u2026it's not that bad.\"\"If so, does anyone have a good feeling about me? No, does anyone have a good feeling about Jongnam?\"No one answered.It is not difficult to answer that. But who doesn't know it's a lie? They know and Sama Seung knows.\"There's nothing more futile than trying to reconnect the thread that's already broken.\"Sama Seung's voice was firm.Everything has already been decided, as if it were just a notification.The fact that the elder of Han Mun-pa makes such a determination means that the story is already over with Jang Mun-in. So this is not the meaning of Sama Seung, but the meaning of Jong Nam as a whole.Furthermore, Jong-nam is now officially saying that he will put Hwasan at their feet. It's a declaration that they won't regard Hawasan as their competitor in the future.It's a disgrace.It's so humiliating.When no one had the heart to open their mouth, Unam slipped away.\"Isn't that too sudden?\"\"That's what we should have done already.\"\"Old man.\"When Unam doesn't back down, Sama Seung looks down on him.\"So you think Hawasan deserves to be Jongnam's opponent?\"Unam shut up. I cannot answer this question.Sama Seung smiles quietly and continues to talk.\"I think Jong-nam has done everything he can by treating him so far.\"\"What do you mean treat? You're talking a little too much to say.As Unam raises his voice, Sama Seung smiles fishyly.\"What are you saying is too much?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Jongnam has consistently helped Hwasan forget his past grudges. In fact, isn't it unfair that Jonghwa Branch continues to be held in Hawasan? Nevertheless, Jongnam has not even provided certain wealth to Hwasan whenever Jonghwa Branch is held. And you're still blaming Jong-nam?\"I don't think so.Unam grinds his teeth.It is obvious why the Hwajong Branch was held only in Hwasan.It was to laugh at Hawasan, who came and fell, and to show all of his Mundo that Jongnam had won by rain.And the wealth that was given in the name of support was just food that prevented Hwasan from refusing to serve as a peacemaker.\"The Long Man.\"Sama Seung pressed the words of others and opened her mouth firmly.\"If you don't understand, I'll let you understand. If you look at the results of this Jonghwa Branch, you will say that we will not open it again in Hasan. Think carefully if you don't want to spoil the kids.\"Sama Seung got up from her seat. Then, he strode along as if he was leaving the room even though the guest spirit had not fallen.When everyone is embarrassed and at a loss, Hyun Jong asks Sama Seung's back.\"Is Jongnam walking on the pavement?\"Sama Sung stops walking. Then I turned my head and looked at Hyun Jong.There was no expression on Hyun Jong's face, so I couldn't figure out what he meant.\"That's not for me to decide.\"Before long, Sama Seung opened the door and went outside.The faces of those left behind are filled with grief.\"How can you do anything?\"Hyun Young can't hold back his anger and hits the attic. The attic cracks and tea pours down to the floor. But no one thought of blaming Hyun Young for that.The sword opens its mouth heavily.\"Every time there was a Hwajong branch, they were always in a bad mood, but this is the first time it's been this bad.\"\"That's right, that's over the top!\"\"How can an elder be in the presence of a man of letters?\"\"Don't you have to protest directly to the end of the country?\"Everyone couldn't resist their anger and added a word.However, only Hyun Jong shook his head with a sad face among them.\"...leave it alone.\"\"One long man!\"Words are sometimes vain. No matter what we say, it doesn't matter.\"Unam lowered his head. Others, too, bowed their faces contorted with anger.Hyun Jong said.\"I can live with humiliation. Even if I spit in my face, I can laugh casually. That's not what I'm worried about now.\"\"What if\u2026\u2026?\"I'm worried about the kids.\"\"Oh....\"Unam's eyes trembled.\"Seeing you speak directly to me, the presence of this Hwajong Branch will be no more daunting. I can endure as much as I want to be hurt and insulted, but what should I do about the pain that children will suffer?\"Hyun Jong's face is filled with grief. The burden of being a long-time writer of a weak literary group is too heavy.\"Then even now...\u2026.\"Unam closed his mouth while talking.Originally, what he wanted to say was, \"Why don't we stop the Hwajong branch now?\" But before I could finish speaking, I realized what a lost word it was.It is more disgraceful than death that a warrior gives up the game because he is afraid of his opponent.What's more, aren't those who work in the same boat distribute the same? If one surrenders without even fighting the same distribution, the stigma will haunt his disciples for life.\"My sins are too great.\"Hyun Jong lets out a deep sigh. Others, too, could not find words to comfort Hyun Jong, but kept silent.Then Ungum, who was listening to the conversation, opened his mouth.\"Long-lived. It's not the only thing to think about.\"Hyun Jong's eyes turned to Ungum.\"They're going to show a clear gap with Hawasan and spread the word that he's no longer worthy of fame throughout the island. It will be a decisive blow to the main faction, which has already fallen to the point. Maybe that's what they're after, isn't it?\"\"I guess so, but is there any other trick?\"\"Not a trick. If you don't let him get away with it, that's all.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"The Long Man.\"Looking at Hyun Jong, who lost what to say to the ridiculous answer, the crybaby slightly rolled up the corners of his mouth.\"Trust your children. Maybe there's some good news.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Woon-gum grinned as he received everyone's suspicious eyes.Now it's your turn to prove it.

Nevertheless, the fact that the gap has narrowed has offended Jin Geum Ryong.Jong Seo-han sneaks a glance at him and laughs awkwardly.Usually Jin Geum Ryong is a very gentle person. However, if he is judged to be a gentle person, he will surely suffer a setback.Jin Geum Ryong, whom Jong Seo-han knows, is like the sea.The sea normally quietly embraces everyone, but when it gets angry, it becomes a violent riot and devours everything. Jin Geum Ryong was exactly like that. He is usually softer than anyone else in Jongnam when he is angry.Jong Seo-han smiled awkwardly and opened his mouth.\"It's true that Hawasan is quite arrogant, Ambassador.\"\"Well.\"\"But at the end of the day, it's Muhak, isn't it? Even if you dress up nicely, even if you wear silk clothes and eat good things, if Muhak can't support you, it's a bright dog apricot.\"\"You're right.\"Jin Geum Ryong slowly rose from his seat.Then he looked back at the collective death penalty.\"One!\"Jin Geum Ryong speaks in a loud voice.\"All I want is a perfect win!\"Everyone is holding their breath.\"Fame, wealth, Muhak, a perfect landslide victory without any comparison. Otherwise, there is no point. If there is any comparison with the already fallen Hawasan, it is a disgrace to Jongnam. We shouldn't just be stuck in a place like this. Did you forget? Our generation must make Jong Nam one of the world's most influential people.\"There was a firm resolution in the eyes of Jongnam Ewha Womans University students.\"Hold yourself together. Your relaxed mind as if you were on a trip makes me angry. Don't forget what we came here for. I will not forgive those who do not show up as Jong-nam's disciples before the Elder!\"\"I'll keep that in mind. Death penalty!\"\"I will never let my guard down.\"Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap.Then, the door opens wide.And Sama Seung claps and walks inside.\"Excellenthusiastic.\"See you, Elder!\"When everyone got up from their seats and took the lottery, Sama Seung smiled and nodded.\"The golden dragon said what I had to say.\"\"I'm ashamed. If I had known that the elder was coming, I would never have said this.\"\"No. No. It was an absolutely magnificent horse. Of course, Jongnam's disciple should have that mind.\"Sama Seung, who lowered her hand, smiled blurry.\"On top of that.\"\"Yes, Elder.\"\"We should not end this round with just winning. They should not dare to mention Jong-nam's name. Do you understand what I mean?\"Jin Geum Ryong squinted.\"What do you mean?\"\"Comparing a beaming radish. It's basic not to hurt each other. Don't you think so?\"Jin Geum Ryong, who was slightly lost in thought, smiled.\"Old man.\"\"Hmm?\"\"Hwasan's disciples are very sharp. I don't think they're what they used to be.\"\"Hmm?\"Suddenly, Sama Seung glanced at Jin Geum Ryong's weak-pitched attitude. However, his expression relaxed gently again at the following words.\"Bimu is basically not hurting each other. However, as their spirits are sharper than expected, there is a limit to going easy on them. In order not to get hurt on this side, we might break one arm and leg, is that okay?\"\"Huh, that's a big deal.\"Sama Sung puts her hand on the chin pretending to be worried.\"No, you can't. That's not the way it should be. No matter how important it is, it doesn't mean anything if our children get hurt. You guys should finish this project without getting hurt as much as possible. Diarrhea... ...\"Sama Seung smiles and continues to talk.\"Even if I hurt them.\"Jin Geum Ryong smiled and nodded as if that was enough.\"I will rule over the priests and finish them without accidents.\"\"Well, that's good.\"Samsung looked at Jin Geum Ryong with a smile.With one child like this, there is no worry in the world. Later, when Jin Geum Ryong becomes a long writer and leads, Jongnam's heyday will begin again.Of course, I still play that role.\"Golden Dragon.\"\"Yes, Elder.\"\"I'll leave my other things to you. But there's one thing I'd like to ask you.\"\"Give me your name.\"\"Never leave that cheeky fellow alone.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"A person's face came to Jin Geum Ryong's head. Perhaps the other death penalty is thinking of one person as well. There's only one person who can combine wasan and cheeky.\"You mean that Chung-Myung kid?\"\"Yes.\"Jin Geum Ryong grinned.\"Don't worry. I'll make sure the kid breaks his habit.\"\"You think a little shallow.\"\"\u2026\u2026Yes?\"Unknowingly, Jin Geum Ryong bowed his head at the thought of committing disrespect.\"The child has already made a great contribution to Hawasan at the top of the galaxy. I'm sure everyone knows.\"\"Yes.\"While everyone was answering vigorously, Isong Baek was the only one who couldn't answer and bowed his head. Isong Baek can't help getting smaller every time the story at the top of the galaxy comes out.Sama Seung gave him a short look and continued.\"I think there's a lot of faith in the child in Hasan. And yet that's the kind of personality he is. Do you understand what this means?\"\"I can't guess because my student is foolish.\"\"The world is a place where those who have the ability come up. Sometimes, however, it is also the world where the incompetent take the momentum and make ridiculous achievements. I think it could be a big setback for Jong-nam if the child grows up like this.\"Jin Geum Ryong narrowed his forehead.That much?'\"With all due respect, are you still a child?\"\"That's why.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Sama Seung growled as if.\"The child, who had barely come to terms and conditions, said everything I had to say in front of me. And what happens when he grows up?\"\"\u2026mmmmm.\"\"I guess it's one of the other. Overgrown or destroyed.\"\"Isn't it much more likely to be destroyed?\"\"I can't accept that there is a possibility that the child will grow up and raise Hwasan. That's why we need to nip it in the bud.\"\"I understood what the elder was saying.\"Jin Geum Ryong turned his head.\"Good.\"\"Yes, private residence!\"Sunwoo ran out quickly from the back.\"You've heard the Elder, haven'\"\"Of course, private residence. Don't worry. I'll destroy it thoroughly so that I won't ever make fun of that lazy muzzle again.\"\"That's not enough. Make it impossible to make a comeback again. For the rest of my life to regret against Jongnam.\"\"Yes, private residence!\"Jin Geum Ryong nodded.Seonwu-ryang is the best of Jongnam's three great disciples, called Gijang. He is not the oldest of the three great disciples, but he is the best in his ability.In particular, since his skills began to stand out after the last Jonghwa Branch, Hawasan may not even know what Seonwoo is like.It's the best hand to catch Chung-Myung.Jin Geum Ryong smiled and looked back at Sama Seung.\"Everything will be as the elder wishes. I'll make it like that.\"Sama Seung nods her head with a satisfied look.\"I believe in you.\"It's as reliable as it gets.Jong-nam raised them with all his might. It was Sama Seung, who had no doubt that all efforts so far would open Jongnam's heyday through these children.And this Jonghwa branch will be an opportunity to mark the beginning.'I'll crush you.'In Sama Seung's eyes, a cold life was young.* * *\"\u2026\u2026are you sure you're doing it?\"\"My heart is pounding.\"\"I've been there a dozen times today.\"\"Oh, shit.\"The three great disciples could not sleep until late at night.Tomorrow, the Hwajong branch will start. Until now, there was no time to think about Hwajongjihoe and Nabal because it was breathtaking just to endure training.However, taking a day off from training to preserve physical strength, all kinds of miscellaneous thoughts dominate the head.\"Can we really do this well?\"\"You said you'd be Chung-Myung.\"\"No, he's never been with a Jong-nam.\"\"But...\u2026.\"Yoon-jong sighed deeply.I know the priests are anxious, but he couldn't find anything to calm them down.'I'm so nervous right now.'My heart kept pounding.Turning his head and glancing to the side, even Jo-Gol seemed nervous. So even though it's late at night before dawn, no one can fall asleep and stay here.Yoon-jong scratched his head a couple of times and opened his mouth.\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1173\u11ab?\"\"I'm sleeping.\"\"\u2026\u2026Did he make his liver out of iron?\"Is there no such thing as nervousness? Nervous?Tomorrow is Hwajong branch. I mean, should I say today? It's past midnight.Just thinking about it makes my heart pound.\"You've been sleeping for a while.\"\"I've seen it stretching out in large numbers. He even snored.\"\"\u2026\u2026I envy you, I think you're crazy.\"I guess it'As soon as Yoon-jong was about to open his mouth, he heard a dull voice.\"It's not that I have a big liver, it's the size of a bean.\"Everyone's head turned toward the stairs in unison.Chung-Myung was coming down with a glum face.\"What are you doing here, staying up all night?\"\"Ki, I'm nervous.\"GinzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaChung-Myung's head is tilted.Here we go again. That son of a b*tc*!What else are you going to do with me?'What do you mean? If you lose again, you'll die. You son of a b*tc*!But the words from Chung-Myung's mouth slightly missed their expectations.\"Why am I so nervous?\"\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"\"Isn't nervous a person who's less prepared?\"Yoon-jong replied as a representative.\"No, it's not that, but I'm afraid I won't be able to show good performance tomorrow\u2026\u2026.\"\"Death penalty.\"\"Huh?\"\"Then is there anything else the death penalty can do if we turn the clock back ten days?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"I don't. Just thinking about it makes me sick. I can't believe I have to do this crazy thing again for ten days.\"There's no such thing as nervousness for someone who's done everything. The death penalty isn't nervous right now. You just don't believe in yourself. But that's also a funny thing. If you're weak, admit yourself to being weak. The important thing is, did you really do your best? Did you do your best with the death penalty?\"\"\u2026\u2026yes.\"I can tell you this for real. They really did their best.\"Then that's enough.\"Chung-Myung bounces his finger.\"No matter what everyone says, I'll admit that the death penalty did their best. So don't waste your time on useless things and go to bed. Sleeping enough the day before is also a skill and effort to stay fit.\"Everyone nodded.\"Then go up.\"\"\u2026\u2026where are you going?\"\"I need to train.\"\"Today is Hwajong Branch.\"\"That's a great thing. Training is about ten times more important than that.\"In conclusion, Chung-Myung opened the door and walked out.Then everyone lets out a low sigh.\"That's really\u2026\u2026\"\"They're going to train.\"Looking at Chung-Myung, who maintains his usual life until the day of the Hwajong Branch, I feel foolish about the worries he has had so far.\"Let's sleep.\"Yoon-Jong spoke low.\"Chung-Myung is right. If you want to answer confidently that you tried until the end, you have to try to sleep.\"\"Yes, death penalty.\"I got up from my seat, wondering if everyone felt the same way.One by one, Yoon-jong, who was watching the death penalty heading to his room, turned his head and looked at the door where Chung-Myung had left.'Anyway, he's a weirdo.'With those few words, I relaxed those who couldn't sleep until this dawn.No matter what the results of the Hwajong Branch are, the three great disciples will be even stronger with that Chung-Myung.Yoon-Jong was so sure.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the past, when it was called plum blossom inspection, there were people who were afraid of him, but there were no people who were afraid of him.Wasn't even Sorim's long-winded to meet him?I can't believe Chung-Myung is now in a situation where a little girl is uncomfortable.\"What do you have to say to make a deal?\"If I could think of it, I'd break my head, wrap it around a rope, and throw it off a cliff, but it's an accident, so I can't beat it.Yes?What's Baek Cheon?\"He came at me first.\"How can a quarrel and a nuisance accident be the same?Anyway, for the first time in my life...\u2026. No, it was Chung-Myung who avoided people for the first time after he died.\"How can I avoid people this early in the morning?\"It was the moment when Chung-Myung, who sighed deeply, was about to run to the mountain.'Huh?'I feel something in the air.\"Hey, hey, hey! I knew this would happen! Deceive me the ghost. Deceive me...\u2026.Huh?\"Chung-Myung tilted his head.The feeling is different from that of Yoo-Esul. Yoo-Esul boasts a fantastic sense of non-existence that feels blurred even when Chung-Myung of the world has a sense of humor.That's why Chung-Myung has missed her mark several times.But the sense I feel now is too strong and clear to belong to Yoo-Esul. And...\"Two?\"Not even one person.Chung-Myung, who slightly narrowed his forehead, began to move cautiously toward the side where he felt a sense of humor.I can't believe they're meeting each other in this deep mountain at this dawn. This smells like a conspiracy.We need to see what the trick is.'Chung-Myung's eyes began to sparkle.Clawing fluid.His feet begin to move vigorously through the wind. Chung-Myung, who almost reached the place where he felt a sense of humor, killed the gas and still assimilated himself with the surroundings.And sneak forward and slightly stick out your head.'Huh?'Chung-Myung blinked his eyes. However, no matter how many times I look at it again, the people I see in front of me have not changed.One was also familiar with Chung-Myung.Baek Cheon.It's not strange that Baek Cheon is here. Anyway, this is the territory of Hwasan.But it was strange, but so strange, to have someone on the other side of Baek Cheon here.Why are you coming out of there?'Jin Geum Ryong.Jin Geum Ryong, one of Jongnam's greatest disciples, stands at odds with Baek Cheon with a strange expression.Why are the two of them seeing each other at this hour?'Something smells like a conspiracy.Chung-Myung sneaked forward and listened.\"You seem to be doing well.\"Jin Geum Ryong smiles and talks to Baek Cheon. But the face of Baek Cheon, who was told that, was contorted with displeasure.\"You look relaxed.\"\"There's no reason for that, is there? My colleague.\"\"Pfft!\"Jin Geum Ryong and Baek Cheon's eyes turn to one side at the same time.Oh, my God.Chung-Myung held his breath desperately.The word \"co-worker\" made Chung-Myung unbearable.The two tilt their heads and face each other again. Probably thought it was the sound of an animal.Baek Cheon distorted his face.\"Don't call me by that name. I'm Baek Cheon.\"\"You don't throw away the name given by your parents. No matter what anyone says, you're a dinosaur.\"'Turn it off.Chung-Myung grabbed the floor.'Oh, my. I'm going to die. Baek Cheon's real name is Baek Cheon. My stomach is going to rip.'Chung-Myung's body cramps.Baek Cheon's face turned red as if it were about to burst.\"It's Baek Cheon!\"\"All right, colleague.\"Wow, he's feeding me right.My face turns red because I don't like it, but I keep getting co-workers in my face. You have a really bad personality.Whether he knows Chung-Myung's evaluation or not, Jin Geum Ryong continued the conversation with a slightly smiling face.\"It's not so bad to live in Hawaii, is it? You look pretty good, don't you think?\"\"What are you trying to say?\"\"I just missed you.\"Jin Geum Ryong smiles at the corners of his mouth.\"I wonder how my ugly brother, who ran away from home to beat his brother, lives in Hawaii.\"\"You've checked it out two years ago, haven'\"\"I can't get enough of kicking a defeated dog no matter how many times I kick a defeated dog.\"Baek Cheon's face is distorted.Jin Geum Ryong is that kind of person. A ruthless man who thinks he's weaker than himself. Usually, he disguises himself as gentle, but inside him is a rotten, disfigured stomach.How much have you been bullied by Jin Geum Ryong?\"How do you like it? If you still beg on your stomach, I can accept you to the end of the war.\"\"Don't say bullshit.\"Baek Cheon looks Jin Geum Ryong in the eye and says.\"I'm Baek Cheon, a student of Hawasan's class and ambassador. Now, my dream is to make Hawasan more of a clan than Jongnam. So don't ever bring that up in front of me again.\"'Oh?'Chung-Myung looked at the two with sparkling eyes.So let's see.So, basically, those two are brothers? One is a gold dragon and the other is a companion.'\u2026\u2026I really want to see who my father is.'I will avenge this torn belly muscle. What the hell were you thinking about naming them like that? That's why he ran away from home!Baek Cheon growled as if.\"And even if I were to beg, you'd laugh and say it like it never happened. Because that's who you are.\"\"Haha, it's weird being a brother. You know me so well even after living apart for so long.\"Jin Geum Ryong, who was laughing for a long time, suddenly looked at Baek Cheon with a straight face and cold eyes.\"You made the wrong choice.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"If you wanted to defeat me, you should have entered Jongnam. That way, there would have been a possibility. But not Jongnam, but wasan? You're going to beat me? Hahaha. The dog must be laughing!\"Baek Cheon bit his lips.\"Don't ignore Hwasan.\"\"Whoa?\"\"Yes, you're right. That's why I first put an enemy in Hawasan. The idea was to lead and defeat the brother who ignored me and despised him, their least favorite was Hwasan.\"\"It's a stupid idea to even call it a slap. Should I say it's like you.\"Ignoring the constant outpouring of teeth, Baek Cheon said sternly.\"At first, it was definitely a youngster. But now I really like wasan. It's worth living as Baek Cheon, a great student and ambassador of Hawasan.\"\"Whoa?\"Chung-Myung looked at Baek Cheon with proud eyes.'That's what happened.'You must be strong.There must have been a reason. In addition, Chung-Myung was subtly moved by Baek Cheon's comments.'Oh, it all falls down...\u2026.'\"You find it worth living as a great disciple of the fallen literary faction? On this ruined doorstep? Have you lost your mind?\"Is that him?No, that's what Chung-Myung was going to say, but I'm upset to hear him say it again.I'm just gonna give you a big mouth!\"Yes.\"Baek Cheon answered firmly.\"It may seem strange. But I found out when I came here. It's not happy to brag about a good door, good food, good clothes. At least this place needs me, and I could set a goal to make sure I didn't disappoint it. Hawasan is the place that gave me a goal and even covered me with affection!\"\"Affection?\"Jin Geum Ryong spoke as if he had lost his mind.\"Such soft talk, you seem to have seen less of reality. I'll tell you. You're already done. In exchange for this pathetic choice, you'll be humiliated as a third-class warrior all your life. And here you'll see me become Jongnam's long writer.\"\"What the hell is that? I just live my life.\"\"You'll end up living a shitty life. It's going to be fun to watch, though.\"Jin Geum Ryong says with a fishy smile.\"But it's not my cup of tea to watch for a long time. I'll let you know tomorrow without waiting. How stupid it was to choose Hawasan over Jongnam.\"And Jin Geum Ryong, who tilted his head as if he was contemplating something, put a sneer in his mouth.\"No, I don't. Maybe it was a good choice. What better combination of a fallen civilization and a fool?\"\"It doesn't matter if you insult me. But don't bring up Hawasan with that mouth. I'll rip your mouth off.\"\"\u2026\u2026what about you?\"Jin Geum Ryong glared at Baek Cheon. Baek Cheon recoils at the soaring livelihood.Jin Geum Ryong, who had been staring at Baek Cheon for a while, suddenly smiled after living.\"There's no rush. You'll find out when the day comes. You and Hwasan will no longer be able to face the river after tomorrow. That's exactly what I'll make you do.\"Jin Geum Ryong flicked Baek Cheon and turned around. Then I went down the mountain without looking back.Baek Cheon sighs deeply while looking at Jin Geum Ryong's back.Do you think you can make it?'Jin Geum Ryong is a man who does what he does. Aside from his personality, Baek Cheon is so talented that he can't dare follow.Baek Cheon bit his lips.Don't be shaken.I am Baek Cheon of Hawasan. And one day he's the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to bloom his films again.Baek Cheon, who was muttering to himself as if he was determined to do so, turned his body firmly.\"Wow, that's admirable.\"\"Wow, you scared me!\"Scared Baek Cheon sat down on the floor swearing unconsciously. I was so surprised that my heart almost popped out of my throat.I barely managed to pull myself together and looked up, and Chung-Myung was nodding with a pleased face.\"You, you...\" Why are you here?\"\"Friend....\" Ugh. Do, do, co-worker.\"Baek Cheon's face was distorted as Chung-Myung forced to hold back the leaking laughter.\"\u2026\u2026did you hear it all?\"\"Oh, my friend. This quality was admired. What a proud heart to think of Hwasan.\"Baek Cheon sighs as Chung-Myung nods constantly.\"You're a ghost. I didn't even notice it.\"\"Well, of course.\"\"\u2026\u2026there's nothing wrong, but don't tell anyone else. There are people who don't like it's\"\"Don't worry, private residence. This Chung-Myung! He's the last person in the world to talk.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Doesn't that mean your mouth is as big as yours?Baek Cheon wrapped his head in the thought that he was caught by this guy.I didn't know anyone about this except for a few elders, including a long writer. But of all things...\u2026.\"Hmm. So you're saying that's Jin Geum Ryong's brother?\"\"Even if I'm your younger brother, I don't think we're very friendly. In the first place, my mother is different...\u2026.\"Baek Cheon sighed and tried to connect.\"Since I was a child...\u2026.\"\"Oh, that's enough.\"\"Huh?\"\"You don't have to listen to such trivial things. It's obvious. I was born as a clerk or the youngest, so I ran away from home and came to Hawaii because I was hit by a talented older brother. Don't you?\"\"\u2026\u2026Don't shorten other people's lives so simply.\"But you're right.\"Good job.\"\"Yes, so...\u2026.Huh?\"Baek Cheon raises his head.\"Good job, come to Wasan.\"Chung-Myung looked a little different from before. It's not the smile that always scratches a person's temper. It was a really gentle smile.And a heavy voice came out of his mouth.\"No matter what your origin or story is, since you've come to Hawaii on your own, you're a disciple of Hawasan. And it proves that it was never wrong to abandon Jong-nam and choose Hawasan.\"Baek Cheon couldn't say anything.That's not what this young man would say. Strangely, however, the moment I hear it, my mind sinks in peace.\"Proof? When?\"\"When is it?\"Chung-Myung smiles.\"Today.\"Chung-Myung turned his head.Sooner or later, the sun will rise to announce the Hwajong Branch.\"Let's go for it. Private residence.\"Chung-Myung's eyes were deaf.It's time to crush those Jong-nam guys' noses.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The children who are lined up in front of him now understand how much burden they have to carry on the Hwajong branch.I have a pain in the chest.I don't know when it became this bad, but this burden was inherently a burden for the elders of the private sector, including long writers. However, from a certain point when the Hwajong Branch was established, it proved the power of the literary group and passed the honor to the children.He is too young to bear the burden even if he is a great student.Not to mention the three great disciples.Nevertheless, I am more sorry for the children who come forward without complaining about the heavy burden.\"The Long Man.\"Hyun Young peeked around and Hyun Jong slightly raised his head.I was sentimental and kept the children up too long.Hyun Jong refreshed the atmosphere with a low cough and opened his mouth with a gentle voice.\"You all look nervous.\"Hyun Jong, who slowly looked back at the children, shakes his head.\"You don't have to be so stiff. Winning or losing doesn't matter. All you have to do is use this Hwajong branch as your foundation.\"Hyun Jong makes eye contact with everyone and speaks as if he is determined.\"No matter what the consequences may be, you are still the proud disciples of Hawasan. All you have to do is remember the fact.\"It was a crude remark.Words that did not lift the spirits of those who went out to pray, nor did they make the determination to win the honor of Hawasan.However, the words eased the nervous disciples' minds under heavy burdens.Hyun Jong nodded as everyone's expression became a little gentle.\"I'll keep an eye on you. See you later.\"At the end of that, Hyun Jong turned around and walked first. Hyun Young quickly sticks to the side.\"Don't you want to go with me?\"\"No matter how hard it is, those who fight and those who watch cannot go together. They'll have something to say between themselves. Let the children be alone.\"\"Yes, a man of letters.\"When Hyun Young winked, other members of Hawasan's elders and the Unja boats quickly followed in the footsteps of Hyun Jong.One person stepped forward when the remaining two great disciples and the three great disciples were relaxing with low breathing.Baek Cheon.He stood firm in front of everyone.\"Today we fight Jong-nam.\"Baek Cheon's eyes glanced at Chung-Myung and went back to his place.\"As the long man said, losing is not a shame. Shame is not doing your best. Be proud of yourself as a disciple of Hawasan when you fight.\"\"Yes, death penalty!\"\"Let's go!\"Baek Cheon led his students to the unarmed position with a firm face. The faces of the disciples who follow suit show determination. Even Yoo-Esul's face, which was walking at the end, showed extraordinary determination.\"Hmmm.\"As the students of this university moved away, Yoon-jong sneaked out to the front.Then the three great disciples warmly welcomed Yoon-jong.\"Well, what do you want to say, Ambassador?\"\"Let's just say no, no. You're going to stay up all night.\"\"Ha, I heard that a real sentence drives a person crazy.\"You bastards....\"You guys treat me to a Baek Cheon dinner class!\"\"Okay, let's do it quickly. My legs hurt.\"\"If you're going to be like this, let's all say something. Jo-Gol death penalty. Go stand in the back in advance. Save time.\"\"Sad.\"Yoon-jong sighs deeply.'They used to be so nice.'How did you end up like this?Yoon-jong turned his head and looked at the root of all this.Chung-Myung, who is drooping with the face of being lazy to die even though a large event called Hwajong Branch is in front of him, catches his eyes.\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161.\"\"Huh?\"\"Don't you have anything to say?\"Chung-Myung smirks.\"You're doing a hell of a lot of work.\"Chung-Myung turned his head and looked at the unarmed place.\"I have to finish quickly and eat. Let's go.\"Yoon-jong unwittingly rolled up the corners of his mouth.\"Hi, dude.\"I can be sure of one, if not the other.He is usually a hell of a man, but there is no limit to being reliable at times like this.\"Let's go!\"Yoon-jong took the lead and led everyone to unarmed.Following him, Chung-Myung still glowed his eyes.* * *Hwajong Branch is basically an event created for the exchange of Hwasan and Jongnam.Of course, inwardly, Hwasan has an axe to grind, Jongnam has an axe to grind, but at least outwardly aimed at exchanges centered on bimu.Therefore, Hwajong Branch does not accept visitors separately.Until now, only Hwasan and Jongnam's Mundo gathered together and did nothing but pray to win each other.Of course, this Hwajong branch is no different.Until arriving unarmed, everyone thought so.Whispering.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Hyun Jong opened his eyes wide and looked at the smoke field.Passing through Hawasan's prose comes the great battlefield. Due to the nature of Bimura, large seats are needed. Therefore, Hwajong Branch was held here without exception.Until now, all of the disciples of Hwasan and Jongnam were lined up on the left and right sides of this wide range of smoke fields, but today there was a rather strange scene.\"What the hell are they...\u2026?\"An unidentified crowd was gathered around Yeonmu, where the Hwajong Branch would take place.Even that is not all. Even at this moment, people are flocking to prose.What's more bizarre is that every one of them now has a pick-up in their hands. Each of them was carrying chairs and tables around the rubber.Hyun Jong was taken aback by the sudden situation and lost his words for a while. Then Unam came up with an urgent face.\"The Long Man.\"\"What's all this about?\"\"People who came to the mountain gate asked for access to Hwajong Branch with their own eyes. I couldn't stop it blindly because so many people gathered.\"\"Hmmm.\"Hyun Jong drooled.\"Did they call you from Jongnam?\"If so, the purpose is obvious.It's to show them the naked way that Hawasan loses to them.I didn't know when I first saw it, but when I saw it again, the colors of the middlemen were quite colorful. Among them, Hyun Jong also saw some familiar faces, so he probably invited the island's leaders.Those who have recognized themselves are local celebrities in Danju, the island and western region. And even those in official garb can be seen around it.Given their influence on the island, what they saw and heard at the Hwajong Branch today will quickly spread across the island.\"Cheesy!\"Hyun Jong, who is slightly feverish at the thought of that peculiar thought, speaks with a slightly lower voice than usual.\"Don't you know that foreigners shouldn't be allowed in without permission?\"\"One, the long man.\"\"How did you come to terms with their obvious intentions?\"\"Well, that's not it...\u2026.\"\"Huh?\"Then, I heard a low voice in Hyun Jong's ear.\"Long story, I don't think it's been pre-arranged.\"Hyun Jong turned his head.Jong-nam's elder, Sama Seung, was approaching him with a slightly embarrassed face.Hyun Jong paid attention to Sama Seung's 'surprised'.You're saying Jong-nam didn't do this?'If Sama Seung called them, there's no reason to ask such a question with such a flustered face. He would have walked in a relaxed manner and grinning.Hyun Jong sneaked around Unam.\"What happened?\"\"I tried to stop them, but the man who brought them...\u2026.\"\"It's me, Jang Moon-in.\"Hyun Jong and Sama Seung's eyes went back to where the sound came from. A familiar person was walking with a smile.\"You are not great Hwang.\"\"Hwang Dae-in?\"Hwang Munnyak at the top of the galaxy was approaching them.\"I'm in high spirits.\"Hwang Dae-in still wins the lottery. The two were greeted by Hwang Dae-in for now. But the face is still full of questions.Hwang Dae-in, who let go of his hands, smiles brightly.\"The Hwajong Branch will be held, but I don't think there will be any excitement without an audience, so I invited some people.\"\"Hmm.\"As soon as Hyun Jong was about to say something with his brows crossed, Sama Seung beat him.\"That's not a bad idea. Since this is the last Jonghwa branch, it would be okay to have a festival in Seomseo.\"At the same time, it was Sama Sung who gave strength to the word Jonghwa Branch.Hyun Jong sighed low.As long as Hwang invited a person and agreed to it in Jongnam, it is difficult for him to step up and oppose it. Telling those who climbed up this rugged Hawasan to just go back?It's not gonna work.'Words denouncing the harshness of Hawasan will circumnavigate the island. Even more so, considering their influence.It's hard.It was very difficult to knock them out.In the end, Hyun Jong had no choice but to sigh and smile.\"You can do that. Since you're here, enjoy your time.\"\"Thank you for your understanding, Jang Moon-in. Of course.\"Hwang Dae-in smiles and turns around. Mu Young-gae smiled and headed to the audience seats that were being made with Hwang Dae-in.Hwang Dae-in, who was walking in the lead, raises his head and looks at Chung-Myung.All right, that's it's all right.Chung-Myung nods his head still.Exchanging glances, Hwang Dae-in gave an unknown look.The small stamp always surprises me. What are you trying to do this time?'It was none other than Chung-Myung who ordered Hwang Dae-in to gather the masters of the island library. He secretly visited Sodanju in harmony and delivered his words to Hwang Dae-in.First of all, bring everyone you think is famous.I did what I was told. I don't know what's behind it, Little Pillson.'Chung-Myung rolled up the corners of his mouth while receiving Hwang Munnyak's eyes.It's all about growing a board!'What's the point of fighting each other in a place where there's no one?Even if the result is made, no one will believe it when Jong-nam closes his mouth and Hwasan talks. Therefore, we must make everyone see the results of this Hwajong Branch with their own eyes.\"Then that's it for the preparation.\"\"Huh?\"\"No, nothing.\"Do you understand me?How can a Babbird know the meaning of a stork...Isn't this a Babbird and a Stork?Anyway!Jang Moon-sa! I'm thinking like this. Cancel what you said I was stupid!Baby hairs used to work.\"Oh, come on! Can I give you a compliment?\"Jo-Gol frowns and looks back at Chung-Myung.\"Why do you keep talking to yourself? Are you nervous?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"While Chung-Myung sighed, he was roughly ready.The chairs were arranged and the audience sat at a short distance from the smoke and mirrors. Servants who brought the pick-me-up line up after that.\"It looks like it's starting.\"I heard someone's nervous voice.After a while, Unam walks out of the middle of the smoke and mirrors. Standing in the center of the smoke station, he looks around once and holds hands together to win the tickets to the audience.Then he straightened out his chest and took a deep breath. A solemn and loud voice burst out.\"Let's begin this year's Hwajong Branch!\"The atmosphere heated up in an instant.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you.\"Hwang Munnyak smiled at the praise pouring from left and right.\"I must thank you for accepting my invitation. You came all the way here, didn't you?\"\"Hahaha, you can't miss this rare attraction.\"Words of blessing come and go. But Hwang Munnyak didn't miss out on the fact that the middlemen were sifting through the details of those who were set to rise to the occasionally.Those who gathered here could not have come this far simply to find something to see.Their interest is in the future generations of the two literary groups. Among them, Jongnam's late indexers.The upper house and the upper house seem distant but close. The countervailing world, which has to go up and face the minions all the time, is always sensitive to the situation of the strong team. And a strong culture is itself the object of investment.After all, power is the way to attract money.They are trying to gauge the future of Jongnam by evaluating the late index of Jongnam through the Hwajong Branch today.\"Bimura of Jongnam and Hwasan. I'm a little disappointed with the opponent.\"\"You're right. There must be a community or a shaman nearby. Will I be able to show my skills only because my opponent is Hawaiian?\"The public spoke with a low voice.'This is an objective assessment.'Hwang Munnyak also didn't think their assessment was wrong.A hundred years ago, Hawasan is no match for Jongnam. There is no way to compare Jong-nam, who firmly maintains one of the high old file rooms, and Hawasan, who was almost destroyed after being kicked out of the old faction.But...Hwang Munnyak's eyes turned to his disciples across the street. Hwang Munnyak frowns slightly when he can't see Chung-Myung well.'I don't think he's the type to get angry.'So there's something clever about that?Hwang Munnyak smiled.\"I'm not happy that others rush to the preoccupation, but for recovery, Hwasan's reputation needs to spread. So this time, I've cooperated without hesitation, Sopojang.'Hwang Munnyak's heart began to swell with anticipation.In anticipation of what will happen here today.In the middle of the Yeonmu, Sun Unam confronted each other on both sides and signaled to Hwasan and Jongnam's disciples and opened their mouths. It was a little embarrassing because the audience suddenly appeared, but there was no big difficulty in leading the Hwajong branch, which had been continuing steadily.\"First of all, the representatives of each faction's disciples will be one-on-one. Ten representatives of the students of this university will perform ten times.\"cried Unam sternly.\"Leader!\"As soon as the words are over, one person from each side gets up.Jin Geum Ryong\u1100\u116a Baek Cheon.Each of them was the head of the private school's great disciples.\"The death penalty!\"\"Death penalty, stay strong!\"\"You have to win!\"Baek Cheon took a deep breath listening to the priests' support. A stiff face tells how nervous he is now.He turned his head, looked at the priests once, and made his way to the curb. Across from him, Jin Geum Ryong was walking in a very relaxed manner.The two men faced each other in the middle of the smoke range.\"Let's see.\"Along with the top of the galaxy, the mother-of-pearl at the top of the Great Vung, called the Island Observatory, burst into exclamation when she saw Jin Geum Ryong.\"Jin Geum Ryong is said to be a talented person who will open Jongnam's heyday, and he has a great appearance.\"\"It's just a young hero.\"Jin Geum Ryong, wearing a white white suit and holding a wooden sword in one hand, certainly caught people's attention.\"But isn't the author across the street great, if you look at his appearance?\"\"You two look alike, I think they look alike.Yes, black and white. It looks like a picture.\"Baek Cheon, dressed in black suits, was also standing tall against Jin Geum Ryong.\"I'm sure expectations are rising, but will the student of Hwasan be able to deal with Jin Geum Ryong?\"\"I don't know. Actually, it's true that he's been struggling so much, but it could be different in recent years. If you think about the past wasan, there might be an unexpected thing.\"That's what I said, but nobody thought Baek Cheon would beat Jin Geum Ryong.Now Hawasan is not what it used to be. Doesn't that prove that the people here cut off the deal with Hawasan a long time ago? If he thought there was a chance of a resurgence, he wouldn't have cut the leash completely.All those who are here now expected was how strong Jongnam showed.Sama Seung, who overheard the conversation from the side, slightly stiffens her face. I know you're being polite, but that kind of thing makes you feel bad.'Show me. Gold dragon.Now, the reality is that Hawasan is not in a position to even mention his name alongside Jongnam.Hyunjong also closed his lips and looked at Baek Cheon.\"Show me everything about you'really.'So that you don't regret it.While everyone's expectations and concerns were focused, Jin Geum Ryong and Baek Cheon looked at each other.The first thing to say is Jin Geum Ryong.\"You didn't run away.\"Baek Cheon replied with a stern face.\"I am a great disciple of Hwasan. There's no way I'm gonna run away with Jong-nam.\"\"You've got a big mouth.\"Jin Geum Ryong held up the sword and aimed Baek Cheon.\"Dogs are always good at building.\"\"Are you going to be bitten by the dog?\"\"I made a mistake. You can't even be a dog.\"\"This...\"\"Let's go at it. I'll tell you personally as I said yesterday. What a trifle you are.\"Baek Cheon did not bother to answer. Instead, he turned his eyes slightly to where Hyun Jong would sit.'A man of letters is watching.'It's time to put aside personal grudges and self-interest.'I'm Baek Cheon, a great student of Hawasan.'Baek Cheon glared at Jin Geum Ryong with determined eyes. And he, too, held up a wooden sword and pointed at him.Everyone looked at the two with nervous eyes.On one side, the representative of Hawasan. And the opponent is also a representative of Jongnam. Originally, the two who are supposed to face off at the end will face off first according to the tradition of Hwajong Branch.In a way, the result of Hwajong Branch is almost like a result of this match. So how can you not be interested?Just as someone tried to open their mouth, Baek Cheon moved.Scream!The sound of hitting the floor rings clearly.Baek Cheon, who hit forward at a formidable speed, stabs Jin Geum Ryong straight into the neck with a sword that contains no change.Let's start.Jin Geum Ryong does not stand up to the flying sword, but avoids it as if he is stepping aside.Clare fluid!Baek Cheon's sword quickly chased Jin Geum Ryong. The wrist seemed to shake slightly, and soon the tip of the sword swelled to dozens.Hwasan's colorful sword covers the lotus field.\"Oh, oh.\"Amazing!\"\"Hwasan's child seems to be very talented.\"It was a splendid herbivore that even those who watched it could not help but admire it.Although it is a wooden sword rather than a real sword, its keenness is no less than a real sword. The world's Jin Geum Ryong also stayed behind to see if there was any way to deal with this colorful herbivore.Hwasan's great and three great disciples clench their fists as they watch it.Jo-Gol exclaimed excitedly.\"As expected of Baek Cheon! It's worth calling a double-edged sword of private residence the first verse!\"Each of Hawasan's disciples was excited.They know.How Baek Cheon has been training his bones. Since being humiliated at the last Hwajong Branch, Baek Cheon has forgotten about erosion and devoted himself to training.It was Baek Cheon who volunteered to close the building. The person who can live the most pleasant and colorful life in Hawasan has locked himself up to stop interacting with people and look back only on the sword.How can I not cheer for such a man?You're pushing me.Baek Cheon's swordstroke drove Jin Geum Ryong splendidly and sharply. Each of those examinations contains sharp examples. It is hard to tell what is real and what is fake because of the mixture of the weeds and herbs.Hyun Jong, who saw it, clenches his fist tightly.\"When will that kid ever reach that level?'If it is that bad, it is not that bad compared to a boat. I knew you were talented, but I didn't expect you to be that talented!The eyes of all the Hawasan Mundo watching Baek Cheon's propaganda were colored with hope.Maybe...Maybe this time it will be different.Even Yoon-jong couldn't hide his excitement.\"Chung-Myung\u110b\u1161! The private sector is pushing you!\"\"Yes.\"\"Maybe I'll win!\"\"No way.\"\"Huh?\"Yoon-jong looked back at Chung-Myung. Chung-Myung, leaning back on the chair, says with a dim face.\"You have to hit something to win or not. I can't even touch him.\"\"But the victory...\u2026.\"\"Does the death penalty show the face of the man who wins?\"\"Huh?\"Yoon-jong turned his head and looked at Baek Cheon again. And soon I had no choice but to harden my face.Baek Cheon's face was distorted by the struggle.'Why!'Baek Cheon swung the sword with all his might.The foot steps strongly on the right angle. The energy raised around the tightly fixed lower body is pushed into the fingertips. It is not long before the sword is brandished with all its might.Lightly, lightly.Light but sharp as a butterfly flies!But the light, sharp black Jin Geum Ryong's body never touched.Why can't you even touch it? Why!'It's far away.The opponent in front of me is too distant. It's like watching a cliff soar high into the sky.A cliff I don't dare climb or cross.Already drenched, Baek Cheon rants, unable to even wipe away the sweat seeping into his eyes.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"Deadly blow!At the same time, Baek Cheon's sword, which occupied twelve bags, flew toward Jin Geum Ryong.It was that moment.Whoops!Jin Geum Ryong's first swinging sword bounces off Baek Cheon's flying sword.When the sword stopped, the sword, which covered the smoke field, also disappeared. Only then could Baek Cheon clearly see Jin Geum Ryong's face.Unlike him, who has already been soaked, Jin Geum Ryong, who does not sweat a drop and does not even breathe, looks at him with a fishy smile.\"You've had enough fun, haven't you?\"\"\u2026\u2026you.\"\"Dumb, do you think you can touch the tip of my hair no matter how hard I try to learn Hwasan's martial arts?\"Jin Geum Ryong's sword pierces Baek Cheon like a light stick.Push!Baek Cheon, stabbed in the shoulder, rolls around the floor without even screaming.\"Turn it off...\"He groaned and forced himself up.As I raised my head, I could see Jin Geum Ryong approaching him with a relaxed smile.\"Learn enough from the body. How stupid you are.\"Jin Geum Ryong's sword struck Baek Cheon mercilessly.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was Jin Geum Ryong who best matched Baek Cheon's saying that he was a genius.I've already experienced defeat.Back Cheon did not win against Jin Geum Ryong in the last episode of \"Jong Hwe\" and before that. I've only tasted the bitterness of a thorough defeat.One.'I thought it'd be narrow down.'Because you've worked so hard.Chung-Myung commented on his efforts that it wasn't right, but Baek Cheon endured a real bone-cutting ordeal. At least I'm confident I've trained twice as much as Jin Geum Ryong.Therefore, I believe that if I didn't win, I would have narrowed the gap a little bit.But the reality is always worse than imagined.Screaming!\"Gasp!\"Jin Geum Ryong's sword hits Baek Cheon's ankle. Baek Cheon, who almost stumbled and fell, desperately balanced and bit his teeth.If it was a real sword, my ankle was just severed. It's over because it's a wooden sword, not a real sword.On the contrary, however, he is not even allowed the freedom to lose because it is not the real sword.Why can't I even reach it?'Why?I've been trying so hard!Screaming!Jin Geum Ryong's sword, which flew back, struck Baek Cheon on the other thigh.Almost a bone-breaking shock. I was momentarily distraught, but I didn't even groan, let alone scream. He slaps the floor with a wooden sword and throws himself forward with the recoil.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"His sword hits Jin Geum Ryong's head. A simple blow that excluded change, but it was as fast and as sharp.\"Slow.\"However, Jin Geum Ryong completely nullified Baek Cheon's stroke by taking a step sideways and twisting his body.Screaming!Jin Geum Ryong's sword hits Baek Cheon on the left shoulder.The flesh bursts out and the blood rises.\"Gasp.\"One more attack to complete the beemoos perfectly. But Jin Geum Ryong didn't finish and stepped back.Then he looked down at Baek Cheon with an arrogant expression.\"Oops.\"Baek Cheon raised himself again with one hand on the floor.\"\u2026\u2026.\"eyes shot with bloodOverlapped with pain, but determined eyes glower at Jin Geum Ryong.\"Whoa?\"Jin Geum Ryong looks at Baek Cheon as if he's surprised.\"Hard to stand still, the spite is still alive.\"Jin Geum Ryong holds up the sword and points at Baek Cheon.\"But that's it. You can't cut a hem of my clothes for the rest of your life.\"\"\u2026\u2026why?\"\"What a poor understanding. That's what I told you.\"Jin Geum Ryong looked around and opened his mouth.\"That means there's a big difference between you and our Jongnam. Hwasan's Muhakness is no match for Jongnam's Muhakness. A hundred years! A thousand years later!\"It was a very arrogant declaration.But no one could refute what Jin Geum Ryong said. Even Hawasan's mundos, who heard this haughty sound, could not bring themselves to shout out their anger, biting their lips.Hyun Jong closes his eyes while watching the scene.How far do you think you have to go?'Who can understand his situation where he cannot even commit any punishment even though he is just a great student of a literary group, uttering such arrogant words?'Good men.'Forgive me for my sins.However, Jin Geum Ryong's arrogance did not stop there.He smiled at Baek Cheon.\"If you want to catch up with me right now, you'd better leave Hawaii right now. There is no future here. The only thing left in the ruined literary circle is ridicule.\"Baek Cheon clenched his teeth.\"I am a disciple of\u2026\u2026Hwasan.\"\"Well, that's great, a man would do that's what he should do. But....\"Jin Geum Ryong takes the sword and floods Baek Cheon.Baek Cheon tried somehow to stop the flying sword, but his arm stopped moving.Furbuck! Furbuck!Baek Cheon, who was beaten by a dozen people at once with the sound of a large leather drum, finally falls down.Crying.Jin Geum Ryong, who glanced back at the unconscious Baek Cheon, smiled, twisting his mouth.\"I'm not going to let that slide. Oh, no. Is it a little late to talk?\"With a fishy smile, Jin Geum Ryong lightly recovered the wooden sword. Then he rode over the fallen Baek Cheon and headed to his camp.DefeatIt was a perfect defeat.\"The death penalty!\"\"Shooting!\"Only then did the disciples of Hawasan, who came to their senses, run out to the curb.\"Household, private!\"Don't mess with me!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Baek Sang, who carefully hugged the unconscious Baek Cheon, bowed his head in silence for a moment. Then he soon turns into a grimly distorted face.\"This isn't too much!\"Jin Geum Ryong, who was returning to his place, turned his head and looked at Baek Sang.\"What's so bad about it?\"\"It's a dagger! How can you hurt your opponent so much when you're working?\"\"Bimura... ..so isn't it over?\"\"\u2026\u2026What?\"Jin Geum Ryong put a sneer in his mouth.\"If I had heard the truth, what would he have done by now?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I was able to save my life because it was empty. Don't you think so?\"\"How dare you...\u2026.\"\"Don't be so angry.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Jin Geum Ryong said with a grin.\"I'm pretty embarrassed, too. I didn't think you'd be that weak. I thought it would block a little. I apologize for that.\"The people bit their lips until they bleed.A perfect defeat.And a far-over-the-top taunt.The heart collapses and the blood rises upside down. If I could, I would like to bring him to heaven.But there was nothing Baek Sang could do now.\"Bring the death penalty to the infirmary! Right now!\"\"Yes!\"Baek Sang pulled out a wooden sword as the priests ran with Baek Cheon in their arms.\"Let's see if it's the sword of the noble Jong-nam.\"\"There's nothing you can't do. Letter.\"\"Yes, death penalty!\"\"Treat me.\"\"Yes, sir!\"Jong Seo-han entered the smoke range with a smile.Looking at him leisurely walking out, Baek Sang grabbed the wooden sword.Contrary to the increasingly unarmed atmosphere, the crowd's atmosphere was very cordial.\"It's great.\"\"Baek Cheon was stronger than I thought. But Jin Geum Ryong's achievement is beyond expectations.\"\"He's a good fit for the word 'Seomseo First.' And Jongnam, who has such a person as his disciple, is also worthy of the Seomseo First Munpa.\"\"You mean this. Hahahaha.\"Hwang Munnyak has a stiff look on his face.This is why merchants are.'Should I say homophobic?One man is carried away in a disastrous manner, and no one cares about that fact. There is no one to blame for seeing too much hands.A matter of course, of course.They only care about Jin Geum Ryong and Jongnam's power and how to roll the money.Hwang Munnyak is not much different from them either, but I couldn't hide my disgust with them at this moment.This is such a disastrous defeat.'Baek Cheon\u1100\u116a Jin Geum Ryong.Despite the confrontation between Hwasan and Jongnam representatives, it was not one-sided, which resulted in embarrassing results.Until the end, Baek Cheon couldn't even touch Jin Geum Ryong's hem.If the Hwajong branch goes on like this until the end, Hawasan will not regain his old reputation by any means.No, it is likely that the downfall will accelerate further. Because no one will admit to wasan.No matter how much money Huang Munnyak throws in, it's irreversible. It was nothing short of a death sentence.What the hell are you thinking?'I thought there would be a right strategy to attract people with confidence and open the door. But now even that is beginning to become suspicious.\"Am I overestimating the small stamp too much?'Hwang Munnyak's eyes were fixed on Chung-Myung.\"\u2026\u2026Will private accommodation be okay?\"\"You're not gonna be okay.\"\"Are they hurt a lot?\"\"I'm hurt a lot.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung's lukewarm response eventually leads to Yoon-jong's slightly angry face.\"No matter how bad the relationship is, that's your private residence. Did you really say that you didn't mind when your private residence was so devastated?\"\"Calm down, death penalty.\"\"Dude!\"\"Calm down, I told you.\"Yoon-jong slightly disagreed with Chung-Myung's voice that had subsided. It is different from Chung-Myung's usual reaction.\"Then you thought you'd win?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yoon-jong bit his lips.I didn't want to win. But... I thought I would save face at least. Baek Cheon receives all of Hwasan's expectations.Maybe the reason why Yoon-Jong is so excited now is because of the fact that Baek Cheon was injured and that he lost so horribly.\"You mean the gap with Jong Nam was this wide?'Old file rooms, old file rooms, but in Hwasan the disciples didn't feel so great about it. They used to belong to old file rooms, too.It is now collapsed, but if poetry and effort are combined, it is believed that there is a possibility that it will someday compete against the old file room.But the walls of the old file room were higher and larger than they thought.Chung-Myung smirks.\"If you think you can do everything by trying, there's no one in the world who's not a master. It's not about trying, it's about how you try.\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"Look, look carefully from now on. All of his students will lose.\"\"Everything?\"\"No one deserves to win. No, there's one...\u2026, apparently he won't go out.\"Yoon-Jong hardened his face.At the Hwajong Branch last time, Lee Dae-dae's achievements were two draws and eight losses.It's a disastrous performance.By the way, don't you mean we won't even get a draw this time?\"\u2026\u2026I'm losing like this.\"It's miserable like this way to go.But then Chung-Myung opens his eyes wide and looks at Yoon-Jeong.\"Who's going to lose?\"\"Huh? Did you just...\u2026.\"\"That's a high school student!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"Chung-Myung blinked his eyes.\"How dare the Jongnamites go back to victory in Wasan? With whose permission?\u00a0 As long as I keep my eyes open, I'll never see you like that! I can't even see the dirt in my eyes!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"So warm up. Maybe we should do something more flashy.\"\"No, the\u2026\u2026.\"It was then.\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\"In a hurry, Yoon-jong turned his head. It was not long before Baek Sang came into his eyes, lying brutally on the floor.Jong Seo-han kicked Baek Sang who fell down.\"I think we can still fight.\"\"Uhhhhhhh.\"All I do is talk.\"Jong Seo-han gives Baek Sang a glimpse, raises his head and looks at his students. Then he made arsenic as if to say hello.Chung-Myung's mouth opened.\"No, but is that him?\"\"Hold it!\"The three great disciples rushed in and held Chung-Myung and stretched.Looking at it, I laughed as if I was dumbfounded.\"You're looking at all sorts of things. Anyway, it's an unknown door.\"\"Oh, what?Chung-Myung's eyes slightly flip.\"Let's see how long the laughter lasts in the mouth.\"I took a picture of you.It's too late to regret it!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But Hyun Jong could not answer any of the questions.Stop?How am I supposed to stop this?In the presence of many of these island leaders,\"We can't be Jong-nam's opponent, and we'll only hurt the children if we do more, so I think it's better to stop here.'You want me to say that?It's a disgrace to Hawasan's name.No matter how much Hwasan has fallen...\u2026. No, there is something to protect because it has fallen. That is the name and pride.If the name of Hwasan and his pride of Mundo are not kept, Hwasan is reduced to a mere third-rate clan, not a ruined one.And that's the moment Hwasan drops the signboard.Hyun Jong couldn't do that. It is not for the sake of one's own honor. I can't say that as a long-term writer, even to protect the possibility of Hawasan's resurrection one day.But the situation was extremely bad enough for Hyun Sang, who was fully aware of this situation, to say so.Lose consecutive games.Nine people lost in a row.It has already achieved the worst performance ever in Hwajong Branch. But the bigger problem was not winning or losing, but the content.As many as nine people have never touched their opponents properly while competing. I thought it would be less disastrous for a grown-up and a young child to fight.And all the island leaders are watching this scene.What am I supposed to do with this disgrace?'Hyun Jong's eyes trembled.It feels like all five intestines are torn apart, and the heart is being torn with hands.It wasn't this disgrace he was suffering from now on that really afflicted him. It was because I could guess how much despair the disciples must be in now.The children were pushed into their limbs because they could not properly gauge their opponent's strength. Considering the mental pain those children will suffer due to these incompetent long-term men, I want to chop myself with a sharp knife.\"Long-lived...\"Hyun Jong opened his eyes still.And soon there is a deep salivation.\"\u2026\u2026it's a sign.\"\"One\u2026\u2026.\"\"Wouldn't I make you sick?\"It was that moment.\"Gasp!\"The last student of Ewha Womans University, who was competing against each other on the soft armament, loses his sword and falls to the floor.In a way, it is a disgrace that the prosecutor missed the sword. Jong-nam's disciple, who cleverly aimed at his wrist until the end, whistles.\"I can't believe the prosecutor missed the sword. Hasn't Hwasan taught you that either?\"mockeryI can't help it, even though I know that ridicule is already an agreed result.10 consecutive losses.This is no more disastrous result. Elder Hawasan's faces are horribly distorted.Are you sure this is what happened?'Now I think I've got a chance to bring up Hwasan again. Only good things have happened recently.But all of those who have been in their dreams are facing cold reality at this moment. In the end, Hawasan is Mufah. No luxury is meaningful if Muhak does not support it.Everyone here is now keenly aware of that fact.\"Well done.\"\"Yes, Elder!\"Sama Seung patted Akho on the shoulder when he returned to his seat.It is a result of absolute satisfaction.Not only did everyone win, but the content of the absence was very one-sided. The most encouraging thing is that island leaders are watching the contents of this match.Now, Hawasan's reputation has fallen to the ground and will never resonate again.'Isn't that the situation you've been hoping for so many times since your generation? I'm so glad that I'm able to fulfill that long-cherished desire with none other than Sama Seung's hands.Sama Sung listened carefully. Perhaps by now, the people watching have grasped the situation.Sure enough, I can hear a murmur.\"This is too one-sided.\"\"But I had a little expectation because it was Hawaiian\u2026\u2026. The past seems to be the past and the present. Hwasan is no longer what he used to be.\"\"Didn't you know that?\"\"But it's not so terrible...\u2026. In fact, I can't tell whether Jongnam is strong or Hwasan is weak.\"\"Both, isn't it?\"\"It's a shame. It's a shame. I guess it's really over with wasan now. It's because I feel so vain..\"Sama Seung twisted the corners of her mouth and laughed.Public opinion has turned completely to the south. However, his purpose today is not to elevate Jong-nam's status. It was to drop Hawasan into the abyss.In order to do so, even the sprouts need to be burned so that they do not grow.\"Well, it's time to wrap up. Did you see what the private servants do?\"\"Yes, Elder!\"Jongnam's three great disciples look at him with determined faces.\"Don't hesitate.\"SAMA SEUNG glowed his eyes.\"A lion does his best even when he catches a rabbit. Don't give me a hard time. We must destroy them so that they will never learn martial arts again.\"\"Yes, I'll keep that in mind!\"Samsung looked up at the sky with a fishy smile.It's such a sunny day.'And it's such a great day.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Yoon-Jong is at a loss for words.I can't bear to look back at the disciples of Ewha Womans University gathered on the side. You can tell without looking. What they look like now. And how much despair they must be in.And so did the three great disciples.\"You mean the difference with Jong-nam was so great?'So far, Hwajong Branch has had its own blend of flavors. Defeat was the same, but it wasn't as one-sided as it is now when a man presses an ant to death.Only then did Yoon-jong realize that Jong-nam had never truly faced Hawasan.\"\u2026\u2026is it our turn?\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"The faces of the three great disciples turn dark.It is true that they have been trained by Chung-Myung, but the huge gap in front of them takes away even the confidence gained from the training.No, but it's all gone, so now, uh...\u2026.That's not the problem now...\u2026.Yoon-jong sneaked away and looked at Chung-Myung sitting next to him.And yuck, I held my breath.Crunch!The sound of grinding teeth makes Yoon-jong's heart sink.Chung-Myung's face is red and almost burst.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Every time the private servants were defeated, their faces seemed to turn red little by little, and now they turned red like plum blossoms in full bloom.Seeing the face, Yoon-jong carefully reached out and grabbed Chung-Myung's dress.He's about to explode.Three years of Seodang dog recite good deeds, and three months of being next to Chung-Myung makes you a master of reading the room.Yoon-jong opened his mouth in a trembling voice.\"Cheo, Chung-Myung, calm down.\"\"\u2026\u2026Calm down?\"As soon as he hears that crooked voice, Yoon-jong puts something down in his mind...\u2026. No, you can't put it down! It's Hwajong Branch! Not only the long writers, but also the people of Jongnam and Seomseo are watching!If this guy has a seizure here, maybe more will happen than all of his students lost.Yoon-jong began to raise Chung-Myung with a feeling of soothing a crazy dog.\"Cheo, Chung-Myung. Think carefully. You said that yesterday. Patience is the most important thing for a man to do a big deal!\"\"\u2026\u2026patience.\"\"Yes, patience!\"\"\u2026\u2026the death penalty.\"\"Yes, Chung-Myung. I remember your words well...\u2026.\"\"I've been thinking.\"\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung's head slowly, very slowly, towards Yoon-Jeong.AndYoon-jong saw it.Chung-Myung's eyes are half turned.\"\u2026\u2026I.\"Chung-Myung growls like an animal and raises himself.\"There's no such thing as patience!\"Show off.You punk.Unam took a deep breath. His face was so tired that he couldn't be any more.I'd like to get down from here now if I could think of it. However, unless instructed by a long-time writer, he must continue this Hwajong Branch.\"Next is... ..the three great disciples. Of the three great disciples...\u2026.\"It was then.\"Hold him! Don't let him go!\"\"Chung-Myung, you were supposed to go last! This is not good!\"\"People see, people see! Please only do it when we're alone!\"Unam looked back at the three great disciples with bewildered eyes.Someone tries to walk out of the three great disciples who are united and trying to block something.'Chung-Myung?'What's wrong with him?Questions abound, but I must finish what I was saying the time being. They're not the only ones here.\"The vanguard is\u2026\u2026.\"\"Screaming!\"But Unam's words could not continue.As soon as the word vanguard comes out, Chung-Myung blows back the death penalty that somehow held him, and jumps up to the smoke and mirrors.\"Whoosh!\"Chung-Myung, who is on the haze, breathes deeply. Then he stares at Jong-nam with sparkling eyes and says.\"One, come on!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"\"I like anyone. One of you, come on up. Before it's all gone.\"Sama Sung opened her mouth.\"\u2026\u2026that crazy thing!\"I thought you were out of your mind, but you're so crazy. Not only Jong-nam, but also the island's leaders are watching, and they're so self-indulgent!\"Calm down, Elder.\"Jin Geum Ryong quickly stopped Sama Seung from seizing.\"You can't run around with him just because he's running. He'll know my subject soon enough.\"\"Hmm!\"However, Jin Geum Ryong stumbles low, watching Sama Sung, who still doesn't seem to be upset and coughs loudly.\"Good.\"\"Yes, private residence!\"Sunwoo-ryang, who was supposed to deal with Chung-Myung, nods firmly.\"Unlike I thought, I've taken the lead, but it doesn't make any difference. Let him know my subject!\"\"Yes, private residence, don't worry!\"Sunwoo-ryang grabbed a wooden sword and flew away to get unarmed.Then he aimed Chung-Myung with a sword in his hand.\"I'll crush your big mouth. I'm Jongnam's...\u2026.\"At that moment, Chung-Myung disappeared as if he were falling apart on the spot and appeared right in front of Sunwoo-ryang.\"First\u2026\u2026.\"Sunwoo saw it.An angry asura face pops up in front of him. And the appearance is suddenly covered with darkness.Darkness?Why the darkness in broad daylight...\u2026.Oh! It's not dark, it's covered. It's right in front of me, so it's...\u2026.Fist?And at that moment.Hwasan's Mundos heard a huge sound that had never been heard of since they entered Hwasan.Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!It's spinning.Sunwoo-ryang's body spins more than a dozen times in Ho Gong, then flaps on the floor and falls over.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Sunwoo-ryang's body, stuck on the floor, convulses pitifully as if he has a disease.Chung-Myung, who saw the fallen Sunwoo-ryang, speaks as if he were dumbfounded.\"You're acting up to nothing.\"I'm going to kill you.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Argh!Blood from his nose was scattered all over the place like fog along the rotating body of Seonwoo-ryang.\"If you're good at that, you'll get a rainbow.'A rainbow made of blood.What else in the world would be so terrible.It feels like the boundary between common sense and non-sense is collapsing.Sunwoo, which was spinning with blood, soon fell to the floor and twitched. Looking at him, everyone could clearly hear Chung-Myung's voice.\"You're acting up to nothing.\"Chung-Myung spits on the floor. And pull out a wooden sword with a waistline.\"Wake up, you son of a b*tc*. I'm not finished yet. My anger doesn't end like this!\"It's Chung-Myung roaring like a lion, but it's not magnificent...\u2026.I think it's dirty and petty.'It was the honest feelings of Yoon-Jong.\"What\u2026\u2026?\"Sama Seung's beard trembles.'What the...'\u2026.'It happened before my eyes, but I still don't understand what happened.Chung-Myung seemed to have disappeared for a moment, and appeared in front of Sunwoo-ryang and fired a blow. And the beating Sunwoo literally spins like a top in the air and falls to the floor.This is the whole story of what Samsung saw.The problem is that it seems to have disappeared.\"I missed that kid's move?'No matter how nervous the three great disciples were, does it make sense that Jongnam's elder, he missed the movement of the three great disciples of Hawasan?'No, it's not. It can't be!'Sama Seung denied what she saw. But this is not his fault. Even if someone other than Samsung stood here, they would have reacted the same way.Everyone is bound to deny and doubt anything that transcends common sense.\"That coward!\"At that time, the angry voice from the side awakened Sama Seung.\"A surprise attack while we're talking! Hasn't Hwasan even got the decency!\"\"That son of a b*tc*!\"\"\u2026\u2026.\"I guess that's what it looked like to these kids.That's it.The higher the meaning, the more surprising it is. It's no wonder Chung-Myung missed his move for a while.But Sama Seung is different. Isn't he Jongnam's elder?Sama Seung soothed her surprised heart and focused again on the non-stage.\"Good luck, wake up!\"\"Wake up, blue-chip!\"There are cheers from all over the place for good rain. Sama Seung stared at Sunwoo-ryang, who had fallen with his eyes still in shock.'I must have been mistaken.'It's got to be.No, you have to.\"Wake up, man. I didn't even put my balls in it. It's not a crybaby.\"Chung-Myung shot Sunwoo with blazing eyes.In the southern part of the country, he was seethingly vomiting, but the sound of the dog was not heard in Chung-Myung's ears.If you were on the stage, you wouldn't be able to be on the stage. What kind of courtesy is it to freeze to death? Even if we fight a war, we shake hands, we have a drink, and then we start fighting.\"Ugh\u2026\u2026Ugh...\u2026.\"At that moment, good rain stumbles and raises itself.It was a fist that was coldly beaten but didn't carry the strength, so it wouldn't have been enough to blow away consciousness.What if it's my fault?He's dead! What are you asking?Chung-Myung pats himself on the shoulder with a wooden sword while looking at Sunwoo-ryang standing up.\"Get up quickly. The time I have...Are you okay?\"The irritating voice of Chung-Myung abated rapidly.\"Wow\u2026\u2026\"Gulp, gulping.Gulping.This is because Seonwoo-ryang's nose, which raised his body, spilled blood like a waterfall.How much blood is flowing out, wetting the top of the stomach in an instant and gathering to the floor. Even the world's Chung-Myung wince.Sunwoo-ryang stumbles and raises himself up, gasps a few times, and then opens his mouth with difficulty.\"I, I can still fight\u2026\u2026.\"\"I'm dying.\"No, he's really going to die.Does a broken nose usually bleed that much? I'd have to punch a man in the face with a fist without balls.Sun Woo-ryang supported himself with trembling legs and held his nose with both hands.\"Blood, it won't stop...\u2026.\"\"You're going to die, man!\"You're going to die!No, I'm not the one who has a problem killing people, but I'm not like this!I can't believe that the first murder in my life has been beaten to death by excessive bleeding in the middle of the rain. What the f*ck are you talking about?The frightened Chung-Myung said, looking back at Unam with a slightly bored face.\"Shouldn't you have her treated?\"It's murder day in Hawasan.\"Well, that's the rule, uh...\u2026.\"Unam is also embarrassed by the unexpected situation and cannot speak properly. In this case, there is no regulation on whether it is okay to return after treatment. I think we need to ask for both sides' understanding, but isn't this a relaxed situation?Boo! Boo! Boo!At that moment, Sunwoo-ryang tore off the hem of his clothes and began to cram it into his nose.Oh?You're smart.The hem of the clothes was stained with blood in an instant, but as I kept stuffing it in, it seems that it prevented blood from flowing out somehow. Sun Woo-ryang, who controlled the bleeding, held a wooden sword and aimed at Chung-Myung.Oh, you want to go on?Jongnam definitely doesn't give up easily because they have chubby bones. Wow. The culture is different, but I'm proud of it.\u2026.\"You cowardly bastard!\"\u2026\u2026Huh?\"Chung-Myung's head slightly tilted.\"I'm ashamed... ..cough! Shame on you! Cough! Cough! I don't know what you're doing this!\"Just do one thing, dude.If you want to get angry, get angry. If you're going to get sick, you're going to be sick.\"I'll tear you apart and feed you dog food!\"Chung-Myung narrowed his forehead.Let's cancel the compliment for now.\"Do Jong-nam learn how to curse first? They all don't know what's going on.\"- Is that what you're gonna say?Come out when it's worth it! I am now honoured by the hon. Up high, huh?Chung-Myung grabbed the wooden sword and nodded.\"I was a little sorry, but now it's all about to disappear. Don't just brush your mouth to mouth.\u2026.\"\"It's too late if you come now and hit your head and beg for it's too late! You son of a b*tc*! I'll smash it so your parents don't even recognize it.\"\"Oh, keep shaking. It's all right now.\"I'm sorry, but it's gone.Chung-Myung also held a wooden sword and aimed at good luck.\"Bring it on.\"\"\u2026\u2026you son of a b*tc*!\"\"Come on, I'll show you what it's like to not touch a hair.\"\"Hi, right now!\"It was then!\"Good luck!\"A sharp voice bursts out from behind Sunwoo-ryang's back. Sunwoo, who turned his head reflexively, flinched at Jin Geum Ryong's stiff face.\"Don't get carried away. Don't underestimate your opponent.\"Sunwoo-ryang looked back at Chung-Myung with an aching face.All of the students overpowered their opponents without being beaten, but they were more excited than necessary to think that they were the only ones who came up and humiliated.I grew up hearing that an excited person couldn't show his or her skills, but I forgot about it in the actual game.Sun Woo-ryang took a deep breath and controlled his mind. I felt something uncomfortable because I couldn't breathe through my nose, but I was able to recover my coolness soon.After getting his breath together, he glared at Chung-Myung with a different cold eye.\"That's a hell of a yardstick!\"\"...yes, I did.\"Let's just say so. I don't know what I did, but if you do, it is.\"I'll let you know that if you get along properly, you'll never be a disciple of Hwasan. Especially you'd better be prepared. Don't ask for trouble in my hands.\"\"Yes, yes. Is there a possibility? If you're done, come on. I'll show you what I can't even touch.\"\"You will not even touch me!\"\"You've already been punched.\"Doesn't your nose hurt?\"I'll kill you! You son of a b*tc*! Oh, my God!\"Sunwoo-ryang swung a wooden sword at Chung-Myung.The sword tips sharp foreshadowing whether it has regained its composure. Among Jongnam's three great disciples, it was said that he was the best in ability.It wouldn't have been easy to deal with good luck no matter who came out of Hawasan. Even if there was a great disciple, not the three great disciples.But it's too bad for Sun Woo-ryang, but the opponent was too bad.His opponent is none other than Hwasan's disaster, Chung-Myung.\"No!\"Chung-Myung pulls the wooden sword back.Then he rushed at full speed toward the incoming good rain.\"Huh?\"Chung-Myung's sword, which stretched out backward, swings at lightning speed and hits Sunwoo-ryang's head.Argh! Argh!There was no such thing as avoiding it.How can I avoid invisible swords?Sunwoo-ryang opens his mouth and turns his eyes upside down.He's dead.That's pretty much dead.''That's polite to die.'The body of good rain crumbles down. But Chung-Myung didn't intend to stop there.\"These days!\"Argh! Argh!One more shot before you faint.\"Babies!\"Argh! Argh!One more time!\"That's rude! Manners!\"Chung-Myung's wooden sword literally slaps the body of Sunwoo-ryang who falls to the floor.\"It wasn't like that back in my day, eh!\"If Cheon Mun heard it from the sky, he would throw the captain he was holding and bubble it.Unfortunately, however, the lineage cannot be involved in the present world.\"Oh, my God!\"Oh, my god!Finally, Chung-Myung, who kicked up Sunwoo's crotch, turned around.Sunwoo, which soared three times to Ho Gong, falls to the bottom.Cooooong!Chung-Myung clicked his tongue.\"If I hadn't cursed at you, I would've gone easy on you. Anyways, these days. What!\"Listening to words that could not be found with any conscience, all three of the disciples vowed not to swear at him no matter what.\"Oh, right.\"Chung-Myung turned around again and stretched out on the floor to reach the twitching Sun Wu-liang.Then reach out and pull out the hem of the clothes covering his nose.The blood that had been blocked begins to flow out again.\"How was it? You didn't even touch it, did you?\"It's a little bit different.Chung-Myung turns his head and looks at Jongnam.Neither Samsung nor Jin Geum Ryong nor other Jongnam's students could shut their mouths wide open. I just stare blankly at Chung-Myung with a mixture of astonishment and embarrassment.\"Surprised.\"We haven't even started yet. Don't be surprised already.Chung-Myung gives them a glimpse and returns to his camp.Looking at the back of it, Sama Sung muttered unconsciously.\"What the hell is going on...\u2026.\"But no one here knew this was just the beginning.Except for Chung-Myung, the only one.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
