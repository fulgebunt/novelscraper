    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: The City Is Really DangerousQingshan Province was the province with the largest forest coverage area in China. Because it was located in the borders of China, the mountains and jungles were predominant, the natural environment was complicated, and the roads were impassable. Coupled with the tremendous area it occupied, Qingshan Province was also the province with the largest gap between the rich and the poor in China.In the depths of the majestic mountains, there were poor and backward villages. Inside, were many older people who have never left the mountains in their entire lives, because it was just too difficult to go out due to the rugged mountain road.Chen Yu was the typical child of the mountains, her childhood dream was to be educated just like the village chief, studying properly, each day moving a step forward, then become admitted to a good university, finally getting out of the mountain. Although the old man who adopted her always told her that she could leave the mountain when the time comes even if she didn\u2019t study hard, however, Chen Yu believed that these were lies made by the 'paranormal fraud' old man to entice her to give up her study sessions, and to instead learn how to catch ghosts with him.That\u2019s right, Chen Yu was an orphan. According to the old man who adopted her, Chen Yu was picked up by him at the foot of the mountain fifteen years ago by chance. When he found her, Chen Yu already lost two out of 3 of her souls, she almost breathed her last breath, and it was due to him performing the ritual in time to call her souls back that Chen Yu was able to live healthily until now.[T/N: In daoism, there are three hun and seven po, in this case, Chen Yu lost two of her hun, which was the \u2018soul\u2019 / \u2018energy\u2019. The three types of hun are: neutral, yin, yang]Towards this, Chen Yu blindly believed him before she reached seven years old, and after seven, she had no other way but to believe it even more. After all, when she opened her yin-yang eyes, she can see ghosts and spirits, furthermore, the old man believed in feudalistic superstition that was really unrealistic.In any case, Chen Yu, who had always been determined that studying was the only way out of the village, finally received the university admission notice. At that moment, the excited Chen Yu promised to the village chief: \u201cVillage chief, it is Damu Village who brought me up, wait until I have good business later and make some money, I will definitely contribute to my hometown\u2019s road construction project.\u201dThe village chief\u2019s eyes brimming with excited tears, holding Chen Yu\u2019s hands with an almost sobbing voice as he said, \u201cGood child, remember your home even if you\u2019re out there ah.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of studying books? If you study my skills properly and get yourself out there for a few years, you alone will be able to pay for the whole road construction.\u201d 'Paranormal fraud' old man knocked on the dry cigarette and humphed on the side.\u201cIf you\u2019re so powerful, then why haven\u2019t I see you repair the road in these years?\u201d Every time 'Paranormal fraud' old man bragged how his ability to catch ghosts can make big money, Chen Yu will criticize him about it.After all, if you only charge one hundred yuan every time you catch a ghost, how many years would it be before he can get rich? Even she had to get a poverty certificate to get a study loan for her tuition ah.Chen Yu borrowed the only motorcycle in the village from village chief, huffing and puffing to get the certificate. When she returned home, she suddenly found that her courtyard was full of people.\u201cGuests?\u201d Chen Yu walked into the courtyard with a smile, thinking that these rich people came because of his old man\u2019s reputation and wanted to exorcise some spirits.\u201cAre you Chen Yu?\u201d a cold young man stared at Chen Yu with a pair of scrutinizing eyes.Chen Yu felt somewhat uncomfortable when he looked at her like that, so she stared back at him: \u201cIt\u2019s me, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe young man\u2019s expression instantly became dumbfounded, he was silent for a moment, and then spoke again: \u201cMy name is Chen Yang, your brother.\u201d\u201c...\u201dThinking about her unfortunate past history at that time, Chen Yu was in a mess. She always wanted to go to the capital for a look, so she struggled very hard for the past dozen of years to get a ticket for the train that could bring her to a whole new world, however, someone suddenly came and told her that her home was actually in the capital, what would she feel then?Loss ah! A huge loss ah!!!She remembered when she was in elementary school, how she woke up every day before dawn and walked through the mountains for two hours to go to school. She remembered how she would follow the old man to catch ghosts day and night every winter and summer vacation, while diligently finishing her homework. When she thought about college\u2019s entrance examination, she took an attitude of \u2018either succeed or die\u2019, the more she thought about her past, the more grievance she felt.Why did I bother with all of that\u2026?\u201cI told you a long time ago, you\u2019d naturally leave the village when the time comes.\u201d When leaving Damu Village, 'Paranormal fraud' old man gave the cloth bag that he always carried to Chen Yu.\u201cOld man\u2026\u201d Chen Yu who usually gave the old man a cold shoulder, hated to part with him at this time.\u201cDon\u2019t give me that fake cry.\u201d said the old man while putting the cloth bag in Chen Yu\u2019s arms, \u201cI can\u2019t use these things anymore, you can take them ah.\u201d\u201cYou still want me to inherit your mantel ah.\u201d Chen Yu said, looking at the things inside the cloth bag.\u201cYour dad is the mayor, how would I dare?\u201d The old man said in a bad mood, \u201cYou already lost two souls when I first brought you back, and because the loss of the souls happened for quite a long time, it can\u2019t be helped that there are some changes in your constitution. I let you practice metaphysics with me to enhance your physique, but I didn\u2019t expect that your talent of catching ghosts was actually quite good that you opened your yin-yang eyes by yourself ah.\u201d\u201cI first thought that it would be good as long as you can learn a few things, at least it can be a profitable trade.\u201dChen Yu looked at the old man suspiciously, as if she wanted to say,\u00a0you\u2019re still lying to me at such a time.\u201cWhen did I lie to you?\u201d the old man fumed with anger, \u201cWhen I was young, if someone wanted me to exorcise ghosts, if they didn\u2019t have at least a million yuan, even my face they wouldn\u2019t be able to see.\u201dChen Yu\u2019s face:\u00a0Since I can\u2019t verify it myself, you can just brag as you please.\u201cForget it, forget it.\u201d The old man gave up defending himself, \u201cYour father is the mayor, I estimate that you won\u2019t be lacking money in the future. It\u2019s just that, you have entered the (spiritual) door after all, the ghosts in the city are much more fierce than in the countryside, these things will give you some protection, it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t have to use them.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re actually willing to part with this compass ah.\u201dChen Yu pulled out a compass as big as her palm from the bag, she knew that the old man\u2019s most precious thing was exactly this compass.\u201cDon\u2019t drop it!\u201d The old man took a posture of wanting to get it back.Chen Yu immediately withdrew her hand.The old man clicked his tongue and continued to tell: \u201cThis compass is a spiritual tool, before you can use it skillfully, it would be best if you don\u2019t use it outside, else it\u2019d be easy to lose it.\u201d\u201cLose it? So it can run on its own legs ah.\u201d Chen Yu said with disregard.\u201cYou will know by then.\u201dThe old man still wanted to explain more things, but the girl\u2019s brother, Chen Yang, had came over. He politely said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but if we don\u2019t leave now, it will get dark before we can get out of the mountain.\u201dDamu Village was located deep in the mountains, and the mountain road that lead to the outside was meandering and complicated, moreover, it can only be traversed with motorcycle, cars just can\u2019t come in at all. This time, Chen Yang came to the village using a motorcycle, its speed wasn\u2019t faster than that of a car, so he\u2019s afraid that they will be trapped in the mountains if they were delayed on the road.The old man nodded, she looked towards Chen Yu for the last time and said, \u201cI also put a letter inside, you should look at it when you have the time.\u201d\u201cOld man\u2026\u201d Chen Yu hugged the old man who she had been living with for all these years.\u201cAlright, don\u2019t cry ah, go on.\u201d The old man\u2019s face was also full of reluctance.\u201cI\u2019ll come back to see you once summer vacation comes.\u201d Chen Yu promised him.--A day later, Chen Residence, at a certain imperial capital\u2019s army compound--\u201cMy name\u2019s Chen Jianxun, your father.\u201d Inside the man\u2019s steadfast appearance flashed a bit of gentleness, from his rigid face, it could be seen that it\u2019s not the expression that he often wears.\u201cMy\u2026 my name\u2019s Chen Yu.\u201d Chen Yu was unaware that she was somewhat anxious.\u201cYou should call me father.\u201d Mayor Chen reminded her.\u201c...father.\u201d Chen Yu hesitated before she squeezed out that word.\u201cEn.\u201d Mayor Chen nooded, and a smile finally bloomed from the stiff expression on his face, \u201cWelcome home.\u201dChen Yu shyly smiled back.\u201cI\u2019m your mother.\u201d From when Chen Yu entered the door, Mother Chen who kept on gazing at her daughter, couldn\u2019t wait anymore to introduce herself.\u201cMother.\u201d After calling her father, calling her mother became much easier to do.\u201cEmh.\u201d Mother Chen choked back a voice and her tears flowed down, holding her daughter inside her hands tightly.Chen Yu didn\u2019t expect that Mother Chen would cry so sadly and she immediately became flustered, not knowing how to comfort her, she could only ask for help from her brother who had been in contact with her for the longest time between them.\u201cMom, sister had been sitting on the plane for a whole day, she must be tired, let her go to rest for a while.\u201d In fact, the father and son of the Chen family somewhat couldn\u2019t bear to see Mother Chen\u2019s tears.\u201cRight, right, must be tired. Let your sister go upstairs to rest first, no, I\u2019ll take her up.\u201d Mother Chen immediately stopped crying and took her daughter upstairs to rest.After a brief introduction, Chen Yu, who was finally alone in the room, sighed in relief, but she didn\u2019t feel sleepy at all. She knew that the three people downstairs must be sitting together to discuss about her, but in fact, her head was also in a mess: Chen Yu didn\u2019t know how to get along with her three relatives that appeared so suddenly in her life.Chen Yu thought for a while, she remembered the letter mentioned by the old man, so she took the bag. Chen Yu placed the compass, cinnabar, and a pile of yellow paper from the bag on top of the table, and then saw the envelope mixed within yellow papers. When she was about to open it, the compass suddenly flashed.\u201cHuh?\u201d Chen Yu put the envelope in her hand and picked up the compass to check it, \u201cDidn\u2019t it flash just a while ago?\u201dAs if responding to Chen Yu, the compass flashed again as a burst of thin divine light spilled out from inside.\u201cDid you find something unclean?\u201d Chen Yu didn\u2019t feel any bad aura around her, nor seeing any ghosts floating about. Not only that, the feng shui in this compound was also very good, there\u2019s a touch of spiritual energy in the air.[T/L: Feng Shui is often related to the environment, placements of things, example: where to build a tomb, a house, a temple etc to get the most auspicious energy.]\u201cBuzz!\u201dThe compass suddenly shook and the pointer turned to point north. Chen Yu\u2019s eyes flickered, she immediately followed the direction of the pointer, walked to the window and looked straight outside.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing ah, what did you find?\u201d Chen Yu looked for a while but still found nothing.\u201cBuzz!\u201dThe compass in her hand shook uncontrollably, and because of a moment of carelessness, the compass left her hand and flew out the window.\u201cOh, dang\u2026it really can run.\u201d Chen Yu looked at the direction where the compass flew to, she hesitated by the window for ten seconds, and then jumped out to chase it.Chen Yu followed the aura of the compass all the way to the northernmost corner of the army compound. Noticing that the building was full of dense supernatural aura, Chen Yu knew why the compass ran to here. It turned out that instead of discovering bad things, the compass saw good things and ran to steal the aura.Chen Yu hesitated, then walked in front of the door before knocking it gently. Soon, the courtyard door opened, and a man in a western suit and leather jacket stood in front of her.It was the first time that Chen Yu had seen such a heavy evil energy inside a person\u2019 body and she frowned unconsciously.\u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d The man asked.\u201cThat, I\u2019m sorry ah, I dropped something in your yard, can I go in and pick it up?\u201d Chen Yu asked with a smile.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here that\u2019s yours.\u201d The man shut the door with a clatter.\u201c...\u201d Chen Yu continued to knock on the door.The one who opened the door was still the man just now. When he saw Chen Yu, he frowned and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI really dropped something here, a compass, about this big, it fell in just now, please let me come in to find it. If you\u2019re worried, you can just follow me. \u201cChen Yu explained again.\u201cPlease leave!\u201d The man said impatiently and closed the door again.Chen Yu looked at the time, and found out that it was soon the time for dinner. She had to rush back before dinner, she couldn\u2019t just disappear on her first day meeting her family ah.Chen Yu circled around the yard, found a place without anyone around, and mouthed a mantra silently. She just had no alternative ah. She rolled up her sleeves, and with a turn of her body, she climbed the wall and entered the yard. Inside, following the smell of the compass, she quickly found it lying behind a stone while absorbing the supernatural aura around. After picking it up, she wanted to walk away so she turned around only to face two revolvers right in front of her.Chen Yu very consciously raised her two hands up.Her heart thought that what the old man said was right, the city was very dangerous.Inside the living room across the wall, Lou Ming glanced outside the door and asked, \u201cWhat happened outside?\u201d\u201cSomeone climbed the wall and entered in.\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s assistant, He Qi, reported.Lou Ming was somewhat surprised as he asked, \u201cWhich side\u2019s person?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Mayor Chen\u2019s daughter who had just been retrieved, Chen Yu.\u201d He Qi answered.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: Please Call Me Xishi\u201cThe little girl who was lost from Chen family ten years ago?\u201d Lou Ming raised his eyebrows in surprise.\u201cShe was abducted and sold by traffickers.\u201d In order to protect Lou Ming\u2019s safety, He Qi investigated everyone who had entered and exited the compound, even Chen Yu, who had just returned to the Chen family, \u201cShe was sold to a remote mountain village in Qingmu province, young master Chen just picked her up two days ago.\u201d\u201cShe had been abducted?\u201d Lou Ming frowned unconsciously, if one asked him which kind of people were the most disgusting in the world, the trafficker must be one of them.Lou Ming put down the half-read magazine in his hand, stood up, walked to the window and lifted the curtain. He only saw a particularly thin figure, hair tied with a loose ponytail, while she was standing with her hands raised.\u201cI\u2026 I really came here to pick something up, you see, the thing is still in my hand, I\u2026 I\u2019m really not a bad person.\u201d Chen Yu shivered while trying to explain as best as she can.She\u2019d grown so big, she also had seen a lot of ghosts, but she had never seen a gun before ah, this was frightening people to death ah,\u00a0sob sob\u2026Lou Ming frowned, \u201cTell them to put down their guns, don\u2019t frighten a little girl.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d He Qi said a few words to his receiver and the two guards outside immediately put their hands down. At that time, the monitoring room also checked the video recording within the past half an hour and found that an unknown object actually fell into the yard ten minutes ago, it was the compass that Chen Yu held in her hand.\u201cHave you checked properly?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cYes, we\u2019ve checked it properly, miss Chen did come in to pick up the thing.\u201d He Qi replied.\u201cThen let her go back.\u201d Lou Ming put the curtain down and sat back on the sofa again.\u201cYes, I will let Zhang Wu send her back.\u201d He Qi said as he picked up the receiver again, wanting to give more instruction.\u201cNo need for that, just send her out of the yard and let her go home.\u201d Lou Ming thought something and said this sentence.\u201cThird young master, I think that it\u2019s better to let Mayor Chen know about this matter.\u201d He Qi reminded, after all, this house was a restricted area in the military compound. Chen Yu broke in for no reason this time, they can still let her out, but she won\u2019t be so lucky next time.\u201cShe was kidnapped when she was a child, and now that she just returned to this new environment, she must be feeling insecure. If you let someone to send her back, Mayor Chen would know that she made trouble and the little girl would feel more uncomfortable at home.\u201d Lou Ming said, \u201cWhat\u2019s more, she was scared by you just now, I estimate that she won\u2019t come back again in the future.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d He Qi hesitated, but finally decided to follow Third young master\u2019s instruction.After He Qi finished assigning the task to his subordinate, he saw that there was no water left in the Third young master\u2019s cup, so he carried the kettle and added some more water.\u201cHow high is the courtyard wall?\u201d Lou Ming asked all of a sudden.He Qi blanked for a while before responding quickly, \u201c290 centimeters.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that tall ah.\u201d Lou Ming smiled, \u201cThat little girl has a good skill.\u201dDidn\u2019t know if it was an illusion, but He Qi felt that Third young master Lou had a good impression towards the young daughter of the Chen family. His guess was soon confirmed.When she was pointed with guns, Chen Yu felt that if she didn\u2019t explain herself there, she would at least get a layer of her skin shed. So she shouted that her father was the Mayor, fight for an opportunity, and because of that, the other party only warned her and let her free.Chen Yu covered her small heart with her hand for three seconds just to make sure that she\u2019s still alive before running back to her house.She skillfully climbed over the wall and tree, and returned to her bedroom on the second floor. After sitting down for a while, a knock rang from the door.\u201cW-who?\u201d Chen Yu asked, still full of guilt.\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Chen Yang\u2019s voice came from outside.\u201cO\u2026 oh.\u201d Chen Yu hurriedly stood up to open the door, and smiled after looking at her own brother.Chen Yang saw her sister\u2019s head full of sweat, he couldn\u2019t help but wondered, \u201cHow come you\u2019re sweating?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Chen Yu raised her hands in panic and wiped the sweat on her face, she dryly smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 to hot.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t turned on the AC?\u201d Chen Yang noticed that Chen Yu\u2019s room was very hot at this moment. The weather in August was the hottest time in the capital, and even though it\u2019s already evening, it was still very hot.Chen Yang walked into the room and picked up the remote control to help Chen Yu turn on the AC. He knew that many children in the countryside were very economical after coming to the city, so he thought that Chen Yu was also reluctant to turn on the AC for this same reason. He wanted to say something, but was afraid of hurting his sister\u2019s self-esteem. After contemplating for a while, he decided to say, \u201cSummer in the city is very hot, it\u2019s best to turn on the AC when you\u2019re inside the house, otherwise we would worry if you get a heatstroke.\u201d\u201cEn, en, I know.\u201d Chen Yu didn\u2019t even notice her brother\u2019s careful attention for her glass heart.\u201cThen, go and take a bath, we\u2019ll eat dinner in a bit.\u201d Chen Yang put down the remote control.\u201cOkay.\u201dWaiting until Chen Yang walked out, Chen Yu sighed and leaned against the door, patting her small chest while secretly whispering \u2018It\u2019s a close call\u2019.After Chen Yu took a bath, changed her clothes and went downstairs, the food in the kitchen was almost ready too. Because they wanted to give a welcome dinner to Chen Yu, the Chen family who usually only had simple meals on the weekday, rarely made a table full of dishes today. During dinner, Mother Chen kept on picking dishes to Chen Yu\u2019s bowl, Chen Yu can\u2019t refuse easily, so she could only eat until her stomach almost bursting.\u201cAfter two days I\u2019ll send someone to change your residence\u2019s registration, do you want to change your name?\u201d Mayor Chen asked.\u201cChange name? Why should I change my name?\u201d Chen Yu tilted her head in puzzlement.\u201cThen it won\u2019t be changed, let\u2019s still call you Chen Yu.\u201d Although Mayor Chen wanted to keep the name she saved for her daughter, but, after all, Chen Yu had already used to this name and it was inconvenient to change it.After hearing this, Mother Chen couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWho helped you get this name? Why is it called Chen Yu [fish], was it because you like eating fish as a child?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Chen Yu shook her head, \u201cMy name is the old man\u2019s\u2026\u00a0cough\u2026grandpa\u2019s choice. It was supposed to be picked from the \u2018prince\u2019 side character that means \u2018fine jade\u2019. But when I went to the village register, the village head uncle made a mistake and wrote it as fish from carp fish. When grandpa found out, the account had already been registered, and grandpa was too lazy to change it so he just use it until now.\u201d[T/N: Chen Yu\u2019s Yu written as fish\u9c7c whereas prince\u738b\u5b50\u2019s side character: \u745c is from\u7f8e\u7389, see the similarity between \u738b (wang) and \u7389 (yu), so it\u2019s supposed to be \u9648\u7389 rather than\u9648\u9c7c]\u201cFish from \u2018carp fish\u2019 is also very good, it sounds very lively oh.\u201d Mother Chen smiled.Mayor Chen also nodded with a smile.\u201cDo you think it\u2019s lively?\u201d A trace of doubt flashed in Chen Yu\u2019s eyes, \u201cDo you have other associative connection?\u201d\u201cAssociative connection?\u201d Mother Chen glanced to her husband and son, but the two people were also very confused.\u201cChen Yu \u9648\u9c7c, Chen Yu \u6df1\u9c7c.\u201d Chen Yu reminded them, \u201cThe four ancient beauties.\u201d\u201cXishi?\u201d Chen Yang reacted the fastest.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Chen Yu\u2019 expression was \u2018I knew you guys can guess it\u2019, \u201cBecause of this, my classmate didn\u2019t call my name when I was in school, they all like to call me Xishi or Meiren, you can also call me this way.\u201d[T/N: a story about the four greatest ancient beauties (Meiren = beautiful person), one of them was called Xishi, who\u2019s so beautiful that when she went to the stream, the fish would stare endlessly at her face, forgot how to swim, and sink to the depths of the water, thus the idiom \u6c89(sink)\u9c7c (fish) \u843d\u96c1 ]\u201c...\u201d The three people of the Chen family fell into a strange silence once again, the experienced Father Chen reacted the fastest and he quickly adjusted his state of mind, \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting nickname, then we\u2019ll also call you Xishi in the future.\u201dChen Yang\u2019s hand that was holding chopsticks shivered, he glanced at this blackened sister of hers. Even if she\u2019s his own little sister, but Chen Yang still can\u2019t ignore his conscience and persuade himself that this is a beauty. He looked at Mayor Chen silently, as if to ask, \u2018are you sure that calling her Xishi isn\u2019t ironic?\u2019[Panda: Okay, I know some of you guys might be offended by this, I personally don\u2019t like this too, but Chinese people have this beauty standard that was rooted from way back then that \u2018white skin is beautiful\u2019, it\u2019s just because dark-skinned people usually meant that they are peasants who have to work under the sun, while white-skinned people meant nobles who usually stay indoor. Not to mention Chinese people do tend to be suitable with fair skin rather than darker skin. Please read this with a grain of salt.]\u201cAlright then.\u201d Chen Yu said happily.Mother Chen who originally still wanted to say something, looked at how her daughter that seemed to be very happy, and finally decided to say nothing but put a piece of ribs in her daughter\u2019s bowl and said, \u201cXi\u2026 Xishi, eat this piece of ribs.\u201d\u201cThank you, mother.\u201d Chen Yu raised her head and smiled genially to express her gratitude.Mother Chen looked at her black daughter, her eyes became red, she secretly decided to take her daughter out tomorrow for a full set of beauty treatment and strive to get her daughter closer to the path of beauty as soon as possible.When the several people were eating dinner, Aunt Liu, the nanny, suddenly walked in and said, \u201cMaster, Madam, someone came to give present for the young lady.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Mayor Chen asked doubtfully.\u201cIt seems to be the Lou family\u2019s Third young master.\u201d Aunt Liu said.\u201cXi\u2026 sister, do you know Lou Third young master?\u201d Chen Yang really can\u2019t call out \u2018Xishi\u2019.\u201cNo?\u201d Chen Yu, who was drinking soup, shook her head.\u201cThen why did Lou Third young master send someone to give you a present?\u201d Chen Yang asked.Chen Yu was baffled too.\u201cLet\u2019s go and see.\u201dMayor Chen took the lead and walked toward the living room. Chen Yu followed her mother, and when she stepped inside the living room, she immediately sensed a familiar evil aura, and she whispered under her breath \u2018shoot!\u2019. As soon as she looked up, she saw a man in a uniform exactly the same as the one she saw in the small building this afternoon.Does heaven wants to kill me?!What to do, what to do, how should I explain this? How did I go out, why did I go out, I obviously was sleeping in my room, how could my thing fell into someone else\u2019 yard ah?\u00a0The more Chen Yu thought, the more she couldn\u2019t find any words to explain, as if she had nothing left to live for, she looked at He Qi in the center of the living room. No wonder he let her go so easily this afternoon, it turned out he wanted to settle the scores at an opportune moment.He Qi naturally also noticed the change in Chen Yu\u2019s expression, he smiled secretly, thinking what Third young master guessed was right, this little girl was really afraid that Mayor Chen would know of her little adventure.\u201cAssistant He, you\u2019re here.\u201d Mayor Chen recognized the other party as assistant He Qi who\u2019s always around Third young master.\u201cMayor Chen, this is the gift prepared by Third young master for the young lady.\u201d He Qi said as he handed the delicately wrapped teddy bear doll in his hand.\u201cThis is?\u201d Mayor Chen was a little dumbfounded as he asked, \u201cHow come Third young master suddenly think of giving a present to my daughter?\u201d\u201cThird young master said that he had promised to give young lady Chen a gift when she was still very young. It was only later that Miss Chen was lost, and although the gift had been bought, it can\u2019t be delivered anymore. Today, Third young master accidentally heard that Miss Chen had been found, so he remembered about this matter again, thus sending me to especially deliver the gift. This can be considered as him fulfilling his promise to Miss Chen.\u201d He Qi turned around and looked at the dumbfounded Chen Yu, \u201cMiss Chen, Third young master said that the gift is a bit old after 15 years, hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Chen Yu stuttered nervously.\u201cThen, please accept it.\u201d He Qi smiled and handed the gift to Chen Yu.Chen Yu stretched out her hand and looked nervously to He Qi, afraid that the man would say something else.\u201cSince the gift has been delivered, then I won\u2019t disturb you any longer.\u201d He Qi took his leave.\u201cPlease pass my thanks to Third young master.\u201d Mayor Chen didn\u2019t expect that Lou Ming would remember what happened 15 years ago, furthermore, he sent the gift at the very first day his daughter returned home, so he immediately felt moved.\u201cI will definitely pass it.\u201d He Qi nodded, then turned around, wanting to depart.Chen Yu saw that he was really just coming to send her a gift so she felt pleasantly surprised. Her impression of the Third young master in that building became much better, and she thought what to do to express her gratitude, so she called out to He Qi, \u201cYou\u2026 wait a bit, I-I have a return gift to give Third young master.\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she didn\u2019t wait for the other\u2019 reaction before she ran up the stairs while cuddling the bear, and soon, she came back empty-handed. She ran to He Qi and unfolded her right hand, revealing a piece of yellow paper that was folded as a paper crane.He Qi was puzzled as he looked at Chen Yu.Chen Yu explained, \u201cThis is a safety talisman, which could be used to keep you safe if you bring it with you, although\u2026 the packaging is a little bad, but the effect is still good.\u201dCan this still be counted as packaged?\u00a0This was the thought of everyone present.\u201cI will pass it to Third young master.\u201d He Qi took the paper crane and put it carefully inside his pocket, then once again said his goodbye before leaving.He Qi quickly returned to the small building and knocked on the study door.\u201cHave you sent the present?\u201d Lou Ming asked while drawing something with his pen without looking up.\u201cDelivered, the other party also sent a return gift.\u201d He Qi said as he took out the paper crane out of his pocket and put it on his palm.When he heard about the return gift, Lou Ming raised his head in surprise, his eyes fell on the yellow paper crane with a frown.\u201cMiss Chen said that this is a safety talisman, although the packaging is a little bit lacking, but the effect is still good.\u201d He Qi said with a smile in his eyes.\u201cReally?\u201d Lou Ming stretched out two fingers to pinch the little crane paper in front of his eyes, after he pulled the wings, he found the little words on it, \u201cThank you.\u201dThe corners of Lou Ming\u2019s mouth was slightly raised, he thought that this little girl was quite polite. However, this yellow paper was indeed similar to the rune paper used to draw incantations, and the incantation style really resembled the one given to him by the Great master Mao.\u201cAre you going to change shifts?\u201d Lou Ming heard the movements outside.\u201cYes, Third young master, see you again next week.\u201d He Qi respectfully gave a salute before turning around and departed from the study room.Ten hours, it looked like the evil aura on his body became even worse, Lou Ming unconsciously showed a bitter smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: New Money Making SkillAlthough Lou Ming also lived in this military compound, but for some special reasons, he hardly has any contact with people around him, and the people around him would also deliberately avoid Lou Ming. And because of this reason, Mayor Chen was so surprised when He Qi came over to send a gift this evening.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that someone other than us would remember about our daughter after so many years.\u201d Mother Chen said quite emotionally.\u201cYes, Third young master Lou has a heart too.\u201d Mayor Chen nodded in agreement.\u201cSister had seen Third young master Lou when she was a child?\u201d Chen Yang asked curiously, knowing that even though he grew up here, but he only saw Lou Ming a few times.\u201cSince Third young master Lou said so, then it must be true.\u201d Mother Chen recalled, \u201cAfter all, he wasn\u2019t like this now ten plus years ago. When Lou family held a banquet, Third young master Lou also attended. One day, I took your sister to Minister Lou\u2019s birthday banquet, so they must have met at that time.\u201d\u201cLook like this now? What did he look like?\u201d Chen Yang asked with curiosity after hearing this.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Mother Chen obviously didn\u2019t want to talk about this, she smiled and asked Chen Yu, \u201cIs your stomach full? Do you want to eat some more?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d Chen Yu nodded, she can\u2019t help but feel some curiosity as she continued to ask, \u201cThat\u2019s right, mom, where does Third young master Lou lives in? Is it also in the compound?\u201d\u201cWhat are you gonna do, asking about this?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t he give me a present? I want to thank him personally tomorrow.\u201d Chen Yu smiled.\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d This time, Mayor Chen forbid her, \u201cThird young master Lou doesn\u2019t like people disturbing him.\u201d\u201cYes, your dad\u2019s right, Third young master Lou really doesn\u2019t like people disturbing him.\u201d Mother Chen quickly echoed.\u201cOh.\u201d Chen Yu thoughtfully responded, but her mind uncontrollably flashed with the pictures of when she was inside the Lou family\u2019s courtyard. The spiritual energy that filled the house, those dozens of men with guns, the husky fellow whose covered with evil energy, even if she only used her toes to think, she still can see that there\u2019s some problems there.However, even though Chen Yu was curious, but she didn\u2019t actually has the intention to explore anything. After all, the feeling of being pointed by guns wasn\u2019t at all good.After that, the few people chatted for a while, mainly because Mother Chen was asking her daughter about her life situation over the years. Chen Yu had to answer all of the questions, but for the most part, she chose to answer that it\u2019s all good. They all chatted until more than ten o\u2019clock before going back to their own room to sleep.Chen Yu returned to her room, took the linen bag on the side and searched for the cinnabar, paper talisman and things similar to those, and then took out the letter that the old man wrote for her, earnestly reading it while sitting on the bed.[Girl, Grandpa used to tell you that my skill is very profitable, but you always don\u2019t believe me. However, that time you\u2019re living in Damu Village, grandpa felt that it didn\u2019t matter if you believe it or not so I didn\u2019t prove anything to you. But now that you have gone to the Imperial Capital, grandpa must solemnly declare once again that grandpa\u2019s ability is really profitable!]\u201cIt\u2019s not easy writing this letter but you\u2019re still writing this kind of unreliable thing.\u201d Chen Yu looked at the huge exclamation mark and couldn\u2019t help but grumble.[Before, when I took you to catch ghosts in the towns and villages around Damu Village, it was basically voluntary labor, and the main purpose was to let you learn from it. If you really follow grandpa\u2019s previous price standard, they can\u2019t even see my face if they don\u2019t prepare at least several millions of yuan.][I know you don\u2019t believe it, so grandpa prepared a penguin number for you (37829, password: zhuoguishi)][Penguin is a Tencent\u2019s operation platform]After seeing that, Chen Yu really followed and logged into the penguin number, she frowned and continued to read the rest.[This penguin number is the small portion of what grandpa have when I mixed inside the Jianghu. I won\u2019t give you the big one, afraid that it would scare others. There are no friends connected to this penguin number, the only use is to connect to a group of Heavenly Teachers. When you\u2019re free, take a look at the information inside and learn a lot of useful things. When you don\u2019t have money, you can just take an order an earn some pocket money yourself.]\u201cIs this real or not?\u201d Chen Yu lowered her head and continued reading the letter.[After you somewhat grasped this group of ghost catching business, if you think you\u2019re competent, grandpa wish that you can do something for Damu Village through the skills that grandpa had taught you and build a good road for them.]Before seeing the last sentence, Chen Yu always thought that this was the 'Supernatural fraud' Old man\u2019s way of joking with her. But when she saw the Old man asked her to help the villagers of Damu Village to build a road, Chen Yu suddenly somewhat believed it.It\u2019s the wish of the several generations of Damu Village\u2019s villagers to build a road that can lead to the mountains. Although the 'Supernatural fraud' Old man was really weird in normal days, but he wouldn\u2019t joke about this kind of thing.\u201cWhat are you reading books for? If you learn my skills properly, you can pay for the road construction by yourself alone.\u201dChen Yu suddenly remembered this one sentence that the Old man said to her, and her whole person jumped out of the bed at once, ran barefoot to the desk, turned on the computer neatly, entered the account\u2019s password that the Old man gave her, and finally, the mouse fell on the login button. At this time, Chen Yu took a deep breath and clicked heavily.\u201cDing ding.\u201dThe system\u2019s crisp prompt sounded, Chen Yu looked at the group message sign flashing in the lower right corner incredulously before taking a breath.This penguin account really can be used?No way, Chen Yu, you\u2019re too excited, what\u2019s strange with an active penguin account? Let\u2019s observe a bit more.Chen Yu first checked the information on the penguin account and she found out that the old man didn\u2019t exaggerate at all. This turned out to be an empty account with no friend except for a group called, \u2018Gods and Ghosts Don't Ask\u2019. Incidentally, the name given to this small account by the old man was \u2018I\u2019m Small Account\u2019.[T/N: Xiaohao \u5c0f\u53f7 is a small / subsidiary account outside of the main account]Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but rolled her eyes at this name. She reached out to open the group chat window and began to silently pried at the screen.Cassia Seed: \u2018Feng Huo, how about selling me two intermediate exorcism talisman for a hundred thousand per sheet?\u2019Taoist Priest Feng Huo: \u2018A hundred thousand a sheet? How much do you have? Give me all of them, I\u2019ll buy!\u2019Cassia Seed: \u2018You sh*t, if I can draw it, why would I ask you?\u2019Taoist Priest Feng Huo: \u2018One hundred was the old price at ten years ago, are you sincere in buying ah? Two hundred one sheet, fixed price.\u2019Cassia Seed: \u2018We\u2019ve known each other for so many years, can\u2019t you give a friendship price?\u2019An intermediate exorcism talisman for two hundred thousand?\u00a0Chen Yu looked at the linen bag she threw aside casually, and there were dozens of intermediate exorcism talismans.\u00a0If one sheet worth 200 thousand, then how much all of that worth?No way, calm down, calm down, how could there be such a convenient thing? This kind of rune paper isn\u2019t valuable, Old man only casually painted on them ah. The last time I went out to exorcise ghosts and used this intermediate talisman, Old man only got a hundred yuan in return.Chen Yu shook her head and continued to quietly peeked at the screen, until a netizen named March Floating Rain spoke and Chen Yu began to be calm again.March Floating Rain: \u2018Anyone in the Imperial Capital?\u2019Cassia Seed: \u2018Why?\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Are you in the Capital? Then, can you help me? I picked up a business two days ago and was going to exorcise ghosts in the newly developed Riverside Park at the Hu\u2019an Area, but I suddenly have some matter to do so I can\u2019t go there anymore. If anyone of you can go there for me, I can pay a million.\u2019A million??\u00a0Chen Yu felt her adrenaline began to soar high.Cassia Seed: \u2018How many years of cultivation?\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018I tread on it once a bit, about a hundred years of cultivation.\u2019Cassia Seed: 'One hundred years of cultivation for a million, not worth it, not going.\u2019March Floating Rain: 'Are there any other brothers in the group that\u2019s free? I can make an advance payment of 500 thousand yuan and you can just finish it before next month.'Five hundred thousand advance payment? Advance payment, doesn\u2019t it mean that you give the money first?Chen Yu knew that this matter wasn\u2019t credible, but the temptation of \u2018advance payment\u2019 was too great, and there should be no loss for her to just give her card number.Chen Yu bit his finger and thought for two minutes, then decisively opened the dialog box to March Floating Rain, and the two chatted privately.I\u2019m Small Account: \u2018One million? You can pay me in advance?\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Yes, brother, do you want to take it?\u2019I\u2019m Small Account: \u2018Still thinking.\u2019March Floating Rain: Brother, give me your account number, I\u2019ll transfer the money to you right now.\u2019This enthusiastic?\u00a0Chen Yu blinked and then sent her bank account number, thinking that since there\u2019s not even a cent inside her bank, so she can\u2019t be cheated on anyway.One minute later.March Floating Rain: \u2018Brother, I\u2019ve sent the money, you can contact me again once the task is finished and I\u2019ll send the rest of the payment.\u2019\u2018Ding dong\u2019Almost as soon as the other party\u2019s message came in, Chen Yu\u2019s phone received a text message. Chen Yu then opened her phone and read the message: (Qingmu Bank. Your account 62***888 has received a deposit of 500,000 yuan at 22:50, 26th, total balance: 500,000 yuan).It couldn\u2019t be a scam message, right?\u00a0Chen Yu held the phone in her one hand and her bank card in another hand, trying to control her desire to jump out the window and find an ATM to check the balance.Regardless of whether it\u2019s true or not, Chen Yu couldn\u2019t sleep well at night because of this. When she woke up in the morning the next day, she sat in the family\u2019s dining room with dark eyes, fortunately, because of her dark complexion, other people didn\u2019t find out about it.\u201cXi\u2026 Shishi ah, did you sleep well last night?\u201d Mother Chen felt that \u2018Xi Shi\u2019 was a bit too much, so she changed it to \u2018Shishi\u2019 automatically.\u201cVery good.\u201d Chen Yu replied.\u201cIt\u2019s good then, it\u2019s good.\u201d Mother Chen smiled and added a bun for her daughter, \u201cEat more, then you\u2019ll have the strength to go shopping with mom.\u201d\u201cMom also eat more.\u201d Chen Yu also clipped a bun for Mother Chen.Mother Chen immediately beamed with joy.After breakfast, Mayor Chen went for work, Chen Yang went out with his classmate to play basketball while Chen Yu naturally followed Mother Chen to the mall.Mother Chen seemed to want to spend all the money she hadn\u2019t paid her daughter for the past 15 years. After entering the mall, she became out of control, as long as she thought that something could be used for her daughter, she would immediately buy it all. At the end of their shopping spree, when Chen Yu was breathing heavily as she almost broke her hands and feet for carrying the mountainous bags, Mother Chen finally took Chen Yu into a beauty center, and let the beautician give her daughter a set of full body whitening package.\u201cShishi, Mother will accompany you to get some beauty treatment every weekend afterwards.\u201d Mother Chen signed the POS receipt at the cashier.When Chen Yu saw the POS receipt, she remembered the bank card that had been stuck inside her pocket while she walked with Mother Chen for a day. Because Chen Yu was rushed and dazed almost all of today, she hadn\u2019t found the opportunity to go to an ATM and check her balance. While hesitating to find an excuse to go out, a beautician in a pink uniform came out of the room and said, \u201cMrs. Chen, Ms. Chen, the room is ready, we can start with the beauty treatment.\u201d\u201cShishi, let\u2019s go.\u201d Mother Chen went in as she pulled her daughter inside.\u201cMom, you go inside first, I want to go to the toilet first.\u201d Chen Yu said with a bit of embarrassment.\u201cOkay, then mom will go to change clothes first.\u201d Mother Chen also didn\u2019t think much and followed the beautician to the room.Chen Yu waited for Mother Chen to enter the room before turning around and walked out. The beauty consultant at the door saw her and reminded her while smiling, \u201cMs. Chen, the store has toilets too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I like the one outside.\u201d After she said this, she didn\u2019t wait for the other\u2019 reaction before she trot all the way to the elevator right to the first floor. Chen Yu remembered seeing a bank outside the mall when she came here in the morning.Chen Yu found an empty ATM machine, closed the door, inserted the card, entered her password and clicked to check on her balance.\u2026Chen Yu froze at the monitor, blinked and then blinked again, and then read the Arabic numerals before reading the Chinese letters again. She still can\u2019t believe that there were really half a million in her card. In order to ensure that the money was really her own, Chen Yu decided to take a hundred yuan for a try.\u201cPlease take out your cash and receipt.\u201dChen Yu gazed at the red hot freshly baked Grandpa Mao in her hand, and then looked at the balance of 499,900 in the monitor\u2026 and knocked her head on the machine.Making money has become so easy, why do I suddenly begin to doubt how people handle their lives all this time?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: First BusinessIn people\u2019s perception, a city was always noisy, there were too many people, too many cars and too many things. But for Chen Yu, who had spent two nights in the capital city, felt that the city at night was especially quiet. There was almost no living thing in the carefully pruned lawn, the few cicadas that sounded occasionally didn\u2019t have the sound like the crickets in the grass outside of Damu Village.Chen Yu turned on a small desk lamp, carrying the linen bag given to her by the Old man, then quietly pushed the window and jumped down. It was already twelve o\u2019clock at night, the lights on \u00a0Father and Mother Chen\u2019s room next to hers had already been turned off for two hours, while Chen Yang\u2019s room at the far left of the second floor was also turned off half an hour ago.Chen Yu flipped out to the yard skillfully, bringing with her the smart phone that Mother Chen had just bought for her today, locking onto the place that she was going to go to tonight.\u201cThirty five kilometers?\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help exclaimed, \u201cWon\u2019t it be dawn when I come back later?\u201dChen Yu decisively dismissed her intention to walk and stopped a taxi on the roadside. Now that there was a new money-making skill, the way to spend money should also keep up with progression ah.There were only a few cars at night so the speed was very fast. In less than forty minutes, the taxi stopped at the gate of Riverside Park. When getting off, the kind taxi driver saw that Chen Yu was only a little girl, coming to this place in the middle of the night, so he couldn\u2019t help reminding her, \u201cStudent, this place is very remote, do you really want to get off here?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, thank you, mister.\u201d Chen Yu said and handed over a hundred yuan.\u201cStudent, it\u2019s not easy to get a taxi near here, how long are you going to spend here? Do you want me to wait for you?\u201d The driver said while looking for a change to give to Chen Yu.\u201cThere\u2019s no need, mister. I also don\u2019t know when I would come out, thank you for your concern.\u201d Chen Yu thanked.\u201cThen, okay, be careful.\u201d The driver saw that this little girl insisted and that it\u2019s hard to persuade her.\u00a0These young\u2019uns nowadays, really makes parents worry.Waiting until the taxi turned on the junction and can\u2019t be seen anymore, Chen Yu then turned around and walked into the park\u2019s gate. Riverside Park was the newly developed park that was located on the lakeside, it hasn\u2019t been opened to the public yet. The tall iron gate was secured by an iron chain, so Chen Yu looked up at the height and searched for a better place to put her foot on before jumping two or three times and entered the park.After entering the park, Chen Yu flipped the compass out of her bag, looking at the pointer of the compass that turned around before finally pointing to the southwest.Looks like the goal is right there.After determining the direction, Chen Yu closed the compass and turned on the flashlight function of her new phone. While lamenting of the multi-function of the smart phone, she casually walked to the pointed direction.After walking for about ten minutes, Chen Yu faintly felt a bit of ghostly aura, but she didn\u2019t stop or look around in alert. She instead quietly walked along the stone path inside the bamboo forest, looking like she didn\u2019t find anything yet.Halfway through, Chen Yu found that there\u2019s a small pavilion in the center of the bamboo forest that was dedicated for tourists. Pretending that she was tired, Chen Yu walked over to find a place to sit down before taking out her phone and played a Penguin card game.\u201cLoot the landlord, I\u2019ll loot.\u201d\u201cQuickly, I\u2019m already waiting until all my flowers withered ah.\u201d\u201cThe king exploded!\u201dJust after Chen Yu played three to four rounds with keen interest, a cold voice suddenly sounded beside her ear, \u201cYour card isn\u2019t good.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t grab the landlord.\u201d Chen Yu nodded in agreement as she bowed her head and continued fighting the landlord.\u201c...\u201d The icy voice waited silently for a while, looking at Chen Yu finishing another round, Chen Yu actually planned to continue playing again, so she can\u2019t help but asked, \u201cThere\u2019s another people that appeared beside you suddenly, but you don\u2019t lift your head up to see?\u201d\u201cOf course one have to look up if there\u2019s another people, but you\u2019re not \u2018people\u2019 ah.\u201d Chen Yu said as she pulled out a card.The female ghost who was waiting to see the horrified expression of this human girl, suddenly changed her face. Her pale and beautiful face became hideous, her nails rapidly lengthened, and she raised her hand to clutch Chen Yu\u2019s neck.Chen Yu pulled out an expelling talisman from her pocket, and attached it to the female ghost\u2019s hand that was reaching out to her. The paper issued out a green flame when it touched the ghost\u2019s hand, immediately accompanied by a shriek while it scorched the ghost\u2019s originally white palm.\u201cWho are you?!\u201d the female ghost retreated 5 meters away and looked at Chen Yu cautiously.Chen Yu clicked the pause button in the game and put down her phone. She looked up and began to think of her goal tonight. This was a ghost who died prematurely, should be less than 20 years old, her blood red eyes can\u2019t cover her original beautiful face, Chen Yu thought she must be a beauty before her death.\u201cI\u2019m an exorcist, you can call me Xishi.\u201d Chen Yu replied.The female ghost had lived for nineteen years and died for a hundred years, but she had never seen such a blind confidence in a girl, making her couldn\u2019t control the twitch on the edges of her mouth.\u201cFrom the first time I started exorcising ghosts, my grandpa had set out two rules for me.\u201d Chen Yu looked at the female ghost and stretched out her two fingers, \u201cOne, exorcism is absolutely not free, even if it\u2019s just a coin, I still have to receive it. After all, exorcising ghosts is dangerous, right?\u201dThe female ghost\u2019s face looked like she suffered from constipation after hearing her words.\u201cSecondly, when exorcising evil spirits, just directly break them up to prevent death from talking too much.\u201d Chen Yu raised her eyebrows and smiled, \u201cBut you still have the patience to play a game with me, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an evil spirit, so why don\u2019t we have a talk?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to talk about?\u201d The female ghost looked at Chen Yu defensively. She had been on this site for a hundred years, and it wasn\u2019t that she had never met Taoist Priest or Heavenly Teacher who wanted to clean her away, but it was her first time to see one as young as Chen Yu. However, after the brief fight just now, the female ghost didn\u2019t dare to look down on the little girl called 'Xishi' in front of her.\u201cDo you want to reincarnate yourself, or do you want to be beaten by me\u2026 and reincarnate?\u201d Chen Yu asked sincerely.\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 seeking death!\u201d The female ghost was suddenly irritated as the yin energy around her rose up. The dense yin covered the moonlight that trickled in from the crevices of the bamboo forest. In the dark space, the figure of the female ghost was no longer visible, and only the faint light of the phone screen was still stubbornly flashing.\u201cIt seems that I still have to get to work.\u201d Chen Yu raised her hand as she wanted to get the intermediate expelling talisman, but she suddenly remembered that a sheet of this talisman worth 200 thousand, so she immediately shifted her target and took six primary level talismans instead.\u201cOpen.\u201d Chen Yu pointed at the center of her eyebrows, opening the seal on her Yin Yang eyes. When she opened her eyes again, Chen Yu saw the dark black yin fluttering like mist.Chen Yu accurately found the ghost position from there, and she flung her hand to throw out the six talismans. They converged into a circle in the air one meter before Chen Yu, as they shined with divine light, along with the chanting of the mantra, they swiftly shrinked and bound the female ghost on the spot.The female ghost who was originally hidden inside the yin energy and wanted to stealthily attack Chen Yu, was suddenly chained by the talismans. She fell down from the air and struggled desperately in vain. The aura flashed one after another, and the female ghost\u2019s long nails shrank slowly to a normal length, while the blood-red eyes also gradually turned back into black and white.\u201cRelease me! I don\u2019t want to be reborn!\u201d The female ghost struggled like a madwoman.\u201cI see that although you have quite a lot of Yin, but you didn\u2019t kill that much. Reform well in the underworld, you still have a chance to rebirth as a good baby.\u201d Chen Yu consoled her.\u201cI don\u2019t want to reincarnate, I don\u2019t want to reincarnate!\u201dChen Yu was already familiar with this situation. She took out the compass from the bag around her waist, raised her hand, threw it into the air and said, \u201cConsidering your worth of one million, I\u2019ll personally open the gate for you.\u201dThere were two main methods for driving out ghosts, one was to deliver the ghost to the Underworld and let the Underworld handle the rest, while the other was to break the ghost directly, but their soul will disappear completely from the three realms after being scattered like this.However, there were two methods to send them to the Underworld. The first was to notify the errand demon to take the ghost itself, in this way, it would be equivalent to the arrest of a fugitive prisoner. The second method was to open the gate to the Underworld and let the exorcist send the ghost directly. In this way, when the ghost pass the gate, they can be purified by the exorcist\u2019s spiritual energy. This kind of lingering ghost, the Underworld will still investigate the reason of their detainment in the human world, but if it was reasonable, they would be dealt with leniently.The compass buzzed twice in the air, an Underworld's gate with glowing silver light opened in front of the ghost. It was the size of a normal bedroom door, and there was a small silver path behind it This path of light was the path of purification transformed by the exorcist\u2019s energy.If the female ghost passed through this path of purification, she can wash away most of her resentment.\u201cGo now.\u201d Chen Yu pushed the female ghost\u2019s shoulder, telling her to enter the gate.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go in, I don\u2019t want to be reborn, please, I beg you, I still have things to do, the person I\u2019m waiting for hasn\u2019t come yet, I\u2026\u201dWithout waiting for the ghost to finish her sentence, she was already pushed inside by Chen Yu. The gate disappeared with a swish, and the compass fell back to Chen Yu\u2019s hand after turning a circle in the air.\u201cWho hasn\u2019t had any regrets in their lifetime ah?\u201d Chen Yu said softly to the empty bamboo forest.When Chen Yu was eight years old, she followed the old man to catch ghosts. At that time, when she was still young and naive, she would always be touched by those ghosts\u2019 tragic fate, thus, when she became unhappy every time she caught a ghost, the old man would say such a sentence to her.\u201cGirl, you have to remember, there would always be regrets in a person\u2019s life, but if you\u2019re dead, then you\u2019re dead, if everyone else go to reincarnate, why won't you do it too?\u201d The old man patted Chen Yu\u2019s head and said, \u201cYou have to know that regrets are created by yourself. If you don\u2019t work hard when you\u2019re still alive, then what\u2019s the use of regretting it after you die?\u201dLooking at the gradually dissipating Yin energy, the bamboo forest was illuminated by moonlight once again. Chen Yu took her phone and opened the chat box with March Floating Rain.I\u2019m Small Account: \u2018Done.\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018This quick? (shocked.jpg)\u2019I\u2019m Small Account: \u2018When will you give the rest?\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018I\u2019ll send someone to look tomorrow, if there\u2019s no problem then I\u2019ll immediately send the remittance to brother.\u2019I\u2019m Small Account: \u2018Okay.\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Did brother get hurt?\u2019I\u2019m Small Account: \u2018No, remember to send me the money, I\u2019ll be offline now.\u2019Chen Yu didn\u2019t wait for the other party to reply. After exiting her penguin account, she felt the remaining ghost energy that was still lingering in the air. Thinking that March Floating Rain said that he would send people to check tomorrow, so in accordance with her principle of perfection, she took out a purification charm from her bag, lit it with a bit of spiritual power and threw it into the air.The purifying charm made speckles of fluorescent light, just like the summer\u2019s fireflies, the light dispelled the remaining ghost energy inside the bamboo forest.Chen Yu picked up her phone and found that it was already one o\u2019clock. She put her phone away and retraced her way back. After she jumped over the park\u2019s gate, she stood on the roadside for a few minutes but found no taxi anywhere.Chen Yu pondered for a bit and planned to just run for a while until she arrive at the city center and catch a taxi there.Then, on the road in the early morning, there\u2019s an extra figure of a young girl running in a ponytail while carrying an old-fashioned linen bag.Chen Yu was concentrating on running when suddenly a shuddering evil energy came from behind. She turned around with vigilance, her eyes were fixed on the black car coming nearer from quite a distance away. That terrifying evil energy came from that car.Tian Fei was one of Third young master Lou\u2019s seven assistants. Today, Third young master went to the scientific research department to attend a meeting until half an hour ago. Now he drove the car to take Third young master back home, but just as the car passed through the corner of Riverside Ave, his keen instinct made him aware of someone\u2019s prying.Tian Fei\u2019s eyes quickly looked out the car, and the moment he saw the girl standing by the roadside, Tian Fei gave a soft grunt.\u201cWhat?\u201d Lou Ming opened his eyes on the back seat.Tian Fei originally wanted to say that there\u2019s nothing wrong, but he remembered what He Qi had mentioned to him before, that Third young master seemed to have an inexplicable affection for the little girl from the Chen family who had just been retrieved back. For this point, several of them assistants also specifically checked Chen Yu\u2019s information, that\u2019s why Tian Fei could recognize Chen Yu with just a glance.\u201cI just saw Mayor Chen\u2019s daughter.\u201d Tian Fei replied.\u201cThe girl from the Chen family?\u201d Lou Ming can\u2019t help but frowned.\u201cYes, she's alone by the roadside.\u201d Tian Fei added.\u201cIt\u2019s so late already, why is she alone outside?\u201d Lou Ming raised his hand to look at the watch, frowning, \u201cTell the car behind to pick her up.\u201d\u201cThird young master, you safety is our first priority.\u201d Tian Fei said.\u201cMe?\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help laughing to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s good if I don\u2019t harm others, who still dare to threaten me?\u201d\u201cThird young master, please don\u2019t speak like this.\u201d Tian Fei couldn\u2019t bear to hear the resignation in Third young master\u2019s words.\u201cAlright.\u201d Lou Ming closed his eyes, obvious that he didn\u2019t want to say much, \u201cLet the car behind pick the girl up.\u201dHence, Chen Yu who had ran halfway became baffled as she was lifted to a car for a free ride.Half an hour later, the bodyguard of Third young master Lou sent the person right to the outside of Chen family\u2019s compound. He faced Chen Yu whose face was full of gratitude with an expressionless face, \u201cThird young master said, if later he finds you running around again, he\u2019ll let us personally send you to Mayor Chen.\u201d\u201c...\u201d The \u2018thank you\u2019 was stuck in Chen Yu\u2019s throat, she couldn\u2019t vomit it out for quite a long time.Author\u2019s NOTE:Chen Yu: Saying I was running around. I haven\u2019t gone to my dad and complain how you carry guns illegally.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: My Grandpa Is An Exorcist MasterAfter tossing about for one night, Chen Yu got up late the next morning and missed breakfast.Chen Yu felt very guilty because she had never slept until this late, she smiled foolishly at Mother Chen in the living room.\u201cShishi, you woke up.\u201d Mother Chen smiled and waved at her daughter while telling Aunt Liu to bring out the warmed up breakfast.\u201cI\u2026 I woke up late.\u201d Chen Yu rubbed against Mother Chen\u2019s side and laughed awkwardly.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not too late, it\u2019s still not ten o\u2019clock yet.\u201d Mother Chen didn\u2019t think that her daughter was being lazy ah, sleeping late was good, if she woke up late, then that proved that her daughter already felt comfortable in this house ah.Chen Yu was even more embarrassed when she heard this, mother ah, are you sure this isn\u2019t a high-level fraudulence?\u201cShishi, go to the dining room and eat your breakfast first, I\u2019ll take you out later.\u201d Since Mother Chen changed Chen Yu\u2019s nickname from Xishi to Shishi yesterday, the father and son of the Chen family also followed suit.\u201cWhere\u2026\u201d Chen Yu just wanted to ask where they would go, but she found out after she turned around that there were two teenagers aside from Mother Chen and Chen Yang in the living room. One of the teenagers with red hair was staring curiously at her.Chen Yang walked over and introduced in a timely manner, \u201cThis is Qin Yi, and this is Shao Hui, they\u2019re all students of Imperial University, one year older than you.\u201dAfter Chen Yang finished speaking, he turned to the two youngsters behind him and introduced his sister, \u201cThis is my sister, Chen Yu.\u201d\u201cHello.\u201d The young man named Qin Yi was relativelt cold, he only nodded slightly to Chen Yu.But Shao Hui, who had red hair, was much more dynamic, he smiled and said enthusiastically, \u201cHello ah, sister Yu, I heard that we went to kindergarten together when we were kids.\u201d\u201cRe\u2026 really?\u201d Chen Yu was embarrassed by the other calling him \u2018sister Yu\u2019, you have to know that in Damu Village, brother and sister were lover\u2019s form of address. Chen Yu felt a bit uncomfortable when she heard this, so she said, \u201cThat, hello, I\u2019m Chen Yu, you can also call me Xishi.\u201dAs soon as Chen Yu\u2019s words fell, Chen Yang secretly whispered \u2018oh god\u2026\u2019, face-palming himself and looked at the others with shame.Qin Yi\u2019s face also showed a brief astonishment, and after Shao Hui froze for a while, he suddenly laughed and said, \u201cGood name, good name.\u201dChen Yu also giggled and the atmosphere around the three people became familiar instantly.If Chen Yu wasn\u2019t kidnapped fifteen years ago, she would grow up with Qin Yi and Shao Hui, speaking of familiarity, she might be more familiar with them than Chen Yang. After all, Chen Yang was four years older than them, so they generally won\u2019t play together that much with Chen Yang.But now, Chen Yu knew nothing about this circle. Chen Yang wanted her sister to integrate little by little, he\u2019s afraid that she would be bullied so he selected very carefully before finding these two people that he considered as 'not bad'. At the same time, he also wished that they can help assist his sister in school.Inside the car heading to suburban district\u2019s horse racecourse.\u201cSister Xishi, have you ride a horse before?\u201d Shao Hui asked as he smiled.\u201cJust call me Xishi, don\u2019t add sister.\u201d Chen Yu corrected\u201cWhy?\u201d Shao Hui was uncertain,\u201d We\u2019re one year older than you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not because of the age difference.\u201d Chen Yu furrowed her brows and explained, \u201cAt the place where I lived before, women and men can\u2019t normally call brother or sister, it can cause misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cMisunderstanding, what kind of misunderstanding?\u201d Shao Hui asked in curiosity.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 lovers kind of misunderstanding.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cReally?\u201d Shao Hui became even more interested, \u201cWhat to do? How about I become your boyfriend then?\u201d\u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d Chen Yu shook her head with all her might.When Chen Yang saw that Shao Hui was taking advantage of his sister, he was about to go to the back and teach this kid a lesson, but then he saw Chen Yu refused so he immediately closed his mouth and stopped it from talking.Qin Yi who sat quietly on the side also looked over curiously over Chen Yu\u2019s big reaction.\u201cWhy?\u201d Shao Hui was astonished.\u201cI don\u2019t like you like that.\u201d Chen Yu also very sincerely comforted him, \u201cBut, don\u2019t be sad, you\u2019re actually really handsome, it\u2019s just that you\u2019re not my type.\u201d\u201cCough\u2026\u201d Qin Yi and Chen Yang didn\u2019t expect to hear such an answer, they saw Shao Hui looked like he suffered from constipation and very dishonestly sneered at him.\u201cI\u2026 thank you.\u201d Shao Hui said with a green face.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, I\u2019m just telling the truth.\u201d the sincerity on Chen Yu\u2019s face made Shao Hui felt terribly uncomfortable.Qin Yi on the side tried his best to control his shaking shoulder and turned his concentration on the cars outside.Shao Hui was so angry when he turned around and found Qin Yi actually laughing behind his back. With evil intention, he planned to pull him under the water, so he pointed to Qin Yi and asked, \u201cThen what kind do you like? How about Qin Yi?\u201d\u201cShao Hui?!\u201d Qin Yi turned his head and glared at Shao Hui.\u201cAlso don\u2019t like.\u201d Chen Yu gave the answer in just a mere second, but she also gave comfort without discrimination, \u201cQin Yi, don\u2019t be sad, you\u2019re actually really handsome, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s also not your type?\u201d Shao Hui automaticalyl finished Chen Yu\u2019s words.Chen Yu nodded in big movements.Qin Yi, who was a little embarrassed and uncomfortable, after being comforted by Chen Yu\u2019s \u2018following a set pattern\u2019 words of consolation, suddenly wanted to laugh again.\u201cThen, your standard is too high ah.\u201d Shao Hui asked, \u201cWe both already represent the top face of Imperial University, but you don\u2019t even look at us ah, then what kind do you plan to find?\u201dAs soon as Shao Hui\u2019s words fell, the three men in the car raised their ears at the same time.\u201cI haven\u2019t meet him yet, so I still don\u2019t know.\u201d Chen Yu seriously pondered over it for a while and came to this conclusion.\u201cThen when you\u2019ve met him, remember to introduce him to us. I really want to see who\u2019s better than me and Qin Yi.\u201d Although Shao Hui said it like this, but the three men inside the car all knew that this girl was still a child and hadn\u2019t began to widen her eyes yet.However, after a really long time had passed, when Chen Yu finally brought her boyfriend to be introduced to them, they had no choice but to admit that there was truly someone who\u2019s better than them in everything.When they arrived at the Xijiao Racecourse, Chen Yang took Chen Yu to change clothes. Inside the female locker room\u2019s entrance, she met Chu Xiao, the daughter of the Deputy Mayor of the capital, Chu Kaiwen.\u201cBrother Chen Yang.\u201d Chu Xiao was wearing a neat riding suit and looked at Chen Yang with a surprised expression.\u201cXiao Xiao?\u201d Chen Yang was astonished to see her, \u201cYou\u2019re also coming here to ride horse?\u201d\u201cEn, what a coincidence ah.\u201d Chu Xiao turned to look at Chen Yu who was beside Chen Yang and said, \u201cSo this is Sister Chen Yu.\u201dAlthough Chen family didn\u2019t publicize the fact that Chen Yu had been found, but the circle of this capital city was so large, so the news had already been spread around.\u201cYes.\u201d Chen Yang introduced, \u201cShishi, this is Chu Xiao.\u201d\u201cSister Chen Yu, I\u2019m Chu Xiao, we have met before when we\u2019re still young.\u201d Chu Xiao warmly held Chen Yu\u2019s hands.\u201cHello.\u201d\u201cAre you here to change your riding clothes? I\u2019ll take you inside.\u201d Chu Xiao said as she also said to Chen Yang, \u201cBrother Chen Yang, I can take Sister Chen Yu from here, you go and change clothes, we can meet at the racetrack later.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you on the racetrack later.\u201d Chen Yang thought that standing in front of women locker room was really inconvenient, so he agreed with Chu Xiao\u2019s suggestion.Chu Xiao took Chen Yu to the dressing room, helped Chen Yu picked a suit and let her went in to change clothes. However, just when Chen Yu finished changing her clothes, a girl with big eyes stood outside her door, looking at her curiously, while Chu Xiao had gone to who knows where.\u201cAre you Mayor Chen\u2019s daughter that was kidnapped as a kid and had just been found back?\u201d The girl with big eyes abruptly asked beside Chen Yu.\u201c...\u201d Chen Yu frowned, not uttering a sound.\u201cWhy are you not saying anything ah? I\u2019m asking you.\u201d the other party asked, somewhat not happy.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cI\u2019m Zhang Wenwen, my father is the Chief of Public Security Bureau.\u201d Zhang Wenwen introduced herself and continued to ask, \u201cI heard you were kidnapped to a particularly remote village in Qingmu province. Why are you so dark ah? Did you work in the sun everyday? I watched some rural pictures on TV, a lot of children at the age of 4 or 5 already had to work on the fields, did you also go to work when you\u2019re 4 or 5 years old?\u201dChen Yu didn\u2019t like Zhang Wenwen\u2019s way of speaking, she frowned and didn\u2019t want to care about her, so she turned and walked to the other side, planning to wait for Chu Xiao to come back.\u201cEh, I\u2019m talking to you, why are you ignoring me?\u201d Zhang Wenwen asked with a bit of anger.\u201cCan\u2019t you see it?\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s patience was finally spent.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to have anything to do with you.\u201d\u201cYou...\u201d Zhang Wenwen had never lost her face like this and her small face immediately turned red from anger.At this time, Chu Xiao came in from outside and saw Chen Yu and Zhang Wenwen, she smiled and said, \u201cSister Chen Yu, Wenwen, you all have changed,\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu nodded, but Zhang Wenwen grunted with a displeased face.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Chu Xiao looked at Zhang Wenwen strangely.\u201cXiao Xiao, she...\u201d Zhang Wenwen pointed to Chen Yu, after a pause, she pulled Chu Xiao to the corner and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t like her, I don\u2019t want to play together with her.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Chu Xiao asked her with a surprise.\u201cAnyway, I just don\u2019t like her.\u201d Zhang Wenwen said angrily.\u201cDid you forget? Today Brother Chen Yang especially invited Qin Yi and Shao Hui out to introduce his sister to them. If you don\u2019t go out with Chen Yu, you can\u2019t see Shao Hui then.\u201d Chu Xiao reminded her.\u201cThat... alright then.\u201d Zhang Wenwen hesitated for a moment and reluctantly agreed.Chu Xiao took Zhang Wenwen\u2019s hand and walked to Chen Yu, saying with a smile, \u201cSister Chen Yu, let\u2019s go together to the racecourse.\u201dChen Yu nodded. They walked out of the locker room with the two behind her and went to the racecourse outside.Chen Yang, Qin Yi and Shao Hui each had already lead a horse along and was now standing on the meadow. When they saw the three people coming over, Chen Yang waved his hand towards his sister, but the smiles on Qin Yi and Shao Hui frozed involuntarily when they saw the two people beside her.\u201cHow come Chu Xiao and Zhang Wenwen here?\u201d Shao Hui couldn\u2019t help asking.\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell them?\u201d Qin Yi asked Shao Hui.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Shao Hui froze for a moment, and then as if guessing something, he cursed, \u201cIt must be that dead girl, Lele, I\u2019ll clean her up when I go back later.\u201dLele was Shao Hui\u2019s sister, and she usually has a good relationship with Zhang Wenwen.When Zhang Wenwen saw Shao Hui, she excitedly ran over and shouted, \u201cShao Hui, you\u2019re here too, what a coincidence!\u201dChu Xiao was a little reserved, so she smiled softly at Qin Yi, \u201cQin Yi, I didn\u2019t expect that I can meet you here.\u201dShao Hui\u2019s face showed that he was impatient while Qin Yi nodded perfunctorily as a response.On the other side, Chen Yang went to his sister and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to take a gentle pony, and then find a coach to teach you first.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need, I can ride horse.\u201d Chen Yu smiled as she shook her head.\u201cYou can ride horse?\u201d Chen Yang was surprised this time.And thus, when Chen Yu rode the horse around the racetrack ten times over, Chen Yang finally had to admit that not only his sister was able to ride horses, but her skill was also really good.\u201cWOW~~\u201d When Chen Yu came back riding again, Shao Hui couldn\u2019t help but praised, \u201cSo valiant! Xishi, when did you learn to ride?\u201d\u201cWhen I was ten.\u201d Chen Yu answered.\u201cWho taught you?\u201d Chen Yang also curiously asked.\u201cNo one taught me.\u201d Chen Yu answered, \u201cThere\u2019s a small group of wild horses near the village where I lived in. I was a friend with a small wild horse there, so when I was little, it always carried me to play, and I naturally learned how to ride.\u201d\u201cCool!\u201d Shao Hui couldn\u2019t help raising his thumb up, and Qin Yi on the side also couldn\u2019t help but somewhat surprised.\u201cWhat are you so proud of?\u201d Zhang Wenwen just couldn\u2019t see how Shao Hui complimenting other people, and she whispered to Chu Xiao on her side, \u201cIn the countryside, isn\u2019t it just cattles, sheeps, pigs and horses, these kind of animals? I\u2019m afraid that others don\u2019t know where she grew up.\u201dChu Xiao pulled on Zhang Wenwen\u2019s sleeve to let her lower her voice down.Right until they left the racecourse, Shao Hui kept talking to Chen Yu, which made Zhang Wenwen had a bellyful of anger. She didn\u2019t expect that Shao Hui would like someone like Chen Yu, after all, in her perception, Chen Yu was so ugly, so it was impossible for Shao Hui to look at Chen Yu. She just didn\u2019t like that her sweetheart being so affectionate with other girls.\u201cChen Yu.\u201d Zhang Wenwen suddenly asked when several people were waiting for the car to come, \u201cI heard that the grandfather who adopted you was a Paranormal fraud, right?\u201dAs soon as Zhang Wenwen\u2019s voice fell, the rest of the people couldn\u2019t help but frowned, only Chen Yu replied calmly, \u201cMy grandpa is an exorcist master.\u201d\u201cExorcist Master? Then his work is catching ghosts, can you do it too?\u201d Zhang Wenwen asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Chen Yu stretched her finger to Zhang Wenwen\u2019s shoulder and smiled unusually mildly, \u201cIf you let me, I can help you exorcise the ghost on your shoulder.\u201dAuthor\u2019s NOTE:Chen Yu: You want to quarrel with me? I\u2019ll scare you to death,\u00a0hehe\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: Stealing Spiritual AuraIt has been more than ten minutes since the car drove from the Xijiao Racecourse. Shao Hui was still in the back laughing uncontrollably, he pointed to Chen Yu and said, \u201cXishi, I never expected you to be this kind of Xishi.\u201dAs long as Shao Hui thought of Zhang Wenwen\u2019s horrified expression just now, he couldn\u2019t stop being happy.\u201cWhy was Zhang Wenwen so scared after she listened to a few of your words?\u201d Qin Yi was more sensible than Shao Hui, he always felt that Chen Yu\u2019s tone of speech was too calm and certain, not like it was edited at all.\u201cWhy else? It must be that Zhang Wenwen\u2019s guts being too small.\u201d Shao Hui said, \u201cLuckily it\u2019s daytime, if it\u2019s at night, I\u2019d have goosebumps hearing that.\u201dShao Hui learned Chen Yu\u2019s appearance just now and repeated what she said to Zhang Wenwen, \u201cHave you been to a lake half a month ago? There\u2019s a drowned little boy there, he must be around seven or eight years old, he has been calling on you\u00a0sister, sister, please help me\u2026, and he\u2019s now laying on your shoulder.\u201d\u201cClose your mouth.\u201d Qin Yi snapped the finger that Shao Hui pointed at him.\u201cDid you panic?\u201d Shao Hui asked, \u201cWhen you\u2019re pointed at by me, did you feel like you had something on your body?\u201dQin Yi\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t speak out a word, but his face wasn\u2019t pretty to look at.Chen Yu just amusingly watched from the side.Compared with the joyous atmosphere behind, Chen Yang\u2019s mood was more subdued, because he realized that Zhang Wenwen\u2019s attitude towards Shishi today would most probably be the attitude of the majority of people in the circle towards Shishi, although they may not be as obvious as Zhang Wenwen\u2019s, but their hearts probably wouldn\u2019t even give Shishi a glance.\u00a0[looking down on her]Although she\u2019s his biological sister and the Mayor\u2019s daughter, however, she had been kidnapped and lost since childhood, and her 15 years of unspeakable growth experience will be a stain on the eyes of these people. As long as Chen Yang thought that someone would despise and talk ill of his sister in places that he couldn\u2019t see, his mood became irritable.\u201cXishi, I have something to ask you. You can just not answer my question if you want, but don\u2019t get angry ah, I\u2019m just really curious.\u201d Shao Hui looked at Chen Yu with a pair of curious eyes.\u201cYou can ask.\u201d Chen Yu smiled in amusement looking at him.\u201cIs your grandpa really an exorcist master?\u201d\u201cShao Hui!\u201d As soon as Shao Hui\u2019s words fell, Qin Yi couldn\u2019t help but yell.\u201cI\u2019m only really curious ah.\u201d Shao Hui said with a wronged expression.Chen Yang glanced at his sister from the rear view mirror. He didn\u2019t blame Shao Hui for speaking about this, and also didn\u2019t speak up to help answer. Because he knew that Shao Hui\u2019s question wasn\u2019t malicious, he was just curious about his sister\u2019s attitude about this matter.\u201cThat\u2019s right ah, my grandpa is an exorcist master.\u201d Chen Yu nodded calmly and answered.\u201cSo there are really ghosts in this world?\u201d Shao Hui whispered as he asked.\u201cThere are if you believe, there isn\u2019t if you don\u2019t believe.\u201d Chen Yu answered.In fact, most people in the world can\u2019t see ghosts, only those who are entangled with ghosts can perceive their existences, but those who are entangled with ghosts all have enmity and sin in their hearts, and so they naturally have ghosts inside their hearts too. Therefore, there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying this sentence at all.[Panda: she's basically saying, the ghost exist (in your heart) if you believe them, and not exist (in your heart) if you don't believe them, if that makes sense...]Upon hearing this, Shao Hui automatically determined that there were no ghosts in the world. He continued to ask curiously, \u201cI often meet some fortune-tellers on the street, when they\u2019re doing their job, they always say something paradoxical and cliche that can be applied to everyone\u2019s circumstances, that\u2019s why it can make people doubtful. Your grandpa is an exorcist master, are there also such rhetorical sentences, like the one you just said to Zhang Wenwen?\u201d\u201cActually, I really just saw a child on Zhang Wenwen\u2019s shoulder, about seven to eight years old, his body was wet all over as if he had been just taken out of the water. He grabbed Zhang Wenwen\u2019s shoulder tightly like this\u2026\u201d Chen Yu said as she leaned her body, wanting to grab Shao Hui\u2019s shoulder.\u201cHiii~~\u201d Shao Hui took a breath in fright, shouting while hiding himself behind, \u201cJust don\u2019t say if you don\u2019t want to say, why scare me ah?!\u201d\u201cYou deserve it.\u201d Qin Yi happily sent out the three words.\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Chen Yu giggled while covering her mouth, she didn\u2019t continue to scare Shao Hui.Chen Yang looked at his sister\u2019s reaction, and the frown on his forehead gradually relaxed. Even if she\u2019s too shy to speak her mind, but she also won\u2019t be ashamed into anger. Shishi was confident and calm about her past, neither haughty nor humble.After the car returned to the army compound, the three of them made a promise to meet again after Imperial Capital University started its new semester, and then they each went to their own home.Arriving at home, after she accompanied dad and mom to eat dinner, Chen Yu excused herself and went upstairs on the pretext that she\u2019s too tired today. Thus, in the living room, there were only Chen parents and Chen Yang left.\u201cDid something happen today?\u201d Although Shishi kept saying that she had a good time today at dinner, but Chen Yang kept a straight face all along. Mayor Chen knew that something else had happened in the afternoon.Chen Yang didn\u2019t conceal anything and told about Zhang Wenwen\u2019s matter to his parents.After listening to the story, Mayor Chen\u2019s brows were furrowed while Mother Chen was even more angry, \u201cHow do Zhang family teach their daughter? She\u2019s too much! I\u2019ll go to Director Zhang\u2019s wife tomorrow and have a good chat.\u201d\u201cEven if you talk with the Zhang family, can you talk it out to everyone in the Imperial Capital\u2019s circle?\u201d Mayor Chen disagreed.\u201cThen tell me, what should we do?\u201d Mother Chen was angry, \u201cIt was so difficult to find my daughter back, is she for them to bully as they please? What were you doing, Chen Yang? Watching your sister getting bullied?\u201d\u201c...\u201d Chen Yang looked at his mother like he had received an incomparably wrongful treatment, \u201cShishi was so powerful, I was just entirely useless.\u201dChen Yang then continued to retell about how Chen Yu frightened Zhang Wenwen, and the content of her and Shao Hui\u2019s conversation in the car to the Chen parents.\u201cI don\u2019t think sister has inferiority because of her experience, she really likes Damu Village, and also really respects Wu Lao.\u201d Wu Lao was the grandfather who raised Chen Yu, \u201cMaybe all these years, she had been living a happier life than what we thought.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Mayor Chen agreed, \u201cFurthermore, despite Shishi living under such harsh environment, she still can pass Imperial University's test by relying on herself. How many people from Qingmu Province that can pass Imperial University's exam ah? You can just go outside and ask how many children inside the circle that can have such a high score? Those who despise our Shishi, we don\u2019t need to bother about them, we can just not interact with them in the future.\u201d\u201cThen, it\u2019s just like this?\u201d Mother Chen was still somewhat angry.\u201cDidn\u2019t Chen Yang say that our daughter didn\u2019t suffer any losses? After all\u2026\u201d Mayor Chen looked at his son, \u201cIf ever your sister get any disadvantage, can you just stand and not care about it?\u201d\u201cOf course I can\u2019t.\u201d Chen Yang immediately assured.After Mother Chen listened to her son\u2019s assurance, her mood became slightly better, however, she still secretly remembered the Zhang family. The next time Mrs. Zhang came to cotton up to her, Mother Chen resolutely won\u2019t respond to her.However, on the other side, Chen Yu who went upstairs on the pretext to rest, was actually sitting on the bed cross-legged while chatting with March Floating Rain after receiving a notice from the bank.I\u2019m Small Account: \u2018I\u2019ve received the money.\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Brother, master ah, that century-old female ghost was broken directly by you? The people I sent to check said to me that there wasn\u2019t even a trace of the ghost spirit there, it was as clean as if there has never been any ghost in the first place.\u2019I\u2019m Small Account: \u2018I didn\u2019t break her, I opened the Underworld Gate and sent her away.\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Oh sh-, oh shi-! Omg, I\u2019m so excited!\u2019I\u2019m Small Account: \u2018\u2026\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018You can actually open the Underworld Gate????\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Brother, master ah!! If this is your small account, then what is the big account?\u2019Seeing this sentence, Chen Yu remembered that she hadn\u2019t changed the name of this penguin account, so she clicked on the settings and changed her name.I Want To Fix Road: \u2018Not small account.\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018\u2026\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Brother, your taste is really unique.\u2019I Want To Fix Road: \u2018The money has been received, if there\u2019s nothing else then I\u2019ll go offline.\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Wait wait wait wait\u2026\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Brother, let\u2019s add friends ah, I\u2019ll find you in the future if I have things that need your help, okay?\u2019Chen Yu took a glimpse at the 500 thousand yuan notification on her phone just now, then replied with risen eyebrows.I Want To Fix Road: \u2018That have to depend on the payment.\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Brother, don\u2019t worry, the one million given to you this time isn\u2019t the price for opening the Underworld Gate. The next time, if I ask you to do something that needs you to open the Underworld Gate, the price will definitely be higher than this.\u2019Higher than a million???\u00a0Chen Yu sat up straight with excitement.I Want To Fix Road: \u2018Then you can find me later if you have something, and I\u2019ll pick it up when I have the time.\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Then, should we first add friends?\u2019Chen Yu approved March Floating Rain\u2019s friend application, logged out, and then rolled on the bed with her phone, \u201cLots of money, lots of money,\u00a0hahahahaha~~!\u201dAfter Chen Yu rolled for a while, she climbed back up again. She took out the bank card from her wallet and placed it in front of her, and assuredly said, \u201cOld man, don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m holding Damu Village\u2019s road! From now on, this card will be a special fund for Damu Village\u2019s road construction!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Chen Yu wondered, \u201cHow much does it cost to build a road?\u201dChen Yu surfed on the internet with her phone but found nothing. After thinking about it, she decided to find an opportunity and ask her family\u2019s father,\u00a0anyway, isn\u2019t he a Mayor? Surely he also handle road construction?\u201cBuzz.\u201dSuddenly, the linen bag on the bedside table shook, letting Chen Yu recovered her senses before reaching out for the compass inside.\u201cYou\u2019re also so useless ah.\u201d Chen Yu looked at it for a while and found out that the spiritual energy inside the compass wasn\u2019t enough, she couldn\u2019t help but asked, \u201cI only used you once to open the Underworld Gate and you have emptied your energy? Weren\u2019t you more durable when Old man used you before?\u201d\u201cBuzz buzz\u2026\u201dThe compass shook twice, the pointer rolled rapidly and pointed to the north.\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking about\u2026?\u201d Chen Yu knew what it wanted to do by looking at the direction of the pointer and refused decisively, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t go there, can\u2019t you just slowly absorb energy from the air?\u201d\u201cBuzz buzz, buzz buzz.\u201d\u201cI know, I know, but I can\u2019t do anything ah.\u201dIn fact, Chen Yu was also worried, she must rely on the compass to open the Underworld Gate with her current strength, and the compass will consume a large amount of energy to assist her in opening the gate. Wu Lao\u2019s own strength was high, and he only used the compass to calculate the position of the Underworld Gate, so it won\u2019t consume the compass\u2019s aura too much. This was why Wu Lao can use the compass many times over and the compass would still be full of energy. However, Chen Yu only opened the Gate once, and the compass almost depleted all of its energy.However, if there\u2019s no assistance from the compass, Chen Yu was really not sure if she can open the Underworld Gate by relying on her own strength. Furthermore, even if she didn\u2019t want to open the Gate, the compass itself has a protective function, if she came across a particularly ferocious evil spirit, if there\u2019s no energy left in the compass, then it would be really dangerous for her.Chen Yu gazed at the north, she knew in her heart that the house with such abundance of spiritual energy was really hard to come by. This time, she had expended a total of six elementary expelling talismans, consumed the energy in the compass, and even consumed more than half of her own spiritual energy.It was still okay with her own consumed energy, as long as she properly practice austerities, she would recover within a week. Those exorcise talismans were also alright, when her energy had recovered, she can draw them all in just a day. The problem was only the compass, if she had to wait for it to replenish its energy, she estimated that it would take around two or three months to be full. If she can only make one million in two or three months, then the speed of making money will be greatly reduced.Chen Yu bit her finger and looked back and forth between the compass and the bank card. Eventually, for money, no, it should be the desire to repair Damu Village\u2019s road had prevailed. And thus, she once again jumped down from the second floor window, following the dim light and the familiar road, she finally arrived at the outside of Lou family\u2019s small compound.Chen Yu felt the aura around her, chose a particular place that was rich in energy, dug a hole, and put the compass inside.\u201cBuzz buzz\u2026\u201dThe compass seemed extremely dissatisfied with this position because the energy inside the wall was denser, why should it be placed outside?\u201cBe well-behaved, okay?\u201d Chen Yu tapped the compass and whispered, \u201cI tell you, this courtyard is owned by someone else, we can\u2019t just casually go inside. It\u2019s already immoral to steal energy under other people\u2019s roof ah, you have to be content. I\u2019ll bury you here first, I estimate that you can finish absorbing the energy after three days, I\u2019ll dig you out at that time.\u201d\u201cBuzz buzz\u2026\u201dThe compass still seemed dissatisfied.\u201cIf you keep on talking nonsense, I won\u2019t even let you stay here.\u201d Chen Yu saw that the compass finally became obedient, so she pushed some soil to fill the hole and leveled it, then stepping on it to make it firmer. She also moved a stone from the side and pressed it on top before sneaking back home.Chen Yu had just walked away for less than two minutes, and the closed gate of the Lou family\u2019s compound was opened. A robust man in camouflage clothes came out and walked to the position where Chen Yu had just buried the compass in. He dug out the compass and brought it into the yard.Author\u2019s NOTE:Lou Ming: This girl, so troublesome!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Third Young Master\u2019s Evil SpiritsIn the study room on the second floor, Lou Ming took the compass passed by his assistant and looked carefully at it, his brows frowning slightly.\u201cThird young master, I think we need to re-investigate this Chen Yu.\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s third assistant, Cheng Peng, said seriously.Lou Ming didn\u2019t speak, still looking at the compass in his hand. The pure black compass wasn\u2019t big, it was more or less the size of a palm, lying quietly on his hand, it looked nothing special.\u201cThird young master?\u201d Cheng Peng asked Lou Ming again when he found that he didn\u2019t reply.Lou Ming put the compass in his hand on the table, looked up and asked Cheng Peng, \u201cI remember, the old man who raised the girl was a half-immortal, right?\u201dWhen Chen Yu first appeared in the small courtyard, He Qi, one of the assistants reported to Lou Ming about Chen Yu\u2019s life experience, however, He Qi told him that the old man was a Paranormal Fraud, not a half immortal.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 she having this compass is also reasonable, right?\u201d Lou Ming continued to ask.\u201cYes, but\u2026\u201d Cheng Peng said his suspicion, \u201cThe compass is a metaphysical thing after all, Chen Yu had only been back for three days, but she had been coming over here with the compass two times already. Tonight, she secretly buried the compass under the courtyard wall, she must have a purpose for doing this.\"\u201cWhat purpose?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cI don\u2019t understand about metaphysical thing, but there\u2019s a formation arranged by Master Mao in the courtyard, which may be related to this.\u201d Cheng Peng doubted.\u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2026 that this Chen family\u2019s little girl wants to destroy the formation?\u201d Lou Min looked with a little surprise.Cheng Peng nodded.\u201cWhat would happen if the formation is broken?\u201d Lou Ming began to make hypothesis about this, but he can\u2019t visualize anything.Thinking of the result, Lou Ming\u2019s expression started to become desolate, but there was also a trace of relief mixed inside.\u201cThird young master!\u201d Cheng Peng felt a little distressed when he noticed the change in Lou Ming\u2019s mood. He wanted to comfort him but couldn\u2019t find any word to say, in the end, he can only make a promise, \u201cWith us here, we will never let anyone destroy the formation in this yard.\u201dLou Ming realized that he lost himself for a bit, he quickly adjusted his mind and smiled slightly towards Cheng Peng, \u201cNo need to be so nervous, if the formation is broken, Master Mao will naturally come and repair it again, actually, this isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d\u201cHow could it not be a big deal? Now that Master Mao is abroad, he won\u2019t be able to come here in just an hour and a half, and the evil spirits inside Young master\u2019s body is really unstable.\u201d Cheng Peng was agitated, \u201cIf you suddenly lose control\u2026\u201dWhen Cheng Peng mentioned \u2018out of control\u2019, his hands clenched into fists, and the muscles on his face trembled.\u201cLose control ah\u2026\u201d Lou Ming was unconcerned, \u201cThen I\u2019d have to trouble you.\u201dCheng Peng who was originally still able to control himself, when he heard Lou Ming\u2019s words, he suddenly turned around and walked away, \u201cI\u2019m going to bring Chen Yu here now.\u201d\u201cStop.\u201d Lou Ming immediately shouted to Cheng Peng.\u201cThird young master.\u201d Cheng Peng turned around, a look of stubbornness painted his face. He knew that he was agitated, but when he thought of the consequences if Third young master lose control, Cheng Peng suddenly felt that he couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201cYou guys\u2026\u201d Lou Ming was very clear that everyone in this yard was more concerned about his safetythan himself, \u201cJust go check if you want to, but don\u2019t do anything unnecessary without any evidence.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Cheng Peng still felt that he had to control every unstable factors in advance, even if it was just a suspicion.\u201cCheng Peng, are my words already useless now?\u201d Lou Ming looked at Cheng Peng and said with a cold voice.After spending three years with Third young master, Cheng Peng knew more than anyone else that it was not easy for Third young master. Because of his relationship with the evil spirits, Third young master almost had no friends, he can\u2019t go to crowded places, and he even had to avoid his family. Simply put, the more he cared about someone, the more he had to stay away from them.After receiving the task to protect Third young master, the first thing Cheng Peng did was to scan through every points that needed his attention. The last point that needed his attention was, in the event of Lou Ming getting out of control, he had to immediately eliminate him.When he first saw this command, as a soldier who was accustomed to obeying whatever command given to him, his emotion didn\u2019t stir too much. Cheng Peng was a special soldier who has killed many people, for the sake of national security, no matter whether it\u2019s a man, woman, old or young, as long as it\u2019s for the country, he would not hesitate to do anything.What surprised him was that, when Lou Ming saw him for the first time, he very straightforwardly asked, \u201cHave you read through the list?\u201dCheng Peng nodded without any expression.\u201cThen I have to trouble you if I get out of control.\u201d Lou Ming said with a touch of apology in his tone, as if to repeat again how he was really sorry to trouble him with this matter.Cheng Peng was slightly surprised. However, although he appreciated it, he didn\u2019t have many unnecessary emotions.It wasn\u2019t until six months later before he knew that the last point was added by Lou Ming himself. It turned out, when Lou Ming was eighteen years old, the evil spirit was out of control once. Qi Hao, the personal assistant at that time was unwilling to hurt Lou Ming, but he was also afraid that those evil spirits would harm ordinary people if he went out, and thus, he handcuffed himself and Lou Ming together, locked inside the room. Although Master Mao quickly came over to calm Lou Ming down, but at that time, Qi Hao who had locked himself with Lou Ming to prevent him from leaving, was already dying after having been beaten by the crazed Lou Ming.When he was sent to the hospital, Qi Hao\u2019s body quickly recovered due to his strong physic, but his spirit had completely collapsed due to the strong erosion from the evil spirit. When Qi Hao woke up, he became a violent and irrational killing machine, he had to be kept in a mental hospital forever.Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit has existed with him since his birth, and it also got stronger along with his growth, reaching the peak when he was fifteen years old. Anyone without firm willpower or weak body can\u2019t get near him at all, otherwise, the weak willed people can be affected by the evil spirit, becoming irritable, and even becoming mentally disturbed after a long time exposure, while the weak bodied ones will become seriously ill due to the erosion.Before the age of fifteen, Lou Ming never dared to stay in a place for more than two hours, and after the age of fifteen, he was trapped in this small courtyard that was surrounded by the array arranged by Master Mao to suppress the growth of those evil spirits, and then used a special method to weaken them. And thus, he has lived, jailed in this place for three years to control those evil spirits, until that one time they suddenly broke out.Lou Ming went to the hospital to see Qi Hao when he woke up, and when he returned back, he personally added this point to the list of commands. It was only half an hour, and a determined special soldier was turned into a mental patient by him, Lou Ming didn\u2019t dare to think how much casualties would he caused if he went out of the vicinity in his frenzied state. He felt like a humanoid weapon, he didn\u2019t want to hurt others, but he also knew that the country wouldn\u2019t give him up easily.Lou Ming was the most sophisticated weapon expert in the country, because of the weapons that he designed, China\u2019s status in the world couldn\u2019t be shaken, as they can reduce many casualties on the battlefield. To some extent, Lou Ming was the patron saint of China.Even if more people like Qi Hao were sacrificed, the country will still keep Lou Ming. Lou Ming knew this very well, but he obviously disagreed.After he came back, he talked for a long time with his father, Minister Lou, \u00a0but Minister Lou never agreed. Finally, Lou Ming simply said: If there is ever such a thing again, if you don\u2019t kill me, then I\u2019ll kill myself.\u201cCheng Peng?\u201d Lou Ming was a little unhappy to see Cheng Peng\u2019s delay in replying to him.\u201cI must protect your safety.\u201d Cheng Peng returned to his senses. He gritted his teeth, even if it made Third young master hate him, he won\u2019t let anything threaten Third young master.Lou Ming looked at Cheng Peng coldly, while Cheng Peng also looked back at Lou Ming with a face full of guilt and uneasiness, but he still insisted.\u201cSo be it.\u201d Lou Ming sighed, took the phone beside him, clicked on WeChat, found Master Mao\u2019s number, and started a video call.The video was quickly connected, an elderly man appeared at the end of the video.\u201cLou Ming ah, is there something you need to find me?\u201d Master Mao asked kindly.\u201cMaster Mao, I\u2019m not bothering you, am I?\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s time for rest right now, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Master Mao knew that Lou Ming wouldn\u2019t call him for no reason.Lou Ming picked up the compass on the table and showed it to Master Mao. He asked, \u201cMaster Mao, please look at this.\u201dMaster Mao narrowed his eyes and looked at it for a moment, then said, \u201cThis is a compass, it looks a bit old, where did it come from?\u201dLou Ming looked at Cheng Peng and saw that he was listening with his ears upright, so he continued, \u201cSomeone buried it outside the courtyard wall.\u201d\u201cOutside the courtyard wall?\u201d Master Mao frowned immediately.\u201cWhy? Does this compass has any effect on the formation?\u201d Lou Ming asked.Cheng Peng became even more nervous, as long as Master Mao said that there was even a trace of influence, he would immediately rush to the Chen family and arrest her.\u201cThat couldn\u2019t be, I can immediately feel if there\u2019s a problem with the formation.\u201d after Master Mao said this, he asked, \u201cWho buried this? Where was it buried in?\u201d\u201cA little girl, buried in the southeast corner.\u201d Lou Ming thought something and added, \u201cThis girl\u2019s grandfather is a half-immortal.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s like this.\u201d Master Mao thought for a bit then said, \u201cThis girl must be here to steal some spiritual aura.\u201d\u201cStealing aura?\u201d Lou Ming raised his eyebrows in surprise.\u201cThe yard you lives in is the most powerful place in the Imperial Capital, and aura is the thing most needed by Heavenly Teachers.\u201d Master Mao explained, \u201cYou said that that girl\u2019s grandfather is a half-immortal, I estimate that she found the aura rich in your courtyard, so she wanted her Spiritual Treasure to absorb some of it. But she must also have noticed the formation in the yard, so she just stole some aura leaked out from the formation inside.\u201d\u201cThat is to say\u2026 it doesn\u2019t have any effect on me?\u201d Lou Ming grabbed the point.\u201cAs long as she doesn\u2019t enter the courtyard, however she toss around outside won\u2019t affect the formation.\u201d Master Mao chuckled, \u201cBesides, how could the formation I arranged be so easy to be broken by a little girl?\u201dAt that time, someone seemed to be calling Master Mao. When Lou Ming saw it, he thought that he already got what he needed, so he said, \u201cMaster Mao, you\u2019re busy, I won\u2019t bother you again.\u201dLou Ming hung up the video, looked up and said to Cheng Peng, \u201cYou heard it, can you rest assured now?\u201d\u201cEven if this is the case, I won\u2019t let her come again. I insist to informing Mayor Chen to look after his daughter.\u201d Cheng Peng said.\u201cCheng Peng.\u201d Lou Ming put down the phone and said with sincere words, \u201cDo you know? Mayor Chen is a very talented official. But as long as you tell this matter, even if it doesn\u2019t affect me at all, Mayor Chen will soon be transferred from the capital, and my father won\u2019t let him take even a step further.\u201dCheng Peng froze.\u201cA good person can only help a limited number of people around him, and a good official can benefit one party or even the country.\u201d After Lou Ming said this point out, he stopped talking anymore. He knew that Cheng Peng could understand.\u201cI listen to Third young master.\u201d Cheng Peng said after a moment of thinking.Lou Ming smiled faintly, and the heavy atmosphere instantly dissipated. He pushed the compass in his hand and said, \u201cPut the compass back.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re planning\u2026\u201d Cheng Peng looked at him with some disbelief.\u201cMaster Mao already said that it doesn\u2019t have any effect.\u201d Lou Ming said, \u201cBesides, we also took this without asking, it can be considered stealing, it\u2019s bad ah\u2026\u201dCheng Peng hesitated for a while, and finally accepted the compass, letting someone to bury it back again. He only secretly decided that in the future, Chen Yu must not be allowed to get close to Third young master.TL NOTE:Simply put, the more he cared about someone, the more he had to stay away from them.\u00a0- omg, that's... *pats Lou Ming on his back and then quickly hide before he notices me* (\u00b4\u30fb\u03c9\u30fb\uff40) Lou Ming is such a lonely bunny~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: School StartedIn a few days, the Imperial University was about to open. According to Chen Yu\u2019s plan, she had registered at the university earlier at this time, so when she returned back to the Chen family, she didn\u2019t need to be so anxious about it.\u201cShishi ah, are you going to live in campus, or are you going to live at home?\u201d Mother Chen asked at breakfast.Chen Yu naturally wanted to live in school, but when she turned her head and looked at Mother Chen\u2019s expression, her mouth suddenly couldn\u2019t speak.\u201cOf course she would live on campus.\u201d Mayor Chen noticed her daughter\u2019s difficulty and said to help, \u201cUniversity is the right time to make friends, if she lives at home, there will be less time to interact with her classmates.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right ah.\u201d Mother Chen could also understand it, but she felt that she had just found her lost daughter for a few days before she had to leave the house again, of course her heart would feel reluctant.\u201cMom.\u201d Chen Yu comforted, \u201cMy school isn\u2019t far away, I\u2019ll come back here every weekend in the future. If you miss me, you can come to school to find me.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, then you have to return home every weekend ah.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu nodded heavily at Mother Chen, letting her felt happy.Sure enough, a daughter is the intimate little cotton padded jacket, Mayor Chen comfortably ate an extra bun and turned to her son, \u201cYou also will come back every weekend in the future.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come back if there\u2019s no other plan.\u201d Chen Yang was a policeman. After graduating from police school, he directly entered the Criminal Police Brigade. He often lived in the dormitory for work convenience and rarely returned home. This time, he took a long vacation because he had to take Chen Yu back, but he soon had to go back to work again.\u201cEn.\u201d Mayor Chen also understood the nature of his son\u2019s work and didn\u2019t force him.Chen Yu waited until Father Chen had more or less done with his meal before she hesitantly asked what he thought about yesterday\u2019s matter, \u201cDad, can I ask you something?\u201dMayor Chen gave a surprise look at Chen Yu, this was the first time that she took the initiative to ask questions after she returned home, so he immediately became interested. He put down his chopsticks and looked at his daughter, asking gently, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026 do you know how much it costs to build a road on the mountain?\u201d Chen Yu blinked her big eyes and looked at Mayor Chen with expectation.\u201cBuild road?\u201d Mother Chen looked at her daughter with some puzzle, Chen Yang was also curious.\u201cIs it for Damu Village?\u201d Although Mayor Chen didn\u2019t personally go to Damu Village to pick up his daughter, he knew the environment where Chen Yu grew up clearly, so when Chen Yu asked him how much money it would take to build a road, Mayor Chen immediately thought of Damu Village.Chen Yang also guessed right, when he went to the mountain to find Chen Yu, he can only arrive at Damu Village with a motorcycle after a long 10 hours of arduous ride, he knew the road condition clearly.\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu explained, \u201cIt takes too much effort to go to the city from Damu Village. When I was a kid, I went to school at the neighboring town, I had to get up at five every morning and walked for two and a half hours to get there. Later, when I was in junior high and high school, I had to live in school and I could only go back once a month.\u201d\u201cActually, Damu Village is still very close to the urban area, with several mountains in between. The village chief said that as long as Panshan Highway is repaired, people in Damu Village will be able to get in and out easily, and the people in the village can live a better life.\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cAnd, don\u2019t people in the city like to travel now? The scenery of our Damu Village is particularly good, perhaps, we\u2019d be able to develop the tourism there.\u201d\u201cWhen I was admitted to college, I promised the village chief that if I can make money in the future, I will find a way to help the village build a road.\u201d Thinking that she\u2019s able to make money now, Chen Yu said excitedly, \u201cSo I want to ask how much money is needed, that way, I can plan well ah.\u201dChen Yu was still speaking with excitement, she simply didn\u2019t realize that the three people\u2019s faces suddenly became heavy, and after she finished speaking, Mother Chen was already crying.\u201cMom, why are you crying?\u201d Chen Yu was startled.\u201cWhen you were a kid, you had to walk through the mountain for two and a half hours to go to school, isn\u2019t the mountain road dangerous? Did you have any adults with you?\u201d The more Mother Chen said, the more she felt aggrieved, it was as if she saw Chen Yu, at the age of six or seven, such a little child, crossing over mountain after mountain while the sky is still dark by herself to go to school.\u201cMom, mom, don\u2019t cry, am I not okay now?\u201d Chen Yu understood that Mother Chen felt distressed for her, she suddenly felt a twinge of guilt, she herself didn\u2019t feel that it was that hard when she was a child, but when she saw Mother Chen sad like this, she also felt somewhat unwell.Chen Yang handed over the napkin, while Chen Yu pulled out two sheets and helped wipe Mother Chen\u2019s tears.\u201cRight, isn\u2019t the child okay now? Don\u2019t cry.\u201d Mayor Chen was also somewhat sad, but he was more rational than Mother Chen.Mayor Chen knew, when Chen Yu was brought to Qingmu Province, she fell ill before they can find a buyer. The traffickers looked for several village doctors for her, but when they heard that it can\u2019t be cured, they threw Chen Yu in the mountains for fear of getting into more trouble. Chen Yu happened to be picked up by Wu Lao who was going out to do things for others, then he brought her to Damu Village to raise her up.Therefore, with how kind the people in Damu Village were to Chen Yu, she will always remember to repay them, and that\u2019s why she wanted to build them a road. Mayor Chen was both proud and ashamed of his daughter\u2019s approach of repaying back in his heart.\u201cIf you just want to build a road in the village, it won\u2019t take much money, but if you want to build Panshan highway that connects the urban area, then you can\u2019t do it alone.\u201d Mayor Chen looked at his daughter and patiently explained.Chen Yu didn\u2019t know much about this aspect, \u201cBut the village chief said that the road was about to be built ten years ago, but because of the lack of funds, there\u2019s no way to build it anymore.\u201d\u201cThe local government might had a plan ten years ago, but then it was stranded for some reason.\u201d Mayor Chen speculated.\u201cThen, how can I build the road ah?\u201d Chen Yu said anxiously.Mother Chen saw her daughter\u2019s anxiousness and immediately helped her, \u201cJianxun, do you know anyone in Qingmu Province? Help your daughter to ask around.\u201dMayor Chen looked at his wife, frowning in difficulty.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m asking you to do anything, isn\u2019t it just asking? Can\u2019t it be done?\u201d Mother Chen thought that this matter wouldn\u2019t violate any law, it was just asking, so there should be no problem.Mayor Chen saw his daughter\u2019s expectant gaze, then he nodded after some thoughts, \u201cI\u2019ll find someone to inquire.\u201d\u201cThank you, dad!\u201d Chen Yu was immediately very happy.Mayor Chen stood up, rubbed his daughter\u2019s head and said warmly, \u201cI\u2019m going to work.\u201dThe time passed quickly, and in a blink of an eye, it was almost time for school. Mother Chen originally wanted to send her daughter to school in person, but because of some matter, she had to go to another part of the country for a few days, so she just gave her daughter the things that she prepared in advance, and then told Chen Yu in passing that she has to put on sunscreen during military training sessions to prevent her skin from getting darker.Mayor Chen had tons of things that he had to take care of everyday, so he naturally didn\u2019t have time to send his daughter to school, finally, the task of sending Chen Yu fell to Chen Yang. Chen Yang took a leave of absence, but who knew that he would get a call from his captain when the car had just arrived at the Imperial University\u2019s gate, saying that the case he had been investigating had major breakthrough and to immediately go back.Chen Yang looked at Chen Yu apologetically, \u201cSorry, brother can\u2019t accompany you to register, I\u2019ll let Shao Hui and Qin Yi to come over and pick you up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m already this big, I can handle it myself.\u201d Chen Yu smiled, shaking her head.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go first.\u201d The case was urgent, Chen Yang didn\u2019t dare to stay any longer, so he drove away after saying some more words.Chen Yu waited until the car drove away, and then dragged her suitcase inside the university. Following some direction signs, asking some people along the road, Chen Yu completed the enrollment and found the girl\u2019s dormitory where she would be staying.When she arrived at the dormitory, there were already two girls inside. One with a lovely round features called Fang Feifei, the other was a tall girl named Zhang Muwan, both of whom were natives of Imperial City.The three exchanged their names, when Fang Feifei knew that Chen Yu was also Imperial City\u2019s people, she asked in surprise, \u201cChen Yu, did you go to the beach for you summer vacation? That\u2019s why you got sunburned like this.\u201d\u201cNo, I was in Qingmu Province during the summer vacation.\u201d Chen Yu didn\u2019t want to mention her own \u2018complicated\u2019 life experience with others, so she casually avoided it.\u201cQingmu Province is located in the subtropical region, the sunshine is strong there, and the people there generally have a somewhat darker skin.\u201d Zhang Muwan quipped, \u201cIf you say that you\u2019re someone from Qingmu Province, I will believe it.\u201d\u201cIt can also be said like this, my grandpa is from there, and I often go to see him.\u201d Chen Yu explained.\u201cSo it\u2019s like this.\u201dWhile the three were talking, the last roommate in their dormitory room arrived. They saw a beautiful fair lady in a floral dress, walking inside with two men carrying her luggage.\u201cI\u2019m here, thank you, seniors.\u201d The beauty smiled and thanked the two boys for their help.\u201cJunior sister Youyou, come find us if you want us to do anything ah.\u201d The two boys left reluctantly under the sweet smile of the beauty.\u201cFinally left.\u201d The beauty took a deep breath and turned to meet two pairs of ridiculing eyes and one pair of curious eyes. Han You thought that they should be her roommate, so she smiled and introduced herself generously, \u201cMy name is Han You, you can call me Youyou, you guys are my roommate, I\u2019m very happy to meet you.\u201dThe four of them introduced themselves again, Fang Feifei was quite lively, grabbing Han You and asked, \u201cYouyou, did the two seniors were interested in you?\u201d\u201cWhat interest? It\u2019s just that they saw me having a difficulty with my luggage, so they offered help ah, don\u2019t you guys have seniors to help you with your luggage? Han You asked.\u201cNo ah.\u201d It was only Chen Yu that shook her head honestly.The three of them turned to look at Chen Yu, facing Chen Yu\u2019s dark skin, silently showing sympathetic eyes.\u201cMight be because my things were less than yours.\u201d Chen Yu thought.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d When interacting with new friends, the three people were very gentle and didn\u2019t reveal the truth.The four girls chatted for a while until it was time for lunch, they decided to go together, and then strolled around the campus. As soon as the four people walked out of the dormitory door, Chen Yu heard someone shouting her name.\u201cXishi!\u201d\u201cShao Hui, Qin Yi!\u201d Chen Yu turned to see the two handsome guys at the door of her dormitory, she immediately walked over with a surprised face, \u201cWhy are you guys here?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t brother Chen Yang said to wait for us at the gate? How come you weren't there and you didn\u2019t even pick up the phone when we called?\u201d Shao Hui said with gnashed teeth.\u201cAh?\u201d Chen Yu pulled out her phone from her bag, sure enough, she saw several missed calls, she immediately felt guilty, \u201cI turned my phone on silent mode earlier so I didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d\u201cForget it, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re fine.\u201d Shao Hui saw that Chen Yu kept on peeking to the three girls behind him and Qin Yi, he smiled and waved his hand, \u201cHello, you guys are Xishi\u2019s roommate right? Do you want to go to lunch together?\u201dChen Yu turned her head and saw the three girls nodding without restraint.\u2026Inside the Lou family\u2019s small courtyard, Lou Ming was making a video call with Master Mao.\u201cIsn\u2019t tomorrow the opening ceremony of Imperial Capital University?\u201d Master Mao asked.\u201cEn.\u201d Lou Ming nodded.\u201cI can\u2019t go this time, but I\u2019ve prepared a few things in advance, at the time, you can just sit down on the podium.\u201d Master Mao said.Lou Ming frowned, raised his hand and looked at the jade buckle worn on his left wrist with a red string, he said worriedly, \u201cHow about we just pass it this time? If something goes wrong and you\u2019re not there, you won\u2019t have any way to control it.\u201d\u201cLou Ming, the opening ceremony of the Imperial Capital University is when Wenquxing entered the world, the auspicious aura will envelop the entire university compound, it was the only opportunity when you can release your evil energy, you must not let it slip by.\u201d Master Mao said rightfully.[T/N: Wenquxing is the legendary deity of imperial examinations and literary affairs]Lou Ming was silent, of course he knew that this was his only chance, but Master Mao couldn\u2019t go to the Imperial University with him this year, if something unexpected happened and no one can deal with it, the consequences will be disastrous.\u201cLou Ming, I will send my disciple over, as long as the auspicious aura gathered, then you take off the jade buckle, there won\u2019t be any accident.\u201d Master Mao consoled him.\u201cAlright.\u201d Lou Ming finally nodded.TL NOTE:I felt ashamed that I was such a lazy panda that didn't like going to school although the school was so easy to be reached... \ua20d .\u032e \ua20dOoff~ I hope those three new girls will be good friends. *crossingmyfingers* (\u3063\u00b4\u03c9\uff40c)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: I\u2019ve Already Caught You\u201cFeifei, hurry up, we\u2019re already late!\u201dFollowing the shout of Zhang Muwan, Fang Feifei hurriedly ran out of the dormitory, and the four girls who had just met for a day walked to the university\u2019s sports ground in laughter.Today is the opening ceremony of Imperial University, the four of them arrived at the sports ground late because of Fang Feifei. The four could only stood behind the crowd silently and looked at the podium from afar, but they couldn\u2019t see clearly in this distance after all.At ten o\u2019clock, the broadcast music immediately stopped, and the opening ceremony immediately began. The host introduced the leaders of the school on the stage, while the four on the back clapped continuously, in any case, they can\u2019t see clearly, so they just decided to follow everyone.\u201cNow, I invite a freshman representative of this year to speak on behalf of the new students.\u201d After another round of applause, Chen Yu saw a boy standing in front of the microphone from afar.\u201cI heard that Qin Yi was the freshman representative last year, I don\u2019t know if ours is also as handsome or not.\u201d Fang Feifei asked, looking at the blurred figure in the distance while whispering.\u201cThat couldn\u2019t be ah.\u201d Han You replied, \u201cThere are very few people as handsome as Qin Yi.\u201d\u201cI really envy Xishi, unexpectedly, she lives in the same big compound as the most handsome boy.\u201d Yesterday, the three heard Shao Hui called her \u2018Xishi, xishi\u2019, so they all changed her form of address after they returned.Chen Yu grinned under the three\u2019s envious eyes, and when she was about to say something, she suddenly felt the atmosphere around changed.Chen Yu\u2019s eyes lit up, and her eyes fell on the podium again. She saw a pale golden light falling from the sky on the head of the freshman representative who was speaking, followed by a dozen of similar lights falling on the crowd standing on the sports ground. Chen Yu raised her head and looked in the direction of the golden lights, and found a faintly discernible star.Is that\u2026Wenquxing?[fun fact: Wenquxing has the character of \u2018star\u2019 in it]The golden light fell one by one, Chen Yu heard a light hum like it was coming from the earth itself as a huge aura suddenly arose from the ground merged with those golden lights, forming a huge pale of golden light ball, rapidly expanding around the sports ground, and the entire campus was enshrouded within it in a matter of seconds.How comfortable\u2026Chen Yu didn\u2019t have time to sigh before a blood red fiendish evil spirit rose from the ground, colliding with the auspicious aura in the sky.Blocking the auspicious aura?Chen Yu frowned tightly, looking at the direction of the podium, feeling a little puzzled.\u00a0It\u2019s such powerful evil spirits, how could I not found it before?The blood red evil spirits fell from the chairperson on the stage, the first to be affected was the freshman standing underneath, but the sky above the sports ground was covered by a transparent, sturdy boundary which slowed down the infiltration speed of those evil spirits. When the evil spirits seeped outside the boundary little by little, they were dealt with by the auspicious aura from inside so that they wouldn\u2019t cause any bad impact on the students here.On the high podium, Lou Ming, as a honorary professor of the Imperial University, sat at the very corner position, there was the jade buckle that he had just undid on the table in front of him. Just now, he felt the dense auspicious aura, and under the prompt of Master Mao\u2019s disciple, he unfastened the jade buckle on his wrist, allowing the long-sealed evil spirits to be released without scruple. While his body was extremely relaxed, but his heart was strained like a taut string\u201cPlease rest assured, Third young master, the formation has been activated, and the evil spirit won\u2019t affect the students and teachers inside this university.\u201d Master Mao\u2019s disciple, Lin Gui, said.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d When Lou Ming heard this, his complexion slightly relaxed and his anxious heart gradually eased down, \u201cMr. Lin, please continue to observe. If there\u2019s any problem, remind me in time, and I will immediately wear the jade buckle and leave here.\u201dThe students standing under the stage were the future of the motherland, and they can\u2019t be lost because of him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Third young master, everything is normal at the present.\u201d Lin Gui continued to look over the audience after saying this sentence, paying close attention to the direction of those evil spirits.\u201cI\u2019ve troubled you.\u201dLou Ming sat on the stage, listening to the speech of the freshman representative, feeling the relaxation that he hadn\u2019t felt for such a long time as those evil spirits were released from his body.An hour later, the opening ceremony officially ended, and the principal of Imperial Capital University came to Lou Ming and said with a smile, \u201cProfessor Lou, I look forward to your lecture this year.\u201d\u201cI will do my best to prepare.\u201d As the honorary professor of Imperial Capital University, and also as a compensation, after the opening ceremony every year, and when the evil spirits in his body was at their weakest, he will offer a lecture as repayment.\u201cAlright.\u201d Lou Ming came across the principal at the research conference of the Chinese Academy of Science, the principal found that although he was young, he had a very extensive, deep knowledge, and brilliant study on physics, chemistry, mathematics etc, and accordingly so, the principal solicited him to come to Imperial Capital University to teach. It was a pity that Lou Ming seemed to be in poor health. Finally, at the principal's repeated invitation, Lou Ming reluctantly agreed to come to Imperial University and open one lecture every year.However, one lecture is enough, one should know that each of Lou Ming\u2019s lecture would bring some new ideas and research directions, far exceeding the current world\u2019s level.The principal still had a lot of work to do, and considering Lou Ming\u2019s physical condition, the principal left after a few words of greeting. At this time, Lin Gui had already packed up the things that was used to arrange the formation and went back to Lou Ming again, \u201cThird young master, this time, the auspicious aura had blocked the evil spirit very smoothly.\"\u201cI have troubled Mr. Lin.\u201d Lou Ming nodded to show his appreciation.\u201cThird young master is too polite.\u201d Lin Gui looked at the faint auspicious aura that was still lingering in the air and said, \u201cThird young master, if there\u2019s nothing urgent, it\u2019s better to walk around the campus for a while.\u201dLou Ming looked at Lin Gui with astonishment.\u201cThis year\u2019s students\u2019 destinies seemed to be more in line with Wenquxing than the previous ones, the auspicious aura on the campus is also much stronger than in previous years. You always stay alone in the small courtyard on weekdays, and today you have a rare opportunity to walk on campus. Don\u2019t worry, there won\u2019t be any problem for two or three hours.\u201d Lin Gui said.\u201cThank you, Mr. Lin.\u201dLin Gui half raised his body towards Lou Ming in a polite gesture, and brought his assistant with him to leave the Imperial University.He Qi, who was standing beside him, naturally heard what Lin Gui said, so he walked to Third young master and reminded in a low voice, \u201cThird young master, please walk around.\u201dLou Ming froze for a moment, then gently rose from his seat. With a touch of novelty, he walked into the crowd for the first time.\u201cSo handsome ah, is he a teacher in our school?\u201d\u201cWhere will there be such a young and handsome teacher at Imperial University?\u201d\u201cThen, a senior? If he\u2019s a senior, I don\u2019t know if he has a girlfriend or not.\u201dAre the female students now so bold?\u00a0Lou Ming shook his head, he can\u2019t help laughing in spite of himself, but this feeling was indeed, very novel and very pleasant. Lou Ming continued to walk along the school\u2019s main road to the place where most of the students gathered.Chen Yu, who was following far behind Lou Ming, discovered that this man, with a whole body filled with evil spirits, it\u2019s okay if he didn\u2019t leave the school ground, but to even going to a crowded place, she suddenly couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. She walked over a few steps, caught up with Lou Ming and grabbed the other\u2019s arm.His arm was suddenly grabbed by someone, Lou Ming turned around in surprise, and met a pair of black and bright eyes.\u201cYou follow me.\u201d Chen Yu, regardless of whether the other party agreed or not, dragged Lou Ming and ran into the grove beside the road.He Qi chased with two bodyguards and found that Chen Yu was pulling Third young master to have a chat by the lake outside the grove. She didn\u2019t seem to do anything that would be harmful to Third young master, so they hid themselves within the trees.\u201cThis isn't good.\u201d Chen Yu dragged the man to the empty lake before releasing him, and then looked at Lou Ming with her serious small face.\u201cWhat?\u201d Lou Ming looked at Chen Yu with a questioning look.\u201cDon\u2019t feign ignorance ah.\u201d Chen Yu stared at Lou Ming and asked, \u201cWasn\u2019t it you that just sat on the podium?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lou Ming nodded.\u201cAren\u2019t you the person that just used the auspicious aura to block the evil spirit just now?\u201d Chen Yu asked again.Lou Ming\u2019s calm expression instantly froze.\u201cHah, I guessed right, your have a guilty conscience.\u201d Chen Yu pointed to Lou Ming proudly, \u201c I\u2019m an exorcist, I\u2019m very sensitive to evil spirits ah.\u201dSo this girl is an exorcist.\u201cSo?\u201d Lou Ming blinked, looking at the little girl\u2019s proud look, he suddenly felt somewhat amused.\u201cWhat?\u201d Chen Yu froze.\u201cI\u2019m discovered by you, what are you going to do to me?\u201d Lou Ming asked with interest.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chen Yu hesitated and said, \u201cI think that you sitting on the podium means that you know the leaders of the school. Moreover, when the evil spirits were roused, the sports ground was already set up with a boundary that could block them so they didn\u2019t cause any bad effect, so I thought that you don\u2019t have any thoughts about harming people.\u201dLou Ming raised his eyebrow, he didn\u2019t expect the little girl to speak out all the arrangements of Master Mao and Lin Gui in just a few simple words,\u00a0seems like this girl has some skills.\u201cTherefore, I won\u2019t argue about the things before, but how can you go around in campus ah?\u201d Chen Yu said seriously, \u201cYou have evil spirits in your body, although most of them had been washed away by the auspicious aura just now, the evil spirits in your body will still affect the weaker people around you. And although there are still some auspicious aura around the school, it may disappear any time now. Do you know that it\u2019s easy to affect others when you walk around like this?\u201d\u201cSo you pulled me over, do you want me to leave from here?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Chen Yu raised her head, a pair of big, clear eyes blinked and blinked.Lou Ming suddenly thought of Chen Yu when she was a child, this expression of hers now seemed to be the same as before. She tilted her head and blinked her eyes while calling him big brother, but the girl at that time was a lot fairer than now.\u201cThen, what if I don\u2019t want to leave?\u201d Lou Ming suddenly wanted to tease the little girl.\u201cNot leaving?\u201d Chen Yu frowned.Lou Ming returned her a \u2018what will you do?\u2019 smile.This person actually attacked her with a smile, it was simply too provoking! Chen Yu immediately became angry, she extended her finger and pointed it to Lou Ming, saying with an overbearing manner, \u201cIf you don\u2019t go, be careful that I\u2019ll catch you!\u201dWhen Chen Yu said \u2018I\u2019ll catch you\u2019 these three words, her palm unfolded in front of his face, then she pulled it to make a fist, making a gesture as if she was catching him.\u201cPfft~!\u201d Chen Yu thought that she was intimidating to Lou Ming, but in actuality, her endearingly silly, adorable movements amused him to no end.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re still laughing!\u201d Chen Yu became more angry, \u201cI tell you, I have caught a one thousand year old zombie, your itty bitty evil spirits are simply too easy, if it\u2019s not because of my master\u2019s rule to not undertake a task if there\u2019s no money, believe it or not, I\u2019d have already caught you by now!\u201d\u201cAre you so powerful?\u201d Lou Ming also knew that he was being somewhat impolite because he couldn\u2019t hold back and laughed just now, so he quickly adjusted his facial expression.\u201cIt seems that you won\u2019t believe me if I don\u2019t show my skill.\u201d Thinking of his teacher\u2019s rule that she shouldn\u2019t show her skill without getting money, Chen Yu suddenly asked fiercely, \u201cDo you bring money?\u201dLou Ming froze for a moment, then shook his head. He didn\u2019t go out on weekdays, where would he bring money with him?\u201cThen, do you have anything valuable?\u201d Chen Yu asked again.Lou Ming fumbled around his pockets and finally pulled out a pen. This pen was a birthday gift from Lou Ming\u2019s elder sister, it was said that the tip of the pen was made of pure gold, which was very precious.\u201cIt\u2019s just a pen, forget it, you\u2019re too cheap ah.\u201d Chen Yu grabbed the pen in his hand under Lou Ming\u2019s amazed gaze and put it inside her own pocket before reaching over Lou Ming\u2019s palm. Under Lou Ming\u2019s puzzled gaze, she gathered spiritual energy and drew a calming spirit charm on Lou Ming\u2019s palm.When the last stroke was drawn, Lou Ming clearly felt that all of the evil spirits around his body suddenly disappeared.\u201cNow, do you know how powerful I am?\u201d When Chen Yu saw his shocked expression, she proudly said, \u201c This is just a simple charm which can keep those evil spirits in control within two hours. That\u2019s why, your evil spirits can\u2019t hurt me at all, while I\u2019m in a good mood now, you better leave here quickly, or else, I\u2019ll really show you my skill ah.\u201dAt this time, Chen Yu\u2019s phone rang, she picked it up and saw that Fang Feifei was calling her to eat. She put away her phone and glared at Lou Ming, \u201cI\u2019m going to eat, you hurry and go.\u201dAfter speaking, Chen Yu hurried and ran out. After she\u2019s already at quite a distance, she suddenly turned her head back and looked at Lou Ming, and once again did that gesture of \u2018catching\u2019 him.\u201cHa-\u2026\u201d Lou Ming closed his mouth with his palm and laughed the second time.\u201cThird young master?\u201d He Qi saw that Chen Yu had walked away, so he came over, feeling uncertain.\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d Lou Ming turned and walked outside the school, although he was really curious how this little girl was going to \u2018catch\u2019 him.TL NOTE:Chen Yu, be careful that you're gonna be the one who got 'caught' instead (*\u2267\u2200\u2266*)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Calming Spirit TalismanWhen Chen Yu finally arrived at the school cafeteria, Fang Feifei and the others had already got their meals and was sitting at the dining table, beckoning Chen Yu to come over.\u201cWhy did you go to the toilet for so long?\u201d At the end of the opening ceremony, Chen Yu used the excuse of going to the toilet to follow behind Lou Ming secretly.\u201cAh? I didn\u2019t bring a tissue, so I went back to the dormitory again.\u201d Chen Yu smiled a little awkwardly.\u201cCan you not mention toilet\u2019s matter in a cafeteria?\u201d Han You interrupted the two as she can\u2019t endure it anymore.\u201cThat\u2019s it, let\u2019s eat, let\u2019s eat.\u201d Fang Feifei handed Chen Yu the cleaned chopsticks and suddenly found that the other person\u2019s face was a little not right, so she asked worriedly, \u201cXishi, you\u2019re looking somewhat off, are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere?\u201dZhang Muwan and Han You both also listened and saw Chen Yu looking dispirited, her lips were even somewhat pale.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, maybe I ran too fast just now, I\u2019ll just take a rest for a bit and it\u2019s all good again.\u201d Chen Yu explained.\u201cWhy did you run so fast at such a hot day? Be careful of heatstroke ah.\u201d Zhang Muwan said.\u201cNo way ah.\u201d Chen Yu clipped a piece of pork ribs and nibbled on it, \u201cLet\u2019s eat, don\u2019t we have to go buy things after this?\u201d\u201cRight, tomorrow is military training ah, I have to go buy another sunscreen.\u201d After talking about their planned afternoon shopping, the three no longer paid any attention to Chen Yu\u2019s complexion and began to discuss with great interest what to buy later.Chen Yu sighed secretly, sure enough, it took too much of her spiritual energy to draw the charm just now, it seemed that it would take two days for her to fully recover.Lou Ming returned to the Lou\u2019s small courtyard and sat alone in the study room. He didn\u2019t know if it was the effect brought by the charm drawn by the little girl or if it was a psychological effect, but Lou Ming always felt a slight coolness roaming on the palm of his right hand.Lou Ming spread his palm, there was nothing but lines. However, the absence of evil energy on his body proved to him plainly that the little girl did draw a charm on his palm just now. As if it was a mere child\u2019s play, the charm drawn with her fingers was more effective than the jade buckle from Master Mao.Charm?\u00a0Lou Ming suddenly remembered that a week ago, the little girl seemed to have given him a safety charm. That time, he just casually put it between some random book.\u00a0What book did I read that day?\u00a0Lou Ming turned around and rummaged his bookshelf, his memory was really good, so he quickly found the book he was looking for, a World Geographic magazine.Lou Ming opened it in passing, and when he turned to the page with the paper crane inside, his brows couldn\u2019t help but slightly frowned. He didn\u2019t know when, but the yellow paper crane had turned gray.Ting-a-ling\u2026The sudden ringing on his phone interrupted Lou Ming\u2019s contemplation. He took the phone and found that it was a video call from Master Mao, so Lou Ming closed the magazine and opened the video call.\u201cMaster Mao.\u201d Lou Ming greeted the old man over the phone with a smile.\u201cYou look good.\u201d Master Mao looked at Lou Ming\u2019s complexion for a while and found that his pale face was a lot rosier, he thought that the warding process had went smoothly.\u201cToday is thanks to Mr. Lin Gui, Master Mao, how long will it be before your return? Lou Ming asked.\u201cI\u2019ll go back in about half a month.\u201d Master Mao said, \u201cWhen you open a lecture in Imperial University, I\u2019ll come and accompany you personally.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve troubled you.\u201d In fact, the best time to open the lecture would be in the one week after he warded off the evil spirit, because it was when they were at their minimum. But Lou Ming had to stay in the same confined space with hundreds of students and teachers for two hours. Even if Lou Ming wore the jade buckle to limit the evil spirits from leaking out, but he was still worried that there would be physical discomfort, or even worse, people with weak willpower would be affected by those evil spirits. Therefore, Lou Ming would usually trouble Master Mao or Master Mao\u2019s disciple, Lin Gui, every time he had to go out like that.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I also want to check your condition in the time of my absence.\u201d Master Mao said.Suddenly, a cool feeling burst around his palm, Lou Ming looked down subconsciously but still saw nothing.\u201cMaster Mao.\u201d Lou Ming pondered for a moment before asking, \u201cCan you draw a calming spirit talisman?\u201d\u201cCalming spirit talisman?\u201d Master Mao nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s a basic talisman, I naturally can draw it.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Lou Ming wondered, \u201cThen why have I never seen you use it on me?\u201d\u201cYour situation is special, we can\u2019t use calming spirit talisman.\u201d Master Mao replied.\u201cIsn\u2019t calming spirit talisman\u2019s use is to restrain the evil spirits in my body?\u201d Lou Ming felt strange, \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be used?\u201d\u201cYes, calming spirit talisman is used to dispel the evil spirits, but the evil spirits in your body are too strong, the common talisman will be of no use.\u201d Master Mao explained.No use?\u00a0Lou Ming subconsciously looked at his right hand again, he thought for a bit and decided not to tell about Chen Yu first. He turned around and asked, \u201cOrdinary talisman is useless, so there must be something that can restrain the evil spirits in my body right?\u201d\u201cYes, but it can\u2019t be found at the present.\u201d Master Mao said with some pity in his tone.Lou Ming asked in surprise, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cInheritance of metaphysics has actually fallen somewhat, many schools have lost their heritage and have disappeared in the wave of history. Luoshan exorcist school was one among them, but the only calming spirit talisman strong enough to control the evil spirits in your body is only Luoshan\u2019s talisman.\u201d\u201cA lost art?\u201d Lou Ming intuitively determined that Chen Yu must be an exorcist from Luoshan school.\u201cYes, but even if I can find Luoshan\u2019s talisman, I still won\u2019t use it on you.\u201d Master Mao immediately followed.\u201cWhy is it?\u201d Lou Ming didn\u2019t understand, \u201cSince it can calm down the spirits on my body, why not use it then?\u201d\u201cThe Luoshan school is a relatively unique existence in the metaphysical world, their skills are special, and the talismans they drew are extremely potent and have strong lethality to ghosts.\u201d Master Mao explained, \u201cTheir charms are not only for suppressing evil, but they will also harm the carrier of which those spirits resided in. The ghosts that carry evil spirits generally also did all kinds of evil, the purpose of using a calming spirit talisman is to disperse their souls, so there\u2019s no problem with it, but you can\u2019t use it.\u201dLou Ming\u2019s right hand suddenly clenched while Chen Yu\u2019s big, black eyes flashed in front of him, \u201cBe careful that I catch you!\u201d\u201cLou Ming, why did you suddenly ask about this? Did you encounter something?\u201d Master Mao was a bit worried.\u201cNothing.\u201d Lou Ming shook his head, \u201cI just watched a zombie movie yesterday, there\u2019s a Taoist there who subdued a one thousand year old zombie with a calming spirit talisman, it looked really impressive, so I couldn\u2019t help but wanted to ask about it.\u201d[T/N: the zombie here is different from the western ones, it's like\u00a0this one.]\u201cI didn\u2019t think that you can also believe in something like a movie.\u201d Master Mao couldn\u2019t help laughing.Lou Ming returned an awkward smile without speaking anything else.\u201cI still have a meeting later so I have to leave now, contact me again if you need me.\u201d\u201cSee you again.\u201dThe two ended the call, Lou Ming put down his phone and his eyes fell on his clenched right hand with a blank expression, feeling the coldness flowing around it. He didn\u2019t know if this coldness was what Master Mao said as something that would cause harm to his body, Lou Ming suddenly let out a bitter smile.\u201cAren\u2019t you just a bad person inside her eyes? Using a calming spirit talisman to deal with you is right.\u201d Lou Ming shook his head helplessly with his hand on his forehead, \u201cIt seems that this little girl didn\u2019t brag, she indeed can catch me.\u201dBut this charm that can completely restrain the evil spirits inside was truly too attractive to him, after a moment of pondering, Lou Ming called He Qi in.\u201cThird young master.\u201d He Qi stood by the table, waiting for further instruction.\u201cSend someone to Qingmu Prvince, find Chen family\u2019s daughter\u2019s grandfather and see if you can bring him to Imperial Capital.\u201d Lou Min ordered.\u201cYes.\u201d Although He Qi felt odd, but he didn\u2019t ask anything in the end.\u201cOh, right, don\u2019t let anyone else know about this matter.\u201d Lou Ming warned.\u201cYes.\u201dIt was absolutely necessary because Lou Ming didn\u2019t want to pull the little girl in. After all, she\u2019s only 18 years old and had just been retrieved by her family, if she got involved in his business, there\u2019s no way she could be free in the future. Moreover, if this was known by his father, he would surely go to find Mayor Chen.\u2026At twelve midnight, Chen Yu sat in a grove where it was the most abundant with spiritual spirit on the south-east corner of Imperial University, meditating silently to restore her energy. When she drew the spiritual charm for the man with a body full of evil spirits in the day, Chen Yu had consumed a lot of energy, so she had to meditate to recover.In fact, Chen Yu felt that she had a big loss during the day today, a sheet of intermediate exorcism talisman can be sold as much as 200 thousand yuan online, while catching a hundred year old ghost worth one million. Today, she spent a much greater power to draw the charm than catching the hundred year old ghost, but she only received a pen from the other party,\u00a0how much a pen worth? Can it be sold for a hundred yuan?But, even if at that time Chen Yu brought a calming spirit talisman, she still would choose to draw it using her own spiritual energy. After all, a calming spirit talisman is too strong, while it can suppress the evil spirits, but the murderous energy inside the talisman will also damage the carrier\u2019s body. The other party is a living person, not a ghost or a zombie, Chen Yu won\u2019t do anything that can harm others.However, the man seemed to be rich ah, when she meet with him again, she will ask him to make up the price. Chen Yu thought about it while absorbing the aura, and finally when the sky was about to lit up, Chen Yu ended her one night meditation.With a sigh, Chen Yu slowly opened her eyes. She felt the pure spiritual power in her body and can\u2019t help but admire, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that Wenquxing would come to Imperial University today, this auspicious aura is really different ah.\u201dDing!Suddenly hearing her phone ringing, Chen Yu took it from her side to find that it was the \u2018customer\u2019 March Floating Rain who\u2019s looking for her.March Floating Rain: \u2018Brother, are you there? Are you there?\u2019I Want To Fix Road: \u2018Here.\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Great! Brother, there\u2019s an urgent matter that needs your help ah, the payment is excellent.\u2019Urgent matter?\u00a0Chen Yu thought that she had to go to the army base for military training, she estimated that she can\u2019t go back for a month, so she planned to refuse.I Want To Fix Road: \u2018I have something that I can\u2019t leave for a month, I believe that I don\u2019t have the time.\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018One month? One month is fine ah, on month later is also fine ah.\u2019I Want To Fix Road: \u2018Didn\u2019t you say that it\u2019s an urgent matter?\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not that bad these days.\u2019I Want To Fix Road: \u2018\u2026\u2019I Want To Fix Road: \u2018What is it? How much is the payment?\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Five million, I can give you three million in advance.\u2019Although March Floating Rain had only made one dealing with this I Want To Fix Road brother, but he had a thorough understanding of this person\u2019s love for money, so he took the lead to open the price first.Five million, this much? Chen Yu\u2019s heart was shaking.I Want To Fix Road: \u2018Still catching ghost?\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019I Want To Fix Road: \u2018How about the cultivation?\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Still a hundred years like before, but this time it\u2019s a malevolent ghost, can brother deal with it?\u2019Malevolent ghost?\u00a0In fact, the last time she caught the hundred years old female ghost, Chen Yu didn\u2019t spare any effort and opened the Underworld Gate, but since it\u2019s a malevolent ghost this time, she would just simply break it without opening the gate. The most important thing was that, there\u2019s a lot of money involved ah, at present, Chen Yu didn\u2019t know how much money does it take to build a road, so the more money there was, the better it would be.I Want To Fix Road: \u2018Talk to me again after one month.\u2019March Floating Rain: \u2018Brother, can I consider you taking this? Is the remittance can be sent to the same account as the last time? I\u2019ll send you the advance payment first and let my brother go to buy things for preparation.\u2019Chen Yu actually didn\u2019t need to prepare anything, but since the other party was this sensible, Chen Yu just silently typed an \u2018En\u2019.Ding!Sure enough, within one minute, her phone received a three million receipt reminder. Chen Yu seriously suspected that the other person had already opened their internet banking interface, just waiting for her to nod her head before they immediately send the money over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Believe It Or Not, I Already Caught YouCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBecome Fairer LaImperial Capital University\u2019s military training was arranged in a military camp in the western suburb of the Imperial Capital. It concludes on National Day. During this period, no matter whether you were from the city or country, the top student or scum, a man or woman, you still\u00a0have to\u00a0participate and only then can you return to school.But obviously Chen Yu was an exception. After all, the physical strength required to catch ghosts wasn\u2019t what ordinary people had. As for the natural enemy of women, Chen Yu totally didn\u2019t care as the sun of the imperial capital was much gentler than that of\u00a0Qingmu\u00a0Province.But in order to not be estranged, Chen Yu still followed her roommates\u2019 whitening skin care routine and used a face mask every night. During the day, even if she forgets to wear sunscreen, several of her other roommates would apply it for her. So more than half a month later, under the diligent supervision of the three roommates, our dark classmate\u00a0Xishi\u00a0turned fairer!\u201cOh, my God, we spend so much time in the sun every day. And you still turn fairer\u00a0Xishi!\u201d Fang\u00a0Feifei\u00a0stared at Chen Yu incredulously.\u201dI didn\u2019t\u00a0notice\u00a0before.\u201d Han You reached out and touched Chen Yu\u2019s smooth\u00a0and tender\u00a0face.\u00a0\u201cAlthough\u00a0Xishi\u00a0was dark, her skin is smooth and tender.\u201dZhang\u00a0Muwan\u00a0turned over Chen Yu\u2019s skin care products: \u201cThe mask you used doesn\u2019t seem to be a common brand on the market. Where can I buy it?\u201d\u201dMy mother gave me a\u00a0gift\u00a0card at\u00a0a\u00a0beauty center, and they gave me this mask.\u201d Chen Yu explained.\u201cWhich beauty center\u00a0ah? Why is the potency of this mask so good?\u201d Zhang\u00a0Muwan\u00a0concluded that the mystery of Chen Yu\u2019s whitening was due to this mask.\u201cI don\u2019t remember but I\u2019ll show you after military training.\u201d Chen Yu picked up a few masks and handed it out to them. \u201cWould you like to try them first?\u201d\u201cThen we won\u2019t be polite.\u201d It was quite common for girls to share masks between themselves. The three people weren\u2019t shy and were joyous when they took the mask, laying on their beds to sample it.\u201dThere are still a few days before military training is over, ah.\u00a0Now I have a face mask on, and it hurts.\u00a0I must be sunburned.\u201d Because of the mask, Han\u00a0You\u2019s\u00a0voice was a little vague.\u201dSoon, there will only be\u00a0a week left,\u201d Fang\u00a0Feifei\u00a0replied.\u201dGirls, let\u2019s hold on.\u201d Zhang\u00a0Muwan\u00a0laid in bed, raised her right hand and clenched it into a fist to cheer them on.Chen Yu listened to their conversation while chatting on her cellphone with Mother Chen. Mother Chen sent messages\u00a0every day\u00a0to Chen Yu to ask about her situation and to also remind her to apply the face mask.Chen Yu just responded\u00a0to Mother Chen\u2019s message when the\u00a0Penguin\u00a0app that was idle suddenly popped out with a message prompt. Chen Yu opened it doubtfully and found it was March Floating Rain.March Floating Rain: Brother are you here?I Want\u00a0To\u00a0Fix\u00a0Road: ??March Floating Rain: Brother, you are here\u00a0ahahahah, where are you right now????Chen Yu felt the other party\u2019s urgency\u00a0from their exaggerated tone full of energy then\u00a0replied back: I\u2019m in the Imperial Capital.March Floating Rain: Imperial Capital? Imperial Capital!! Have you come back after finishing things???I\u00a0Want\u00a0To\u00a0Fix Road: I\u2019ve been in Imperial Capital and haven\u2019t finished my things yet.March Floating Rain: Brother, no, Deity, can you spare a night and go help this younger brother deal with the malevolent ghost first???I\u00a0Want\u00a0To\u00a0Fix Road: What\u2019s wrong?March Floating Rain: Something unexpected happened. That malevolent ghost must be dealt with before midnight tomorrow\u00a0ah.Tomorrow\u00a0night? It was already very troublesome to sneak out of the barracks. Then to go catch ghosts in the middle of the night then rush back that same night for training the next day. Chen\u00a0Yu thought about it and felt this was too last minute. She was about to refuse it but saw the other side sent another message.March Floating Rain: How about another\u00a0200,000?March Floating Rain: I know it\u2019s not appropriate to change the time, but\u00a0Deity, help this younger brother ah. I boasted\u00a0in front of my grandfather.You\u00a0boasting\u00a0has nothing to do with me but that extra 200,000\u00a0can\u2019t be taken lightly ah. Chen Yu deleted her typed words and replied: I\u2019ll make time to go there tomorrow evening.March Floating Rain: Thank you, thank you Deity. Can Deity get this done before midnight??I\u00a0Want\u00a0To\u00a0Fix Road: Address.March Floating Rain:\u00a0Xiaohan\u00a0Mountain in the northern suburbs.Chen Yu checked the address and found that\u00a0it was quite far from here. If she was lucky enough to get a cab, she could arrive before\u00a0midnight,\u00a0but it was a little difficult to get it done before midnight.But\u2026 an hour and a half away, the other party shouldn\u2019t be aware of it. With a fluke mentality, Chen Yu struck down one word: Maybe.En, maybe, it wasn\u2019t certain, and this wasn\u2019t a complete lie.March Floating Rain: Great Deity, you have saved your little brother\u2019s life ah. If there is anything you need in the future, say it, your little brother will not hesitate to help.I\u00a0Want\u00a0To\u00a0Fix Road:\u00a0Are you trying to suck up to me?March Floating Rain:\u00a0Hehehe\u2026you noticed.I\u00a0Want\u00a0To\u00a0Fix Road: I won\u2019t give a discount on friendship.After\u00a0Chen Yu finished replying, she went offline and ignored him.March\u00a0Floating Rain sent a long series of ellipsis to express his feelings of being speechless.=In\u00a0Imperial Capital at\u00a0an ancient Chinese-style building\u00a0facing the sea,\u00a0a young man in a white T-shirt, March Floating Rain, who had just chatted with Chen Yu, walked out of the room with a joyous expression.\u201dLiang Yu, where\u00a0are you going ah?\u201d A man in a suit who looked 27 or\u00a028 years old shouted to Liang Yu.\u201dJust going out to take a look around.\u201d Liang Yu didn\u2019t intend to pay attention to the man. He casually\u00a0replied back\u00a0that he was going out, passed by the man and\u00a0was planning to leave.\u201dAre you going to find a helper.\u201d The man sneered.\u201dSo what?\u201d Liang Yu stood in the corridor and looked at the man coldly.\u201cBrother, I\u2019m doing this for you too. It\u2019s not very easy to deal with a century-old malevolent ghost. Don\u2019t boast about this and drag others down with you.\u201d The man blamed as if convinced that Liang Yu couldn\u2019t find a Heavenly Master to help deal with this malevolent ghost.\u201dYou don\u2019t have to worry about it, cousin.\u201d Liang Yu replied.\u201dLiang Yu, although I don\u2019t like you very much, I don\u2019t want you to die.\u201d The man frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s just a\u00a0wooden\u00a0peach sword. What\u2019s the use of holding\u00a0onto it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s useless for me to hold it but I won\u2019t give it to you.\u201d Liang Yu saw the man\u2019s face turned green then left the courtyard feeling refreshed.Liang Yu is the legitimate son of the Liang family, but he is the weakest in this generation. After 20 years of hard work, he was barely able to help people through geomancy. In addition to decades of taking care of simple ghosts. He encountered some profound malevolent ghosts who have a high level of cultivation and was chased by them. The man who just stopped him was Liang\u00a0Guang, Liang Yu\u2019s older cousin and this generation\u2019s genius of the Liang family.Originally, it\u00a0was okay to be a little lower in terms of cultivation. After all, some people who have high accomplishments have low cultivation. However,\u00a0Liang Yu had a\u00a0thousand-year-old\u00a0wooden peach sword in his hand. A top-grade\u00a0Taoist\u00a0weapon\u00a0fell into the hands of Liang Yu who was a good-for-nothing. The rest of the Liang family were naturally greedy. Although Liang Yu\u2019s father obtain the wooden peach sword by chance\u00a0and left it to Liang Yu.Half a month ago,\u00a0Old\u00a0Man\u00a0Liang asked Liang\u00a0Guang\u00a0to\u00a0go to\u00a0Xiaohan\u00a0Mountain in the northern suburbs to \u201cclean up\u201d. Liang Yu knew that\u00a0it was\u00a0Old Man\u00a0Liang\u2019s friend, Master Mao, who specially ordered for that place to be \u201ccleared\u201d. It was said that there will be a very important person who will stay in that villa for a few days after a month and it needs to be 100% guarantee\u00a0that there wasn\u2019t a trace of evil energy left.Liang\u00a0Guang\u00a0went to\u00a0Xiaohan\u00a0Mountain but suddenly discovered that there was a century-old malevolent ghost. After fighting the malevolent ghost, Liang\u00a0Guang\u00a0couldn\u2019t defeat it. When he returned, he said to\u00a0Old Man Liang,\u00a0\u201cThat malevolent ghost is so powerful that he needs to borrow Liang Yu\u2019s wooden peach sword.\u201dSaying\u00a0he wanted to borrow it, in fact, it was just an excuse to take it away. It\u2019s estimated that the old man also thought\u00a0that giving it to Liang\u00a0Guang\u00a0would be\u00a0the best way to utilize the wooden peach sword.\u00a0But\u00a0how could\u00a0Liang Yu\u00a0be willing, he\u00a0hated his cousin the most since he was a child.\u00a0So,\u00a0in order to keep the wooden peach sword, Liang Yu was so hot-headed that he said he could also get rid of the malevolent ghost.But\u00a0he didn\u2019t have the\u00a0capability.At this time, he thought of the new Deity on the Internet, \u201cI Want\u00a0To\u00a0Fix Road\u201d who was able to open the Underworld Gate. Then contacted him,1\u00a0and finalized the matter of exorcism after a month. But unfortunately, the important person suddenly changed the appointment, indicating that he would be living there tomorrow night.Liang Yu couldn\u2019t help it. He couldn\u2019t beat the malevolent ghost himself. He could only use the Internet and reach out to \u201cI Want\u00a0To\u00a0Fix Road\u201d.\u00a0Then he thought that if the Deity wasn\u2019t available, he would give Liang\u00a0Guang\u00a0the wooden peach sword. After all, magical weapons weren\u2019t as important as one\u2019s life.\u00a0Fortunately, he had good fortune. The Deity was online and agreed.So just now, he was able to\u00a0energetically\u00a0stand up\u00a0tall\u00a0in front of Liang\u00a0Guang, his most hated person.=In the\u00a0Lou\u00a0family\u2019s courtyard, Lou Ming, the important person, was on the phone with the\u00a0Headmaster\u00a0of Imperial Capital University.\u201cYes, the time is fine. Let\u2019s make it Friday.\u201d Lou Ming nodded.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about\u00a0this that I suddenly changed the time.\u201d The\u00a0Headmaster\u00a0apologized, \u201cIt\u2019s mainly because I\u2019ll be attending an academic conference in Country M next week. It will take me a month to return and I really don\u2019t want to miss out on your lecture.\u201d\u201cHeadmaster, you\u2019re too polite. It\u2019s\u00a0an honor for you to come listen to my lecture.\u201d\u00a0Lou Ming said modestly.\u201cDon\u2019t say that to me. I know your accomplishments.\u201d The Headmaster asked again, \u201cIs the lecture ready for tomorrow?\u201dLou Ming glanced at the\u00a0lecture\u00a0on the computer: \u201cIt\u2019s almost done. I\u2019ll be done by tomorrow.\u201d\u201dOkay, then I won\u2019t disturb you. You must\u00a0be done with the lecture\u00a0quickly.\u201d The\u00a0Headmaster said and hung up the phone.Lou Ming smiled\u00a0and\u00a0put his cellphone aside. He turned around and selected five or six reference books from the bookshelf behind him. He planned to take them to the villa at\u00a0Xiaohan\u00a0Mountain tomorrow.\u201cThird young master.\u201d He Qi said. He changed shifts with his previous\u00a0assistant,\u00a0and they walked to the study together.In order to avoid being affected by Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirits, Minister Lou provided Lou Ming with seven assistants. Each of whom only worked one day a week\u00a0while they used their time off eliminating the evil spirits\u2019 contagion.\u201cBack?\u201d Lou Ming asked He Qi to send someone to\u00a0Qingmu\u00a0Province to find Chen Yu\u2019s grandfather. The person they sent\u00a0wasn\u2019t able to\u00a0find him, so He Qi went there personally a week ago.\u201dYes.\u201d Because\u00a0this matter couldn\u2019t be discovered by\u00a0Minister Lou, He Qi didn\u2019t come to make his report to Lou Ming until\u00a0today\u2019s shift change. \u201cI personally went to\u00a0Damu\u00a0Village. It\u2019s true that Wu Lao is no longer in the village.\u201d\u201dNo longer?\u201d Lou Ming wondered.\u00a0\u201cWhy does a man who has lived in\u00a0Damu\u00a0Village for more than a decade suddenly disappear when we\u00a0are looking for him?\u201d\u201cThe Village Head said, \u2018Wu Lao had long said he wanted to travel but because Chen Yu was still going to school, he wasn\u2019t at ease and waited. When Chen Yu left\u00a0Damu\u00a0Village, Wu Lao packed up and left within two days, but I\u00a0feel that this is strange.\u201d\u201cLater I went to check the\u00a0ticket\u00a0information at all the stations and there was no information of a Wu Lao.\u201d\u00a0He Qi said, \u201cI\u2019ll have people countrywide tomorrow\u2026\u201d2\u201dNo.\u201d Lou Ming placed the last book on the table and said, \u201cThe identity may also be fake. You don\u2019t even have a photo, so how can you investigate?\u201d\u201dI\u2026\u201d He Qi was stunned for a while. Indeed, there is no photo of Wu Lao from Damu Village. And the photos from the public security system are all old photos from decades ago which are totally different from his current appearance. What\u2019s more, the identity may also be fake.\u201cPack away these books and take them to\u00a0Xiaohan\u00a0Mountain tomorrow.\u201d Lou Ming just wanted to ask Wu Lao about the situation.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t a goal that needed to be achieved. If you can\u2019t find him, then you can\u2019t find him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She dodged the patrolmen in the military camp and jumped over the wall.After running for five minutes, Chen Yu saw a taxi parked at the intersection. She opened the door and sat in it.\u201dMister, go to Xiaohan Mountain.\u201d Chen Yu called this car two hours in advance online. Otherwise, it would be difficult to get a taxi in the suburbs at night.\u201dOkay.\u201d The taxi driver started his car and drove all the way to the destination. Because it was already after 10pm, the Imperial Capital had no traffic congestion. When the car arrived at Xiaohan Mountain, it was ten minutes earlier than what Chen Yu expected.\u201cMister, can you wait an hour here for me. I will come down in an hour.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cThen I will go ahead and leave to get something to eat. I\u2019ll pick you up in an hour.\u201d When they arrived, the driver saw a small restaurant in front of him. He was a little hungry. He wanted to go over and get something to eat.\u201dOkay.\u201d It\u2019s better if mister driver wasn\u2019t present. Although it\u2019s still quite a distance from the center of the yin energy, after fighting for a while, the malevolent ghost will be very troublesome if it notices that someone is over here and comes running.After getting out of the car, Chen Yu stood at the foot of the mountain and raised her eyes. She saw a thick cloud of yin energy floating in the woods. This arrogant malevolent ghost was there so she didn\u2019t even need to open her yin yang eyes to find it.Ding!Chen Yu, who heard the phone ringing, took out her phone to check.March Floating Rain: Is Deity finished?Of course, Chen Yu, who had just arrived at her destination, was definitely not done. So, she politely asked: Why must it be done before twelve o\u2019clock?March Floating Rain: Because there is a very important person who is going to stay in Xiaohan Mountain at midnight. If he meets a malevolent ghost, this brother will die.It turned out that someone came to stay here. He was afraid that the other party will encounter the malevolent ghost. However, there was no time for it to find other people with her here, so Chen Yu replied with great confidence: Let him come.March Floating Rain: Done? Brother, did you do it?I Want To Fix Road: En. (I\u2019ll get it done right away)Chen Yu put away her cellphone and accelerated her steps to go up the mountain.=In the Liang family\u2019s old house, Liang Guang reminded his cousin Liang Yu again in the presence of Old Man Liang: \u201cLiang Yu, it\u2019s time that you stop pushing yourself. Third young master is almost at Xiaohan Mountain. Now, it\u2019s too late to tell the truth.\u201dLiang Yu put down his cellphone and pretended to be stupid: \u201cWhat do you mean cousin? What truth can I tell you?\u201dLiang Guang saw Liang Yu didn\u2019t shed tears in his coffin, so he directly exposed him: \u201cWhen I went to Xiaohan Mountain in the afternoon, you didn\u2019t expel that malevolent ghost.\u201dOld Man Liang scowled.\u201dGrandpa, I\u2019ve removed that malevolent ghost.\u201d Liang Yu quickly explained.\u201dImpossible. I was there when I went in the afternoon.\u201d Liang Guang said, \u201cGrandpa, you\u2019d better call third young master and tell them not to go. If something goes wrong, it will cause trouble. The malevolent ghost\u2019s mind has been swallowed by resentment.\u201d\u201dLiang Yu, did you take care of the malevolent ghost or not? Now it\u2019s too late.\u201d Old Man Liang asked Liang Yu after weighing the options for a moment.\u201dGrandpa, you believe me. I really got rid of that malevolent ghost.\u201d Liang Yu said affirmatively.\u201dAre you sure?\u201d\u201dI\u2019m sure!\u201d Liang Yu replied confidently.Old Man Liang stared at Liang Yu for two seconds while Liang Yu stared back without hesitation. Finally, Old Man Liang chose to believe Liang Yu\u2019s words and didn\u2019t call to stop Lou Ming from going to Xiaohan Mountain.\u201dGrandpa, just in case\u2026\u201d Liang Guang kept staring at Liang Yu. He was 100% sure that Liang Yu never went to Xiaohan Mountain. Although he wanted to take the wooden peach sword from Liang Yu, he didn\u2019t expect him to take human lives as a joke instead.\u201dIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Old Man Liang waved his hand. Actually, the purpose of getting rid of the, malevolent ghost wasn\u2019t because they were afraid that malevolent ghost would hurt Lou Ming but because the evil spirits in Lou Ming will amplify the malevolent ghost\u2019s powers. If the malevolent ghost isn\u2019t eliminated, then he will personally go there tomorrow.=Five minutes later, Lou Ming\u2019s car reached Xiaohan Mountain. In order to prevent people from accidentally entering Xiaohan Mountain, Assistant Tian Fei ordered people to set up a barricade at the entrance at the foot of the mountain to prohibit vehicles and pedestrians from entering.Lou Ming walked into the villa, raised his hand to look at the time, and turned back to Tian Fei: \u201cAt ten past twelve, you all retreat to the foot of the mountain.\u201d\u201dYes.\u201d Tian Fei brought the books and computers that Lou Ming packed on the coffee table in the living room. Then went to the kitchen to boil a pot of water. After making a cup of tea for Lou Ming, Tian Fei turned around and left the villa.But in the woods that was only a hundred meters away from the villa, Chen Yu just entered. Almost at the moment when she stepped into the woods, she foresaw danger. She took out a primary expelling talisman from her back. A flash of fire let Chen Yu see the appearance of the malevolent ghost. It was a male ghost with disheveled hair and tusks. His eyes were shining green and had no consciousness at all.The three immortal souls and seven mortal forms have already been swallowed by resentment. This kind of malevolent ghost had no human nature. If it wasn\u2019t expelled in time, it will eventually become a wicked evil that will bring disasters to humans. However, within a few seconds, Chen Yu made a decision. This malevolent ghost couldn\u2019t be sent to the Underworld, so she will destroy it on the spot.\u201dRise!\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s right hand threw six primary expelling talismans in the air. The expelling talismans instantly formed a spirit trapping array and trapped the malevolent ghost in the center of the array. Her left hand immediately tried to stick on a piece of intermediate expelling talisman.\u201dCrack, bang.\u201d With a loud noise, the malevolent ghost spread its hands to open the spirit trapping array and the ghost disappeared after a flash. Chen Yu\u2019s intermediate expelling talisman was pasted on empty space.It\u2019s pretty good!\u201dOpen!\u201dChen Yu\u2019s fingers were at the center of her brow. She opened her yin yang eyes, glanced around and soon found the malevolent ghost lying on a tree quietly observing her. It was in the 10 o\u2019clock direction in front of her. Chen Yu raised her hand to throw the intermediate expelling talisman. The malevolent ghost snarled and used his own yin energy to set up a barrier to block the expelling talisman. The talisman was fixed on the yin energy barrier and couldn\u2019t go further.\u201dBoom.\u201dChen Yu pinched the formation with her fingers and the expelling talisman attached to the yin energy barrier immediately shattered. A dazzling aura accompanied by a powerful spiritual energy broke through the yin energy barrier and fell on the face of the malevolent ghost. After the malevolent ghost screamed, he seemed to be enraged and rushed towards Chen Yu frantically.Chen Yu took a step back, slipped by mistake and seized the arm of the malevolent ghost who attacked her. The dark fingernails were less than 10cm away from Chen Yu\u2019s eyes. After a while, the cold yin energy aura passed into Chen Yu\u2019s body through the body of the malevolent ghost. Chen Yu quickly used her spiritual energy.\u201cI have seen a lot of malevolent ghosts, but never one as miserable as you. You can\u2019t get revenge nor can you reincarnate. Is this worth the trouble?\u201dThese kinds of malevolent spirit were usually formed due to their misery before death, thus bearing a grudge after. The resentment was too heavy. It was unwilling to leave but unable to get revenge, so it began to hurt innocent people. The more people it hurt, the stronger the resentment. And their strength feeds on their own growing resentment. But naturally, its fragile will couldn\u2019t control such strength and would eventually be controlled by their grudge. Its soul became nourishment for the resentment and died again in that sense.\u201dWawawa!!\u201d1Chen Yu mobilized her whole body\u2019s spiritual power and directly poured it into the malevolent ghost through the hand holding its arm. The malevolent ghost shrieked in pain but couldn\u2019t break away from Chen Yu\u2019s grip. The pitch-black yin energy collided with the golden spiritual energy, forming a strange space in the woods. Finally, the golden spiritual energy slowly suppressed the pitch-black yin energy and the solid soul of the malevolent ghost became transparent little by little, slowly dissipating\u2026At this time, blood-red evil spirits suddenly came. It overwhelmingly broke the space formed by the yin and spiritual energy. The malevolent ghost who was about to disappear was suddenly stimulated. It came back to life and raised its other arm to quickly catch Chen Yu.Chen Yu was caught off guard and scratched on the arm.\u201dWhere did those evil spirits come from?\u201d Chen Yu stepped back and looked up outside the woods.\u201dHu!\u201d The malevolent ghost hated this human who almost killed it this time. After absorbing the evil spirits, its strength increased three or four folds. It rushed to Chen Yu with all its might.Chen Yu evaded the danger, hurriedly took out the compass from the bag, raised her hand and threw it. The compass radiated with a bright light and directly hit the chest of the malevolent ghost. She only heard a buzzing sound and the malevolent ghost froze for a while. Chen Yu took advantage of the malevolent ghost\u2019s inaction and pasted an advanced expelling talisman on the malevolent ghost\u2019s head. Her hands formed an array, attracting spiritual energy.\u201dBang!\u201dWith a loud noise, the just arrogant malevolent ghost was instantly annihilated and became ash. It dissipated in the empty air together with the rich yin energy.Chen Yu retrieved her compass, sat on the grass, and looked at the increasingly rich blood-red evil spirits around her. She was puzzled. When she first arrived, there were no evil spirits. Why did such strong evil spirits suddenly appear, and still blood-red? Was there a zombie nearby?Chen Yu rested for a moment and decided to find the source of these evil spirits. If it\u2019s a zombie, then it couldn\u2019t be ignored.\u201dHiss\u2026\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s arm hurt. She turned her head and saw her scratched arm and her face suddenly became livid. She was actually hurt by a century-old malevolent ghost. If the old man found out about it, he will joke about it for the rest of her life.Chen Yu walked out of the woods and walked to the densest area of evil spirits. She soon saw a brightly lit villa. At the moment of seeing the villa, Chen Yu\u2019s brain unconsciously thought of the man she met at Imperial Capital University. After all, there weren\u2019t many people with evil spirits, and he was the only one she met.Chen Yu thought about it, put away the talisman paper in her hand, then went to the villa door and rang the doorbell.Lou Ming, who was revising materials, suddenly heard the doorbell and put down his pen in surprise. His first thought was that no one should be nearby at this time, but curiosity drove him to open the door. When he saw the girl outside the door from the monitor, Lou Ming\u2019s brow furrowed further.\u201dClick!\u201dWhen the door was opened, Chen Yu pushed open the courtyard door and walked all the way into the living room. When she saw the blood-red evil spirits emitting from his body, it looked like the whole person was floating in a blood-red sea. She immediately pointed to the other person and angrily said, \u201cIt\u2019s really you!\u201d\u201dWhy are you here?\u201d Lou Ming asked at the same time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lou Ming then turned around and sat on the chair opposite of her at the dining table.\u201cDid you know that I was almost killed by you just now when that huge stream of evil spirits suddenly appeared?\u201d Chen Yu took a sip of the watermelon juice and didn\u2019t wipe her mouth. She lowered her head and continued to eat the soft sandwich.En, she was eating messily but Chen Yu was having a good time. The salad dressing mixed with the watermelon juice on her face looked funny.Lou Ming looked at the little girl eating in front of him with a smile. But his face suddenly changed after he heard her words. He stood up and hurriedly went back to the living room and put on the jade clasp that he removed back on his wrist. The whole person was very upset. How could he carelessly forget about his special physique? He wasn\u2019t wearing the jade clasp and hung around that silly girl for so long, he wasn\u2019t sure if she was affected.No, he must send her away immediately.Lou Ming thought about it. He walked back to the dining room again and was about to open his mouth to tell Chen Yu to leave. But when he saw Chen Yu suddenly turned around and said with a disgusted face, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of putting away the evil spirits now? I\u2019ve already gotten rid of that malevolent ghost and it won\u2019t affect me.\u201d\u201dAffect\u2026it won\u2019t affect you?\u201d Lou Ming was surprised, \u201cYou mean my evil spirits won\u2019t affect you?\u201d\u201dNonsense.\u201d Originally, military training consumed physical strength. But after another fierce battle, Chen Yu was hungry. She ate three sandwiches and drank a mouthful of watermelon juice. She patted her chest and continued, \u201cI\u2019m a great exorcist expert. If I\u2019m so easily affected by evil spirits, what kind of ghosts can I catch?\u201dLou Ming\u2019s expression was full of surprise, since he understood his special body constitution, he has never met a person who wasn\u2019t afraid of the evil spirits on his body. Even Master Mao, a profound master of metaphysics, can only stay by his side longer than ordinary people. It wasn\u2019t good for his health if it was any longer.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you last time? Be careful that I catch you.\u201d Chen Yu swallowed the last bit of her sandwich. She grabbed a napkin, wiped her hands, looked at Lou Ming and said, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t carry evil spirits on you, how can I catch you?\u201dLou Ming\u2019s expression gradually became more and more complicated. He silently unfastened the jade clasp he just put on and placed it on the dining room table.Chen Yu glanced at the jade clasp. Although she was curious, she didn\u2019t reach for it, instead she continued to wipe her mouth with a tissue.\u201dYou just said, you caught a malevolent ghost near here?\u201d Lou Ming sat across from Chen Yu again.\u201dThat\u2019s right!\u201d Speaking of this ah, Chen Yu angrily said, \u201cI was just behind the villa, in the woods behind the villa. I just restrained the malevolent ghost and was about to exorcist it. But a burst of evil spirits came over, do you know what happened?\u201dLou Ming shook his head silently.\u201cThat malevolent ghost absorbed the evil spirits, those same evil spirits you released.\u201d Chen Yu pointed out this key point, \u201cIt was dying, but suddenly became lively again. Look, look at my arm.\u201dChen Yu showed her injured arm to the other person: \u201cLook at the good things you did.\u201dLou Ming saw the claw marks on Chen Yu\u2019s arm and frowned. He was about to reach out to check the other person\u2019s injury, but saw Chen Yu withdrew her arm and angrily said, \u201cHow will you compensate me?\u201d\u201dCompensate?\u201d Lou Ming asked with doubt.\u201dYes!\u201d\u201dHow do you want me to compensate?\u201d Lou Ming raised an eyebrow and asked with interest.\u201cI haven\u2019t figured it out yet. I\u2019ll let you know once I think about it.\u201d Chen Yu said casually. If you really wanted to ask her how to compensate, she really didn\u2019t think about it.\u201dOkay, when you think of it, you can come see me anytime you want, but\u2026\u201d Lou Ming looked at Chen Yu and calmly said, \u201cFirst, let\u2019s define responsibility.\u201d\u201dDefine responsibility?\u201d Chen Yu blinked in bewilderment.\u201dFirst of all,\u201d Lou Ming asked Chen Yu, \u201cWhy would a student who should be training in the military camp suddenly appear here in the middle of the night?\u201d\u201dHiccup!\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but hiccup nervously.\u201cSecondly, although I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here to exorcist malevolent ghosts. But I requested all the evil things to be rid of around Xiaohan Mountain before midnight tonight.\u201d Lou Ming pointed to the jade clasp and continued, \u201cWhen I took off the jade clasp, it was already 12:10.\u201d\u201dHiccup!\u201d Chen Yu covered her mouth and leaned back with guilt.\u201cIn the end, this is my home. I stayed in my home. You suddenly come and criticized me. What do you call this? When people sit in their homes and trouble falls from the sky. Tell me.\u201d Lou Ming had both hands on his chest, leaned on the chair and smiled at the little girl who had a guilty look across the dining table.Chen Yu\u2019s guilty eyes flickered and was stunned.It\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. I should have thought about this beforehand. March Floating Rain said that an important person will come stay here. There\u2019s such a villa on Xiaohan Mountain. It must be the person in front of me who was staying here.She couldn\u2019t get rid of the malevolent ghost before midnight. No one must discover this matter, but her braindead-self had delivered this information right to this person\u2019s door.\u00a0If March Floating Rain finds out, I won\u2019t be able to get the final payment of 2.2 million ah.1Lou Ming saw the little girl\u2019s face was white with fear. He couldn\u2019t bear it and said, \u201cForget it. I won\u2019t care about you this time. I\u2019ll help you deal with the wound and let someone send you down the mountain.\u201d\u201dYou really\u2026\u201d Chen Yu was about to ask if the other party really didn\u2019t care but her cellphone suddenly dinged in her pocket. Chen Yu had to answer the phone first.\u201cAfter you answer the phone, come to the living room.\u201d With that, Lou Ming got up and went to the living room.When Chen Yu finished using her phone, she walked to the living room. Lou Ming had found a first aid kit and placed it on the coffee table. When Chen Yu came over, he said, \u201cSit here and take off your coat.\u201d\u201dOh.\u201d This person had a handle on the 2.2 million yuan and Chen Yu immediately became more obedient.2Under her thin coat, she wore a white short-sleeved T-shirt. On the girl\u2019s fair skin that swelled, there was two dark bloodstains that looked particularly striking.\u201dWhy is it black?\u201d Lou Ming asked with a frown.\u201dIt\u2019s resentment, malevolent ghosts have resentment tinged in their energy,\u201d Chen Yu explained.\u201dHow to deal with it?\u201d He can deal with ordinary wounds, but he didn\u2019t know how to deal with wounds caused by energy full of resentment.\u201dIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll clean it up.\u201d Chen Yu said, lifting her right palm and placed it over the wound. A light spiritual energy appeared to dispel the resentment energy around the wound. Shortly, the black wound, which was eye-catching, became a normal blood-red color.Although he knew that the little girl had some skills before, Lou Ming, who saw this scene with his own eyes was stupefied. But a moment later, he picked up a cotton ball to help Chen Yu clean the wound.\u201dThen\u2026that\u2026you just said that someone will send me back.\u201d Chen Yu quietly asked for confirmation.\u201dEn.\u201d Lou Ming replied softly while cleaning the wound.\u201dThat\u2019s good.\u201d Chen Yu breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cI just received a call from the driver uncle. He said that the road under the mountain was suddenly blocked. If he couldn\u2019t get in, then he would go back first. If you didn\u2019t send me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend tomorrow\u2019s military training.\u201dLou Ming\u2019s hand was still on the medicine and asked with a frown: \u201cYou still have to rush back and participate in tomorrow\u2019s military training?\u201d\u201dEn.\u201d Chen Yu nodded.\u201dYou secretly snuck out from the wall tonight?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201dHow do you know that I came out from the wall?\u201d Chen Yu was surprised.Because the first wall you jumped over was in my yard.\u201cMake an excuse to ask for leave tomorrow, don\u2019t go to military training.\u201d After cleaning the wound, Lou Ming began to bandage the little girl.\u201dIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just a small injury.\u201d Chen Yu said indifferently.\u201dThen I will ask someone to help you.\u201d Lou Ming found that the little girl hasn\u2019t settled down since she returned to the Imperial Capital.Ask someone to help me? What do you mean? Is it someone who will take me back and ask for leave? Then wouldn\u2019t the thing of me sneaking out in the middle of the night be discovered?\u201dNo, no, I\u2019ll ask for leave, please\u2026\u201d Chen Yu shook her head excitedly.\u201dDon\u2019t move!\u201d Lou Ming pressed the little girl\u2019s disorderly arm, wrapped the gauze properly before releasing his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll ask?\u201d\u201dEn!\u201d Chen Yu was afraid to death. If they told the teacher she fled military training and people found out that she fled by jumping the wall at the military camp, this would become a big thing.\u201dThey can\u2019t go up the mountain. After a while, you go down the mountain first. Someone will take you back at the intersection.\u201d Lou Ming pack up the first aid kit and stood up to put it back in the drawer.Chen Yu moved her bandaged arm and found that it didn\u2019t hurt anymore. She put on her coat again and walked behind Lou Ming to thank him: \u201cThank you ah! Well, I still don\u2019t know what to call you. You see, we\u2019ve met each other twice in such a short time. Let\u2019s get to know each other.\u201dLou Ming turned around.\u201dLet me introduce myself first. My name is Chen Yu with the character from carp fish. You can also call me Xishi or Meiren\u2026\u201d Chen Yu introduced herself.\u201dMeiren?\u201d Lou Ming repeated incredulously.\u201dEn?\u201d Chen Yu responded very consciously.\u201dCough\u2026\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help himself. He turned around to support himself with the cupboard and bent over with a smile.\u201cAh, right, a man shouldn\u2019t call out Meiren,3\u00a0so it\u2019s better to call me Xishi, otherwise you\u2019ll sound like a rogue.\u201d Chen Yu added.Lou Ming\u2019s hands holding the cupboard trembled from laughter. It took him a long time before he calmed down.\u201dThen what\u2019s your name ah?\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but take the initiative to ask him when she saw that the other person was ignoring her.\u201dLou Ming.\u201d Lou Ming finally calmed down from his laughing fit and turned to look at the little girl who only reached his chin. \u201cYou can call me third brother.\u201d\u201dLou Ming, this name seems familiar.\u201d Chen Yu thought about it. After three seconds, her eyes suddenly lit up, she pointed her finger at Lou Ming, trembled and stammered, \u201cAh, you\u2019re that\u2026that courtyard, that courtyard to the north of the compound.\u201dLou Ming looked at the little girl who was shocked.\u201dAlso, you sent me a doll, right, a bear.\u201d Chen Yu asked.Lou Ming nodded with a smile.\u201dIt\u2019s really you?\u201d Chen Yu asked incredulously.\u201dIt\u2019s me.\u201d Lou Ming nodded again.\u201dThird Brother!\u201d Chen Yu pounced on him, hugged someone\u2019s arm without letting go. Her eyes blinked like a puppy and sold meng.4Lou third brother raised his eyebrows in surprise, but he didn\u2019t shake her off.Author\u2019s Notes:Today, I saw a little angel suggesting that I change my name\u2026Cough\u2026 Actually, crabs often have this urge,But\u2026Crabs isn\u2019t a good name. So far, I still haven\u2019t thought of a suitable name. What should I do? (Who can help me\u2026\u2026)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, this feeling of being intimately held by the arm made him feel novelty. Because of this, he didn\u2019t avoid the little girl.\u201cThird brother, it turns out we live so close to each other ah.\u201d Chen Yu continued to cling on him.1Lou Ming felt the temperature passed from the other person\u2019s palm to his arm for a while. He was stunned and gently pried away his arm: \u201cEn.\u201d\u201dThen why did you suddenly come here today?\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s eyes spun and asked, \u201cI remember your spiritual energy is very rich.\u201dSomehow, when Lou Ming heard this, his first thought was someone secretly burying the compass in the middle of the night.\u201dThis is my safe house.\u201d Lou Ming explained.\u201dSafe house?\u201d Chen Yu was puzzled.\u201cThe evil spirits on me grows every day. If I let them grow, they will get out of control to some extent.\u201d When speaking about getting out of control, Lou Ming\u2019s face tightened.Chen Yu naturally knows the consequences of uncontrollable evil spirits. She frowned: \u201cIs your condition already so critical? I\u2019ve seen you twice. While it is serious, it hasn\u2019t gotten to the point of being uncontrollable.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because I release the evil spirits at certain times.\u201d Lou Ming continued, \u201cLast time at Imperial Capital University, I used the auspicious aura to block the evil spirits every year. Then again here.\u201dLou Ming look around the villa and continued, \u201cThere are no people living around Xiaohan Mountain within a 5km radius. This place is where I release evil spirits periodically. There are two or three such places that I will come and stay for several days every once in a while.\u201d\u201cThe road down the mountain was also closed off by you?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201dEn.\u201d Lou Ming nodded.\u201cYou had someone blocked the road and had people perform an exorcism. In fact, you\u2019re afraid of hurting others.\u201d At this point, Chen Yu suddenly thought of when she yelled at Lou Ming at school that day to stop him from walking around and harming people. She immediately felt ashamed and said, \u201cThat\u2026that day\u2026I\u2019m sorry ah.\u201dLou Ming raised his eyebrows, pretended, and asked, \u201cWhat day?\u201d\u201cThat day, that day at school.\u201d Chen Yu was embarrassed and continued, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that to you.\u201d\u201dOh.\u201d Lou Ming said, and his eyes were \u2018suddenly enlightened\u2019, \u201cYou said you would catch me that day.\u201dChen Yu suddenly blushed: \u201cI said that, something that embarrassing that day?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cI just saw you appear outside the villa and thought you came to catch me. I was really shocked.\u201d\u201cI came to scare you. If there\u2019s no payment, then naturally I won\u2019t do it.\u201d Chen Yu explained.\u201cSo that day, you asked me, a client, for money then drew a calming spirit talisman to treat me?\u201d Lou Ming raised an eyebrow.\u201dOh, didn\u2019t I say it was a misunderstanding ah?\u201d Chen Yu found that Lou Ming still held a grudge regarding the matter of that day. She immediately asked with some anger, \u201cYou\u2019re still bothered about what happened that day? Then, I\u2019ll just return the pen to you.\u201dLou Ming looked at the little girl who was flattering him a moment ago suddenly become angry. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh. As expected, she was still a child and couldn\u2019t control her emotions.\u201dNo.\u201d Lou Ming said, \u201cOn the contrary, I want to pay you another sum of money.\u201d\u201dWhy?\u201d Chen Yu wondered, \u201cWhat can I do for you? Catch ghosts? Or like today, help you remove malevolent ghosts outside your safe house?\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201d Lou Ming shook his head and said seriously, \u201cI want to ask you, that if one day I lose control of the evil spirits. Please come and catch me.\u201dChen Yu blinked, and looked up at the pair of calm eyes and suddenly realized: \u201cYou want me to help suppress your evil spirits.\u201dLooking at Chen Yu\u2019s lively appearance, Lou Ming felt that there\u2019s something wrong, but he couldn\u2019t tell what was wrong and nodded.\u201cLet me tell you. I charge a lot. Oh, especially if it\u2019s as heavy as your evil spirits.\u201d Chen Yu blinked her pair of big eyes for fear that others would notice what she was doing.Lou Ming\u2019s mood was heavy just now but wanted to smile now because of her expression. So, she waited for the other party to blackmail him with interest: \u201cThen you set the offer price and I\u2019ll see if I can afford it.\u201d\u201cAh look, your evil spirits grow every day. That\u2019s to say, I may have to help you quell them often.\u201d Chen Yu pointed out the seriousness of the problem first.Lou Ming was dumbfounded,\u00a0did she actually meant what she said?\u201cSo, you often have to ask me to help quell your evil spirits. The cost isn\u2019t small ah.\u201d Chen Yu continued, \u201cBut, we aren\u2019t strangers.\u201dBut I only seen you twice before?\u201cYou\u2019re still a neighbor and even gave me a gift. My mother said we met when we were young.\u201dSo?\u201dSo, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s okay?\u201dLou Ming saw the little girl was beating around the bush for a long time and finally reached this key point. He cooperated with her and asked, \u201cHow?\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t be for free, but\u2026 \u2026 cough\u2026 can you let me go to your house often to replenish spiritual energy?\u201d Chen Yu has long thought about it. She would only need to help Lou Ming a few times a year at most, but if she could take her compass to the other party\u2019s yard to replenish its spiritual energy. This was way better as she could make money by drawing more expelling talisman ah.As expected, it was the spiritual energy in his courtyard. Lou Ming wasn\u2019t surprised at all.\u201cIn fact, this deal has no losses for you. Just think of it as a friend coming over to your house to play.\u201d Chen Yu looked expectantly at Lou Ming.How many friends come over to my house to play?\u00a0Lou Ming was stunned. He turned his head to the little girl\u2019s bright eyes. His mood a little complicated.One more friend?Ding ling ling\u2026The sudden cellphone ring broke the silence in the house. Lou Ming recovered to his senses and raised his hand to answer the phone. Assistant Tian Fei\u2019s voice came from the other end: \u201cThird young master, Chen family\u2019s miss hasn\u2019t come down the mountain yet. Is there something wrong?\u201d\u201dIt\u2019s okay, she will be down in a while.\u201d Lou Ming said. He put the phone down again, raised his hand to look at the time and found that it was almost 2am. He said to Chen Yu, \u201cYou should go, otherwise it will be dawn.\u201d\u201dThen\u2026 that\u2026\u201d Chen Yu carefully tried to hook him, \u201cCan I have your phone number or WeChat so I can send you a message before I go over to your house?\u201dIs this a tacit agreement?\u00a0Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. He couldn\u2019t resist the temptation from the bottom of his heart and gave Chen Yu his phone number and WeChat.For more than 20 years, the only friend who wasn\u2019t affected by his evil spirits and can touch him without hesitation, this is really a great temptation ah.Chen Yu left the villa with satisfaction and was sent back to the military camp by the car arranged by Lou Ming. Then, she slipped back into the dormitory by going over the wall.A week later, military training ended on National Day. Chen Yu didn\u2019t return to the school dormitory like the other students but instead went back home in the Imperial Capital.Mother Chen hasn\u2019t seen her daughter for nearly a month. She has already prepared a table full of delicious food for her. Originally, she thought that when her daughter returns from military training after a month, she was sure to be dark. But she didn\u2019t expect that when she sees her daughter again, she would be white instead. Mother Chen immediately was cheerful and exaggeratedly praised the value of the beauty card. Obviously giving credit of Chen Yu\u2019s whitening to the head of the beauty center.After dinner, Mother Chen was about to have a good chat with her daughter, but Chu Xiao suddenly came to find Chen Yu.Chen Yu looked strangely at Chu Xiao who suddenly came to her door. Although she met her at the racetrack before, Chen Yu didn\u2019t think their relationship was that good to hang out with each other.\u201dChu Xiao? You wanted to see me?\u201d Chen Yu asked strangely.\u201dEn.\u201d Chu Xiao hesitantly glanced at Mother Chen sitting on the side and whispered, \u201cSister Chen Yu, do you want to come over to my house?\u201d\u201dGo to your house?\u201d Chen Yu refused without hesitation. \u201cNo, I just finished my military training today. I\u2019m a little tired.\u201dWhen Chu Xiao heard Chen Yu refused, she anxiously said: \u201cThen\u2026then can you come outside with me for a moment?\u201dChen Yu looked at Chu Xiao with surprise.Chu Xiao approached Chen Yu and whispered, \u201cWenwen is outside.\u201dZhang Wenwen?\u00a0Chen Yu asked with confusion: \u201cWhy is she looking for me?\u201d\u201dDidn\u2019t you tell her last time that there was\u2026 something on her shoulder?\u201d When Chu Xiao mentioned this, her voice was unconsciously lowered.That drowning ghost?\u00a0Chen Yu raised her eyebrows in surprise,\u00a0is it still on Zhang Wenwen\u2019s shoulder?Unable to resist her curiosity, Chen Yu followed Chu Xiao out of the yard. There was a black car beside the small yard. She saw Zhang Wenwen, who was somewhat thin and out of it. She had a pale face and thick black circles around her eyes. She looked scarier than the drowning ghost that was still on her shoulder.Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but frown when she saw Zhang Wenwen: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cEn, en.\u201d Zhang Wenwen anxiously en twice. Then took out her cellphone and typed quickly, then finally displayed the screen to Chen Yu.Chen Yu glanced at the phone but didn\u2019t carefully read the words. Instead, in front of the two\u2019s puzzled eyes, she raised her hand and pulled away the hand that tightly covered Zhang Wenwen\u2019s mouth.\u201dNow you can talk.\u201d Chen Yu said.Zhang Wenwen only felt her mouth loosen. She tried to open her mouth and made two sounds. She found that she could really talk and immediately weep, \u2018wa\u2019.Chu Xiao saw that Chen Yu raised her hand and took something off from Zhang Wenwen\u2019s head and Zhang Wenwen was suddenly able to speak again. She immediately felt that her back was chilly and couldn\u2019t help but take a step back.\u201dDon\u2019t cry, if you cry again, I\u2019ll leave.\u201d Chen Yu said helplessly.\u201dI\u2026I\u2026\u201d Zhang Wenwen stopped crying and whispered, \u201cSister Chen Yu, can you help me, help me send him away?\u201dChen Yu\u2019s eyes turned to Zhang Wenwen\u2019s shoulders where a little boy was lying. At that moment, he looked at her with vigilance. Seeing this scene, Chen Yu\u2019s eyebrows wrinkled again. The last time the child saw her, he was still in a state of ignorance and unconscious. He would have naturally returned to the Underworld in about three or five days. But how come he hasn\u2019t disappeared after a month? Not only that, but he also had violent energy.\u201dWhat did you do to him?\u201d Chen Yu looked at Zhang Wenwen.Author\u2019s Notes:Xishi: There are people who have taken the initiative to bet money on me to catch him this year?Three young master: Come and catch me!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Originally, the child unexpectedly died in this life. In the next life, he would have been a good baby. But if she guided him to the Underworld, how can he be a good baby in his next life.\u201dWhat the hell did you do to him?\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s voice was cold.\u201dHe\u2026 is he still there?\u201d Zhang Wenwen said with a pale face, \u201cIt\u2019s him. It\u2019s the little demon who won\u2019t let me talk, right?\u201d\u201dYes, he covered your mouth with his hand.\u201d Chen Yu simply told the truth. Anyway, Zhang Wenwen self-inflicted this disaster.\u201dQuickly kill him, kill him.\u201d Zhang Wenwen thought of the drowned ghost on her shoulder that covered her mouth with his hand, she was frightened to death.Chen Yu glanced at the little guy on Zhang Wenwen\u2019s shoulder, who was just watching her vigilantly. At this moment, when he heard Zhang Wenwen\u2019s words Chen Yu\u2019s eyes suddenly changed as his whole body began to emit faint black energy.\u201dShut up!\u201d Chen Yu interrupted the shouting Zhang Wenwen, \u201cIf you shout again, believe it or not, he will cover both your nose and mouth.\u201dIf her nose and mouth was covered, wouldn\u2019t she be smothered to death? Realizing this, Zhang Wenwen\u2019s screams seemed to be choked by someone. She stared with a pair of frightened eyes and didn\u2019t dare to make another sound.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t let her hurt you again.\u201d Chen Yu suddenly said.Zhang Wenwen looked at Chen Yu gratefully: \u201cThen\u2026 then you\u2026 can you send him away?\u201d\u201dNot you.\u201d Chen Yu waved her hand in disgust and turned to look at Zhang Wenwen\u2019s right shoulder. She then said to the little boy that was full of distrust, \u201cShe won\u2019t hurt you anymore.\u201dThe little boy blinked as if thinking about something. He remembered this big sister. A month ago, this big sister saw him and smiled, unlike other people it met later who always bullied him. The little boy thought about it and chose to believe her. She was the only one who could see him and has never hurt him. He was already reaching for Zhang Wenwen\u2019s hand but slowly withdrew it and the black energy on his body gradually disappeared.Chen Yu was relieved and turned to look at the trembling Zhang Wenwen: \u201cWhat the hell did you do to him? If you don\u2019t say it, then I won\u2019t care about you.\u201d\u201dI\u2026I\u2026\u201d Zhang Wenwen\u2019s face was frightened. She just felt a chill on her neck, as if something was near her neck. Just now, when Chen Yu said that the little ghost was going to suffocate her. Zhang Wenwen was so scared that she couldn\u2019t speak clearly. She could only look at Chu Xiao for help.Chu Xiao watched for a long time. Judging from Chen Yu\u2019s actions just now, she seemed to be able to see the drowned ghost. Otherwise, how could she tell at a glance that Wenwen did something to that drowned ghost. These days, she has been inseparable from Zhang Wenwen. Thinking about it, Chu Xiao was also afraid for a while.\u201dWenwen, Wenwen found a few Heavenly Masters who wanted to\u2026 help Zhang Xiaobin find peace.\u201d Chu Xiao said with a trembling voice, Zhang Xiaobin was the name of the child on Zhang Wenwen\u2019s shoulder.\u201dHelp find peace?\u201d Chen Yu sneered. \u201cThe last time I saw him, he should have gone to the Underworld in a few days for reincarnation. So, there wasn\u2019t a need to find those profiteers to help him find peace.\u201d\u201dHe was going to be reincarnated?\u201d Zhang Wenwen\u2019s face was incredulous, \u201cI thought he was going to hurt me, so I, I\u2026\u201d\u201dYou have a guilty conscience.\u201d Chen Yu said bluntly.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. When I passed by the lake that day\u2026I didn\u2019t have good swimming skills, so I couldn\u2019t jump in to save him. Later, I found someone to save him, but he was no longer alive. I really, it wasn\u2019t intentional, I didn\u2019t mean to kill him, I didn\u2019t mean for him to die.\u201d Zhang Wenwen said while crying as she collapsed.Of course, Chen Yu knew that Zhang Xiaobin wasn\u2019t killed by Zhang Wenwen. She knew it when she first saw the ghost child hanging on her shoulder. Zhang Wenwen just happened to see the child while he was dying. The child\u2019s strong sense of survival caused his soul to unconsciously climb on Zhang Wenwen\u2019s shoulder. At that time, Zhang Wenwen, who found the drowning child, didn\u2019t return to his body after confirming the child\u2019s death. So, the ghost was unknowingly brought back by her.After a person\u2019s death they go through the seven sevens2, a Buddhist service for the auspicious reincarnation of the departed. But obviously, Zhang Wenwen didn\u2019t go to the child\u2019s home for that ceremony. The child couldn\u2019t find his way home and latched on Zhang Wenwen\u2019s shoulder. Originally, this didn\u2019t matter since after the seven sevens, the child would still return to the Underworld. However, Zhang Wenwen asked some Heavenly Masters to collect Zhang Xiaobin.If she had hired a powerful Heavenly Master, then Zhang Xiaobin would have been able to pass on. But she found a half-assed fake Heavenly Master. She didn\u2019t know what they did to anger Zhang Xiaobin.\u201cI\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m really wrong. Chen Yu, please help me. I beg you, have him let me go.\u201d Zhang Wenwen was really frightened to death this entire month. She had nightmares every night. It was the summer but her right shoulder was always cold. And later, Zhang Xiaobin covered her mouth so she couldn\u2019t even speak.Chen Yu raised her eyebrows. She really couldn\u2019t ignore it, not because of Zhang Wenwen but for Zhang Xiaobin. When the child died, he was only seven years old. It\u2019s a pity that he died. She couldn\u2019t watch him suffer because of Zhang Wenwen\u2019s karma.\u201dAre you asking me to expel ghosts?\u201d Chen Yu asked Zhang Wenwen.\u201dPlease, please, I will give you money.\u201d Zhang Wenwen nodded busily.\u201dOkay.\u201d Chen Yu directly quoted, \u201c200,000.\u201d3\u201dWhat? 200,000?\u201d Zhang Wenwen was incredulous. She has asked so many Heavenly Masters but the most expensive one was only 20,000.\u201dToo expensive?\u201d Chen Yu raised an eyebrow.\u201dNot expensive, not expensive.\u201d Zhang Wenwen was afraid that Chen Yu wouldn\u2019t help her if she thought it was too expensive, \u201cYou\u2026you help me find peace for him. I\u2019ll pay, I\u2019ll pay.\u201d\u201cPay me first.\u201d\u00a0I\u2019m not familiar with you so I can\u2019t have a running bill with you.\u201d\u2026\u201d Zhang Wenwen suffocated but she didn\u2019t dare refute her. She could only miserably say, \u201cThere\u2019s no available computer so it\u2019s not convenient for me to transfer money right now.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have a cellphone? You can pay me through Alipay.\u201d Don\u2019t think just because she\u2019s from the mountain means she doesn\u2019t use Alipay. Recently, in order to study how to sell talismans to make money, she studied Taobao for a while.4\u201d\u2026\u201d Zhang Wenwen didn\u2019t dare speak out in anger. She took out her cellphone and transferred all her money from her bank account to Alipay and found she only has 150,000. So, she looked up and stammered, \u201cOnly 150,000.\u201d\u201cAre you trying to bargain?\u201d Chen Yu frowned. She has been doing this for a long time and never encounter someone trying to bargain her.\u201dNo, no.\u201d When Zhang Wenwen saw Chen Yu frown, her heart trembled. She quickly asked Chu Xiao, \u201cXiao Xiao, you\u2026can you transfer me 50,000.\u201dWhat else can Chu Xiao say. She honestly took out her cellphone and transferred 50,000 yuan to Zhang Wenwen, who then transferred all the money to Chen Yu.After Chen Yu confirmed the amount, she put away her cellphone in her back pocket and began to deal with the little demon.Zhang Wenwen didn\u2019t see her draw talisman or chant mantras, instead she stood and chatted with the ghost with a smile on her face. Her hair was erect and didn\u2019t dare speak.\u201dXiaobin ah, your name is Xiaobin. You were wrong. But if you strangle her, you won\u2019t be able to reincarnate.\u201d\u201dI know, I know, this big sister is bad. She found some bad people to bully you, right?\u201d\u201cBut your behavior isn\u2019t smart. How can you put yourself at risk for other people\u2019s mistakes? Didn\u2019t the teacher teach you that you can\u2019t steal someone else\u2019s sugar just because yours was stolen, if you did it would make you a thief too.\u201d\u201dOkay, what do you want? I\u2019ll ask this big sister to do it for you, then can you leave her alone?\u201dChen Yu finished talking, then turned her head and glanced at Zhang Wenwen, who was too terrified to move.\u201dHe\u2026what does he want?\u201d Zhang Wenwen asked in sobs. In order to get rid of Zhang Xiaobin completely, Zhang Wenwen can accept any request.\u201dHe said he wanted to go home.\u201d Chen Yu replied.\u201dI\u2026 I\u2019ll take him back then go pray for him.\u201d Zhang Wenwen said immediately.Zhang Xiaobin was still on Zhang Wenwen\u2019s shoulder. His eyes brightened and the energy from his body dimmed.\u201cHe also said that you should participate in a hands-on activity to give assistance to the poor children in poverty-stricken mountain areas and donating your New Year\u2019s lucky money\u2026\u201d\u201dI\u2026 I will, I will help the children in the poverty-stricken mountain areas until he graduates from University.\u201d Zhang Wenwen didn\u2019t wait for Chen Yu to finish and immediately promised.5The little demon, Zhang Xiaobin, tilted his head in puzzlement. Why couldn\u2019t he remember that he requested her to participate in this activity?Chen Yu smiled at him, raised her hand and stroked the child\u2019s head. A faint spiritual force dispelled the child\u2019s violent energy and made his soul pure again.Zhang Xiaobin only felt his body relaxed and immediately smiled at Chen Yu sweetly. His pale cheeks turned rosy and he looked very cute.\u201dHe\u2026 does he have any other requirements?\u201d Zhang Wenwen saw Chen Yu smiling at the ghost on her shoulder and her spine became cold.\u201dNo.\u201d Chen Yu helped Zhang Xiaobin purify his negative energy so that he can leave when he wants to.\u201dThen\u2026 what should I do next?\u201d Zhang Wenwen asked.\u201cDidn\u2019t I just tell you everything?\u201d Chen Yu was confused,\u00a0isn\u2019t everything done?\u201dThat\u2019s it?\u201d Zhang Wenwen suddenly had the feeling that Chen Yu was lying to her. In the past, those Heavenly Masters were busy for half a day and couldn\u2019t solve the problem after a long time. But Chen Yu just said a few words?Chen Yu looked at Zhang Wenwen\u2019s skeptical expression, and after a moment of stupefaction, she suddenly felt blessed for remembering what the old man said to her before: \u201cGirl, I\u2019ll tell you ah. Some people in the world are more willing to believe those artificial actions than the truth. So, those fake Heavenly Masters who cheat others outside always like to mystify and act. I don\u2019t know, if they really met a malicious spirit, they will probably be treated as entertainment for those malicious spirits.\u201d\u201cAh, here\u2019s a talisman. Let me grab it for you.\u201d Chen Yu turned back to the house, took out a safety talisman from her sack and handed it to Zhang Wenwen. \u201cTake this talisman and when you\u2019ve done everything you promised to Zhang Xiaobin, he will naturally leave, and the talisman will turn gray.\u201d\u201dThat means\u2026 when this talisman turns gray, he\u2026he just left?\u201d Zhang Wenwen confirmed.\u201dEn.\u201d Chen Yu nodded. In fact, this talisman was useless, but Zhang Wenwen wouldn\u2019t feel at ease unless she had it.Zhang Wenwen folded the talisman, carefully carried it close on herself and drove away in a hurry.A piece of safety talisman earned her 200,000 yuan. Chen Yu took out her cellphone in a good mood and opened up WeChat to send Lou Ming a message: (Third brother, my military training is over. I\u2019ll go see you, ah, in the evening.)It\u2019s just the right time to add some spiritual energy to the compass. It should only need one night, but if it\u2019s not enough, I can go again tomorrow.Author\u2019s Notes:Third Young Master: Don\u2019t do things on your accord!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stared at his cellphone for a long time. A very strange feeling filled his heart, it was difficult to describe the mixed flavors.\u201dHe Qi.\u201d Lou Ming looked up and stopped He Qi who was cleaning the table.\u201dThird Young Master?\u201d He Qi stopped his movements and waited for the Third Young Master\u2019s instructions.\u201dIs there anything else to eat at home?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201dThird Young Master, you didn\u2019t have enough to eat?\u201d He Qi glanced at the leftover food on the table in confusion.\u201dNo, forget it\u2026\u201d Lou Ming sighed, \u201cYou go out and buy some food and drinks. Buy something that girls like to eat.\u201dGirls? Who?\u00a0He Qi was shocked, and his jaw dropped.Lou Ming knew that Chen Yu was coming so he didn\u2019t continue his research from earlier. Instead, he found a book and sat in the living room reading it. By the time he was halfway through, He Qi also filled half the coffee table with all kinds of snacks. The person who said she was coming had yet to show up.Lou Ming looked at the time and found that it was almost ten o\u2019clock. It was already this time, that little girl shouldn\u2019t be coming today. Lou Ming estimated that the little girl was chatting with her family and forgot to come here. After all, this was her first return since the holiday. The Chen family hasn\u2019t seen their daughter for a long time.Suddenly, a faint loss emerged. Lou Ming shook his head with a wry smile. As expected, he hasn\u2019t had normal social interactions in a long time, so he cared a lot. Lou Ming closed the book in his hand and planned to put it back in his study and return to his room to take a rest.\u201cThird Young Master.\u201d At this time, He Qi entered from outside and said with a complicated face, \u201cDid Miss Chen said that she made an appointment with you to come over tonight as a guest?\u201dIt turns out that the girl mentioned by Third Young Master was the Chen family\u2019s Miss ah, which almost made him think crookedly.1\u201d\u2026\u201d Lou Ming, who just thought someone wouldn\u2019t come, also had a complicated expression, \u201cLet her in.\u201dThe moment Chen Yu stepped into the courtyard, the rich spiritual energy went straight into her bones. This feeling made her comfortable and almost caused her to moan. The compass in Chen Yu\u2019s pocket also felt comfortable and shook twice in excitement.\u201cBe reserve.\u201d Chen Yu took out the compass, put it in her palm and tapped it. Then, she looked around the courtyard curiously. Last time she was in a hurry, so she didn\u2019t notice that there was a spirit gathering array in the courtyard.\u201dMiss Chen Yu, Third Young Master is waiting for you in the living room.\u201d He Qi reminded.Chen Yu \u2018oh\u2019, then ran in with a light face and looked up at Lou Ming\u2019s stern look.\u201dThird Brother, I\u2019m here.\u201d Chen Yu greeted vigorously. She glanced at the nearby coffee table filled with heaps of snacks and gulped uncontrollably. Chen Yu\u2019s two big eyes glimmered and face was full of expectation as she asked, \u201cWere these\u2026prepared for me?\u201dThis couldn\u2019t be blamed on her narcissism, because the way it was displayed was clearly for guests.\u201dEn.\u201d Lou Ming nodded.\u00a0This was originally prepared for her.\u201dThank you, Third Brother.\u201d Chen Yu cheered and jumped onto the sofa to eat. Although she was rich now, she has always been a good frugal child and never been rotten.Lou Ming turned around with a complicated face. He waited for the little girl to take two bites before asking aloud: \u201cDoes Mayor Chen and Mrs. Chen know that you\u2019re here?\u201d\u201dThey don\u2019t know ah.\u201d Chen Yu replied as she ate. \u201cI waited until they fell asleep before sneaking out. Otherwise, they will know how bad I am when I run out at night.\u201d\u201cYou also know that it\u2019s not good to run out at night?\u201d Lou Ming raised an eyebrow.\u201dI know ah.\u201d Chen Yu knowingly replied.\u201d\u2026\u201d For the first time, the knowledgeable Third Young Master didn\u2019t know how to reply. She already knows that it\u2019s bad, what else should I say? Third Young Master Lou was dispirited.\u201dCan I watch TV?\u201d Chen Yu asked, turning her head over to him while eating chocolate biscuits.\u201dWatch.\u201d Lou Ming waited for Chen Yu to turn on the TV with the remote control before he asked, \u201cXi\u2026. Girl, when are you going to go back?\u201d\u00a0After all, it\u2019s already ten o\u2019clock in the evening.\u201cAh, you don\u2019t have to worry about me. I\u2019ll leave before dawn.\u201d Chen Yu said and adjusted her seating to be more comfortable. She took the remote control in one hand and grabbed a pillow with her other hand and held it in her arms, then muttered in a low voice, \u201cThis pillow is so hard ah.\u201dDawn?\u00a0Lou Ming\u2019s face was a little dark. He looked at the compass that Chen Yu placed at the corner of the table and said, \u201cYou can leave the compass here and come back tomorrow to get it. You don\u2019t have to stay here all night.\u201d\u201cBut I also want to absorb spiritual energy ah.\u201d Chen Yu said pitifully, \u201cI lost a lot of spiritual energy catching the malevolent ghost on the mountain that day. I still haven\u2019t recovered yet.\u201dLou Ming\u2019s eyes glanced at the little girl\u2019s right arm when recalling the events from that day. He saw that the wound was scabbed and was almost recovered. He put down his heart and said, \u201cYou can come back tomorrow during the day.\u201d\u201cOkay. I sneak into your home anyway. What\u2019s the difference between day and night?\u201d Chen Yu continued, \u201cAnd I have to find an excuse to go out during the day otherwise my mom will definitely ask.\u201dWhat\u2019s the difference between day and night? Sneak into your home anyway.\u00a0Blue tendons on Lou Ming\u2019s forehead bulged at the ambiguous words.\u201dNo,\u201d Lou Ming frowned. \u201cWhen it\u2019s twelve, you must go back.\u201dChen Yu saw that Lou Ming looked a little angry. Although she didn\u2019t understand why, she could only honestly nod.Lou Ming\u2019s complexion cleared up a little. He was about to educate this little girl on the dangers of staying alone in a place filled with men when the cellphone on the couch suddenly rang.Chen Yu saw this, grabbed his cellphone and handed it to Lou Ming.Lou Ming took the phone and found it was a video call from his mom. Lou Ming turned to Chen Yu and said, \u201cYou watch TV here. I\u2019ll go and take this call.\u201dAfter that, Lou Ming took his cellphone to the study on the second floor and accepted the video call.Mother Lou is an elegant elderly lady that was nearly sixty years old. She had a light smile on her elegant delicate face: \u201cWhy did it took you so long to answer the phone? Were you enthralled by some drawings again?\u201dLou Ming smiled and agreed tacitly. He strangely asked, \u201cMom, why are you still awake so late?\u201dMother Lou pays great attention to personal maintenance after she aged. She usually goes to bed before ten o\u2019clock.\u201dOf course, there\u2019s a reason.\u201d After Mother Lou finished, the video on the cellphone suddenly moved. It seemed that Mother Lou was handing her cellphone to another person.\u201dYoungest Uncle!\u201d A clear and loud child\u2019s voice suddenly came from the other end of the phone. The four or five-year-old boy suddenly appeared on the video call.\u201dCongcong?\u201d Lou Ming looked surprised.\u201cUncle, I came to see grandpa and grandma today but why aren\u2019t you home?\u201d Congcong\u2019s little face crinkled and complained, \u201cI\u2019m so big now and still haven\u2019t met my uncle yet. When will you come see me?\u201dCongcong is the son of Lou Ming\u2019s elder sister, Lou Jingxin. Lou Ming\u2019s brother-in-law is a diplomat and his family are stationed abroad all year round. Lou Jingxin brings her children home to visit her relatives several times a year but for many years, Lou Ming has never seen his nephew Congcong. After all, that child\u2019s spirituality was too weak. Lou Ming was afraid that his evil spirits will hurt the child, so he only saw Congcong through video chat over these years. But the strange thing was, he likes his Third Uncle in the Lou family, Lou Ming, the most.\u201cDon\u2019t give your uncle trouble.\u201d Lou Jingxin took the cellphone from Congcong\u2019s hand and said, \u201cLou Ming, we won\u2019t disturb you. Have a good rest.\u201d\u201dNo.\u201d\u201cAs soon as we got home from the airport, Congcong asked to see you. He said he wanted to give you a gift he personally prepared. I didn\u2019t even know that he prepared a gift for you.\u201d Lou Jingxin said with a smile.\u201dReally?\u201d Lou Ming was also curious.\u201dUncle.\u201d Congcong rubbed against his mother. \u201cI brought you a gift. Come here tomorrow and I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201dBefore Lou Ming could speak, he heard his elder sister say to her son: \u201cCongcong, your uncle is busy with his work. Give the gift to mom so I can help give it to him.\u201d\u201cNo, no. Uncle please come back and see me.\u201d Congcong\u2019s face was full of anticipation. \u201cI seem to have a cold today. Can you come over to see me tomorrow?\u201d\u201cIf you have a cold, go to bed early.\u201d Lou Jingxin picked up the cellphone and said to Lou Ming, \u201cWe won\u2019t disturb you anymore. I\u2019ll take Congcong to bed first. I think the air conditioner on the plane was too cold.\u201d\u201dOkay.\u201dLou Ming stared attentively at the dark cellphone screen. An image of his family\u2019s faces flashed before his eyes. Congcong\u2019s pitiful voice wanting him to go home.\u00a0It seems that I haven\u2019t had a meal with my family in more than ten years and never met any of the younger generations of my family.As early as a few years ago, his mother and elder sister was always regretful that he couldn\u2019t be present for family gatherings. The whole family wasn\u2019t really united, but after a long time, everyone gradually got used to it. Last year when Lou Ming called on New Year\u2019s Day to pay respect, they already had New Year\u2019s Eve family dinner.Lou Ming wasn\u2019t angry, but he was a little sad. After a long time, he gradually got used to the loneliness but became more homesick. What\u2019s more, his home was only a twenty-minute drive from here.\u201dHahaha\u2026\u201d There was a sudden burst of laughter downstairs which almost caused the patrolling soldiers in the courtyard to rush in with their guns. Fortunately, they were stopped by He Qi who explained that Miss Chen was watching a variety show.Lou Ming returned to his senses and put down his cellphone. He walked out of the study and stand at the corridor on the second floor. He looked at the smiling girl in the living room and his eyes suddenly lit up.He turned to go downstairs, walked to Chen Yu\u2019s side and uttered: \u201cGirl, I want to ask you for a favor.\u201dChen Yu, who couldn\u2019t stop laughing at the variety show, finally managed to stop laughing and casually asked, \u201cHurry, what.\u201d\u201cCan you give me another calming spirit talisman?\u201d Lou Ming remembered that Chen Yu had said the calming spirit talisman can last for two hours. Deducing the 40-minute round trip, he could stay at home for an hour and twenty minutes.\u201cAll right ah. When do you want it?\u201d Although it took a lot of effort to draw the talisman, she can now come to this place at any time to absorb spiritual energy. If she stayed here, she could recover after an hour.\u201dTomorrow morning.\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s voice was faintly excited.So, the next morning, Chen Yu used the excuse of shopping with her classmates to go out. Mother Chen\u2019s face expressed: my family\u2019s daughter finally made friends. But Chen Yu actually left the house, turned and slipped into the Lou family\u2019s courtyard.Author\u2019s Notes:Humph, the easiest solution is to cut her off, hahahaha\u20262Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Believe It Or Not, I Already Caught YouCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCaught a PervertTen minutes after Chen Yu entered the Lou family\u2019s courtyard, a low-key black car drove out of the small courtyard for the first time during the day and drove on the crowded road.Before leaving, Lou Ming called his mom, but the call wouldn\u2019t connect. Lou Ming had to send a message to his mom\u2019s cellphone saying that he will be there later. In fact, he actually wanted to suddenly appear outside his house and surprise his family. But considering his condition, Lou Ming gave up on this idea.There was a burst of coolness from the calming spirit talisman from his palm. Lou Ming subconsciously opened his hand and stared blankly at the bustling crowd outside the window for two seconds.There was a price to be paid to do anything in this world. The calming spirit talisman hurts his body but only this thing can let him go out like an ordinary person. He could go home and eat together with his family like an ordinary person. Lou Ming wasn\u2019t afraid to pay the price. What he feared was that no matter what price he was willing to pay, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get what he wants.Twenty minutes passed quickly, and the car stopped at the door of a Chinese-style courtyard. Lou Ming stood excitedly at the door but didn\u2019t knock. He took out his cellphone and looked at it. He found that his mom didn\u2019t reply back to his WeChat message. That chat box was still idle, waiting for the message he sent 20 minutes ago to be seen:(Mom, I\u2019ll be home in 20 minutes. I have a calming spirit talisman so that the evil spirits won\u2019t leak. But I can only stay at home for an hour. Don\u2019t tell Congcong, I want to surprise him.)Lou Ming hesitated, then called Mother Lou again but the call still didn\u2019t connect. Lou Ming then opened his sister Lou Jingxin\u2019s WeChat and video called her. Lou Jingxin just returned to China, so her phone wasn\u2019t able to receive calls. Thus, Lou Ming chose to do a WeChat video call. The video call connected after a while.\u201dLou Ming, why did you call me so early?\u201d Lou Jingxin held her son Congcong who was playing in the garden.\u201dUncle, uncle.\u201d Congcong heard his uncle\u2019s voice and loudly called out through the phone screen. It was so loud that he could hear it behind the courtyard door.Lou Ming said with a gentle smile: \u201cSister, I\u2019m outside the door.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re outside the door?\u201d Lou Jingxin was momentarily dumbfounded.\u00a0Wasn\u2019t Lou Ming unable to leave the small courtyard casually?\u201cIs uncle outside the door? I\u2019ll go and open the door for you.\u201d Congcong finished his words, slipped out of Lou Jingxin\u2019s arms and ran all the way to the courtyard door.\u201cCongcong, Congcong, wait\u2026\u201d Lou Jingxin was anxious and couldn\u2019t talk to Lou Ming. As soon as she released the phone, she ran after Congcong. Unfortunately, she was wearing high heels. It wasn\u2019t easy to walk on the grass so she couldn\u2019t catch up to her son who was like a bullet. She could only watch Congcong run to the gate, stretch out his hand to open the gate and rush out with excitement.Lou Ming crouched down and hugged the little guy running towards him.\u201dUncle, uncle, are you here to see me?\u201d Congcong\u2019s big round eyes were full of joy.\u201dYes ah.\u201d Lou Ming nodded with a smile.At this time, Lou Jingxin also caught up and was at the door. When she saw her son in Lou Ming\u2019s arms, her face suddenly changed. Almost instinctively, she rushed over to pull Congcong out of Lou Ming\u2019s arms, turned around and ran back to the yard. She stopped once there was three meters between them.The smile on Lou Ming\u2019s face stiffened and his hand remained in the position of hugging Congcong. Lou Ming\u2019s eyes were full of astonishment as he looked at his elder sister.\u201dMommy, what are you doing?\u201d Congcong was confused and looked up at his mommy who suddenly took him.\u201dI\u2026\u201d Lou Jingxin looked down at her son, then looked up at Lou Ming who was standing outside the door. She suddenly realized that she might have done something wrong.At this time, Lou Ming adjusted his mood. He had a gentle smile again and stood up calmly. However, he didn\u2019t take a step forward even if the door was opened in front of him.\u201cMommy is playing with you.\u201d Lou Ming smiled and made an excuse for Lou Jingxin.\u201dBut I prefer to play with my uncle.\u201d Congcong said in a childlike manner.Lou Jingxin\u2019s lips opened and closed twice. She looked at her younger brother Lou Ming. Her face turned red and white for a while, now knowing what to do.At this time, they heard Mother Lou come out of the living room and doubtfully asked, \u201cLinxi, what are you doing? What\u2019s wrong with Congcong?\u201d\u201dMom.\u201d Lou Jingxin looked at her mother for help.\u201dMom.\u201d Lou Ming called out and smiled. He saw his mother who he hasn\u2019t seen for a long time.Mother Lou suddenly heard Lou Ming\u2019s voice. She turned her head in disbelief. When she saw her youngest son, her face was surprised. She was about to walk over with trembling steps: \u201cLou Ming, why are you here?\u201d\u201dMom!\u201d Lou Jingxin raised her hand and pulled her mother\u2019s arm.\u201dWhat are you doing?\u201d Mother Lou was confused and looked at her daughter.\u201cHaven\u2019t you been feeling unwell recently?\u201d Lou Jingxin reminded. Then turned to look carefully at Lou Ming outside as if explaining something.Mother Lou\u2019s expression was dumbfounded and took back the steps she taken.Lou Ming\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. He still had a gentle and warm smile: \u201cElder sister is right. Mom, your body isn\u2019t very good. Don\u2019t get too close to me.\u201d\u201dBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI was just passing by and thought about what Congcong said yesterday about preparing a gift for me. So, I was curious.\u201d Lou Ming looked at Congcong with a smile and said, \u201cUncle will leave soon. Can Congcong give me the gift?\u201d\u201cUncle will leave soon? Then I\u2019ll go get the gift.\u201d Congcong nodded, then pulled his arm that was held by his mommy. He wanted to go back into the house to get the gift. \u201cMommy, you let go of me. I\u2019m going to get the gift for my uncle.\u201d\u201dAh? Oh.\u201d Lou Jingxin released her hand and let her son walk back into the house.\u201dLou Ming, sister\u2026just now\u2026\u201d Lou Jingxin tried to explain something, but after she opened her mouth, she didn\u2019t know how to explain herself and stammered for a while.\u201dI understand.\u201d Lou Ming comforted with a smile, \u201cMom and Congcong aren\u2019t in good health. They shouldn\u2019t get too close to me. Sister you did the right thing.\u201d\u201dBut\u2026but I\u2026\u201d The more Lou Ming said, the guiltier Lou Jingxin was. Although her younger brother\u2019s physique was special, this wasn\u2019t what he wanted. Although she was disappointed with herself, but with her son\u2019s physical condition, Lou Jingxin had no choice but to do this.\u201cIt\u2019s my own fault. I was so happy to see Congcong and didn\u2019t pay attention to distance myself.\u201d Lou Ming \u2018scolded himself\u2019, and continued, \u201cIf something happens to Congcong, I will regret it. So, elder sister you\u2019re right. I have to thank you.\u201dMother Lou listened to their conversation and understood something. She couldn\u2019t say her daughter did something wrong, but she thought it was unfair for Lou Ming. Lou Ming hasn\u2019t taken the initiative to visit them in more than a decade. Suddenly, he came today. It can be seen that he really misses them, but he just\u2026\u201dMom, you\u2019ve been unwell recently?\u201d Lou Ming saw that the atmosphere was a little heavy and deliberately changed the subject.\u201cMom is okay. It\u2019s because I had a heat stroke two days ago and my appetite hasn\u2019t been good recently.\u201d Mother Lou couldn\u2019t bear for her son to worry about her, so she tried to make it sound unimportant.\u201dWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that you had a heat stroke?\u201d Lou Ming frowned.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. It only affected my appetite, there\u2019s no other problems at all.\u201d Mother Lou quickly said.\u201dEven if you have no appetite, you should eat more.\u201d Lou Ming hid his heart and said with concern.Lou Ming has always known when someone in his family is sick. If they are slightly ill, they will call and tell him. But if they are seriously ill, then they will never tell him. In fact, it\u2019s useless to tell him, he can\u2019t even visit them in the hospital. What can he do except worry?\u201dOkay, Mom knows.\u201d Mother Lou responded with a smile.The atmosphere finally eased a lot. At this time, Congcong ran out of the room with the gift, trotting all the way to the door. When Lou Jingxin was hesitating to stop her son again, Lou Ming suddenly stopped Congcong from running any further.\u201cCongcong, please don\u2019t come here first.\u201dThe child Congcong held the gift and looked up at his uncle in confusion.\u201cIs this the gift you personally prepared for me?\u201d Lou Ming asked with a smile.\u201dI made it myself.\u201d Congcong said proudly.\u201cYou made it yourself?\u201d Lou Ming saw Congcong nodded his head fiercely and said with a smile, \u201cBut uncle doesn\u2019t believe it. Congcong is so small, how can he make a gift?\u201d\u201dReally, I made it myself.\u201d Congcong explained anxiously.\u201cUncle wants to test you.\u201d Lou Ming said while the child looked at him with anticipation, \u201cSince you made the gift yourself, then you must know what\u2019s inside.\u201dCongcong nodded.\u201cThen give the gift to mommy, and let mommy give it to uncle. Uncle will unwrap the gift and ask you some questions about the gift to see if you can guess what it is.\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cHumph, I\u2019m not afraid. Ask me. You will know that I made the gift with my own hands after asking.\u201d Congcong was a little unhappy and handed the gift in his hand to his mom beside him.When Lou Jingxin received the gift, she was momentarily dumbfounded. After being urged twice by Congcong, she gave the gift to Lou Ming with a complicated face.When Lou Ming received the gift, he smiled at his sister gently as usual. Then bowed his head and began to open the gift.\u201dLet uncle see what\u2019s inside\u2026\u201d Lou Ming deliberately said loudly as he opened.Congcong looked nervous and waited for his uncle to open the gift. When he was sure that he saw what was inside, he loudly said: \u201cThere\u2019s a jigsaw inside. I took my photo and uncle\u2019s photo and asked someone to make it.\u201dLou Ming looked at the group photo of himself and Congcong on the jigsaw puzzle. The two heads, one big and one small, leaned close together. At first glance, their heads were screenshots from the video calls. Lou Ming\u2019s heart became warm, his mouth hooked up and said to Congcong, \u201cThank you. Uncle likes it very much.\u201d\u201cHehe\u2026uncle what are you doing, if you have any questions, please ask. I\u2019m sure I can answer them correctly.\u201d Congcong said with a smile.\u201cSo sure ah. Uncle will ask a difficult one then. How many puzzle pieces are there?\u201d Lou Ming decided that no matter how many pieces Congcong said, he will nod and say it was right.\u201dOne hundred and eight pieces.\u201d Congcong replied without thinking.Lou Ming\u2019s mathematics is very good. He glanced at the grid on the jigsaw puzzle casually and knew that Congcong\u2019s answer was right: \u201cThe answer is correct. It seems that Congcong really did make it for uncle himself.\u201d\u201dOf course.\u201d Congcong finally proved himself and his expression showed he was proud of himself.\u201cI received the gift. Uncle is busy, I will come see you next time.\u201d Lou Ming said suddenly.\u201dAh, uncle, you leave as soon as you come ah.\u201d Congcong was anxious and wanted to run over. But as soon as he moved, his arm was caught by Lou Jingxin again. He turned to look at his mommy in confusion, \u201cMommy\u2026\u201d\u201dMom, elder sister, I\u2019ll go first.\u201d Lou Ming said goodbye to Mother Lou and Lou Jingxin, then turned to walk to the car on the side.When Lou Ming turned to open the door, Congcong\u2019s pitiful voice came from behind: \u201cUncle didn\u2019t even come in, how can he leave?\u201dLou Ming\u2019s movement to open the door paused, but soon returned to normal. He sat in the car.Tian Fei was quietly sitting in the car waiting for Third Young Master. When he started the car, he asked, \u201cThird Young Master, where do you want to go next?\u201d\u201cGo back.\u201d Apart from here, he has no other special place he wanted to go to.At this time in the Lou family\u2019s garden, Mother Lou\u2019s eyes were red from her grandson\u2019s words.Tian Fei carefully looked at the desolate Third Young Master from the rearview mirror. Although Tian Fei didn\u2019t get out of the car, he listened to what happened at the Lou family\u2019s gate. Although he can understand Lou Jingxin\u2019s actions, he felt more distressed for Third Young Master.\u201cThird Young Master, why didn\u2019t you explain to your family that the talisman on your body won\u2019t let the evil spirits leak out?\u201d Tian Fei couldn\u2019t help but ask.After hearing Tian Fei\u2019s words, Lou Ming suddenly remembered something. He took out his cellphone, opened his mom\u2019s chat box and sent a message to her again: (Mom, don\u2019t tell sister about the calming spirit talisman. I will come back to see you some other day.)\u201dAt that time, it was no longer convenient to say.\u201d After his elder sister\u2019s reaction, Lou Ming definitely could not say that he had a calming spirit talisman. If she was told it prevented the evil spirits from leaking out and Congcong won\u2019t be hurt, then his elder sister will definitely be very awkward and embarrassed.For example\u2026 if a person with AIDS suddenly ran up and told you that his disease was cured and is non-contagious, will you immediately stay with him without any worries? You will definitely still hesitate.Lou Ming didn\u2019t think about the issue that he should have trusted the other person more since they were his family. He wasn\u2019t willing to test human nature.Finally, the sentimental mood was erased. Mother Lou returned to the house and took her charging cellphone to call her husband to tell him about Lou Ming\u2019s return. However, she suddenly opened the message that Lou Ming sent her half an hour ago. She looked at the two messages in succession and Mother Lou could no longer restrain herself anymore and cried with her mouth covered.=1When Lou Ming return home, Chen Yu was still sitting on the sofa in the living room watching TV. Chen Yu was surprised when she saw Lou Ming return and asked, \u201cHow come you came back so soon?\u201d\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d Lou Ming asked instead.\u201cI\u2019m restoring my spiritual energy ah.\u201d Chen Yu reminded, \u201cYou forgot that I just helped you draw a calming spirit talisman just now.\u201d\u201dDoes it use a lot of spiritual energy to draw a calming spirit talisman?\u201d Lou Ming was astonished.\u201cYes, it will take me an hour of staying here to restore it.\u201d Chen Yu completely forgot that just recently, she shamelessly said that the calming spirit talisman was the simplest.\u201dThat\u2019s right ah.\u201d Lou Ming wasn\u2019t in a good mood and didn\u2019t plan to talk to the little girl anymore. He glanced at the empty coffee table in front of Chen Yu and said to Tian Fei behind him, \u201cGo get some food.\u201dLou Ming finished giving out orders and went upstairs with the gift he received.After a while, Tian Fei brought a bunch of snacks to Chen Yu. Chen Yu thanked him happily. She comfortably nestled on the sofa with some potato chips. This person didn\u2019t want to move when she was comfortable, so time quickly flew by.Lou Ming stayed upstairs for two hours. When he went downstairs, he saw the little girl was still watching TV on the sofa and asked, \u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d\u201dWatching TV ah. This series is so funny.\u201d Chen Yu pointed to the TV.Lou Ming glanced at the TV and saw that the female lead on TV was lying in a man\u2019s arms with tears streaming down her face, shouting, \u201cOppa, oppa don\u2019t die ah.\u201d2\u00a0She cried from being heartbroken. Then Lou Ming had a subtle expression when he turned to Chen Yu who was still laughing.\u201dHahahaha, so funny.\u201d Chen Yu laughed again.\u201dIs it that funny?\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help asking.\u201cLet me tell you that there was actually a female ghost on TV. Just now that female ghost was jealous and pushed the female lead away. She laid on the male lead first and tried her best to kiss him. Having your tofu eaten by a ghost, hahaha, this female ghost must have been a fan of this oppa before she died.\u201d Chen Yu pointed to the TV and laughed again, \u201cThat female ghost is trying to take off that oppa\u2019s clothes, but she can\u2019t take it off. She\u2019s so stupid. How can a ghost who just died with no power have the ability to touch an entity?\u201d\u201d\u2026\u201d Lou Ming looked at the show that only had one man and one woman on TV, then suddenly was a little creeped out, \u201cYou\u2026can see ghosts on TV?\u201d\u201cYes, but this TV series is foreign. I can\u2019t understand what the female ghost is saying. If it was a domestic series, I will be able to understand what the female ghost is saying. It\u2019s funny, hahaha\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t know what Chen Yu saw to cause her to laugh again.Lou Ming has met many Heavenly Masters because of his physique. However, Chen Yu was the first to actually see him.3At this time, Tian Fei entered. He looked at Third Young Master and asked, \u201cThird Young Master, what would you like for your meal?\u201dLou Ming turned to look at Chen Yu and asked, \u201cGirl, do you want to eat a meal here or at home?\u201d\u201cI told my mom that I went out shopping with my classmates today, how can I go home to eat?\u201d Mentioning Mother Chen, Chen Yu suddenly remembered something and jumped up from the sofa. She panicked and said, \u201cI almost forgot. My mom gave me five thousand yuan to spend on clothes today.\u201d\u201cThen you can go out and buy it after lunch.\u201d Lou Ming asked, \u201cWhat would you like to eat for lunch?\u201d\u201dI\u2019m not picky.\u201d Chen Yu was easy to raise since she was a child.\u201dThen let\u2019s eat Sichuan food.\u201d Lou Ming remembered that the dishes from Qingmu Province were spicy.\u201dYes, I\u2019ll have someone buy it.\u201d Because of Lou Ming\u2019s physique, the Lou family\u2019s courtyard naturally wasn\u2019t equipped with a maid or cook. Most of the time, the bodyguards will ask Lou Ming what he wanted to eat and send someone to buy it.\u201dYou still have to go out and buy it, ah? Then the food that\u2019s bought won\u2019t taste delicious.\u201d Chen Yu turned around and said, \u201cIt\u2019s better to go out and eat.\u201d\u201d\u2026\u201d Lou Ming was stunned. Before he could refuse, he heard Chen Yu continue.\u201cAnyway, I still need to go out to buy clothes later. It\u2019s better for us to drive to a nearby mall to eat, then pick out clothes for us casually.\u201d Chen Yu immediately thought the idea was very good. \u201cLet\u2019s do it. Kill two birds with one stone.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have someone take you.\u201d Lou Ming still planned to not go.\u201cAre you worried about your evil spirits. Oh, don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s me.\u201d Chen Yu then got off the sofa and reached out to grasp Lou Ming\u2019s palm. Her fingers slid rapidly across Lou Ming\u2019s broad palm and soon a calming spirit talisman was drawn.Feeling the familiar coolness on his palm, Lou Ming looked at Chen Yu in shock.\u201cYou see, it\u2019s okay. Two hours is enough time to eat hot pot.\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s face showed she was proud of her achievement.\u201cThis calming spirit talisman not only suppress the evil spirts but can also harm the body that carries the calming spirit talisman.\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s mind flashed back to Master Mao\u2019s analysis of the calming spirit talisman. But looking at Chen Yu\u2019s clear eyes, Lou Ming couldn\u2019t imagine that little girl would harm him. Maybe, this little girl doesn\u2019t know that the talisman affects him.\u201cHow is it? We better go eat hot pot. We can order the mandarin duck pot, so we can have spicy and non-spicy dishes.\u201d Chen Yu suddenly wanted to eat hot pot, but wasn\u2019t interested in going alone and vigorously persuaded Lou Ming, \u201cThird Brother, let\u2019s go, go.\u201d\u201cNow that you drew your calming spirit talisman, I\u2019ll see if I can go.\u201d Lou Ming gently smiled, \u201cIf I don\u2019t go, wouldn\u2019t it be a waste of a talisman?\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Chen Yu nodded repeatedly, \u201cYou certainly haven\u2019t been out for a long time, this will be a great opportunity.\u201d\u201dYou\u2019re right, let\u2019s go.\u201d Lou Ming gently smiled. This little girl is right. He hasn\u2019t gone out to eat in a long time. He couldn\u2019t help but feel a little moved.=The hot pot restaurant in the shopping mall was about 20 minutes away from the military compound. Lou Ming and Chen Yu took a table along with Tian Fei and two other strong bodyguards responsible for Lou Ming\u2019s safety.The bottom of the pot constantly rolled, and steam rose. It caused Chen Yu\u2019s face to become red, but she kept using her chopsticks.Lou Ming didn\u2019t eat much. When he saw that Chen Yu\u2019s bowl was empty, he picked up the sour plum soup and filled up her bowl.\u201dThank you, Third Brother.\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s cheeks were stuffed to the brim, she took the time to thank him.Lou Ming saw Chen Yu\u2019s mouth was stained with sesame paste mixed with red oil making her look really untidy. He looked at the people around him and couldn\u2019t help taking out some napkins and handing them to Chen Yu. \u201cEat slowly, no one will rob you. Wipe your mouth first.\u201d\u201cWipe what mouth, it will get dirty from eating again in a while.\u201d Chen Yu said indifferently.\u201d\u2026\u201d Lou Ming frowned and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a girl. You can\u2019t be inelegant while you eat.\u201d It was the same the last time in the villa but at that time, there was no one around so Lou Ming didn\u2019t mind it.\u201cIf the food is eaten elegantly, then it must mean it\u2019s not delicious. If it was delicious, who has the time to pay attention to their etiquette.\u201d Chen Yu replied indifferently.\u201dDon\u2019t move.\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t refute the little girl\u2019s fallacious reasoning. But he couldn\u2019t bear to see Chen Yu like this. So, he forcibly interrupted Chen Yu from eating and stretched his arm across the table to help her clean the sesame oil paste from her mouth.\u201dOkay, keep eating.\u201d Lou Ming was finally comfortable.\u201dIt\u2019s troublesome for you to eat something.\u201d Chen Yu mumbled and continued to bury her head to eat.Lou Ming indulged her and smiled helplessly. He thought Chen Yu was really a child, but his mood was inexplicably better.Lou Ming\u2019s previous actions just now was very natural. He surprised the three strong men who has been with him for several years. They looked at each other. Tian Fei immediately took out his cellphone and sent a message to the WeChat group that composed of the seven assistants: (When seeing Miss Chen Yu, we all need to be polite. The Third Young Master likes her.)(Is Third Young Master in love?) An assistant grabbed this key point.(What? Third Young Master likes the Chen family\u2019s girl? I just left a day ago. How did this happen?) This was the assistant that rotated shifts with He Qi last night.(Third Young Master likes the Chen family\u2019s girl? What\u2019s there to even like about her?) This was Cheng Peng, who had a bad impression of Chen Yu.(What? Third Young Master is in love? I thought Third Young Master will be a bachelor for life.)(I think if Minister Lou finds out, he will definitely go to Mayor Chen\u2019s family home to propose marriage. Although there\u2019s an age difference, Miss Chen Yu is the only woman who isn\u2019t afraid of the Third Young Master\u2019s evil spirts.)(Inexplicably feels suitable.)(Inexplicably feels suitable.)(Inexplicably feels suitable.)\u2026\u2026Tian Fei saw that the group chat topic skewed and quickly explained: (I mean that Third Young Master likes Miss Chen Yu more than what we thought. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that kind of like.)An ellipsis flashed in the group.When Chen Yu was finally full, Lou Ming handed over the napkin he already prepared. Chen Yu took the napkin, wiped her mouth, and said, \u201cActually, I\u2019m very elegant when I eat at home.\u201d\u201cWhy are you elegant when you eat at home? Are you sure it\u2019s not like this outside\u2026inelegantly, usually isn\u2019t it the other way around?\u201d Lou Ming asked curiously.\u201cBecause of my parents ah.\u201d Chen Yu explained, \u201cIf I eat too fast at home, they will overthink it. They will think that I had a very bitter experience when I was in Damu Village before. Like I haven\u2019t eaten anything good or starved.\u201d\u201cMy mom will cry to the point that she can\u2019t move. I\u2019m afraid when she cries.\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but shiver at the thought of her mother\u2019s tears, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible when a woman cry.\u201dLou Ming looked at the little girl\u2019s expression that looked ridiculous and he couldn\u2019t help but smile again.\u201dWhat are you smiling about?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cSorry, I just think that you were very happy before.\u201d Cheerful and optimistic, carefree and simpleminded. This type of person can only be created by a healthy and beautiful environment.\u201dHehehe\u2026 alright la.\u201d Chen Yu casually asked, \u201cWhat about you? Were you happy?\u201dLou Ming didn\u2019t expect Chen Yu to ask this question and stared blankly at her. After a moment, Lou Ming used the same tone Chen Yu just used and replied: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad la.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so deceitful. You have such a special physique so you can\u2019t go out casually and I don\u2019t think you have any friends.\u201d Chen Yu said and generously patted her chest, \u201cBut now you don\u2019t have to worry about that. For the sake of inviting me out to eat hot pot, if you want to go out, you can come and ask me anytime. I\u2019ll draw a calming spirit talisman for you.\u201d\u201dIt seems that hot pot was worth it for me.\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but gently smile again.Tian Fei saw Third Young Master smile again and continued to bury himself into WeChat: (Brothers, Third Young Master has never stopped smiling during this meal ah. This time alone is more than the number of smiles he had last year. Now, his expression is completely different from when he returned from Minister Lou\u2019s house.)(So\u2026)(So\u2026)(So\u2026)(Add another work task to purchase all kinds of snacks. The Chen family\u2019s little girl is easily cheated by snacks.) He Qi saw Chen Yu\u2019s table manners last night.(Understood!)(Understood!)(For Third Young Master.) This was Cheng Peng who still had some prejudice against Chen Yu.These special soldiers who protect Lou Ming were those who survived in the battlefield utilizing the weapons that he designed. They clearly understand Lou Ming\u2019s value and sincerely admire him. However, such a person was isolated from society because of his condition. Even his family members, relatives and friends couldn\u2019t touch him, which made these rough big men feel sorry for Lou Ming.Although they didn\u2019t mind being affected by Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirits, he deliberately alienated himself from them. Even if they stay in the same yard all day long, they can\u2019t say a few words to him unless it was regarding work.Chen Yu was the only person who Lou Ming could touch without being affected by the evil spirits. Because of this, as long as Chen Yu didn\u2019t threaten Lou Ming\u2019s safety, these big rough men also decided to secretly please her. Not only snacks, if she wanted to eat a tiger, they can also contact their brothers at the border to see if they can get some from the jungle.After lunch, Chen Yu took Lou Ming to the women\u2019s clothing store downstairs. Lou Ming had never bought clothes with others and stood uncomfortably at the door. The scene was even more eye-catching since he was accompanied by three burly men.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go in. I\u2019ll go and grab some items.\u201d Chen Yu also noticed that Lou Ming was uncomfortable and suggested this.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Take your time. We\u2019ll wait for you at the door.\u201d There was still 50 minutes left being the calming spirit talisman\u2019s effects faded. It really wasn\u2019t necessary to worry too much.Chen Yu nodded, turned around and entered the women\u2019s clothing store. As she stepped into the store, a familiar coolness overcame Chen Yu, causing her footsteps to pause.\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lou Ming asked when he noticed Chen Yu\u2019s unusual appearance.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Chen Yu smiled and shook her head, then continued to step into the store.There were many ghosts in this big city. You can meet them anywhere.\u00a0Anyway, my yin yang eyes aren\u2019t open.What the eyes doesn\u2019t see, the heart doesn\u2019t grieve over. But this ghost was very annoying.Chen Yu raised her hand and picked up a black dress. She heard a strange voice from the side: \u201cTsk tsk, it\u2019s so black. It\u2019s not good to wear a black dress. Not afraid of going out at night and scaring others.\u201dChen Yu\u2019s hand that held the dress stiffened. She hung the black dress back on the rack and took a white dress beside her instead. As a result, the voice next to her continued to nag: \u201cMy God ah, you took the white one. White and black, are you cold medicine ah.\u201d4\u201d\u2026\u201d Chen Yu resisted the urge to beat up people. She put away the white dress in her hand and turned to the other side to pick up a pink dress. Then a coolness surrounded her and the ghost came again.\u201cTsk tsk. Foolishly na\u00efve, have such a pair of long legs but pick out such tasteless clothes.\u201d\u201dYou\u2026\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She turned around to scold the ghost but encountered the salesperson\u2019s friendly smile.\u201cLittle sister, you should try on the clothes beforehand to know whether they look good or not. Else, you won\u2019t be able to compare them well. Why don\u2019t you select some pieces and try them on in the fitting room?\u201d The salesperson saw Chen Yu pick up several unsuitable pieces of clothing and putting it down. So, she came over to give her a suggestion.\u201dAh, good.\u201d Chen Yu nodded, holding the pink dress in her hand and planned to go to the fitting room to try it on.As a result, the ghost didn\u2019t leave her alone. It followed Chen Yu all the way to the fitting room and clamored: \u201cWhy bother trying it, you\u2019ll just be uglier wearing nice clothes. It\u2019s not because the clothes look bad, rather it\u2019s being worn by unsuitable people. It really wastes the designer\u2019s efforts.\u201dChen Yu slammed the door of the fitting room with a \u2018clang\u2019 and separated herself from the ghost outside the door. She thought she got rid of the ghost, but this shameless ghost actually went into the fitting room. The angry Chen Yu threw the clothes in her hands. Opening her yin yang eyes, she raised her hand to grab the ghost\u2019s collar and pressed the spirit directly on the wall of the fitting room. She angrily said: \u201cYou say one more thing, believe it or not, I\u2019ll exterminate you.\u201d\u201dYou\u2026 can you see me?\u201d The male ghost looked at Chen Yu excitedly.\u201cNot only can I see you, but once you pissed me off enough, I\u2019ll exterminate you.\u201d Chen Yu fiercely threatened the flowery dressed male ghost.\u201dOh, my God ah, you\u2019re really a Heavenly Master. I say, your body had a layer of divine light.\u201d Obviously, the male ghost didn\u2019t pay attention to Chen Yu\u2019s threat.Instead, he immersed himself in the joy of discovering a Heavenly Master.\u201cJust know that you need to shut up and leave. If you dare peek at me while I\u2019m changing, I\u2026\u201d Chen Yu motioned with her hand crossing her neck.\u201cAi ya, I\u2019m so scared oh. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know anything. I also know some Heavenly Masters. You Heavenly Masters can\u2019t bully good ghosts like me who haven\u2019t done anything wrong, otherwise you\u2019ll sin.\u201d The male ghost said cheaply.\u201dI know quite a bit.\u201d Chen Yu sneered. \u201cYou\u2019re a living soul who doesn\u2019t want to go back to your body and hang around outside. Be careful that you really become a ghost.\u201dIf this guy was really a ghost, Chen Yu would have sent this kid back to the Underworld even if there were no profits. Unfortunately, this guy was a living soul. That\u2019s right, just when Chen Yu opened her yin yang eyes, she discovered that this guy wasn\u2019t dead at all, but his soul was detached from his body for some reason.\u201cYou know that I\u2019m not dead yet??\u201d The male ghost was shocked.\u201dDon\u2019t you know a lot? You don\u2019t even know that you\u2019re dead ah.\u201d Chen Yu was too lazy to talk nonsense with the other party. \u201cLeave. I\u2019m going to change my clothes. You\u2019re not allowed to come in and peek.\u201d\u201cWho wants to look at you, you\u2019re a little girl, what is there to see? Do you know how many world class models take off their clothes in front of me every day? They begged me to design clothes for them but I don\u2019t even spare them a glance.\u201d The male ghost proudly said, \u201cFor the sake of being able to see me, it\u2019s better that I help you pick out your clothes. You take off your clothes first and let me see your figure\u2026\u201dChen Yu angrily slapped the male ghost\u2019s face and dragged the semi-conscious ghost out of the fitting room.When the salesperson at the door saw Chen Yu coming out of the fitting room without trying the clothes, she couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWas the size of the clothes inappropriate?\u201d\u201dNo, wait ah.\u201d Chen Yu smiled at the salesperson, turned to the door and shouted, \u201cThird Brother, Third Brother.\u201dLou Ming heard Chen Yu\u2019s voice and came in the store. He then and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201dThird Brother, you come here.\u201d Chen Yu dragged the male ghost and took Lou Ming to the resting area in the store. Then she placed the male ghost\u2019s arm directly on Lou Ming\u2019s right hand.Lou Ming only felt that there was a cold mass on top of his hand, but when he looked down, he saw there was nothing on his hand. He suddenly looked up at Chen Yu with confusion.\u201cThere\u2019s a pervert trying to peek at me while I\u2019m changing.\u201d Chen Yu explained.Lou Ming\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously, and he looked in the direction of the fitting room.\u201cYou have my calming spirit talisman on your hand. If you hold his arm, he can\u2019t move. Let me try on these clothes first.\u201d Chen Yu said then turned back to head into the fitting room.Hold his arm, whose arm, the pervert?Lou Ming looked at his right hand strangely and his palm was empty. There was a cold touch but there was nothing around ah.It was one thing to know ghosts exists in this world. But he never thought there would be a day that he would hold hands with a ghost, nevertheless a perverted ghost.Third Young Master Lou, who has been feared by people, felt a chill on his spine for the first time.Author\u2019s Notes:Enter VIP.5\u00a0Thank you to the little angels for your continuous support.

    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Believe It Or Not, I Already Caught YouCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHolding HandsAlthough he was a little scared, the expression on Lou Ming\u2019s face was very calm. The palm of his right hand tightly held the ghost as his eyes continually stared in the direction of the fitting room.\u201cAre you the third brother of that little girl? Sure enough, men grow up to look more like their mothers while women grow up to look more like their fathers. You look much better than that girl.\u201d\u201dHey, hello, can you hear me?\u201d The male ghost shouted for a long time. But apart from holding him still, Lou Ming obviously had no reaction and couldn\u2019t see him. He became bored and stopped. He sat on the sofa to the right of Lou Ming and proceeded to looked at the direction of the fitting room.After a while, Chen Yu came out wearing that pink dress. She didn\u2019t go the mirror but instead jumped directly in front of Lou Ming and happily asked, \u201cDo I look good?\u201dLou Ming had never been asked this kind of question before. But the cute little girl naturally looks good in anything. He gently smiled and nodded: \u201cLooks good.\u201d\u201cLooks good? How does it look good? Her skin is so dark, but she wears pink. Doesn\u2019t she know how dark she is? And that dress, what kind of tomboy are you to pretend to have a good girl\u2019s temperament.\u201d The ghost, who couldn\u2019t move because of Lou Ming\u2019s hand, had spicy eyes looking at Chen Yu\u2019s attire.Chen Yu\u2019s grin was half-formed, but anxiously froze.The salesperson sister didn\u2019t find anything strange, came up and praised: \u201cLittle sister, you look really good in this dress. That pink dress is our best-seller this year oh. Moreover, it gives a nice contrast to your slightly dark skin tone with the pink color\u2019s white tone.\u201d\u201cBest seller means that while walking on the street, there will always be one out of ten people who will wear the same clothes. You\u2019ll be the ugliest one.\u201d\u201cPink has a white tone, so let\u2019s analyze it. If people wear white, it\u2019s because they\u2019re white. When you wear it, it will only look dark. These salespeople will spew nonsense with their eyes open just to sell clothes.\u201d At the salesperson\u2019s words, the male ghost roasted her maliciously.The blue tendons on the back of Chen Yu\u2019s hand jumped. The saleswoman who was excessively praising her was the last straw. She strode over to Lou Ming and punched and kicked the area on his right side.The male ghost cried out \u2018ai ai\u2019 but no one could hear him except Chen Yu.Seeing the salesperson puzzled, Lou Ming smiled and explained to her: \u201cShe likes this dress very much so she\u2019s very happy.\u201dThe salesperson saw Lou Ming\u2019s gentle smile, covered her chest and breathed out dizzily. She nodded faintly and looked straight at him in a daze. Why did it seem that Chen Yu\u2019s joyful expression was so wild?\u201dAre you uncomfortable?\u201d Lou Ming saw the saleswoman suddenly covered her chest with red ears and a red face. This looked like warning signs of a heart attack, so Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but ask anxiously.\u201dDude, she\u2019s admiring your beauty.\u201d The male ghost ridiculed. He just recovered from Chen Yu\u2019s attack and just saw this scene when he looked up.Chen Yu, who just finished beating him, backhanded him again.\u201dDid I say something wrong again?\u201d The male ghost said very innocently.Fortunately, the salesperson\u2019s professionalism was still present. She wasn\u2019t completely dazzled by the Third Young Master\u2019s beauty. She remembered to ask Chen Yu about the clothes: \u201cAre you satisfied with the clothes? Would you like to try on a few more?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll take this one.\u201d Chen Yu finished, then turned to walk to the fitting room, intending to change before purchasing it.\u201cYou really are buying it ah. I told you, you\u2019re not suitable for it, you\u2019re really dark.\u201d As a persistent designer, the male ghost couldn\u2019t tolerate his eyes being spicy.\u201dI\u2019m white!\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t bear it and roared before entering the fitting room.The slightly embarrassed Lou Ming and the stunned female salesperson looked at each other again. This time, he didn\u2019t know how to explain it, so he could only smile at her again.Ahhh\u2026 The male god smiled again, smiled again. Is he interested in me?\u201cLove-struck fool.\u201d The male ghost grumbled in dislike, but no one could hear him.After a while, Chen Yu changed into her original clothes. She went out of the fitting room and handed the pink dress to the salesperson to wrap up. Then, she went to the front desk with Lou Ming to check out.\u201dHow much is it?\u201d Chen Yu took out her cellphone, which contained the 5,000 yuan that Mother Chen transferred to her through WeChat.\u201dThis gentleman has already paid.\u201d The cashier looked at Lou Ming on the side with a smile.Chen Yu held her cellphone with confusion. Then she turned to Lou Ming and said, \u201cThird Brother?\u201dLou Ming was also very confused. He turned to look outside the shop. Assistant Tian from outside returned a formal military salute. Lou Ming instantly knew that he never brought his wallet when he went out. So, that means Tian Fei paid for it on his behalf.1\u201cThird Brother bought it for you.\u201d Lou Ming said with a smile.\u201dBut my mom gave me money to buy clothes.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cYou should keep it as pocket money to for going out to eat with your classmates.\u201d Lou Ming replied.\u201cStupid or not stupid, how can you go out shopping with a man and expect to pay for your own clothes\u2026\u201d The male ghost said halfway before he leaped and closed his mouth obediently when he saw Chen Yu\u2019s eyes warning him.Chen Yu just noticed that Third Brother still had his hand tightly holding onto the pervert\u2019s arm. This scene really\u2026 Chen Yu turned around and decisively separated one person and one ghost.Lou Ming looked up in surprise, as if to ask again,\u00a0didn\u2019t you want me to hold it?\u201cCome on Third Brother. Let\u2019s go back.\u201d Chen Yu took the shopping bag in one hand and held Lou Ming\u2019s hand in the other. She dragged the dazed Lou Ming and left the women\u2019s clothing store together.Chen Yu dragged Lou Ming all the way to the elevator exit. Tian Fei had already pressed the elevator button for them. While waiting for the elevator, Lou Ming, who was tightly held by Chen Yu withdrew his palm.Chen Yu noticed, but didn\u2019t care. She gave Lou Ming a sweet smile.Lou Ming\u2019s right hand still felt the sensation of Chen Yu\u2019s palm. He clenched his empty hand twice and loosened it quickly.Lou Ming, you can\u2019t be greedy for warmth just because this is the only person you can touch. After all, men and women are different. Although she\u2019s simpleminded, she\u2019s already a big girl.The male ghost on the side saw this scene and shook his head with a tsk tsk. Although they weren\u2019t siblings, but in this state, why did it look so interesting?\u201dDing\u201dAt this time, the elevator came. Fortunately, there was no one inside. Tian Fei blocked the elevator door with his hand to let Chen Yu and Lou Ming enter. The male ghost also took advantage of this gap and went in.\u201cGet out of here.\u201d Chen Yu fiercely roared when she saw this scene.Tian Fei, who had just stepped in with one foot, suddenly froze and stared blankly at Chen Yu.\u201dNot you.\u201d Third Young Master Lou explained thoughtfully.\u201d\u2026\u201d Then to who, Tian Fei blinked doubtfully.When the male ghost saw Chen Yu driving him out, he immediately said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of driving me out? I\u2019m a ghost now ah. I can pass through the wall, if you drive me out, I can still come in.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d If this person wasn\u2019t a living soul and was an ordinary ghost, Chen Yu would have exterminated him even if she was to receive karmic hindrance.\u201dOur meeting is predestined\u2026\u201dChen Yu lifted her hand and a faint divine light appeared.\u201dI want to ask you for help.\u201d When the male ghost saw Chen Yu\u2019s action, he immediately made his intentions clear. He had been floating outside for more than ten days and didn\u2019t know what happened to him. It wasn\u2019t easy to meet a Heavenly Master who was able to see him, how can he leave?\u201dNot helping!\u201d Chen Yu refused without thinking.Tian Fei and his two comrades-in-arms all looked at this scene strangely but didn\u2019t question this out loud.\u201dClose the door first.\u201d Lou Ming sighed softly. This little girl\u2019s skill wasn\u2019t small, but she wasn\u2019t cautious enough. Speaking to a ghost carelessly in public, isn\u2019t she afraid of being discovered?The elevator soon stopped on the first basement floor and Lou Ming got into the car first. Chen Yu was still quarrelling with the invisible pervert at the door of the car.\u201cYou help me out and send me back.\u201d The male ghost requested.\u201dSorry, you\u2019re not within the scope of my business.\u201d Chen Yu refused.\u201dAren\u2019t you a Heavenly Master? Why isn\u2019t it within your business scope.\u201d The male ghost asked, \u201cOr are you still blaming me for saying you were black? But I was telling the truth ah. That pink dress really isn\u2019t suitable for you. You, if you send me back, your clothes in the future\u2026\u201dIt can only be said that the male ghost was a very professionally persistent ghost.\u201dThere are many types of Heavenly Masters.\u201d Chen Yu really didn\u2019t want to listen to clothes anymore. She directly interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m an exorcist expert. Do you understand? There are only two things I can do for ghosts. One is sending them to Underworld, and the other is destroying your soul. So, do you want to go to the Underworld or have your soul scattered?Such ferocious words came out from Chen Yu\u2019s mouth. Lou Ming raised his eyebrows in surprise, but strangely didn\u2019t dislike it. On the contrary, he thought this little girl\u2019s serious and ferocious appearance was cute.\u201cThen you help me call my Second Uncle. He\u2019s also a Heavenly Master. Tell him that I\u2019m here.\u201d The male ghost saw that Chen Yu wasn\u2019t willing to help him regarding his own life and death. So, he could only retreat and ask for the next best request.\u201cCan.\u201d Chen Yu laughed evilly, \u201c100,000.\u201d\u201cIf you take 100,000 for one call, won\u2019t you be too dark?\u201d The male ghost exaggerated.\u201cHaven\u2019t you always said that I\u2019m black? Chen Yu was vengeful.\u201d\u2026\u201d The male ghost was speechless and choked silently.\u201dCough\u2026\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t restrain himself and almost laughed.\u201dSomeone is coming.\u201d A bodyguard reminded them from nearby.Lou Ming leaned out of the car and said to Chen Yu: \u201cLet\u2019s go first.\u201dChen Yu remembered the time limit for the calming spirit talisman on Lou Ming is expiring. So, she obediently lowered her head and got into the car. The moment the door closed, the male ghost quickly rushed in: \u201cI agree, 100,000, 100,000.\u201dLou Ming saw Chen Yu looking in a certain direction, then glanced at the seat on the left that was empty. He speculated that the pervert followed him and narrowed his eyes involuntarily.Chen Yu took out her cellphone and asked: \u201cPhone number.\u201dThe male ghost replied with the numbers.Lou Ming watched the little girl gleefully pressing the keypad, assuming that she was about to earn 100,000. It seems that she was a little money grubber.Chen Yu dialed the number, which rang for a long time before it transferred to voicemail.\u201dHow is it?\u201d The male ghost asked nervously.Chen Yu then made another call, and no one answered: \u201cNo one answered the phone ah. Otherwise I\u2019ll send a message.\u201d\u201cYou want 100,000 yuan for sending a message, do you want to be black\u2026ruthless.\u201d The male ghost had a difficult time substituting the word \u2018black\u2019.\u201dThen what do you say?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help if the other person doesn\u2019t answer the phone.\u201cI don\u2019t care. Anyway, you\u2019re the only one who can see me. I will follow you until my Second Uncle comes.\u201d\u00a0If I let this little girl run away, when can I meet another Heavenly Master again?\u00a0He\u2019s a good young man and he doesn\u2019t want to die young.\u201dYou screwed me over, right.\u201d\u201dAdd another 100,000.\u201d The male ghost extended both hands.Chen Yu blinked, turned to look at Lou Ming pleasantly and said, \u201cThird Brother, let him stay in the car. He\u2019s giving me another 100,000 yuan. When I get to the courtyard, I\u2019ll take him back to my house, so it won\u2019t affect you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not good to let him know where you live.\u201d Lou Ming reminded.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, if he\u2019s lucky enough to survive, he won\u2019t have the memory of this when he wakes up. If he\u2019s unlucky, I\u2019ll just directly send him to the Underworld.\u201d Chen Yu replied indifferently.\u201cOkay, then let him sit on my side.\u201d Whether it was a pervert or not, it was better for it not to sit next to the little girl.Lou Ming had experienced holding hands with the male ghost before. Naturally, this time there was no pressure from riding in the same car with the male ghost. Tian Fei, who was driving, looked at the empty seat through the rearview mirror. He suffered from a chilly back for a while.Fuck, Laozi walked countless times between the line of life and death but has never been so afraid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lou Ming had never publicly announced that his family\u2019s courtyard and garden were restricted areas. However, the elites in the other courtyards had a tacit understanding. Even if they were curious, they weren\u2019t allowed to walk near the area surrounding it.Additionally, the two houses in front of the Lou family\u2019s courtyard had already been vacated. They were now used by the special soldiers who protected Lou Ming.\u201dThird Brother, I\u2019m going first.\u201d Chen Yu was about to get off with the shopping bag.\u201dGirl,\u201d Lou Ming suddenly stopped Chen Yu.\u201dEn?\u201d Chen Yu turned around in doubt.Lou Ming\u2019s eyes turned to look at the space beside her. Although he couldn\u2019t see it, Lou Ming could see the cold energy. \u201cYou take this\u2026go back and be careful when you\u2019re home. Don\u2019t talk to it while your home. After all, not everyone believes there are ghosts in this world.\u201d\u201dI know la.\u201d Chen Yu smiled sweetly. \u201cI\u2019ll pay attention when I\u2019m at home. I don\u2019t want to scare my mom.\u201d\u201dJust know.\u201d Lou Ming nodded.Chen Yu opened the door and got out of the car. Lou Ming was about to signal Tian Fei to drive the car into the yard, when he saw the girl suddenly look back in. She had a wrinkled face and looked at him at a loss.\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lou Ming asked in surprise.\u201cThird Brother, do you have any misunderstandings about me?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201dMisunderstanding? No.\u201d Lou Ming blanked look at her.\u201cYou deliberately reminded me just now ah. I\u2019ve been catching ghosts since I was eight years old. I have ten years of exorcism experience. How could I not be vigilant?\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s face was aggrieved as if he looked down on her and continued, \u201cWhy do you think I talked to this guy at the mall just now?\u201d Chen Yu pointed to the male ghost who was by her side. \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re here ah, Third Brother.\u201dLou Ming blinked doubtfully: \u201cBecause of me?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re here. So, when I speak, others will think I\u2019m talking to you ah.\u201d Chen Yu said naturally, \u201cOtherwise I wouldn\u2019t have been like that.\u201dChen Yu often directly communicated with ghosts when she went out with her grandpa. Old Wu always mediated for her with outsiders, so they thought she was talking to her grandpa. Moreover, Chen Yu\u2019s character was already strange. She was short-tempered and ghosts easily stimulated her. When there was no one around, she remembered not to behave abnormally. However, once there was a trustworthy person around, it was easy for her to be impulsive. Especially when she met this male ghost with a cheap mouth.\u201dSo that\u2019s why ah.\u201d For some reason, Lou Ming suddenly felt a little happy.\u201dBut I also have some problems. My grandfather reminded me before that I need to stop being short-tempered and change it,\u201d Chen Yu said with annoyance.\u201dIt\u2019s okay, you\u2019re still young, it\u2019s normal.\u201d Lou Ming saw the usually sunny little girl was frowning and couldn\u2019t help but gently comfort her.\u201cI\u2019ll try my best to change it. But if I don\u2019t, then Third Brother, I can only ask you to continue helping me cover it up,\u201d Chen Yu cheekily asked.\u201dOkay.\u201d Lou Ming nodded with a smile.\u201dThen I\u2019m leaving. Goodbye Third Brother.\u201d Chen Yu smiled and waved her hand.\u201dGoodbye,\u201d Lou Ming replied in a good mood.The male ghost followed Chen Yu. On the way home, the ghost shook his head with a\u00a0tsk tsk\u00a0as he walked. \u201cThis little girl isn\u2019t experienced, but is very good at flirting. That dude unexpectedly has a pure heart ah.\u201dChen Yu didn\u2019t understand what the male ghost was talking about. She didn\u2019t respond and rolled her eyes at him in disgust.As soon as she returned to the Chen family\u2019s home with the ghost in tow, Mother Chen saw her daughter who had left early in the morning and came back in the afternoon. She couldn\u2019t help but ask curiously, \u201cShishi, why did you come back so early?\u201d\u201cA classmate suddenly had something to do, so we left in advance.\u201d Chen Yu used the excuse she had prepared beforehand.\u201dDid you buy that dress?\u201d Mother Chen asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Chen Yu moved the shopping bag that was behind her forward.\u201dLet me see.\u201d\u00a0Finally, I can discuss clothes with my daughter like other family\u2019s mothers.\u00a0Mother Chen took out the clothes that Chen Yu bought and looked at them with excitement. She praised, \u201cOur family\u2019s Shishi\u2019s eyes are really good. You must look good in this dress.\u201dChen Yu smiled sheepishly.\u201dIt turns out that your family\u2019s aesthetic is hereditary ah,\u201d the male ghost suddenly said with an enlightened face.Chen Yu clenched her first and desperately resisted the urge to beat the ghost.\u201cBy the way, your brother will come back for dinner in the evening. Our family hasn\u2019t had a family meal together in a long time.\u201dChen Yu went to military training for an entire month before, and Chen Yang seemed to be investigating a case recently. He only returned home once every ten days. Today was the rare occasion when he came home, so Mother Chen said this.\u201dMom, I\u2019ll take a shower first. I\u2019ve been out all-day walking and I\u2019m covered in sweat,\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cOkay okay okay. Take a nap if you\u2019re tired too.\u201d Mother Chen put away the clothes into the bag and gave it back to her daughter.Chen Yu took the bag and walked upstairs. As soon as she hung her new clothes in the closet, she heard the ghost behind her mutter, \u201cTo think the room I entered doesn\u2019t belong to a fragrant beauty. Unexpectedly I had an out-of-body experience, but actually entered a little girl\u2019s room instead.\u201dAt the end of her patience, Chen Yu no longer endured and slapped the male ghost out of the wall.The male ghost roared and squawked. He floated in from the window again and angrily said, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201dIf you talk again, I don\u2019t need the 200,000,\u201d Chen Yu threatened with narrowed eyes.\u201dDon\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t.\u201d The male ghost immediately counseled, \u201cI\u2019m wrong, I won\u2019t talk nonsense anymore, that\u2026 you try to call again, maybe my Second Uncle is back.\u201dChen Yu also wanted to get rid of this ghost as soon as possible. So, she took out her cellphone and dialed the number that she had called twice before, but it still went to voicemail.\u201dI still can\u2019t get through.\u201d Chen Yu threw her cellphone on the bed and sat there cross-legged.\u201dWhy can\u2019t it go through\u2026\u201d The male ghost wanted to grab Chen Yu\u2019s cellphone.\u201cStop, you stand and step back. Sit on the chair over there.\u201d Chen Yu prevented the male ghost from approaching her.\u00a0A desolate male ghost and a girl were alone together in the room, still have to pay attention.The male ghost took several steps back under Chen Yu\u2019s stare. He stood on the edge of the chair and didn\u2019t dare move forward. He anxiously said, \u201cCan\u2019t you just send me back? Isn\u2019t it a very simple thing for a Heavenly Master to send the living soul back into their body?\u201d\u201cI already told you, I\u2019m an exorcist. I only do exorcism. I don\u2019t save people.\u201d Old Wu had warned Chen Yu since she was young that because of the special skills they practiced, they were much more capable in exorcism than other Heavenly Masters. But in other aspects, their skills were lethal. If Chen Yu used her spiritual power to send a living soul back to its body, after the living soul woke up, the soul would be damaged. Thus, the body would also be damaged. So, Chen Yu would only send the ghost back to his body as a last resort.\u201cWhere on earth did Second Uncle go? I\u2019ve been lost for more than ten days and he didn\u2019t even look for me,\u201d he said anxiously.\u201cMore than ten days?\u201d Chen Yu, who had been playing with her cell phone, suddenly looked up. \u201cA living soul can\u2019t return after being away from the body for more than seven days, but you\u2026\u201d Chen Yu carefully looked again. He clearly had the aura of a living soul ah.\u201dI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d The male ghost just had a second uncle who was a Heavenly Master and didn\u2019t know much about metaphysics himself.Chen Yu lowered her head thoughtfully and opened up the group chat, \u201cGods and Ghosts Don\u2019t Ask\u201d, and took the initiative to speak in the group for the first time.I Want To Fix Road: Fellow friends, under what circumstances can a living soul stay alive for more than ten days?Taoist Priest Feng Huo: Did you meet a living soul?Cassia Seed: A living soul that is still alive after more than ten days must be protected by a special magic weapon.Taoist Priest Feng Huo: Fellow friend ah, it\u2019s best to return the living soul to its body.March Floating Rain: Yes yes, Deity, quickly send this living soul back. It\u2019s easy to cause trouble ah.Chen Yu looked at the sudden appearance of March Floating Rain and couldn\u2019t help but asked strangely: \u201cWhy?\u201dThis was also asked by Cassia Seed.March Floating Rain: I don\u2019t know the specifics. I only know that the Heavenly Masters\u2019 Headquarters has paid special attention to matters regarding living souls recently. Many Heavenly Masters have been summoned.Taoist Priest Feng Huo: I heard a little about it. It seems that something has been maliciously devouring living souls.Devouring living souls?\u00a0Chen Yu looked up at the male ghost with the ruddy complexion that was opposite to her. He didn\u2019t look like a ghost at all. She certainly couldn\u2019t deny that if he was floating outside for more than ten days, he would have been devoured sooner or later.Taoist Priest Feng Huo: Makes sense.March Floating Rain: Anyway, it\u2019s best to send them off as soon as possible.I Want To Fix Road: I see, thank you.Chen Yu put down her cellphone, reached out, and pulled out two pieces of soul restricting talismans from the burlap bag beside the bed. She raised her hand and flicked them. The talismans flew towards the nearby ghost.The male ghost who suddenly had talismans pasted on him couldn\u2019t move. He anxiously said, \u201cWhat are you doing? Why can\u2019t I move?\u201d\u201dI\u2019m going to take a nap, and I don\u2019t want you to move,\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cYou\u2019re just going to sleep, why stop me, I\u2026\u201dChen Yu threw another talisman and it immediately became quiet. With a comfortable smile, Chen Yu covered herself with the blanket and didn\u2019t turn on the air conditioning.\u00a0There\u2019s a ghost anyway, so there\u2019s no need to waste electricity.Chen Yu slept until dinner time, and under the ghost\u2019s glare, she walked out of the door and went downstairs to eat.At this time, in a high-rise apartment in the center of the city, a middle-aged man in a dark long gown stood besides the bedside a young man. He stared at the trembling jade plate beside the youth\u2019s pillow and frowned tightly.\u201dMaster.\u201d At this time, a young man pushed open the door and said, \u201cIt seems that you have some missed calls.\u201dThe middle-aged man took out his cellphone and looked at the strange number. He hesitated for a moment before choosing not to call back. As the Grandmaster of Feng Shui,1\u00a0he had countless dignitaries that usually competed with each other to seek his expertise. But now that his nephew had an accident, he wasn\u2019t in the mood to perform Feng Shui.\u201dMaster, has Young Master Tong been found?\u201d the disciple asked worriedly.\u201dNot yet.\u201d Two weeks ago, his nephew Tong Chao suddenly fell into a coma. Fortunately, he arrived in time and found that Tong Chao was unnaturally induced into a coma. His soul was detached from his body through a spell. Recalling the several cases of living souls being devoured in the last month, Tong Wei immediately protected Tong Chao with the Lingtai Immortal Soul Jade. Then, he took his nephew out of the hospital and arranged this uninhabited apartment for him.However, while this Lingtai Immortal Soul Jade protected Tong Chao, it also blocked the connection between body and soul. Although the malevolent ghost who devoured living soul couldn\u2019t find Tong Chao, at the same time, he also couldn\u2019t find Tong Chao himself.These days, he sent out countless people who brought back hundreds of ghosts, but none of them were Tong Chao.\u201cThis jade plate is vibrating violently, isn\u2019t it\u2026\u201d The young discipline seemed to have thought of something and his face turned pale.\u201cGo get my wooden peach sword and compass,\u201d Tong Wei said in a deep voice. \u201cAs soon as the jade plate is broken, it will be up to me to find Little Chao before the malevolent ghost.\u201dAnd Chen Yu, who didn\u2019t know anything about this, was happily eating dinner with her family.Author\u2019s Notes:In the evening, Tian Fei traded shifts and return to the dormitory.He Qi: What did Third Young Master and the Chen family\u2019s girl do today?Tian Fei: They went shopping after eating and bought clothes. I paid for the clothes on Third Young Master\u2019s behalf.He Qi: Well done.Tian Fei: Third Young Master said that the sofa is too hard.All of the assistants looked at each other, took out their cellphones one after another and looked for soft cute feminine pillows. They wanted to make the Chen family\u2019s girl feel at home in the Lou\u2019s home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She personally filled a bowl of chicken soup, handed it to her son, and said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t had a good meal in the past few weeks. How many times have I told you\u2014 no matter how busy you are on the case, you need to remember to eat.\u201d\u201dI know.\u201d Chen Yang raised his head and smiled at his mother.Mayor Chen knew his son was busy during right now with the case, so he asked, \u201cHow\u2019s the case going?\u201d\u201dIt was transferred to the Special Operations team,\u201d Chen Yang replied.\u201dSpecial Operations team?\u201d Mayor Chen was surprised. \u201cSo, it was handed over quickly?\u201dThe Special Operations team was specially used to investigate cases that were unsolvable for years. In fact, it was said that if a case was transferred to the Special Operations team, the case would be closed.Mayor Chen strongly disagreed with this practice, but the Special Operations team was directly under the leadership of the Central Committee. Thus, Mayor Chen couldn\u2019t refute, even if he disagreed.\u201dYeah ah. It was suddenly announced this morning.\u201d Chen Yang really didn\u2019t understand. His team members worked hard for nearly a month. Although they had no clues, the case had only been investigated for one month. Thus, everyone was naturally wasn\u2019t reconciled to it being declared an unsolvable case.Mayor Chen frowned, and his eating slowed.Mother Chen said with some displeasure, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about the case while eating. Quickly eat.\u201dMayor Chen suddenly returned to his senses. After eating two mouthfuls of rice, he looked at his daughter and softly said, \u201cShishi, try not to go out alone during this time.\u201d\u201dEn?\u201d Chen Yu, who was eating, raised her head a little puzzled.\u201dYes,\u201d Chen Yang echoed. \u201cEight people have died in a row within a month. There are still no clues on the murderer. Shishi, when you go out, try to be with your classmates.\u201d\u201dEight people?\u201d Mother Chen was surprised and said, \u201cSo many?\u201d Mother Chen already knew that her son was investigating a murder case, but she didn\u2019t know that so many people had died and there still weren\u2019t any clues on who the murderer was.\u201cWas there anything in common with the dead?\u201d Mayor Chen couldn\u2019t help but ask again.\u201dNo.\u201d Chen Yang said, \u201cSome of them suddenly collapsed while eating in a restaurant, while some fell on their way to work in the morning. Others didn\u2019t wake up when they were sleeping at home at night. All of them were sudden deaths. But the autopsy report showed that they were in good health and weren\u2019t sick. If there was anything they had in common, three of the eight dead were born in the same year, same month and same day.\u201d\u201dWhat day?\u201d Mayor Chen asked.\u201dJuly 7, 3028,\u201d Chen Yang replied.\u201cYin year, yin month and yin day?\u201d Chen Yu suddenly said out loud, causing everyone at the dining table to look at her.\u201dWhat did you say?\u201d Chen Yang asked.\u201cI mean it\u2019s a yin birth year, yin month and yin day.\u201d Chen Yu explained to her puzzled family. She continued with a smile, \u201cWhen I was a child, grandpa always took me out to do things for others. I\u2019ve seen a lot of things and know the meanings of the date.\u201dChen Yang looked back thoughtfully.Mother Chen saw that everyone stopped eating again and urged again, \u201cOkay, okay. Don\u2019t talk about the case, eat quickly. Shishi, don\u2019t go out alone in the future, okay?\u201d\u201dEn,\u201d Chen Yu called out softly, and then buried her head and continued eating.After dinner, Chen Yu returned to her room early because she left the ghost alone upstairs. When Tong Chao saw Chen Yu returning, he immediately blew on his beard anxiously and glared at the other person to release him.Chen Yu raised her hand and retrieved the talismans.\u201cHow can you do this? I asked you to find a way to send me back to my body. I didn\u2019t ask you to catch me.\u201d As soon as Tong Chao was free, he angrily rushed to Chen Yu and yelled.\u201dIf you fight again\u2026\u201d Chen Yu raised the talismans in her hand.Tong Chao, who had suffered many hardships, turned pale. \u201cThen can you call my Second Uncle again?\u201d He didn\u2019t want to be around this girl anymore.Chen Yu turned around and picked up her cellphone from the table. She flipped through her call history and said, \u201cI\u2019ve made so many calls, but your Second Uncle never returned them ah.\u201d\u201cMy Second Uncle is busy. He doesn\u2019t have time to call an unfamiliar number back.\u201d Even he himself hasn\u2019t return an unfamiliar number\u2019s call before. After all, there were too many people who asked him to design clothes for them through the back door. So, Tong Chao could understand his Second Uncle\u2019s reasoning. But too bad that it felt awful when this reasoning was applied to himself.\u201cHurry and call him again,\u201d Tong Chao urged. He didn\u2019t know why, but his heart suddenly became very uneasy.Chen Yu listened and pressed the call back button.At the same time, Tong Wei, who was staying in a high-end apartment, stared at the increasingly fierce vibration of the jade plate at the bed. With a compass in his left hand, and a talisman in his right, he would immediately look for his nephew\u2019s location as soon as the jade plate shattered.Ding ling ling\u2026Suddenly a cellphone rang. Second Uncle didn\u2019t bother with it and continued to stare at the jade plate at the head of the bed. The discipline next to him picked up the phone from the desk, and it was the same number from the afternoon. He said, \u201cMaster, it\u2019s the same phone number from before. They\u2019ve called you five times since the afternoon.\u201dAt this time, Tong Wei\u2019s entire body was focused on his nephew. How could he spare the effort to answer the phone? He angrily replied, \u201cPlease make the other person stop calling.\u201dTong Wei\u2019s voice was a little loud. The scared disciple\u2019s hand trembled and directly ended the pending call.\u201dHung up?\u201d Chen Yu looked up in surprise.\u201cWhy did it drop? If it hung up, it means that the phone is in my Second Uncle\u2019s hand ah. Call again,\u201d Tong Chao said excitedly.As a result, the disciple didn\u2019t even have time to put the phone down before it immediately rang again.\u201dTurn it off.\u201d Tong Wei was furious.The young disciple obediently pressed the power button. Before the screen turned off completely, the cellphone received a message. The young disciple vaguely saw the words \u201cTong Chao,\u201d and froze for a moment. He turned the phone back on and looked at the message.Your nephew Tong Chao is in my hands.Tong Chao was so mad when he saw what Chen Yu had sent. \u201cHow can you send that message? At a glance, it looks like a malicious message, okay? It looks like you\u2019re a kidnapper.\u201d\u201cThe missing words \u2018living soul\u2019 were also sent.\u201d Chen Yu then comforted him saying, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that your Second Master is a Heavenly Master? He will definitely understand it. So, don\u2019t worry.\u201dAs Chen Yu guessed, Second Master really did understand. When the young disciple read the message, his voice trembled with excitement. \u201cMaster look.\u201dTong Wei lowered his eyes and immediately put down the soul-chasing talisman in his hand. He snatched his phone from his disciple\u2019s hand, and immediately called back the number. \u201cI\u2019m Tong Wei.\u201d\u201cIs your Second Uncle\u2019s name Tong Wei?\u201d Tong Wei heard the voice of a young girl who seemed to be talking to someone else, and his eyes immediately lit up.\u201dSecond Uncle, your nephew is in my hands now\u2026 I know, I know.\u201d The last two phrases were obviously not directed at Tong Wei. \u201cIt\u2019s Tong Chao\u2019s living soul that\u2019s with me right now. Come and take him away.\u201d\u201dTong Chao is with you?\u201d Tong Wei stood up excitedly.\u201dYeah ah. But he promised to give me 200,000. You come and get him\u2026No, remember to transfer the money to me before you come pick up the living soul ah,\u201d Chen Yu demanded. Otherwise, when Tong Chao returned to his body, he would forget his memories from when he was a living soul. Then who could she get her money from?\u201dYou\u2026\u201d Tong Wei was about to speak but heard a crisp \u201cpa\u201d sound in the room. He turned his head, looked at the broken jade plate, and his face suddenly changed.\u201dMaster, the jade plate is broken,\u201d the young disciple exclaimed.\u201dAre you also a Heavenly Master??\u201d Tong Wei asked eagerly.\u201dYeah ah,\u201d Chen Yu replied, as if that was obvious.\u201dI\u2019ll give you two million.\u201d\u201dPfff\u2026\u201d There was a sound of something spurting from the other end of the call.\u201cBefore I come to you, you help me protect him for me. I\u2019ll give you two million.\u201d Tong Wei repeated.Chen Yu hung up the phone as if in a dream, and looked at Tong Chao with a magical expression.\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong? What did my Second Uncle say?\u201d Tong Chao asked anxiously.\u201cYour Second Uncle is so concerned about you that he took the initiative to increase the price to two million.\u201d Chen Yu held out two fingers and incredulously said, \u201cIt seems that your family is really rich.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t say. This little grandpa\u2019s net worth is several hundred million.\u201d Tong Chao asked again, \u201cWhen will my Second Uncle be here?\u201d\u201cHe said that it would take him about an hour to get here, and to let me protect you.\u201d Chen Yu felt there was something fishy. She looked at Tong Chao and asked why he specially mentioned to protect him.\u201dThen you have to protect me ah.\u201d When Tong Chao heard his Second Uncle would come in an hour, he immediately got up again. Then, he sat on the chair in Chen Yu\u2019s room with his legs arrogantly crossed.Chen Yu was essentially a simple teenager. She thought that making a phone call for 200,000 was a lot, but she deliberately increased the price because the other person was really annoying. But the other person\u2019s Second Uncle suddenly raised the amount to two million, which made Chen Yu\u2019s heart feel a little uneasy. She didn\u2019t know why, and wasn\u2019t sure if the Consumer Association1\u00a0would care about this. She felt like a black-hearted peddler.Chen Yu thought of this, turned around, and rummaged through her sackcloth bag again. She took out an advanced defensive talisman. She turned around, and handed it to Tong Chao.When Tong Chao saw Chen Yu pull out another talisman, he immediately flew from his chair to the corner of the wall. \u201cYou\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhat are you nervous about?\u201d Chen Yu wasn\u2019t in a good mood. \u201cYour Second Uncle gave me two million yuan. I can\u2019t take advantage of you either. This is a defensive talisman that my grandpa personally drew. I only have three. This kind of advanced talisman might not even be available on the market, and is worth more than one million.\u201dChen Yu didn\u2019t lie about this. After lurking for a period of time on the \u201cGods and Ghosts Don\u2019t Ask\u201d group chat, Chen Yu roughly understood the market price of talismans.There were primary talismans that started at 100,000, whereas intermediate talismans started at 200,000. Advanced talismans ranged from half a million to a million, depending on their appearance and function. The talismans personally drawn by her old man for self-defense were the absolute best. Therefore, this talisman was easily worth more than 1 million.\u201dWhy did you suddenly give me such an advanced talisman?\u201d Tong Chao was also a person who had seen the world. Usually, his Second Uncle got millions of dollars when he went out for Feng Shui. Therefore, even though he felt that Chen Yu\u2019s talisman was a little expensive, he didn\u2019t believe her.\u201cIt\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s only for the time being.\u201d Chen Yu continued, \u201cYour Second Uncle spent two million yuan for me to protect you. I have to show a gesture of goodwill.\u201dTong Chao\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201dRemember to pay me back when you leave.\u201d Chen Yu handed over the talisman again.\u201dI know la,\u201d Tong Chao replied angrily. He raised his hand and took the talisman. He looked at it in his hand for a long time but didn\u2019t find anything different.Chen Yu looked at the time and said, \u201cWhen it\u2019s almost time, we\u2019ll go to the gate. I\u2019ll tell your Second Uncle to meet us there.\u201d\u201dOK.\u201d Tong Chao took the talisman and arrogantly sat on the chair again. He looked at the girl sitting cross legged on the bed and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you save my number? For the sake of helping me once, I can design for you for free.\u201d\u201dNo thank you,\u201d Chen Yu said without lifting her head.\u201cDon\u2019t regret it. Once you find out who I am, I won\u2019t pay attention to you later,\u201d Tong Chao said angrily.\u201dHehe\u2026\u201d Chen Yu returned a sneer.Tong Chao was angry. He thought this girl was too ignorant and decided not to stick his hot face on her cold butt anymore.2\u00a0When he returned to his body, he wouldn\u2019t care about this unsophisticated scummy girl anymore.The room was quiet for a moment. Ten minutes later, Chen Yu suddenly heard a vibration. She quickly raised her head, got up, and took out the flashing red compass from the cloth bag.\u201dIs that a compass? My Second Uncle also has one, but why is yours glowing red?\u201d Tong Zhao, who hadn\u2019t spoken for ten minutes, asked.Chen Yu ignored Tong Chao. She jumped out of bed and walked to the window in her slippers. She felt a ferocious energy approaching from outside and frowned tightly.\u201dHelp me protect him.\u201dChen Yu recalled the words of the Tong family\u2019s Second Uncle from twenty minutes ago. She suddenly couldn\u2019t help but ridicule, \u201cSure enough, it really isn\u2019t easy to make money.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Fierce BattleThe red light from the compass was to warn Chen Yu of the malevolent energy that was constantly approaching from outside the window, and the abnormal speed almost left Chen Yu without time to finish her preparations.She turned around and picked up the linen bag filled with talismans and the compass from the table, and casually slung it on her body. She even didn\u2019t have time to change out of her slippers before she stepped on the windowsill to jump down.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tong Chao couldn\u2019t help but ask suddenly, seeing the rapid change on Chen Yu\u2019s face, and that she had grabbed a bag and was about to jump off.Almost forgot, there\u2019s still this guy ah.Chen Yu reached out and grabbed Tong Chao\u2019s arm, raised her hand, and threw him out the window, before jumping down accompanied by Tong Chao\u2019s screams of horror.\u201cAre you trying to murder me?!\u201d Tong Chao furiously questioned after he finally stabilized his body and floated back to Chen Yu again.\u201cShut up if you don\u2019t want to die.\u201d Chen Yu pulled out an Intermediate level Expelling Talisman from her linen bag, and ran to the north of the compound almost without hesitation.This malevolent ghost\u2019s evil energy was so strong that Chen Yu had already perceived the danger even before she got close, which was why she couldn\u2019t fight it in a place with lots of people. In the entire compound, there was only a small empty park north of Lou Ming\u2019s small courtyard where she could move freely.It was inconvenient for Chen Yu to wear slippers, so she hurriedly took them off her feet and ran forward barefoot.Tong Chao, who thought that Chen Yu was just suddenly feeling nervous, also found that there was something wrong at this time. The little girl\u2019s expressions and movements indicated that something was about to happen.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Tong Chao asked nervously behind Chen Yu.\u201cIt\u2019s up to you whether you can hold on until your Second Uncle comes or not.\u201d As she spoke, a cloud of an overwhelmingly dark evil even blacker than the night was approaching quickly. Even if her Yin Yang eyes were not open, Chen Yu could clearly see the dense evil energy.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Tong Chao suddenly felt a chill. It was strange since he hadn\u2019t felt anything after he became a spirit.\u201cRun forward.\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s feet didn\u2019t stop. One person and one spirit kept on running until they arrived at a house in front of the small park.This house was where the special soldiers who protected Lou Ming resided in. At this time, He Qi, who was smoking by the window on the second floor, suddenly heard movements on the ground. He looked down and found Chen Yu. He couldn\u2019t help but mutter, \u201cIt seems that the little girl from the Chen family likes our Third Young Master very much, they only parted ways this afternoon ah.\u201dBecause souls had no weight, it moved faster than Chen Yu. Tong Chao felt the danger from that black aura, and after hearing Chen Yu\u2019s instructions, he flew first in the direction of the small park. However, the black aura moved with speed that was obviously faster than him, and it arrived in front in the blink of an eye.Chen Yu saw that the black aura seemed to chase Tong Chao directly, so she no longer hesitated and threw the Intermediate Expelling Talisman in her hand into the air.With a\u00a0thud, the Expelling Talisman collided with the darkness, turning into a blue flame before disappearing into thin air. The black energy in the air stagnated, seeming like it had just found Chen Yu\u2019s existence, and stopped in front of her.Can\u2019t even see the body?Chen Yu looked at the strong dark spirit in front of her with a shocked expression; she couldn\u2019t even see the ghost\u2019s body. Indeed, only a powerful ghost like this could have such strong evil energy. Holding an Advanced Expelling Talisman, Chen Yu\u2019s hand shook a bit.Boom!A small lump of black gas suddenly separated from the dark spirit and slammed into Chen Yu. She raised a hand that was laced with her concentrated spiritual power to block the attack, but it couldn\u2019t match the violent and vicious aura and she was directly hit and blown away.He Qi, who was watching from the second floor, saw Chen Yu suddenly fly out of nowhere; his expression was one of shock. He had been with Third Young Master for a long time, so he naturally knew one or two things about metaphysics. He guessed that there must be something chasing Chen Yu there.He Qi was about to take a closer look at what happened when Chen Yu got up from the ground and continued to run back.That\u2019s the direction towards Third Young Master.\u201cThird Young Master!\u201d He Qi was shocked. He ran back to the room and took out his radio, then quickly rushed to the window behind the house to assess the situation outside. He saw that Chen Yu didn\u2019t run to Lou Ming\u2019s yard, but ran to the small park beside it instead, so He Qi put his radio down slowly.\u00a0[T/N: radio = walkie-talkie]Chen Yu chased the black aura all the way to the park, but its speed was too fast and it left her behind and caught up with Tong Chao in less than a second. She saw the black aura suddenly swell up like a huge black cloth and wrap around Tong Chao\u2019s entire soul.With a golden flash of light, the black cloth was shaken away by a powerful spiritual force.At the same time, in a bathing center some thousand miles away, an old man whose feet were being comfortably massaged suddenly opened his eyes.\u201cMr. Lao, was my massage too strong?\u201d the little brother who was massaging him asked carefully, seeing that the old man\u2019s face was wrong,\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, continue ah.\u201d The old man paused for a bit, before closing his eyes again and sat back down on the chair.That little girl\u2019s life isn\u2019t short so she wouldn\u2019t die. En, let\u2019s continue my massage session ah.Chen Yu took advantage of this gap and ran over to protect Tong Chao behind her.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d When Tong Chao was enveloped inside the black aura, he felt that he was almost swallowed by it.\u201cGet out of the way.\u201d Chen Yu took out five Intermediate Expelling Talismans from her linen bag.One million is gone, my heart hurts.Tong Chao didn\u2019t dare to be too far from Chen Yu. He understood at that moment that the target of this black aura was himself, but Chen Yu obviously couldn\u2019t beat that aura\u2019s speed. If he ran far away, Chen Yu wouldn\u2019t be able to save him in time, so he decided to hang around her. Thinking of this, Tong Chao clenched the Defensive Talisman in his hand, and stood two meters behind Chen Yu with fear.Chen Yu raised her hand and threw five talismans which formed a pentagon. They stuck themselves onto the black aura while their spiritual energy linked and emitted a light golden ray that burst out in a mere second. With a bang, the black aura churned and wafted all around, diffusing a dense and strong dark mist, before finally revealing an obscure silhouette within.It was a very tall and big figure. This malevolent spirit was probably a very robust man before his death, but\u2026 how come this evil spirit was so full of vitality?Even a living soul\u2019s vitality would be very weak because of their spirit state. Nevertheless, this completely dead evil spirit still possessed vitality close to a living person. If it wasn\u2019t because she had seen him floating around from a distance just now, coupled with the dense, dark evil energy around him, Chen Yu would almost think that he was a normal human.\u201cWhy do you have such strong vitality?\u201d Chen Yu held the compass in her left hand and talismans in her right hand while looking at the man inside the black mist with vigilance.However at this time, He Qi, who witnessed blue flames and golden light burst out of thin air and forming a pentagram, was gaping with a dumbstruck expression.He Qi had encountered metaphysics situations, and he knew that there was a Spirit Gathering Array arranged by Master Mao in the Lou family\u2019s small courtyard, but apart from feeling very comfortable inside it, He Qi didn\u2019t notice any other differences. Even when he accompanied Third Young Master to Imperial University every year to ward his evil spirit using propitious energy, he had never once seen the so-called evil spirit manifesting in front of his naked eyes. Even though he had been with Third Young Master for many years, except for feeling mentally exhausted from feeling the evil spirit, He Qi hadn\u2019t really experienced one.However, the light bursting out from Chen Yu\u2019s spell just now was the first time He Qi had truly seen that mysterious thing visually.\u201cTian Fei.\u201d He Qi no longer hesitated and picked up his radio.\u201cLeader, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Tian Fei\u2019s voice came from the intercom.\u201cThe little girl from Chen family seems to be in trouble,\u201d He Qi said.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d asked Lou Ming through the intercom.As the words \u201cChen Yu\u201d fell, the evil spirit whose head was hanging low jerked up, staring straight at Chen Yu with a pair of dark eyes devoid of any light.Chen Yu shouted\u00a0\u201cbad\u201d\u00a0in her heart, before she saw that quietly standing evil spirit suddenly turned into an afterimage and rushed towards her.Chen Yu rolled and ducked aside.The evil spirit didn\u2019t bother with Chen Yu. Seeing that the obstacle was removed, he immediately rushed towards Tong Chao.\u201cAH!\u201dThe evil spirit opened his mouth as he pounced on Tong Chao, and the previously normal sized mouth became gaped wide as it approached Tong Chao. The terrified Tong Chao could only close his eyes and scream.BOOM!Another burst of golden light flashed, and the evil spirit was bounced out once again.Wulao, who already had his feet massaged and was now in the middle of pedicure, opened his eyes again. \u201cSecond time.\u201d\u201cMr. Lao, do you need anything else?\u201d The little brother asked quickly.\u201cNothing.\u201d\u00a0A high level Defensive Charm can be used up to three times, hope that girl can finish her matter before the third time, otherwise she could be injured. Forget it, since that girl\u00a0won't\u00a0die anyway, I\u2019ll just continue my pedicure.\u00a0Thus, Wulao continued to close his eyes comfortably.A spell could only be used three times. Now that it had been used twice, once more and Tong Chao might die.The talismans in Chen Yu\u2019s bag were like money flowing out, flying one by one to that evil spirit, and every time one flew out, Chen Yu\u2019s heart seemed to be stabbed with a sharp knife. It was all money ah.One after another, blue lights lit up in the sky, as if fireworks were ignited in full bloom in the dark night. This was what He Qi saw when he ran over with five brothers.These six people had encountered big scenes before, and it wasn\u2019t a problem to put one of them against seven outside, but the situation in front of them now was beyond weird. They couldn\u2019t even see the enemy; they didn\u2019t know where to start even if they wanted to help.At this time, the evil spirit seemed to finally realize that if this annoying Celestial Master wasn\u2019t taken care of, he wouldn\u2019t be able to swallow the soul in front of him. Thus, he changed his target to Chen Yu, and appeared in front of her in the blink of an eye. Before Chen Yu had time to react, he released a black mist that knocked Chen Yu away.The evil spirit chased after her immediately while both of his hands turned into claws, aiming straight towards Chen Yu\u2019s heart.With a buzzing sound, the compass spun rapidly, exuding a faint golden light between Chen Yu and the evil spirit, preventing the other party from getting closer.\u201cMiss Chen Yu.\u201d Seeing Chen Yu flying upside down, He Qi rushed to chase after her anxiously. Who knew that they were blocked by an invisible cyclone just two meters apart from her.\u201cYou guys\u2026 don\u2019t come.\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s eyes almost couldn\u2019t crack open because of the violent gusts of malevolent wind.\u201cWhat are you guys doing? Go and save her!\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s voice suddenly came from He Qi\u2019s intercom.He Qi was taken aback. He turned his head to look at the house next to the park and saw Lou Ming standing there in front of a small window.Several brothers behind He Qi rushed forward again after hearing Third Young Master\u2019s command, but they were still blocked by that invisible wall.\u201cThird Young Master, we can\u2019t get inside.\u201d He Qi was also anxious; it was rare for Third Young Master to care so much about a person. If she got into an accident in front of Third Young Master, then He Qi didn\u2019t dare imagine the consequences.The distant Lou Ming was also burning with impatience. If he lost his rationality, he would be dying to rush out and save her himself. But he still remembered that the little girl told him that his evil aura would just make the evil spirit stronger.Lou Ming felt hatred towards the evil spirit in his body once more. He clenched his fist and slammed it against the wall.\u201cThird Young Master,\u201d Tian Fei couldn\u2019t help but shout.\u201cHe Qi.\u201d Lou Ming forced himself to calm down. \u201cAsk the little girl what you guys can do for her.\u201dHe Qi immediately asked Chen Yu, who was using the compass to resist the invisible power, \u201cMiss Chen Yu, is there anything that we can do for you?\u201dChen Yu turned her head laboriously. She seemed to have heard Third Brother\u2019s voice just now. Her eyes lit up instantly and she shouted, \u201cI put two talismans under the coffee table in Third Brother\u2019s living room, go and get them!\u201dAlmost immediately after Chen Yu\u2019s words fell, Lou Ming rushed downstairs and pulled out two talismans from under the coffee table. A red light appeared the moment the yellow talismans fell into his hand, but Lou Ming didn\u2019t pay attention. He turned around and handed the talismans to Tian Fei. \u201cSend it right away.\u201dTian Fei didn\u2019t dare to delay and rushed out immediately, sending them over in under a minute.\u201cMiss Chen\u2019s talisman is here, what should I do with it?\u201d He Qi asked quickly.\u201cTh\u2026 throw them in!\u201d Chen Yu struggled to maintain the compass\u2019 power.Tian Fei threw the talismans almost as soon as Chen Yu\u2019s words fell. The moment the yellow talismans touched the dark entity, they transformed into two blood-red sharp arrows, penetrating the evil spirit\u2019s protective screen straight through his back.\u201cAAA!\u201d The evil spirit screamed. He retracted the hands that were reaching towards Chen Yu and backed away several steps. He hesitantly glanced at Chen Yu, who had already stood up, and the miserable Tong Chao behind her, and suddenly turned into a cloud of dark energy before running away.Chen Yu retracted the compass floating in the air, and while sighing, she resolutely said in the direction of the evil spirit, \u201cDon\u2019t run if you have the ability, who am I, this exorcist Xishi, afraid of?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh at this time.\u201d Young Master Tong, who had just escaped from death, couldn\u2019t help but insert a snide remark.The onlookers nodded silently.Author\u2019s NOTE:Evil spirit: That burst of golden light was really strange, I almost succeeded several times.Wulao: Are you the guy who interrupted my comfortable massage and pedicure session?Xishi: You knew that I was in danger but you still continued doing pedicure?Wulao: Hahahaha\u2026 (flees at full speed)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: MiserableChen Yu walked to courtyard\u2019s entrance under the escort of seven big men.The door of the small courtyard was open, and Lou Ming was standing behind the door, looking at Chen Yu with worry.\u201cThird Brother.\u201d Chen Yu smiled and walked a few steps forward, stepping into the courtyard gate.Lou Ming looked at Chen Yu carefully. Her ponytail was scattered, her hair draped messily down her back, her clothes were stained with mud and grass, and her face was a bit dirty, but she seemed to be in a good state of mind nonetheless. When Lou Ming was just about to sigh a breath of relief, his eyes stopped suddenly at Chen Yu\u2019s feet. He immediately frowned. He strode over, bent down, and picked Chen Yu up horizontally.The big men around them were startled before they each looked up at the sky, pretending that they saw nothing.\u201c...\u201d The still frightened Tong Chao watched this scene speechlessly.\u00a0Does this group have problems in their brains? Their acting is too rigid ah.\u201cThird Brother?\u201d Chen Yu was suddenly picked up by Lou Ming; her whole face was stupefied.Lou Ming ignored Chen Yu. Instead, he took her into the house with large strides. When he put Chen Yu carefully on the sofa, someone immediately brought a medicine kit over.\u201cSome water and towels too,\u201d Tian Fei whispered to the person next to him.The brother who had just delivered the medicine kit immediately went and brought a basin of water and towels.\u201cWhere are your shoes?\u201d Lou Ming asked with a frown.Chen Yu hooked her dirty feet and explained, \u201cI came out in a hurry, didn\u2019t have time to change my shoes.\u201dLooking at the little girl\u2019s innocent expression, Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but sigh. He moistened the dry towel, wrung it out, and handed it to Chen Yu. \u201cWipe your face first.\u201dAfter hitting the ground several times, Chen Yu knew that her face must be dirty. She smiled embarrassedly, and took the towel to wipe it casually.Lou Ming rinsed the towel, wrung it out, and lifted Chen Yu\u2019s feet that were hanging down on the floor.Chen Yu was startled. She quickly retracted both of her feet, hid them under her butt, and said in panic, \u201cI\u2026 my feet are all right.\u201dLou Ming looked up and saw that the little girl was helpless and embarrassed. He went silent for a moment before handing the towel in his hand to Chen Yu and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve injured the sole of your foot. Wipe it clean first, I\u2019ll help you put on some medicine.\u201dChen Yu breathed a sigh of relief and took the towel to wipe her feet.\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d Chen Yu accidentally touched the wound on her sole. She couldn\u2019t help but inhale a mouthful of cold air.With a frown, Lou Ming reached out and directly pulled Chen Yu\u2019s injured foot, holding it in the palm of his hand to examine it carefully. The wound was about two to three centimeters long. Although there wasn\u2019t much blood, it was covered with sandy soil.Lou Ming took out an alcohol cotton ball from the medicine box beside him and said, \u201cI\u2019ll help you clean up your wound, it\u2019ll hurt a bit.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too troublesome ah, it will be fine after two days. When I was in the mountains, my feet were often cut by stones but they all healed by themselves,\u201d Chen Yu said indifferently.Lou Ming\u2019s gentle breath suddenly became cold. He silently looked at Chen Yu.Chen Yu didn\u2019t know why but she was suddenly persuaded. \u201cThat\u2026 won\u2019t it heal faster if it\u2019s cleaned up? Hahaha\u2026 then clean up, clean up ah.\u201dLou Ming\u2019s breath slowed down. He took the cotton ball to help Chen Yu clean her wound, but Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but twitch a little when the alcohol touched it. She secretly complained,\u00a0How can cleaning wounds hurt more than getting injured?\u201cMiss Chen Yu, please have something to eat.\u201d Don\u2019t know when Tian Fei brought out a lot of snacks and placed them in front of Chen Yu.Chen Yu immediately became overjoyed.\u00a0Finally, there\u2019s food to soothe this pain ah.\u201cThank you,\u201d Chen Yu smiled and said.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d After receiving Third Young Master\u2019s commending expression in his eyes, Tian Fei withdrew silently.Ding-a-ling\u2026A ringtone from her phone suddenly blared from the linen bag. Chen Yu had put her phone inside it during the fight before.She took out her phone and found Tong Wei was calling her, so she immediately answered it.\u201cI\u2019m here, is Tong Chao still safe?\u201d Tong Wei hurriedly asked before Chen Yu could say anything.\u201cHe\u2019s alright, although I\u2019m going to die soon.\u201d Thinking of how many talismans she had lost, Chen Yu felt that she was about to die from heartache.Lou Ming\u2019s hands that were cleaning her wounds stiffened. He raised his head and glanced at Chen Yu. After confirming that she was only complaining casually, he lowered his head and continued to clean.\u201cIt\u2019s good, it\u2019s good.\u201d Tong Wei breathed a sigh of relief when he heard that his nephew was alright.Is this person selectively deaf? How come he only listens to the first half sentence?After explaining the matter, Chen Yu hung up the phone and said to Lou Ming who was dressing up her wounds, \u201cThird Brother, I want to go out for a bit.\u201d\u201cGoing out for what?\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s face was full of disapproval.\u201cTong Chao\u2019s uncle\u2026\u201d Chen Yu finally realized at this time that Tong Chao didn\u2019t seem to be inside the house, and she looked around in surprise. \u201cWhere did Tong Chao go?\u201dLou Ming thought for a while and quickly guessed Tong Chao\u2019s identity. \u201cIs Tong Chao the male ghost during the day?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Chen Yu said. \u201cThat guy\u2019s probably blocked out of the yard. I\u2019m going to get him and search for his Second Uncle. It cost me so many talismans but I only charged him two million, what a big loss ah.\u201dHer heart felt distressed as she said this, and her face was full of pain.\u201cSo he\u2019s the one who provoked that thing tonight?\u201d Although Lou Ming couldn\u2019t see the black energy, it didn\u2019t prevent him from guessing.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I know Tong Chao\u2019s a big trouble so I won\u2019t bring him back.\u201d The more Chen Yu thought about it, the more annoyed she became,\u00a0but two million could make up for the loss anyways, Chen Yu thought as she prepared to get up from the sofa.\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Lou Ming held Chen Yu down, and he turned his head and said to Tian Fei, \u201cGo and bring the people in.\u201d\u201cThird Brother, it\u2019s better for me to go out,\u201d Chen Yu stopped him. \u201cTong Chao\u2019s Second Uncle is also a Celestial Master. You have such a strong aura, I\u2019m worried that you\u2019d get targeted.\u201d\u201cNo one dares to set their eyes here except you,\u201d Lou Ming said lightly.\u201cHow can it be the same? I just want to rub on the spiritual energy here, it won\u2019t hurt you, but others are different ah,\u201d Chen Yu said in a serious manner.After listening to Chen Yu\u2019s words, Lou Ming\u2019s calm face suddenly bloomed into a smile. He raised his hand and rubbed Chen Yu\u2019s hair. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it will only be at the courtyard\u2019s gate, I won\u2019t let him come inside.\u201d\u201cThird Brother, you haven\u2019t washed your hands yet.\u201d Chen Yu retracted her body back in disgust.Lou Ming stiffened, but he rubbed twice even more vigorously. \u201cIt\u2019s your own feet anyway.\u201dTian Fei knew that Chen Yu agreed to this, so he went out to get the people, but he was suddenly stopped by Chen Yu shouting from behind when he was walking to the door. \u201cAssistant Tian, my money, don\u2019t forget ah, my money, two million, he must pay me ah, otherwise I\u2019m gonna lose so much today.\u201d\u201cMiss Chen Yu, please be rest assured, I promise to complete the task.\u201d Tian Fei made a military salute to Chen Yu, then turned around and went out.After a while, Tian Fei led a black car over. When the car stopped at the entrance of the small courtyard, Tong Wei saw Tong Chao standing close by while looking inside the courtyard constantly. He immediately ran over with a smile, although his mouth was cursing, \u201cSmelly boy, where did you go these past few days?\u201d\u201cSecond Uncle?\u201d Tong Chao finally saw his Second Uncle. He rushed over in excitement to give him a hug, only to pass through his body.\u201cAre you stupid?\u201d Second Uncle Tong was disgusted.\u00a0This smelly boy had been floating for two weeks without realizing that he was a ghost.Tian Fei saw that Tong Wei was speaking into a mass of air. Although he couldn\u2019t see it, he understood that Tong Wei had already found his nephew, so he walked over and started asking money for Chen Yu. \u201cMr. Tong.\u201d\u201cAssistant Tian.\u201d Tong Wei immediately turned around and looked at Tian Fei politely.\u201cSince you have found the\u2026 soul that you\u2019re looking for, can you settle the bill?\u201d Tian Fei had lived for so many years, and it was the first time that he arrogantly asked for money. Furthermore, it was quite a big sum of money.\u00a0I have to say, this feeling is terribly good.Hearing about the bill, Tong Chao immediately remembered Chen Yu, so he said aloud, \u201cSecond Uncle, you ask how Chen Yu\u2019s condition was. She\u2019s the Celestial Master who called you before. She was injured just to protect me.\u201dTong Chao originally wanted to go in and see by himself, but he couldn\u2019t enter the perimeter for some reason, so he could only stay outside the gate.Upon hearing this, Tong Wei immediately asked Tian Fei, \u201cHow is Celestial Master Chen?\u201dTian Fei was dumbfounded for a while, only to realize that the other party was referring to Chen Yu, but this 'Celestial Master Chen' seemed inexplicably inconsistent with Miss Chen Yu's image.\u201cCelestial Master Chen is okay, just a little tired. That\u2019s why she entrusted me to settle the bill with you,\u201d Tian Fei replied with a smile.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll immediately transfer two million to Celestial Master Chen.\u201d Second Uncle Tong was wealthy, this little bit of money was nothing in his eyes.Tian Fei suddenly recalled how Chen Yu wailed that she was losing money, his eyes flashed brightly as he smiled and said, \u201cMr. Tong, the thing that came tonight was unexpectedly powerful. To protect your nephew\u2019s soul, our Celestial Master Chen used a lot of talismans, not to mention that she was injured.\u201dTong Wei was taken aback, he didn\u2019t react for quite a while.\u201cSecond Uncle, you transfer one million more, that girl suffered a lot in order to protect me.\u201d As the only bystander of the fierce battle just now, Tong Chao still felt a lingering fear.Hearing what his nephew said, Tong Wei immediately nodded his head in understanding. In fact, after he knew that the evil spirit who devoured souls had been here, Tong Wei felt that he might not see his nephew again. In the end, not only was his nephew alright, he was also very healthy. His soul wasn\u2019t weak at all, and he looked as if he just went out of his body. This was quite a big surprise ah.He was shocked just now not because of money, it was just that he was surprised how such a superb and high-level colleague would be so\u2026\u00a0cough\u2026 straightforward.\u201cThank you for Celestial Master Chen\u2019s care. I\u2019ll transfer one million more.\u201d As Tong Wei said this, he took out his phone and transferred an extra million to the account that Chen Yu had given him before.Tian Fei didn\u2019t think that his casual sentence would increase the income by another million. His heart was frightened and flabbergasted, although his face was still flat as a pancake.At this time, Chen Yu, who was eating to replenish her energy, heard her phone\u2019s prompt sound and immediately took it out to check.\u201cTwo million, one million, three million in total.\u201d Chen Yu looked with an incredulous expression. \u201cThey gave me an extra million.\u201d\u201cYou happy?\u201d Lou Ming teased.\u201cEn! In fact, I wanted to increase the price, but I was embarrassed to ask because the price was agreed upon in advance. But, they voluntarily gave me more, I\u2019m so happy ahhh~, ha ha ha\u2026\u201d Chen Yu smiled foolishly while holding her phone.Sure enough, a little money grubber.After Second Uncle Tong had confirmed his nephew\u2019s condition, he was about to turn around and leave when he heard a voice from the radio on Tian Fei\u2019s body. \u201cBrother Tian, the payment is confirmed.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Tian Fei replied to his teammate, and turned his head to meet Second Uncle Tong\u2019s complicated expression. He said with a smile, \u201cMr. Tong, you can leave with your nephew.\u201dWhat do you mean? I can\u2019t leave if I didn\u2019t transfer the money or the bank was delayed? Such a \u201csecular and down-to-earth\u201d Celestial Master.\u00a0Second Uncle Tong had lived for decades and this was the first time he had met someone like this.Tian Fei pretended that he couldn\u2019t understand the other\u2019s expression and made a polite \u201cthe exit is that way\u201d gesture with a smile on his face.Second Uncle Tong once again felt that it was his first time being pushed away like this since he became a Celestial Master. They didn\u2019t even let him inside. No\u2014they didn\u2019t even open the courtyard gate. Uncle Tong, who was inexplicably aggrieved, turned to his car. Tong Chao looked at the yard behind him hesitantly with a trace of worry, and followed his Second Uncle into the car.There was an unexpected one million more in her bank, Chen Yu laughed happily.Author\u2019s NOTE:In the assistant\u2019s dormitory, several assistants were discussing the matter just now.Chen Peng: Ha... self proclaiming herself as Xishi, such a blind confidence.Assistant A: It seems that there are only a few women in the Heavenly Master\u2019s circle.Assistant B: Say, just now, didn\u2019t Third Young Master carry Xishi like a groom carrying his bride?Cheng Peng: Where does she look like Xishi?Tian Fei came back from his shift while laughing stupidly: This grandpa\u2019s words worth thousands of gold ah...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Profound Strike TalismanLou Ming waited until Chen Yu had her fill before he asked about the matter just now.\u201cWhat did you fight in the small park?\u201d When he knew that something was clearly attacking the little girl but he couldn\u2019t even see what it was, he felt really horrible.\u201cHe should be an evil spirit.\u201d Chen Yu herself wasn\u2019t sure.\u201cShould?\u201d Lou Ming looked at Chen Yu strangely.\u201cEven I\u2019m not sure.\u201d She explained, \u201cI\u2019ve followed my grandpa to exorcise ghosts since I was eight. I have seen countless evil spirits and even two zombies, but this was the first time I saw something like that tonight. He looked like an evil spirit, but there are some things that are different.\u201d\u201cSome things are different? What\u2019s different?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cThe so-called evil spirits are actually the souls of people after their death. Because of resentment and entanglement with evil, they\u2019re unwilling to reincarnate and eventually stay in the human world. The reason why their strength increases is because of time, the depth of their resentment, or perhaps being contaminated by an evil aura or spirit. But they all have one common feature that will not change. That is, their ghostly state, which is what we often call lifeless spirit or Yin spirit.\u201d Chen Yu went on, \u201cBut the evil spirit today is very special. He has a very strong evil aura and he\u2019s in a soul state too, but he also carries vitality, the so-called vitality\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, only living people have vitality.\u201d Lou Ming expressed his understanding.\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s impossible for a ghost after death to have vitality, but this evil spirit not only has vitality, but it is very strong and thick, almost to the level of a normal human.\u201d Chen Yu continued, \u201cVitality is a very important sign for a Heavenly Master to judge a person\u2019s life and death, just like a doctor using heart beats to judge whether a person is alive or dead.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why he looks like neither a ghost nor a human in my eyes.\u201d Chen Yu was puzzled, \u201cIt\u2019s a species that I haven\u2019t seen before, and it\u2019s very powerful.\u201dLou Ming thought of Chen Yu\u2019s struggle during the previous fight and couldn\u2019t help but feel worry, \u201cThen, are you in danger?\u201d\u201cProbably not.\u201d Chen Yu said optimistically, \u201cHis goal seems to be Tong Chao, it has nothing to do with me.\u201d\u201cThen you don\u2019t have to deal with it anymore,\u201d Lou Min said after some thinking.\u201cOf course ah, I almost suffered a loss and was nearly reduced to poverty in order to earn 2 million yuan. I only have two talismans left in my bag ah, do you know how much its worth?\u201d When Chen Yu recalled this, her heart ached again. \u201cIf he comes to me again, just see if I don\u2019t make him compensate me.\u201dLou Ming was a little dumbfounded. After thinking some more, he then asked, \u201cYou said that you have seen zombies?\u201d\u201cYes ah, I remember that I told you this when we were in my school,\u201d Chen Yu reminded.Believe it or not, I already caught you!Lou Ming probably had the deepest impression of when they first met. He couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cI thought you were exaggerating deliberately to frighten me.\u201dAlthough the little girl looked fierce at the time, he knew that she was deliberately frightening him. It was obvious that it took her a lot of spiritual energy to finish drawing that one charm, but she boastfully said that it was easy.\u201cYou realized it?\u201d Chen Yu admitted with some embarrassment, \u201cI did deliberately scare you that time. When I saw your evil spirit at the opening ceremony, to be honest, if you really wanted to fight, I might have to find my grandpa. I can\u2019t beat you ah.\u201d\u201cYour grandfather\u2026 where is he now?\u201d Lou Ming asked with a stiff expression, as if he was asking carelessly.\u201cHe should be in Damu Village. I\u2019ll ask about you when I go back to see him during my winter vacation and see if there\u2019s any way to remove the evil spirit from you,\u201d Chen Yu said.Lou Ming looked at Chen Yu with a complicated expression. He didn\u2019t tell Chen Yu that her grandfather was no longer in the village, but the little girl\u2019s thought and care for him made his heart fuzzy and warm.\u201cI used to think that the old man was quite unreliable, but after I came out from there, I suddenly found out that he\u2019s actually powerful,\u201d Chen Yu said. \u201cHe used to tell me how powerful he was when he was young, and how experienced and knowledgeable he was. I thought that he was just bragging but looking at things now, it seems that it\u2019s true. That\u2019s why I think he has seen a situation like yours. After all, he has exorcised many zombies.\u201d\u201cWhat does my situation have to do with exorcising zombies?\u201d Lou Ming was puzzled.\u201cBecause your aura is similar to a zombie ah,\u201d Chen Yu said. \u201cWhen I was outside of the villa, I suddenly sensed that your evil spirit might be a zombie.\u201dIt was the first time for Lou Ming to hear this kind of evaluation. His mood became a little melancholic.\u00a0So my evil spirit is like a zombie? No wonder it hurts people.\u201cMy talismans ah, I originally had a bag full of talismans ah.\u201d Chen Yu saw that Lou Ming hadn\u2019t spoke, so she picked up her linen bag and began to check her little possessions. Although she already knew that there were only two talismans left, when she confirmed with her own eyes that there were indeed only two, she felt a burst of heartache again.Lou Ming returned to his senses and saw Chen Yu\u2019s appearance. He suddenly remembered the last two talismans he took out from the coffee table, and couldn\u2019t help ask, \u201cWhy did you put two talismans under the table?\u201dChen Yu\u2019s sad figure stiffened, then she suddenly stood up and said, \u201cUmm\u2026it\u2019s almost eleven o\u2019clock, I have to go back to bed, good night, Third Brother.\u201d After saying that, she began to limply walk towards the gate.This silly little girl!\u00a0Lou Ming didn\u2019t stop Chen Yu, but shouted a command to Tian Fei who was guarding outside, \u201cTian Fei, send Celestial Master Chen back.\u201d\u201cAffirmative!\u201d\u201cAfterwards find someone to search the house, see if our Celestial Master Chen put something like a talisman anywhere else.\u201d Lou Ming was about to go upstairs after he finished his words.Chen Yu\u2019s walking figure stiffened and it only took a second before she jumped back to Lou Ming\u2019s side, both of her hands clutched onto Lou Ming\u2019s arm, preventing him from leaving while speaking with a sad face, \u201cThird Brother, I was wrong, I shouldn\u2019t secretly use your evil spirit to research a new Expelling Talisman, I shouldn\u2019t secretly hide it from you because I want to monopolize exorcism money.\u201dLou Ming frowned, looking at the soles of the little girl\u2019s bandaged foot, a flash of worry flashed in his eyes.\u201cCan\u2026 can you not be angry? At worst, how about if I share 30% of the exorcism money?\u201d Seeing Lou Ming\u2019s frown, Chen Yu gritted her teeth and finally relented with heartache, \u201cThose two talismans played a big role for driving away that evil spirit tonight, I\u2019ll transfer 900 thousand yuan, I\u2019ll do it now.\u201dAs Chen Yu said this, she took out her phone, planning to transfer money to Lou Ming, \u201cBrother, what\u2019s your bank account number?\u201dLou Ming was speechless as he looked at Chen Yu. He reached out his hand to lift the little girl and put her back on the sofa. \u201cYour foot is injured, don\u2019t stand for a long time and don\u2019t walk too much.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Chen Yu was a little confused.\u201cYou said just now that you\u2019re using my evil spirit to study a new Expelling Talisman?\u201d Lou Ming sat down again and asked, \u201cSpecifically, what\u2019s it all about?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I just tell you that I\u2019ve seen two zombies?\u201d Chen Yu whispered.\u201cYou also said that my evil spirit is very similar to a zombie.\u201d Lou Ming naturally remembered their conversation just now.\u201cActually, when he used to catch zombies, that old man\u2026 that is, my grandpa, every time he caught zombies, he didn\u2019t kill them immediately. He tied them up and raised them instead.\u201d\u201cRaise?\u201d Lou Ming felt inexplicably uncomfortable with Wulao\u2019s taste.\u201cThis is because my grandpa wants to use the zombie\u2019s evil energy to make a Profound Strike Talisman.\u201d Chen Yu explained, \u201cAlthough zombies and evil spirit both comes from dead people, and that they both can accumulate Yin and evil energy, a zombie is a higher existence than an evil spirit. From a food chain perspective, zombies are the top existence inside the ghost world.\u201d\u201cDo you mean that zombies can kill evil spirits?\u201d Lou Ming understood a little but felt that some things need more explanation. \u201cBut didn\u2019t you say that the evil spirit within my body would enhance other evil spirit\u2019s power?\u201d\u201cThat also needs to be divided based on their strength ah, if the strength reaches a certain point, even evil spirits wouldn\u2019t dare to absorb it.\u201d Chen Yu explained, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, if you open that jade buckle and go outside, let alone people, even ghosts don\u2019t dare approach you. You\u2019re like a human nuclear power plant to ghosts. Our daily electricity use is only a small part of the electricity produced by a nuclear power plant. It can be regarded as beneficial if you only give a little to them, but if you give them an ultra-high voltage dose, would they still dare use it?\u201dChen Yu\u2019s explanation was simple and easy to understand so Lou Ming quickly got it. \u201cIn other words, if I walked out just now, that ghost-like thing would be afraid of me?\u201d\u201cYes ah,\u201d Chen Yu said, proud of herself. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see it, but he ran away as soon as I hit him with those two talismans, he\u2019s afraid of the evil spirit in your body.\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you let me go to help you just now?\u201d If Lou Ming had known that he could scare away the ghost, he would have long gone there to help.\u201cNo way, this is an urban area and there are many ordinary people,\u201d Chen Yu replied without thinking.Lou Ming was taken aback for a moment before showing a wry smile. He almost forgot that he was a harmful existence to both human and ghosts.\u201cThird Brother\u2026\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s tone suddenly became flattering.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Lou Ming asked suspiciously.\u201cYou see\u2026 I already explained about the Strike Talisman to you. Anyway, it can absorb the excess evil aura from your body, and then it can be used to deal with evil spirits through the spell transformation. In fact, it has no effect on you. Can you\u2026 can you let me continue drawing those Profound Strike Talismans ah?\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s hands tugged at Lou Ming\u2019s hem while her pair of big eyes blinked and blinked, shining like stars.\u201cYou want to learn from your grandpa and raise me as a zombie?\u201d Lou Ming raised his eyebrows.\u201cHow can it be\u2026you\u2019re not a zombie, you\u2019re my Third Brother\u2026\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s thick face shamelessly cottoned up to Lou Ming.Lou Ming\u2019s mood suddenly improved a lot. He deliberately teased the little money grubber, \u201cYou said that you\u2019ll give me 30% of the exorcism payment later?\u201d\u201cIf I use the Profound Killing Talisman, I\u2019ll give you 30%.\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s flesh felt like it was cut as she said this.That is to say, if she doesn\u2019t use it, then there\u2019s no need to divide the money.Actually, whether or not Chen Yu would give him the dividend, Lou Ming wouldn\u2019t stop her from making more Profound Strike Talismans. It was always better to have more protection for such a dangerous activity like exorcising ghosts. Also, it seemed like the only redeeming quality of his evil spirit was this point.\u201cDon\u2019t hide the talismans when you put them here later,\u201d Lou Ming said.Chen Yu\u2019s eyes lit up as she was pleasantly surprised. \u201cThird Brother, you agree? That\u2019s great! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll work hard to make money in the future and let you become a big tyrant along with me.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll depend on you.\u201d\u201cThen, Third Brother, can I also put a little in your bedroom so that the talisman can absorb evil energy when you\u2019re asleep? It\u2019s best to stick it on the bed which is the closest place to you. There\u2019s also the study room, I think you usually spend a lot of time there, how about I put a few too?\u201d Chen Yu had considered this possibility when she secretly put the two talismans under the coffee table, but she didn\u2019t dare to do it at the time. However, now that the two were in a cooperative relationship (dividing 30% of income to Third Brother), Third Brother won\u2019t refuse ah.\u201cWould you like to put a few on me too?\u201d Lou Ming was between laughter and tears.\u201cThat\u2019s good! A talisman on Third Brother\u2019s body would definitely accumulate the most energy. I\u2019ll keep it as my ace card.\u201d Chen Yu became more excited the more she talked about it. \u201cI\u2019ll draw a few more when I go back.\u201dReally knows how to reach for a yard after getting an inch!\u00a0Lou Ming could only shake his head helplessly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Living DeadWhen Chen Yu limped downstairs the next morning, it frightened her whole family.Mother Chen asked nervously, \u201cShishi, what happened to your feet?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t hop on one foot while wearing slippers, so she had to walk down slowly step by step while holding on the railing. \u201cWhen I went to the toilet last night, I accidentally broke my cup and stepped on the glass.\u201dTo make her lie more plausible, Chen Yu had reluctantly thrown the glass cup in her room.\u201cWhat? Your feet was pricked by glass, quick, let mom see it, aiya, don\u2019t go down the stairs, Chen Yang, go and help your sister down.\u201d Mother Chen shrieked, her voice even went up an octave.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d During Chen Yu\u2019s flurry of \u2018it\u2019s fine\u2019, Chen Eldest Brother already walked over and carried her from the stairs to the sofa.Chen Yu silently looked back on the remaining three steps down the stairs,\u00a0it really was unnecessary, really!\u201cLet me see if the injury is serious.\u201d Mother Chen bent down to look at her daughter\u2019s feet.\u201cIt\u2019s not serious, I already bandaged it.\u201d Chen Yu quickly took out her feet from her slippers, and presented them to the three anxious Chen family.Mother Chen saw that her daughter\u2019s feet had indeed been bandaged, at the same time, she also felt a burst of sadness as her tears started to fall.Chen Yang frowned, stepping \u00a0back with a flat expression.When Chen Yu saw her mother suddenly shed tears, she panicked and quickly comforted her, \u201cMom, mom, I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m really fine, it\u2019s just a small cut and there\u2019s no blood, it\u2019ll be fine after two days, don\u2019t cry ah.\u201d\u201cMy poor daughter.\u201d Mother Chen said with a grieving face, \u201cDid you also treat your injuries alone before? Shishi, you have to remember that you\u2019re at home now. You have dad and mom, there\u2019s also a brother who loves you, you have to tell us if you get hurt in the future, okay? Don\u2019t hide and treat your wounds silently, mother feels distressed looking at you like this.\u201dHow come I became someone who treats her wounds all alone? Why did it so sound heart-rending?Chen Yu looked at her elder brother for help, only to find him already hiding himself.Chen Yu turned her head to look at her father, only to find Mayor Chen covering himself with this morning\u2019s newspaper while stealing glances.They were obviously around her just a moment ago, how come they hid away in the blink of an eye?Indeed, it\u2019s better to help yourself than ask for help from others, Chen Yu could only use a pitiful tone to interrupt a grieving Mother Chen to divert her attention, \u201cMom, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201cHungry? Quickly have breakfast if you\u2019re hungry. You\u2019re injured, so we have to take care of you, I\u2019ll ask Aunt Liu to cook chicken soup for you at noon.\u201d As soon as Mother Chen heard that her daughter was hungry, she immediately stopped crying and walked quickly to the kitchen, \u201cI\u2019m going to tell Aunt Liu.\u201dAfter Mother Chen left, the three people in the living room all breathed a sigh of relief.Mayor Chen met his daughter\u2019s accusing eyes, folded the newspaper calmly and stood up, \u201cChen Yang, bring your sister to eat.\u201d After speaking, he walked towards the dining room rather hastily.Unable to capture Mayor Chen, Chen Yu had to interrogate her scoundrel brother, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you help just now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not me who made her cry.\u201d Chen Yang threw the pot directly back.Chen Yu grumbled for the rest of the day, but she still couldn\u2019t find any words to retort.Therefore, under Mother Chen\u2019s excessive concern, Chen Yu didn\u2019t go out during the next six days of vacation. She drank chicken soup everyday and waited until the wounds on her feet healed completely before Mother Chen finally agreed to let Chen Yu go back to school, otherwise she\u2019d ask for leave for her daughter ah.In this regard, Mother Chen said proudly, \u201cLook, you have to rest properly to get better sooner. Your wound healed in just a few days.\u201dThis is thanks to me nourishing it with spiritual energy every day, otherwise I don\u2019t know when I\u2019d be able to escape from your strict monitoring ah, Chen Yu\u2019s heartfelt thinking.However, because Chen Yu was locked inside the house with nothing to do, Chen Yu drew talismans every day, and although the Profound Strike Talisman was difficult to draw, nevertheless, she drew more than thirty in these six days of house arrest. On the last night that Chen Yu was at home, she slipped out to the Lou family\u2019s small courtyard and pasted the talismans tightly on Third Young Master\u2019s bed. As soon as the air conditioner was turned on, those talismans fluttered and swayed about, appalling Lou Ming.As such, Lou Ming\u2019s expression became very complicated. He said with a heavy sigh, \u201cI feel like a zombie right now.\u201d\u201cThird Brother, don\u2019t imagine them as talismans.\u201d Chen Yu suggested with good intention.\u201cThen, what should I imagine them to be?\u201d Lou Ming curiously asked.\u201cMoney ah, imagine that you\u2019re sleeping on a pile of banknotes, they sound just the same,\u201d when Chen Yu imagined this, she became excited.\u201c...\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s mouth twitched.\u201cPfftt\u2026\u201d He Qi at the side couldn\u2019t hold back.Lou Ming immediately raised his head and stared at him, He Qi quickly stopped smiling, not daring to squeak.\u201cDo the talismans have to be pasted one by one like this in order to be effective? Can\u2019t they be put aside inside a box?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cThey can ah, but don\u2019t you think that it looks better this way?\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s mind automatically converted these talismans into lovely pieces of money.The corner of Lou Ming\u2019s mouth twitched again. He ignored Chen Yu and said to He Qi, \u201cGo find a box to put these talismans in, put them under the bed.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d He Qi couldn\u2019t keep his face blank anymore and went to find a box while smiling.\u201cSo, you prefer to hide your money?\u201d Chen Yu looked like she had a realization.Lou Ming was too lazy to explain, as he covered his face with his hand, wondering how he had come this far. He, Lou Third Young Master, had lived for so many years, and the only thing that he never missed was money, alright? He couldn\u2019t care less to check the money given to him from the country that was piled up in the bank. It was only once in a while when he saw some place that was hit by natural disasters on TV that he remembered about his money for giving donations.Chen Yu\u2019s major was financial management. If one wanted to know why Chen Yu chose this major, it\u2019s actually very simple. Financial management ah, one look and you know that it\u2019s about managing money ah. Of course she will soon understand that the money she\u2019d manage has nothing to do with her personally, at least not the kind of relationship she imagined. [T/N: manage other\u2019 money, like in corporation]After finishing her classes for today, Chen Yu hugged her books and went to the dorm bedroom along with her roommates, en route, they talked about how Chen Yu became white.\u201cShishi, aren\u2019t you originally really white? If not, it would be impossible to become this white in such a short time.\u201d In just a week of not meeting each other, Chen Yu\u2019s skin became one full shade whiter, even if her mask was magical, it would be impossible to get this white, okay?Chen Yu recalled how Mother Chen\u2019s skin was fair and rosy, and nodded, \u201cI originally should be super white.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with \u2018super\u2019 white ah, white is white and black is black.\u201d Han You asked in wonder.\u201cI went to Qingmu Province all my childhood and often basked in the sun, that\u2019s why my skin became darker, but my mom\u2019s skin is super white.\u201d Chen Yu explained.\u201cSo it\u2019s like that ah, then it\u2019s no wonder.\u201d the realization suddenly dawned on the three people.\u201cBut, Shishi, with your skin white like this, perhaps you can really be called Xishi.\u201d Zhang Muwan said.\u201cAt that time, our room 518 definitely will turn into Imperial University\u2019s most famous beautiful women\u2019 room.\u201d Fang Feifei\u2019s imagination ran wild.The four of them laughed aloud, under the brilliant sunshine, walking on a small path lined lush trees, squandering their youth freely.Back in the dormitory, the four began to search for street food vendors around the school with their phones. They were taken to military training as soon as they arrived in school, so they hadn\u2019t tasted the various delicacies outside school.There\u2019s a food court outside of every school, that\u2019s an iron law that needs no proof.\u201cHow about hotpot? This shop has quite a good reputation.\u201d\u201cThis restaurant\u2019s skewers are also good, why not eat this one?\u201d\u201cThis one has crayfish, let\u2019s go eat crayfish ah.\u201dChen Yu took her phone and flipped through the various shops in the surrounding area displayed on the website. Honestly, she hadn\u2019t eaten many things so it was difficult to express her opinion, that\u2019s why she silently waited for others to make the decision.\u2018Ting-a-ling\u2019Chen Yu heard a prompt message from her phone and found that someone added her Penguin account. Chen Yu clicked it curiously, the moment she saw the name of the other party, her forehead immediately formed a deep frown.I\u2019m Big Account!Big Account, is it the old man? Nah, I shouldn\u2019t think much, I\u2019m gonna eat in a while.Chen Yu raised her hand and clicked it, the moment a dialog room between the two popped up, a message was sent from the other side.I\u2019m Big Account: (Girl, are you surprised?)I Want To Fix Road: (How can you go online?)I\u2019m Big Account: (Good, grandpa can feel your determination to build the road from your name, good luck ah, the people in Damu Village are relying on you.)Chen Yu rolled her eyes: (I want to ask you! Old man, since exorcising ghosts can earn much money, then why didn\u2019t you go and build Damu village\u2019s road all these years?)I\u2019m Big Account: (What did you ask me just now? Oh, why can I go online? Because grandpa is in at an internet cafe right now ah.)He changed the subject again, Chen Yu felt like she\u2019s almost half dead: (Why are you in an internet cafe?)I\u2019m Big Account: (A few days ago, I sensed you using a high level Defensive Talisman that I gave you and knew that you were in danger, so I especially found an internet cafe to ask about your situation. Well, you\u2019re not dead ah, I can put down my worries now.)\u2018Not dead\u2019, what the heck is this?I Want To Fix Road: (That was a week ago, you took so long just to ask me?)I\u2019m Big Account: (Grandpa also doesn\u2019t want it to be this long ah, but grandpa is already so old, it\u2019s really difficult to learn how to use the computer. You know, I learned it by myself for seven days inside this internet cafe.)Who are you lying to ah, can someone who has a Penguin account be unable to use a computer? Still saying learning how to use a computer for seven days? I bet you played for seven days.I\u2019m Big Account: (Ah, by the way, what kind of ghost did you meet that day? Why did you use the Advanced Defensive Talisman? Do you know how hard it is to draw one? This grandpa had to spend a lot of spiritual energy to produce three ah, use it sparingly.)Chen Yu saw that her old man was talking about that ghost, so she took the opportunity to ask: (Old man, is there some kind of ghost who obviously has strong evil and yin energy but also has a living person\u2019s vitality?)I\u2019m Big Account: (You met a Living Dead?)Chen Yu was stupefied: (Living Dead? What kind of thing is that?)I\u2019m Big Account: (There\u2019s a kind of black magic in the celestial world where one tries to resurrect the dead. They believe that as long as the dead are replenished with vitality, they will be able to come back to life again, that\u2019s why they invented this kind of black magic. Within a specific time frame, consecutively devouring 16 living person\u2019s souls that were born in Yin year, Yin month and Yin day, it can collect vitality bit by bit and come back to life.)Chen Yu felt like the matter was unthinkable: (Really?)I\u2019m Big Account: (Nonsense, of course it\u2019s a hoax, I\u2019ve taught you for so many years, have you ever seen a dead person resurrected?)Chen Yu endured her impulse to flare up and continued to ask: (Then, how do I deal with this kind of monster?)I\u2019m Big Account: (Haha\u2026 you can\u2019t win.)Chen Yu gritted her teeth and typed a few words: (Do you still want me to build the road?)I\u2019m Big Account: (Alright, considering Damu Village\u2019s elder and fellow villagers\u2019 faces, I\u2019ll teach you how. Wait tonight until I sort everything out, I\u2019ll send the method to your mailbox.)Wulao went offline after sending this sentence.Chen Yu really wished that she could drill right through her phone and drag that old man over.\u00a0He knew how to send emails but still dared say that he can\u2019t use a computer?At the other side, Wulao closed the messaging system, turned his head and pressed the service bell while shouting, \u201cManager, cook me an instant noodle, I\u2019m downloading a copy ah.\u201dAfter a while, the manager came over with a bowl of instant noodle, he was really impressed with this strange old man who played games in this internet cafe for a whole seven days, \u201cAiya, Mr. Lao, your skill is really good ah.\u201d\u201cStill okay, in fact, my best occupation is Assassin, I only played with this Taoist Priest character for a day, still not quite familiar ah.\u201d Wulao said modestly, \u201cI\u2019ll download a copy for you another day.\u201dAuthor\u2019s NOTE:Wulao: I haven\u2019t been outside the mountains for more than ten years and the games had developed so amazingly, so fun\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: National Spiritual WebsiteAfter dinner, Chen Yu looked at the small street lined pack with food vendors and realized the importance of making money again. There are so many delicious foods in a small street while the world is so big, how can one eat them all without money?\u201cTomorrow we\u2019ll try another vendor to eat.\u201d Chen Yu said excitedly.\u201cRight, we\u2019ll eat at a different vendor every day and it won\u2019t take long to eat this street whole.\u201d The round-faced Fang Feifei expressed her agreement with Chen Yu\u2019s statement.\u201cWe better not do this frequently.\u201d Han You said, holding her bulging belly, \u201cEating like this every day will definitely make us fat.\u201d\u201cBetween good food and beauty, I think I still choose beauty.\u201d Zhang Muwan said.\u201cDon\u2019t ever tell me that you guys are foodies anymore, you two are counterfeit foodies.\u201d Fang Feifei approached Chen Yu, took her hand and said affectionately, \u201cShishi, we\u2019ll eat together in the future, I\u2019m not afraid of getting fat for delicious food.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Chen Yu was naturally happy when she could go and eat good food together in the future.\u201cLook, those who aren\u2019t afraid of getting fat like us are qualified foodies.\u201d Fang Feifei said proudly.\u201cNo way.\u201d Chen Yu blinked innocently and asked with a serious face, \u201cI can\u2019t get fat, will I be unqualified because I can\u2019t get fat?\u201dChen Yu who came in contact with the term \u2018foodie\u2019 for the first time, expressed that she didn\u2019t really get the meaning.The lively atmosphere became silent for a while before exaggerated laughter sounded suddenly. Fang Feifei threw away Chen Yu\u2019s arm angrily, Han You and Zhang Muwan stood on the road and laughed out loud, not caring about their image.After returning to their room, Chen Yu coaxed Fang Feifei who got her heart injured. The few people chatted for a while and then went to sleep. After lowering the curtain, Chen Yu took her phone and checked her mailbox, only to find that the email that old man promised still hadn\u2019t been sent until now. Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help feeling a little gloomy,\u00a0that old man couldn\u2019t have forgotten about this matter, right?Today the old man went online so suddenly, but he also went offline just as sudden as he came. In this brief time, Chen Yu couldn\u2019t ask him many things. After thinking about it, Chen Yu logged in to her account and planned to leave a few words for the old man.As soon as she logged in, the group \u2018Gods and Ghosts Don\u2019t Ask\u2019 icon kept on flashing but Chen Yu didn\u2019t rush to check it. She first clicked on the old man\u2019s dialogue box and sent a series of messages over: (Old man, this is my phone number, you can buy a phone when you have time and send me the number back so that we can get in touch easily. If the money isn\u2019t enough, send me an account number and I\u2019ll send the money to you.)Actually, Chen Yu didn\u2019t plan to add the last sentence, how can the old man lack money with his skill? But when she thought about their simple 15 years of life in Damu Village, Chen Yu still added this sentence. Although she didn\u2019t know the reason, but Chen Yu felt that the old man planned to not make money from exorcism anymore.Chen Yu waited but the other party didn\u2019t reply to her message for quite a long time, it seems like he\u2019s really offline. After some time, Chen Yu then decided to click on the flashing group chat.(Someone in the group issued a red envelope!)Seeing this prompt, Chen Yu\u2019s eyes lit up. She raised her finger and quickly grabbed a red envelope, opened it and found that it was one hundred yuan, so happy ah!March Floating Rain: (Hahaha~)Cassia Seed: (Brother March, you look so happy today you even gave out 3 consecutive red envelopes ah.)What? I actually missed two?\u00a0Chen Yu swished the messages up and found the two red envelopes that had been robbed, she was immediately struck with frustration.March Floatin Rain: (My cousin, he was injured by a ghost, hahaha~)Wine and Meat Monk: (Amituofu, benefactor, we\u2019re at a legal society now, please repent before the evil thoughts in your heart grow beyond control. We must strive to be good citizens who abide by the law.)Gold Thread Child: (Hey, fake monk, are you here to be funny? We\u2019re a group of tax-evading heavenly masters, we basically aren\u2019t law-abiding.)Wine and Meat Monk: (Amituofu, the two natures are completely different. Tax evasion is nothing but money, however, my dear friend above, if this continues to develop, it\u2019ll be destructive to social stability.)March Floating Rain: (I\u2019m laughing about how it\u2019d affect social stability, do you know that tax evasion warrants jail time outside?!)A group of tax evaders? Tax evasion? Am I a tax evader? Will I go to jail for tax evasion?After receiving the latest information, Chen Yu became sluggish. She took her phone and searched the internet. After a few clicks, she found several business bosses who were caught for tax evasion, with some serious cases involving jail, and this made Chen Yu terribly scared.Mayor Chen, I\u2019m sorry, your daughter is a tax evader. Brother Chen, I\u2019m sorry, your sister is a tax evader. Can you two still keep your official post?Chen Yu who was taken by surprise that she broke the law, quickly opened Lou Ming\u2019s WeChat and sent a crying emoji.Lou Ming quickly replied: (What happened?)Chen Yu: (Third Brother, do you know how to make up tax payment?)Lou Ming: (Make up tax payment? Who\u2019s evading taxes?)Chen Yu: Me. (Little man emoji crying on the ground)Lou Ming: \u2026Lou Ming: (What\u2019s wrong?)Chen Yu grieved and typed with a sad face: (I just now knew that making money as a Heavenly Master has to pay taxes, but I have made millions without paying a cent of tax, will I have to pay a lot of money? I searched the internet, they said that I can go to jail if the amount of money is particularly huge.)Lou Ming was sitting on the second floor\u2019s study room, he looked at his phone with a helpless expression. He stared at her message, and he suddenly burst out laughing.It was as if the little girl\u2019s slumping body and sad face was right in front of Lou MIng\u2019s eyes. Lou Ming typed a few words with a hint of smile on his face: (There\u2019s me, you won\u2019t go to jail.)After sending this sentence, Lou Ming closed the chat room with Chen Yu and clicked on Master Mao\u2019s WeChat. He hesitated for a moment and decided to ask directly: (Master Mao? Does your spiritual job also need to pay taxes?)Master Mao: (Taxes? I don\u2019t really recall that I\u2019ve paid any taxes, why do you suddenly ask this?)Lou Ming: (Nothing? I suddenly felt that your circle\u2019s job often sold a single talisman for hundreds of thousands, it can be regarded as a high-income job. I\u2019m studying tax law recently so I\u2019m a little curious.)Master Mao: (So it\u2019s the case. Our spiritual circles haven\u2019t been asked for taxes specifically. At least neither I nor my apprentice.)Lou Ming: (Understood, sorry for disturbing you Master.)Master Mao: (It\u2019s nothing. Lou Ming ah, your hobbies are getting wider and wider.)Lou Ming chatted a few more words with Master Mao before switching back to the chat room with Chen Yu: (I asked just now, spiritual jobs don\u2019t need to pay taxes, as such, there\u2019s no tax evasion, you must have heard it wrong.)Chen Yu suddenly widened her eyes: (Really?)Lou Ming: (Really!)Who\u2019s Lou Ming? Although she didn\u2019t know exactly what his job was, but special forces stationed at his yard and even her mayor dad has to be respectful towards him, his status definitely wasn\u2019t low. If he said that she didn\u2019t need to pay taxes then it must be true oh!Chen Yu finally felt relieved, she went back to the group and continued to read the comments. At this time, the content had changed to another topic.Cassia Seed: (It seems that many Celestial Masters have been injured recently.)Taoist Priest Feng Huo: (That\u2019s right ah, I heard that it has something to do with the recent living soul incident.)March Floating Rain: (Right, right, I eavesdropped on my grandpa and cousin\u2019s talk a few days ago, they said that it was a monster that devours souls. It seemed that that monster failed to eat the last soul, so it went around everywhere.)Wine and Meat Monk: (The last living soul? How many souls does this monster need to consume? What will it change into after it swallows the last soul?)March Floating Rain: (I don\u2019t know ah, my cultivation level is the worst in my family so my grandpa won\u2019t tell me this, but this monster seems to be quite powerful. My grandpa is thinking about taking the matter personally, however, this old man hasn\u2019t personally taken a job for so many years already.)Taoist Priest Feng Huo: (I heard the soul that this monster wants to eat must be one that was born in Yin year, Yin month and Yin day. Yesterday, Liang family\u2019s most talented young Heavenly Master, Liang Guang, was injured because he protected one.)March Floating Rain: (Hahahaha, injured.)Wine and Meat Monk: (Benefactor, why is your hostility so heavy? Although we all are avoiding taxes reasonably, we must respect those who pay taxes in accordance with the law.)Gold Thread Child: (A new mission has just been released on the website. Reward: five million, tax-free.)Cassia Seed: (Only five million for something that Liang Guang can\u2019t beat? It isn\u2019t worth it even with the tax exemption.)Gold Thread Child: (The mission is to protect a human\u2019s soul, not to kill the target.)Didn\u2019t Third Brother say that there\u2019s no need to pay taxes? Why is the group talking about taxes again?\u00a0Chen Yu was a little confused, she couldn\u2019t help poking her only friend in the group, March Floating Rain: (What does it mean to pay taxes? Isn't the money made by Heavenly Masters exempt from taxes?)March Floating Rain: (What?)I Want To Fix Road: (Didn\u2019t you just say that we\u2019re a group of tax evaders? And that there\u2019s a reasonable tax avoidance?)March Floating Rain:(Oh, haha, you\u2019re talking about that ah. Actually, what we really meant when we\u2019re talking about tax evasion wasn\u2019t evading taxation but reasonably evading service charge.)I Want To Fix Road: (Service charge?)March Floating Rain: (It\u2019s the service fee paid when receiving tasks from the National Spiritual website.)I Want To Fix Road: (National Spiritual website?)March Floating Rain: (Great god, surely you wouldn\u2019t not know about that right? National Spiritual website ah, the website that regularly issues various tasks ah, the spiritual website that our country specially established ah.)I Want To Fix Road: (I don\u2019t know!)March Floating Rain: \u2026March Floating Rain: (National Spiritual website, a website dedicated to publishing supernatural events across the country. They usually handle spiritual matters. The price is fair and honest, any Heavenly Masters can take a task from there, but they have to hand in 30% of service charge.)I Want To Fix Road: (30%? Such a high fee?)March Floating Rain: (Yeah, you also think that\u2019s really high, right? It\u2019s very dangerous for us Heavenly Masters to exorcise ghosts, if you exorcise one with a century cultivation level you can also earn a million, of which hundreds of thousands will be spent on buying talismans. It looks like we\u2019re making lots of money, but it\u2019s actually not that much. It\u2019s simply crazy that they actually make us pay 30%.)March Floating Rain: (Because this service charge is collected by the state, we jokingly call it \u2018tax\u2019 in our spiritual circle.)Chen Yu thought for a while and wondered: (Then, since the service charge is so expensive, shouldn\u2019t it be okay if we don\u2019t pick them up? Why do we say that our group is a tax evasion group?)March Floating Rain: (Where would there be so many tasks that come in private ah? Do you think that you can just meet evil spirits while walking leisurely on the street ah? People nowadays are so smart, you will be called a swindler if you do fortune telling under the bridge. Therefore, most Heavenly Masters receive tasks from the National Spiritual website. But the service charge is too expensive, many Heavenly Masters that finished tasks had to suffer losses after handing in service charge, that\u2019s why we established this group.)I Want To Fix Road: (How?)March Floating Rain: (You also don\u2019t know this? To put it simply, you just go to the website to find a suitable task, send the content of the task to the group owner, the group owner charges a 5% fee to help us find out the client\u2019s contact information, then we just contact the client directly.)I Want To Fix Road: \u2026March Floating Rain: (This is a win-win situation ah, the group owner earns 5% of service charge so the Heavenly Master pays 25% less while the client can also buy the same service at a lower price. This is the price difference without a middleman!)I Want To Fix Road: \u2026March Floating Rain: (However, great god, how come you don\u2019t know anything? How did you enter this group?)I Want To Fix Road: (This account was given to me by another person.)March Floating Rain: (No wonder then.)After talking with March Floating Rain, Chen Yu became very interested in the so-called National Spiritual website so she entered the web page. She was about to study the website carefully when a system notification sounded all of a sudden.\u2018Ting-a-ling.\u2019Chen Yu looked up and found the old man\u2019s account was flashing, her finger immediately clicked on it.I\u2019m Big Account: (My account is: 622222****** Account name: Wuli.)I\u2019m Big Account: (Email has been sent, remember to study it carefully, if something goes wrong, grandpa won\u2019t be able to save you in time.)Chen Yu immediately started talking about the latest information she got: (Old man, I have something that I want to ask.)Chen Yu waited for a long time without receiving a reply, after a closer look, she discovered that the old man was offline again.He dares to go offline a second after sending a message, what the heck?Chen Yu was about to fume but she was helpless. She will just call the old man after he buy a phone, thinking like this, Chen Yu used her phone to transfer one hundred thousand yuan to the old man\u2019s account.After the transfer, Chen Yu clicked on the email from her grandpa, the document was sent two minutes ago. When Chen Yu opened it, there were several photos inside. The photos were taken from an old notebook, a yellowed paper recorded some methods and tactics on exorcising ghosts.These photos were clearly taken with a phone, Chen Yu\u2019s stomach was stuffed with regrets because she sent money too early.Author\u2019s NOTE:Wulao: Manager, come, teach me how to use e-money ah, I don\u2019t know how to pay money in game.Manager: Old man, how many do you want to deposit?Wulao: Ten thousand first.Manager: \u2026Wulao: My granddaughter just sent me 100 thousand, letting me play games ah.Manager: \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Going BackChen Yu first spent a few hours studying the notes from her grandpa, and then, unable to contain her curiosity, she continued to study the spiritual website for another several hours.After that, Chen Yu couldn\u2019t sleep because of her excitement. She was still worried before, although it\u2019s very profitable to exorcise ghosts, it\u2019s not every day that people in this group post any tasks, and it\u2019s not like she can meet with an unlucky ghost like Tong Chao every day when she walks on the street. No, let\u2019s forget about Tong Chao, she was the unlucky one for meeting him.Aside from exorcising, although her talismans are also profitable, she met people who begged to buy talismans from her outside this group sometime ago and thought that it wouldn\u2019t be hard to sell them. However, it took a few days to realize that people would only buy it outside when they\u2019re in a hurry, usually, they would draw talismans themselves at home ah.Chen Yu understood this point very well, for example, if you ask her to buy other people\u2019s talisman, if it wasn\u2019t someone forcing her, she would be brain damaged to buy it.As for the Taobao store that she opened two days ago, after she put a few Expelling Talismans and Calming Spirit Talismans to sell, no one came to buy them. Chen Yu didn\u2019t have any hope, so she just left it like that. Fortunately, Taobao didn\u2019t need store fees, or else she would die from the fees.Although she didn\u2019t know how much she\u2019d need to build a road, but it definitely wasn\u2019t any less than 100 million yuan. That small amount of money she accumulated in the bank was really not enough.Chen Yu was wondering how to make more money these days, and suddenly she discovered this thing called the National Spiritual website. This thing, if she didn\u2019t see it herself, she would be in the dark forever. She was shocked once she entered the website, the densely packed supernatural missions had all turned into a wave of bank figures, making Chen Yu\u2019s eyes shone brightly.Although the service charge was a bit expensive, isn\u2019t there still the group owner? Chen Yu has been in the group for more than a month, and finally she now realized the true essence of this group - Saving Money.As a result of her excessive excitement, student Xishi who woke up the earliest in room 518 the next day, slept soundly until lunch time.After eating lunch brought back from the cafeteria by her roommates, Chen Yu rubbed her drowsy eyes and opened them only in the afternoon. At last, she was completely awake, as for what was said in class, at any rate, the lessons weren\u2019t anything profound from the beginning of the school, she can just do some self-study later.After class, Chen Yu and her roommates were walking together, discussing where they should eat today. When they looked up, they saw a large circle of female students under the stairs of the classroom building.\u201cThat\u2019s the owner of VK.\u201d\u201cI like their clothes the most, buy new styles for every season.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Tong has good appearance and taste ah.\u201d\u201cTheir brand\u2019s colour combinations are really dope, this is the first time I see a man wearing so many colors like that but still looks so good.\u201d\u201cI heard that all men inside fashion industry are gay.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense, Young Master Tong changes girlfriend every season ah.\u201d\u201cWhat am I gonna do? I bought this clothing from brand A, would he realize it?\u201d\u2026After hearing those female students chatting fervently, Han You and Fang Feifei quickly guessed who was in the center of that circle, they suddenly dragged Chen Yu and Zhang Muwan excitedly to join the crowd of onlookers.\u201cInside is Young Master Tong ah, my male god, my male god who knows female beauty the best.\u201d Fang Feifei rushed inside while explaining to Chen Yu, \u201cI only wear their brand\u2019s clothes.\u201dLiar, does school uniform don\u2019t count?\u201cAAAA~ I also love him ah, he\u2019s so HANDSOME!\u201d Han You\u2019s face was full of excitement.Chen Yu was bumped left and right inside the frenzied crowd with endless sorrow in her heart.\u00a0What are you guys doing, dragging me along when you guys want to see your male god ah? I don\u2019t even know that kid ah.\u00a0Although Chen Yu was reluctant in every possible way, but driven by instinct, she actually let Fang Feifei bring her to the front.\u201cMale god, male god!\u201d Fang Feifei crazily waved at the man casually leaning against a car.Chen Yu followed and looked over, she suddenly had an inexplicable feeling that the man who was wearing sunglasses and putting on an act not far from her was a bit familiar.Tong Chao turned his head slowly, planning to give his enthusiastic charming smile towards his fans and unexpectedly saw the person he had been waiting for. Tong Chao smiled triumphantly, took off his sunglasses, casually hung it on his collar, and walked towards Chen Yu under loud screams and cheers.Second Uncle was afraid that the other party wouldn\u2019t agree, after all this Heavenly Master Chen didn\u2019t look like a fan of his. Although he didn\u2019t have the memory from when he was in his living soul state, but he wanted to ask, which woman could resist his charm? Even if she could resist him, surely she won\u2019t be able to resist the clothes he designed. Tong Chao strutted forward confidently.\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t remember you anymore, but you definitely remember me.\u201d Tong Chao blinked ambiguously at Chen Yu.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Chen Yu asked with a blank face.\u201c...\u201d The cool posture that Tong Chao just posed almost collapsed.\u201cShishi, don\u2019t you know him? Tong Chao, the most famous clothing designer in China, his designs are super beautiful.\u201d Fang Feifei immediately helped explain to Chen Yu.Tong Chao nodded in relief,\u00a0finally, there\u2019s someone who knows what\u2019s good, he couldn\u2019t help but send a spark towards Fang Feifei.Fang Feifei\u2019s whole face flushed crimson red immediately.\u201cNever noticed before!\u201d Chen Yu shrugged her shoulders.Did I find the wrong person?\u00a0Fascinated and confident with his charm, Tong Chao took out his phone and searched for Chen Yu\u2019s photo. After a careful look, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not wrong ah, although she\u2019s a bit more white than in the photo, but it\u2019s still the same person ah.\u201d\u201cLittle girl, is your name Chen Yu?\u201d Tong Chao asked.\u201cDo you know our Xishi?\u201d Chen Yu hadn\u2019t answered, but Fang Feifei on her side already helped verify her identity.\u201cIt really is you.\u201d After confirming her identity, Tong Chao stretched his hand and pulled Chen Yu out of the crowd, \u201cLittle girl, follow me.\u201dThe scoundrel who made me lose so many talismans, still dares provoke me?\u00a0With this new hatred added on the old hatred, Chen Yu ruthlessly stepped on his foot. Young Master Tong wailed painfully at once, crouched down and covered his aching foot.\u201cFS brand shoes, this pair costs hundreds of thousands.\u201d Some girl from inside the crowd quoted the price.Hundreds of thousands?\u00a0Chen Yu walked over and stepped on the other one.\u201cAH! What are you doing?!\u201d Tong Chao raised his head angrily.\u201cYou dare try and bother me again?\u201d Chen Yu finished speaking and took Fang Feifei to meet up with their two other roommates before turning and left.\u201cStop there for me!\u201dWhere would Chen Yu care about him? She left with her roommates without looking back.At a restaurant outside of campus, the three girls all lost the thoughts of eating and kept staring at Chen Yu who was cheerfully eating by herself. After Chen Yu finished her meal, she raised her head and met three pairs of burning eyes staring at her, she immediately burped in shock.\u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d Chen Yu took the cup next to her and gulped a mouthful down her throat.\u201cSpeak, how do you know Young Master Tong?\u201d Fang Feifei asked first.\u201cGirl, hear me!\u201d Han You asked with a shady expression, \u201cDo you know who was taken out by him last time? The International Supermodel Lu Weiwei!\u201d[EN: Reference to W\u0113i W\u0113i Y\u012b Xi\u00e0o H\u011bn Q\u012bng Ch\u00e9ng ? / Love O2O]\u201cShe\u2019s also his fifteenth girlfriend.\u201d Zhang Muwan said.\u201cYou guys are stupid, it\u2019s obvious that Young Master Tong knew Shishi, that\u2019s why he called out Shishi\u2019s name.\u201d Fang Feifei said.\u201cWe didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d Zhang Muwan and Han You were still behind the crowd at the time, they weren\u2019t able to squeeze in.\u201cSpeak, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Fang Feifei asked, her face was filled with curiosity.What else is going on? That guy owes me money, but of course Chen Yu can\u2019t say that. She thought a bit before answering, \u201cI just ran into him when I was out shopping for clothes.\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cThen I said that the clothes inside were really ugly and none of them were suitable for me. As a result, this man became crazy, he pulled me and told me that he wanted to design clothes for me.\u201d Chen Yu explained with half-truth and half-sham, anyway, Tong Chao was a fashion designer, it\u2019s more convincing to tell a story like this than telling them that she met Tong Chao\u2019s ghost.\u201cThen you must have entered VK\u2019s store.\u201d\u201cYou actually said that the clothes weren\u2019t good looking right in front of the designer, no wonder he\u2019s looking for you.\u201d\u201cBut, isn\u2019t it good this way? Young Master Tong will personally design clothes for you ah.\u201d\u201cTheir clothes are so expensive, no way I can buy them.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d For Young Master Tong to take the matter personally, the price would be so high that ordinary college students like them can\u2019t even imagine to afford even a piece.The three of them accepted Chen Yu\u2019s explanation, and their meals were almost all eaten up so they got up and wanted to settle the bill. When they arrived at the counter, the cashier said that someone had already paid for them.\u201cWho?\u201d Han You asked.\u201cThe gentleman who paid the bill said that he\u2019s waiting for you all outside the door.\u201d The cashier said.The four of them walked out from the restaurant with some doubts, although the days in summer were longer, but it had passed the dinner time and the sky had become darker. Across the road, a luxury car was quietly parked on the side of the road. Although Tong Chao wasn\u2019t standing flashily outside the car, but seeing this car that made a commotion just now, they could naturally guess who was inside.\u201cSo it\u2019s Young Master Tong.\u201dChen Yu frowned, she said in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t bother, let\u2019s go.\u201dJust when they turned around and took two steps forward, they saw a man in black suit blocking their way, \u201cMiss Chen, please take some time to speak a few words.\u201dChen Yu saw a faint spiritual power from the other party and knew that he was from spiritual circle too. After two seconds of contemplation, Chen Yu followed him to one side.Sitting in the car, Tong Chao who saw this scene couldn\u2019t help but raise his eyebrows.\u00a0Ain\u2019t I more handsome than that Jiang Hui with a square face?\u201cCelestial Master Chen, it\u2019ll be dark soon.\u201d said Jiang Hui.\u201cThen?\u201d Chen Yu asked, not understanding his meaning.\u201cThat thing will come after Young Master Tong after dark.\u201d Jiang Hui said, \u201cDuring this time, my master has been seriously injured in order to protect Young Master Tong.\u201dChen Yu immediately understood, it turned out that the living dead hadn\u2019t given up on this unlucky Tong Chao.\u201cIsn\u2019t it just devouring the living soul? You just have to prevent his soul from being stolen then.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cThe moment after death, a soul will still have vitality.\u201d Jiang Hui reminded her. [T/N: I\u2019m not really sure what this means]Chen Yu\u2019s expression instantly became grave,\u00a0this thing has to be immediately killed, no matter what.\u201cSometime ago, Young Master Tong was saved by Celestial Master Chen, but it was unknown why that monster always had his eyes on Young Master Tong.\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s because your family\u2019s Young Master Tong\u2019s birth is too good.\u201d There weren\u2019t many people who have spiritual power in their soul that were also born on a Yin date.\u201cWhat?\u201d Jiang Hui didn\u2019t understand.\u201cNothing, continue, why did you search for me?\u201d Chen Yu asked.Jiang Hui said, \u201cThat monster is really dangerous, Celestial Master Chen, you\u2019ve seen it already, if it really swallows Young Master Tong and transforms into something else, no one can deal with the consequences.\u201dIn Chen Yu\u2019s mind, the notes she had read last night immediately appeared: (Living Dead, also known as Living Zombie, is different from ordinary zombies in that they retain human intelligence along with their brutal nature. And every time they swallow a living soul, their power will also be significantly enhanced.)Chen Yu hesitated for a bit before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t really have a way to help right now, my magic weapons and talismans are basically all used up already.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Jiang Hui immediately said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t hesitate to mention any magic weapons and talismans that you need, master has prepared a 10 million yuan budget to purchase them, we can also add more if it\u2019s not enough.\u201dWhen he picked up Young Master Tong from Master Chen that day, Old Master discovered that Master Chen loves money.Ten million???!Chen Yu was so shocked that she staggered.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Celestial Master Chen?\u201d Jiang Hui asked with concern.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I just stepped on a pebble and tripped a bit.\u201d Chen Yu forced herself to calm down and said, \u201cThen, will you buy me what I need or should I buy it myself?\u201d\u201cBoth ways are okay.\u201d Jiang Hui said.Chen Yu lowered her head in thought, actually trying to suppress her excitement,\u00a0ten million, ten million\u2026\u201cIn addition, if Celestial Master Chen\u2019s willing to help, we will also prepare a labor cost of another ten million yuan.\u201d Jiang Hui continued to wheedle her.\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Chen Yu said in a righteous manner, \u201cIf this monster succeeds, wouldn\u2019t it be a disaster for the world?\u201d\u201cCelestial Master Chen is righteous.\u201d\u201cSend me the money first, I have to buy some magic weapons and talismans.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cMay I ask what magic weapons and talismans that Celestial Master Chen needs? I have brought some with me\u2026\u201d\u201cThe one I want to buy is specially designed and different from yours.\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cMy method is different, thus the talismans used are different too.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.

    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: Goodbye ZombieChen Yu who bent her back for the twenty million hard cash, went back to her roommate\u2019s side with a face full of joy as she planned to explain her reason for leaving.\u201cYou guys, go ahead, I need to leave to do something. I\u2019ll get back tonight to sleep and go to class with you guys tomorrow morning.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cWhat are you going for? What did that person say to you just now?\u201d All of them knew that Chen Yu\u2019s house wasn\u2019t far from school, so it\u2019s not strange for her to go back sometimes, but once they saw Chen Yu\u2019s jovial expression, they immediately knew that something good must have happened.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say before? That Young Master Tong wants to match clothes for me.\u201d An excitement seeped into Chen Yu\u2019s tone, \u201cHe said that he would give me his clothes for free as long as I agree to model for him in order to prove that his clothes are top-notch.\u201dTwenty million ah, make up for losses, make up for losses, aaaaa~~\u201cReally? Can we go together to see?\u201d These teenage girls were right at the age of loving beautiful things, and it\u2019s very hard to see a great master at fashion design doing his work personally.\u201cI\u2019m afraid you guys can\u2019t.\u201d Chen Yu said with difficulty.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Young Master Tong must have wanted to bring you to his personal studio, of course outsiders are prohibited from entering.\u201d Han You explained.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we can just see the clothes when Chen Yu returns back tomorrow.\u201d Zhang Muwan consoled.\u201cRight, right, right, Shishi, you\u2019re really gonna change into a real Xishi ah.\u201d Fang Feifei excitedly said.\u201cI\u2019m originally Xishi ah.\u201d Chen Yu disapproved.\u201cTsk!\u201d All three of them gave Chen Yu big eye rolls.After giving her roommates an explanation, Chen Yu waved her hands before sitting down inside the parked car.When seeing Tong Chao once more, Chen Yu felt that he looked much more pleasing to her eyes all of a sudden, so strange ya~\u201cAre you really a Heavenly Master?\u201d Tong Chao couldn\u2019t help but ask Chen Yu at his side.\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu answered with a hum, then raised her head to ask Jiang Hui at the driver\u2019s seat, \u201cThat\u2026 where will we go? Is there any particular address?\u201d\u201cHeavenly Master Chen, the address we\u2019re going to is Young Master Tong\u2019s private residence at Golden River Road number 388.\u201d Jiang Hui replied.\u201cOh.\u201d After getting the address, Chen Yu lowered her head to open Lou Ming\u2019s Wechat and sent a message: (Third Brother, Third Brother, can you ask someone to send me some Profound Strike Talismans? The address is Golden River Road number 388. Ah, right, don\u2019t forget my compass.)After the last battle, she used a lot of energy from the compass so Chen Yu left it at Lou Ming\u2019s place. In addition, because she hadn\u2019t received any exorcising business recently, Chen Yu didn\u2019t retrieve it since then. Anyway, that compass was also happy to stay there.Lou Ming replied quickly: (Are you going to exorcise ghosts again? Is it dangerous?)Chen Yu smiled and replied: (With some Profound Strike Talismans blessed by Third Brother, it won\u2019t be dangerous.)Lou Ming, who was drawing a new gun design, smiled when he saw her reply, this little girl\u2019s mouth is quite sweet. Lou Ming put down his pen, turned around and took down a black box from the bookshelf. The box contained Profound Strike Talismans that Chen Yu drawn before she left, because he didn\u2019t know when the little girl would use it, Lou Ming always took it with him everywhere. When he slept, he put it under his bed, and when he worked in study room, he put it on the shelf, didn\u2019t know how much evil energy that these talismans have absorbed already.\u201cTian Fei.\u201d Lou Ming called Tian Fei in.\u201cThird Young Master.\u201d Tian Fei promptly came in.\u201cFind someone to send this box to Golden River Road number 388, have them send it to Chen Yu personally.\u201d Lou Ming ordered.\u201cYes.\u201d Tian Fei took the box and turned his heels to go out and do his task.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Lou Ming continued to give order, \u201cWhen the little girl finishes her matter, send her back.\u201d\u201cAffirmative!\u201d(I sent someone to give it to you, be careful.) Chen Yu suddenly felt relieved after reading Lou Ming\u2019s message. She put away her phone and checked outside.\u201cDid I offend you?\u201d Tong Chao really couldn\u2019t understand, he\u2019s an impressive female killer, how come this little girl treats him like this?\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong!\u201d Chen Yu nodded without hesitation, \u201cI finally convinced myself to help you (mainly because of 20 million), so don\u2019t offend me again.\u201dIf you make me lose money again, there\u2019s no need for the living dead to lift its hand, I\u2019d personally lift my hand to fix you up.\u201c...\u201d Young Master Tong, who felt a murderous aura, became reticent as he moved further aside.At this time, the sky had already became completely dark. Jiang Hui looked at the sky outside and reminded, \u201cHeavenly Master Chen, it\u2019s dark.\u201dTong Chao, who had been hunted for several nights, turned pale at the news.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Chen Yu opened the window, a burst of hot air rushed in. Even though it\u2019s night, the temperature of the city that had been roasted for a full day didn\u2019t drop, \u201cThe PM index in the air isn\u2019t good, spiritual power\u2019s concentration will become diluted by dust so I estimate that there\u2019s still another hour before it comes.\u201dThe old man\u2019s notes had recorded that if live zombies weren\u2019t fully activated, their bodies and souls were unstable, while moving would require them a certain concentration of spiritual power. At night, the concentration was higher and more stable, so the living dead are usually active at night. However, if they were fully activated, then there wouldn\u2019t be such limitation.\u201cHuh?\u201d Jiang Hui looked perplexed.\u201cPM Index?\u201d Tong Chao didn\u2019t believe it, \u201cCan it still be concerned about air quality?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the point ah, air pollution is so heavy that real person and ghosts alike all hate it ah.\u201d Chen Yu sighed.Had it not been for Second Uncle\u2019s repeated assurance that it was indeed this little girl named Chen Yu who had rescued him, he would have almost thought that he had encountered a fraud that can\u2019t even swindle anyone.Twenty minutes later, the car stopped at a mansion\u2019s door, while at the same time, He Qi, who was responsible for giving Chen Yu her Profound Strike Talismans, arrived.\u201cMiss Chen Yu, this is what Third Young Master asked me to send you.\u201d He Qi handed the box to Chen Yu.Chen Yu stretched out her hands to take it, opened the box and saw her compass and talismans inside, she immediately wasn\u2019t nervous anymore, \u201cAssistant He, thank you for sending this to me.\u201d\u201cMiss Chen Yu is too polite, I\u2019m just following orders.\u201d The implication was that he wanted her to thank Third Young Master.\u201cThen, send my thanks to Third Brother when you go back.\u201d Chen Yu said.He Qi smiled and nodded, standing still.\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Chen Yu said after thinking for a while, \u201cI don\u2019t really need anything more here, Assistant He, please go back first so you won\u2019t waste your time.\u201d\u201cMiss Chen Yu, Third Young Master told me to wait here all the time until you have resolved the matter smoothly before sending you back to school safely.\u201d He Qi said.\u201cNo need to trouble you like this, they can send me back at dawn.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cMiss Chen Yu, this is an order from Third Young Master.\u201d He Qi awkwardly.Chen Yu blinked her eyes, dumbfounded for a while before she said, \u201cAlright, Third Brother is really kind to me.\u201dHe Qi nodded in satisfaction, I only want to let you know how Third Young Master treats you well ah, otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be considered as completing my task 100%.Chen Yu took He Qi inside the mansion with her, although the exterior looked luxurious, there\u2019s not much things inside, you can tell that there\u2019s not many people living here.\u201cHeavenly Master Chen, do you need me to prepare anything?\u201d Jiang Hui walked over and said.\u201cNo need.\u201d Chen Yu said as she took out some Profound Strike Talismans from the box and put them inside her pocket. She didn\u2019t bring her linen bag, it really wasn\u2019t convenient ah.After putting the talismans securely, she checked the compass again to make sure that it has sufficient energy. She turned around and said to the people behind her, \u201cLater if that living\u2026 that monster comes, you two have to stay away, you\u2026\u201dChen Yu pointed to Tong Chao alone and ordered, \u201cFollow me, don\u2019t leave too far.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t I hide as far as possible?\u201d Because his memory when he was in his soul state was lost, Tong Chao no longer remembered the scene when Chen Yu protected him. He only remembered when Second Uncle searched for people to protect him, they always kept him away from the monster before taking other people to fight, resolutely not letting the monster approach him, that\u2019s why Chen Yu\u2019s arrangement was a bit strange for him.\u201cMy speed isn\u2019t better than that monster, if you\u2019re too far away and die before I can arrive, then I won\u2019t refund your money.\u201d Chen Yu said.What the heck \u2018not refunding money\u2019 about?\u201cCough\u2026 Young Master Tong, everything depends on Heavenly Master Chen\u2019s arrangements.\u201d Jiang Hui calmly said from the side.Just this week alone, Second Uncle Tong already found more than a dozen Heavenly Masters back and forth to protect him, all walked away wounded. Now, the only one who still has the courage to pick this task was Chen Yu. Although Tong Chao was scared, but he could only bite the bullet and nod obediently.They waited for a while when the surrounding temperature suddenly became cold, the four of them looked at the gate at the same time.Jiang Hui and Chen Yu were able to discover that something\u2019s wrong quickly because of their innate ability as Heavenly Master, Tong Chao was because he had experienced too many similar scenes during this period while He Qi was purely because of his essence as a fighter.\u201cCelestial Master Chen\u2026\u201d Jiang Hui looked at Chen Yu.Chen Yu conveniently slipped her phone that was half-playing \u2018Landlord\u2019 game to He Qi at the side, \u201cSorry, can you help me finish playing this?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d He Qi took the phone.\u201cLet\u2019s go out.\u201d Chen Yu looked at Tong Chao, who had a pale face, and motioned him to go out with her.Tong Chao looked at Chen Yu, then turned to look at Jiang Hui, his Second Uncle\u2019s disciple. Under the affirmative eyes of the other party, he bit his lips and followed Chen Yu.He Qi waited for the two to walk out the mansion\u2019s door, put Chen Yu\u2019s phone in his pocket, picked up the box on the table, and ran to the second floor. It\u2019s safe to stay inside, but if Miss Chen Yu encountered any danger, he wouldn\u2019t be able to help her by throwing more talismans.Jiang Hui was stunned for a second before he snapped out and followed He Qi to the second floor.In the yard, Chen Yu was holding the compass in her left hand and two Profound Strike Talismans in her right, quietly looking at the sky ahead where a thick black fog galloped under the eerie moonlight.\u201cIs it coming?\u201d Tong Chao\u2019s voice trembled because of fear.Chen Yu glanced at him with a little disgust in her eyes, \u201cWhy is he getting more and more timid in the one week I didn\u2019t see him?\u201d\u201c...\u201d He also didn\u2019t want to be like this ah, Tong Chao was extremely depressed, you try being chased by an invisible monster seven or eight times in a row, and every time you almost couldn\u2019t make it, \u201cAre you reliable or not?\u201d\u201cAre you really asking this question now?\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but curiously asked, \u201cWhat can you do if I\u2019m not reliable?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be a ghost and I\u2019ll latch onto you.\u201d Tong Chao said miserably.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that after your soul was swallowed, you won\u2019t even have a chance to be a ghost?\u201d Chen Yu asked in astonishment.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Tong Chao suddenly wanted to cry.\u201cIt\u2019s here!\u201d Jiang Hui, who was watching the scene from the second floor, saw that the black fog had already flown in front. Seeing that Chen Yu was still only talking with Young Master Tong, he immediately reminded them.BANG!\u00a0The two Profound Strike Talismans in Chen Yu\u2019s hand turned into a long sword from blood-red condensed evil aura. When the crimson aura strike that black mist, it immediately severed the dark barrier open and stabbed the soul inside directly.The demon flew upside-down using a speed that was two-fold faster than before, stopping five meters away in front of Chen Yu. The thick black energy continued to roll and slowly condensing, finally revealing the tall figure inside. It was obviously a spiritual body, but it\u2019s so solid, it could cast a shadow under the moonlight.Its spiritual body was much more solidified than last time, its vitality had became more intense. It seemed that a lot of souls had been swallowed during this time.Hadn\u2019t there many Heavenly Masters helping? How come he had swallowed this much? Looking at it, it was about to be resurrected and Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help frowning.\u201cIt\u2019s you again\u2026\u201d A hollow male voice suddenly sounded.\u201cHe, he can talk?\u201d Jiang Hui was obviously shocked.\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d He Qi couldn\u2019t hear the ghost and could only ask Jiang Hui on his side.Chen Yu swished her red sword across the demon\u2019s chest and asked, \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a few days, now you can talk?\u201d\u201cI will be resurrected soon, little Heavenly Master, please don\u2019t hinder me.\u201d said the living dead.\u201cWrong.\u201d Chen Yu shook her head, \u201cYou should be lacking one more spiritual energy from a living soul that\u2019s born from Yin year, Yin month and Yin day before you can resurrect. There are so many people who were born on that day, but not many such living soul posses pure Yin energy.\u201d\u201cSince you know that, then don\u2019t hinder me, I also don\u2019t want to kill another person.\u201d The living dead\u2019s gaze fell straight on the pale Tong Chao behind Chen Yu.\u201cIt\u2019s because of my understanding that I want to hinder you ah.\u201d Chen Yu said, the compass on her left hand was suddenly thrown out into the air, while at the same time, she followed along with her sword.The living dead raised his hand and threw out a black mist that stopped the compass\u2019 attack, but Chen Yu immediately followed with a swing of her sword. The demon avoided it several times, but because he was being restrained by the compass, having to deal with so many attacks at the same time, his palm was accidentally pierced by Chen Yu. Seeing a gust of black mist coming out of his palm, the living dead stared ruthlessly at Chen Yu\u2019s eyes, like a poisoned dagger.\u201cI don\u2019t believe you can protect him forever.\u201d He said coldly.\u201cWhy would I take that long?\u201d Chen Yu sneered, \u201cAren\u2019t you running out of time?\u201dThe expression on the living dead changed, suddenly, black energy all over his body surged again with a new vigor, but he didn\u2019t move to attack. He stared deadly to Chen Yu, as if he was planning on something, then he turned around and disappeared into the night all of a sudden.So easy?\u00a0Jiang Hui who had witnessed seven consecutive fierce battles, was stunned in place.\u00a0So many Heavenly Masters before couldn\u2019t stand a chance in front of this little girl\u2019s two tricks?As expected of talismans that were bought for ten million, so amazing!Author\u2019s NOTE:He Qi: To completely finish the task, aside from finishing the literal content of the task, also need to convey Third Young Master\u2019s inner thoughts, understand?Assistants: Understood.He Qi: Our Third Young Master isn\u2019t good at expressing himself, so we have to work harder for him, understand?Assistants: Understood!TL NOTE:Mon ami, it's been a long time since... forever. Hehe. (\u3186\u1d17\u3186) Sorry, it has been difficult to get a PR lately.PR: NesrynPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: Bullied By A GhostAlthough the living dead had retreated, the night was still long and no one can guarantee whether it would come back again or not, so Chen Yu can only stay in the mansion until dawn.As soon as it passed ten o\u2019clock, Chen Yu fell asleep on a sofa. She will have classes tomorrow, she can\u2019t stay up anymore.Seeing the Heavenly Master that was supposed to protect him fall asleep, Tong Chao was fuming. He really wanted to wake this person up. This little master is in danger but you can still sleep? However, when he only took two steps forward, He Qi, who was guarding at Chen Yu\u2019s side, gave him a slight squint. For some reason, Tong Chao felt his body instinctively stopped moving.He silently retracted his foot, found a sofa nearest to Chen Yu, and sat down. Forget it, it\u2019s better if I just sit closer.Jiang Hui saw Tong Chao\u2019s uneasiness, so he walked over to calm him down, \u201cYoung Master Tong, don\u2019t worry, when that monster comes, Heavenly Master Chen will definitely feel it.\u201dTong Chao immediately felt relieved after hearing Jiang Hui\u2019s explanation, he\u2019s no longer worried with Chen Yu\u2019s sleeping state, instead, he felt that the other party was just replenishing her energy. And thus, he also put his feet on the sofa and fell asleep like Chen Yu.Isn\u2019t he too worry-free?!The night passed, and as if she felt something, Chen Yu opened her eyes just when the sun appeared, \u201cDawn?\u201dChen Yu sat up from the sofa and rubbed her eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s dawn.\u201d standing on her side, He Qi replied readily.Chen Yu raised her eyes and looked at He Qi, she saw that his bearing was still straight, no slight wrinkles on his clothes, and doubtfully said, \u201cAssistant He, you haven\u2019t slept all night?\u201d\u201cThird Young Master asked me to protect you.\u201d He Qi emphasized again.Is he saying that he really didn\u2019t sleep all night?\u00a0Chen Yu felt unfamiliar with the new feeling of being carefully guarded like this. In fact, she knew clearly in her heart that Assistant He\u2019s protection wasn\u2019t that helpful. Assistant He\u2019s an ordinary person, they can\u2019t see ghosts or the living dead, so he can\u2019t help much even if the danger approaches.However, Chen Yu\u2019s heart was still very moved. They only met for several times, and also, majority of the times, it was her being thick-skinned and relying on Third Brother, but not only Third Brother wasn\u2019t mad at her, he also took care of her instead. Chen Yu was moved and made a firm decision in her heart that when she has the old man\u2019s number, she would definitely ask the old man about Third Brother\u2019s evil spirit.While thinking, Chen Yu turned her head and saw Tong Chao who was still sleeping on the other side of the sofa. She then said to Jiang Hui whose face looked tired, \u201cSince it\u2019s dawn, Tong Chao won\u2019t be in danger for the time being. I\u2019ll go back first.\u201d\u201cYes, Heavenly Master Chen, then, how about tonight?\u201d Although the monster was temporarily repelled, it didn\u2019t mean that it gave up on swallowing Tong Chao.\u201cI\u2019ll be here on time.\u201d Chen Yu promised.Jiang Hui immediately felt relieved. Last night, Heavenly Master Chen scared the monster away with just two tricks, so as long as Heavenly Master Chen was there, he can be assured that there will be no danger for Young Master Tong.After leaving Tong\u2019s mansion, He Qi drove towards Imperial University. The journey was very quiet. He Qi glanced at Chen Yu from the rear view mirror, she was playing a mobile game, so he asked, \u201cMs Chen Yu will go again tonight?\u201d\u201cOf course, the living dead only lacks Tong Chao\u2019s soul to be resurrected, it will definitely not give up easily.\u201d Chen Yu replied while checking the old man\u2019s notes again on her phone.Use seven Advanced Expelling Talisman and form a Seven Kill Formation.The last time she fought with the living dead, she ran out of Expelling Talisman and Chen Yu immediately became anxious. Seems like she had to go to Third Brother\u2019s house to rub for more energy to make more talismans, but she had a lot of classes this week, if she waited until the weekend to do so, then she would have no other way but to go to and fro to Tong\u2019s mansion every day.\u201cStill lacking? Hasn\u2019t that living dead already swallowed the souls of many people?\u201d He Qi asked curiously.\u201cIf he wants to completely rid of his astral state and become a living dead, he must continuously devour 16 living souls within 49 days.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cIn other words, it has swallowed 15 people?\u201d This means that that thing last night had already killed 15 people.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Chen Yu frowned, \u201cThat\u2019s why I have to send it away as soon as possible.\u201d Yes, she can only send it away.The old man\u2019s notes said that once the living dead started to devour living souls, their power will increase exponentially. The increasingly powerful vitality gave his soul a toughness and tenacity higher than a normal ghost, so it\u2019s a very difficult matter to directly attack it until its soul scatters, at least, not with Chen Yu\u2019s current skill. That\u2019s why, the best way was to open the spirit gate and hand him over to the two deities. [T/N: two deities, responsible for rewarding the good and punishing the bad]The old man meaning was: If it was me, I\u2019m just gonna beat it to death, but, little girl, it\u2019s best if you obediently open the gate ah, don\u2019t throw yourself in a moment of carelessness. When the living dead is really desperate, its self destruction power is really terrifying ah.\u201cIf it swallowed Tong Chao yesterday, what would it become?\u201d He Qi couldn\u2019t help but curiously asked.\u201cIt can leave its soul state and have a body.\u201d At that time, it won\u2019t be easy even just to find it.Isn\u2019t this a resurrection?\u00a0He Qi felt horrified for a while, \u201cCan people be resurrected after death?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cThis state only allows him to exist in this world like an ordinary person, that is to say, even if you don\u2019t have the yin yang eyes, you can still see and hear him. But he won\u2019t need to eat, sleep or breathe. He would return to his astral state every 30 years, and then start devouring living souls again and again. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the living dead.\u201d\u201cIn other word, this might not be the first time that he swallowed souls and resurrected?\u201d He Qi boldly guessed.\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility.\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s understanding of a living dead was all from the notes given by her grandpa, so she can\u2019t be really sure about the matter too, but because of the 30 year cycle, then the possibility of this situation happening is also very high.\u201cMiss Chen Yu, please be sure to get rid of it.\u201d He Qi suddenly solemnly requested, because this kind of invisible murderer is honestly very dreadful.Chen Yu was a little ignorant, but she still replied, \u201cSince I took this task, then I naturally won\u2019t stop halfway.\u201dAs the two chatted, they quickly arrived near Imperial University. Because Chen Yu wanted to have breakfast, He Qi drove to the university\u2019s side entrance where there were many food vendors lined up, selling breakfast every morning.When Chen Yu looked at the wonton vendor at the gate, her stomach began to growl, \u201cAssistant He, I\u2019ll treat you for breakfast, thank you for sending me here.\u201d\u201cMiss Chen Yu should thank Third Young Master, I\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s eat first, I\u2019ll buy another portion and let you bring it back to Third Brother, okay? This vendor\u2019s wonton is really delicious, Third Brother will definitely like it.\u201d Chen Yu said again.Bring breakfast to Third Young Master?\u00a0He Qi readily agreed.\u201cAside from wonton, everything here is also delicious ah.\u201d Chen Yu enthusiastically introduced as she walked forward, \u201cLike this hand-picked pancake, fruit pancake, steamed dumpling\u2026\u201dHe Qi listened with a smile when suddenly a sound of a small bullet streaking across the air entered He Qi\u2019s ears. He Qi\u2019s expression changed and he rolled over with Chen Yu to the back of a car.Whoosh!A bullet flashed past Chen Yu\u2019s shoulder and struck a white poplar tree beside her.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d He Qi told Chen Yu to stay still while he walked straight out, staring at the window on the third floor of a building across the road.The sniper on the opposite side met He Qi\u2019s eyes through the scope and knew that he was exposed, he quickly retrieved his rifle and fled the room hastily.He Qi knew that the other party would definitely flee after being discovered by him, but he still didn\u2019t dare to expose Chen Yu to another risk, so after reporting the situation to Third Young Master, He Qi took Chen Yu and drove away from Imperial University.\u201cWas that a gun just now?\u201d Chen Yu finally asked after her brain finally went online again.\u201cHave you offended anyone lately?\u201d He Qi asked while driving.\u201cNo one ah.\u201d Chen Yu said innocently. She has met more ghosts than people, where would she offend people?\u201cGo back to the compound first and see what Third Young Master would say.\u201d He Qi said.Chen Yu thought for a while but there\u2019s no other way, she can only follow He Qi back to the compound for her peace of mind.Lou Ming had received the news long before Chen Yu arrived. Although He Qi repeatedly assured that the little girl wasn\u2019t injured, Lou Ming still couldn\u2019t help but checked her from top to bottom in unease.\u201cI\u2019m really fine, just a little hungry.\u201d Chen Yu said pitifully, holding her stomach, \u201cI didn\u2019t have breakfast.\u201d\u201cYou ah.\u201d Lou Ming was helpless against her, he can only ask someone to prepare breakfast.After a while, two hot wonton bowls were delivered. Lou Ming saw Chen Yu eating with a satisfied expression, without any trace that she just escaped from death, he couldn\u2019t help but asked, \u201cUsually your ability is really good, how come you don\u2019t feel anything when someone pointed a gun at you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m an exorcist, I\u2019m only sensitive to Yin energy ah, evil spirit ah, hostile aura ah, things that are related to supernatural, but I\u2019m just a normal person normally.\u201d Chen Yu put up a helpless expression.\u201cWeren\u2019t you scared?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cOf course I\u2019m scared, but, my grandpa said that my life isn\u2019t short, that\u2019s why ah, I definitely won\u2019t die young.\u201d Chen Yu said as she gave an example, \u201cYou see, assistant He saved me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really optimistic.\u201d Lou Ming was about to laugh from anger, this girl didn\u2019t know how lucky she was just now. His seven assistants lead by He Qi were masters specially selected by the country itself from tens of thousands of special forces, they all have many experiences in battles. Otherwise, if changed with another person today, they won\u2019t detect an attack in that situation and saved her promptly.\u201cHey, hey\u2026 Third Brother, you also eat ah, the wonton will go cold in a bit.\u201d Chen Yu said to comfort him, \u201cI\u2019ll call my Elder Brother when I finish eating.\u201d\u201cYou want to report to the police?\u201d Lou Ming knew that Chen Yang was a police officer.\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cYou want to report to police when you don\u2019t know anything?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cSomeone wants to kill me ah, why shouldn\u2019t I report this to police?\u201d Chen Yu retorted.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d This girl was almost killed, and she didn\u2019t even think about what went wrong. She\u2019s going to call the police directly and ignore the matter? Lou Ming was about to fume with hot air, \u201cYou\u2019ve just arrived in Imperial Capital, you have barely been to any other places except for school and home and you also don\u2019t know many people? Why would you suddenly offend someone that they would hire an assassin to kill you?\u201d\u201cI also find it strange, that\u2019s why I want to report it to police ah.\u201d Chen Yu replied.\u201c...\u201d Lou Ming gave up explaining to her and just said directly, \u201cYou should take a leave of absence after your meal, and don\u2019t go to school today. Don\u2019t call police and wait until He Qi and the others investigate the matter clearly before taking further action. You also don\u2019t want to let your family to know that you\u2019re exorcising ghosts at night, right?\u201dChen Yu nodded, agreeing to Lou Ming\u2019s suggestion. Since she didn\u2019t have to go to class, and luckily she was at Third Brother\u2019s house, Chen Yu decided to draw some Expelling Talismans that she planned to prepare in this morning. The Lou family\u2019s small courtyard was full of spiritual energy, although advanced talismans are difficult to draw, but with lady luck, she might be able to draw all seven of them today. After all, Chen Yu\u2019s ability to draw talismans was the only thing that ever received any praise from that poisonous old man.And thus, Chen Yu took some talisman papers and cinnabar which Lou Ming ordered to buy from outside, and drew talismans for the whole day. She didn\u2019t stop until four o\u2019clock in the afternoon when Cheng Peng brought an investigation report and walked in.\u201cThird Young Master, the assassin that attacked Miss Chen Yu has been found. Named Li Feng, he used to be a mercenary who crossed organizations. He received an order from Internet at nine o\u2019clock last night to kill Miss Chen Yu.\u201d Cheng Peng briefed, \u201cWe checked the IP address and found that the owner account was Zong Mingqing, the owner of an antique shop, currently\u2026\u201d\u201cHe was hospitalized three months ago due to illness and currently recuperating in the water-bound An City?\u201d Lou Ming also saw it from the report.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Cheng Peng glanced at Chen Yu and said, \u201cGiven the relatively simple background of Miss Chen Yu, the people that she offended recently\u2026 is just the living dead who she fought last night.\u201d Cough, he felt weird saying that.Cheng Peng couldn\u2019t help but paused before continuing, \u201c Miss Chen Yu said that this living dead can survive in the world like any ordinary people after devouring some living souls, but they will return to their astral state every 30 years and needs to consume living souls again, so\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you suspect that this man was the living dead from last night?\u201d Chen Yu asked in shock.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Cheng Peng nodded.Lou Ming was also taken aback, he clearly didn\u2019t expect that ghosts could rent assassins, but this living dead was obviously different from ordinary ghosts. Reincarnation once every thirty years, maybe this living dead had been living longer than they thought.\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him now!\u201d after hearing this, Chen Yu slammed the table and picked up her compass as she was about to go out in rage.\u201cYou, calm down.\u201d Lou Ming stretched out his hand to stop Chen Yu.\u201cI can\u2019t calm down!\u201d Chen Yu really was about to die from being so vexed, \u201cI\u2019m this big, but I haven\u2019t been bullied by a ghost before!\u201dIt\u2019s as if others had been bullied by ghosts\u2026\u201cI\u2019m a dignified exorcist, I must be crazy if I let a ghost bully me like this.\u201d\u2026it seems that there\u2019s some truth.Author\u2019s NOTE:Old man: I have taught you for so many years, but you were actually bullied by a ghost?Xishi: How would I know that a ghost can still rent a killer?Old man: You won\u2019t be alert enough if you don\u2019t have enough sleep.Third Young Master: Girl, there\u2019s me, no one can hurt you.The seven assistants all nodded in unison.TL NOTE:Oh wow, ghost using assassin nowadays.

    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Seven Killing ArrayLou Ming finally held on to the little girl who was stamping with fury, as he looked at her panting and huffing little face, he asked, \u201cYou\u2019re rushing like this, do you know where to find him?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Chen Yu thought for a while before replying, \u201cI\u2019ll go to Tong\u2019s mansion, anyway, if he wants to be completely resurrected, then he must swallow Tong Chao\u2019s soul, so I\u2019ll just go to Tong\u2019s mansion and wait for him.\u201d\u201cWhat if he won\u2019t come out when he sees you there?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cNo way.\u201d Chen Yu said confidently, \u201cIf he wants to be resurrected, he must swallow Tong Chao\u2019s soul within 49 days, or else he must search for another 15 living souls again.\u201d\u201cYou mean that if the time is up and he\u2019s unable to swallow Tong Chao\u2019s soul then he will start killing again?\u201d Lou Ming responded quickly.\u201cCorrect, that\u2019s why he will appear again soon.\u201d Judging from the living dead\u2019s aura last night, Chen Yu was almost sure that he has not much time left.\u201cCheng Peng, go and check if there\u2019s any bizarre death cases lately, and when was the earliest one.\u201d Lou Ming said to Chen Peng who was standing on his side.\u201cIt\u2019s been checked.\u201d After He Qi listened to Chen Yu\u2019s information about the living dead, he also checked about the matter, \u201cThe police department is indeed investigating a special case recently, there are fifteen people that died suddenly for no reason in the last two months. When death toll reached 8 people, they moved the case to special department. The earliest victim died 45 days ago.\u201d\u201cFour days left? I\u2019ll go to Tong\u2019s mansion now and stay there for a few days.\u201d Chen Yu said, picking up her compass, wanting to rush out again.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Lou Ming thought about Chen Yu\u2019s sorry figure when she fought with that living dead a week ago, he asked worriedly, \u201cCan you deal with it alone?\u201dChen Yu was immediately discouraged by Lou Ming\u2019s question, \u201cI can\u2019t beat him\u2026\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Lou Ming was about to say that he could ask someone for help when he heard Chen Yu\u2019s additional ferocious sentence.\u201cBut I can make him go away.\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cHe\u2019s trying so hard to resurrect, doesn\u2019t he just want to live in this world? Humph! Then I\u2019ll send him back to the underworld, let the two deities clean him up, see if he still can pay for another assassin ah, isn\u2019t buying assassin his innate skill? Humph!\u201dLou Ming couldn\u2019t help but smiled, he asked, \u201cYou can send him to the underworld?\u201d\u201cEn, although I also want to beat him up, but I still don\u2019t have enough skill now\u2026\u201d The feeling of not being able to avenge herself was really not good ah.Then I\u2019ll let He Qi send a few people to follow you.\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cThere\u2019s no need, I\u2026\u201d\u201cI know that you\u2019re good with exorcising ghosts, but you can\u2019t beat He Qi and others against weapons in the living world.\u201d Lou Ming interrupted before Chen Yu finished, \u201cThere are four days left, he must be more anxious than you, if he appears on purpose and leads you where someone can shoot you, can you avoid it?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d Chen Yu thought for a while and shook her head honestly.\u201cThen these few days, be obedient and let He Qi and others follow you.\u201d Lou MIng said.\u201cOh.\u201d Chen Yu looked at Lou Ming emotionally, \u201cThird Brother, you\u2019re so kind to me.\u201dLou Ming smiled and rubbed her head dotingly, \u201cBecause you\u2019re also kind.\u201dOrdinary people can live their ordinary lives because there\u2019s you who conscientiously exorcise ghosts.Chen Yu felt herself blush after being praised and can only foolishly \u2018hehe\u2019 laughed.At this time, inside the Tong family\u2019s residence, the sickly-looking Second Uncle Tong was discussing the matter with two Heavenly Masters from Liang and Qin family. These two people were successors from their respective families which were two of the three biggest Heavenly Master families in Imperial Capital.\u201cBrother Tong, how\u2019s your health?\u201d Liang Huazhou, Liang Guang\u2019s father, the next head of Liang family, asked.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll be fine after a while.\u201d when Tong Wei finished speaking, he coughed twice while clutching his chest.The other Heavenly Master, Qin Feiming, asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Tong Chao?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s okay.\u201d Tong Wei had already received report from his apprentice Jiang Hui that Heavenly Master Chen actually scared the monster away with just two tricks. If he knew this, Tong Wei wouldn\u2019t be concerned about her identity as a mayor\u2019s daughter and asked for her help earlier.\u201cThat\u2019s good then.\u201d Qin Feiming said.\u201cBrother Qin, brother Liang, my Tong family is well-known for its Eight Trigrams, that\u2019s why we\u2019re inferior in exorcising ghosts than you two. In these few days, have you guys figured out what this thing actually is?\u201d Tong Wei asked.Liang Huazhou and Qin Feiming glanced at each other and said, \u201cYesterday, my father and I looked through some of predecessor\u2019s records and thought that this thing might be the living dead in the legend.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Qin Feiming agreed.\u201cLiving dead?\u201d Tong Wei has never heard of such a thing.\u201cThis is a black magic originated from a great metaphysics school 600 years ago.\u201d Qin Feiming started, \u201cIt\u2019s said that the next master of this school was a genius. However, his wife died suddenly one day, and this disciple didn\u2019t want to part with her, hence he hid his wife\u2019s soul and studied this black magic for ten years.\u201d\u201cHe refined it through a special method, allowing his wife\u2019s soul to swallow fifteen living souls from people who was born in Yin year, Yin month and Yin day within 49 days, as well as one living soul that carries pure Yin energy. Afterwards, his wife actually returned to her body and came alive, this is the origin of the living dead.\u201d\u201cWhat about after that?\u201d Tong Wei asked, \u201cSince there\u2019s a record, then there must be a solution.\u201dLiang Huazhou sighed, \u201cThe one who got rid of the living dead 600 years ago was a Heavenly Master from Luoshan Sect.\u201d\u201cLuoshan Sect?\u201d Tong Wei was surprised, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard of it?\u201d\u201cLuoshan Sect was another branch in Exorcist world, it had stopped its inheritance since early years so it isn\u2019t strange that you haven\u2019t heard about them.\u201dQin Feiming thought about the decline of Luoshan Sect and felt that it was such a pity, \u201cLuoshan Sect\u2019s art was on another level, practically no one can surpass them.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 is there any other way to get rid of the living dead except for relying on Luoshan Sect?\u201d Tong Wei asked, \u201cCan you guys Heavenly Masters open the Spirit Gate and send him to the underworld?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that we haven\u2019t thought about this.\u201d Liang Huazhou said, \u201cThere are two requirements to open a Spirit Gate. One, the Heavenly Master\u2019s cultivation must be on a certain level, second, there must be a ghost to lead him in.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t you guys\u2019 cultivation levels enough to open Spirit Gate?\u201d Tong Wei doubtfully asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of cultivation.\u201d Qin Feiming said, \u201cIt\u2019s about the ghost. The living dead has too much vitality in his body because of his swallowing living souls, the underworld might not open if it detected his vitality.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Liang Huazhou nodded in agreement. Underworld is a place for the dead, where would there be vitality?\u201cThen what should we do? I fought with it these days, I can feel its power getting stronger day by day, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d Tong Wei didn\u2019t say what he was afraid of, but the three of them understood inside.\u201cBrother Tong, don\u2019t worry, we have already posted the mission on Metaphysics website, we\u2019ll see if anyone knows how to deal with the living dead.\u201d Liang Huazhou said, \u201cAs for Tong Chao, I and Feiming will protect him in this period.\u201dIt\u2019s natural that Qin Feiming and Liang Huazhou wanted to protect Tong Chao. Although Chen Yu promised that she would protect Tong Chao, the living dead\u2019s strength grew stronger each passing day, one more person can give one protection more.Thus, that night, when Chen Yu walked into the mansion along with Tian Fei who was wearing camouflage clothing, she also saw two middle-aged men wearing Chinese traditional robe.\u201cHeavenly Master Chen, you\u2019re here.\u201d Jiang Hui saw Chen Yu and quickly greeted her.Chen Yu glanced at the two Heavenly Masters sitting on the sofa behind as well as the strong spiritual fluctuations surrounding them. Chen Yu dragged Jiang Hui aside and asked, \u201cThose two are here to protect Tong Chao?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Jiang Hui replied.\u201cThen I can only take one-third of the commission?\u201d If she knew that they would invite more people, she should have asked for the commission money yesterday.\u201cCough\u2026 no, no, Master Qin and Master Liang are both friends of this family\u2019s master, they\u2019re here to help as volunteers this time.\u201d Jiang Hui said.\u201cThere are such outstanding people in this world? They don\u2019t even want the 10 million commission, what good person ah.\u201d Chen Yu looked at the two Heavenly Masters with admiration.Tian Fei on the side couldn\u2019t endure the corners of his mouth from bending up.Jiang Hui\u2019s mouth twitched, he suddenly didn\u2019t know how to answer. Anyway, he knew that when the matter was over, it would be better to send ten million to Master Chen as early as possible.\u201cYou are Chen Yu, the little Heavenly Master.\u201d Qin Feiming saw Chen Yu\u2019s young age and pure spiritual energy that thoroughly covered her whole body, she\u2019s much better than a lot of juniors that he ever met before, that\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t help but think highly of her.\u201cHello, my name is Chen Yu, my nickname is Exorcist Xishi.\u201d Master said that Heavenly Masters like to report their Taoist name or nickname between themselves.\u201cHahaha! Good nickname, good nickname.\u201d Qin Feiming and Liang Huazhou were stunned for a second before they burst out laughing.\u201cPfft~\u201d Tong Chao who was sitting quietly on one side couldn\u2019t stifle his laughter.Hearing that, Chen Yu narrowed her eyes and looked over him.I just\u2026 just watched a comedy, so\u2026\u201d Tong Chao just found an excuse for his laughter when an apple suddenly hit his body, resulting with a howl of pain.Tong Chao rubbed his chest and stared at Tian Fei next to Chen Yu.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my hand slipped just now.\u201d Tian Fei said insincerely.Only ghosts would believe that, however, Tong Chao dared to be angry but didn\u2019t dare to speak, he knew at first glance that he couldn\u2019t beat him.\u201cThat\u2019s a great one.\u201d Chen Yu gave a thumbs up openly.\u201cThird Young Master ordered us to protect you properly.\u201d Verbal attacks are also within his protection....Which family\u2019s Third Young Master would shield her shortcomings?Ding-a-ling!Tian Fei\u2019s phone suddenly rang, so he took it out and saw: (Two snipers were found in the surrounding buildings, they all have been dealt with.)Tian Fei replied that he received the message, then walked to Chen Yu and whispered, \u201cMiss Chen Yu, the area has been cleared.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s eyes lit up immediately, \u201cI\u2019ll let him come and not return today!\u201d\u201cLittle Heavenly Master is so powerful.\u201d Qin Feiming smiled.\u201cI heard that you scared away the living dead alone yesterday, what method did you use?\u201d Liang Huazhou asked curiously.\u201cMethods handed down in family.\u201d Chen Yu answered sincerely and straightforwardly.The two masters coughed awkwardly, because they\u2019re afraid of being misunderstood as elders trying to steal unique spells from other people\u2019s family, the two of them didn\u2019t talk much with Chen Yu in the following time.At this moment, the atmosphere inside the room suddenly changed.Qin Feiming and Liang Huazhou looked at each other, when they were about to move, the little girl in white T-shirt ran out before them. Not only did she ran out, but she also dragged Tong Chao outside.Their expressions changed, is this little girl fooling around ah? The living dead\u2019s goal was Tong Chao, why did she take him out? The two thought like this as they followed along.Chen Yu pulled Tong Chao until they reached the courtyard. She looked up at the black mist that was approaching from the distance, turned around and said to Tong Chao, \u201cDon\u2019t move no matter what happens in this time.\u201d\u201cI was wrong to laugh at you just now, don\u2019t give up one me ah.\u201d Tong Chao thought that Chen Yu was taking her revenge because he accidentally laughed at her.\u201cYou won\u2019t die!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not you with the risk of death, of course you can say this.\u201d Tong Chao was really scared by this ghost these days, \u201cCan\u2019t I be by your side like yesterday?\u201d\u201cYou really want to be chased by him for a lifetime ah?!\u201d Chen Yu said loudly, \u201cJust stand there, not only I can guarantee that you will be safe, but I will also won\u2019t let him appear in front of you again after tonight.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally!\u201d\u201cI really want to do so, but I\u2019m afraid that I can\u2019t control myself.\u201d Tong Chao said with a shaking voice.Bam!\u00a0Tian Fei chopped Tong Chao\u2019s neck with a karate chop until he fainted and said to the dumbfounded Chen Yu, \u201cIs this not good?\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t good ah!\u201d Chen Yu said dazedly.\u201cDidn\u2019t he agree just now?\u201dDid he?Jiang Hui and the two Heavenly Masters arrived at the same time when Tian Fei chopped Tong Chao, their expressions changed again. Jiang Hui rushed over but he was caught by Tian Fei, \u201cDon\u2019t disturb Heavenly Master Chen.\u201dAs soon as Qin Feiming and Liang Huazhou were about to help over, they saw Chen Yu raising her hands and throwing out seven talismans. Those talismans formed a very strange shape that encircled the faint Tong Chao before disappearing. The two of them paused in their steps, at the same time, there was a visible shock in their eyes.The moment the talismans appeared, a formidable aura of death made them stood still in shock. They stayed in their place unconsciously, not moving forward, they wanted to see how this little Heavenly Master Chen would deal with the living dead.They were all in the same yard anyway, there\u2019s no way that living dead can hurt Tong Chao under their noses.TL NOTE:I just realized. Chen Yu protects Lou Ming with spiritual force, while Lou Ming protects Chen Yu with physical force.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: Almost Forgot To Take The TaskIn order to prevent her 10 million from being divided with others, Chen Yu was determined to not give the two Heavenly Masters Qin and Liang the chance to move.Chen Yu transformed the Profound Strike Talisman into a long sword with evil energy, and pointed it straight to the flying living dead. However this time, the living dead didn\u2019t rush to Tong Chao who had fainted on the ground like the previous two times, but directly went to fight with Chen Yu instead.Although Tian Fei couldn\u2019t see anything, but Chen Yu\u2019s fierce movements and the air flow fluctuations were enough to make him aware of the violent battle.As for the three Heavenly Masters on the side, Jiang Hui didn\u2019t say anything. He had seen Chen Yu\u2019s skill yesterday, but it was the first time for Qin Feiming and Liang Huazhou to see Chen Yu fight. They saw how Chen Yu was already able to use talismans at such a young age. This skill and talent couldn\u2019t be achieved with just hard work, even they themselves were unable to easily use these techniques.Both of them saw clear shock in each other\u2019 eyes before they turned their eyes to the scene again, only to see the living dead that made Heavenly Masters in Imperial City all turned upside down, was avoiding Chen Yu everywhere.Actually, it wasn\u2019t Chen Yu that the living dead was avoiding. Although Chen Yu had special techniques, but that living dead\u2019s cultivation still couldn\u2019t be suppressed by Chen Yu\u2019s. What he was afraid of was the evil aura in Chen Yu\u2019s hand. The crimson evil aura, which was extracted from some kind of zombie, unexpectedly terrified him. Last time he was stabbed by that was sword, he had to swallow two souls before he barely recovered.There were only four days left for the living dead to resurrect. He looked to Tong Chao who fainted and laid on the ground not far away, determination to win was apparent in his eyes. Tonight, this night, he must swallow this child\u2019s soul.While thinking, the living dead pretended that he can\u2019t win and deliberately retreated three meters back. When Chen Yu saw it, she chased him without thinking, but when she just took three steps forward, Chen Yu\u2019s movements suddenly stopped. Her face was in pain, and she suddenly fell to the ground.The living dead seemed to have expected this sudden change. He glanced at the faintly flashing red light in the opposite building, a successful smile plastered on his face.I clearly reminded you that you\u2019re looking for death yesterday.The living dead need to resurrect once every thirty years, excluding this time, he had been reborn a total of eight times, how could he hadn\u2019t met such a powerful Heavenly Master in more than two hundred years of his \u2018life\u2019?But no matter how powerful the Heavenly Master was, they still can\u2019t contend against human weapons. His cultivation base might not be on par, but he still had money, and money equals strength in human world.The living dead saw that Chen Yu had lost her fighting capability, although she didn\u2019t die immediately, it\u2019s apparent that she didn\u2019t have the power to stop him no more. He glanced at the two Heavenly Masters who were flying over not far away, there was a hint of sarcasm in his eyes. Since he came prepared tonight, he definitely won\u2019t fail.The living dead raised his hand and let out two screams full of hostility, these two screams contained evil energy that he specially collected from two one-hundred year old ferocious ghosts. Although he couldn\u2019t hurt these two Heavenly Masters, but he only needed one minute to swallow the living soul anyway.The living dead hindered Qin Feiming and Liang Huazhou with these two ghosts, and under Jiang Hui\u2019s horrified look, he rushed towards Tong Chao, who had just awakened from a coma and was trying to get up.\u201cYoung Master Tong, run!\u201d Jiang Hui couldn\u2019t get away from Tian Fei\u2019s clutch, so he could only scream in horror.\u201cHuh??\u201d Tong Chao still didn\u2019t understand what was going on when suddenly it became pitch dark in front of his eyes and his whole body was shrouded in a black veil.\u201cYoung Master Tong!\u201d Jiang Hui almost went limp on the ground in shock.Qin Feiming and Liang Huazhou directly sacrificed their magic weapons in order to quickly defeat the ghosts in front of them and save Tong Chao as quickly as possible, but they both knew in their hearts that they might be too late.\u201cRise!\u201dAt this moment, a clear shout sounded in the dark night, they only saw the dark mist that enveloped Tong Chao just now was suddenly trapped by a golden, peculiar formation composed by seven talismans. A divine light glimmered, a murderous aura soared, the living dead wailed horrendously, and a figure was revealed from inside that black mist.\u201cSeven Killing Array?\u201d The living dead was obviously someone who had seen the world before, and he hit the nail on the head as he revealed the formation.Chen Yu didn\u2019t have time to chit-chat with him, the two Heavenly Masters next to her were about to clean up the ghosts. She had to send the living dead away quickly, no one was allowed to steal her merit ah. Thinking like this, Chen Yu\u2019s hand movements became a bit faster unconsciously, while her right hand did some formations, her left hand threw the compass in the air.While spinning, the compass stopped right in front of the living dead, and with rapid rotation, bursts of spiritual power continued to flow out to form a hollow vortex.\u201cYou\u2019re going to open Spirit Gate?\u201d The living dead found that Chen Yu was planning to open Spirit Gate and immediately struggled even harder, \u201cIt\u2019s useless, my body carries vitality, it won\u2019t open.\u201dChen Yu saw that the spiritual track has been established, so the next thing to do was to activate the formation to temporarily dissolve the dense vitality inside the living dead\u2019s body.That\u2019s right, it just disappeared temporarily. Chen Yu still didn\u2019t have such high level of spiritual power that can directly eliminate the living dead\u2019s vitality, so she can only depended on the Seven Killing Array. It only took a moment for the murderous aura of Seven Killing Array to devour the exposed vitality of the living dead, and the Spirit Gate finally gave a reaction.Chen Yu mobilized all of her spiritual power to maximize the Seven Killing Array\u2019s murderous aura. There was a golden-red flame of murderous aura inside the dazzling golden divine light, raging and flashing, devouring the living dead\u2019s dense vitality.Crack\u2026\u00a0Following the sound of a heavy gate opening, majestic cloud suddenly appeared, making the midsummer night look as cold as winter.Qin Feiming and Liang Huazhou had already dispersed the ghosts at this time, they were now staring dazedly at the opening Spirit Gate that appeared so suddenly.It\u2019s the living dead, wouldn\u2019t it be impossible to open Spirit Gate?While Jiang Hui, who saw a Spirit Gate for the first time, was completely stunned at this time.Seeing that Jiang Hui was not struggling anymore, Tian Fei let go and rubbed the goosebumps that emerged on his arm because of the sudden cold.However at this time, facing the Spirit Gate that was really opening in front of him, the living dead began to struggle frantically. The lingering black mist around him kept on churning over and over, his evil energy trapped firmly by the Seven Killing Array.\u201cI can give you money, I have a lot, a lot of money, ten million, twenty million, thirty million? You can have as much as you want.\u201d The living dead shouted as he saw Chen Yu who was approaching him.That\u2019s right, Heavenly Masters are also humans, as long as they\u2019re human, they won\u2019t dislike moneyOh sh*t!\u00a0Jiang Hui, who knew that Chen Yu loved money, suddenly turned pale. Your mom, even a ghost can be so rich nowadays?Chen Yu fixedly looked at the living dead with blinking lights inside her eyes. This kind of look had been seen by the living dead so many times already, this was the look of a human being after being tempted by money ah. Just when the living dead thought that he can avoid disaster, Chen Yu fiercely pushed the living dead into the Spirit Gate.The moment the living dead entered, Spirit Gate closed with a creak, at the same time, the compass in the air stopped spinning and returned to Chen Yu\u2019s hands, she said with a bitter face, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m avaricious, but money still has to be received in a right way.\u201dTian Fei saw that Chen Yu didn\u2019t move after getting the compass back, the surrounding temperature was also warming up a little bit so he guessed that the matter should have been resolved. He immediately walked to Chen Yu and asked, \u201cMiss Chen Yu, has the matter been resolved smoothly?\u201d\u201cAssistant Tian\u2026\u201d Chen Yu raised her head, with tears trickling from her eyes pitifully.\u201cMiss\u2026 Miss Chen Yu, you\u2026 what happened? Did you get hurt?\u201d Tian Fei was shocked when he saw Chen Yu\u2019s expression.\u201cI-I just lost ten million ah!!\u201d She can receive 20 million from exorcising the living dead, but that living dead just told her that he can give her 30 million, a full difference of 10 million ah, it felt like one of her feet entered the Spirit Gate itself ah.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d For the first time, the courageous special force guy didn\u2019t know what to do.At this time, the two Heavenly Masters Qin and Liang, who saw the living dead sent away in such crude and simple manner by Chen Yu, walked to Chen Yu\u2019s side with a gentle smile and asked, \u201cHeavenly Master Chen, may I ask how you opened the Spirit Gate just now?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Chen Yu was still inside the sorrow of missing that ten million, so she replied listlessly, \u201cMy grandfather taught me the Seven Killing Array.\u201d\u201cSeven Killing Array?\u201d Qin Feiming looked at Liang Huazhou and asked, \u201cBrother Liang, do you know of Chen family in metaphysics circle?\u201dLiang Huazhou thought for a moment, then shook his head.\u201cLittle Heavenly Master Chen, if your grandfather is in Imperial City now, I wonder if we can have the honour to pay a visit?\u201d Someone who was able to teach such an excellent granddaughter, and also, with a learning of such extremely formidable techniques, Qin Feiming was naturally very curious about Chen Yu\u2019s grandfather.\u201cMy grandfather isn\u2019t in Imperial City.\u201d Chen Yu hesitated and said, \u201cBut if he comes, I\u2019ll help you ask.\u201d\u201cOkay, then I have to trouble Little Heavenly Master.\u201d Qin Feiming took out his phone and said, \u201cThen, let\u2019s exchange contact information first.\u201dChen Yu casually took out her phone and added a WeChat account, without knowing that she became one of the few people in Imperial Capital who owned the WeChat of the two future successors of Qin and Liang family.After a while, the unconscious Tong Chao woke up, he learned from Jiang Hui that the living dead had been eliminated and ran excitedly to Qin and Liang to ask for proof, \u201cUncle Qin, Uncle Liang, did that monster really had been sent off? Then, I won\u2019t be in danger anymore, right?\u201d\u201cYes, Tong Chao, you have to really thank Little Heavenly Master Chen this time.\u201d Qin Feiming smiled.\u201cLittle girl, I didn\u2019t think you really have some ability.\u201d Young Master Tong began to speak with confidence again, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you saved me, I definitely won\u2019t treat you badly. Although you\u2019re a bit dark, but the foundation isn\u2019t bad, one of these days I\u2019ll give you a proper repair\u2026\u201dChen Yu looked at the guy who started to ridicule her as dark and was struggling on whether she should punch him after she took the money or if she should beat him first and take money later when suddenly she heard Liang Huazhou talking to Qin Feiming on the side, \u201cSince the living dead has been removed, then tell someone to delete the task on Metaphysics Website.\u201cWait a minute!\u201dQin Feiming who was about to talk, was startled by Chen Yu\u2019s sudden shout. He looked at Chen Yu in surprise and saw that she quickly took out her phone, logged in to Metaphysics Website in front of him, turned to the task page, rapidly took the task, then swiftly submitted it. From beginning to end, it only took her less than one minute.Ting-a-ling\u2026A dumbfounded Qin Feiming immediately took his phone, \u201cHeavenly Master Qin, the A-level task that you posted this morning was accepted and submitted just now, please check, if the mission is confirmed, we need to pay the other party five million RMB.\u201dAlthough Qin Feiming had seen it with his own eyes, but he can\u2019t control his mouth to ask, \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cThe other party\u2019s ID is Exorcist Xishi.\u201dQin Feiming hung up the phone, and looked strangely at the complacent \u2018Exorcist Xishi\u2019, this is such a convenient profit, give or not give ah?\u201cAlthough the fee is a bit more expensive, but it\u2019s still several millions ah, hahahaha~\u201d Chen Yu saw that Liang Huazhou was looking at herself, so she said gratefully, \u201cHeavenly Master Liang, thanks to you for reminding me just now, otherwise I would almost forgot to take the task.\u201d\u201c...\u201dDidn\u2019t you heard it just now? That mission was posted by me and Qin Feiming ah.Tian Fei was also astonished with Chen Yu\u2019s \u2018shamelessness\u2019, but comrade Tian Fei who was very clear inside and outside, just calmly took out his phone and said to his brothers who were hiding outside, \u201cThe matter is resolved, gather!\u201dAfter a while, six big men suddenly appeared in the mansion\u2019s courtyard, they accompanied Chen Yu to settle the bill before leaving.When Chen Yu left, Jiang Hui said with great joy, \u201cOh gosh, luckily the card has enough money.\u201dAuthor\u2019s NOTE:Tian Fei returned to dormitory and reported today\u2019s battle with other assistants.Tian Fei: Miss Chen Yu just pressed her phone and received five million more.All assistants: That\u2019s amazing, such a wealthy husband ah!!TL NOTE:Lol, Chen Yu, as usual, is raking in money left and right \u10e6\u0dc0\ua1f3\u0dc0\u10e6Alright, Novi will take over for the next 10 chapters or so~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31-1: Extremely Noble AuraSanqing Temple was built in the Tang Dynasty and has stood for 1,266. Going through several dynasties, it still stood beside the Imperial City. This building, which was older than the ancient Imperial Palace, has not received protection as a cultural relic, on the contrary, it was still treated as a Taoist Temple with people swarming in to burn joss sticks and candles.Master Mao was the master of this temple.Master Mao had just finished a ritual today, before he walked back to his room, he saw a little disciple stepping up and told him, \u201cMaster, Madam Lou is here.\u201dMaster Mao paused and asked, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d\u201cWaiting for Master in the guest room.\u201d The little disciple replied.Master Mao raised his hand and dismissed the disciple behind him. He turned and walked towards the guest room. From afar he saw Madam Lou standing at the window.\u201cMadam Lou, why do you have time to visit Sanqing Temple today?\u201d Master Mao walked forward with a smile.\u201cI took the liberty to come, I hope I didn\u2019t disturb Master.\u201d When Lou Ming first met with a mishap, the Lou husband and wife practically searched for every well-known mystical master in Imperial City. In the end, only Master Mao from Sanqing Temple could suppress Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit, that\u2019s why the Lou family had a good impression and trusted Master Mao.The two exchanged greetings, then sat down facing each other in the guest room.Madam Lou pulled out three photos from her bag and handed them along with three pieces of red paper to Master Mao, \u201cMaster Mao, please help me read these three girls\u2019 eight characters are very good or not?\u201dMaster Mao obviously didn\u2019t expect Madam Lou to come here to ask his help on reading three girls\u2019 eight characters, but he didn\u2019t refuse. He took the three red papers from the table and looked at the pictures of the girls. After a careful reading, he then said, \u201cYes, these three girls have very good looks and eight characters, their fates are of a wealthy and glorious life.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Madam Lou looked at Master Mao nervously, her fingers clutching the edge of her purse turned white, \u201cIf they get together with Lou Ming\u2026\u201dMaster Mao suddenly raised his head and looked at Madam Lou with some surprise.\u201cI remember, Master, you said this before.\u201d Madam Lou clearly remembered what Master Mao said when Lou Ming was declared unable to make contact with people and that he could only live within the Lou\u2019s small courtyard.\u201d At that time, you said my son, Lou Ming is entangled with evil spirits, the bane of other\u2019s existence, other than people with extremely noble aura, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get close with him.\u201d\u201cCouldn\u2019t it also be said that people with an extremely noble aura would not fear Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirits?\u201d Madam Lou asked in earnest hope.\u201cBe that as it may, but your action\u2026\u201d Master Mao boldly guessed, \u201cDo you want one of these three women as Lou Ming\u2019s wife?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Madam Lou didn\u2019t conceal her intention.\u201cMadam Lou, have you ever asked Lou Ming about your thoughts?\u201d Master Mao asked with a sigh.\u201cNot yet.\u201d Madam Lou said, \u201cMaster Mao, you just need to tell me if there\u2019s any of these three girls who can safely make contact with Lou Ming. You don\u2019t have to care about other things, I will take care of the rest.\u201dMaster Mao muttered to himself for a long time, but he still couldn\u2019t withstand Madam Lou\u2019s love for her son. He pointed to a baby-faced, long-haired girl and said, \u201cThis woman\u2019s fortune can resist Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirits if he wears his jade clasp.\u201dMadam Lou took a look and found it was Jiang Siqi, daughter of Jianghai Province\u2019s governor.\u201cIn other words, as long as Lou Ming\u2019s jade clasp is not removed, he can be with her normally?\u201d Madam Lou asked to confirm.\u201cWith the premise of Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirits not getting out of control.\u201d Master Mao made clear that it was still dangerous.\u201cI understand, thank you Master Mao.\u201d Madam Lou got the answer she wanted. She collected the photos on the table one by one and walked out with excitement.Behind her Master Mao sighed faintly. Madam Lou had given this matter a lot of thought, but how could Lou Ming easily agree with this? This child has long since evaluated himself properly.Madam Lou walked out from the temple and got inside the car. She took out Jiang Siqi\u2019s picture with a gratified smile on her face. Over the years, whenever Lou Ming had a video call with them, he would give one or two words of advice towards the junior members of the family, the fond gleam in his eyes couldn\u2019t be covered up.Lou Ming liked children and wished for a home of himself. Madam Lou wanted her little son to have the same warm home as ordinary people. He\u2019s such a good and kind person, why should he keep on passing the days like this? She wasn\u2019t reconciled and she didn\u2019t believe her son should live this way forever.That\u2019s why, over the years, Madam Lou mobilized all of her connections all over the country to search for qualified people, and these three were the most qualified ones she could find. Before coming to Master Mao, Madam Lou actually found someone to read these three girls\u2019 eight characters. Their fortunes were surely beyond doubt, but it\u2019s still not sure whether they can withstand Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirits, so she needed Master Mao\u2019s help to come to a conclusion.And today\u2026Madam Lou held Jiang Siqi\u2019s picture in one hand, turned her phone on with the other and dialed it, \u201cSiqi ah, I\u2019m your Aunt Lou, do you have time to come and have tea together today\u2026\u201dA week later, Lou Ming \u00a0was checking data for his new design in his study when he was suddenly interrupted by Cheng Peng.\u201cIs the little girl here?\u201d Today is the weekend. Chen Yu always comes over to draw talismans and rub for some auras every weekend, so Lou Ming naturally thought that it was Chen Yu.\u201cNo.\u201d Cheng Peng shook his head, his expression was a little weird as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a young lady named Jiang Siqi. She said she\u2019s here to give you something from Madam.\u201d\u201cJiang Siqi?\u201d Lou Ming frowned in surprise, \u201cPeople can\u2019t casually stay here in this courtyard, why didn\u2019t you guys not send her away after receiving the stuff?\u201d\u201cMinister Lou agreed to this, he said\u2026 this Miss Jiang won\u2019t be affected by your evil spirits.\u201d When Jiang Siqi arrived at the small courtyard, it was followed by Minister Lou\u2019s call.Lou Ming\u2019s expression turned strange in an instant, he hesitated for a while, put down the pen in his hand, and walked downstairs. When he saw the quiet girl sitting on the living room sofa, he couldn\u2019t help but slow down his steps.Jiang Siqi was carefully looking at the living room\u2019s furnishings when she heard footsteps on the stairs. She looked up with a lovely sweet smile on her face, \u201cYou should be Third Brother, I\u2019m Jiang Siqi.\u201dLou Ming walked slowly towards the pretty smiling girl. Although there\u2019s a surprise in his heart, he still had a polite slight smile on his face, \u201cHello, I\u2019m Lou Ming.\u201d\u201cI know, Aunt Lou told me about you, Third Brother, you\u2019re much more handsome than what Auntie said.\u201d When Jiang Siqi spoke, a slight pink blush appeared on her baby face matching the pink bolster that she clutched closely in her hands. She seemed even more beautiful.\u201cThank you.\u201d Lou Ming said gently, \u201cI heard my mother troubled you to send me something?\u201d\u201cNo, no, I happened to be passing by. I didn\u2019t go out of my way to deliver it, it\u2019s not troublesome at all.\u201d Jiang Siqi tried to explain, but the more she tried, the more conspicuous she was.\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous\u2026\u201d Lou Ming found it somewhat funny, \u201cMy mother must have asked you to send me something.\u201d\u201cOh, this.\u201d Jiang Siqi hurriedly picked up a black paper bag set to the side and handed it to Lou Ming.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He raised his eyebrows in surprise as he didn\u2019t understand why his mother asked a stranger to come to his courtyard only to give him a cashmere scarf.\u201cDo\u2026 do you like it?\u201d Jiang Siqi couldn\u2019t help but ask Lou Ming who was holding the scarf without saying anything.Lou Ming suddenly returned to his senses, \u201cOf course I like it, but I didn\u2019t know my mother could knit a scarf.\u201dLou Ming swept a glance at it and found that there were a few missing stitches on the dark-colored cashmere scarf, it\u2019s obvious it was handmade.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t made by Auntie.\u201d Jiang Siqi whispered in a low voice.Lou Ming\u2019s hand that was holding the scarf stiffened.\u201cI made it, the craftsmanship isn\u2019t very good.\u201d When the girl finished speaking, she lowered her head while her tender hands nervously pulled the edge of the pillow...Lou Ming\u2019s expression became grave in an instant. The scarf he was holding fell back into the paper bag. A smart person like Lou Ming, how could he not understand what his mother meant?He looked at JIang Siqi\u2019s bashful and nervous appearance. It was a scene that could only be found in television, Lou Ming never thought there would be a day when something like this happens to him.What\u2019s mother thinking? Did she forget about my special condition?At this moment, Chen Yu finally found an excuse to sneak out of her house. She ran quickly to the Lou\u2019s small courtyard and straight to the living room unimpeded.\u201cThird Brother, I\u2019m here!\u201d Chen Yu yelled happily when she saw Lou Ming.Seeing Chen Yu, Lou Ming\u2019s grave expression eased. Jiang Siqi also looked curiously, when she found a little girl who looked like a high schooler before her, she breathed out in relief.\u201cOh\u2026 it\u2019s rare for you to have a guest here.\u201d Chen Yu saw Jiang Siqi. Although Chen Yu wasn\u2019t an expert in seeing people\u2019s auras, Jiang Siqi\u2019s whole body was surrounded by a noble light violet aura letting her not be affected by the blood-red evil aura in the Lou\u2019s small courtyard. When Chen Yu saw this, her face instantly showed astonishment.\u201cHello, my name is Jiang Siqi.\u201d Seeing that Lou Ming and Chen Yu seemed to be familiar, Jiang Siqi took the initiative to say hello.\u201cMy name is Chen Yu.\u201d Chen Yu smiled and nodded, as her eyes wandered back and forth between Jiang Siqi and Lou Ming. Her eyes which seemed to see through everything made Jiang Siqi blush inexplicably.Lou Ming knocked on Chen Yu\u2019s head in a bad mood, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Go upstairs.\u201dChen Yu clutched her head and ran to the second floor. When she was halfway through, she suddenly turned her head, stuck her tongue out at Lou Ming and smiled, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a blind date? Even if you don't let me see, people would know you\u2019re on a blind date ah.\u201dAlthough Jiang Siqi knew her intention on coming here today, she also fell in love with this clean and elegant Third Young Master the moment she saw him. However, being suddenly provoked Jiang Siqi couldn\u2019t help but lower her head bashfully.The knot on Lou Ming\u2019s brows that had just relaxed immediately twisted again. However, a certain culprit shouted, turned, and ran away so quickly he was unable to get angry. Lou Ming\u2019s head got even bigger when he turned his face and saw the bashful Jiang Siqi. [T/N: headache]\u201cSorry.\u201d Lou Ming said as he returned the paper bag in his hand, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t receive this gift from Miss Jiang.\u201d\u201cW\u2026why? You don\u2019t like it?\u201d Jiang Siqi was baffled.\u201cMiss Jiang, I thought this was made by my mother at first\u2026 do you understand?\u201d Lou Ming hinted, trying not to let his words hurt the other party.\u201cI\u2026 understand.\u201d Jiang Siqi\u2019s face turned red for a moment and white the next moment. Finally, beads of tears fell down from her peach-blossom eyes. She gritted her teeth and grabbed the paper bag before she ran out from the living room.\u201cCheng Peng, send someone to escort Miss Jiang back.\u201dAfter Lou Ming gave his order, he turned around and threw the pink pillow on the sofa far away. He really didn\u2019t understand what his parents were doing. Giving their son a blind date? And then get him married?\u201cIf you don\u2019t like then you don\u2019t like, why are you smashing my pillow ah?\u201d Chen Yu leaned over the second-floor railing and complained about the unfairness her pillow received.\u201cDon\u2019t say nonsense.\u201d Lou Ming said in a bad mood.\u201cWhat nonsense am I talking about?\u201d Chen Yu thought for a while and said, \u201cThird Brother, don\u2019t you want to give it a thought? That young lady is very beautiful, and her aura is really good. If the evil aura in your body doesn\u2019t get worse, living with her isn\u2019t impossible ah.\u201d\u201cYour body contains evil spirits and your fate is the bane of other\u2019s existence. Only people with an extremely noble aura can be near you, but this kind of person is really rare in the world.\u201d Lou Ming suddenly remembered what Master Mao said to him more than 10 years ago.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t get worse? What if it gets worse then?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cThat\u2026 I don\u2019t know ah. How about you loosen the jade clasp the next time she comes and I\u2019ll help you to test it out.\u201d Chen Yu said.Lou Ming\u2019s eyes trembled, he looked at Chen Yu and asked in a deep voice, \u201cYou mean, she will be affected once I loosen the jade clasp?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Chen Yu said proudly, \u201cDo you think there are many great people like me in this world who don't fear your evil spirits?\u201dThe frown on Lou Ming\u2019s brows deepened at once.\u201cBut I\u2019m still a little bit happy that your blind date is unsuccessful.\u201d Chen Yu giggled.Lou Ming looked over in surprise.\u201cIf you get married, I won\u2019t be able to come here casually again ah, I have to avoid arousing suspicion.\u201d Chen Yu said in a serious manner.\u201cYou really understand a lot!\u201d Lou Ming simply felt angry but he also found it laughable.Author\u2019s NOTE:Xi Shi: You\u2019re not allowed to get married!Third Young Master: Why?Xi Shi: I still haven\u2019t forced a kiss on you ah\u2026TL NOTE:Heyo, wow, it has been a\u00a0very\u00a0long time eh?

So, when Master Mao saw Lou Ming\u2019s expression on the video call today, he guessed the reason why Lou Ming contacted him.\u201cSure enough, you tacitly consented to it?\u201d Lou Ming was somewhat speechless, \u201cI always thought that you were the person who understood me best.\u201d\u201cI understand your point, but I also understand your mother\u2019s.\u201d Master Mao sighed, \u201cMiss Jiang\u2019s fate is one in millions, Madam Lou must have gone through a lot of effort to find her.\u201d\u201cBut with my condition like this, wouldn\u2019t it only hold up others?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cIf Miss Jiang understands your condition and is still willing, it might not necessarily be a bad thing.\u201d Master Mao sighed, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t say these things, but I\u2019ve watched you for so many years through the harsh road, what you did, and what you had to endure\u2026 Lou Ming, you\u2019re worthy.\u201d\u201cMaster.\u201d Lou Ming asked, \u201cI want to ask if I take off the jade clasp, can the other party not be harmed?\u201d\u201cImpossible.\u201d Master Mao shook his head.\u201cThen\u2026 even if I don\u2019t take the jade clasp off, if one day the evil spirit in my body broke out again, can you be sure she will be fine?\u201d Lou Ming asked again.\u201cIt\u2019s also impossible.\u201d Master Mao continued to shake his head.\u201cThen, why do you say this might not necessarily be a bad thing?\u201d Lou Ming said, \u201cYou can\u2019t. Just because you think I\u2019m worthy, you\u2019re willing to sacrifice the life of an innocent girl.\u201d\u201cDo you remember what I asked you when I was young?\u201d Lou Ming continued, \u201cI asked you, Master Mao, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong, why did I become like this? Why would I hurt others even though I did nothing?\u201dMaster Mao sighed a long breath. How could he forget?\u201cYou couldn\u2019t answer. You could only deduce it was karma from the past.\u201d Lou Ming smiled bitterly, \u201cI thought back then, what did I do in my previous life that my present life is like this? I didn\u2019t understand it, no matter how hard I thought about it, so I gave up thinking about it.\u201d\u201cMiss Jiang\u2019s fate is one in millions, if there really is karma from the past, then her fate must have been cultivated from her previous life too. If I harm another\u2019s culmination of good karma for my own gain, I\u2019m afraid I would stay just like this in my next life.\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s voice was full of self-deprecation.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that.\u201d Master Mao explained, \u201cThese past few years your control over the evil spirit in your body is really good. Also, during this time, the evil spirit\u2019s growth has slowed down. If you pay careful attention, you won't hurt the Jiang family\u2019s miss. Because of this, I gave tacit approval to your mother.\u201d\u201cMaster Mao, I know you care about me, but\u2026 I hope when my mother comes to see you, you wouldn\u2019t help her with this again.\u201d Lou Ming requested, \u201cIf you really can\u2019t refuse, you should at least let me know.\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201d Master Mao felt quite ashamed as he hung up the phone.Lou Ming looked at the blank phone screen and was in a daze for a long time. He knew he should call his mother next, but he didn\u2019t know how to face his old mother.Lou Ming once saw a sentence on the internet, it said after living alone for a long time, one will gradually get used to that kind of life. Although Lou Ming had long been accustomed to this lonesome life, he was more eager for a life where he could interact with others, where he can meet face to face, touch other people and be touched. The kind of life where everyone can laugh together by telling a joke.Therefore, he felt unhappy during New Years and holidays, so he always insisted on making a phone call home.Although he never hugged any of the juniors in the family, he couldn\u2019t help saying a few words out of concern.He can even clearly remember the little girl he met by chance fifteen years ago.In his days of being alone, there were only a few people for him to remember so he can\u2019t bear to forget even one person.He always thought he was hiding his pain well, but he still couldn\u2019t hide it from his mother\u2019s eyes. His mother has been unyielding all her life. She followed his father from his turbulent years and now that the family has peace and wealth, Lou Ming became the only knot left in his mother\u2019s heart.Ding-a-ling~The phone rang abruptly, interrupting Lou Ming\u2019s thoughts. Looking at the name on the screen, Lou Ming hesitated for a while before reaching out to answer the phone.\u201cMing Ming\u2026\u201d Madam Lou\u2019s uneasy voice came through the phone. In fact, she had sent people to watch the small courtyard since Jiang Siqi entered. When Jiang Siqi ran out crying, Madam Lou waited for Lou Ming\u2019s call but Lou Ming didn\u2019t call her for quite a long time and she became too impatient to wait.\u201cMom.\u201d Lou Ming spoke with a complicated expression.\u201cAre you blaming Mom for acting on my own?\u201d Madam Lou asked.\u201cMom, you\u2026\u201d Lou Ming said helplessly, \u201cDon\u2019t do this next time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not okay? Is it that you don\u2019t like Miss Jiang? If so, Mom can find others\u2026\u201d\u201cMom, you know that\u2019s not what I mean.\u201d Lou Ming sighed, \u201cYou know my situation best. I believe Master Mao also told you the so-called people with an extremely noble aura can only bear my evil spirit from a certain distance, they can\u2019t live a normal life together with me.\u201d\u201cBut Master Mao said the evil spirit has been very stable so that there won\u2019t be any big problem.\u201d Madam Lou emphasized.\u201cBut I still can\u2019t leave the small courtyard casually or go in a crowd. When I go to the Academy of Science in the dead of the night, I have to make a trip to Xiaohan Mountain and close the road for half a night.\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t mind?\u201d Madam Lou asked.\u201cMom, it\u2019s not fair.\u201d Lou Ming sighed, \u201cMoreover, it also makes me feel like some kind of charity case.\u201d\u201cHow can it be a charity case, ah?\u201d Madam Lou was annoyed, \u201cOur family won\u2019t treat her badly.\u201d\u201cMom, I\u2019m always telling myself I live a very meaningful life that I\u2019m not the least bit pitiful.\u201d Lou Ming said with difficulty, \u201cYou\u2019re going to make me feel pitiful if you\u2019re like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d There was no sound from the phone, but Lou Ming knew his mother must be sad. Lou Ming\u2019s fingers trembled slightly while holding the phone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At that time, no matter if you damage your body, you still stuck a Calming Spirit Talisman and came for a look.\u201d [T/N: I\u2019m not quite sure with my translation in this sentence] Madam Lou said with difficulty, \u201cMother is just thinking, if I explain everything clearly to Jiang Siqi and if she\u2019s still willing, then why don\u2019t you try? Even just having a child is okay, ah.\u201d\u201cMom!\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s voice revealed a deep pain, his fingertips holding the phone were white because of the force he exerted.\u201cYou think about it again, Mother will hang up first.\u201dListening to the busy tone on the phone, Lou Ming\u2019s expression was complicated and painfully sad. He didn\u2019t know how to comfort his broken-hearted mother, nor could he hurt Jiang Siqi.\u201cClack\u2026\u201dThe sudden sound made Lou Ming jerk back. He frowned as he watched potato chips rolling in from outside the door then half the head and the frowning eyebrows of an embarrassed girl peeked through.\u201cIf I say\u2026 that I just came here, do you believe me?\u201d Chen Yu asked cautiously, showing her head from outside the door.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Lou Ming asked rhetorically.\u201cThen I won\u2019t explain it.\u201d Chen Yu saw that her beating around the bush wouldn't pass, so she simply squatted on the ground and picked up the fallen chips.\u201c\u2026\u201d this little girl really broke the jar, Lou Ming found it irritating but also funny, \u201cIt\u2019s already fallen, don\u2019t pick it up to eat again.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, the floor is so clean, I can eat it once I pick it up.\u201d Chen Yu said indifferently, \u201cBesides, a couple of germs won\u2019t do me any harm.\u201dLou Ming didn\u2019t say anything further when she said that. Chen Yu\u2019s sudden appearance dilutes his sadness from talking with Madam Lou. Lou Ming put down the phone, looked at the half-drawn blueprint on the table, and picked up a pen to continue drawing.Chen Yu picked up all the potato chips on the ground one by one then went out to find a broom to sweep away some fine debris on the ground. Seeing that everything was more or less done, she walked to Lou Ming\u2019s desk while holding her picked up potato chips. She looked at the blueprint and asked in surprise, \u201cIs this a rifle?\u201dLou Ming raised his head in surprise, \u201cYou haven\u2019t gone out yet?\u201d\u201cThird Brother, are you angry?\u201d Chen Yu asked cautiously.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lou Ming really was disinclined to fuss about one little girl, it wasn\u2019t a big matter but it\u2019s just a bit embarrassing, \u201cDon\u2019t do this again.\u201d\u201cEn, en, I promise, if I accidentally hear it again in the future, I will turn my head and leave.\u201d Chen Yu vowed solemnly.\u201cSo, you eavesdropped on purpose just now?\u201d Lou Min laughed in a bit of anger.\u201cThird brother, haven\u2019t you guessed it already?\u201d Chen Yu covered her mouth in horror, \u201cYou tricked me!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lou Ming suddenly felt rather stifled, he didn\u2019t want to talk anymore so he just bent his head and continued calculating datas.After a while had passed, Chen Yu suddenly called out again, \u201cThird Brother\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Seeing that she delayed and didn\u2019t leave, Lou Ming guessed Chen Yu had something she wanted to say with him.\u201cI have a very powerful grandfather; he was the one who taught me all my skills. Although he\u2019s sometimes very unreliable, his skills are undoubtedly good.\u201d Chen Yu said all of a sudden.\u201cI know ah.\u201d Lou Ming was a bit astonished, \u201cYou told me before.\u201d\u201cSometime ago, my grandpa suddenly contacted me. He gave me the way to deal with the living dead.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cBut I only have my grandpa\u2019s penguin number, I don\u2019t know why he keeps on not giving me his number.\u201d Chen Yu was vexed, \u201cBut I left a message for him.\u201d\u201cLeft a message?\u201d Lou Ming looked at Chen Yu suspiciously.\u201cI left a message asking my grandpa to see if there\u2019s any way to solve the evil spirit in Third Brother\u2019s body.\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cI have never forgotten the things I promised Third Brother.\u201dLou Ming was taken aback for a moment. He didn\u2019t expect Chen Yu to mention this out of nowhere, but he nodded happily, \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cSo, Third Brother\u2026\u201d Chen Yu remembered what she overheard, \u201cDo you want to try and be in contact with the sister who has the noble aura now?\u201dLou Ming\u2019s expression became stiff. It took him a while before he said, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything until the evil spirit is completely resolved. I can\u2019t hurt Miss Jiang, nor can I give my mother groundless hope.\u201d\u201cThen, Third Brother, how about you?\u201d Chen Yu asked with her eyes wide open, \u201cYou neither want to hurt the sister nor your mother. Everyone is worried about you but you\u2019re not worried about yourself.\u201dLou Ming\u2019s hands trembled and the pen he held snapped off, leaving a black mark on the manuscript paper.\u201cSure enough, you still have to rely on me!\u201dLou Ming jerked his head up.\u201cWho told me to overhear you just now?\u201d Chen Yu smiled, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of your evil spirit. I will definitely think of a way.\u201dLou Ming\u2019s heart warmed up and he smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t talk big, what if you can\u2019t solve it?\u201d\u201cHuh??\u201d Chen Yu said while eating chips, \u201cThird Brother\u2019s mother wants Third Brother to have a blind date. She definitely doesn\u2019t want Third Brother to be alone. If I can\u2019t solve the evil spirit, then I\u2019m just gonna stay with Third Brother, ah, I won\u2019t let Third Brother be by himself.\u201d\u201cStupid girl.\u201d Lou Ming flicked his fingers on Chen Yu\u2019s forehead with a warm smile in his eyes.Author\u2019s NOTE:Third Young Master: So, you\u2019ll stay with me?Xi Shi: I\u2019ll stay.Third Young Master: Alright.Xishi:\u00a0I feel like something\u2019s not right\u2026TL NOTE:I need some insulin right now.

The nation\u2019s Academy of Science\u2019s special scholar.Lou Ming nodded and followed the middle-aged man forward with a glimmer of anticipation in his eyes.\u201cThe thing was shipped to Imperial city this afternoon.\u201d The middle-aged man named Liu Mu was also a weapon expert in the Ministry of National Defense. He walked as he gave Lou Ming an introduction, \u201cThis weapon was excavated in Nanling a month ago by a group of archaeologists.\u201d\u201cNanling? During the Warring States Period there was a boundary between the Kingdom of Qiyang and Fengyu there.\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Liu Mu continued, \u201cProfessor Fang of the archaeological team said the tomb probably belonged to a Qiyang general during the Warring States Period; there are a large number of weapons from that era inside the tomb. The copper sword that\u2019s in the research room now was found inside the tomb owner\u2019s coffin.\u201d\u201cIn the test results report you gave me, it\u2019s mentioned you detected a strange energy from this bronze sword.\u201d Lou Ming had received a report from the Ministry of National Defense in the afternoon. The report said there should only be one cold-steel weapon emitting a strange heat energy.If this weapon really possessed a strange energy, then it would be a big breakthrough in the history of weapon production. Lou Ming was very interested in this, so he rushed excitedly that night.\u201cYes.\u201d Liu Mu said, \u201cAfter testing, we found the energy is not emitting radiation. We monitored the energy\u2019s waves and found the source comes from a strange totem on the hilt, but we really can\u2019t figure out how this energy and weapon merge or how it\u2019s applied.\u201dThe two of them walked to Lou Ming\u2019s private research room, it\u2019s a fully transparent room made of bullet-proof glass. Because of his physique, it\u2019s impossible to keep people around when Lou Ming is conducting his research. The Ministry made this room because they didn\u2019t want people outside the research room to notice anything if something happened with Lou Ming inside the room. [Ed: Then why did they build a glass room?] [T/N: Lol, Ikr?]Before he entered the room, Lou Ming saw the dark bronze sword through the glass.\u201cDirector Liu, if I don\u2019t come out in two hours, you shouldn\u2019t let people be near here.\u201d Lou Ming reminded Liu Mu.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Liu Mu smiled and nodded. Lou Ming always did this when he came to the National Academy of Sciences; if he stayed inside the room for more than two hours it would mean he encountered a problem and needed more time to overcome it. During this time, no one was allowed to pass within a five-meter range of Lou Ming\u2019s research room.Liu Mu waited until Lou Ming entered the research room and began to study the bronze sword, before he turned around and left the room completely to Lou Ming and his guards.The moment Lou Ming stepped into the research room, a strange feeling suddenly rose in his heart. It wasn\u2019t until he raised his hand to touch the bronze sword that the strange feeling gradually became distinct as it changed into a kind of\u2026 closeness and familiarity.\u201cSwish!\u201dLou Ming was shocked, he retracted his hand and looked at the two-palm sized bronze sword that had suddenly shrunk into the size of half a palm.\u201cBuzz, buzz, buzz!\u201dThe half-palm sized bronze sword kept vibrating on the table, as if it was calling Lou Ming.Lou Ming hesitated, raised his hands and picked up the shrunken bronze sword, holding it in his palm and looking at it carefully.- Earlier in the day -Chen Yu had no classes on this sunny afternoon, she carried a newly bought backpack while walking out with roller skates.\u201cShishi, you really won\u2019t go shopping with us on the weekend, ah?\u201d Fang Feifei shouted to Chen Yu who was about to leave the dormitory.\u201cSorry, I really have something to do this weekend. I\u2019ll join you guys next time. By the way\u2026\u201d Chen Yu ran back to her desk, pulled out a silver card from the drawer and handed it to Fang Feifei, \u201cVK\u2019s VIP card, you can use it if you want to buy clothes.\u201dTong Chao had given her this VK VIP card. When Chen Yu returned to school after solving the living dead case, her roommates pestered her about why her appearance didn\u2019t change at all even though she was gone for two days. Chen Yu used this card to trick them. She lied that Tong Chao had something to do and had to go abroad temporarily so he gave her this VIP card as compensation. By chance, there was a fashion week being held at the same time [T/N: as when living dead attacked], so Chen Yu managed to bluff her way out.\u201cYou haven\u2019t used this card once since you got it.\u201d Han You said.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, anyway, this card has no expiration date, so it doesn\u2019t matter when it\u2019s used.\u201d Chen Yu said while opening the dormitory door again, \u201cI\u2019m leaving, see you on Monday.\u201dChen Yu left the dormitory\u2019s door, pushed off on the newly bought roller skates under her feet and swiftly moved forward on the school\u2019s boulevard in a cool and swift manner.She was busy with upgrading her account in the Spiritual Website, ah.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

[T/N: the penguin group of exorcists called Gods and Ghosts Don't Ask]I Want to Fix Road: \u2018Why? Didn\u2019t you say that as long as I send you the task\u2019s content, you will give me the involved person\u2019s contact information?\u2019Spiritual Programmer: \u2018Yes, but that service is only limited to tasks worth less than one million, if it is a bigger amount, please be aware and go to the website to take the task directly.\u2019I Want to Fix Road: \u2018Is there any difference?\u2019Spiritual Programmer: \u2018In addition to tax avoidance, the purpose of this group is to help weak exorcists. A celestial master who has the ability to accept a five-million-yuan task can deduct the handling fee through the website themselves, there\u2019s no need to come here.\u2019There were two methods to pay the handling fee on the Spiritual Website. One is to directly deduct 30% from the task reward, while the other one is to complete one level A task published by the website every month to deduct all handling fees.Chen Yu said with a bit of heartache: \u2018But, even if a level A task is completed, that's still several millions, ah.\u2019 [T/N: I\u2019m not so sure what she meant.]Spiritual Programmer: \u2018Master, ah, our group is doing the task of picking up people secretly, we can\u2019t be too aggressive, ah.\u2019I Want to Fix Road: \u2026Chen Yu had no choice but to honestly accept tasks right from the Spiritual Website only to find out the tasks had to be in line with one\u2019s rank, so an exorcist who uses the second method to waive the handling fee must be a rank A account.Therefore, Chen Yu must start from the lowest level starting from accepting tasks worth tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan in order to slowly level up. During this period of time Chen Yu was very busy; although these tasks weren\u2019t worth much money there were still a lot of people who coveted them.After all, there weren\u2019t many special tasks that can ignore one\u2019s rank like the living dead case, ah. If there were any, Chen Yu would definitely pick them up because she could directly upgrade to A rank after completing three special missions.Today, Chen Yu took on a small task worth 30 thousand yuan and only got a little more than 20 thousand yuan after the handling fee was deducted. However, Chen Yu wouldn\u2019t disdain however small the amount was, it\u2019s better to have money than no income at all, not to mention this situation can be upgraded quickly.\u201cAre you a Celestial Master?\u201d The client was a young man in his twenties, he was surprised when he saw Chen Yu. Obviously, he didn\u2019t believe that Chen Yu was a Celestial Master with real skills.Chen Yu glanced at the man\u2019s shoulder; a female ghost with a blurry face was lying on it, she was licking the man\u2019s face and ears with her tongue, it was very nauseating.\u201cI\u2019m a Celestial Master.\u201d It\u2019s not the first time Chen Yu was asked this question; she really didn\u2019t want to explain more. Anyway, after the matter has been dealt with and the money transferred to her account, they won\u2019t meet again in the future.\u201cYou\u2019re making people laugh, ah, you\u2019re clearly just a student, how can a Celestial Master look like you\u2026\u201d The man obviously didn\u2019t believe her. Just as he was about to make a phone call to complain, Chen Yu came over and patted him on the shoulder.The man took an uncomfortable step back. Soon after that, he felt the invisible sticky sensation suddenly disappear, he unconsciously reached out and touched his cheek and ears.\u201cAs stated in the task, you feel cold and sticky on your cheeks and ears, as if something is licking you. When you go to bed at night, you always feel that someone is around you\u2026\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cThese symptoms will disappear from now on, you should already feel the change. When you go to bed at night, if everything is normal, please confirm the order so I can settle the accounts.\u201d\u201cWait, wait\u2026\u201d The man saw Chen Yu pat his shoulder and was about to leave, he couldn\u2019t help but shout, \u201cYou\u2026 you have to tell me what happened to me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yu glanced at the female ghost who was obediently following beside her, then glanced at the man and asked, \u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d the man nodded.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll help ask for you.\u201d Chen Yu turned to look at the female ghost under the man\u2019s horrified gaze.\u201cHe\u2019s handsome!\u201d The female ghost said with a smile.Chen Yu calmly looked up and recounted, \u201cYou\u2019re entangled with a perverted female ghost, she thinks you\u2019re handsome so she deliberately takes advantage of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The man\u2019s whole face suddenly changed like burnt ashes. He wished to go home and take a bath over and over again.Chen Yu stopped paying attention to the man, took the female ghost to a secluded place and scolded her, \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to take advantage of others in the future, got it?\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, okay.\u201d The female ghost nodded hurriedly.\u201cIf I catch you again, I\u2019ll exorcise you.\u201d Chen Yu threatened.The female ghost felt it was unbelievable and asked, \u201cCelestial Master, you won\u2019t\u2026 exorcise me now?\u201d\u201cDo you want me to?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cDon\u2019t want.\u201d The female ghost quickly shook her head.\u201cThen you should stop making trouble. I've caught a lot of ghosts, but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen a perverted female ghost so I\u2019ll let you off for now.\u201d\u00a0Sending a spirit to the underworld uses a lot of spiritual energy, ah, how could a 30-thousand-yuan task be worthy of such a service?\u201cHehe\u2026 actually, I was too shy when I was alive, I\u2019m also someone who loves good looks, so I would start imagining things whenever I saw a handsome brother. Later\u2026 hehe\u2026 I found out I can take advantage of my situation to do whatever I want, so\u2026\u201d The female ghost spoke with a shy look.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chen Yu just wanted to scold this female ghost some more but was suddenly interrupted by her phone ringing.Chen Yu took out the phone and saw it was an unknown number. After thinking for a while, she answered.\u201cMiss Chen Yu, where are you now?\u201d\u201cAssistant He?\u201d Chen Yu asked in surprise.\u201cSomething happened to the Third Young Master!\u201dAuthor\u2019s NOTE:Xi Shi: I\u2019ll save you right away!PR: ChaiNotTeaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When He Qi called, Chen Yu reported her location. Cheng Peng drove over in less than five minutes and she quickly arrived at the university\u2019s location.There was no time for Cheng Peng to greet her, Chen Yu pulled open the door and got into the car.Cheng Peng stepped on the gas and quickly made a 180 turn, speeding towards the direction of National Academy of Sciences amidst the sound of curses and car horns.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Third Brother?\u201d He Qi didn\u2019t make it clear on the phone just now, so Chen Yu asked with a worried face.\u201cI\u2019m also not very clear on the situation, just that an evil spirit suddenly broke out.\u201d When the word \u2018broke out\u2019 was mentioned, Cheng Peng\u2019s pupils unconsciously shrank all of a sudden.[I\u2019ll have to trouble you if one day my evil spirit breaks out.] Lou Ming\u2019s words were still in his ears, but even though they were people who regarded obeying orders as their bound duty, none of them were willing to execute this order.\u201cBroke out? How did it happen so suddenly?\u201d Although Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit was a grave matter, the jade clasp seal on his body was very strong. Moreover, he just absorbed some auspicious aura three months ago to ward off evil and released evil energy at Xiaohan Mountain two months ago. During this period of time, Chen Yu had also absorbed some of his evil energy to make a Profound Strike Talisman. For these reasons, Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit should be in an unprecedented stable condition, so how could there be a sudden break out, Chen Yu remained perplexed despite much thought.\u201cIt seems to be related to the antique bronze sword.\u201d Cheng Peng only knew this much.\u201cAntique? Was it just unearthed?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Cheng Peng asked in surprise.\u201cArtifacts that have just been unearthed mostly bring evil spirit with them.\u201d Chen Yu frowned, \u201cHow can this kind of thing appear next to Third Brother?\u201d\u201cMaster Mao said that a common evil spirit wouldn\u2019t affect the Third Young Master.\u201d Cheng Peng said.\u201cIf it\u2019s there are common ones, ah, of course there are special ones.\u201d They hadn\u2019t reached Imperial University yet, but Chen Yu could almost guess what\u2019s going on. Chen Yu flipped through her backpack to find there were only a few charms along with her compass.\u201cIs there a solution?\u201d Cheng Peng asked excitedly.\u201cIt depends on the situation, I can\u2019t be sure yet.\u201d If this thing can break out Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit in an instant, then this thing must be an extraordinary one. Chen Yu\u2019s current strength couldn\u2019t even suppress the evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body so how would she dare to guarantee anything? Although she didn\u2019t know what situation she would face next, she couldn\u2019t ignore it if Lou Ming met with an accident.Cheng Peng stepped on the brakes, turned around and looked at Chen Yu pleadingly, \u201cMiss Chen Yu, please help Third Young Master.\u201d\u201cNonsense, I don\u2019t need you to talk about it.\u201d Chen Yu didn\u2019t have the time to answer him as she pushed the door and ran outside.Tian Fei was waiting for her at the gate, he greeted her as soon as he saw Chen Yu running over, \u201cMiss Chen Yu, this way\u2026\u201dChen Yu followed Tian Fei with Cheng Peng following closely behind them.\u201cHow\u2019s the situation?\u201d Cheng Peng asked Tian Fei.\u201cMaster Mao said he can\u2019t do anything for the time being.\u201d Tian Fei replied.\u201cDoes Minister Lou know?\u201d Cheng Peng asked with some worry.The command to eliminate Lou Ming if the evil spirit broke out was only known to Lou Ming and Minister Lou. If Minister Lou already knew, then Third Young Master\u2026\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know for the time being, people from the Ministry of National Defense wanted to make the call, but they were blocked by Leader He.\u201c Tian Fei thought of the scene and felt a cold sweat forming on his forehead; if they had made the call then how should they choose between obeying or disobeying the order of eliminating Third Young Master? How should they deal with punishment by martial law, ah?Although Chen Yu didn\u2019t understand it clearly, she understood Third Brother was in a dangerous situation now.The three of them passed through more than a dozen checkpoints until they finally saw He Qi\u2019s figure from a distance.\u201cAssistant He, I\u2019m going in again.\u201d Master Mao said to He Qi who was standing at the door.\u201cTeacher, you can\u2019t, weren\u2019t you just injured now?\u201d Lin Gui, Master Mao\u2019s eldest disciple, stopped him.\u201cOnce the evil spirit broke out, Lou Ming thoroughly lost his reason.\u201d Master Mao can\u2019t remain indifferent.\u201cBut Third Young Master wouldn\u2019t want to see something happen to you.\u201d Lin Gui continued trying to stop him.Master Mao entered the research room and wanted to forcibly seal the evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body, however, anyone who entered within one meter radius of Lou Ming was hit by the black-colored copper sword. It immediately removed the protection power Master Mao had set up on his body before entering the room.Master Mao was weakened by the evil spirit and could only run out while spurting a mouthful of blood.As Master Mao and Lin Gui chatted, He Qi couldn\u2019t decide what was the best course to take when he suddenly heard rapidly approaching footsteps.\u201cMiss Chen Yu!\u201d He Qi\u2019s eyes lit up.Chen Yu swept a glance towards the research room, Lou Ming was standing quietly in the middle of it with his back facing everyone, as if nothing unusual had happened. Chen Yu immediately pointed to the space between her eyebrows, unsealing her yin yang eyes to look again, and the clear research room was instantly covered in a blood red color.The thick and strong evil aura was like a pool of blood surging inside a huge glass jar. The more Chen Yu looked, the worse her face became.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, the evil spirit slowed down a lot after being suppressed by the auspicious aura three months ago. I\u2019ll go in to check on the situation.\u201d Chen Yu spoke as she was about to enter.The five assistants who were guarding the door stepped aside immediately, one of them even reached out to open the door for Chen Yu.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Chen Yu.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Master Mao.Chen Yu looked back at Master Mao in surprise while Master Mao was also measuring Chen Yu.\u201cLittle girl, you can\u2019t enter so casually.\u201d Master Mao naturally saw that Chen Yu was also a celestial master, but how could her cultivation base withstand such a strong evil spirit? Master Mao couldn\u2019t help but remind her.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Chen Yu smiled and turned to the assistant who tried to open the door for her, \u201cYou should stay away, be careful or you can get corroded by the evil spirit leaking from the door.\u201dSeveral assistants looked at each other and they all took a step back.Their movements made Master Mao frown. The assistants who followed Lou Ming would ignore everyone except for Lou Ming and Minister Lou on normal days.\u201cGirl.\u201d Master Mao saw that Chen Yu was about to go in, so he reminded her again, \u201cBe careful of the bronze sword.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu took out a Profound Strike Talisman and stuck it to the door as she opened it. The talisman absorbed the evil spirit that leaked from the crack of the door, preventing it from spreading out.Chen Yu entered the research room in a flash.Everyone\u2019s gazes were locked on the two people in the research room.As soon as Chen Yu stepped in the room, her compass began to vibrate uneasily, making Chen Yu\u2019s grip unsteady.Chen Yu looked around for a while and saw there was no immediate danger so she quickly walked to Lou Ming, wanting to see what happened to him up close.Swish!A black bronze sword flew towards Chen Yu as she approached Lou Ming. Fortunately, with Master Mao's reminder, Chen Yu was prepared and dexterously avoided the attack.The bronze sword only pierced empty air before it circled around and flew over with a faster speed.Swish, swish, swish!Three times in a row with each time being faster than before. At the last moment the bronze sword grazed Chen Yu\u2019s head, chopping off her ponytail and her long black hair fell to the ground.Chen Yu\u2019s expression changed. When the bronze sword attacked again, she threw the compass in her hand at it.Clank!The sound of metal colliding rang out as the bronze sword and the compass fought in the air. Their speed was getting faster and faster and eventually became afterimages.This supernatural scene stupefied all the ordinary people outside who only believed in science.Chen Yu used the time to run to Lou Ming\u2019s side, she grabbed his arm and shouted, \u201cThird Brother, Third Brother\u2026\u201dLou Ming\u2019s hands were tightly grabbing the desk, blue veins almost bursting out from the back of his hands. He turned his head laboriously to look at Chen Yu with scarlet eyes. His mouth moved but there was no sound coming out.He still has his rationality; Chen Yu was happy.Chen Yu took out the two remaining Profound Strike Talisman and directly attached them to Lou Ming\u2019s body. The talismans absorbed the evil spirit in the air before they exploded in a green flame and turned into ashes.The evil spirit exploded the talismans.\u201cGet\u2026 out!\u201d Lou Ming who regained a trace of strength back with the help of those talismans, said with difficulty.\u201cThird brother!\u201d Chen Yu looked up with pleasant surprise.\u201cHe Qi\u2026 let him\u2026 gun\u2026\u201d Lou Ming tried to say something, but it\u2019s a pity that Chen Yu failed to understand it.Chen Yu lowered her head to check the jade clasp on Lou Ming\u2019s wrist only to find that it had already cracked and fell on the table. She frowned, the jade clasp was broken, how could it seal the evil spirit anymore?Clang! Clang! Clang!The bronze sword saw Chen Yu approaching Lou Ming and it became extremely anxious, its attack speed became all the more violent, but it couldn\u2019t break the compass\u2019 defense.\u201cBuzz, buzz, buzz!\u201dThe compass buzzed and vibrated as it fought.\u201cAish, I\u2019m still thinking of a way, ah. Hold it back a bit more.\u201d Sensing the compass\u2019 urgency, Chen Yu impatiently howled back at it.\u201cBuzz, buzz, buzz!\u201d\u201cI know your spiritual power isn\u2019t enough, I\u2019ll let you stay in Third Brother\u2019s house for a week after we get back.\u201dOnce the compass heard her words that it could stay at the Lou\u2019s small courtyard for a week, it immediately flew up happily, and exerted the little energy it had collected to fight the bronze sword.Woooo\u2026\u00a0The bronze sword trembled for a while and began to absorb the evil spirit in the air.Chen Yu noticed this and couldn\u2019t help but burst out swearing. With some heartache, she took out a high-grade defensive talisman the old man had drawn and swatted it towards the bronze sword.The sword paused and then pierced the defensive talisman with a buzzing sound. The talisman spontaneously ignited with a burst of strong spiritual power and repelled the sword back half a meter.At the same time in a certain internet caf\u00e9, Wu Lao\u2019s hand that was holding a mouse suddenly paused. He decisively put aside his game character that was in a boss fight, and took out his cell phone to call Chen Yu.(Shit, brother, you lost connection? You\u2019re gonna wipe out the entire group, ah!!)Ding-a-ling\u2026Chen Yu answered the phone at lighting speed, \u201cOld man.\u201d\u201cWhat have you encountered?\u201d Wu Lao asked worriedly.\u201cOld man, an evil spirit, a stronger evil spirit than all the zombies that I have seen before, how do I seal it, ah?!\u201d Chen Yu asked with full anxiety.\u201cEven stronger than the one I took you to see when you were ten?\u201d The old man frowned, that was a thousand-year-old zombie, ah.\u201cMore powerful than that!\u201d Chen Yu affirmed.\u201cThen what are you waiting for? Run, ah!\u201d the old man cursed, \u201cHow can you take on this kind of big dumpling? Run, quickly!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t run!\u201d Chen Yu anxiously said.\u201cThen, there\u2019s only one method left!\u201d the old man thought since Chen Yu can\u2019t run away so he worriedly said, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a bit\u2026 but it can save life.\u201d\u201cWhat method?\u201d Chen Yu asked without any hesitation.As soon as the old man finished speaking, Chen Yu threw her phone away and under everyone\u2019s horrified gazes she pulled Lou Ming\u2019s neck down to kiss him while standing on her tiptoes!\u201cHa??????\u201dAll of Lou Ming\u2019s assistants took a sharp breath!Author\u2019s NOTE:Assistants: This girl, as expected, she has been coveting our Third Young Master for a long time\u2026TL NOTE:Kya!

A cold aura suddenly engulfed everything, soaking all of Chen Yu\u2019s limbs and bones. Chen Yu knew her own spiritual energy mixed with Lou Ming\u2019s.Absorb!Chen Yu closed her eyes and started a method to absorb spiritual energy, just like those Taoists that practiced asceticism in the past. She took in all the evil spirit that had been released out.Most people outside the research room only saw Chen Yu suddenly hugging and kissing Third Young Master Lou, but in Master Mao and Lin Gui\u2019s eyes the once bloody red room was like a pool that had its drainage hole opened. The blood red evil spirits furiously rushed towards Lou Ming\u2019s body and disappeared from the room in less than three minutes.As the violent evil spirits entered Lou Ming\u2019s body, the situation became more stable. Afterwards, the evil spirits searched for Chen Yu and Lou Ming\u2019s linked aura and slowly came pouring into Chen Yu.While Chen Yu passively absorbed the evil spirit from Lou Ming, what sounded in her mind was the old man\u2019s instructions on the phone.\u201cYou have a special constitution so you are naturally not afraid of evil spirits. After you kiss him, pull the evil spirits from him through your mouth and seal them with a Spirit Inducing Seal.\u201dSpirit Inducing Seal was Luoshan Sect\u2019s unique spell. It uses spiritual power to mix with a person\u2019s aura while they draw sealing incantations in the air to perform the seal. It can 100 percent seal the evil spirit inside one\u2019s body instantly.Chen Yu was still clinging to Lou Ming\u2019s neck with one hand while her other hand was drawing incantations. This was Chen Yu's first time drawing a sealing incantation so her speed was somewhat slow, but fortunately her aura already mixed with Lou Ming\u2019s, so although the drawing process wasn\u2019t that smooth, the effect was still obvious.The moment when the sealing charm was fully formed, Chen Yu turned her finger and the charm turned into a golden light that fell on Lou Ming.The evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body suddenly stopped, Chen Yu took this opportunity to let go and took a step back, cutting off the joined aura between the two.Bump!Lou Ming fell suddenly to the floor startling Chen Yu. She quickly squatted down to check and found Lou Ming unconscious. The moment Lou Ming fell, the bronze sword that had been fighting with the compass also fell down with a \u2018clang\u2019.\u201cThird Brother!\u201d Chen Yu tried to help Lou Ming up only to find out she wasn\u2019t strong enough so she had to call for someone outside, \u201cCome here, help!\u201dLou Ming\u2019s assistants who were guarding the door pushed it open and ran inside.Master Mao also followed. He first checked Lou Ming\u2019s condition to find Lou Ming was unconscious but there were no other problems so he finally felt relieved enough to let the assistants help Lou Ming.After a while everyone finally returned to the small courtyard.After examining the changes in Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit, Master Mao left the bedroom to walk downstairs while explaining to He Qi, \u201cLou Ming is unconscious because of the shock from the evil spirit\u2019s attack, he should wake up after a moment\u2019s rest.\u201d\u201cThird Young Master\u2019s jade clasp was broken.\u201d He Qi nodded and handed the jade clasp he had picked up to Master Mao.\u201cThe evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body is now completely sealed, which is even better than the effect of this jade clasp. If the seal in Lou Ming\u2019s body isn\u2019t unlocked then the jade clasp isn\u2019t needed.\u201d As Master Mao said this, he couldn't help sweeping a glance at the second-floor room, \u201cWho is this little girl? Her ability is very special. If my guess is correct, she can completely subdue the evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body.\u201dHe Qi looked at Master Mao\u2019s inquiring gaze, hesitated a bit and then said, \u201cMaster Mao, can you please keep the matter of Miss Chen Yu a secret for the time being?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Master Mao was puzzled.\u201cMiss Chen Yu has been by Third Young Master\u2019s side for a while, during this time the evil spirit\u2019s stability was also thanks to Miss Chen Yu.\u201d He Qi explained, \u201cBut\u2026 Third Young Master doesn\u2019t want Minister Lou and Madam to know about this matter.\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for Lou Ming\u2019s prior instructions, Minister Lou would have long been notified of Chen Yu\u2019s appearance as soon as He Qi and the others knew of Chen Yu\u2019s ability to subdue the evil spirit.\u201cWhy?\u201d Master Mao was even more puzzled, \u201cIf there\u2019s a better way to control the evil spirit inside Lou Ming, why not tell Minister Lou?\u201d\u201cThird Young Master does not wish to ruin Miss Chen Yu\u2019s current life.\u201d He Qi answered.Master Mao was taken aback for a moment, but he quickly thought of all the things Minister and Madam Lou had done for Lou Ming over the years and suddenly realized something. If Minister Lou knew about Chen Yu\u2019s special ability, he estimated the little girl would be connected with the Lou family for the rest of her life.\u201cMiss Chen Yu has been thinking of ways to help Third Young Master, it doesn\u2019t change anything even if she said it or not. Master Mao, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d [T/N: I\u2019m not sure with my tl in this sentence] He Qi\u2019s meaning was obvious, since Chen Yu was already helping Third Young Master, then don\u2019t ruin the outcome by adding something superfluous and causing more trouble for her.Master Mao sighed, nodded and said, \u201cHowever, I still need to talk with this little girl.\u201dNot long after he chatted with He Qi, Chen Yu ran downstairs with ragged hair. She looked curiously at Master Mao who was sitting on the living room sofa and smiled, \u201cI know you, Third Brother talked about you with me.\u201d\u201cYou have a good relationship with Lou Ming?\u201d Master Mao asked in surprise. Their relationship is so good that Lou Ming specifically mentioned me?\u201cOf course.\u201d\u00a0We\u2019re good partners working together to make a fortune.Master Mao laughed and said, \u201cLittle girl, are you an exorcist from the Luoshan sect?\u201dChen Yu blinked and said in a puzzle, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m an exorcist, but I\u2019m not from the Luoshan sect.\u201d\u201cNo? Then who did you learn your technique from?\u201d Master Mao couldn\u2019t help asking after noticing that Chen Yu doesn\u2019t seem to be playing tricks.\u201cI learned it from my grandfather.\u201d Chen Yu answered.\u201cWho is your grandfather?\u201d Master Mao\u2019s mind turned around; he had never heard of a well-known great exorcist with the Chen surname.\u201cMy grandpa\u2019s name is Wu Li, he\u2019s also an exorcist.\u201d Chen Yu replied, \u201cI\u2019ve been learning exorcism from my grandpa since I was a child.\u201d [T/N: Lol, I was wrong all this time and thought his name was Wu Lao = Old Wu = Wu Li, I\u2019ll change it from here on.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At least among the famous masters, he had never heard of such a person.\u201cThen, where\u2019s your grandfather now?\u201d Master Mao couldn\u2019t help but curiously ask.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Chen Yu shook her head, \u201cHe has gone to travel around, I don\u2019t know where he is right now.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 have you ever asked him about Lou Ming\u2019s condition?\u201d Master Mao was thinking of going to visit him in person, but had to step back and ask instead.\u201cNot yet\u2026\u201d Chen Yu said with annoyance, \u201cMy grandpa isn\u2019t very reliable, I often can\u2019t get in touch with him.\u201dIn fact, if the bronze sword hadn\u2019t pierced the defense of the high-grade defense talisman in one stab and made her old man sense danger, she estimated the old man wouldn\u2019t have taken the initiative to call. Thinking about this, Chen Yu's heart ached,\u00a0one high-grade defense talisman worth more than a million yuan, ah, it\u2019s all gone with just a call\u2026Master Mao saw Chen Yu\u2019s face suddenly turn ugly and thought she was blaming herself, so he couldn\u2019t help but comfort her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can ask the next time you contact your grandfather.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201d Chen Yu nodded. She thought a bit and said, \u201cThe jade clasp on Third Brother\u2019s hand seems to be broken, Master Mao, can you fix it?\u201dWhen Master Mao heard what Chen Yu said, he immediately guessed the current seal in Lou Ming\u2019s body might not last long, so he asked, \u201cHow long can the seal last?\u201d\u201cThree days at most.\u201d Chen Yu explained, \u201cMy current cultivation base is still too weak, the seal won\u2019t last long.\u201d\u201cMoreover, in the research room just now, I absorbed a lot of evil energy, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t seal it again for a while.\u201d Chen Yu now had more evil energy than spiritual energy inside her body. She needed to slowly reduce the evil energy and take in more spiritual energy. Otherwise, not only couldn\u2019t she think about making another Spirit Inducing Seal, she wouldn\u2019t even be able to draw an ordinary charm.Seems like I can\u2019t go out and make money in this period of time, Chen Yu thought and became depressed again.Seeing Chen Yu\u2019s getting depressed again, Master Mao thought she was worried about the jade clasp not being repaired properly and letting the evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body break out again, so he comforted her again, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I have a spare for this jade clasp.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good then.\u201d Chen Yu said assuredly.\u201cLittle friend Chen, isn\u2019t your physique affected by the evil spirit? How can it be?\u201d Master Mao asked.\u201cIt seems like it's inherent, I have been like this since I was a child and my grandpa also said I have a special physique.\u201d Chen Yu answered.\u201cSpecial physique?\u201d Master Mao pondered for a moment, what kind of special physique is it to be able to absorb so much evil spirit and remain unharmed?Ding-a-ling\u2026Chen Yu embarrassedly glanced at Master Mao and took out her phone, walking to the side to pick up the call.\u201cShishi, will you be eating dinner at home tonight?\u201d Mother Chen asked.Chen Yu rubbed her hair that looked like it had been gnawed on by a dog and said with a guilty conscience, \u201cI asked my classmate to go with me to get my hair cut, I\u2019ll come home later tonight.\u201d She must get her hair done before going back, else she wouldn\u2019t know how to explain it.Seeing her daughter finally had some sense of beauty to actually take the initiative to get her hair styled, Mother Chen hung up with satisfaction without urging Chen Yu to come home earlier.Chen Yu breathed a sigh of relief, said goodbye to everyone and snuck out to find a hair salon.About two hours after Chen Yu left, the unconscious Lou Ming finally woke up. He saw Master Mao sitting at the side so he propped his body to get up.\u201cMaster Mao?\u201d Lou Ming felt that his mental state was pretty good.\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Master Mao asked.\u201cVery good. Master Mao, were you the one who helped me?\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s memory was a bit hazy. The most profound thing in his memory was the moment he touched the bronze sword and the evil spirit inside his body suddenly broke out uncontrollably.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Master Mao smiled and shook his head.Lou Ming was stunned as Chen Yu\u2019s figure flashed across his chaotic brain. Back then he seemed to have seen a little girl,\u00a0could it be\u2026 she was there too?\u201cIt was little friend Chen who saved you.\u201d Master Mao said, \u201cThis time\u2019s sudden riot could be resolved without any danger due to little friend Chen.\u201d\u201cChen Yu? As expected, she was there.\u201d Lou Ming was in a bit of a daze.\u201cBy the way, Lou Ming, why did the evil spirit in your body suddenly break out like this?\u201d Master Mao waited until now to understand this matter.\u201cI\u2019m also not very clear what happened.\u201d Lou Ming tried to remember through the hazy mist in his head, \u201cI was checking the bronze sword and the strange thing was when I touched the bronze sword, it suddenly shrank down.\u201d\u201cShrank?\u201d the expression on Master Mao\u2019s face became frigid.\u201cAlso, I thought the sword was very familiar so I held it to measure it, then\u2026 the evil spirit in my body suddenly went out of control.\u201d Lou Ming recalled carefully, \u201cI don\u2019t quite remember what happened after that.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s the case.\u201d Master Mao nodded thoughtfully, \u201cThen you should have a good rest, I\u2019ll investigate this bronze sword.\u201d\u201cMaster Mao, I think this sword has some kind of relationship with me.\u201d Lou Ming said all of a sudden.\u201cI\u2019ll investigate this matter, give me a call if you remember anything.\u201d Master Mao said, \u201cAlthough this time\u2019s riot was only threatening and not dangerous, your body still received an impact so you have to rest properly.\u201dMaster Mao left the courtyard after leaving this instruction.Lou Ming sat on the bed, raised his hand and blankly looked at the new jade clasp.He Qi stood at the side with an anxious heart:\u00a0Third Young Master said he didn\u2019t remember what happened after his evil spirit rioted, then he doesn\u2019t remember he was assaulted by Miss Chen Yu? Could it even be considered an assault?\u201cHe Qi, where did Chen Yu go?\u201d Lou Ming suddenly raised his head and asked.\u201cHuh?\u201d He Qi was startled, \u201cMiss Chen Yu\u2026 she went back home.\u201d\u201cWent back home, ah.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201d He Qi nodded resolutely; his movements were somewhat exaggerated.\u201cWhy are you so surprised when Chen Yu is mentioned?\u201d Lou Ming found it odd and asked.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0Should I talk or not?Author\u2019s NOTE:He Qi: This is a really difficult choice.TL NOTE:Hope we can meet again soon, my lovelies! ^ w ^Thank you for ChaiNotTea for good and fast PR! xoxo <3PR: ChaiNotTeaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s really unique.\u201d The hairdresser stood behind Chen Yu with a pair of scissors and couldn\u2019t help teasing at Chen Yu.\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t deliberately cut it like this, I wasn\u2019t careful and\u2026 cut off some hair, that\u2019s why it\u2019s like this.\u201d Chen Yu didn\u2019t dare say it was cut off by a bronze sword, it would scare people more than saying she cut her hair this way.\u201cNo wonder ah!\u201d The originally teasing hairdresser saw Chen Yu actually explain it so seriously, and felt that it\u2019s better not to say anymore. He looked at her hair up and down for a moment and said, \u201cHow do you want me to style it?\u201d\u201cJust cut it in whatever style would be good for me.\u201d Chen Yu has never worried about hairstyle.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to do any styling?\u201d The hairdresser seriously suggested, \u201cIf I casually cut your hair short with your small face and smooth hair, you\u2019d look like a little boy, ah.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Chen Yu shook her head decisively;\u00a0don\u2019t think you can swindle my money.\u201cOur store recently opened so we offer a 30% discount, oh.\u201d The hairdresser continued to tempt her, \u201cAfter the discount, the price would be about the same as a regular haircut.\u201d\u201cAbout the same?\u201d Chen Yu said in surprise, \u201cA haircut is that expensive?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m the boss, ah.\u201d The hairdresser pointed to the price list next to the mirror, cutting hair with the boss cost 388 yuan.After reading the price list, Chen Yu asked, \u201cCan I have an ordinary hairstylist?\u201dWhen the boss heard that Chen Yu wanted to change to a different hairstylist, he happily answered, \u201cNo way, the store just opened so I haven\u2019t had time to recruit people yet.\u201dIsn\u2019t this cheating people?\u00a0Chen Yu nodded with a heartbroken expression, \u201cThen you can cut my hair.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of style do you want?\u201d The salon owner asked.\u201cYou can figure it out.\u201d Anyway, it should be better than the mess she had right now.\u201cThen leave it to me, classmate.\u201d The boss smiled, raised his hand and clicked his scissors to cut the remaining half of Chen Yu\u2019s long hair.Before this, Chen Yu had never thought it would take so long just to cut a headful of hair. She sat in the store for three hours, when she woke up, she felt so hungry like her chest was about to stick to her back before her hair was barely done.After the haircut was done, Chen Yu looked in the mirror and awkwardly stretched out her slightly curling hair. Her fingers hooked the small curl until it straightened up before she let it go and the hair bounced back like a spring. Chen Yu blinked and felt that she hadn\u2019t adapted to her new look.\u201cHow is it? Isn\u2019t the little curly hair cute enough?\u201d The salon owner took out a tablet out of nowhere, found a beautiful anime girl picture and gave it to Chen Yu, \u201cIsn\u2019t it now 100% restored?\u201dChen Yu looked at herself in the mirror and saw a different person, she suddenly remembered what Han You often said in the dormitory, \u201cA hairstyle is a woman\u2019s second face.\u201dDid I just do plastic surgery?Although Chen Yu felt a little awkward, when she went home with her newly remodeled face, she made mother Chen so very happy. She was pleased with her daughter and thought in her heart:\u00a0Everyone says university is like a plastic surgery hospital, it\u2019s not even one semester and my daughter has already changed. So beautiful like this, ah!\u201cShishi, ah, this hairstyle is so beautiful, it makes you look cute and playful. It just so happens Mom bought you a few new skirts, so you can try them all.\u201d After saying this, Mother Chen immediately denied her own words, \u201cNo, the style of those skirts doesn\u2019t match your current hairstyle, I\u2019ll buy some other ones.\u201d\u201cMom, no need. I already have so many clothes that I haven\u2019t worn all of them yet.\u201d Every time Chen Yu came back, Mother Chen always bought new clothes for her. She now had a bunch of new clothes in her cabinet that she hasn\u2019t worn yet.\u201cNo way, if a girl changes hairstyle then she should change her bag, shoes, and clothes.\u201d Mother Chen ignored her daughter after she said that and drowned herself in excitement of online shopping.Mayor Chen only watched cheerfully at the side and thought,\u00a0well, as long as my wife is happy.However, Chen Yang actually frowned and asked, \u201cShishi, are you in love?\u201dClang!\u00a0The teacup in Mayor Chen\u2019s hand was slapped down on the coffee table, Mother Chen also stopped buying clothes, and the three family members all looked at Chen Yu in a daze.This girl changed so much suddenly, ah, could she be secretly dating someone?Chen Yu was taken aback for a moment before shaking her head frantically, \u201cNo, no way! I just went to a salon with my classmates, and the hairstylist suggested this style, so I just did it, ah.\u201d\u201cOh, so that\u2019s it.\u201d Mayor Chen picked up the cup again after calming himself down, \u201cShishi is already in college so it\u2019s okay to fall in love.\u201d\u201cIf you found a boyfriend, remember to bring him to us.\u201d Chen Yang wondered if he should ask Shao Hui and them to watch her for a while, so no one could abduct his sister.\u201cHolding hands and kissing is okay, but other\u2026\u201d \u00a0Mother Chen started to say.\u201cNo kissing!\u201d Mayor Chen looked at his wife with a dissatisfied look, \u201cHow are you teaching your children? How can you let them kiss, ah?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with kissing? Kissing won\u2019t get her pregnant, are you an old antique?\u201d Mother Chen said angrily.\u201cShishi is a girl, she\u2019s the one who will suffer.\u201d Mayor Chen said angrily too, \u201cI don\u2019t understand how they make TV dramas nowadays, those men like to forcefully kiss the girls, it\u2019s like they can make the other suddenly like them with just a kiss, isn\u2019t this misleading teenager? Shishi, you absolutely must not let others take advantage of you, do you understand?\u201d\u201cForced kiss? Then\u2026 that\u2026 what about women who kiss men forcibly? Does it also count as taking advantage of others?\u201d Chen Yu asked with some guilty conscience.Chen Yang raised his eyebrows, he looked at his sister\u2019s guilty expression and secretly decided to go find Shao Hui to find out more.Cough\u2026 Mayor Chen choked in a moment\u2019s carelessness.Mother Chen asked in surprise, \u201cShishi, did you forcibly kiss someone?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Chen Yu said full of guilt, \u201cI\u2019m just asking.\u201d\u201cSo, it\u2019s like that, ah.\u201d Mother Chen said with a sigh of relief, \u201cAlthough the one who suffers the most in this matter is the girl, it\u2019s always uncomfortable to be forcefully kissed by someone, you\u2019d better\u2026 don\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cUm!\u201d Chen Yu nodded, seemingly lost in thought. She couldn\u2019t help but think whether her action made Lou Ming uncomfortable.Today\u2019s matter was forced by circumstances, Third Brother won\u2019t mind much, ah.Chen Yu thought about it over and over and felt that she should still apologize, she heard the people in the city cared a lot about kissing.Thus, while the Chen family slept at night, Chen Yu skillfully jumped out the window and ran all the way to the Lou family\u2019s small courtyard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since Chen Yu rescued Lou Ming, the group of assistants became even more respectful towards her.\u201cDid Miss Chen Yu come to see Third Young Master?\u201d Tian Fei asked politely.\u201cEn, is Third Brother asleep?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cNot yet, Third Young Master is reading in the study right now.\u201d Tian Fei replied.\u201cReading a book as soon as he wakes up, are books that good?\u201d Chen Yu ran upstairs with thumping sounds.Before Chen Yu reached the study room\u2019s entrance, Lou Ming had already put down the book he was reading halfway. Even if he couldn\u2019t see her, he could guess Chen Yu was here by listening to the footsteps going upstairs.\u201cThird Brother.\u201d The study door wasn\u2019t closed, so Chen Yu quietly poked her head in.\u201cDid you change your hair?\u201d Lou Ming noticed Chen Yu\u2019s change in appearance at one glance.Chen Yu walked in with a sheepish smile, her fingers still pulling her hair uncomfortably.Tian Fei came in with refreshments. He heard Lou Ming talking about Chen Yu\u2019s hair and boasted, \u201cMs. Chen Yu changed her hairstyle and looks even more beautiful. I almost didn\u2019t recognize her.\u201d\u201cDo\u2026 do I?\u201d Sure enough, girls still like to be beautiful, although Chen Yu tried to pretend she didn\u2019t care, but after changing her hairstyle, apart from feeling a little uncomfortable, she was actually secretly very happy.\u201cYou\u2019re even more beautiful than before.\u201d Lou Ming nodded with a smile.Tian Fei put down the tea and walked out quietly with his imagination going wild. He didn\u2019t know if it was a psychological effect, but after seeing the scene where Miss Chen Yu forcibly kissed Third Young Master this afternoon, his brain became hard to control.\u201cWhy are you here so late?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cI had something to do in the afternoon so I left before Third Brother woke up, I was a little worried.\u201d Chen Yu explained.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Lou Ming thanked her with a warm smile, \u201cI heard it was you who saved me this time, thank you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what should be done, ah, I promised I\u2019ll help you to keep the evil spirit under control.\u201d Chen Yu said with a have-you-forgotten look, \u201cSo, you don\u2019t have to thank me, furthermore, our relationship is good, if you say thank you then it\u2019d make us look like strangers.\u201d\u201cI still have to say what should be said.\u201d Lou Ming insisted.\u201cThen, then I also want to apologize to you.\u201d Chen Yu said with a guilty conscience.\u00a0Still have to say what should be said, indeed, I still have to apologize, ah.\u201cApologize?\u201d Lou Ming looked at Chen Yu in confusion.\u201cEn.\u201d Guilt was written all over Chen Yu\u2019s face, \u201cI\u2026 I did a bad thing today. Of course, I was forced to do it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Lou Ming asked curiously.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Chen Yu gritted her teeth and said, \u201cI took advantage of Third Brother, although I didn\u2019t mean to, I still have to apologize when I should apologize.\u201dTook advantage??? Lou Ming\u2019s smart brain was stunned, he couldn\u2019t understand what Chen Yu said at all.\u201cI\u2026 I forcefully kissed Third Brother.\u201d Chen Yu blushed like a boiled prawn, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but I really didn\u2019t mean it!\u201dI forcefully kissed Third Brother!I forcefully kissed Third Brother!!I forcefully kissed Third Brother!!!The superior IQ brain that was inside Lou Ming\u2019s head stopped working for the first time.\u201cThe evil spirit in Third Brother\u2019s body was too scary, and the jade clasp was broken while the bronze sword kept on attacking me. I didn\u2019t know what to do, but if the evil spirit isn\u2019t sealed back in time, I\u2019m afraid that you would be completely controlled by it, so I called my Grandpa.\u201d\u201cMy Grandpa said as long as I pressed my lips to yours\u2026\u201dPressing lips???\u00a0Lou Ming sat still as if he was struck by lightning when he heard these words, it was even more graphic than just \u2018kiss\u2019.\u201c\u2026and pull your energy through, then I can help you recover and seal the out of control evil spirit. That\u2019s why, ah, I really didn\u2019t mean to force a kiss on you, I was compelled to do that. But my Mom said no matter what, the person being forcefully kissed wouldn\u2019t be happy with it, so, Third Brother, could you not be angry with me because I have apologized?\u201d Chen Yu asked pitifully.With his heart holding back rivers and overturning seas, Lou Ming\u2019s expression alternated a few times, and as he faced a certain person\u2019s imploring gaze, he couldn\u2019t even say a word out of embarrassment.\u201cBrother, are you really angry?\u201d Chen Yu asked cautiously.\u201cWhat would you do if I really was angry?\u201d Lou Ming finally composed himself and asked awkwardly.\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you say, as long as Third Brother isn\u2019t angry, I will take responsibility.\u201d Chen Yu was always a good, responsible child.Take responsibility? Lou Ming looked strangely at Chen Yu, \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re talking about?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026 take responsibility, ah.\u201d Chen Yu blinked in a daze;\u00a0didn\u2019t I clearly say it?Sure enough, she doesn\u2019t know what she said, Lou Ming closed his eyes in helplessness and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t take advantage of me, you don\u2019t need to take responsibility.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 my Mom said forcefully kissing\u2026\u201d\u201cYou did it to save me, it\u2019s not\u2026 taking advantage.\u201d Lou Ming interrupted Chen Yu\u2019s words, he really didn\u2019t want to hear the two words \u2018forcefully kiss\u2019 anymore, \u201cAnd the girl is the one who suffers with this kind of thing.\u201d\u201cOh, so it\u2019s saving you, then I can be relieved.\u201d Chen Yu exhaled and said happily, \u201cThen I won\u2019t disturb Third Brother any longer, I\u2019m going so Third Brother should also get some rest.\u201dAfter Chen Yu left, Lou Ming sat in the study alone, without any thoughts of reading, his mind was fully occupied with the awkward conversation he had just had. Embarrassed, ah, he was so embarrassed he suddenly laughed out loud.\u201cWhat a silly girl, everyone already said it\u2019s the girl who suffers.\u201dTL NOTE:Me and Chai have agreed that we all should not kiss someone by force (as in sexual harassment), although this is a special case, it\u2019s more like resuscitation.PR: ChaiNotTeaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked at the new jade clasp, thought for a while and said, \u201cMaster Mao, do you have any thoughts about the bronze sword?\u201d\u201cThat bronze sword does have a problem.\u201d Said Master Mao, \u201cThere\u2019s a totem on the hilt which contains a very strange energy.\u201d\u201cStrange energy?\u201d Lou Ming thought of the information faxed to him by the National Academy of Sciences, which also stated that a strange energy was detected.\u201cIt\u2019s not a spiritual power, but it\u2019s also not an evil spirit.\u201d Master Mao said, \u201cI can\u2019t be sure for now, but what I\u2019m certain is that this sword shouldn\u2019t be a general\u2019s sword.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d Lou Ming was a little surprised.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s still uncertain, but it must be related to Xuan Men*.\u201d Master Mao said, \u201cI mentioned it before, many sects have lost their inheritance, it\u2019s very possible this sword is one of them.\u201d [T/N: it can be translated as Dark / Mysterious Gate]\u201cYou mean\u2026 this is the sword of a Celestial Master?\u201d Lou Ming understood what Master Mao meant, he asked in astonishment, \u201cBut, why is a Celestial Master\u2019s sword inside a general\u2019s coffin?\u201d\u201cThis has to wait until the Nanling Archaeological Team\u2019s research reaches a conclusion. After we have a certain understanding of the tomb owner, then it would be more accurate to extrapolate.\u201d Master Mao said, \u201cHowever\u2026 there are two possibilities.\u201d\u201cFirst, this general was also a Celestial Master. There\u2019s a secret technique in ancient books: through a certain medium, Celestial Masters can call forth Yin troops from the Underworld to fight. This bronze sword is likely to be the medium for calling the Yin soldiers.\u201d Master Mao speculated. [T/N: Yin as in yin and yang, Yin represents death]\u201cCalling soldiers from the Underworld? Is it really possible?\u201d Lou Ming was obviously shocked by this hypothesis.\u201cIt is indeed possible to use soldiers from the Underworld, as long as a Celestial Master has enough cultivation. When the Celestial Master come across an especially malevolent demon, they can use a *local city god\u2019s Yin troops for assistance. But each time they use this kind of technique, they can only call one or two soldiers at most, and it also consumes a lot of spiritual energy. The ancient books recorded this mystical technique of using millions of Yin troops have been lost, so it can only be regarded as a legend at this point.\u201d Master Mao explained, \u201cAs for whether it\u2019s really possible to use this technique or not in ancient times, we\u2019re unable to determine this.\u201d [T/N:\u00a0(from Wikipedia) is a tutelary deity or deities in Chinese folk religion who is believed to protect the people and the affairs of the particular village, town or city of great dimension, and the corresponding afterlife location.]\u201cThen, what about the other possibility?\u201d Lou Ming continued asking.\u201cThe other possibility is also very high, it\u2019s that the general was an altered corpse.\u201d Master Mao said.\u201cAltered corpse?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what we call zombies [T/N: jiang shi, Chinese zombies]. I saw the topographic map around the cemetery, it\u2019s a good place to raise corpses.\u201d Master Mao explained, \u201cThe owner of the tomb was a general in the Warring States Period, so he must have fought and murdered countless numbers of people during his lifetime. This kind of person with a heavy aura of death, if he was buried in a place with thick Yin energy, it would be easy to change him into a zombie. It\u2019s even easier with this kind of place that\u2019s good for raising corpses.\u201d\u201cBut there was only a pile of bones inside when the coffin was opened, ah.\u201d Lou Ming said, \u201cIf it was a zombie, then the cemetery wouldn\u2019t be dug out so smoothly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why this sword appeared there.\u201d Master Mao said.\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d Lou Ming reacted quickly, \u201cThis general was likely a zombie a long time ago, then a Celestial Master entered the cemetery and sealed the zombie with the bronze sword?\u201d\u201cThese are the two most probable outcomes.\u201d Master Mao said, \u201cThe excavation hasn\u2019t been completed yet, and the tomb owner\u2019s identity hasn\u2019t been verified. This situation has to wait for the information to be sent over, so I will go back to the Metaphysics HQ to find some old friends and study it together.\u201dLou Ming nodded, indicating he understood, however, when thinking about the feeling of familiarity he felt with the bronze sword, Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but ask again, \u201cMaster Mao, I felt a sense of familiarity when I got close to the sword, I can even feel the joy that passed through from the sword to me.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s really one of those two possibilities, do you think\u2026 this general was my past life?\u201d Lou Ming asked.Master Mao suddenly paused sipping his cup of tea, he looked at Lou Ming and said hesitatingly, \u201cNo one knows one\u2019s own past life, the so-called samsara is a new life, a rebirth, no matter if this general was your past life or not, there\u2019s no relationship with who you are now. You are two completely different people.\u201dLou Ming nodded thoughtfully and didn\u2019t pursue more questions. He knew what Master Mao was worried about, and he also knew why he said that.In fact, Master Mao\u2019s worries were completely unnecessary. When he was young, Lou Ming didn\u2019t understand why he was different from others, why he was born with this suffocating evil spirit and couldn\u2019t come into contact with others, and why he was imprisoned in this small courtyard, therefore, he became extremely obsessed with the source of his evil spirit. He always felt if everything in this world has a cause and effect, then if he got the effect, he must look for the cause.But the present Lou Ming wasn\u2019t so persistent anymore, no matter what kind of cause created the current result, even if his past life did something to deserve the wrath of Heaven and Earth. Since he did it himself, then he should be the one to bear the responsibility. He was purely curious and simply wanted to know the reason, he wouldn\u2019t dig into the problem to the extremes like before.TL NOTE:My translation isn\u2019t that good, so please just try to understand the basic story line with me ^^;Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Believe It Or Not, I Already Caught YouCH 37.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37 - 2: You Want to Protect Her\"By the way, the little Celestial Master named Chen Yu\u2026\u201d Master Mao suddenly asked, \u201cWhen did you meet her?\u201dSpeaking of Chen Yu, Lou Ming\u2019s mind returned to last night, picturing the little girl confessing about taking advantage of him with a guilty expression, he couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cShe\u2019s a freshman at Imperial University this year.\u201d\u201cImperial University, didn\u2019t she happen to be there when you absorb auspicious aura to block the evil spirit this year?\u201d Master Mao asked in surprise.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He thought back about the little girl\u2019s expression when she threatened him that day, Lou Ming\u2019s mouth turned upwards again.\u201cI remember, you asked me about a Suppressing Spirit Talisman that night.\u201d Master Mao recalled, \u201cDid she use a Suppressing Spirit Talisman on you?\u201dLou Ming was stunned for a moment, but he didn\u2019t hide it as he nodded his head and explained, \u201cThe talisman didn\u2019t cause any bad influence on me.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 her Suppressing Spirit Talisman can completely suppress your evil spirit?\u201d Seeing Lou Ming specially emphasize this point, Master Mao quickly reacted to what Lou Ming said. What\u2019s more, when he saw Chen Yu using her magic skill yesterday, Master Mao had already suspected that Chen Yu was a descendant of the Luoshan Sect.The Luoshan Sect\u2019s Suppressing Talisman [T/N: this word has two meanings, suppress and calm, so this talisman should be named Suppressing Talisman, but I chose Calming in the past chapters, it shall be named Suppressing Talisman from now on. The normal talisman can only suppress the spirit] was very good as it also calms the spirit at the same time. Lou Ming pointed out he felt no discomfort to protect Chen Yu, fearing Master Mao would do something to her. Lou Ming instructed his assistants to hide Chen Yu\u2019s existence and defended her in front of him (Mao).\u00a0It seems that Lou Ming really cares about this little girl, Master Mao thought to himself.\u201cDid you keep her Suppressing Spirit Talisman?\u201d Master Mao wanted to borrow and study it, everyone said the Luoshan Sect\u2019s talismans were unique and it was a rare opportunity to see them.\u201cNo.\u201d Lou Ming shook his head.\u201cYou lost it?\u201d Although the talisman will become a piece of waste paper after it was used, it was still a pity to lose such a profound talisman.\u201cNo, Chen Yu drew it directly on my hand, so\u2026 I don\u2019t have any used-up talisman paper here.\u201d Lou Ming explained.\u201cShe drew it directly on your hand with spiritual power?\u201d Master Mao remembered yesterday when Chen Yu used spiritual power to draw a symbol in the empty air before sealing it within Lou Ming\u2019s body.Although drawing an incantation using spiritual power directly is more effective, it would consume a huge amount of spiritual power. Nowadays, as spiritual power was getting weaker and thinner, it was rare for one to use it so extravagantly.\u201cMaster Mao? Chen Yu didn\u2019t seem to know the Suppressing Talisman will have an effect on my body and she didn\u2019t use the charm on me after the one time, so I have to trouble you to keep it from my father.\u201d Lou Ming requested.The assistant group has to protect his personal safety and prevent threats from ordinary humans and Master Mao has to protect him from all other threats. Since he first designed a weapon for the Ministry of National Defense, wherever he went, not only the flow of people needed to be controlled, but even ghosts and spirits needed to be eliminated in advance. Everything that could disturb him simply can\u2019t exist.If it wasn\u2019t for the aura inside the small yard needed vitality stimulation, this compound would probably be thoroughly destroyed because of him. Other people wouldn\u2019t know the armed forces placed in this small courtyard were actually guarding a ticking time bomb that could explode at any time.Therefore, that day when Lou Ming was so protective of a trespassing Chen Yu, he felt he was preserving not only their childhood relationship, but also because of the small courtyard residence\u2019s guilty conscience. [T/N: he was protective because of their childhood relationship and his guilty conscience of living in this place that could bring harm to her and her family]They unconsciously braved their life for him to maintain this supernatural operation.\u201cHe Qi also mentioned it to me yesterday, he said you don\u2019t want others to know about the girl\u2019s existence.\u201d Master Mao said, \u201cBut after so many years, she\u2019s the only one who\u2019s not afraid of your evil spirit, besides, she\u2019s also a Celestial Master who can seal your evil spirit without the least bit of harm.\u201dThe light in Lou Ming\u2019s eyes flashed as he frowned at Master Mao.\u201cShe also has a grandfather who taught her, if she\u2019s already this good, then her Grandpa must be even better. We\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster Mao, I know what you want to say.\u201d Lou Ming interrupted Master Mao. \u201cI sent someone to find Chen Yu\u2019s grandfather without any results. Although I told He Qi and the rest of the guards to stop searching, I know they definitely won\u2019t give up, they will secretly continue searching without telling me, but they still haven\u2019t found Chen Yu\u2019s grandpa\u2019s whereabouts until now.\u201d\u201cI know if we use Chen Yu, we will be able to find her grandfather more quickly. There are many ways to get her to help. Chen Yu\u2019s father is the Imperial City\u2019s mayor, I don\u2019t need to do anything since my father can do everything with just a phone call, but I don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d Lou Ming explained, \u201cShe\u2019s the only person who can make me feel at ease, I don\u2019t have to worry about walking close to her, staying with her for a long time, or accidentally leaking evil spirits that can hurt her.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to put pressure on her or force her to do anything.\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cIt\u2019s just asking her to help find her grandfather, how can it be counted as forcing?\u201d Master Mao asked defensively.\u201cIf we find him and Chen Yu\u2019s grandfather still can\u2019t solve the evil spirit problem, what then?\u201d Lou Ming asked, \u201cIf my father forces them to stay in Imperial Capital and stay with me because of their abiliity, what then?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d Lou Ming continued, \u201cChen Yu already took the initiative to mention contacting her grandfather even when I didn\u2019t ask her to. She wanted to call her grandfather to ask about my situation and whether there\u2019s any solution. So, you see, we don\u2019t need to do anything more, things are already developing in the best direction.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying all this just trying to protect that little girl.\u201d Master Mao couldn\u2019t help sighing.Lou Ming knew Master Mao finally agreed with him so he couldn\u2019t help but reveal a smile and offered Master Mao a cup of tea.Master Mao glared at Lou Ming and said, \u201cI asked that girl, it seems her charm that\u2019s sealing your evil spirit will last for two to three days, do you want to go for a walk with these few days?\u201d\u201cI have always wanted to climb the Great Wall.\u201d Lou Min said expectantly.==In the small Chen house, Chen Yu, who rarely went out during weekends, was sitting in her room, impatiently writing messages to the old man.I Want to Fix Road: Why won\u2019t you answer my call? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s out of battery, I won\u2019t believe it.When Chen Yu called just now, it kept showing that the other party\u2019s phone was off.I Want to Fix Road: There\u2019s only one advanced defensive talisman left, what if I run into a dangerous situation again? How can I find you, aaah!!I Want to Fix Road: Am I not someone who you personally brought up? If I\u2019m in danger, then you wouldn\u2019t know if I\u2019m really alright or not.I Want to Fix Road: I still have one important thing to ask you, I can\u2019t explain it online, call me back, you hear me?I Want to Fix Road: Remember to call back, or I will cut your beard clean the next time I see you.Ding dong!Chen Yu was still sending messages angrily when her Wechat suddenly received a message.Third Brother: Want to climb the Great Wall together?Author\u2019s NOTE:Old Wu: Letting you find me after you kissed a zombie, isn\u2019t this asking myself to be scolded?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Weather here wasn\u2019t like the south as it won\u2019t be warm even when the sun was out.Chen Yu ran back upstairs again and put on a loose baseball uniform before leaving the house.Chen Yu trotted all the way to the gate and turned to the right to see two black cars parked on the side of the road, a smiling Tian Fei was standing beside the car.\u201cAssistant Tian.\u201d Chen Yu greeted happily.Tian Fei waited until Chen Yu got closer to the car before he opened the door to the back seat with a face full of smiles. Chen Yu looked in and saw Lou Ming sitting inside, smiling softly towards her.\u201cThird Brother.\u201d Chen Yu waved her hand joyfully.\u201cCome on in.\u201d Lou Ming said.Chen Yu got in obediently, because she ran all the way, Chen Yu\u2019s breathing was a little ragged. When Lou Ming heard this, he frowned, got a bottle of water, unscrewed the lid, and handed it to Chen Yu. He reproachfully asked, \u201cWhy run in such a hurry?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that you\u2019d wait too long, ah.\u201d Chen Yu raised her head and took a sip of water.\u201cWe\u2019re not in a hurry, it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re a little late.\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cBut I want to go early, ah.\u201d Chen Yu said excitedly, \u201cI saw the Great Wall in a book when I was in elementary school. The teacher said that it was one of the eight wonders of the world. The world is so big, but there are only eight wonders and I\u2019m going to see one of them soon, I\u2019m so excited!\u201d\u201cThe eight wonders of the world don\u2019t mean there are only eight wonders in the world.\u201d Lou Ming corrected with a smile.\u201cHow many wonders are there?\u201d Chen Yu asked with gleaming eyes.\u201c\u2026\u201d When Chen Yu asked him so suddenly, Lou Ming didn\u2019t know how to answer. Actually, thinking about it carefully, there were many wonders in the world, of course it\u2019s impossible to have only eight, but the most widely known and recognized by the world seemed to be only these eight. From a certain perspective, what Chen Yu said was quite right too.\u201cThe most famous are these eight.\u201d Lou Ming had no other choice but to say so.Fortunately, Chen Yu wasn\u2019t a serious person so she didn\u2019t dive further in this topic, her eyes were full of joy as she was about to see the Great Wall.\u201cHave you never been to the Great Wall with your classmates?\u201d Chen Yu had been in the Imperial Capital for more than three months. College students are the ones who have the most spare time, so Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help asking when he looked at Chen Yu\u2019s appearance as if she was going there for the first time.\u201cNo.\u201d Chen Yu shook her head, \u201cMost of my old classmates have never left Qingmu Province while my university classmates are completely the opposite. They seemed to have been everywhere and people who have never been to the Great Wall are so rare, moreover, it\u2019s still inside the Imperial Capital.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t been there yet.\u201d Lou Ming had lived in the Imperial Capital for almost thirty years of his life and had never been to the Great Wall even once. He felt a little dazed when he thought he was going today.\u201cMe too.\u201d Chen Yu blinked wittily, \u201cSuch a coincidence, oh.\u201d\u201cHeh\u2026\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but stretched out his hand and rubbed Chen Yu\u2019s head. The little girl\u2019s hair was cut short and she didn\u2019t tie it anymore, it felt softer now.Seeing Lou Ming\u2019s mood improve, Chen Yu happily took a chips pack that was set aside for her and ate it while chuckling.Tian Fei drove quietly in the front seat, taking a glance in the rearview mirror from time to time, Lou Ming\u2019s emotional changes could be seen in full view. He affirmed for the ten thousandth time as long as Miss Chen Yu was here, Third Young Master\u2019s mood would easily improve.Badaling [a section of the Great Wall that\u2019s popular with tourists] was still some distance away from the city, it took two hours to drive to the Great Wall\u2019s foot compound. Iit was already noon when they arrived, after looking at the majestic structure, Lou Ming and Chen Yu decided to first eat something, after all, you wouldn\u2019t have the strength to climb without eating, ah.However, they couldn\u2019t find a single restaurant inside the huge Badaling area, it was filled with rows and rows of souvenir shops. The two of them were too lazy to drive again just to find something to eat, so they found a small shop and bought two bowls of instant noodles, eating them while squatting at the foot of the Great Wall.After filling their stomachs with instant noodles, the two started the difficult walk climbing the crowded Great Wall under the protection of the four assistants.\u201cSo many people, ah!\u201d Chen Yu sighed.\u201cYeah.\u201d Pushed by so many people, Lou Ming felt for the first time it wasn\u2019t always happy to be in contact with people.\u201cYou see, there are a lot of worn steps. Did they get weathered over time or were they trampled on by so many people?\u201d Chen Yu asked, pointing to the bumpy steps under her feet.\u201cMost of the steps we\u2019re stepping on have already been repaired, the remaining original steps can only be found inside inaccessible mountains, but they should be worn too.\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cLet\u2019s just say, a house needs to be renovated after several decades, while this Great Wall is already thousands of years old.\u201d Chen Yu said, climbing up again, looking at the endless ups and downs of the Great Wall, unable to see the end. She sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s really long, ah, I don\u2019t even know how long it is.\u201d\u201cAccording to the Historical Relic and Survey Map Department of the national Great Wall resources, the total length of the Great Wall in the Ming Dynasty is 8,851.8 kilometers, while the early stages of Great Wall in Qin and Han Dynasty are more than 10,000 kilometers, totaling more than 21,000 kilometers in length.\u201d Lou Ming said along the way. [around 13,049 miles]\u201cThird Brother, how come you know everything, ah?\u201d Chen Yu looked at Lou Ming with an admiring expression.\u201cI read a lot of books.\u201d Lou Ming said in a bad mood.Feeling Third Brother\u2019s dislike, Chen Yu stuck out her tongue and continued to climb up. The more she climbed up, the less people there were, when she reached the top of the mountain, there were only a few tourists left. Looking at the majestic and winding Great Wall on the lofty mountains, Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but take out her phone to snap some photos.Lou Ming had just arrived and leaned his back leaning against the wall. His slightly long hair was messed up by the mountain wind while his gaze wandered to the far horizon with a calm and gentle expression.Snap!Lou Ming turned around abruptly and faced the phone Chen Yu had put down, he couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cNext time you try to sneak a shot, remember to turn the sound off.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s taking a sneak shot?\u201d Chen Yu denied, \u201cI\u2019m obviously taking pictures in broad daylight.\u201dLou Ming shook his head helplessly.\u201cThird Brother, the shot just now was from the side, let\u2019s take it from the front this time.\u201d Chen Yu was reaching for a yard after getting an inch.She really did it in broad daylight.

Turning around, she saw Tian Fei and the other bodyguards standing not too far away. She suddenly shouted, \u201cAssistant Tian, please take a photo of me with Third Brother.\u201dAssistant Tian came over, but instead of picking up Chen Yu\u2019s phone, he took out a selfie stick from his pocket and handed it to Chen Yu and said, \u201cMiss Chen Yu, my photography skills aren\u2019t particularly good, please take this selfie stick and take a photo yourself.\u201dJoking, ah, looking for someone to take your picture, how can it compare with taking it yourself.Sure enough, Tian Fei watched Chen Yu and Lou Ming pose non-stop with their heads close together for a good-looking group photo. He once again commended himself for his quick-wittedness.While Tian Fei was praising his own wit, a tall soldier on the side couldn\u2019t help but remind him, \u201cBrother Tian, photos of Third Young Master can\u2019t be circulated outside, ah.\u201d\u201cCirculated outside? Is Miss Chen Yu an outsider?\u201d Tian Fei asked in retort.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t count as one?\u201d the tall soldier asked in doubt.\u201cLook at the way Third Young Master is laughing; how can you treat Miss Chen Yu as an outsider? Stupid!\u201d Tian Fei rolled his eyes in disgust.The tall soldier touched his head in confusion, he definitely should listen to Tian Fei, ah.Nighttime fell early in this season and soon the sun went down. Chen Yu accompanied Lou Ming watching the sunset silently, waiting for the starry sky to appear.The two sat on the steps, quietly looking at the starry sky. The Great Wall would be lit up at night, making it look like a fire dragon, showing the majesty that would be missing during the day. Fondly looking at the starry night from the Great Wall\u2019s, Lou Ming quietly looked up at the glistening sky for an hour, Chen Yu wondered whether he was counting the stars.\u201cAh\u2026choo!\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help sneezing when a cold wind flew by.Lou Ming suddenly returned to his senses, realizing he had been sitting quietly on the Great Wall at night for too long, forgetting that Chen Yu was beside him. He took off his coat and put it on Chen Yu as he apologized, \u201cSorry, I\u2019ve been watching the stars for too long, let\u2019s go back.\u201dChen Yu stood up wearing his coat, walked down the stairs with Lou Ming as she asked, \u201cThird Brother, were you counting the stars or thinking about other things?\u201d\u201cI was in a daze.\u201d Lou Ming replied with a shy smile.\u201cIn a daze?\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.\u201cI haven\u2019t been to many places, but I have read a lot of books.\u201d Lou Ming explained, \u201cThere are many places I yearn to see in books. I read travel notes written by others along with photos of those places. There are photos at dawn, sunset, evening, and even with star-studded night skies. Back then, I always thought how good it would be if one day I could experience it even once. Now, I found out the night sky I could see with my own eyes is truly much more beautiful than the photos. I couldn\u2019t help but be immersed in it and stared in a daze.\u201d\u201cThen, isn\u2019t it still lacking a \u2018dawn\u2019?\u201d Chen Yu stopped walking down.\u201cHuh?\u201d Lou Ming looked at Chen Yu in surprise.\u201cDawn, sunset, starry sky, there\u2019s still dawn ah.\u201d Chen Yu counted with her fingers.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, we don\u2019t need to watch it.\u201d Lou Ming felt the sudden drop in temperature at the top of the mountain. Although this opportunity was rare, he couldn\u2019t let the little girl catch a cold with him, ah.\u201cLet\u2019s watch, let\u2019s watch, I haven\u2019t seen sunrise on the Great Wall either.\u201d Chen Yu said excitedly, \u201cSo many classmates in my school have been to the Great Wall already, but I\u2019m sure not many people have seen dawn, sunset and starry sky all at the same trip like this.\u201d\u201cForget it, the weather is too cold, you\u2019ll catch a cold at this rate.\u201d Lou Ming found Chen Yu was really easy to persuade, with only a brief mention, she became even more excited than himself.\u201cThird Young Master, there are spare blankets in the car.\u201d Tian Fei who had been silent all this time, suddenly said this.When Chen Yu heard him, she became even more excited, \u201cThird Brother, let\u2019s watch the sunrise. It\u2019s decided, I\u2019ll call my Mom.\u201dLou Ming watched as she ran to the side and called her mother. He suddenly turned his head and looked at Tian Fei.Tian Fei quietly swallowed a mouthful of spit and said, \u201cThird Young Master, I\u2019ll go get the blankets.\u201d Saying this, Tian Fei used his excellent special forces\u2019 running speed to quickly move, after a few seconds, his figure was already nowhere to be seen.When Tian Fei came back, he not only brought a blanket, but also some food. Chen Yu clearly said that she would accompany Lou Ming to wait for sunrise, but before nine o\u2019clock, she already leaned on Lou Ming\u2019s shoulder, sleeping while wrapped in a warm blanket.When the pale eastern horizon was vaguely bathed in a red color and the rosy clouds of dawn filled the entire sky, Lou Ming gently awakened Chen Yu who was sleeping on his shoulder.Chen Yu rubbed her eyes and watched the sunrise sleepily. When she was fully awake, the sunrise was already no more. She obviously didn\u2019t care much about that because she was still very excited, \u201cThe sunrise from Great Wall is indeed different from other places.\u201d\u201cWhere is it different?\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cThis is the sunrise that appears above one of the eight wonders, ah.\u201d Chen Yu said seriously.The golden sunlight shone on Lou Ming\u2019s face, making his already fair complexion look even more transparent while his dark pupils turned into a faint gold, but the smile on his face was brighter than the sun.\u201cThird Brother, I\u2019ll come with you again next time.\u201d Chen Yu said all of a sudden.So, you indeed stayed here specially for me last night?\u00a0Lou Ming was moved; his palm couldn\u2019t help messing up Chen Yu\u2019s already messy short hair, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll just find you to get some Suppressing Talismans if I want to see it again.\u201d\u201cSuppressing Talisman can only be drawn by me on the spot, furthermore, it can only last for two hours, not enough time for you to go home.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the effect lacks a bit, you can just draw it directly on talisman papers, just draw it a bit more and it would be the same.\u201d Lou Ming said.Lou Ming had used Suppressing Talisman twice and there\u2019s nothing unusual on his body, so he really wanted to ask Chen Yu to draw some talismans for him, not necessarily to watch sunrise, but to use it when he needed it.\u201cNo.\u201d Chen Yu shook his head with a serious face, \u201cYou can\u2019t use a Suppressing Charm that\u2019s drawn on talisman paper.\u201dLou Ming looked at Chen Yu with surprise.\u201cA Suppressing Charm that\u2019s drawn on talisman paper has too much murderous aura, this charm can suppress the spirit at the same time so it\u2019s not suitable for Third Brother to use.\u201d Chen Yu explained, \u201cI meticulously weakened the murderous aura when drawing the charm directly using spiritual energy so it won\u2019t harm the human body.\u201dLou Ming was stunned for a moment before he said, \u201cSo it\u2019s like this.\u201d\u201cEn!\u201d Chen Yu nodded.Chen Yu was a head shorter than Lou Ming, as soon as Lou Ming lowered his head, he saw the girl\u2019s thick and long eyelashes and soft hair glowing golden under the bright sunshine. When her little face was raised slightly, he saw his reflection in her big inky black eyes.\u201cThird Brother, let\u2019s go back.\u201d Chen Yu said all of a sudden.Lou Ming returned to his senses. As he gazed at the girl\u2019s jumping back, he vaguely recalled a familiar scene in a memory that he didn\u2019t know.\u201cThird Brother, hurry up, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d Chen Yu had descended more than a dozen steps, and when she saw that Lou Ming was still in a daze, she couldn\u2019t help but urge him.\u201cAlright!\u201d Lou Ming laughed. As if wind was blowing on the soles of his feet, his steps became lighter and lighter.Author\u2019s NOTE:When Chen Yu sneezed, a soldier on the side saw Third Young Master take off his coat and put it on Chen Yu.

Her spiritual energy was depleted so she hadn\u2019t taken any new tasks for nearly half a month.Chen Yu was heartbroken, she couldn\u2019t help but complain to Lou Ming, \u201cThird Brother, I only took advantage of you for a bit and I haven\u2019t been able to pick up tasks for half a month. Kissing you is really expensive, ah.\u201dLou Ming listened to Chen Yu complain and looked at her with a complicated expression, he said helplessly under the little girl\u2019s aggrieved expression, \u201cThen\u2026 I don\u2019t want 30% profit from the Profound Strike Talisman.\u201dWhen Chen Yu heard this, she was so happy that she was almost unable to tell which way was north, \u201cYou don\u2019t want any?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want any.\u201d Lou Ming nodded.\u201cAissh, this isn\u2019t good, ah.\u201d polite words should still be said.\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d Lou Ming broke out into laughter.\u201cThird Brother, you\u2019re so good, ah, I\u2019ll help you again when your evil spirit breaks out.\u201d Chen Yu said without feeling pressured, anyway, she would still help him regardless of whether Lou Ming gave her 30% profit or not, but beautiful words, ah, they can always make people happy.And our dear young master Lou, he didn\u2019t feel happy, instead he trembled in shock and the teacup in his hand fell down and broke.Finally, on the seventeenth day after she took advantage of Lou Ming, the evil spirit in Chen Yu\u2019s body was completely gone and abundant spiritual power returned to her body again. In order to make up for the progress she had fallen behind on, Chen Yu took several tasks from the Spiritual Website. She must be promoted quickly in order to take on the higher-level, higher-paying tasks.Chen Yu ran out of school under the pretext of going home, it would take some time to solve the two tasks she had just accepted. As she walked towards the school, she pondered where to find a hotel to rest. As she was thinking about it, she exited out of an alley and saw a police car in front of her.Chen Yu didn\u2019t mind. Imperial City was so big and there were cases every day. It\u2019s not surprising to see police handling cases but when she saw a female ghost trying to climb a policeman, Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but gasp in admiration towards the ghost\u2019s courage.The righteousness of the police has an effect of driving away and repelling evil spirits, ghosts generally don\u2019t dare approach public officials such as police or soldiers. However, this evil female ghost still crawled on the policeman\u2019s body persistently, even though her body was obviously distorted and scalded by the policeman\u2019s righteous aura.Chen Yu could understand if this female ghost came for revenge, but she couldn\u2019t feel any resentment coming from the ghost, it was as if she was just torturing herself.Chen Yu was very curious, so she couldn\u2019t help but take a closer look. With one look, she recognized the female ghost who assaulted handsome guys.The female ghost also saw Chen Yu, but she didn\u2019t stop her actions. Since the first time Chen Yu warned her, she had run into Chen Yu several times. The ghost was surprised to discover this little Heavenly Master wouldn\u2019t really care about her as long as the ghost didn\u2019t do too much.As a result, the perverted ghost became even more unbridled in her way of molesting handsome guys that she wouldn't even leave a policeman alone, although it\u2019s true today\u2019s police brother is really handsome and stylish. Even if the pain of her soul being burned by his righteous energy was unbearable, the perverted ghost still firmly decided she must take advantage of the handsome brother, to kiss and hug him tight.Chen Yu saw the perverted ghost actually sacrifice herself this much, she wondered what the policeman looked like, so she took a few steps forward, raised her eyes and looked at the policeman\u2019s face. Chen Yu\u2019s expression suddenly changed as she watched the female ghost climb onto the policeman\u2019s neck, her mouth was pouting, ready to kiss him.Chen Yu used a hundred-meter sprint speed to run over, grab the perverted ghost by her neck, and throw her to the ground.\u201cAisshh, little Celestial Master, what are you doing? I was just gonna kiss him, ah.\u201d The lecher was shocked by the sudden pinch on her neck.\u201cDon\u2019t touch him!\u201d Chen Yu threatened.\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d Chen Yang felt someone running towards him and as soon as he turned around, he saw his sister\u2019s face, so he asked with a frown.\u201cHa, ha, ha\u2026 brother.\u201d Chen Yu shook her hand awkwardly.When the lecherous ghost heard Chen Yu calling out \u2018brother\u2019, she was immediately terrified. She didn\u2019t try to get up from the ground anymore, instead she crawled to the side alley, trying to leave the scene as soon as possible without attracting Chen Yu\u2019s attention.F*ck me, Imperial City is so big, how could she have met little Heavenly Master\u2019s brother, ah?Chen Yang looked at his little sister and his gaze stopped for a moment on the linen bag Chen Yu\u2019s shoulder. Chen Yang thought his little sister liked this linen bag a lot and often carried it around.\u201cIt\u2019s 11:12:16 at night.\u201d Chen Yang glanced at his watch and said, \u201cAt this time, you should be sleeping at your school dorm.\u201d [T/N: yes, he said the seconds too]\u201cHuh??\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s guilty eyes moved around restlessly, but her eyes were too big and her guilty conscience was too obvious.\u201cTell the truth.\u201d Chen Yang knew that she was going to lie as soon as her eyes moved around.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 with classmates\u2026\u201d\u201cI have your dorm\u2019s phone number.\u201d Without waiting for Chen Yu to finish her words, Chen Yang ruthlessly broke apart the excuses Chen Yu had finally come up with, but failed to finish saying.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yu stuttered, her hands were clutching her clothes, her eyes were shifting everywhere.\u201cBrother Yang, I found it.\u201d Just when Chen Yu was at a loss, a man in his early twenties walked out from a 24-hour convenience store. Chen Yu could tell from his faint righteous aura that he was also a policeman.\u201cThis store installed a CCTV in the alley, I checked it, it\u2019s good, but it can only store video from the last seven days.\u201d The young policeman handed the video backup to Chen Yang.Chen Yang took the video backup, looked at it and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s take a look at the content tonight.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d The young policeman glanced at the girl who stood next to Chen Yang in surprise, \u201cThis is?\u201d\u201cThis is my sister, Chen Yu.\u201d Chen Yang introduced her in passing.\u201cHello.\u201d Chen Yu smiled and shook his hand.\u201cHello.\u201d The young policeman replied with a smile.Chen Yang saw it was almost midnight and he had to return to the office to investigate the newly obtained surveillance video, there\u2019s basically no time for him to send his sister home. Thinking of this, he frowned and glanced at Chen Yu, \u201cGet in the car.\u201d\u201cGo\u2026 go where?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cPolice station.\u201d Chen Yang raised his hand and opened the back seat door.\u201cI didn\u2019t break the law, ah!\u201d Chen Yu said reflexively.TL NOTE:Lol, little fish, you ded \u2220( \u141b \u300d\u2220)\uff3fPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chen Yang placed Chen Yu in his seat and said, \u201cSit here and don\u2019t run around.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu obediently nodded her head.Chen Yu sat bored for a while, when all of a sudden someone came over with a cup of milk tea. Chen Yu looked up in surprise and saw it was the young policeman.\u201cMy name\u2019s Qiu Heng, I have been following your brother since I graduated from police academy.\u201d Qiu Heng then asked with a smile, \u201cWhy were you out so late? Did you go to a bar or internet caf\u00e9 secretly?\u201dChen Yu weighed the two and chose the latter, \u201cI went to an internet caf\u00e9.\u201d\u201cInternet caf\u00e9? It\u2019s dangerous for girls to be outside, no wonder Brother Yang is angry.\u201d Qiu Heng saw Chen Yu\u2019s neat and tidy appearance, like someone who can be easily taken advantage of, so he couldn\u2019t help but warn, \u201cIt\u2019s not safe recently, you\u2019re this beautiful, an easy target for bad guys.\u201d\u201cWere you catching bad guys now?\u201d Chen Yu asked curiously.\u201cAhh, there have been several wounding incidents over there, the perpetrator hasn\u2019t been caught, so we\u2019re looking for evidence. That place isn\u2019t very safe, you should go there less frequently.\u201d Qiu Heng pushed the milk tea forward again and continued, \u201cDrink something first, wait for your brother to come out later and apologize, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201dAfter saying this, Qiu Heng turned around, left the office and walked towards the evidence room.After a while, Chen Yang walked out from the room. He looked at his sister who was sitting in a chair, obediently drinking milk tea and he couldn\u2019t help but frown. He dragged a chair over and sat down, \u201cHave you thought about what you want to say to me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 Brother, I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t sneak out to play games anymore.\u201d Chen Yu apologized pitifully.\u201cPlaying games?\u201d Chen Yang asked in surprise.\u201cI promise, I\u2019ll study hard and never indulge in games anymore.\u201d Chen Yu said reassuringly.\u201cYou ran out at night to play games at an internet caf\u00e9?\u201d Chen Yang doubted, \u201cThen why were you in that alley in the middle of the night?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I was hungry, I planned to have supper and go back and buy an all-night package.\u201d Chen Yu said cautiously. [T/N: for those who don\u2019t know, there\u2019s an all-night package that you can buy in internet caf\u00e9, you can play / sleep all night long in there]\u201cYou still want to buy an all-night package?\u201d the blue veins in Chen Yang\u2019s forehead burst, \u201cIt\u2019s Monday.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I was wrong, I won\u2019t do this again in the future.\u201d Chen Yu said with puppy-eyes.Chen Yang held back his anger, but when he met his sister\u2019s pitiful eyes, his heart became soft again. Thinking his sister had grown up in the backward and impoverished mountainous area for more than ten years and had never been in touch with games, it\u2019s actually pardonable she would feel games were interesting. Hadn\u2019t he been addicted to them when he was a teenager too?When Chen Yang thought about it this way, most of his anger was immediately gone leaving only distress in his heart, \u201cFinal exams are coming soon.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 en.\u201d Chen Yu nodded her head without understanding why.\u201cPlaying games is okay, but you shouldn\u2019t let it hinder your studies.\u201d Chen Yang said, \u201cIf you do well in the finals, I\u2019ll give you a gaming computer later, if you want to play, don\u2019t go to an Internet Caf\u00e9 in the middle of the night.\u201d\u201cThere\u2026 there\u2019s no need.\u201d From being criticized heavily to suddenly being encouraged and rewarded with a computer, Chen Yu felt the change was too fast and she couldn\u2019t accept it.\u201cDo you still want to go to an Internet Caf\u00e9 in the middle of the night?\u201d Chen Yang\u2019s voice sank again.\u201cNot going.\u201d Chen Yu immediately made her attitude clear.Chen Yang rubbed his eyebrows, he raised his head and said, \u201cI still have a case to work on tonight so I can\u2019t take you home. You can stay in the police dorm for one night and go back to school tomorrow morning.\u201dChen Yu stayed in the police dorm, the next morning she ran to the police station to say goodbye to her brother. She found an exhausted looking Chen Yang, it looked like he hadn\u2019t slept all night, so Chen Yu didn\u2019t dare bother him anymore and left after saying goodbye.She walked along a road and saw a stall selling breakfast, Chen Yu thought for a while, ran and bought a dozen*, then found someone to send them in to her brother. Thinking her elder brother wouldn\u2019t miss breakfast now, she finally could walk away with peace. [T/N: probs a dozen buns]When passing by yesterday\u2019s alley, Chen Yu saw the female perverted ghost who was trying to molest her brother last night. She became angry and strode past, dragging the ghost into the nearby alley and angrily said, \u201cIf I catch you molesting my brother again, I\u2019ll burn you with a talisman.\u201d\u201cCelestial Master, please have mercy, ah, I don\u2019t dare, I will never do that anymore.\u201d In fact, the ghost waited here to apologize to Chen Yu, \u201cI really didn\u2019t know that superbly dashing guy is your brother, ah.\u201dSeeing the ghost was really scared, Chen Yu softened her stance and said, \u201cSay, haven\u2019t you gotten tired of molesting people? You can almost enter reincarnation.\u201d\u201cCelestial Master, what you said is too simple, lonely, wandering souls like us who missed the spirit gate, how could we get a good reincarnation.\u201d The female perverted ghost said pitifully, \u201cI would be caught and sent to jail for several years, I also don\u2019t know which level of the eighteenth hell I would be locked in. When I was alive, I would at most get scolded if I was caught stealing a kiss or two, I never thought the punishment would be more serious after death, that it would directly affect my next reincarnation.\u201d\u201cThen, what are you going to do? Keep on being a wandering lonely ghost?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cHow can that be? When I have successfully collected 999 handsome men, I will seek a Celestial Master to transcend.\u201d The female perverted ghost glanced at Chen Yu after she said these words. Although she was thrown away like a rag twice, Chen Yu was really the most sensible Celestial Master she had ever seen. When other Celestial Masters saw her, either they would try to exorcise her without saying anything, or they would earnestly persuade her not to molest handsome guys and go reincarnate.Only Chen Yu was different, not only didn\u2019t she exorcise her, she also didn\u2019t prevent her from taking advantage of handsome guys.Thinking of this, the ghost suddenly flatteringly smiled, \u201cLittle Celestial Master, can you wait for me to collect 999 handsome guys? I will then come to you and you can help me transcend.\u201d\u201cYou can wish, but my skill is really expensive.\u201d Chen Yu refused without thinking twice.Old Wu taught Chen Yu from an early age that she must collect money when she drives away ghosts because everything should have a price. Chen Yu had followed Old Wu since she was young, naturally she had seen a lot of lonely, harmless ghosts wandering in the world. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t want to reincarnate, it\u2019s because they had missed the time to enter the spirit gate.Of course, they can surrender themselves to the Town God or wait until the Spirit Gate opens again, but because they delayed entering the Underworld, they will be punished once they enter. However, if those lonely ghosts can slip past the errand ghosts\u2019 inspection, then the punishment can be avoided, this was also a kind of transcending.When she was young, Chen Yu had always felt those lonely ghosts were pitiful, so she always begged the old man to help these ghosts transcend. Every time she did it, the old man always said with earnest words: \u201cNo matter if it's a man or ghost, everything has to pay a price. They missed the Spirit Gate\u2019s opening time because of their own reasons, and since they planted the cause, then they have to bear the fruit. We\u2019re exorcists, not Lei Feng.\u201d [T/N: spirit of altruism]\u201cI\u2019m not Lei Feng!\u201d Chen Yu added.\u201cThat\u2026\u201d the female ghost remembered the two policemen who ran here to handle a case in the middle of the night and suddenly thought, \u201cLittle Celestial Master, I know who the criminal is in your brother\u2019s case.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Chen Yu glanced at her.\u201cI can help the policeman brother catch the bad guy, as a reward, when I want to reincarnate someday, will you help me transcend?\u201d The ghost suggested.Chen Yu wanted to refuse, but the thought of her elder brother\u2019s haggard appearance this morning made her frown.Forget it, just treat it as repayment for her brother giving her a computer. Besides, this ghost isn\u2019t that annoying.\u201cOk. If you help my brother catch the bad guy within a day, then I\u2019ll help you pass on for free once.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cIt\u2019s settled!\u201d the female ghost widened her eyes in happy surprise.Chen Yu took out a Sensor Talisman from her pocket and gave it to the ghost, \u201cI\u2019m a Celestial Master, nicknamed Exorcist Xishi. Put your Yin aura into this sensor talisman when you want to reincarnate.\u201d\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d The ghost quickly took the talisman.\u201cOf course, this is with the premise that you can catch the bad guy today.\u201d Chen Yu reminded her.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d The ghost vowed solemnly.Chen Yu looked at the time, it was almost time for her first class so she stopped paying attention to the perverted ghost, turned around and ran out the alley quickly towards Imperial University.After Chen Yu left, a child suddenly appeared in the empty alley besides the female ghost. The child looked to be about seven or eight years old, and he looked very cute in his little suit. He walked out of the wall and stood beside the female ghost.\u201cSister Weiwei, are you going to reincarnate?\u201d The little boy looked at the talisman paper in the female ghost\u2019s hand curiously.\u201cXiaokang, ah, where\u2019s your brother?\u201d she smiled once she saw the little boy.\u201cBrother doesn\u2019t want to come out.\u201d Xiaokang pointed to the wall and spoke.A pitiful look flashed in the female ghost\u2019s eyes; she can\u2019t see this superbly handsome man, ah. She squeezed the little boy\u2019s face and said, \u201cSister won\u2019t get reincarnated now, sister has not gathered 999 handsome men yet.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Xiaokang looked at the female ghost enviously.Chen Yu kept a low profile after being caught by her elder brother. When she went out at night, she avoided police cars, fearing she would meet her elder brother again. Apart from this, what\u2019s more pressing was that she originally just wanted to barely pass her final exam, but because her brother said she should do her exam well, Chen Yu felt an indescribable nervousness.How many points do you need to be counted as good? Eighty, ninety?\u00a0Chen Yu felt despondent while studying in the library, finals would start in a week, she might be able to get eighty, but ninety was very unlikely, ah.\u201cLittle Celestial Master, little Celestial Master.\u201d The sudden interruption stopped Chen Yu from reviewing her notes. She calmly stood up and walked outside the reading room.\u201cPervert ghost?\u201d She only gave out one Sensor Talisman.\u201cLittle Celestial Master, can you come over now?\u201d The female ghost\u2019s anxious voice sounded in Chen Yu\u2019s mind.\u201cDo you want me to transcend you?\u201d The female ghost helped Chen Yang catch the criminal on time, so Chen Yu owed her this help.\u201cRight, right, right!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in the library now and I don\u2019t have anything with me. I\u2019ll go to you tomorrow during the day.\u201d Her compass was needed to open the Spirit Gate, but she left it behind in the dorm because she didn\u2019t pick up any tasks recently to prepare for her finals.\u201cNo! It must be tonight, please!\u201d The female ghost pleaded.Chen Yu frowned slightly, but she\u2019s always a person who kept her promises. She thought about it, walked back to the reading room, picked up her books and went back to her dorm room. She held a linen bag while wearing a thick down-jacket and went to the alley near the convenience store.Because there were some wounding cases not so long ago, people were still reluctant to walk along this alley even though the criminal was caught,When Chen Yu entered the alley, the female perverted ghost impatiently welcomed her.\u201cLittle Celestial Master!\u201dChen Yu ignored the female ghost but carefully looked at the alley and soon found an array painted with cinnabar on the wall.Chen Yu suddenly realized, \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re in a hurry to reincarnate, as it turns out, you\u2019re being targeted by someone.\u201dChen Yu felt a very uncomfortable aura as soon as she entered the alley, so she followed this aura\u2019s direction to discover such an array.\u201cSoul Refining Array, there\u2019s actually a Celestial Master who targets you at your cultivation level.\u201d Chen Yu felt that it was unfathomable, \u201cYou know, drawing a Soul Refining Array requires quite a lot of spiritual energy, it\u2019s truthfully like killing a chicken using an ox knife to use this array just to kill a weak perverted ghost like you.\u201d\u201cYou know about Soul Refining Array?\u201d a clear male voice suddenly sounded.Chen Yu backed up two steps as she raised her eyes to look at the opposite wall. Two ghosts, one large and one small, suddenly appeared from the wall. Chen Yu\u2019s heart was startled as she didn\u2019t even notice there were two ghosts around.\u201cYou know about Soul Refining Array?\u201d The slightly older ghost was an eighteen to nineteen-year-old boy who looked better than idol stars that appeared on TV. He looked straight at Chen Yu and repeated the question again.Chen Yu felt a fiendish aura hitting her face directly, she alertly looked at the young man and quietly took out an advanced-level Expelling Talisman from her bag with her fingers.\u201cLittle Celestial Master, we don\u2019t want to fight.\u201d The female ghost was shocked when she saw Chen Yu take out a talisman and shouted with a loud voice.\u201cYou guys are together?\u201d Chen Yu asked with certainty.\u201cYes.\u201d The female ghost ran to calm the teenager ghost, \u201cXiang Nan, we\u2019re asking for someone\u2019s help, don\u2019t be so impulsive.\u201dThe young man named Xiang Nan was taken aback for a moment, then looked down at the little boy beside him. All of a sudden, the hostile aura that surrounded him was reduced by a lot.Although Chen Yu was a little curious, her intuition was telling her this was definitely sticky trouble that can\u2019t be shaken off, so she looked at the female ghost and said, \u201cYou, come out with me, I\u2019ll transcend you now.\u201dJust finish early and leave early.The female ghost and Xiang Nan looked at each other, and then walked out from the alley with the little boy in hand.Soul Refining Array, evil spirit, although Chen Yu wasn\u2019t clear what happened before, but as long as she wasn\u2019t blind, she knows it\u2019s big trouble. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to care whether she had money or not. Seeing the female ghost coming out, Chen Yu raised her hand and threw the compass, and soon a Spirit Gate with glowing green light appeared in front of the three ghosts.Xiang Nan\u2019s gaze trembled. The female ghost took the little boy\u2019s hand and slowly approached the Spirit Gate, she pushed the little boy in while Chen Yu wasn\u2019t paying attention.Bam!A golden light flashed, and the little boy was ejected far away along with the female ghost.\u201cXiaokang!\u201d Xiangnan ran towards the entrance of the alley anxiously, but he couldn\u2019t go any further.Chen Yu retracted her compass and looked at the two ghosts lying on the ground with a complicated expression.There are ghosts that Underworld won\u2019t accept?!Author\u2019s NOTE:The internal communication group of assistants.\u201cMs. Chen Yu said she will kiss Third Young Master again.\u201d\u201cThird Young Master seems to be spending money on this.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this basically spending money for someone to take advantage of yourself?\u201dTL NOTE:Hmm\u2026 what\u2019s the deal with the child ghost?

Although Chen Yu already guessed this, she didn\u2019t stop them. After all, transcending one ghost or two ghosts was the same as she only had to open the Spirit Gate once, so she opened one eye and closed another about this matter.But what she didn\u2019t expect was that the Spirit Gate would reject the little boy.Chen Yu felt the female ghost\u2019s yin aura when she opened the Spirit Gate; this proved the gate recognized the female ghost, thus when the light rebounded, the only explanation could only be the little boy who was \u2018smuggled in\u2019 was the one who wasn\u2019t recognized by Underworld.\u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d Following a loud roar, Chen Yu felt a vicious hostility attacking from her side. Chen Yu drew sideways and raised her hand to send an advanced-level Expelling Talisman.The advanced-level Expelling Talisman stopped in front of the teenager, and burned after shaking twice, its yellow flame was particularly eye-catching in the dark of the night.\u201cYellow?\u201d Chen Yu raised her head as she gazed at the teenager to probe deeper.Xiang Nan gave Chen Yu a deathly stare, his dark and beautiful eyes glowed with scarlet light as they alternated between black and a bloody red color. This was the changing between a ghost\u2019s reason and resentment, if he loses his mind completely, then his evil aura will take over.For a few seconds, Chen Yu observed the teenager who was standing in the alley, and as if she discovered something, she suddenly turned and walked towards the female pervert and the little boy.\u201cWhat are you doing!!\u201d Xiang Nan watched Chen Yu\u2019s action; his eyes turned completely red while a huge hostile aura rose into the sky.\u201cBrother Xiangnan!\u201d The little boy called out in worry.\u201cXiangnan!\u201d The female ghost also shouted anxiously.With the sudden appearance of so much hostility, the array on the wall suddenly emitted a faint red light, and slowly absorbed the hostile aura.Chen Yu walked up to the female pervert and little boy, the female ghost blocked the little boy behind her and stammered nervously, \u201cLittle\u2026 Celestial Master Chen, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I, I didn\u2019t mean to deceive you.\u201dThe female ghost didn\u2019t dare call Chen Yu Little Celestial Master at this moment.\u201cIf you dare touch them, I won\u2019t let you go even if my soul disperses.\u201d Xiangnan threatened harshly behind her, but he didn\u2019t leave the alley.Chen Yu turned around and looked at the teenager\u2019s unmoving position, confirming her guess, \u201cYou can\u2019t get out from there.\u201dAs soon as Chen Yu\u2019s voice fell, the three ghosts present were all startled.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d When Xiangnan saw that Chen Yu found out, he no longer concealed it, \u201cBut if you dare to hurt them, I will\u2026\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t let me go even if your soul disperses, you said that already.\u201d Chen Yu repeated.\u201c\u2026\u201d Xiangnan was choked by Chen Yu\u2019s words, his expression turned ugly.Afraid of inciting conflict between the two again, the female ghost quickly explained, \u201cCelestial Master Chen, you promised to help me transcend once, transcending Xiaokang is just the same. I won\u2019t reincarnate, can you give this chance to Xiaokang?\u201dChen Yu\u2019s gaze slid back and forth between the female ghost and little boy before resting on the female ghost, \u201cDo you think I didn\u2019t let him reincarnate?\u201dThe female ghost didn\u2019t speak, but her expression clearly said she thought so.\u201cDo you know how much spiritual power it takes to open the Spirit Gate?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The female ghost shook her head innocently, she\u2019s not a celestial master, ah.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yu became stiff as she felt she asked a silly question, she pondered a bit and took out her phone to explain, \u201cTake this phone for example, if my spiritual power is 100% battery, then when I open Spirit Gate once, it will consume 50% of the power, furthermore I need to spend 5% more to purify your resentment.\u201d\u201cI have used up 50% of my battery, do you think I\u2019d close the Spirit Gate just because you bought an extra kid?\u201d Chen Yu said speechlessly.\u201cThen\u2026 why was that\u2026?\u201d After the golden burst, the Spirit Gate suddenly closed shut, so the female ghost thought Chen Yu was the one who closed it.\u201cBecause of this kid?\u201d Chen Yu pointed to the little boy and said, \u201cThe Underworld won\u2019t accept him.\u201d\u201cThe Underworld won\u2019t accept him? What does it mean \u2018won\u2019t accept\u2019?\u201d the female ghost asked full of confusion.\u201cIt means you can\u2019t transcend, you can\u2019t reincarnate.\u201d Chen Yu explained in a simple way.\u201cImpossible!\u201d The female ghost shouted in agitation as she pulled the little boy closer, \u201cCelestial Master, ah, look at Xiaokang, he has no resentment, he has not harmed anyone, has not done anything wrong, why can\u2019t he reincarnate? Why won't the Underworld receive him? Isn\u2019t it just evil spirits that have harmed people that are unable to reincarnate? Why Xiaokang?\u201dChen Yu naturally can see the problem pointed out by the female ghost, the little boy\u2019s aura was very clean, a clean soul without a thread of injustice would be given preferential treatment when they reincarnate in Underworld. It\u2019s precisely for this reason that Chen Yu was willing to push the boat along the river and send the little boy off along with the female ghost, but she hadn\u2019t expected this situation to occur.\u201cSister Celestial Master, did Xiaokang do something wrong?\u201d The little boy raised his head, looking at Chen Yu with watery eyes and asked faintly.\u201cI also don\u2019t know.\u201d Chen Yu felt uncomfortable as she was dazzled by the boy\u2019s clean eyes, she shook her head and said, \u201cBut the Spirit Gate closed automatically, it really means that it won\u2019t accept you.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Xiaokang nodded, he let go of the female ghost\u2019s hand, ran towards the alley and grabbed the teenager\u2019s hand and said, \u201cBrother Xiangnan, since the Underworld doesn\u2019t want Xiaokang, then Xiaokang will stay here to accompany you.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Xiangnan felt that Chen Yu wouldn\u2019t harm them, so his violent aura calmed down. However, this time when he heard Xiaokang\u2019s words, the violent aura started to go awry again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Believe It Or Not, I Already Caught YouCH 40.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40 - 2: Spirit Refining ArrayThe array drawn on the wall glowed red again, the absorption speed was even faster than the previous time.\u201cCome on, you should calm down, the Soul Refining Array has been activated again.\u201d Chen Yu reminded.Xiang Nan was startled, he glanced at Chen Yu as the aura around him slowly receded. Chen Yu walked to the alley past the two ghosts, right up to the wall where the array was drawn, and slowly squatted down.Chen Yu raised her hand and touched the cinnabar drawn pattern lines, there were traces of faint aura around it and it was clear that it had indeed been activated just now. When Chen Yu first discovered this Soul Refining Array, she thought that there\u2019s a celestial master who had deep hatred towards the female ghost and spent such great effort to clean her up, but now, it seemed the ghost the other party wanted to refine was obviously this young man with an exceedingly formidable cultivation.\u201cWhat the heck are you looking at?\u201d Xiang Nan hated all Celestial Masters.\u201cHow long have you been dead?\u201d Chen Yu asked out of nowhere.\u201cIt has nothing to do with you!\u201d Xiang Nan roared with an unkind expression.It was the first time for Chen Yu to be spoken fiercely by a ghost that her temper suddenly flared up, \u201cForget it, then!\u201dChen Yu patted her hands a few times and stood up, turned around and walked out of the alley. When passing by the female ghost, she said, \u201cI opened the Spirit Gate for you, you\u2019re the one who messed it up yourself, so it\u2019s even between us.\u201d\u201cCelestial Master Chen.\u201d The female ghost wanted to say something, but she didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cAh, that\u2019s right.\u201d Chen Yu thought a bit and reminded her, \u201cYou and that kid, move farther away from that alley, be careful of being affected.\u201d\u201cCelestial Master, can you help us erase the Soul Refining Array?\u201d Seeing that Chen Yu was about to leave, the female ghost became anxious and floated to Chen Yu to beg.\u201cErase it? Are you treating it as a chalk drawing that you can wipe whenever you want, ah?\u201d Chen Yu was almost speechless.Soul Refining Array was a medium for a Celestial Master to subdue ghosts. When a Celestial Master encounters a ghost with a high cultivation level that\u2019s unwilling to reincarnate, they can make a contract with the ghost to restrict it from harming others while at the same time serving under them. The ghosts who work for a Celestial Master won\u2019t be chased or killed by other Celestial Masters.This kind of contract was relatively equal with both the Celestial Master and evil ghost receiving mutual benefits, but a Soul Refining Array was different as it was one-sided. Once the Soul Refining Array was drawn successfully, no matter whether the evil spirit was willing or not, they must obey the Celestial Master, and once their soul was completely refined, the evil spirit would forever lose the qualification to reincarnate.When the Celestial Master who subdued him returned to the Underworld [dead], if no one took over the Celestial Master\u2019s role within 49 days, the ghost\u2019s soul would scatter and perish from existence.Chen Yu nor the old man ever made any contract with an evil spirit. According to the old man\u2019s words, most evil spirits are surrounded by resentment, regardless of their character during their lifetime, after death, the evil spirit\u2019s temperament would be affected by resentment and become perverse and cruel. It\u2019s much better just to properly cultivate oneself through austerities than making any contract with an evil spirit.Although ghosts refined by Soul Refining Arrays had no such problems, Chen Yu never thought of doing that even once. Even when she came to Imperial Capital and found that exorcising ghosts could make a lot of money, this thought never passed her mind.Whether it\u2019s a person or a ghost, they\u2019re both individuals with their own thinking and feeling. Growing up as a student from a famous university in the new society, Chen Yu really couldn\u2019t do such an evil act as if she was signing a slave contract. Moreover, once she did soul refining, she had to find a ritual instrument to house the ghost. As long as Chen Yu thought she would be accompanied by a ghost who truly hated her to death every day and every second of her life, Chen Yu felt her stomach churn in revolt.\u201cCelestial Master Chen, you\u2019re also a Celestial Master, you must have a way, right?\u201d The female ghost begged.Chen Yu showed signs of hesitation. In the spiritual world, Spirit Refining Array was something that everyone tacitly approved of, after all, the objects to be refined were extremely hostile spirits. Most of these ghosts have killed people, so they didn\u2019t warrant sympathy even if they\u2019re refined to nothingness. Furthermore, to be able to refine a soul is the Celestial Master\u2019s own capability.\u201cI can\u2019t destroy the array, it\u2019s tantamount to provoking the Celestial Master who drew it.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cBut\u2026 but that Celestial Master is a bad person, ah.\u201d The female ghost hastily said.\u201cFrom the perspective of living human beings, the Celestial Master is exorcising an evil spirit, thus doing a good deed.\u201d Chen Yu continued.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t beg her!\u201d The female ghost wanted to say something more, but Xiang Nan suddenly walked over and pulled her back. He looked at Chen Yu and said with a cold expression, \u201cYou can go.\u201d\u201cXiang Nan, don\u2019t do this.\u201d The female ghost tried to break away from Xiang Nan\u2019s restraint, but she couldn\u2019t do it no matter what. She tried to call Chen Yu again, but Chen Yu had walked out of the alley without looking back.Because Chen Yu had left, the female ghost almost cried, \u201cXiang Nan, what are you going to do then?\u201d\u201cNo need for you to worry about it!\u201d Xiang Nan\u2019s expression was still cold.\u201cI don\u2019t need to worry? All right, I won\u2019t care about you, but what about Xiaokang?\u201d The female ghost asked.Xiang Nan\u2019s eyes flashed and the condensed coldness on his face loosened. He looked at the little boy standing by obediently, gritted his teeth and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll leave here with Xiaokang tomorrow.\u201d\u201cBrother, I won\u2019t go!\u201d When Xiaokang heard that Xiang Nan was going to let him leave again, he immediately rushed over and hugged Xiang Nan\u2019s long legs.\u201cWhere can we go?\u201d The female ghost said desperately, \u201cSending Xiaokang to reincarnate is the only way, but now Xiaokang can\u2019t even go to the Underworld, even if he leaves this alley, that person will still chase after him.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t let him chase you.\u201d Xiang Nan gritted his teeth determinedly.\u201cYou won\u2019t let him chase us? Although you\u2019re great, you can\u2019t leave this alley.\u201d The female ghost said, \u201cThat person will threaten you with Xiaokang because you can\u2019t leave. You can\u2019t kill him; you can only let him refine your soul!\u201d\u201cAt any rate, I have waited in this alley long enough, even if I\u2019m being refined by him, at worst I\u2019ll perish along with him.\u201d Xiang Nan said coldly.\u201cAre you willing? If you\u2019re okay with your soul being scattered, then why did you cultivate so hard for so many years?\u201d the female ghost asked.\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t need you to worry about it!\u201d Xiang Nan shouted impatiently.\u201cThen I won\u2019t care whether you die or not, this old lady sees you\u2019re good looking, that\u2019s all.\u201d The female ghost was also furious at Xiang Nan, she turned around and ran out of the alley.\u201cBrother Xiang Nan, Sister Weiwei is angry.\u201d Xiaokang raised his head and said in a small voice.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, she will be back soon.\u201d Xiang Nan knelt down and said to the little boy, \u201cWhen she comes back, you will leave with her.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to go; I want to stay with Brother.\u201d Xiaokang shook his head desperately.\u201cListen to me!\u201d Xiang Nan suddenly loudly berated so Xiaokang lowered his head, not daring to speak anymore.The compass used up a lot of spiritual energy when it opened the Spirit Gate. Maybe because there\u2019s a place with ample spiritual energy like the Lou family\u2019s small courtyard, the compass became so delicate that once its spiritual energy was low, it would buzz and make noises demanding to go to the Lou family\u2019s small courtyard and replenish its energy. Chen Yu was preparing for finals and she became very irritable when she was studying. She originally planned on not going home before the finals were over, but she was so annoyed by the compass\u2019 crying that she was forced to gather all of her textbooks and take over Lou Ming\u2019s study room.Lou Ming looked at the textbooks Chen Yu brought over, English, math, computer science, philosophy\u2026 Lou Min seriously suspected she had moved all the freshman subjects to his place.\u201cWhy do you have to review so much?\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help asking.\u201cI was busy making money in the second half of the semester so I didn\u2019t have any time to study.\u201d In order to upgrade her account as soon as possible, Chen Yu kept going out at night to exorcise ghosts, it\u2019s no wonder she slept in class during the day.Making money?\u00a0Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help frowning and reminding her, \u201cImperial University has a drop-out system if you fail.\u201d\u201cI know, Third Brother, don\u2019t worry, I will definitely not drop out.\u201d Chen Yu said as she took a slice of orange from the fruit place next to her and complained, \u201cThird Brother, how come your heat is set so high? I\u2019m sweating like crazy.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re feeling hot? Let\u2019s turn on the air conditioning.\u201d Lou Ming said, his hand was about to get remote control.\u201cWhy should we turn on the air conditioner? Just open the window, ah.\u201d Chen Yu said.Lou Ming chuckled, he turned around, walked to the window and opened it. A gust of cold wind blew in as soon as the window was open. Lou Ming\u2019s body shivered uncontrollably and he quickly supported himself on the windowsill so he could stabilize himself. Isn\u2019t there a few days left before winter solstice? Why is it so cold today?\u00a0Lou Ming took two deep breaths, and after adapting to the cold, he turned around and walked away, pretending to be nonchalant, \u201cI\u2019m going out, review your lessons properly.\u201d\u201cEn, thanks Third Brother. Ah, right, Third Brother, I want to eat boiled fish tonight.\u201d Chen Yu said to Lou Ming who was at the door.\u201cOkay.\u201d Without looking back, Lou Ming reached out and closed the study\u2019s door.Cheng Peng had brought up the tea when he saw Lou Ming leaning against the door with his head lowered. He was shocked to see this so he put the tea cups on the floor and quickly ran towards Lou Ming, \u201cThird Young Master.\u201dLou Ming raised his head slightly, a layer of white frost formed on his eyebrows.Cheng Peng knew what was going on as soon as he saw the frost, so he dared not delay and immediately supported the almost frozen Lou Ming back to his room. He covered Lou Ming with a thick quilt, turned on three high-powered electric heaters in front of the bed, and poured out several cups of hot water for Lou Ming to drink before Lou Ming\u2019s complexion eased somewhat.\u201cDid you open the window?\u201d Although Cheng Peng asked a question, he\u2019s already sure of the answer.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Lou Ming said nonchalantly.\u201cYou clearly know that you can\u2019t have cold air blowing on you in winter.\u201d Cheng Peng said anxiously.\u201cI thought there\u2019d be no problem today.\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cYou obviously know the winter solstice is coming soon, was it Miss Chen Yu?\u201d Actually, he didn\u2019t need Third Young Master to answer because he knew the answer himself.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d Lou Ming defended her.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go tell her that she can\u2019t open the window here in the winter.\u201d Cheng Peng was about to leave after he said this.\u201cCome back here!\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s face suddenly became heavy.Cheng Peng gritted his teeth, but he still stopped in the end.\u201cI\u2019ll tell her myself; you\u2019re not allowed to go.\u201d If you tell her now, then she will surely guess his condition.The evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body was most active in spring and quietest in winter, but there\u2019s a hidden danger in the winter. If the evil energy was affected by the cold winter air, his whole body would freeze from within. Master Mao still couldn\u2019t figure out the reason after studying it for a long time, the only conclusion he could come up with was the evil spirit inside him would sleep if Lou Ming was exposed to cold winter air, and it would return to normal once the winter solstice ended.\u201cThen, please rest well, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d Cheng Peng couldn\u2019t keep on insisting after he heard Lou Ming say this.\u201cBy the way, prepare boiled fish for dinner.\u201d Lou Ming suddenly said.Cheng Peng\u2019s facial expression that just calmed down began twitching, Third Young Master never ordered any food, this boiled fish must have been prepared for the fish in the study room. [T/N: lol, Chen Yu\u2019s Yu means \u2018fish\u2019]On the other side, the seriously studying Chen Yu suddenly received news from the old man.I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018You\u2019re right, if the Expelling Talisman burned a yellow flame, it proves the ghost is being refined. Refining spirits is quite rare these days, where did you see it?\u2019A few days ago, Chen Yu saw when the advanced Expelling Talisman met Xiang Nan\u2019s hostile aura, it turned into a yellow flame and she guessed that Xiang Nan was a ghost that\u2019s being refined, so she couldn\u2019t help asking the old man to verify this.I Want to Fix Road: \u2018So it\u2019s indeed Soul Refining, but it\u2019s clearly only one evil spirit ah.\u2019I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018Baka, can\u2019t an evil spirit cultivate anymore? If an evil spirit with a high cultivation base succeeds in cultivating, then they may even become ghost kings. If they do good deeds several times, then maybe they can pass off as Underworld\u2019s messenger, oh.\u2019 [T/N: not sure with this translation]Chen Yu was half dead with anger, she wanted to verbally attack the old man but didn\u2019t know how to do it. She was so angry she wanted to smash things, ah, when she was looking for something to smash, she saw Lou Ming\u2019s picture on the desk. She returned to her senses in the twinkling of an eye and quickly asked, \u2018Old man, how long will you be on? I have something to ask you.\u2019I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018I saw your message, what\u2019s the matter? Say it here, I haven\u2019t bought a mobile phone yet, oh.\u2019I Want to Fix Road: \u2018Go lie to dead people!\u2019I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018Ask now if you want to ask, if you don\u2019t ask then I\u2019ll hang up.\u2019Chen Yu saw the old man was so blunt and rude that she had to repeatedly rap the table and take a deep breath several times before she asked, \u2018I met a man, the evil spirit in his body is even worse than a zombie, old man, do you know what\u2019s going on?\u2019I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018The evil spirit in a person\u2019s body is even worse than a zombie?\u2019I Want to Fix Road: \u2018Yes.\u2019I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018Quick, be buddy-buddy with him, let him provide you with energy to draw talismans.\u2019Chen Yu was stifled: \u2018Old man!!!!!\u2019I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018Although I\u2019ve seen my share of people with evil spirits, but I have never seen such a heavy one, ah. Actually, I\u2019m quite curious about how he survived until now, a murder weapon like him, those old codgers in the spiritual world would have disposed of him before he grows up, ah.\u2019Dispose !!Chen Yu thought this word was simply too harsh: \u2018Can you do something about it?\u2019I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018No!\u2019I Want to Fix Road: \u2018Aren\u2019t you amazingly good?\u2019I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018Although Grandpa is glad you adore me so much, but this grandpa is also a mortal, ah.\u2019Chen Yu was so angry she wanted to smash her phone: \u2018Then, come to Imperial City, come see this person yourself and make a judgement.\u2019I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018Neither relative nor friend, why should I run so far for nothing, ah?\u2019Chen Yu pressed her fingers quickly: \u2018He\u2019s my friend.\u2019I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018Still not a boyfriend!\u2019I\u2019m Big Account: \u2018I\u2019m off!\u2019Chen Yu saw the profile picture had turned gray, then her angry shouts could be heard from the study, \u201cDead old man!

After he said \u2018enjoy your meal\u2019, he immediately walked away.Chen Yu looked at the empty dining room and felt something wasn\u2019t right. Normally, even if Third Brother wasn\u2019t hungry, he would still sit and eat a few bites to accompany her, why was it so different today?Chen Yu ate absent-mindedly; she didn\u2019t even eat the boiled fish she had asked for as she barely ate a bowl of rice. Pondering about it for a while, Chen Yu then got up and walked to Lou Ming\u2019s bedroom on the second floor.Chen Peng saw her but didn\u2019t stop her after a brief hesitation, because he knew although Third Young Master was sick because of Chen Yu, he would still be happy seeing her.Chen Yu walked to Lou Ming\u2019s bedroom door, raised her hand and knocked a few times, \u201cThird Brother.\u201d\u201cCome in.\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s voice sounded from behind the door.Chen Yu opened the door and found Lou Min leaning on the headboard as he read a book. Although his handsome face was smiling, his mental state was obviously not very good, \u201cBrother, are you feeling uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cJust a bit of a cold.\u201d Lou Ming put down the book in his hand and explained, \u201cMaybe I caught a cold last night.\u201d\u201cYour heating system is good, \u00a0how can you catch a cold, ah?\u201d Chen Yu found it strange.Lou Ming blanked, as he was about to make an excuse, he heard Chen Yu say, \u201cDid you feel hot like me so you secretly opened a window?\u201dLou Ming smiled and nodded in acquiescence.\u201cThird Brother, how can you do that?\u201d Chen Yu pretended to be serious in order to give Lou Ming a lesson, \u201cIt's okay to open a window during the day, but you will definitely catch a cold when you sleep with the window open at night, this is something that all children know, ah.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d This was the first time Lou Ming had been criticized like this, but it didn\u2019t feel bad at all.\u201cDo you have a fever?\u201dLou Ming was about to answer when \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a soft warm palm was suddenly placed on his forehead, making him freeze in place.\u201cI don\u2019t feel one, ah.\u201d Chen Yu tested Lou Ming\u2019s temperature with the palm of her hand, but it wasn\u2019t really clear, so she took back her hand and lowered her head, using her forehead to directly feel his.Lou Ming subconsciously wanted to avoid her.\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Chen Yu pressed on Lou Ming\u2019s shoulders and placed her forehead tightly against his forehead.Lou Ming suddenly felt the world quiet down; there was only the sound of their breathing in his room, his sight was filled with the girl\u2019s bright eyes and her thick and long eyelashes.After Chen Yu stayed like that for about ten-seconds, she straightened up and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to have a fever.\u201dThe lingering touch of her forehead against his had still not completely disappeared, Lou Ming still felt there was something touching his forehead, soft, itchy, and warm, it made him want to reach and touch it.\u201cThird Brother, I know you lost your appetite because you are sick, but you still have to eat so your body can regain strength.\u201d Chen Yu said to Lou Ming with a serious expression on her face.\u201cOkay.\u201d Lou Ming nodded in reply.\u201cThen I\u2019ll call Assistant Cheng to prepare dinner for you, what does Third Brother want to eat?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cWhat should I eat to gain strength?\u201d Lou Ming asked with a smile on his face.\u201cOf course, you have to eat rice, ah.\u201d Chen Yu said immediately without thinking twice.\u201cThen I\u2019ll eat rice.\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cI\u2019ll tell Assistant Cheng to prepare a few light side dishes, people who have a cold can\u2019t eat greasy food.\u201d After she finished speaking, she opened the door and went out.Once Chen Yu left the room, Lou Ming finally complied with his inner desire and lifted up his hand to softly touch his forehead.Contacts between humans should be warm, only if there\u2019s warmth would it be called a valid contact, the rest are a product of social instinct in order to survive. [T/N: I think \u2018contact with warmth\u2019 means contact with feeling, while other human contact is just made to survive (like working, kissing up to your boss, etc.)]Lou Ming once saw such a sentence on the internet, he didn\u2019t quite understand it at that time, but he understood it just now.So, this is contact with warmth?After studying hard for a week, finals finally arrived. The first exam was advanced mathematics; Chen Yu hated math the most, she always felt those complicated formulas were more difficult to understand than the most difficult spells. For this subject, Chen Yu decided to thank the Heavens above and Earth below if she could pass the test, she wouldn\u2019t hope for anything else.Didn\u2019t they say university exams are simple? Does Imperial University want to do something special? Why is it so difficult?!\u00a0Chen Yu was depressingly immersed herself in answering questions.At that time, in a secluded alley two blocks away from Imperial University, a middle-aged man in a suit walked to the entrance, no one was in front of him, \u201cHave you thought about it?\u201dFollowing his words, three ghosts floated out of the wall and looked straight at the middle-aged man.\u201cIt seems that you also know it\u2019s useless to escape.\u201d The middle-aged man glanced at the child and female ghosts next to Xiang Nan and couldn\u2019t help raising his brows.Seeing the middle-aged man, the female ghost was instinctively scared, but she still resisted and asked, \u201cCould you not use the Soul Refining Array? We will sign a contract with you.\u201d\u201cContract?\u201d The middle-aged man shook his head, \u201cIf you guys were so willing like this before I drew this array, then I might consider it, but now\u2026 it\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The female ghost still wanted to argue but was blocked by Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan sent a death glare to the middle-aged man.\u201cIt\u2019s this look, unwillingness, resentment, enmity.\u201d The middle-aged man sneered, \u201cHow can I sign a contract with a ghost who hates me to the bone? Why would I ask for trouble for myself?\u201d\u201cBut the power inside you is really attractive. I\u2019ve been to many places and seen a few refined souls, but a ghost with such a good aptitude like you is really rare. I won\u2019t let good things slip out of my hands, so only by refining your soul can I use you without worry.\u201d The middle-aged man\u2019s eyes fell on Xiang Nan, they were full of greed.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The female ghost wanted to say something in retaliation, but she unconsciously when the middle-aged man glanced towards her.Xiaokang was also a little scared and leaned beside Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan looked at Xiaokang, then raised his head and asked, \u201cDid you do something to Xiaokang?\u201d\u201cOh, you finally figured it out? Did you try sending him to reincarnate? Wasn\u2019t he rejected by the Underworld?\u201d The middle-aged man asked with a smirk.\u201cIt was you!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d the middle-aged man admitted without scruples, \u201cYour power is really strong, if I wanted to just kill you, although it would be troublesome it\u2019s not impossible. However, if I want to refine you, then I must suppress you completely. You\u2019d rather die than submit, how could you obediently be subdued by me? That\u2019s why I used a small, little trick.\u201dXiang Nan was itching to rush and tear the man to pieces.\u201cA ghost isn\u2019t a human after death, even a ghost who died so many years ago. An evil spirit covered in resentment like you actually has something you care about.\u201d The middle-aged man looked at the little ghost next to Xiang Nan mockingly, \u201cJust for this weak little thing, you land yourself in this kind of plight, it simply couldn\u2019t be more foolish, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\u201dXiang Nan clenched his fists tightly under the man\u2019s unbridled laughter, but he couldn\u2019t do anything. Although he was very unwilling, this shameless Celestial Master has already gripped the gate of his vitality. He even had the impudence to make a move against Xiaokang the first chance he got and closed Xiaokang\u2019s chance to reincarnate.The man naturally discovered Xiang Nan\u2019s naked hatred towards him as the resentment that suddenly skyrocketed was the best proof.\u00a0Anger, resentment, grudge, that\u2019s good, the more you hate the stronger your power will be, after I refine your soul, it will become even more powerful, ha, ha, ha, ha\u2026\u201cAre you going to let them go after you refine my soul?\u201d Xiang Nan asked through gritted teeth.\u201cOf course, they\u2019re rubbish to me.\u201d The middle-aged man said with contempt.A murderous intent flashed through Xiang Nan\u2019s eyes.\u201cI know you want to kill me, but it\u2019s useless, you\u00a0can\u2019t\u00a0kill me.\u201d He felt Xiang Nan\u2019s killing intent, \u201cI\u2019m not a good person but I always mean what I say. As long as you obediently let me refine your soul, I won\u2019t harm them but I can also help them transcend, how about that?\u201dXiang Nan gazed at the middle-aged man as he started to ponder the proposal; he was already left with no other choice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Xiang Nan\u2019s eyes were a bloody red, he desperately wanted to throw himself out.With a loud\u00a0bang, four thick, pitch-black chains no less than a baby arm\u2019s width suddenly emerged from the ground, one end tied to the wall and the other end to Xiang Nan\u2019s limbs.The shackles thrashed along with Xiang Nan\u2019s struggles, moving violently with ear-piercing crashing and banging sounds yet he was unable to throw them off even a little.The middle-aged man saw it\u2019s enough and retracted his hand; the blue flames that burned Xiaokang suddenly puffed out. He stopped screaming, but after trembling twice, he lay motionlessly on the ground.\u201cXiaokang! Xiaokang, how do you feel?\u201d the female ghost quickly hugged Xiaokang only to see Xiaokang\u2019s normally ruddy face had turned pale, and the aura on his body was scarily weak; this was the sign that his soul was going to disperse, ah.Xiang Nan had already calmed down a bit, he turned his head and looked at Xiaokang with red eyes and saw his younger brother whom he had carefully taken care of had become like this now; his heart felt so distressed and pained.Forget it, forget it, he had long lost his obsession towards life and death anyway. Isn\u2019t it just refining his soul? What\u2019s the big deal? If he lost his mind, then there would be no Xiang Nan in heaven and earth, only a frenzied evil spirit left behind. Regardless of being reduced to a tool used by people or his soul scattered and disappeared to nothingness, he would then have no consciousness left to even feel anything.He would just assume that from today, his soul had already disappeared.\u201cLet them go!\u201d Xiang Nan said with unusual calmness.\u201cHave you straightened out your mind?\u201d the middle-aged man showed a smile as he felt that he was about to succeed.\u201cRemember your words, transcend them when the soul refining is over.\u201d Xiang Nan said.\u201cOf course!\u201d the middle-aged man agreed straightforwardly.After hearing the conversation between the two, the female ghost cried out anxiously, \u201cNo, Xiang Nan, don\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019ve already died once, I\u2019m not afraid.\u201dXiang Nan turned around, he gazed at the weeping female ghost, then walked towards her with his long slender legs, the pitch-black chains clanged along with the young man\u2019s movements until he stopped before the female ghost.Xiang Nan slowly squatted down, he looked at the hideously crying female ghost and leaned over, kissing her forehead under her surprised eyes.\u201cXiang Nan\u2026\u201d the female ghost was stunned.\u201cLeave here with Xiaokang.\u201d Xiang Nan whispered.The female ghost looked at the young man, remembering the time when the two first met, when she had just died and became a new ghost. She\u2019s someone who loved good-looking young men through and through, because she had never been in love before so she wanted to go to the best university in Imperial City to look at dashing and brilliant young men before she reincarnated. However, Imperial City\u2019s auspicious aura was too strong, and she wasn\u2019t strong enough to get close to it, that\u2019s why she had to squat on the side of the road closest to Imperial University, stealing peeks at those handsome young men coming and going.One day she followed a handsome guy into this alley and was suddenly called by the soft sound of a child, \u201cSister, are you going to harm someone?\u201dThe female perverted ghost was taken aback for a second, and when she came back to her senses, she realized that it was just a little ghost kid, so she couldn\u2019t help but say fiercely, \u201cYou brat talking nonsense, be careful or I\u2019ll hit you.\u201d\u201cWho are you going to hit?\u201dFollowing a cold sounding sound, the female ghost saw the most beautiful person she had ever seen in her life, it turned out there really are people in this world who perfectly fit the portrayal described and praised in songs and poems.From then on, the female perverted ghost began to frequently appear around the alley, trying to peek at the beauty.One day Xiaokang asked her, \u201cSister Weiwei, why don\u2019t you go reincarnate?\u201d\u201cI want to collect 999 handsome men.\u201d\u201cThat much, ah, have you collected all of them yet?\u201d\u201cIf I can\u2019t collect them all, then I\u2019ll come and kiss your brother, I will be satisfied if I can kiss him, ah.\u201dThe female ghost remembered when she finished saying this, she was slapped by an angry Xiang Nan. However, she didn\u2019t expect her wish to be realized today.\u201cGo!\u201d Xiang Nan stood up to make way for the female ghost.She was silent for a moment, then grit her teeth, hugged the motionless Xiaokang, bowed her head, and walked out of the alley. She slowly approached the middle-aged man who was standing at the alley\u2019s entrance step by step.The man naturally sensed her hostility, but he could just pinch such a weak ghost to death with a single finger, so he didn\u2019t mind the other party\u2019s threat to his mind.The female ghost walked step by step, and right at the moment when she passed by the middle-aged man, she suddenly turned violent, her fingernails grew longer and she pierced them towards the man\u2019s heart.\u201cCourting death!\u201d a burst of energy came out from the man, and it struck both the female ghost and Xiaokang.Xiang Nan flew to catch them only to find the female ghost, who once had a somewhat clean aura, already had a pale face with red eyes, all of her body was surrounded by pitch-black resentment.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Xiang Nan wanted to say more but hesitated.\u201cI\u2019m really useless, even if I become an evil spirit, I\u2019m still so useless!\u201d The female ghost\u2019s fragile soul body was already a little unstable after being harmed by the man\u2019s attack.Xiang Nan looked at the two souls in his embrace, both of their bodies were no longer stable. With a gaze full of hate, he stared at the middle-aged man fiercely, \u201cYou said that you won\u2019t hurt them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s her that overestimated her strength, a mantis trying to obstruct a chariot, if it wasn\u2019t because of you, then her soul would already scatter away right now.\u201d The middle-aged man suddenly crouched down and picked up a yellow charm from the ground, something that fell down when the female ghost flew from his attack, \u201cSensor Talisman, you\u2019re quite capable, ah, you actually can find a Celestial Master to help you.\u201dThe middle-aged man unfolded the talisman paper and sneered after he looked at the smooth incantation lines on it, \u201cUnexpectedly, there\u2019s someone who dares to snatch something that I have my sight on, this person is simply tired of living.\u201dHalfway through the exam, Chen Yu finished all the questions that she could possibly answer, while the rest were untouched, and now she planned to calculate her score. If she can get 70 points, then she wants to hand in the exam, after all, there\u2019s still 10 points the teacher will deduct, the passing score shouldn\u2019t be too big. If she can\u2019t get 70 points, then she will persist, she can get a few points for writing a few more steps, right? [T/N: not quite sure with my tl here.\u00a0PR: Chen Yu thinks she will get some points for showing some work even if she doesn\u2019t get the correct answer.]Just when she counted 50 points in, Chen Yu suddenly felt the aura inside her body go out of control; it was expanding and spinning in her dantian like it was about to explode. [dantian: an acupuncture point three inches below the navel, usually believed to be the place where people\u2019s energy gathers inside]BOOM!Chen Yu fell from her seat and coughed desperately on the ground.\u201cClassmate, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Seeing that Chen Yu suddenly fell to the ground, the proctor hurried over to check.Chen Yu raised her head, there was no blood in her face, oh god, the cramp.\u201cClassmate, why is your complexion so bad? Do you want me to send you to the infirmary?\u201d Seeing the color on Chen Yu\u2019s face, the proctor asked in worry.\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m okay!\u201d Chen Yu arranged her breathing, letting the restless spiritual energy in her body calm down before she stood up straight with the help of the teacher. She grabbed the test paper on the table and handed it to the proctor and said, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019m handing in the paper.\u201dChen Yu turned and walked to the podium, took the bag she put there and strode out of the classroom.Who\u2019s brave enough to attack me, your grandaunt! [T/N: grandaunt here is a vulgar way for a woman to refer to herself in a verbal fight]Chen Yu walked out of the classroom angrily, turned towards the stairs, found a corner with no one in sight, flipped her hands, and drew a symbol in the air, \u201cHeaven and earth spirits, descend!\u201dImmediately after Chen Yu\u2019s words fell, a golden charm formed in the air. This was the ultimate pinnacle of spiritual charms, the Spirit Descending Charm. Legend has it that in ancient times when magic was thriving, the Spirit Descending Charm could invite immortals, but now in the age where magic was vanishing, it can only give spirituality / intelligence to the talisman. [T/N: I confess, I\u2019m only guessing with these words here]Chen Yu saw the spell forming, felt the source of power just now in her heart and pointed her finger, \u201cGo!\u201dThe talisman suddenly passed through the wall and flew straight to the alley\u2019s entrance not far away.Chen Yu picked up her bag and was about to chase the talisman when she heard a chuckle from above.Chen Yu raised her head in surprise and saw a handsome young man smiling at her, \u201cClassmate, you still have to study for exams, heaven and earth spirit formulas are useless!\u201dChen Yu didn\u2019t have time to pay attention to him. She smiled awkwardly and ran out with her bag in her hands. The boy saw Chen Yu was embarrassed so he didn\u2019t say anything more, only smiling as he went down the stairs.The school entrance was very close to where Chen Yu took her exam, she ran so fast she attracted the attention of numerous students on the campus.Meanwhile, in an alley near the Imperial University, the middle-aged man had finished giving the talisman\u2019s master a lesson. He looked at Xiang Nan and said, \u201cI\u2019m giving you face so I\u2019ll let her off this time, if there\u2019s another time, then don\u2019t blame me for being impolite.\u201d\u201cXiang Nan, don\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d the female ghost still wanted to stop Xiang Nan.\u201cMy patience is limited.\u201d The man reminded him.Xiang Nan picked up the female ghost and Xiaokang at the same time, walked step by step to the other exit, and pushed them out using strength.\u201cNo, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d the female ghost looked at Xiang Nan with eyes full of tears, but she couldn\u2019t reach him no matter how.\u201cBrother, brother.\u201d Xiaokang also woke up at this time and called Xiang Nan while mumbling.Xiang Nan closed his eyes and abruptly turned around, no longer looking at the two behind him. The hostility in his body kept surging stronger and stronger until the soul-refining array on the wall was fully activated, constantly devouring his hostile energy and drawing out his soul at the same time.This type of soul-refining array continuously absorbs an evil spirit\u2019s hostile energy, after it has absorbed enough energy, it will begin to absorb the evil spirit\u2019s soul body. After the evil spirit becomes extremely weak, the Celestial Master will be able refine it. Originally, these procedures required the Celestial Master to defeat the evil spirit themselves and right when the evil spirit\u2019s soul was about to disperse, he could use a Soul-Refining array.What Xiang Nan was doing was weakening his own energy until his soul was unable to resist, then the man in front of him could walk inside the alley to refine his soul without much effort.The middle-aged man saw Xiang Nan was finally resigned to his fate and he was about to get another powerful ghost-servant, so he couldn\u2019t help but showing a wide smile full of satisfaction.BOOM!Just as the middle-aged man was smiling triumphantly, a golden spell suddenly flew from behind, and a powerful spiritual force exploded on him. The man hadn\u2019t noticed it and he was caught off guard by the impact of the spiritual force, sending him flying inside the alley.Xiang Nan saw the man unexpectedly enter the alley, he changed into a black shadow in the blink of an eye and rushed over as boundless evil energy completely surrounded the man until he had no way of escaping.After the middle-aged man was caught by Xiang Nan, he quickly reacted and took out a mahogany sword from his sleeves to fight Xiang Nan.Xiang Nan was itching to tear him apart, he was frenzied; he kept attacking frantically without thinking about defending himself.The middle-aged man defended himself in a flurry, he needed to find a chance to leave the alley as soon as possible. As long as he can leave the alley, he can grab the little ghost and Xiang Nan wouldn\u2019t dare to mess around no matter how powerful he was.The middle-aged man sacrificed an advanced level talisman to shake Xiang Nan away, and he was finally able to run to the entrance through a gap. However, Chen Yu had arrived right then. In her eyes, there was no monstrous evil energy emitting from Xiang Nan, only the familiar aura coming from the man before her.You bastard, you\u2019re the one who attacked this grandaunt!Chen Yu directly brandished her compass as she raised her hand and threw it forcefully.The poor man hadn\u2019t stood firmly when he was slapped back inside the alley by a huge spiritual energy.Author\u2019s NOTE:Xishi: You actually attacked me while I\u2019m taking my exam, what if I fail my finals?Third Young Master: There\u2019s still me, I\u2019ll tutor you.Xishi: Then I won\u2019t kill him, only hit until half dead\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The hostile energy inside the alley became heavier, completely suppressing the man\u2019s aura. He had no power to fight back, so he could only take out another advanced-level talisman he brought for a high price and once again shook Xiang Nan away from himself.The man took this opportunity to run towards the alley\u2019s entrance again.Chen Yu saw the man running towards her, so she simply lifted her foot and kicked him back in.Like a hungry tiger pouncing on his prey, Xiang Nan immediately rushed to kill.\u201cLittle girl coming from nowhere, what are you making trouble for?!\u201d the middle-aged man shouted at Chen Yu while avoiding Xiang Nan\u2019s attacks. He hadn\u2019t recognized Chen Yu as the Celestial Teacher he just gave a \u2018lesson\u2019 to.\u201cHe, he\u2026\u201dThe middle-aged man fell prey to Chen Yu\u2019s plot time and again, he had already lost the decisive opportunity in this fight. Xiang Nan took a posture of \u2018fighting to one\u2019s last breath\u2019 and the middle-aged man knew that he would be seriously injured if he waited any longer, so he took out the last advanced talisman he had and intended to take this opportunity to escape for good.When the man ran to the alley\u2019s entrance this time, he shouted, \u201cGet out of the way!\u201d\u201cHe, he\u2026\u201d Chen Yu raised her right hand, and the compass that had been floating in the air slowly floated back to Chen Yu\u2019s side.\u201cAre you that Celestial Master?\u201d the middle-aged man felt the aura on Chen Yu\u2019s body and his face changed suddenly.\u201cI studied hard for half a month, but you actually attacked me when I was taking my exam?\u201d Chen Yu showed a hideous grin and waved her right hand forward ruthlessly, and the man was immediately smashed back into the alley by the buzzing compass.Xiang Nan roared and rushed up again.People are divided between good and bad, so of course it was the same with Celestial Masters. Chen Yu was ignorant when she was young, she once asked the old man, how to know if a Celestial Master is good or bad? Chen Yu still remembered the old man\u2019s answer.Back then, Chen Yu had just learned how to draw talismans, the old man pointed to the talisman Chen Yu had just drawn carefully and said, \u201cTalismans are made by the Celestial Master\u2019s own spiritual power, so there\u2019s a close connection between them. For example, this talisman, because you\u2019re the one who drew it, then you can feel if it\u2019s used by someone.\u201d\u201cTalisman is formed by your energy and can help others, but at the same time, others can also use the connection between the talisman and you to harm you through a special spell. Little girl, you have to remember a Celestial Master\u2019s magic should be used to fight supernaturally evil things, such as exorcising ghosts or evil spirits, using magic to harm people is a big taboo in the spiritual world.\u201d The old man said solemnly, \u201cIf one day someone dares to use your talisman and casts a spell to harm you, find them and beat them to death.\u201dChen Yu looked at the half-dead man beaten by Xiang Nan, and suddenly felt that as long as she didn\u2019t let the man out of this alley, then she didn\u2019t need to beat him up herself and this man would still end up in almost the same condition as if she did it herself.The man saw Xiang Nan completely ignored the soul-refining array and used his power frantically, it was obvious he had made up his mind to die alongside him. The opportunities created by the three advanced-level talismans were all ruined by this little girl who suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Left with nothing else, the man made a determined effort and took out a black wooden tablet from his pocket.What was sealed in this wooden tablet was an evil spirit he refined in Xiangxi ten years ago, right now, its strength was nearing that of a ghost king. If it weren\u2019t for the fear that two formidable evil spirits appearing at the same time would bring attention from the spiritual world, he would have already taken this out a long ago. However, at this time, he had no way to care about anything else.\u201cGhost King, heed my command!\u201dFollowing the man\u2019s voice, an evil spirit stronger than Xiang Nan suddenly appeared. Two majestic Yin auras collided, they soared high into the sky and thunder rolled with frightening roars.Xiang Nan was shaken away by the sudden huge Yin aura, he looked up and saw a pitch-dark ghost shadow standing firmly in front of the middle-aged man.Ghost King! It was the first time Chen Yu saw a Ghost King, its dreadful Yin aura made her take a step back.\u201cEat him, you can completely evolve into a Ghost King after eating him.\u201d The man leaned against the wall and pointed at Xiang Nan.Although the Ghost King was powerful and the aura of its whole body was daunting, there\u2019s no trace of emotion in those red eyes left except for indifference. After hearing the man\u2019s order, the Ghost King suddenly jumped up and rushed towards Xiang Nan. The two evil spirits\u2019 fight was too fast for the naked eye to see and Chen Yu couldn\u2019t see anything except for fragmentary reflections.Boom! Boom! Boom!Three booms of thunder sounded in the sky one after another, a warning from Heaven caused by the dense Yin energy. At the same time, Celestial Masters of the spiritual circle of Imperial Capital, no matter what they were doing all stopped immediately to look up at this warning and thought, what kind of evil spirit was born into the world?The man ignored Xiang Nan after he released the Ghost King, because he knew, although Xiang Nan was powerful, he wasn\u2019t yet an opponent for the Ghost King which had evolved from devouring thousands of ghosts.The man raised his hand to wipe at the bruise at the corner of his mouth, and walked towards Chen Yu step by step with a dark face.\u201cGirl, you\u2019re courting death!\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s interference again and again made the man extremely angry, he raised his hand to strangle Chen Yu\u2019s neck with a hideous face.Chen Yu avoided the man\u2019s arm sideways and kicked his face with a round kick. He was kicked to the wall, and before he could react, he was tossed down to the ground by Chen Yu\u2019s shoulder throw.If you have to rank Chen Yu\u2019s talents, she\u2019s third in studying, second in ghost-hunting, and first in fighting.The two spirits were fighting in the alley as Chen Yu held the man to the ground and beat him up wildly outside the alley. She cussed while beating him, \u201cYou attacked me while I was taking an exam, do you know how difficult it is to get high points?\u201dHow would the man know he didn\u2019t only get beaten by Xiang Nan\u2019s hands, but also planted on the ground by a little girl\u2019s hands?\u201cGhost King!\u201d the man yelled.In the alley, Ghost King who was facing Xiang Nan suddenly turned into a puff of black smoke and floated towards Chen Yu.\u201cShit\u2026!\u201d how would Chen Yu know where her fist would land on the Ghost King? She was frightened out of her wits and didn\u2019t know what to do. As she was about to get up and run away when she saw a black wooden tablet out of the corner of her eyes. Chen Yu immediately recognized this wooden tablet as the ghost tablet where the Ghost King resided in, so she stepped on it without thinking.Crack!\u00a0The ghost tablet was broken into two, and the Ghost King who had drifted in front of her suddenly disappeared, and even Yin energy filled black cloud cleared up in an instant.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d the man couldn\u2019t believe what he saw.\u201cHow can such an important thing as a ghost tablet use such a brittle wood?\u201d After Chen Yu finished spitting this out, she continued to raise her foot and kicked the person.This grandaunt, I, only want to beat you up to relieve my anger, but you dare to use a Ghost King to deal with me, this is plain murder, ah.\u201cPolice, don\u2019t move!\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s heart skipped a beat, she stopped her foot that was lifted up in the air.I\u2019m so done! I\u2019m gonna enter the police station again!\u201cSir, are you okay?!\u201d The police helped the bruised man from the ground while secretly saying to himself that it was too miserable.The man stood up and didn\u2019t answer the police, but stared at Chen Yu standing to the side with spiteful eyes.\u201cYou\u2026 Chen Yu?\u201d the police officer couldn\u2019t help exclaiming when he turned around and saw Chen Yu.\u201cSergeant Qiu?!\u201d Chen Yu greeted nervously.\u00a0It\u2019s over, it\u2019s over, 80% of his injuries were inflicted by XiangNan, ah, but ordinary people can\u2019t see ghosts, I\u2019m so in trouble this time!\u201cYou\u2026 you did this?\u201d Qiu Heng asked with a complicated expression on his face.\u201cI\u2026 would you believe what I have to say?\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s awkward laugh was uglier than crying.Qiu Heng hesitated, he looked at the miserably injured man next to him and asked, \u201cIs she the one that caused your injury?\u201dThe man naturally knew the two knew each other, but no matter whether they knew each other or not, he didn\u2019t want to go to the police station. He took a step aside, avoided Qiu Heng\u2019s support, looked at Chen Yu and asked, \u201cYour name is Chen Yu?\u201d\u201cWhat are you gonna do about it?\u201d Chen Yu stared back without showing any weakness.\u201cJust wait and see!\u201d the man said viciously.\u201cSir, we can go to the police station to fix up whatever things we have to do, don\u2019t say these kinds of words that can be misconstrued as you getting revenge.\u201d Qiu Heng noticed the man\u2019s expression and tone were wrong, obviously he wanted to get revenge on Chen Yu later on so he couldn\u2019t help but give a warning.The man turned his head and stared at Qiu Heng. Qiu Heng who looked at him couldn\u2019t help but shudder,\u00a0this man isn\u2019t a good person!\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Chen Yang, who had been waiting in the car for a long time, saw Qiu Heng couldn\u2019t handle this fight, so he walked over with a cold face.When Chen Yang approached, he looked at the man\u2019s injuries and frowned,\u00a0this can be sentenced as criminal assault. The beating seemed to be done by a girl, he wanted to see what kind of valiant, masculine woman she was, so Chen Yang turned his head to see the culprit with some curiosity.\u201cBrother!\u201d Chen Yu greeted him with a crumpled and ugly smile.The Coke can in Chen Yang\u2019s hand fell down on the ground with a clatter, wetting the ground.\u201cWhat is this?!\u201d Chen Yang said angrily.Chen Yu took a step back in fright, pointed to the man with a scarred face and said, \u201cHe bullied me first!\u201dQiu Heng felt like he wanted to cry piteously when he heard this. Little sister Chen Yu, ah, if you want to find an excuse, then find a decent one, if you beat people up like this, how can you still claim you were bullied?\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Chen Yang glanced over the man\u2019s swollen face in shock.Qiu Heng looked at the bag Chen Yu dropped on the ground and asked with a flash of inspiration, \u201cDid he steal your bag?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 he\u2026\u201d\u201cSay he molested you!\u201d didn\u2019t know when the female perverted ghost floated over.\u201cHe molested me!\u201d Chen Yu whose mind was chaotic, naturally accepted the female ghost\u2019s suggestion.\u201cWhat!!!\u201d Qiu Heng looked at the man angrily. In his eyes, that bruised, pitiful face changed into a boorish one in an instant.The man obviously didn\u2019t expect Chen Yu to say something so outlandish, he felt like his blood was choking him in his chest but he couldn\u2019t spit it out.When Chen Yang heard someone actually dared to molest his sister, he abruptly turned his head and stared at the pig-headed man, his chest heaved up and down violently, and it took all of his life\u2019s self-control to resist the urge to go up and beat him up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chen Yang led the way with an ugly face while Chen Yu followed behind with a guilty conscience and Qiu Heng rudely pushed the man inside.Bang!\u00a0Chen Yang slapped his gun on the desk heavily, shocking the other members inside.\u201cBoss, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Someone secretly asked Qiu Heng who brought a detained person in.\u201cThat\u2019s boss\u2019 little sister.\u201d Qiu Heng pointed at Chen Yu with his chin.\u201cThe one who treated us to breakfast last time?\u201d When Chen Yu left Chen Yang\u2019s dormitory last time, she bought more than a dozen breakfasts for the people on the team, so they all remembered her.\u201cEn.\u201d Qiu Heng nodded, then pulled at the middle-aged man forcefully, \u201cThis guy actually dared to molest our boss\u2019 little sister and was caught by me red-handed.\u201d\u201cF*ck, is he so impatient to die?\u201d The hot-blooded policeman was about to raise his hand to give the other party a lesson, but found he was already in a miserable situation, so he quietly put down his hand and asked in a low voice, \u201cDid the boss hit him?\u201d\u201cOur boss is the most upright person ever, how can he beat people up casually? It\u2019s little sis, Chen Yu that beat him up.\u201d QIu Heng whispered.Qiu Heng and the police officer who asked him turned their heads to look at Chen Yu. Chen Yu gave a smile back with a guilty conscience inside.\u201cWorthy of being boss\u2019 little sister!\u201d the police officer silently gave a thumbs up.Qiu Heng nodded in agreement.The victim who heard the whole conversation couldn\u2019t help but roll his eyes.Chen Yang walked out from the back room, his coat was already taken off revealing a military-green T-shirt. He threw a folder on the table and shouted, \u201cWhat are you doing in a daze? Bring the people here.\u201dQiu Heng was taken aback, he hurriedly pulled the person over and pressed him in a chair, \u201cSit!\u201dThe middle-aged man glared at Qiu Heng, as if saying,\u00a0you dare to treat me this way?\u201cWhat are you looking at? Behave yourself!\u201d Qiu Heng raised his hand and slapped the other person on his forehead,\u00a0who asked you to molest little sis Chen Yu?The middle-aged man's eyes were red, but no one cared about him.\u201cShishi, you sit down too!\u201d Chen Yang looked at his sister again, her appearance like she was at a loss of what to do, she must be badly scared.\u201cOh.\u201d Chen Yu sat down very obediently.Chen Yang opened the folder and asked in a deep voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d the man ignored it.\u201cName?\u201d Chen Yang impatiently asked again.\u201c\u2026\u201d the man still ignored it.\u201cHe\u2019s asking you what your name is!\u201d Qiu Heng slapped him again.The man turned his head abruptly and stared at Qiu Heng fiercely. Since he became a Celestial Master, where would there be any ordinary person who didn\u2019t respect him? When would anyone dare to do this to him?!\u201cWhat are you looking at?! He\u2019s asking your name!\u201d Qiu Heng sent his palm flying to him once again.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d As soon as the man\u2019s fingers moved, he felt an undulation of pure spiritual power, so he stopped his movements halfway and turned his head to look at Chen Yu.Chen Yu\u2019s body was surrounded by pure spiritual energy, there\u2019s a warning in her eyes.His ghost tablet was shattered, and the Ghost King couldn\u2019t be summoned temporarily. This girl wasn\u2019t weak, and he may not be able to fight her, the policemen all were her people, it seems he can only admit defeat today.\u201cQi Changming!\u201d The man gritted his teeth and uttered these three words.\u201cWhen and where? Why did you molest my sister?\u201d after Chen Yang finished speaking this, the pen in his hands snapped.\u201c\u2026\u201d Qi Changming felt a mouthful of blood blocking his throat, who is he, who the f*ck molested your little sister?Chen Yu bowed her head with a guilty conscience, inside everyone\u2019s eyes, it looked like the little girl was so sad that she was about to cry.\u201cExplain it honestly!\u201d Qiu Heng, who was filled with righteous indignation, gave him another slap. A wretched middle-aged uncle actually dared to molest a young 18-year-old girl.It was already dark when Chen Yu left the police station, Chen Yang personally drove her back to Imperial University.\u201cBrother, I\u2019ll go first.\u201d Chen Yu unlocked her seat belt and got out of the car.\u201cShishi.\u201d Chen Yang called to Chen Yu, \u201cBe careful when going out in the future.\u201d\u201cBrother, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m very powerful so I won\u2019t suffer.\u201d Chen Yu said.Chen Yang thought about Qi Changming\u2019s tragic injuries and felt like his worries were reduced somewhat.\u201cIsn\u2019t winter vacation coming soon?\u201d Chen Yang asked again.\u201cEn, these two weeks are exam weeks, so we will have a holiday after exams, ah.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cDo your exams well, if there\u2019s no failed tests, then brother will give you a gaming computer.\u201d Chen Yang rubbed Chen Yu\u2019s hair.Chen Yu smiled and nodded, she got out of the car and waited for her brother to leave before jumping on the spot with anger, \u201cQi Changming, ah, if I can\u2019t get this gaming computer, then we\u2019re not done yet!\u201dAfter Chen Yu vented enough, she was about to walk into the school when a pale ghostly face appeared in front of her. She jumped in fright and she almost pulled out a ghost expelling talisman.\u201cCelestial Master Chen, it\u2019s me, it\u2019s me.\u201dChen Yu couldn\u2019t identify her for a while and finally recognized her as that female perverted ghost, \u201cIt\u2019s you ah, why did you suddenly become an evil spirit?\u201d Chen Yu frowned as she looked at the resentment surrounding her.\u201cI thought my power would become stronger if I become an evil spirit.\u201d The female ghost replied with a somewhat desolate expression.\u201cStupid!\u201d Chen Yu was about to scold her when she suddenly thought about the female ghost\u2019s \u2018prompt suggestion\u2019 in the afternoon, so Chen Yu didn\u2019t scold her and asked, \u201cWhy are you looking for me?\u201dUnexpectedly, the female ghost suddenly knelt down which frightened Chen Yu into taking three steps back in shock.\u201cWhat are you doing? Quickly, get up.\u201d Chen Yu shouted.\u201cCelestial Master Chen, please help us.\u201d The female ghost begged.\u201cI already said, I\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m aware we are neither relatives nor friends and me begging you like this is really brazen, but we truly have no other way.\u201d The female ghost pleaded, \u201cAs long as you save us, we absolutely wouldn\u2019t raise any objection in the future whenever you need to use us. Although I know this might seem like an empty promise, we\u2019re all spirits and we honestly have nothing else to offer. Furthermore, there are some \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 antiques that were buried alongside Xiang Nan\u2026\u201dAntiques ?\u00a0Chen Yu\u2019s eyes lit up suddenly, but it dimmed as soon as it came, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help you, but that Qi Changming has a Ghost King on his side, I can\u2019t beat him, ah.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d the female ghost thought for a while and said, \u201cThen, can you let Xiang Nan leave the alley? As long as we leave, that person won\u2019t easily find us.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d\u00a0Alas, I\u2019m still too soft-hearted, Chen Yu thought helplessly.Chen Yu followed the female ghost back to the alley. The hostile energy had disappeared completely. Xiang Nan stood in the alley holding a translucent Xiaokang while looking at Chen Yu silently, not a trace of the haughtiness that was present when they first met can be seen on his face.He bowed slightly towards Chen Yu, \u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t, I\u2019m just here to take a look, I may not succeed.\u201d Chen Yu quickly avoided his bow.\u201cThank you for saving us this afternoon.\u201d Xiang Nan said.Chen Yu was always someone who\u2019s amenable to coaxing but not coercion, so she felt a little embarrassed and tried to change the subject. She looked at the child in his arms and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d\u201cHe was injured by that person, Xiaokang being unable to reincarnate is also his doing.\u201d The female ghost explained from the side.\u201cLet me see.\u201d Chen Yu walked over curiously.Xiang Nan opened his arms to let Chen Yu look at Xiaokang carefully. Chen Yu looked at the little kid for a moment, then stretched out her hand and attached it to the child\u2019s forehead. A soft spiritual force flowed from her fingers and slowly poured into the little boy. After a while, everyone can see the translucent body slowly became solid again.As spiritual power flowed through his body, Chen Yu could see a red pattern on the back of Xiaokang\u2019s hand.\u201cSoul Restriction Seal?\u201d No wonder the Underworld didn\u2019t accept him as spirits who have this seal are spirits who have an owner, and the owner must agree to let them reincarnate.Chen Yu retracted her palm from Xiaokang\u2019s forehead, and stretched out an index finger to point at the seal. Spiritual energy flowed along the lines of the seal, and after about a minute, her spiritual energy gobbled up all the traces of Soul Restriction Seal.\u201cThank you!\u201d Xiang Nan saw that Xiaokang\u2019s soul had solidified and he thanked her again.\u201cAlthough I removed the Soul Restriction Seal on him, his soul body was injured and he still needs to rest for some time, otherwise, even if he goes to the Underworld to reincarnate, he will become sickly in generation after generation.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cXiaokang can reincarnate?\u201d The female ghost was so happily surprised.\u201cYou still have to wait for him to recuperate.\u201d Chen Yu repeated.\u201cIt\u2019s already good, thank you.\u201d Xiang Nan showed a rare happy look, while the female ghost on his side was so happy, she was jumping in joy.Chen Yu wasn\u2019t afraid of people bashing her, but she\u2019s afraid people will keep thanking her. She was unable to adapt to Xiang Nan\u2019s sudden politeness so she quickly changed the subject, \u201cBy the way, why can\u2019t you leave the alley?\u201d [TL: our fish is a little tsun-tsun]Xiang Nan paused for a bit, then he handed Xiaokang to the female ghost before lifting up his hands. A series of rattling noises emerged and four thick chains the width of a child\u2019s arm suddenly appeared under the dim street lamp.\u201cSoul Chain?\u201d Chen Yu exclaimed in surprise; it was the first time she saw such a thick soul chain.\u201cCelestial Master Chen, is there any way to get rid of it?\u201d the female ghost asked anxiously.\u201cNormally, Soul Chains can be split open, but with such a thick chain, I don\u2019t have enough power, ah.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d the female ghost couldn\u2019t hide her disappointment.\u201cIt's okay, now that Xiaokang is safe, I won\u2019t be pushed around by him anymore, it doesn\u2019t matter if I can\u2019t leave here.\u201d On the contrary, Xiang Nan looked even more relieved.Chen Yu pondered for a moment, then she suddenly asked Xiang Nan, \u201cHow long have you been dead?\u201d\u201cAbout six hundred years.\u201d Xiang Nan answered.\u201cHow many antiques were you buried with?\u201d Chen Yu asked again.\u201cNot much, about ten or twenty.\u201d Although Xiang Nan didn\u2019t know why Chen Yu asked this, he still honestly replied.Six hundred years old antiques, ten to twenty pieces, how much money would they be?\u00a0Chen Yu took out her phone, said \u2018wait a bit\u2019 to them and ran to the side to call.\u201cShishi?\u201d Lou Ming put down the pen in his hand.\u201cThird Brother, if there are twenty pieces of six hundred years old antiques, wouldn\u2019t they be quite valuable?\u201d Chen Yu asked excitedly.\u201cYeah, they would be quite valuable.\u201d Lou Ming replied.\u201cThird Brother, I\u2019ll divide the antiques with you 50:50.\u201d Chen Yu said happily, \u201cCould you lend me the bronze sword for a bit?\u201dAuthor\u2019s NOTE:Chen Yang: Didn\u2019t we catch a crime syndicate fighting yesterday?Qiu Heng: Yes.Chen Yang: Then lock that piece of shit together with them.Qiu Heng\u2019s eyes lit up: Understood!TL NOTE:One thing that got my attention, some women misuse their \u2018fragility\u2019 to accuse men of doing things to them and extort money / just being a bully. Sometimes, their accusations could destroy someone\u2019s life, like being jailed, having a criminal record, losing the trust of your family, friends and coworkers, being fired from a job, etc. Although that piece of poo-poo middle-aged man kinda deserved it, I'm still not comfortable with what our fish did to him\u2026 (I understand that it was done under pressure and confusion though\u2026) And, before anyone bash me, Panda is a woman herself, this isn\u2019t me being sexist or anything, okay?

The soul chain naturally can trap an evil spirit with strong spiritual power, but what if the evil energy was stronger?Chen Yu thought about the unmatched evil spirit in Third Brother\u2019s body that was akin to a nuclear power plant and she can\u2019t help but wanted to laugh a few times.\u00a0How come I\u2019m so smart, ah? I\u2019m so talented, ahh~. That bronze sword absorbed so much evil spirit from Third Brother, there must be no problem using it to slash the chains, he, he, he\u2026\u201cThat\u2026 when can you bring it over?\u201d the female ghost anxiously asked.\u201cThe sword is a cultural relic, so I estimate we have to wait \u00a0a few days.\u201d Third Brother just agreed to help her borrow the bronze sword, but because it\u2019s a cultural relic, and it was borrowed by a supernatural circle for research, so it would still take a while to bring it over.\u201cWe still have to wait a few more days, what if that Celestial Master comes again?\u201d the female ghost asked in fear.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, just take Xiaokang to hide for a few days, he can\u2019t deal with me alone here.\u201d Xiang Nan said.\u201cHow could it be okay? There\u2019s a Ghost King beside him.\u201d The female ghost also saw what happened last time, Xiang Nan can deal with Changming easily, but it was obviously not the case with Ghost King. If Qi Changming and Ghost King make a move together, then perhaps Xiang Nan would be fraught with grim possibilities.Xiang Nan naturally understood this, but he was helpless as there\u2019s no other way.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, ah.\u201d Chen Yu suddenly interjected, \u201cQi Changming has been detained, I estimate he will have to stay in the detention center for five or six days. This period of time is enough for me to bring the magical instrument.\u201d\u201cDetained??\u201d the female ghost asked as if she can\u2019t believe what Chen Yu had said, \u201cCould it be\u2026 he was detained because of indecent assault?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d hearing about it, it felt like she was really molested or something, Chen Yu felt an indescribable pain in the @ss.The exam subject tomorrow was English, although Chen Yu\u2019s oral English wasn\u2019t very good, her English entrance exam score was 138 out of a full score of 150. It can\u2019t be said to be super awesome, but for the first year\u2019s exam, it was more than sufficient.As such, after returning to the dormitory, Chen Yu didn\u2019t stay up late to review as she did for the past few days, but checked her phone for the latest tasks on the Supernatural website.Winter vacation was in two weeks and she will have some time every day, she was determined to upgrade her account to A-level before the end of winter vacation, that way, she can receive high level tasks, ah.Didi!Didi!\u2026Chen Yu was looking at the available missions, but her phone\u2019s notifications kept ringing. Don\u2019t know what was wrong with the group God and Ghosts Don\u2019t Ask that it was extremely lively today.Chen Yu clicked open the group news in passing.Cassia Seed: Have you heard? Have you? A zombie appeared in Imperial Capital, and it\u2019s a thousand-year-old zombie, too!Gold Thread Child: Impossible, Imperial Capital is where the dragon veins gather, how could there be a zombie there?Wine and Meat Monk: Right, right, furthermore, the Supernatural HQ is located in Imperial Capital, the three major families are also there, which zombie would think of going to Imperial Capital?Cassia Seed: I heard it just ran out of its grave.Gold Thread Child: Where did you hear that?Cassia Seed: My uncle is in Imperial Capital, he just called my master and said he heard the heavenly thunder warning in the afternoon. Heaven sent thunder, ah, \u00a0a monster must have been born. Are there any friends in Imperial Capital in this group? Come out and confirm this, ah, have you heard about this?Taoist Priest Feng Huo: I heard it, too.March Floating Rain: Me too.Gold Thread Child: Really? A zombie that can alarm the Heaven really emerged in Imperial Capital?Wine and Meat Monk: Amituofu, this poor monk will buy a high-speed rail ticket and come to look.Taoist Priest Feng Huo: When the thunder sounded, my master\u2019s compass detected a very powerful Yin aura, but it quickly disappeared.March Floating Rain: That\u2019s right, my grandfather wanted to calculate the position, but the thunder stopped before he could figure it out and the Yin aura was no longer found.Gold Thread Child: Could this zombie already have intelligence and suppress its own evil spirit and Yin aura and pretend to be an ordinary person living among us?Taoist Priest Feng Huo: You\u2019ve watched too many movies.This afternoon? Thunder from Heaven? Could it be pointing to Xiang Nan and the Ghost King?\u00a0Chen Yu thought for a while and asked in the group: Are you talking about the thunder at about 2:30 in the afternoon?The reason why Chen Yu remembered the time so clearly was because the math exam started at 1 pm. Chen Yu worked on those questions for a little more than an hour, plus by the time she arrived on scene, after estimating the time, the clap of thunder was probably around 2.30.March Floating Rain: Great god, you heard it too?I Want to Fix Road: If it\u2019s truly that time, then not only did I hear it, but I also saw it too.Cassia Seed: Oh f*ck!Gold Thread Child: Awesome!Wine and Meat Monk: You\u2019re actually still alive?Taoist Priest Feng Huo: \u2026March Floating Rain: Great god, were you on the scene? Did you see the zombie?Chen Yu came forward to refute the rumor: It wasn\u2019t a zombie, it was a fight between two evil spirits. The Yin energy was just a bit heavier so it attracted Heaven, that\u2019s all.March Floating Rain: What kind of evil spirits are that awesome?I Want to Fix Road: An evil spirit that had been cultivating for 600 hundred years and a Ghost King.Cassia Seed: F*CK!Gold Thread Child: AWESOME!Wine and Meat Monk: What does the Ghost King look like?I Want to Fix Road: Just like that, it has two more horns than ordinary ghosts.March Floating Rain: Then why did the Yin aura suddenly disappear?Chen Yu pondered for a moment before she typed a line of puzzling words: Because of me.Wasn\u2019t it because of her? If she hadn\u2019t stepped on the ghost plaque with her wittiness, then how could the Ghost King disappear?A row of dots appeared in the group chat instantly, it was obvious that everyone didn\u2019t believe what Chen Yu said.Their thinking was really simple, it was because the Celestial Masters who joined this group were all Celestial Masters who can\u2019t access advanced tasks on the Supernatural website, would a Celestial Master who can clean up a Ghost King still use this group? So the only explanation was that Chen Yu was bragging.Only March Floating Rain talked privately with Chen Yu: Great god, I believe you.Chen Yu smiled, she didn\u2019t care whether the others believed her or not because having money on hand was what matters, ah. Seeing it was late, Chen Yu closed her phone and went to sleep.Three days later, Master Mao took the bronze sword to Lou family\u2019s small courtyard.Master Mao was led by He Qi inside, Lou Ming was already waiting in the living room. The moment Master Mao entered the door, Lou Ming saw the dark wooden box in his hands.\u201cWhy? Do you still feel anything?\u201d Master Mao remembered Lou Ming said he had an inexplicable intimacy with the bronze sword.\u201cEn.\u201d Lou Ming nodded with a complicated expression.Master Mao held the wooden box and walked until he was three steps in front of Lou Ming and said, \u201cHow do you feel now compared with that day?\u201d\u201cEven closer.\u201d Lou Ming smiled bitterly. This feeling of intimacy was too real, as if the sword was once a part of his body, and he couldn\u2019t help but want to touch it. However, if he truly touched it now, the evil spirit in his body\u2026This was the first time he ever felt such desire to get something in his hands.\u201cWhat about the evil spirit in your body?\u201d Master Mao asked.\u201cNo reaction.\u201d Lou Ming shook his head, \u201cIt was the same as last time, although I felt cordiality, the evil spirit inside me doesn\u2019t react before I touch the bronze sword.\u201cIn the supernatural world, if a Celestial Master feels intimacy with a magical tool and the magical tool also gives back the same reaction, it means that the magical tool is alive and has recognized its master.\u201d Master Mao suddenly said.\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d Lou Min raised his eyes in surprise.\u201c80 to 90% possibility, this sword belongs to you.\u201d What Master Mao said wasn\u2019t quite right, at least it\u2019s definitely not the current Lou Ming\u2019s.Lou Ming was stunned before he asked, \u201cHas the archeology study in Nanling yielded results?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d Master Mao shook his head.Lou Ming was in a slight daze; he remembered the two possibilities Master Mao proposed to him that day. If this bronze sword really belonged to him, then\u2026\u201cThen, do you think I was a Celestial Master or a zombie?\u201d Was he a zombie covered with slaughter or a Celestial Master that rid the people of evil?\u201cZombies can\u2019t reincarnate.\u201d Master Mao replied.\u201cThen\u2026 was I a Celestial Master?\u201d Lou Ming was feeling incredulous.\u201cThat\u2019s a very big possibility.\u201d Master Mao looked at Lou Ming\u2019s suddenly bright eyes, however, he felt sad.Although Lou Ming always said he didn\u2019t care so much anymore about why he was born with this evil spirit, Master Mao knew deep down in his heart Lou Ming had always blamed himself as someone with a heinous past life that stopped at nothing to do evil.Now that there's a new speculation, although his evil spirit\u2019s status can\u2019t be changed, at least it can make Lou Ming relax.\u201cI was a Celestial Master?\u201d Just like Master Mao and Chen Yu, a Celestial Master? Thinking of this, Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but feel happy.Master Mao smiled, put the wooden box on the coffee table in the living room, sat down and asked, \u201cThe one who asked you for this sword was little friend Chen, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Chen Yu called and asked him to borrow the bronze sword that day. Lou Ming contacted Master Mao the same night, but he only said he wanted to use it himself, not that he wanted to lend it to others.After all, this bronze sword wasn\u2019t just a cultural relic, but also an ancient spiritual artifact, ordinary people can\u2019t even see it, how could just anybody ask to borrow?\u201cYou, ah\u2026\u201d Master Mao looked at Lou Ming and stopped his words halfway.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Lou Ming asked suspiciously.\u201cNothing.\u201d Master Mao retracted his gaze, only showing a meaningful smile, \u201cI just think you really like little friend Chen.\u201d\u201cOf course, ah.\u201d Thinking of Chen Yu, Lou Ming\u2019s expression softened a lot.Master Mao was shocked when he heard this as his hand that reached for the teacup froze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Didn\u2019t you just say that she wanted to borrow for two hours?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t have bad-hearing, right?Lou Ming explained with a smile, \u201cThis is exam week for Imperial University, Shishi is probably still taking exams, so\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, okay, you can find someone to send it, I\u2019ll just wait a little longer.\u201d Thinking that it was enough consideration, Master Mao then demanded, \u201cBut you have to accompany me to play chess.\u201d\u201cMy pleasure.\u201dHe Qi brought the chessboard, prepared tea and snacks, then picked up the bronze sword\u2019s wooden box, and walked out with it. Waiting at the door was Tian Fei, who volunteered to run errands after hearing Chen Yu was going to exorcise ghosts again.Tian Fei drove to Imperial University with the bronze sword, and waited until Chen Yu came out \u00a0after she finished her exam.\u201cDid you bring the bronze sword?\u201d Chen Yu asked Tian Fei.\u201cHere it is.\u201d Tian Fei turned sideways and let Chen Yu see the wooden box in the passenger seat.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Chen Yu pulled the car door and positioned herself.Xiang Nan\u2019s alley was near Imperial University, it only took a little more than ten minutes by foot to get there, Tian Fei arrived within three minutes by car.Chen Yu got out of the car and walked inside the alley, Tian Fei following closely behind with the wooden box in his arms. He felt inexplicably excited, is the chained ghost who cultivated for 600 years here?\u201cXiang Nan?\u201d Chen Yu raised her hand gently and tapped the wall.Three ghosts floated out of the wall at Chen Yu\u2019s knock.Tian Fei felt a little cold. Although Imperial Capital was quite cold in winter, it was different from the coldness brought about by ghosts. Tian Fei unconsciously clasped the wooden box in his arms and silently moved closer to Chen Yu.Although he\u2019s very curious he can\u2019t help feel afraid as well.\u201cCelestial Master Chen? Did you borrow the magical artifact?\u201d the female ghost asked in joyful surprise.Although Xiang Nan didn\u2019t speak, the excitement in his eyes couldn\u2019t be hidden.\u201cBorrowed. Pull out the Soul Chain and I\u2019ll help you split it apart.\u201d Chen Yu said to Xiang Nan.Split it early and move those antiques early, there happened to be Assistant Chen here with her, so he can help transport things, ah.\u201cYes.\u201d Xiang Nan signaled the female ghost to move Xiaokang away a bit further, then he released the hostility in his body. When the hostile aura reached a certain level, the chain that locked Xiang Nan suddenly appeared in front of Chen Yu.\u201cCan you give me the sword?\u201d\u201cAh!? Oh!\u201d Tian Fei was taken aback. He had known that Chen Yu was a Celestial Master who can see ghosts, but when he saw her speaking to an empty space by herself, how should he describe the feeling? A bit hair-rising, ah.Tian Fei opened the wooden box to reveal the bronze sword inside, then Chen Yu raised her hand to take it.Buzz!\u201cHiss!\u201d Chen Yu felt pain and quickly withdrew her hand. As soon as Chen Yu\u2019s hand touched the bronze sword, the sword that was quietly lying inside suddenly trembled, and the sharp blade pricked Chen Yu\u2019s finger, \u00a0drawing blood. It was thanks to Chen Yu\u2019s quick reaction, otherwise her finger would be lost.Is this sword hostile to me??\u00a0Such an idea suddenly appeared in Chen Yu\u2019s mind.\u201cMiss Chen Yu, are you okay?\u201d Tian Fei asked with a worried look seeing Chen Yu was injured.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I accidentally scratched it.\u201d Chen Yu shook her head, her eyes fell on the bronze sword, hesitating on what to do with it.I can\u2019t touch this sword, so how do I use it to cut the Soul Chain then?\u201cCelestial Master Chen, are you really okay?\u201d Tian Fei only saw that Chen Yu was accidentally scratched by the sword, while Xiang Nan actually saw a fierce, red-blood evil spirit coming from it. This bronze sword clearly didn\u2019t want to be touched by Celestial Master Chen.\u201cIt\u2019s okay!\u201d Chen Yu shook her head again.It was exactly as Chen Yu said, the red-blood evil spirit that lingered on Chen Yu\u2019s scratched fingertip dissipated after a while and didn\u2019t cause her any harm.Since the evil spirit couldn\u2019t hurt its opponent, why would it attack the opponent again? Such a contradiction.\u00a0A bit of uncertainty flashed in Xiang Nan\u2019s mind.Seeing that Chen Yu suddenly stopped and didn\u2019t take the magical weapon, the female ghost stood in a daze, thinking that something was wrong. She wanted to ask, but was stopped by a glance from Xiang Nan.Chen Yu stood there, thinking for a while, and finally looked away from the bronze sword. She turned and walked behind Xiang Nan, raised her hand and grabbed the Soul Chain that locked Xiang Nan\u2019s right hand, before she said to Tian Fei, \u201cAssistant Tian, can you do me a favor?\u201d\u201cMiss Chen Yu, don\u2019t hesitate to tell me what you want.\u201d Tian Fei walked over with the wooden box in his arms.\u201cTake out the bronze sword.\u201d Chen Yu said.Tian Fei took out the bronze sword, then stretched his hand to give it to Chen Yu.Chen Yu looked at the unresponsive bronze sword in Tian Fei\u2019s hand, although she had long guessed the bronze sword might be hostile towards her when it attacked her, but when she confirmed it again with her own eyes, she still couldn't help but feel depressed.\u00a0Why does this bronze sword hate me so much? Is it because I used the compass to deal with it that day?\u201cYou hold it, don\u2019t give it to me.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Although Tian Fei was puzzled, he still did so without any question.Chen Yu put another hand on the Soul Chain and straightened it hard before she turned her head and said, \u201cI have a chain between my two hands, can you feel it?\u201dTian Fei looked carefully but saw nothing, let alone feel anything, so he shook his head silently.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t see it, you just need to know the chain\u2019s position.\u201dThere\u2019s a chain between her hands, it\u2019s not difficult to find its position, Tian Fei nodded in acknowledgement.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you to slash here in a bit, use that bronze sword in your hand to slash the chain.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cOkay.\u201d Tian Fei raised his hand and lifted the bronze sword right above the chain.Tian Fei was no Celestial Master, so he can\u2019t bring the bronze sword\u2019s full power, while Chen Yu can\u2019t even touch it herself. It stood to reason that she should have found another Celestial Master for help, but how could Chen Yu watch the priceless antiques she was about to acquire fall into the hands of others?So, Chen Yu pondered for a while and finally thought of a wonderful idea. If the bronze sword was really hostile to her, it will automatically attack when it senses her aura just like before, then\u2026\u201cSlash!\u201d Chen Yu put her spiritual power inside the Soul Chain.Tian Fei dropped the sword in his hand.Clang!\u00a0Just a light touch, and after a burst of red evil aura, the Soul Chain with the width of a kid\u2019s arm fell to the ground instantly.\u201cSuccess!\u201d Chen Yu exclaimed excitedly, \u201cI know Third Brother\u2019s evil spirit is invincible, ha, ha, ha\u2026\u201dHolding the bronze sword, Tian Fei looked at the ground in a novel way. Although there\u2019s nothing there, the resistance he received when he slashed the sword down let Tian Fei know there must be something there, it\u2019s just that he couldn\u2019t see it.Xiang Nan didn\u2019t expect the chain that had locked him up for six hundred years could really be cut off, his expression was complicated and his heart trembled endlessly.\u201cXiang Nan!\u201d the female ghost ran over excitedly and hugged Xiang Nan.\u201cBrother!\u201d Xiaokang also ran over to join in the fun.\u201cI say, ah, can I get rid of the remaining three Soul Chains first, then you guys bring the antiques to me, before you host a celebration party?\u201d Chen Yu said.The female ghost smiled awkwardly, then walked back to the side with Xiaokang so as not to hinder Chen Yu.Chen Yu and Tian Fei continued to cooperate until they cut the remaining 3 Soul Chains continuously.Finally, the chains that had locked him in place for six hundred years were all cut off. Before Xiang Nan could express the joy of regaining his freedom, he heard Chen Yu suddenly say, \u201cThat\u2026 I have to go back for review because there\u2019s still an exam in the afternoon, so you guys should settle the bill first.\u201dWords of gratitude had just reached his lips but he had to swallow it again. Xiang Nan took a deep look at Chen Yu, then turned and entered the wall.Tian Fei put the bronze sword back into the wooden box, and when he looked up, he almost couldn\u2019t believe what he saw.The alley was obviously empty, however, dozens of antiques, large and small, suddenly appeared out of nowhere in just five minutes.Wh\u2026 where did they come from?\u201cFinished?\u201d Tian Fei heard Chen Yu ask towards the empty space.\u201cIt\u2019s all here.\u201d Ordinary ghosts can\u2019t touch physical things, but it\u2019s different for Xiang Nan. He\u2019s a refined ghost that has been cultivating for six hundred years, if he wanted to, he can even overturn a bus with his bare hands.Xiang Nan\u2019s tomb was right under this alley, its location was extremely deep, so deep that no one found his tomb even though the underground was hollowed out when the government was building Imperial City. If it weren\u2019t for Xiang Nan moving out the antiques one by one, no one would be able to get them.When Chen Yu saw porcelains and jades all over the floor, she instantly grinned joyfully. Turning her head towards Tian Fei she said, \u201cAssistant Tian, these are all 600 years old antiques, see if there\u2019s anything you like, you can pick one.\u201d\u201cAh? For me?\u201d Tian Fei asked in doubt.\u201cYes, ah, if it wasn\u2019t for your help, I wouldn\u2019t be able to cut those chains so smoothly. That\u2019s why, I\u2019ll give you one antique, pick whichever you want, don\u2019t be polite.\u201d Chen Yu said generously.\u201cThis\u2026 is too expensive.\u201d Tian Fei said, lacking in confidence. For antiques that were more than six hundred years old, he estimated that he would never be able to gather that much money working as a soldier for a lifetime.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, la, there\u2019s a lot.\u201d Chen Yu saw that Tian Fei wasn\u2019t picking, so she picked up a blue and white porcelain from the heap and handed it to Tian Fei, \u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll give this to you.\u201dBecause Chen Yu had to go back to school to take her exam, Tian Fei loaded all the antiques into the car and brought them back to the Lou family\u2019s small courtyard.When Tian Fei stood in front of Lou Ming with a bronze sword in his left hand and a blue and white porcelain in right hand, Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help frown looking at his stupid appearance, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThird Young Master.\u201d Tian Fei stammered, \u201cMiss Chen Yu\u2026 said she wanted to give me antiques\u2026\u201dThat money-grubber little girl can actually be so generous?\u00a0Lou Ming was a little surprised but still said, \u201cSince it\u2019s given to you, then you can keep it.\u201d\u201cWhat antiques, let me take a look.\u201d Master Mao, an antique lover, moved closer and took a look at the blue and white porcelain Tian Fei held, \u201cIs it this porcelain vase? Look at this aura, I estimate it has a thousand years old history, blue and white porcelain was scarce back then so it\u2019s worth thirty million at the least, ah.\u201dThirty million?\u00a0Tian Fei\u2019s hands loosened at the sheer shock he received.Fortunately, He Qi that was watching from the side was quick and caught the vase before it fell to the ground, he cursed with cold sweat dripping, \u201cYou dead man, thirty million, ah!\u201dDude, I almost threw away thirty million, I\u2019m so f*cking rich.Author\u2019s NOTE:Tian Fei returned to his dorm with a thirty million porcelain in his hands.It created an unprecedented sensation within the group of assistants and since then, accompanying Chen Yu to exorcise ghosts has become a most sought-after job.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course she must do well on the exam, how can it be okay to just pass?\u201d Mayor Chen disagreed, \u201cThis is the kind of \u2018perfunctory and not striving to make progress\u2019 attitude.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s perfunctory? Isn\u2019t the school requirement just to pass?\u201d Mother Chen retorted.\u201cPassing is the minimum standard, if everyone in society just wants to barely pass, then if they muddle through their work, how can society improve?\u201d Mayor Chen replied back.\u201cIsn\u2019t it just an exam? How can you talk about society\u2019s improvement?\u201d Mother Chen said with displeasure.\u201cI mean, this kind of attitude\u2026\u201dChen Yu saw her parents were quarreling about her exams, so she hurriedly stopped them, \u201cDad, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll try my best on exams. Mom, you can rest assured too, I was number one in my high school. Well, it\u2019s just a test, it\u2019s not that tiring.\u201d\u201cI knew my daughter was so smart.\u201d Mother Chen happily picked up another bit of food for her daughter.\u201cTake the test seriously.\u201d Mayor Chen also encouraged.Chen Yu nodded with a smile on the surface, but she was actually feeling gloomy inside,\u00a0let\u2019s not be hung up on math!After focusing on his daughter, Mayor Chen began to focus on his son, he called out, \u201cChen Yang.\u201d\u201cDad.\u201d Chen Yang turned his head.\u201cDid you arrest a person named Qi Changming the other day?\u201d Mayor Chen raised this topic all of a sudden.Qi Changming?\u00a0Chen Yu\u2019s hand stopped as she raised her head and looked towards her brother.Chen Yang was also looking at her, but he quickly turned his head to his father and replied, \u201cDad, do you know him?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201d Mayor Chen shook his head, \u201cIt\u2019s just that someone called me the other day to plead on his behalf, saying the other party had offended you.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t offend me, and I won\u2019t arrest people just because they offended me, I was just following the rules.\u201d Chen Yang answered,\u201cThat\u2019s good, the police are a disciplined force, you must be cautious and don\u2019t fall for gossip when handling things.\u201d Mayor Chen naturally didn\u2019t agree to the other party\u2019s plea, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t wait so long to ask Chen Yang. He suddenly recalled this matter so he inquired about it to his son in passing.\u201cI know.\u201d Chen Yang nodded.Chen Yu was greatly relieved her elder brother didn\u2019t mention she was \u2018molested\u2019. Her heart felt like it was touching her throat. If her parents who felt like they owed her for her childhood knew their daughter had been molested, then they would definitely make a fuss.Except for this incident, dinner went on quite comfortably. Chen Yu stayed downstairs to accompany Mother Chen in watching TV for a while before she went up to her room.Chen Yu took a shower and was blowing her hair dry when she heard a knock on the door. Chen Yu hesitated, found a towel to wrap her hair up, and then went to open the door.\u201cBrother.\u201d Chen Yu looked with some surprise at Chen Yang who was standing at her door.\u201cMay I come in?\u201d Chen Yang asked.\u201cAh? O-of course.\u201d Chen Yu quickly gave way aside.Chen Yang entered the room and closed the door behind him.\u201cBrother, sit down.\u201d This was the first time Chen Yang had entered her room, Chen Yu was a little flustered and didn\u2019t know what to do, she remembered to drag out a wooden chair by the desk to \u00a0let Chen Yang sit.Chen Yang naturally realized Chen Yu felt panic and discomfort. His own personality was rather dull, so he didn\u2019t know how to express his care to this little sister who was lost for a long time and was finally found with much difficulty.When Chen Yu first came home, she was very optimistic and well-behaved, but they still noticed the estranged and distant feeling her eyes occasionally revealed. The Chen family discussed this in private and decided to not be too obvious and enthusiastic when interacting with Chen Yu, to let her integrate into the family slowly and naturally.This method was very successful, except for his mother, neither he nor his father had much communication with Chen Yu, but Chen Yu quickly settled in.It was precisely because he didn\u2019t interact frequently with Chen Yu that she seemed surprised and uneasy at his sudden appearance. However, Chen Yang still had some things he wanted to ask her.\u201cQi Changming, he will be released tomorrow morning.\u201d Chen Yang blurted.\u201cAh, oh.\u201d Chen Yu sat on the edge of the bed, nodding her head to show she knew.\u201cI checked his identity.\u201d Chen Yang would naturally investigate those who \u2018molested\u2019 his little sister, however after some checking, he felt it was impossible for the other party to \u2018harass\u2019 Chen Yu according to his status, \u201cHe\u2019s a Feng Shui master.\u201d\u201cIs\u2026 is he?\u201d Chen Yu said with a guilty conscience.\u201cThe day after he was detained, at least five different people from various backgrounds called the police station to pressure us to let him out.\u201d If it weren\u2019t for Chen Yang\u2019s identity, it would be impossible to keep Qi Changming in detention until now.\u201cPressure?\u201d Chen Yu paused before she asked anxiously, as if she thought of something, \u201cAre they making things difficult for brother?\u201dChen Yang didn\u2019t expect that Chen Yu\u2019s first reaction would be to care about him, his expression softened a lot as he comforted her, \u201cNo, people in our family are not easy to bully.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Chen Yu was relieved immediately.Seeing Chen Yu\u2019s appearance, Chen Yang was even more sure of his guess, he directly asked her, \u201cQi Changming didn\u2019t harass you at all, did he?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s guilty expression had betrayed her so Chen Yang no longer needed her answer.\u201cCan you tell me what happened?\u201d Chen Yang looked at his little sister, he wanted to know the truth, which was why he went back home on purpose tonight.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Chen Yu could feel her brother\u2019s concern for her, but what should she say about this kind of thing, ah? Could she say Qi Changming suddenly attacked her when she was in the middle of taking her exam? And then because she was so angry she ran to Qi Changming to settle their account, and she happened to see the other party fighting with a ghost? And following that, she turned to helping the evil spirit, taking the opportunity to manipulate a few times?Didn\u2019t this sound even more outrageous than her lies?Besides, what kind of person would help an evil spirit? Even when she heard it, she sounded like she wasn\u2019t a good person,\u00a0sob, sob\u2026Chen Yang saw his sister\u2019s eyes dart around rapidly with a tense expression. After hesitating for a long time and her face turned red, she still didn\u2019t say a peep, so he suddenly felt a little weak.She\u2019s not speaking, it seems that she still doesn\u2019t trust me.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Chen Yang wanted to know the truth, but he didn\u2019t want to make things difficult for Chen Yu.\u201cIt\u2019s okay?\u201d Chen Yu somewhat couldn\u2019t believe what Chen Yang said.\u201cThen, will you tell me the truth?\u201d Chen Yang asked.Chen Yu\u2019s expression became complicated and she fell silent, however she cried out in her heart,\u00a0it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to tell you, but I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll think I\u2019m talking nonsense.As expected\u2026\u201cYou not saying anything about it is okay, but you have to answer a few questions for me.\u201d Chen Yang said.\u201cWhat questions?\u201d Chen Yu raised her head to look at him.\u201cQi Changming\u2026\u201d Chen Yang stared closely at Chen Yu\u2019s eyes, \u201cWho started the issue between the two of you?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s him! I didn\u2019t even know who he was. If he hadn\u2019t provoked me first, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered with him because I was busy studying and taking exams.\u201d Thinking about her math exam, Chen Yu still felt angry.\u201cThen you\u2026 were you hurt?\u201d Chen Yang was afraid Chen Yu had suffered a loss but wouldn\u2019t want her family to know.\u201cNo.\u201d Chen Yu shook her head.\u201cOkay, I get it.\u201d Chen Yang got the answer he needed and got up from the chair, \u201cGet some rest.\u201d\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Chen Yu felt somewhat dumbfounded as she called Chen Yang, she asked under his puzzled gaze, \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019re asking me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough for me.\u201d Chen Yang said, \u201cI needed to make sure you weren\u2019t hurt and that you didn\u2019t start the fight. As long as you didn\u2019t start it, then big brother didn\u2019t catch the wrong person.\u201dAs an older brother, no matter what Chen Yu encountered, even if she was the one in the wrong, he would still protect her. However, as a policeman, Chen Yang can\u2019t abuse his power, so he needed to know who initiated the matter first. As long as it wasn\u2019t Chen Yu, he wouldn\u2019t be regarded as catching the wrong person. As for the specific reason, Qi Changming himself didn\u2019t explain anything, which showed that this matter might be more serious than a case of \u2018molestation\u2019.\u201cGet some rest!\u201d Chen Yang smiled, he then opened the door and left.Chen Yu stood there in a daze, she felt there\u2019s something wrong with her as her chest somewhat swelled up and ached a little, what\u2019s wrong with me?Twelve o-clock, midnight.As usual, Chen Yu waited until the light in her brother\u2019s room had been turned off and confirmed he had gone to sleep before she jumped out the window.When Chen Yu arrived at the Lou's courtyard, Lou Ming was waiting in the living room. On the table there were heaps of antiques Tian Fei had brought back today.\u201cThird Brother, why did you put everything in here?\u201d During the day, Chen Yu was too anxious to go back and catch up with the next exam, so Chen Yu didn\u2019t have the time to appreciate her loot.\u201cBecause I know you would want to look at them.\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but smile when he saw Chen Yu rushing to the table of antiques as soon as she entered the door.\u201cHe, he\u2026\u201d Chen Yu foolishly laughed twice, and said while looking at those priceless antiques, \u201cI didn\u2019t look carefully earlier. It seems that most of them are jade, ah, I don\u2019t know how much they are worth.\u201dLou Ming\u2019s slight smile suddenly turned strange.\u201cBut they\u2019re more than six hundred years old, even if they weren\u2019t worth anything back then, they must be worth a lot now.\u201d Chen Yu said confidently.Lou Ming\u2019s expression became even more strange.\u201cThird Brother.\u201d Chen Yu picked up a jade pendant with a coiling dragon and crouching tiger carved on it and looked at it under the light, \u201cThis jade pendant is very pretty.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d The jade pendant was exquisitely carved and has a transparent color, it was indeed very beautiful.\u201cThird Brother, do you know anyone who collects antiques? Let\u2019s sell all of them and split the money in half.\u201d Chen Yu said after thinking about it, \u201cI heard prices can be higher in an auction, maybe we can go to one?\u201dLou Ming met Chen Yu\u2019s money-greedy shining eyes, he hesitated and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t?\u201d Chen Yu thought Lou Ming also didn\u2019t have a way to get into an auction, so she pondered again, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if we can\u2019t auction them, with so many antiques, we can sell them in an antique market, it\u2019s okay we make less money. He, he, I heard antiques are really valuable.\u201d\u201cShishi, ah.\u201d Lou Ming felt that it was better to tell her the truth before Chen Yu got too excited.\u201cEn?\u201d Chen Yu put down the jade pendant and picked up a colorful porcelain vase.\u201cThese antiques aren\u2019t very valuable.\u201d Lou Ming finally said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I watched the Treasure Appreciation TV program, those black jars were worth a few million easily, how can my authentic six hundred years old antiques be worthless?\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t believe it at all.\u201cDon\u2019t be upset, first let\u2019s sit down, okay? I\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d Lou Ming said.Chen Yu walked hesitantly with the colorful vase in her hands and sat down opposite Lou Ming.\u201cMost of the antiques you found were jade, only three were porcelain, and you gave Tian Fei the blue and white porcelain vase, right?\u201dChen Yu nodded without understanding.\u201cWhen the antiques arrived in the afternoon, Master Mao happened to be here. He\u2019s an expert in this area, so he estimated the prices.\u201d Lou Ming explained using his gentlest voice, \u201cMaster Mao said these jade articles are all good jade, but\u2026\u201d\u201cBut what?\u201d Chen Yu asked anxiously.\u201cBut the aura in them is gone. If jade has lost its aura, then it becomes a dead jade, and dead jade isn\u2019t worth much.\u201d Lou Ming carefully observed Chen Yu\u2019s expression.Chen Yu looked at the dozen exquisite jade antiques on the table in a daze, there really was no aura in them, but can ordinary people see aura anyway?\u201cAren\u2019t ordinary people unable to see aura? Don\u2019t antiques just need to be old?\u201d Chen Yu directly asked the doubts in her mind.Lou Ming shook his head.\u201cThat\u2026 that\u2026\u201d Chen Yu asked desperately, \u201cThey\u2019re really not worth much?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d Lou Ming said, \u201cMaster Mao said although these jade pieces are already dead, they\u2019re suitable for making amulets.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to make amulets, ah, all the spells I learned are for exorcising ghosts, even a Peace Amulet, the effect I draw isn\u2019t as strong as other Celestial Masters, I still won\u2019t be able to do it even if my cultivation increases, ah.\u201d Chen Yu said grievously.Because of the particularity of her own spells, Chen Yu couldn\u2019t use these jade pieces, and now they are worthless?Noticing Chen Yu was about to cry, Lou Ming comforted her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll ask Master Mao if he might want them since he said they are suitable for amulets.\u201d\u201cMaster Mao might want them?\u201d Chen Yu asked with her lips pouting, those puppy eyes looked really pitiful.\u201cOf course!\u201d Lou Ming consoled her again, \u201cHe looked like he really wanted them this afternoon, but I said I have to ask you before he could have them.\u201dThird Young Master Lou, who was always strictly logical, didn\u2019t realize what he said was inconsistent.\u201cThen, sell them to him, get as much money as we can get.\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s mood recovered a little and Lou Ming finally breathed a sigh of relief.\u00a0My gosh, why am I so nervous?Chen Yu felt better, she touched the porcelain vase in her arms and asked, \u201cWhat about the porcelain vases? Are they worthless too?\u201d\u201cThe quality of this porcelain vase isn\u2019t high, although it's old, it isn\u2019t worth much, maybe around two or three million.\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cHow much?\u201d Chen Yu stood up so suddenly.\u201cAbout three million?\u201d Lou Ming removed the \u2018two million\u2019 part.\u201cOne for three million?\u201d Chen Yu asked to confirm it once again.\u201cEn.\u201d Lou Ming nodded.\u201cOne is three million, so two is six million, Assistant Tian has another one, plus the jade articles, they are all worth more than nine million.\u201d Chen Yu was very happy after she finished calculating the money she can earn, \u201cIt\u2019s not a loss, ah, nine million ah.\u201d\u201cThe one you gave Tian Fei is a blue and white porcelain.\u201d Lou Ming reminded her with a complicated expression.\u201cBlue and white porcelain? What\u2019s wrong with blue and white porcelain?\u201d Chen Yu recalled a bit, of the three porcelains the other two were colored and only the blue one was plain. Chen Yu felt Tian Fei wouldn\u2019t like brightly colored things, so she handed over the blue and white one to him.Lou Ming knew from Chen Yu\u2019s expression that she definitely didn\u2019t know what blue and white porcelain was. He couldn\u2019t explain it clearly but he still explained with a heavy heart, \u201cBlue and white porcelain is the most valuable porcelain.\u201d\u201cMore valuable than these two?\u201d Chen Yu finally understood.\u201cEn.\u201d Lou Ming nodded.\u201cHow much is it worth? Four million? Five million?\u201d Chen Yu asked curiously.Lou Ming slowly stretched out three fingers, \u201cThirty million!\u201dChen Yu blinked and blinked, then blinked and blinked again, and after she did this many times, she choked out, \u201cThirty million?\u201dLou Ming nodded and paid close attention to Chen Yu\u2019s reaction.\u201cOne vase is worth ten of these vases?\u201d Chen Yu tremblingly pointed to the colorful porcelain vase in her arms.Lou Ming cautiously nodded.Chen Yu bowed her head in deep thought for a while, then she walked back to the table and put the porcelain vase on the table. Then she looked at all the antiques in silence for a long time before her legs suddenly gave out.\u201cShishi.\u201d Lou Ming was startled. He hurriedly ran to pick her up from the ground.\u201cThird Brother\u2026\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s face looked like she had nothing left to live for, \u201cTell Assistant Tian not to appear in front of me for the time being, or else I can\u2019t bear it anymore\u2026\u201dPfft\u2026Lou Ming couldn\u2019t bear it any more. His body shook from trying to hold in his laughter while he was holding Chen Yu.How come this little girl is so cute, ah. She obviously loves money so much, and knowing she handed 30 million to someone, she didn\u2019t think about how to get it back, but only told the other person not to show up in front of her.\u201cAlright, don\u2019t feel so sad, I don\u2019t want my half portion, I\u2019ll give it all to you.\u201d Lou Ming smiled and consoled her.\u201cThird Brother, you\u2019re still the best to me.\u201d Chen Yu hugged Lou Ming\u2019s waist sadly. She felt like she was about to die from heartache.Thirty million, so much money, sob, sob, sob\u2026The next day, Qi Changming finally walked out of the police station with a still badly swollen face after being detained for three days.\u201cMaster Qi.\u201d A big man in a black suit had been waiting for Qi Changming at the station entrance by a car. When Qi Changming came out, he ran to open the car door.Qi Changming got into the car and looked through the window at the police station, a gruesome and horrible expression was on his face. These three days was the most shameful of his life. Qi Changming gritted his teeth with hate whenever he recalled Chen Yu\u2019s face.\u201cMaster Qi, let me take you to eat something.\u201d The burly man who picked him up said as he started the car.\u201cNo, take me to the suburban villa.\u201d Qi Changming said.\u201cYes.\u201d The big man started the car obediently and drove all the way to the outskirts of the city.An hour later, the car stopped at the entrance of a villa in a gated compound, then Qi Changming got out of the car.The big fellow took a document from the passenger seat and handed it to Qi Changming and said, \u201cMaster Qi, the boss asked me to give this to you. He said the other party\u2019s identity is special, so please consider carefully before making a final decision.\u201dQi Changming took the documents, ignored the burly man, turned around, and walked into the villa.Qi Changming went straight to the basement. The underground space was arranged into a huge altar. On the floor of the altar was a large Supreme Ultimate Yin-Yang Eight Trigrams pattern, surrounded by yellow flags and talismans, and in the middle of the altar was an enshrined broken bone.It was a human rib, surrounded by a gruesome and terrifying aura. Qi Changming walked over and placed the two pieces of the shattered wooden plaque next to the bone.The wooden ghost tablet was nothing more than a medium for summoning the Ghost King as the real dwelling was the human bone that was emitting a ghastly aura. As long as the human bone existed, no matter how many times the ghost tablet was broken, the Ghost King would be fine.With a gloomy expression, Qi Changming opened the file he had been holding and took out the pages inside.\u201cDaughter of the Imperial City mayor, no wonder you can detain me.\u201d Qi Changming sneered, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal with a mayor\u2019s daughter? You still can\u2019t live if I want to kill you.\u201dQi Changming dropped the papers in his hands, scattering them on the ground. He said to the human bone on the altar, \u201cGhost King, you haven\u2019t eaten for quite a long time, you must be hungry. Wait till night comes and you can eat your fill. The soul of a Celestial Master is much more delicious than ordinary evil spirits.\u201dThe Ghost King seemed to understand what Qi Changming said as the Yin aura surrounding the bone suddenly became much richer. The bone shook lightly as if impatient, making clicking sounds on the altar.\u201cYou\u2019re really hungry, ah, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t restrict you tonight, you can eat all you want.\u201d Qi Changming stroked the human bone for a while.A cold and evil wind blew, making the yellow flags around the altar flutter eerily.Author\u2019s NOTE:Master Mao: I didn\u2019t say that I want to buy them, ah.Third Young Master: Will you buy them or not? (Tian Fei picked up the blue and white porcelain and made a throwing gesture).Master Mao: I\u2019ll buy! (Rascals! Such a good blue and white porcelain is rare, ah!)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as she stepped into his house, she would think of Assistant Tian, whenever she thought of Assistant Tian, she would think of the blue and white porcelain, and whenever she thought of the blue and white porcelain, she would think of the thirty million.Thirty million, aaaah!!!Chen Yu was heart-broken and didn\u2019t sleep well at night.\u201cGo to sleep if you\u2019re sleepy.\u201d Mother Chen couldn\u2019t help saying when she saw her daughter sitting on the sofa and yawning.\u201cAlthough Daddy wants you to get good grades on your exams, you shouldn\u2019t study until so late.\u201d Mayor Chen obviously misunderstood that his daughter stayed up late to study because of what he said during dinner yesterday.\u201cNo, no, the exams aren't that difficult, I didn't study last night.\u201d Chen Yu explained, \u201cI just didn\u2019t sleep well.\u201dHearing Chen Yu say she didn\u2019t sleep well last night, Chen Yang who was sitting to the side looking at his phone suddenly raised his head. He glanced at Chen Yu\u2019s tired face, frowned, and began to blame himself.Could it be what I said yesterday was too stressful?\u201cGo to bed if you didn\u2019t sleep well.\u201d Mother Chen said.\u201cI just finished eating, can\u2019t go to bed yet, ah. I\u2019ll watch some TV and go to bed at 8.30.\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s easy to gain weight if you sleep right after eating, and it\u2019s also not good for your stomach.\u201d Mother Chen thought about it and didn\u2019t force Chen Yu to go to bed anymore.A tourist ad was being shown on TV. It was for a resort island located in a subtropical region. The white sandy beach and blue sparkling water looked clean and beautiful.Mother Chen\u2019s eyes lit up, she turned and asked Chen Yu, \u201cShishi, have you been to the beach?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Chen Yu shook her head.\u201cThen, after your exams are finished, how about Mother take you on a vacation?\u201d Mother Chen pointed to the TV and said, \u201cWhat do you think of this place?\u201dChen Yu turned to look at the TV, she was also attracted by the bright and clean sea shown on it, but then she thought that she should use her winter vacation to upgrade her Supernatural website account to level A, so she shook her head at the end and said, \u201cNot going.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Mother Chen was a little lost.Chen family\u2019s father and son were also a little surprised. Has Shishi still not integrated into the family that she wouldn\u2019t even go on vacation with them?\u201cMy spoken English isn\u2019t good, wait until I can speak properly, then can we go?\u201d Chen Yu made an excuse.\u201cYes, yes, Mother will accompany you whenever you want to go.\u201d Mother Chen heard Chen Yu\u2019s reason and immediately agreed.After hearing this reason, Chen family\u2019s father and son\u2019s expressions also relaxed. It turned out she was afraid her spoken English wasn\u2019t good enough, although Shishi never said it, her self-esteem has always been strong.Therefore, the topic of going on a trip was left behind. Chen Yang continued to text, Mayor Chen continued to watch the news on his tablet, and Mother Chen and Chen Yu sat on the sofa to watch TV together. Although everyone did different things, the atmosphere in the living room was exceptionally harmonious.Completely different from this harmonious atmosphere was Qi Changming. He wore a Taoist robe and sat cross-legged in the middle of the Yin Yang diagram.No wind could reach inside the airtight basement, but the dim candle light was flickering continuously while yellow flags fluttered to and fro.A bright white human bone on the altar in front of Qi Changming exuded a powerful Yin aura, it began to tremble as he chanted a spell.It only moved slightly at first, but then it began to shake until the whole altar rocked from its vibrations.The \u2018ka-ka-ka\u2019 sound of the bones hitting the altar in the ghastly and frightening basement leaked outside.\u201cRise!\u201d Qi Changming who was sitting at the ground suddenly shouted, his eyes widened with killing intent, both of his hands clasped together forming a pattern while pointing to the white bone on the altar.Wooo\u2026An overwhelming Yin aura seeped out of the white bone and slowly condensed into a black whirlpool. It transformed into a human figure with ox horns, the Ghost King\u2019s blood-red eyes were staring indifferently ahead.\u201cGo kill her, then swallow her soul so she will forever be unable to reincarnate.\u201d Qi Changming ordered.Following his words, the Ghost King turned into a black mist that moved through the basement wall to seep into the air. The black mist covered the bright crescent moon before it flew towards the center of Imperial City at a speed no human could imagine.Chen Yu was eating potato chips while she watched TV, she didn\u2019t realize something was wrong until the Ghost King reached the compound.What a quick speed!Feeling the murderous intent, Chen Yu hardly had time to think. The only thing she could do was leave the house immediately before the Ghost King arrived to prevent innocent people from getting hurt.\u201cI need to go out for a bit.\u201d Regardless of whether the others heard her clearly or not, Chen Yu immediately stood up and ran out.This murderous aura was approaching so fast she didn\u2019t even have time to go upstairs to get her tools.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Chen Yu had already opened the door before Mother Chen could react.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Mayor Chen raised his head and looked in confusion.\u201cI don\u2019t know, she said she needed to go out suddenly.\u201d Mother Chen said with a worried look, \u201cThis child, she didn\u2019t even wear a coat and ran out like that. It\u2019s so cold outside, ah.\u201d\u201cChen Yang, go out and look for your sister.\u201d Mayor Chen told his son to go out to follow Chen Yu.Chen Yang had already stood up when Chen Yu ran out, he felt Chen Yu\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t right. He nodded to his parents, went to the hallway, grabbed his sister\u2019s down jacket, and chased after her.However, by the time Chen Yang walked out to the gate, Chen Yu was no longer there.Chen Yang frowned and looked around the entrance, perhaps it was his intuition as a policeman that he successfully followed in the direction where Chen Yu was headed.\u201cAh!\u201d There was a sudden cry of pain.\u201cShishi?\u201d The short cry of pain made Chen Yang\u2019s heart beat faster, he knew this voice was his sister\u2019s, he had been trained in the police academy so he couldn\u2019t have made a mistake.Chen Yang\u2019s eyes sank, and he ran forward with big strides. The more he ran, the more frightened he became. If he followed this direction, he would arrive at the Lou Third Young Master\u2019s small courtyard, did Shishi anger his guard?The more Chen Yang thought about it, the more worried he became, and his movements became faster and faster until he finally saw Chen Yu was running as fast as she could.He wanted to call her to stop, but before he had the time to shout, he saw a scene that made him distraught.He saw Chen Yu running in front of him, and as if she collided with a high-speed vehicle, her entire body rose from the ground, and she was thrown over a really long distance into a wall.\u201cAH!\u201d Chen Yu adjusted her posture in the air, letting her back hit the wall, but the huge momentum still made her shout in pain.\u201cShishi!\u201d Chen Yang felt that all the blood in his body was about to freeze. He dropped the jacket he was holding and quickly ran in Chen Yu\u2019s direction.\u201cDon\u2019t come near!\u201d Chen Yu heard Chen Yang\u2019s voice calling out to her, she didn\u2019t know when her brother followed her, but now her face became even more ugly.The Ghost King didn\u2019t give Chen Yu a chance to take a breath at all. Before Chen Yu got up from the ground, he already walked over to punch her again.\u201cRise!\u201d Chen Yu pointed her right hand towards the sky, and a high-speed spinning compass suddenly flew from behind the Ghost King. It slammed into the Ghost King\u2019s waving fist that was about to punch Chen Yu.The Ghost King felt pain, he turned around to catch the compass that had attacked him.Is that\u2026 the compass Old Wu gave to Shishi?\u00a0Seeing the compass suddenly appear, Chen Yang recognized it at a glance. It was given to Shishi by the old man that adopted her. Shishi liked it very much, so she took it with her every time she went to school, almost as if they were inseparable.But, why does an ordinary compass fly in the air? And Shishi, what is she fighting with?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With its help, Chen Yu finally had a chance to breathe.However, she only has the compass, she didn\u2019t have any talismans with her, so Chen Yu was still struggling to fight.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that thing, go and kill the Celestial Master.\u201d Qi Changming ordered.The Ghost King roared, then obediently attacked Chen Yu again. Chen Yu\u2019s expression changed; she immediately ran forward.Chen Yang saw Chen Yu rushing forward so he hurriedly followed behind her. He didn\u2019t care that the place Chen Yu was running towards was a restricted area, he just wanted her to be safe.\u201cAaah!\u201dThey ran straight to the small garden behind the courtyard.The Ghost King threw a handful of evil energy. Chen Yu was rolled up by the energy, her whole person flew upside down and collided against a rockery. Chen Yu rolled away from the spot and the Ghost King\u2019s next punch directly hit the rockery. That two-meter-high fake rockery broke in an instant, its rubble rolled to the ground.Chen Yang looked at the scene in disbelief.Shishi is being chased by something invisible, and the invisible thing can smash a rockery in an instant? What\u2019s that invisible thing? What exactly is it?Chen Yang\u2019s eyes reddened when he saw his sister in danger, but he couldn\u2019t do anything. He tried to get closer to help, but when he took a step closer, the invisible Yin aura that felt like a freezing barrier made him unable to move.\u201cShishi!\u201d Chen Yang\u2019s voice became hoarse, he tried to run forward strenuously, trying to get to Chen Yu, but he couldn\u2019t break through that invisible barrier.Chen Yang didn\u2019t know what to do. A feeling of dread and despair swept through his whole body. What to do? What can I do? How can I deal with this invisible thing?\u201cSpirit incantation, Expelling Talisman!\u201d Chen Yu finally finished drawing a talisman with much difficulty, and she immediately jumped and pasted it on the Ghost King\u2019s head.\u201cRoar!\u201d The Ghost King was in pain, his attacking movements became even fiercer. Chen Yu couldn\u2019t avoid being hit on her forehead by a flying stone and she yelped out in pain.\u201cShishi!\u201d Chen Yang reached both of his hands towards the invisible evil aura that had condensed into a fast-spinning cyclone. He was unable to open his eyes due to the rapid wind and the frost-biting temperature made his hands red, but Chen Yang didn\u2019t retreat, instead he gritted his teeth to squeeze half a foot in.\u201cQuick! Paste them!\u201dHe Qi brought over a dozen people from assistants and the guard regiment, each of them had a talisman in their hands, running towards Chen Yu\u2019s direction.Boom! Boom! Boom!More than a dozen talismans burned and the blood-red evil spirit ripped a small tear in the air.\u201cROAAARRR!\u201d The Ghost King roared, he opened his hands and a huge Yin aura emanated from them. Following the Ghost King\u2019s movement, even the dozen special forces including Chen Yang were overturned.\u201cAgain!\u201d He Qi rolled and stood up, beckoning the others to send another attack.\u201cDon\u2019t come here, this is a Ghost King, Expelling Talisman\u2019s power can\u2019t deal with him!\u201d Chen Yu saw that the people around her were still rushing in, she felt so anxious and worried.A Ghost King was different from ordinary ghosts, even ordinary ones can take away a human\u2019s life, if Ghost King wanted to harm people, it\u2019s just a matter of him raising his hand. Although her brother and all the special forces had some positive energy, this energy is enough to deal with ordinary evil spirits and is basically useless against a Ghost King.However, their actions still bought Chen Yu some time to recover from the previous attack. Chen Yu took this opportunity to stand up and run to the side, avoiding the Ghost King\u2019s attacks while thinking about how to get out.She\u2019s not capable of fighting against a Ghost King, not to mention that she had no talismans on her right now, but it's still useless even if she had them with her, because everything was futile in front of absolute strength.Chen Yu didn\u2019t expect Qi Changming to be so deranged that he dared to instigate the Ghost King to attack someone in the same profession as him, could it be he\u2019s not afraid of Heaven\u2019s wrath?\u201cBuzz, buzz, buzz!\u201dThe compass hovered over Chen Yu\u2019s head, constantly emitting warning sounds.Is opening Spirit Gate the only way?\u00a0If she can force the Ghost King in, Qi Changming would have to make a lot of effort if he wanted to summon him again.After Chen Yu thought of a way, her spiritual power began to rush into the compass. A golden light flickered from its body as it began to absorb Ghost King\u2019s Yin aura to connect it with the Spirit Gate.\u201cYou want to open Spirit Gate? Don\u2019t even think about it!\u201d Qi Changming sensed the Spirit Gate was about to open, so he changed his tactic once again.The Ghost King stopped attacking Chen Yu, turned around and knocked the compass out of the air. Under its brute strength, the compass\u2019 fluttering light vanished in the distance.The Spirit Gate disappeared before it was fully opened.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about other people, just kill her!\u201d Qi Changming ordered.The Ghost King paused all of a sudden and turned to look at Chen Yu.Chen Yu\u2019s face became pale and she immediately ran off.Lou Ming, who had been informed about the attack a long time ago, stood on the second floor observing the battle through the window.Lou Ming wanted to rush out when Chen Yu hit the rockery, but he was stopped by Cheng Peng. With no way out, he could only send out his men with the Expelling Talismans to help.But when he found that the talismans were of no use, Lou Ming couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201cThird Young Master, you can\u2019t go out for the week of winter solstice.\u201d Chen Peng firmly blocked Lou Ming with his body.\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d Lou Ming shouted with a cold voice.\u201cThird Young Master, it\u2019s useless even if you go out, you will be frozen stiff as soon as you step a foot outside.\u201d Cheng Peng said.\u201c\u2026\u201d Lou Ming stopped, he began to estimate whether his own physical strength could bring him in front of Chen Yu or not.Seeing Lou Ming calm down, Chen Peng heaved a sigh of relief, thinking he had successfully persuaded him.\u201cMiss Chen Yu!\u201d\u201cShishi!\u201dThe shouts that were relayed through Cheng Peng\u2019s intercom snapped Lou Ming back to his senses. When he turned around to look out the window he found Chen Yu suspended midair.Lou Ming anxiously grabbed Cheng Peng\u2019s intercom and shouted, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cThird Young Master, Miss Chen Yu seems to be caught by the neck by something, we can\u2019t get close at all.\u201d He Qi\u2019s anxious voice came from the other end.\u201cThird\u2026\u201dLou Ming pushed Cheng Peng away and quickly ran down the stairs. The moment Lou Ming stepped out of the door, the evil spirit in his body started to go dormant at an unbelievable speed.Lou Ming felt like his whole body was put in a freezer a few hundred degrees below zero, he couldn\u2019t breathe from the cold.\u201cThird Young Master!\u201d Cheng Peng rushed over.Lou Ming supported himself with one hand before he ran to the small park with all of his strength.It was only less than ten meters, but Lou Ming ran especially hard.Chen Yu was being choked by the Ghost King, she was lifted up midair, her face flushed red from the lack of air. Chen Yu\u2019s hard luck and spiritual power invoked the compass to use its remaining power to slam the Ghost King\u2019s arm, before he finally released Chen Yu.Chen Yu rolled and ran while coughing.\u201cHere!\u201d she heard Lou Ming\u2019s voice at this moment.\u201cThird Brother?\u201d Chen Yu looked up in disbelief.\u201cTo\u2026 me\u2026 run here!\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s body was too cold, he really couldn\u2019t move fast.Chen Yu thought of the evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body, she turned around and hastily ran towards Lou Ming\u2019s direction.Lou Ming opened his arms and motioned for her to run into his arms.Chen Yu used the fastest speed ever in her life to run the one-meter distance and jumped right into Lou Ming\u2019s embrace.Lou Ming caught Chen Yu, and unable to withstand the impact he staggered back two steps.The Ghost King ran after Chen Yu. Seeing that Chen Yu stopped, he raised his hands to catch her.Lou Ming keenly sensed that something was approaching, he stretched out his hand to block it and caught an ice-cold arm.The dormant evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body sensed the oncoming danger and immediately became active again. The blood-red evil aura creeped onto the Ghost King\u2019s arm from Lou Ming\u2019s palm, slowly devouring the Ghost King\u2019s black Yin aura.\u201cAa? Roaaarr!!\u201d The Ghost King started shaking his hands in panic, trying to throw off Lou Ming\u2019s hand.But how could Chen Yu let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity? She quickly unlocked the jade clasp seal on Lou Ming\u2019s left hand. Losing its restraint, the evil spirit suddenly raged out, like a huge wave swallowing a small boat, it drowned the Ghost King to nothingness.\u201cROAARRRR!!!\u201dThe Ghost King gave a blood-curdling scream as his soul was swallowed inch by inch by the blood-red evil spirit, he was put to an end instantly, not leaving even a speck of dust behind.Chen Yu saw the Ghost King had been eliminated, so she quickly closed the jade clasp to prevent Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit from leaking out and affecting surrounding people.\u201cThird Brother! Third Brother!!\u201d When Chen Yu raised her head after closing the jade clasp, she found that Lou Ming wasn\u2019t moving anymore, his whole body was as stiff and frozen as an ice sculpture.\u201cThird Brother, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Chen Yu panicked immediately.Author\u2019s NOTE:Cheng Peng: Why do you make me the bad guy every time?Crab: Offending one is better than offending seven.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he saw the faint frost white on Lou Ming\u2019s clothes, he was drained with terror.\u201cGet out of the way!\u201d Cheng Peng pushed the dazed Chen Yu away. With the other assistants who sprinted over, several people together lifted Lou Ming, who was already motionless, back.The push caught Chen Yu off guard. Instead of angrily questioning Assistant Cheng about why he suddenly pushed her away, she slowly unfolded her hands. Her white palms in her vision were red, and that cold touch was still flowing to her brain through her nerves.Both these hands just hugged her Third Brother.Chen Yu snapped back to her senses, and then stretched her legs, running towards the direction of the small building.\u201cMiss Chen Yu.\u201d Chen Yu just started running when He Qi caught up with her and stopped her.\u201cAssistant He, Third Brother, Third Brother, he\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss Chen Yu, Third Young Master will be fine for now,\u201d He Qi comforted.\u201cI want to go see him.\u201d Chen Yu was anxious. How could someone\u2019s body temperature be that low?\u201cBefore you go in, please do Third Young Master a favor,\u201d He Qi said out of the blue.\u201cWhat?\u201d Chen Yu was a bit confused.\u201cJust now, Third Young Master broke his seal just to save you.\u201d He Qi said, \u201cAlthough the time is very short, it also emmanated a lot of evil Qi. To avoid unnecessary trouble, please deal with it.\u201dChen Yu froze. This was not something she had not considered. When she unlocked the jade clasp on Lou Ming\u2019s hand, she had already thought of drawing a Purification Incantation to purify the evil Qi in the surroundings. However, with Lou Ming suddenly having met with an accident moments ago, Chen Yu was too anxious and forgot about it in her panic.Chen Yu nodded, turned around, and walked to the place where the Ghost King had just disappeared. She raised her right hand, condensed spiritual power in her fingertips, and drew a Purification Incantation in the air.The instant the incantation took shape, it immediately dispersed, turning into a myriad of golden light, purifying the air of the remaining evil Qi and Yin Qi.Chen Yang, who had just recovered from the shock and was walking toward his sister, witnessed another scene once more. His sister stood in the open small park and drew randomly in the air with her fingers. Afterward, specks of starlight burst forth and were emitted. What was more amazing was that after the starlight dispersed, the gloomy and depressing small park just now became comfortable just like magic. It was as if the streetlights turned a few shades brighter.This was definitely not a psychological effect.Chen Yang shook his head for a while, and when he returned to his senses, Chen Yu had already run into the small courtyard of the Lou family.When He Qi brought a group of guards over to help earlier, Chen Yang did not think much about it. After all, this was Third Young Master Lou\u2019s domain, and it was normal for guards to come and check once they detected danger. But when Third Young Master Lou personally came out of the small building, his sister plunged directly into his arms. Chen Yang instantly realized that this was not the kind of normal he thought. His sister knew Third Young Master Lou.His younger sister, who had just returned to their home for less than half a year and spent most of her time in the university, not only knew Third Young Master Lou but was also intimately familiar with him.They were so familiar that Third Young Master Lou\u2019s security team came out to defend his sister when she was in danger; so familiar to the point where Third Young Master Lou personally came out to save her.\u201cYoung Master Chen, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The guard at the entrance of the small courtyard reached out to stop Chen Yang who was heading to the door.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Chen Yang would have never approached the small courtyard normally, but Shishi was inside now: \u201cMy sister is inside.\u201d\u201cSorry, but you can\u2019t enter,\u201d the guard responded expressionlessly.Chen Yang fell silent for half a second and lifted his head to look at the lights in the courtyard.When Shishi had just returned home, Third Young Master Lou had sent someone to present her a gift. People never entered and exited the Lous courtyard at will, yet Shishi entered unimpeded. On top of that, Third Young Master Lou personally saved her just now\u2026So, Shishi was safe inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he walked home, he mulled over what had just happened. What was that invisible thing? Why did it attack Shishi?\u201cMy paternal grandpa is an exorcist!\u201dCompass, paper talismans, exorcist, could it be that\u2026This incomparably absurd and so reasonable conjecture made Chen Yang\u2019s metaphysical world view completely collapse. Was his sister an exorcist??Chen Yang stood rooted in place and in his mind replayed the incident; what happened before and after several times over. The more he mulled about it, the more he felt that there was no more plausible explanation than the current conjuncture. He heaved a sigh and decided to have a good talk with Chen Yu when she returned home.Chen Yang started walking forward again, and his eyes fell on a beige down jacket on the roadside, which was tossed on the roadside when he was chasing Chen Yu just now. Chen Yang paused and then walked over to pick it up. He then turned around and walked back to the entrance of the small courtyard of the Lou family.\u201cThis is Shishi\u2019s down jacket. Please help me bring it to her,\u201d Chen Yang begged.The guard took the jacket in Chen Yang\u2019s hand.\u201cAlso\u2026\u201d Chen Yang glanced at the door and said, \u201cPlease tell Shishi. I will inform our parents when I get home that she went back to school for an emergency.\u201dLooking at the situation, Shishi wouldn\u2019t be able to return home tonight. To prevent their parents from worrying, Chen Yang could only help cover her tracks this way.In Lou Ming\u2019s bedroom on the second floor, the seven assistants all crowded into the room. Everyone\u2019s brows were knitted as they looked at their Third Young Master who had frozen into ice on the bed.When the evil spirit in their Third Young Master\u2019s body began to lay dormant, his entire body functions would be frozen by the extreme cold. Although they could stand beside their young master without fear of being affected by the evil Qi, they had never wanted to see their young master in such a state.\u201cHave you contacted Master Mao?\u201d someone asked.\u201cI just did, but Master Mao is out of town and can\u2019t come until dawn,\u201d another person replied.\u201cWhat are we going to do now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo one in the bedroom answered because they all knew that once their Third Young Master was in a state of dormancy, they could only wait until spring. After the beginning of spring, their young master himself would slowly awaken from his hibernation. In the interim, he could only stay asleep.\u201cThird Brother, where is Third Brother?\u201d Chen Yu, who had finished dealing with the evil Qi, pushed the door and ran in, and then saw Lou Ming lying on the bed at a glance.Chen Yu ran to the bedside and immediately sensed that something was wrong. The vital Qi on Lou Ming\u2019s body was slowly disappearing? Chen Yu was so scared that her pupils contracted. She raised her hand to check Lou Ming\u2019s pulse, which was so faint she could hardly feel it anymore.\u201cHow could this happen?\u201d Although the Ghost King was powerful, it was no match against her Third Brother\u2019s evil spirit at all. Hence, he couldn\u2019t be hurt by the Ghost King.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of you!\u201d Cheng Peng couldn\u2019t help but yell.\u201cCheng Peng!\u201d He Qi shouted heavily, \u201cThis is the Third Young Master\u2019s own decision. No one can blame Miss Chen Yu.\u201dCheng Peng, of course, knew that it was the Third Young Master himself who wanted to go out. However, if it wasn\u2019t because of Chen Yu, how could the Third Young Master go out at such a sensitive time.\u201cWhat do you mean because of me? What is going on?\u201d Chen Yu turned to look at the two men and asked, \u201cWhy is Third Brother\u2019s vitality getting weaker and weaker, and why is the evil spirit on his body seemingly vanishing too?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, if there was anyone else here who could help the Third Young Master, it could only be Chen Yu, a Celestial Master.He Qi thought for a moment and then decided to explain the matter to Chen Yu,\u00a0 \u201cThe evil spirit in the Young Master\u2019s body changes with the alternation of spring, summer, autumn and winter seasons. In summer and autumn, the evil spirit will be relatively stable. In spring, the evil spirit is the most active, and in winter, the evil spirit is the weakest.\u201dChen Yu was stunned by what she heard. Because Lou Ming was always with his jade clasp, Chen Yu failed to detect that the evil spirit in his body had changed after winter arrived.\u201cThe evil spirit in the Young Master\u2019s body will begin to lie dormant at the winter solstice.\u201d\u201cDormant?\u201d A possibility flashed through Chen Yu\u2019s mind.\u201cYes,\u201d He Qi continued to explain, \u201cWe can\u2019t find the cause. We only know that around the winter solstice, as soon as Young Master steps into a place with lower temperature, the evil spirit in his body will start to hibernate. Everything develops into this after it hibernates; Young Master will have no breathing, no heartbeat, no body temperature, and no consciousness, and will sleep until the beginning of spring.\u201d\u201cNo wonder. I always feel that the warm air here is distinctly hot.\u201d Chen Yu said in hindsight, \u201cSo\u2026is this kind of dormancy harmful to Third Brother\u2019s body?\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201d If there was no harm and was merely sleeping, the assistants wouldn\u2019t be so worried. \u201cYoung Master\u2019s body temperature drops sharply when he hibernates and slowly revives after the beginning of spring, a condition that can be very damaging to the body. The last time Young Master woke up from an accidental hibernation, he recuperated for a whole month before he barely recovered. The doctor also said\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat else did he say?\u201d Chen Yu urged.\u201cIf this happens frequently, his internal organs are at risk of being overwhelmed,\u201d He Qi frowned and said.As He Qi\u2019s words fell, the remaining six assistants all blamed themselves.\u201cIt\u2019s all because we didn\u2019t protect Third Young Master.\u201d\u201cEveryone professes to be the King of Soldiers, but can\u2019t even do this job right.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dChen Yu felt that every self-reproach from the assistants was directed at her. It was because of her that Lou Ming went out.So what could she do? What could she do to help her Third Brother? Chen Yu tried hard to rack her brains.Evil spirit, evil spirit dormancy?Chen Yu\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up, and she asked anxiously, \u201cThe dormancy is because the evil spirit will sink completely into silence. At the beginning of spring, the evil spirit begins to recover, so Third Brother wakes up, right?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d He Qi nodded.\u201cI have an idea!\u201d After Chen Yu finished speaking, she turned around and walked quickly to the bed. She casually kicked off her shoes with both feet, and then directly climbed on Lou Ming\u2019s bed.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The assistants looked puzzled.\u201cI\u2019m trying to see if I can manage to resuscitate Third Brother up,\u201d Chen Yu answered.\u201cHow are you going to even try?\u201d He Qi asked reflexively.Chen Yu lay on top of Lou Ming through the blanket, leaving the assistants with a \u201cDon\u2019t disturb me\u201d command.The next moment, she bowed and kissed Lou Ming\u2019s lips.\u201cHiss!\u201d The assistants caught their breaths.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d When Cheng Peng saw that Chen Yu dared to molest his Third Young Master, he was so angry that he charged forward, intending to pull her away.Tian Fei nimbly stopped Cheng Peng and whispered, \u201cYou forgot \u2013 the research room!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Brimming with hope, they each looked at the two kissing on the bed. However, now that they were watching, why did it suddenly feel wrong? Say, a man and a woman were kissing in bed. What were they, seven big old men, watching them for?It was not known who was the first to turn around, but the remaining six followed suit, one after the other.\u201cCough\u2026Isn\u2019t it inappropriate for us to do this?\u201d someone whispered.\u201cLet\u2019s all go out,\u201d He Qi suddenly said, after weighing the matter for a moment.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d The moment Cheng Peng voiced his objection, Tian Fei along with another assistant next to him dragged him out of the bedroom.The rest of the assistants also followed, and He Qi walked last. He closed the door and guarded it.Meanwhile, inside the room, Chen Yu, who was concentrating on kissing Lou Ming, uh, no, transmitting Qi, finally sensed the faint evil spirit inside Lou Ming\u2019s body that hadn\u2019t completely gone dormant.Chen Yu had no clue why the spirit qi in her body could sense the evil spirit, and she could sense it through a mental method. Chen Yu also asked the old man when she was young, and the old man always said that she had a special physique and extraordinary talent.Regardless of the reason, for once, Chen Yu was truly grateful for her extraordinary talent, which allowed her to work on the evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body.Most of the evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body was dormant. Chen Yu was struggling to work on the evil spirit, but fortunately, the Spirit Qi in the small building was very abundant, and she has enough spiritual power to use.As time ticked by, Chen Yu gripped Lou Ming\u2019s hands, and let spirit qi and evil qi run between them through their interlocked palms. Because the evil qi in Lou Ming\u2019s body was tremendous, every once in a while Chen Yu felt short of spirit qi, at which point she would lower her head to Lou Ming\u2019s mouth and take a mouthful of breath, and then absorb the excess evil qi in his body into her own. Once her spirit qi was enough, she would circulate it back through the mental method.Time passed unknowingly, but Lou Ming\u2019s stiff body began to soften. His body slowly got warm, and his tightly shut eyelids trembled slightly and slowly opened.Lou Ming was still very weak, and his consciousness was fuzzy. He stared at the person in front of him for a while.What is Shishi doing?A sudden wave of fatigue hit Lou Ming. He wanted to sleep again, but before losing consciousness, he felt a touch of warmth and softness attached to his lips.Lou Ming did not sleep long, and he woke up when dawn broke.He froze for a second when he felt someone holding his hand. He turned sideways and found the sleeping girl, lying beside him.The girl\u2019s right hand was holding his right hand, lying sound asleep on her side. The girl had a head of chestnut curly hair and a fair little face flushed with sleep. Her long eyelashes hid her black gem-like eyes, which always sparkled when open.Then\u2026Lou Ming\u2019s gaze unconsciously fell on her partly open red lips.\u201cThird Brother, I took advantage of you.\u201d Lou Ming remembered the innocence that existed in the girl\u2019s eyes when she said this.\u201cLuckily, no outsiders will ever know what has transpired here,\u201d Lou Ming sighed and quietly released her hand. He carefully got up from the bed, and then covered Chen Yu with a quilt before he turned around and walked out of the bedroom.From now on, he couldn\u2019t let this little girl take advantage of him again. With his back turned, Lou Ming showed a wry smile.\u2014The author has something to say:Crab: Why can\u2019t you let Xishi take advantage of you again?Third Young Master: What do you think?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he saw that Chen Yu was still asleep and wasn\u2019t roused, he heaved a sigh of relief.\u00a0 Then he quickly walked out of the room and smoothly closed the door.\u201cKeep your voices down,\u201d Lou Ming frowned and commanded.The seven assistants immediately quieted down.Lou Ming looked at the people who were crowded together at the door early in the morning and suddenly remembered something. He squinted at the seven assistants in front of him and asked, \u201cYou\u2026have you all been staying up here since last night?\u201dThe assistants nodded.Lou Ming\u2019s face drastically turned ugly again: \u201cDid any of you enter?\u201dRelying on the crisis awareness the assistants accumulated from life and death lines, they shook their heads in unison.Only then did Lou Ming relax. He grunted before he turned around and walked downstairs, with the gazes of his assistants filled with guilt glued on his back.Seeing that Lou Ming was awake, the assistants were in the best spirits. Knowing that their Third Young Master was alright, they all left the small building and went back to their dormitory, leaving only He Qi behind, the assistant on duty for the day.Lou Ming sat on the sofa in the living room, looked up and asked, \u201cWho did you notify about the incident last night?\u201d\u201cWe notified Master Mao. Master Mao is currently out of town, so he should be arriving in the morning,\u201d He Qi answered. He looked at his watch and said, \u201cHe should be here soon.\u201d\u201cOnly Master Mao?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cMiss Chen Yu said she has a way to cure you, so we\u2026we chose not to notify the Minister,\u201d He Qi replied.A hint of surprise appeared on Lou Ming\u2019s expression. He was obviously surprised that He Qi did not notify his father at the first opportunity after he fell unconscious: \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been your assistant for so many years, yet you\u2019ve never made any special requests to us, nor even given us specific orders,\u201d He Qi laughed bitterly, \u201cIt was only anything in regards to Miss Chen Yu that you \u4e00\u4e00 this was the only time you made demands of us.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, no matter who arranged for us to come here, all of us are here as your assistants. As long as your life isn\u2019t threatened, we will put your orders first,\u201d He Qi solemnly added on with his response.Lou Ming obviously did not expect to hear such words. After a moment of silence, Lou Ming could not help but express his thanks, \u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cThis is our duty,\u201d He Qi finished and gave a standard military salute to Lou Ming.Just then,a sudden commotion erupted at the door. They turned their heads and saw Master Mao in Daoist robes barging into the living room. While running, he shouted, \u201cWhere\u2019s Lou Ming? How\u2019s Lou Ming now?\u201d\u201cMaster Mao.\u201d The moment Lou Ming saw Master Mao, he immediately stood up and greeted him.\u201cLou Ming!!!\u201d Master Mao\u2019s shocked pair of squinting eyes bulged into round and large eyes: \u201cYou\u2026Aren\u2019t you supposed to be hibernating?\u201d\u201cI just woke up from a nap,\u201d Lou Ming replied with some amusement.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter knowing that it was a false alarm, Master Mao, whose heart was torn with anxiety all night, sat in the living room together with Lou Ming and had a conversation about the situation last night.\u201cWhat happened last night?\u201d Master Mao remarked, \u201cYou never leave the small building around the winter solstice.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There are a lot of people in this compound, and it\u2019s always unsafe for a very dangerous, powerful malevolent ghost to haunt the neighborhood,\u201d Lou Ming said, \u201cBesides, my evil spirit will lie dormant in a low-temperature state. Hence, even if I went out, I shouldn\u2019t have been able to discharge too much evil qi.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve thought everything through, except for one thing\u2026,\u201d Master Mao reminded, \u201cYou forgot about yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lou Ming fell silent.\u201cLou Ming, you care more about Little Friend Chen than I thought,\u201d Master Mao suddenly said out of the blue.\u201cI didn\u2019t do it only for Shishi\u2019s sake, but for\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t rush to explain first,\u201d Master Mao interrupted Lou Ming and said, \u201cBefore Little Friend Chen returned to this compound, this compound had been very clean. Not even a single wandering spirit had appeared.\u00a0 If you truly care for the wellbeing of the compound\u2019s residents, you should inform your father about this and then have Mayor Chen\u2019s family move out of the compound.\u201dLou Ming\u2019s face changed, and his palms clenched into a ball offists\u201cYou have always been aware of the dangers of the evil spirit in your body. Right from the beginning, when we talked about letting you live here because there was abundant spirit qi in this small building, you disagreed to reside here, considering that it was right smack in the city center, and there were also other people living in the compound. You were afraid that your evil spirit will suddenly get out of control one day and hurt the the surrounding people,\u201d\u00a0 Master Mao said, \u201cLater, I repeatedly assured you that the arrays I set up in the courtyard can guarantee that as long as you do not step out of the courtyard, even if your evil spirit breaks out, it will not affect the people outside of the array in the the compound. So you reluctantly stayed.\u201d\u201cYet now, you took the initiative on your own to step out of the small courtyard and unlock the jade clasp for the sake of Little Friend Chen alone.\u201dLou Ming suddenly raised his head. His face was pale, and there was a trace of panic in his eyes. Lou Ming\u2019s panic did not originate from Master Mao\u2019s questioning, but from the sudden realization that everything Master Mao said was right. He did care about Chen Yu\u2026\u201cYour care for Little Friend Chen is abnormal. What exactly do you\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m done for! I\u2019m done for! I\u2019m done for!\u2026\u201d A series of screams that wailed from the second floor interrupted Master Mao\u2019s unfinished sentence. The two turned their heads\u00a0 and saw Chen Yu, running down from the second floor in a panic.\u201cThird Brother, how are you feeling now?\u201d Chen Yu ran to the living room and saw Lou Ming sitting downstairs at a glance.In fact, before going to sleep last night, Chen Yu had already checked Lou Ming\u2019s condition that his vital qi and evil spirit had recovered. It was only because she did not see Lou Ming wake up with her own eyes that she still felt slightly uneasy.\u201cI\u2019m fine. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cI was in too much of a hurry when I came out last night, and I didn\u2019t return home afterwards, so my parents right now must be anxious,\u201d Chen Yu had been thinking for a while as\u00a0 to how to explain herself, but she still couldn\u2019t come up with a reasonable excuse after pondering for a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Young Master Chen came by last night and said he would notify Mayor Chen and Mrs. Chen that you had an emergency last night and went back to school.\u201d\u201cMy brother?\u201d Chen Yu remembered. She seemed to have dropped her down jacket in front of her elder brother last night: \u201cDid my brother say anything else?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d He Qi shook his head.Seeing Chen Yu holding her down jacket in a daze, Lou Ming walked to her and said, \u201cSince Chen Yang has explained it for you, you don\u2019t need to hurry home. Let\u2019s have breakfast first.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d Chen Yu gave it a thought and felt that what Third Brother said made sense. Hence, she greeted Master Mao and sat down on the sofa in the living room.\u201cGo and prepare breakfast, and bring the medical kit by the way,\u201d Lou Ming instructed He Qi.\u201cRoger.\u201d In a short while, He Qi brought the medical kit back.Lou Ming took the medical kit and walked over to Chen Yu, who raised her head in confusion.\u201cThe wound on your forehead needs to be treated,\u201d Lou Ming said.Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but lift her hand and touch her forehead, causing her to gasp in pain. Her reaction made Lou Ming frown: \u201cDon\u2019t touch it.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Chen Yu immediately sat down obediently.Lou Ming carefully disinfected Chen Yu with iodophor, and then put on the gauze.Master Mao, who was sitting aside and drinking tea, silently watched the scene. The more he watched, the more serious his expression became.Not long after the wound was bandaged, Chen Yu smiled sweetly at Lou Ming: \u201cThank you, Third Brother.\u201d\u201cBe careful in the future,\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but admonish.\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu nodded obediently, and then took the big apple on the coffee table and began taking bites on it.\u00a0 While nibbling, she also asked Master Mao nearby, \u201cMaster Mao, why does Third Brother\u2019s evil spirit lie dormant around the winter solstice?\u201dMaster Mao shook his head and answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know the exact reason why. I just grasped the pattern through observation.\u201d\u201cWinter solstice? The winter solstice indicates that winter is coming. The weather will become colder, and animals will hibernate\u2026\u201d Chen Yu frowned, \u201cBut none of this seems to have anything to do with evil spirits.\u201d\u201cI have studied this for a long time, but still can not find the answer. However,\u2026\u201d Master Mao looked at Chen Yu and asked, \u201cOnce Lou Ming hibernates, he will fall completely asleep and will sleep until the next beginning of spring.\u00a0 I\u2019m curious. Little Friend Chen, through what method did you wake up Lou Ming last night?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cCough!\u201d Lou Ming, who was listening to the two in silence, couldn\u2019t help but to cough awkwardly. When the two looked at him in surprise, Lou Ming calmly interjected, \u201cBreakfast is ready. Let\u2019s go eat first.\u201d\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d The moment Chen Yu heard that there was food, she jumped up happily and ran away.Master Mao glanced at Lou Ming, and the corners of his mouth curled up in a smile. He also followed and walked to the dining room.Lou Ming awkwardly touched his nose, slowly trailing behind.After eating breakfast, Master Mao asked again, \u201cI heard Lou Ming say that last night, Little Friend Chen met a tough and powerful malevolent ghost?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a powerful malevolent ghost; it\u2019s a Ghost King,\u201d Chen Yu shook her head and said.\u201cGhost King?\u201d Master Mao\u2019s expression changed: \u201cSomeone invited the Ghost King of the underworld?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the Underworld\u2019s Ghost King,\u201d Chen Yu explained, \u201cThat Ghost King last night was artificially refined.\u201d\u201cThere is a Celestial Master refining a Ghost King?\u201d Master Mao cried incredulously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Have you heard of this person, Master Mao?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cThat Ghost King last night was sent by this Celestial Master named Qi Changming?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cYeah, I have fought with him before and have seen this Ghost King,\u201d Chen Yu nodded and replied.\u201cYou have fought with him before?\u201d Master Mao was surprised.\u201cThen were you okay that time?\u201d Lou Ming thought of the Ghost King\u2019s ferocity and couldn\u2019t help but worry.\u201cI\u2019m alright. At that time, he summoned the Ghost King through a ghost token. I smashed the ghost token into pieces with one foot and the Ghost King disappeared right after, so he didn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d Chen Yu huffed: \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s so petty. He couldn\u2019t beat me, so he went so far as to summon a Ghost King to assassinate me afterwards.\u201d\u201cMaster Mao, have you ever heard of this person?\u201d Lou Ming\u2019s impression of this Qi Changming plummeted nethermost.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of him.\u201d Master Mao shook his head and said, \u201cBut nowadays, there are few sects that still use the Soul Refining Formation to refine malevolent ghosts, not to mention refining a Ghost King. I\u2019ll go back and ask someone to further investigate. There should be news soon.\u201d\u201cMaster Mao, can you please do me a favor?\u201d Chen Yu suddenly looked at Master Mao.\u201cLittle Friend Chen, do say,\u201d Master Mao was a little curious about what Chen Yu would ask of him.\u201cHere\u2019s the thing. That Qi Changming is bad. I\u2019m not afraid of him, but I\u2019m afraid he will do something against my family, so\u2026\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cMaster Mao, I don\u2019t want any money for those jades, but can you send me three pieces of amulets?\u201d\u201cWhat jade? What money?\u201d Master Mao felt that he couldn\u2019t understand a word.\u201cOh, that one. Didn\u2019t you say that the jades which Assistant Tian brought back the other day were particularly suitable for amulets?\u201d Lou Ming hurriedly picked up the conversation.\u201cYeah! That\u2019s the one.\u201d Chen Yu nodded in agreement at the side.Master Mao blinked, and after adding and subtracting the two\u2019s meanings, he finally comprehended: \u201cYou want me to use those dead jades and help you make a few amulets?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu immediately nodded happily, while Lou Ming let out a long sigh of relief.Master Mao always felt that something was wrong, but in the end, he did not refuse.When Chen Yu left home, her phone was forgotten in her room. Chen Yu, without her phone, always felt uneasy, so she stayed for a short while before getting up and leaving, intending to go back and secretly fetch her phone, and then go back to school.Lou Ming watched Chen Yu leave, and then met Master Mao\u2019s probing gaze.Lou Ming pondered for a moment and admitted particularly dryly, \u201cI do care about her.\u201d\u201cNo more denial?\u201d Master Mao was instead a little surprised.\u201cI can\u2019t hide it from you anyway,\u201d Lou Ming replied with a bitter smile.\u201cAlthough Little Friend Chen is not afraid of your evil spirit, the gap between you is too much. On age alone\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster Mao, you\u2019re overthinking it.

Considering her forehead injury, it would be difficult to explain if she was seen by Mother Chen, so Chen Yu planned to sneak in through the window, take her mobile phone and head back to school. By the time winter break was over, her forehead wound would have healed\u2026With this thought in mind, Chen Yu climbed the parasol tree behind the house with ease. She lifted her foot and was about to step on the windowsill when she looked up and met her elder brother\u2019s strange gaze.\u201cBig\u2026Big Brother?\u201d Chen Yu silently retracted her right foot that was about to step on the windowsill.

She was filled with embarrassment, but still moved skillfully when she jumped in.Seeing his sister\u2019s skilled and lithe movements, Chen Yang suddenly felt that he might have discovered how his sister had hitched a ride with Third Young Master Lou under his nose.\u201cBig Brother, you\u2026why are you in my room?\u201d Chen Yu was a little surprised.\u00a0Is it for last night\u2019s matter?\u201cThe glass of your room window suddenly broke, so I\u2019m measuring the size and let someone fix it later,\u201d Chen Yang explained.\u201cOh\u2026oh.\u201d With her elder brother\u2019s reminder, Chen Yu then found that her room\u2019s window really had shattered to pieces.

And even\u2026leave it at Third Young Master\u2019s house?\u201d\u201cLast night, the compass\u2019s spirit Qi was depleted. Spirit Qi is denser in Third Brother\u2019s home, so I left it there, so that the compass can absorb spirit qi,\u201d Chen Yu explained.\u201cSpirit Qi\u2026\u201d Chen Yang never imagined that these terms that were only read in novels really existed.\u201cEn, Third Brother\u2019s house has the densest spirit qi concentration in the entire capital,\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cSo\u2026you also only got acquainted with Third Young Master Lou because of spirit qi? \u201cChen Yang guessed.\u201cUh? Yeah.\u201d Since Chen Yang had already discovered what happened last night, Chen Yu did not intend to hide it anymore.Chen Yang took a deep breath, put down the ruler in his hand and took another look at the room\u2019s door that he closed tightly by himself before he asked out loud, \u201cWhat exactly was that thing last night?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a Ghost King, and it was Qi Changming who let him out,\u201d Chen Yu answered.\u201cGhost King?

Moreover, the country does not advocate feudal superstition.\u201d\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t chased after you last night and found out about it, would you still have kept it from me?\u201d When Chen Yang said this, he suddenly remembered that he once met Chen Yu in the middle of the night: \u201cWhen I met you that night, you actually didn\u2019t go to an Internet cafe, nor are addicted to games; you went to deal with your so-called metaphysical business, that is, to catch ghosts, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Chen Yu nodded honestly.\u201cOver the past few months, without our knowledge, you dealt with\u2026How many times did you go out to catch ghosts?\u201d Chen Yang asked.\u201cI c-can\u2019t remember.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t remember? Has it been so many times that you can no longer count?\u201d The more Chen Yang asked, the angrier he became: \u201cDid you go of your own accord, or are there already so many ghosts and ghouls in the capital that you can run into them at any time?\u201d\u201cI took the initiative,\u201d Chen Yu answered sheepishly.\u201cWhy on earth are you doing these things? Did the state also give you Celestial Masters assignments?\u201d Chen Yang roared.\u201cI-I want to build a road.\u201d Chen Yu did not understand why her elder brother was so angry.\u201cWhat?\u201d Chen Yang was somewhat lost.\u201cI want to build a road. I promised my grandfather and the Village Chief when I left Damu Village that I would build a mountain road leading to the city for the village.\u201d Chen Yu looked at Chen Yang aggrievedly. \u201cI\u2019ve told you guys about it before, ah.\u201dChen Yang was rendered speechless for a moment. Chen Yu was right. She did tell them about it. She had mentioned it a long time ago. She also asked them how much it would cost to construct a winding mountain highway. Their father also promised his sister to ask a friend from Qingmu Province about road construction there, but he merely never got the exact information\u201cAre you doing it to earn money?\u201d Chen Yang understood.\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu nodded.\u201cDo you know how much it costs to build a winding mountain road?

Do you think you can earn it alone?\u201d Chen Yang, who came to understand, still had a fire in his belly, toward Chen Yu for overestimating her capabilities.\u201cI don\u2019t know how much it costs, but I just want to earn a little more in advance,\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cA few years ago, the Village Chief said the government was already going to help build the road, but because of the subsequent shortfall of 200 million, the project was put on hold again. So, I just want to earn 200 million first.\u201dAfter Chen Yu finished speaking, she turned around and fished out a bank card from the drawer and happily exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ve already earned almost 40 million. At this rate, I\u2019ll be able to save enough before I graduate from university.\u201dChen Yang was frightened by his sister\u2019s terrifying earning speed, but such overwhelming power and ability to earn money was definitely accompanied by great dangers with it.Chen Yang looked at the snow-white gauze on his sister\u2019s forehead and was reminded of when she was thrown on the rockery by the Ghost King, being strangled in the neck mid-air last night. He imagined Chen Yu fighting those invisible ghosts and monsters in places he couldn\u2019t see. She would suffer a lot of injuries all over but also dared not to raise the matter to her family. He suddenly hated himself, hated his own incompetence.Chen Yang was six years older than Chen Yu. When Chen Yu went missing, Chen Yang became mentally mature far beyond kids his age. For more than ten years, Chen Yang would feel uncomfortable as long as he thinks of his lost sister. Then he always told himself that once his sister was found later, he would protect her well and not let anyone hurt her again.But now that his sister was back, he could only watch her get hurt and couldn\u2019t even get closer. Chen Yang suddenly realized that, in fact, he had no qualification to get angry at Chen Yu, because he could not do anything.\u201cDoes Third Young Master Lou often help you?\u201d \u201d Chen Yang suddenly asked.\u201cEn, Third Brother has saved me several times,\u201d Chen Yu answered without thinking.\u201cSeveral times?\u201d\u00a0So you really get hurt a lot?Chen Yang pursed his lips, brimming with frustration. He took a deep look at Chen Yu, picked up the ruler on the table, turned around and left Chen Yu\u2019s room.He was incapable of catching ghosts, but it was not difficult for him to keep an eye on Qi Changming.When Chen Yu saw her brother, who was raging furiously just seconds ago, suddenly leave, she couldn\u2019t help but blink in confusion.But she soon shook off her doubts. She found her phone and went to get the linen bag containing her talismans. After a moment\u2019s deliberation, she opened her phone and left a message for her grandpa.I want to Fix Road: Old man, I encountered a Ghost King yesterday and almost died. What should I do when I meet the Ghost King again?Grandpa Wu\u2019s avatar was gray. Apparently, he wasn\u2019t online, but Chen Yu had long been used to it. She put her phone into her pocket, familiarly flipped out of the back window, and then carefully avoided her yard door and walked to the gate.Chen Yang, who just drove out of the house to go to the police station, saw a familiar figure in front of him. He did not remember seeing Chen Yu on the first floor. His first guess was that this girl must have jumped out of the window again.Feeling deeply helpless, Chen Yang honked the horn and parked the car next to Chen Yu: \u201cGet in the car. I\u2019ll take you back to school.\u201d\u201cThank you, Big Brother.\u201d Chen Yu immediately boarded the car happily. Losing her vest wasn\u2019t at all that bad.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Qi also brought the medical team into the small building to help Lou Ming do a full body examination, and the test results also indicated that he was very healthy.\u201cIt seems that Little Friend Chen does have a few special points.\u201d Master Mao asked, \u201cHas Little Friend Chen\u2019s grandfather been contacted?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Lou Ming replied, \u201cShishi recounted my situation to her grandfather, but it seems that the old man doesn\u2019t have a solution either. But Shishi said that when her grandfather comes to the capital, she will ask him to come over and personally examine my condition.\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019ll just have to wait.\u201d Master Mao sighed.\u201cMaster Mao, are there any particulars about your Celestial Master magic tools?\u201d Lou Ming suddenly asked.\u201cMagic tools? Why are you suddenly concerned about this?\u201d Master Mao was surprised.\u201cShishi does not seem to have any other magic tools except for her talismans and her compass,\u201d Lou Ming said, \u201cBut the function of the compass is mainly for defense and calculation. The attack power of talismans is also limited, so I wonder if I can help Shishi find an attack-type magic tool for defense.\u201dLou Ming could not help but frown as soon as he thought of how Chen Yu looked yesterday when she could only passively dodge attacks because her talismans were not with her.\u201cAttack-type magic tool?\u201d Master Mao pondered for a moment and said, \u201cThe magic tools used by various sects are different, but the most common are peach wooden sword and bronze sword. The older the magic tool is, the stronger the spiritual power it has, and the more powerful it is.\u201d\u201cBronze sword?\u201d Lou Ming immediately thought of the magic weapon that might have been his possession in his previous life.\u201cDo you want to give that bronze sword to Little Friend Chen?\u201d Master Mao guessed from Lou Ming\u2019s expression.\u201cIf I file a report and apply to the top, I should be able to get that bronze sword,\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Master Mao remembered the morning Lou Ming told him that he cared about her, so he changed his words, \u201cTheoretically speaking, it\u2019s possible. Didn\u2019t Little Friend Chen borrow the bronze sword last time?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Lou Ming nodded and asked, \u201cBy the way, Master Mao, there is one more thing I want to trouble you with.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you asking me for anything after so many years. But today, you did so, one thing after another. Is it for Little Friend Chen again?\u201d Master Mao asked.\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2026\u201d Lou Ming replied with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s for myself. I want you to unlock the seal on my eyes.\u201d\u201cDo you want to restore your Ying Yang eyes?\u201d Lou Ming had been able to see ghosts since he was a child because he was born with an evil aura. When he was young, Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit was not as huge as it was today. Many ghosts and monsters liked to approach Lou Ming.\u00a0 The young Lou Ming was terrified, so Master Mao employed a technique to seal his Yin Yang eyes.Later, when Lou Ming grew up, the evil spirit in him grew stronger, deterring ordinary ghosts and monsters from daring to approach him, but Lou Ming also didn\u2019t deliberately lift the seal. After all, the seal didn\u2019t have any impact on his life.\u00a0 But today, why did he suddenly consider breaking his seal?\u201cYou\u2019re still doing it for Little Friend Chen, to better protect her when she\u2019s in danger,\u201d Master Mao said with certainty.\u201cMaster Mao,\u201d Lou Ming began in a serious tone, \u201cI used to always think about staying away from the people around me so as not to harm them.\u00a0 Only Shishi, she is \u4e00\u4e00 she is the only one I want to protect and can also protect.\u201cSigh!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had never occurred to him that even a person like Lou Ming would fall in love. Love between men and women was truly the most complicated thing of all time.\u00a0Fortunately I became a monk early.After dinner, Chen Yu, who was studying in the library, finally received a reply from the old man.I am Big Account: You met the Ghost King?\u00a0 How did you get so lucky that you ran into the Ghost King from the underworld when he came out for a stroll?I want to Fix the Road: It\u2019s not from the underworld, but a Ghost King refined by a Celestial Master. It\u2019s estimated that it had devoured a lot of souls.I am Big Account: Refined Ghost King? Is it a Celestial Master from the White Mountain Sect?I want to Fix the Road: I don\u2019t know. I only know that he is called Qi Changming. He also used a spell to threaten me.I am Big Account: He also used a spell to threaten you???I want to Fix the Road: Yeah, but he didn\u2019t succeed, and instead suffered from my violent beating.\u00a0 Also, because of this, he actually sent the Ghost King to kill me afterwards. If not for Third Brother\u2019s help, I would have died.I am Big Account: Who asked you not to study well? Look now, a man-made Ghost King reduced you into this.Chen Yu rolled her eyes. However, recalling how she refused to learn the variety of arts the old man did try to teach her, she could only type:Then teach me again. I will definitely learn this time.I am Big Account: I\u2019ll send a copy of the manual on how to summon the real Ghost King to your mailbox. It can fend off ten of these impostors without any problems.Chen Yu was delighted. She wanted to ask some more questions, but the old man\u2019s avatar immediately turned gray again.\u201cYou went offline again. Do you have any love for your grandchild, huh? I almost died, but you don\u2019t know how to comfort me,\u201d Chen Yu tossed her phone on the table.Meanwhile, in a certain city in a certain Internet cafe, an old man emerged from a private compartment.\u201cYo, old man, want to order takeout again?\u201d The cyber cafe manager saw the old man and asked solicitously.\u201cNo, help me to book a plane ticket for me to Qiyang,\u201d the old man replied.\u201cOld man, are you leaving?\u00a0 The national battle is in two days. Are you not going to play?\u201d The manager asked.\u201cI will. I\u2019ll be back in two days,\u201d Two day were enough for a trip to Qiyang and demolishing the White Mountain Sect.They dare to bully my granddaughter. It seems that I have been away from the Jianghu for too long!!!\u2014The author has something to say:Qi Changming: A man must bear the consequences of his actions.Grandpa Wu: Nice try!Qiyang Airport.An old man dressed in a gray sweater and dark blue jeans, black sneakers, fashionable sunglasses, sporting a black backpack on his back, and a pair of tawdry red headphones on his ears walked out of the airport with a flourish.His fashionable regalia spoke volumes that he was a master with money, ah. The touts drivers waiting for customers at the front entrance were ready to pull customers in, and eventually. A middle-aged man who was closest to the exit took the lead.\u201cOld Sir, where are you going? Do you want a ride?\u201d The middle-aged driver asked solicitously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Old Sir, you are traveling to White Mountain, correct?\u201d It would take three or four hours to drive from the airport to White Mountain, but this trip would provide the driver with a day\u2019s worth of income.The old man got into the taxi and asked casually, \u201cHow long does it take to get to White Mountain from here?\u201d\u201cThree to four hours if we drive fast. Almost four to five hours if we drive slower,\u201d the middle-aged driver answered as he drove.The old man took out his phone and saw that it was already two o\u2019clock in the afternoon. No matter how he counted, it would already be evening once they got there. He pondered for a moment and asked, \u201cAre there any hotels there?\u201d\u201cYes, White Mountain is a famous attraction in Qiyang Province. How can there be no hotels?\u201d the middle-aged driver replied.\u201cAttraction?\u201d The old man was quite surprised.\u201cYou don\u2019t often travel, do you?\u201d The middle-aged driver enthusiastically began his introductions, \u201cWe have a White Mountain Sect on White Mountain. The talismans that the White Mountain Sect monks draw are especially full of spiritual power. The Sect Master, Gu Rufeng, in particular is said to be able to summon the gales and command the rain and turn stones into gold with a single touch. He can also treat intractable diseases, and has extraordinary abilities. Every year, countless people from all over the country come to see Patriarch Gu. Since you\u2019re going to White Mountain, why don\u2019t you stop by and take a look? If you encounter Patriarch Gu outside of the mountain, you may also be able to ask for a Peace Talisman.\u201d\u201cGu Rufeng?\u201d Grandpa Wu raised his eyebrows in surprise: \u201cSince when did this kid start dancing with the gurus?\u201d\u201cHa?\u201d The middle-aged driver didn\u2019t hear what Grandpa Wu said clearly, \u201cOld Sir, what did you just say?\u201d\u201cI said I know Gu Rufeng,\u201d Grandpa Wu replied, \u201cI\u2019m going to White Mountain this time to look for him, but I haven\u2019t been here for more than twenty years, so I didn\u2019t know that he was doing so well.\u201d\u201cOld Sir, the moment I saw you, I thought you had an extraordinary deportment. It turns out that you and Patriarch Gu are acquaintances.\u201d The middle-aged driver never imagined that he had reigned in a high-profile customer, so he immediately said with some excitement, \u201cOld Sir, can you help me ask for two Peace Talismans of the White Mountain Sect? Please don\u2019t laugh at me. I\u2019ve made seven or eight trips to White Mountain a year, but I\u2019ve never gotten even a single Peace Talisman once.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in such great demand?\u201d\u00a0Isn\u2019t that old fellow, Gu Rufeng, only raising ghosts? When did he change to drawing Peace Talismans?\u201cExactly! So if it\u2019s convenient for you, Old Sir, please help me ask for two. I won\u2019t charge you for this trip, and when you return from the White Mountain later, I can also drive to pick you up. Is that okay for you?\u201d the middle-aged driver said expectantly.\u201cOkay. When we arrive in White Mountain, find a hotel there too and stay with me. Tomorrow, I will also take your car back to the airport,\u201d Grandpa Wu said.\u201cYou\u2019re just staying for one night?\u201d the middle-aged driver asked in surprise.\u201cYes, I have something to do later.\u201d That old fellow, Gu Rufeng, had changed from raising ghosts to selling talismans instead. Grandpa Wu estimated that his cultivation had regressed so badly, so cleaning up after him for one night was enough. He would then take a plane back to participate in the national battle afterwards. He had already promised to his internet gaming buddies.\u201cIt\u2019s also true that experts like you are busy, all very busy.\u201d The middle-aged driver nodded repeatedly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He blamed that old fellow, Gu Rufeng, for depriving him two days of game time. Hence, he stayed up all night last night to enhance his equipment, and so right then he was terribly sleepy.Because Grandpa Wu was sleeping the whole journey, the driver was afraid of accidentally waking him up, so he drove slower than usual on the way. When they arrived at White Mountain, it was almost seven o\u2019clock in the evening.The driver not only did not charge Grandpa Wu for the fare, but also took the initiative to help him book a room to thank him for his promise to help him obtain a Peace Talisman.When Grandpa Wu was young, he was also a man who had seen the world (used to being flattered). Without any hesitation, he took the room card handed over by the middle-aged driver and went to the room with a flourish.When the middle-aged driver behind him saw Grandpa Wu\u2019s behavior, his confidence that Grandpa Wu could get a Peace Talisman was reinforced.\u00a0An expert, ah, he\u2019s worthy of being an expert. Don\u2019t all experts behave in this manner?Grandpa Wu first ate his dinner in the room. Seeing that the clock had struck eight o\u2019clock, he then carried his black hiking bag out of the hotel and walked all the way to the mountain top of the White Mountain Sect.When he reached the entrance of the White Mountain Sect, Grandpa Wu looked at the imposing Chinese-style garden that only appeared on TV and sighed: \u201cTsk, tsk, it seems they have earned a lot of money.\u201d\u201cKnock, knock.\u201d Grandpa Wu went forward and knocked on the door.\u201cCreak~\u201d With the sound of the door opening, a young man in a Chinese tunic opened the door. He impatiently took a look at Grandpa Wu in front of the door and chided snappily, \u201cIt\u2019s already closed. Come back tomorrow if you want a Peace Talisman.\u201dWhat temper did Grandpa Wu have? No one but his granddaughter would dare to talk to him like that.Grandpa Wu\u2019s eyes narrowed into slits. He raised his foot and threw a kick. With only a resounding \u2018boom\u2019, the two meters high wooden door crashed to the ground with a bang.The young disciple, standing in the middle of the door, was terrified, his face turned white. He stared at Grandpa Wu with eyes full of fear: \u201cYou\u2026you\u2026you \u2026\u201d\u201cIs that old fellow, Gu Rufeng, here?\u201d Grandpa Wu pushed the frightened young disciple aside and strode in through the large wooden door that he had kicked down. When he stepped on it, a loud crack sounded.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dWhen the White Mountain Sect disciples, who heard the loud noise, ran out and saw the gate that collapsed to the ground, each stared wide-eyed in astonishment.\u201cHow did the gate fall down?\u201d The crowd sought to ask the young disciple at the door, but unfortunately, the young disciple still hadn\u2019t recovered from the shock.\u201cWhat\u2019s all this noise?\u201d A middle-aged man dressed in a long green robe came out of the house.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cMartial Uncle.\u201dThe young disciples in the courtyard bowed to the middle-aged man.\u201cLi Ye, what happened to the gate?\u201d the middle-aged man asked the young disciple who first opened the door.\u201cMaster, he-he-he kicked it down.\u201d You could say Li Ye had finally regained his senses. He stretched his hand and pointed to the hall, and reported restlessly.Everybody turned to look, and then they found that there was a man sitting on the main seat of the audience hall of their clan\u2019s door somehow\u2026The very fashionable elderly man was now sipping his tea with aplomb.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why did you come to my White Mountain Sect?\u201dGrandpa Wu put down the cup of tea in his hand with some disgust, then looked up at the middle-aged man.\u00a0Hmm\u2026 this guy looks a little familiar, but I can\u2019t remember who he is.The middle-aged man\u2019s eyes widened at the moment Grandpa Wu raised his head. His hands and feet trembled as he shouted, \u201cAre you Elder Wu?\u201d\u201cYou know me?\u201d Grandpa Wu raised his eyebrows.\u201cOf course, I know you. 23 years ago, I followed my master and had the honor of meeting you once,\u201d the middle-aged man replied excitedly.\u201cIt\u2019s good if you know me. Where\u2019s Gu Rufeng?\u201d Grandpa Wu asked.\u201cMaster is in the backyard wing. I\u2019ll let someone go and ask him over,\u201d the middle-aged man replied. He turned around and asked someone to invite Gu Rufeng, while he himself asked another disciple to serve good tea and set up snacks for Grandpa Wu to enjoy.Shortly after, an old man with white hair donned in a purple robe walked in. His eyes widened when he saw Grandpa Wu: \u201cBrother Wu, I haven\u2019t seen you for more than 20 years. I trust you\u2019ve been well since we last met, hahahahaha\u2026\u201dGrandpa Wu held a cup of tea and looked askance at Gu Rufeng with special indifference, leaving him alone from laughing merrily to shrink into dry laughter, laughing at his embarrassment.\u201cCough\u2026\u201d When Gu Rufeng heard no response from Grandpa Wu, he could only resolve the embarrassment himself. \u201cWhy did Brother Wu suddenly think of finding me?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you the one who invited me here?\u201d Grandpa Wu said icily.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Gu Rufeng was surprised.\u201cBefore getting to work, let me ask you something,\u201d Elder Wu put down his tea cup and asked, \u201cDoes your White Mountain Sect have a disciple named Qi Changming?\u201d\u201cChangming?\u201d Gu Rufeng nodded and said, \u201cChangming is my last disciple. Although he is young, he has learned the handed-down teachings of my White Mountain Sect best. Has Brother Wu seen my disciple?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him, but my disciple has,\u201d Grandpa Wu replied.\u201cOh~~ Brother Wu, you also took in a disciple.\u201d Gu Rufeng was surprised.\u201cMy disciple also fought with your disciple.\u201d Grandpa Wu said, \u201cHowever, your disciple\u2019s cultivation is good, and he raised a Ghost King. My disciple is usually lazy and hates studying, and finally lost the fight.\u201d\u201cVictory and defeat is common in battles. My disciple only won by a fluke, only a fluke,\u201d Gu Rufeng\u2019s eyes were modest but couldn\u2019t hide the smugness deep within.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Grandpa Wu deciphered the smugness on Gu Rufeng\u2019s face and suddenly sneered, \u201cYou also know, I have no other shortcomings. I\u2019m just relatively protective of my people\u2019s shortcomings.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Gu Rufeng\u2019s expression drastically changed.\u00a0Protective???\u201cIf I beat your disciple, I\u2019m afraid that people will say I\u2019m an old man bullying the young, so I came to find you.\u201d Grandpa Wu looked relaxed, as if he was saying that the weather was good today.\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Rufeng stood up from his chair with a clatter, and said nervously, \u201cThat-that\u2026 Brother Wu, is there any misunderstanding between us?\u201d\u201cEven if there is a misunderstanding, so what? You see, I have come all the way here by plane just to find trouble with you.

If he were someone else, see if I don\u2019t release the Ghost King to kill him.\u201cI have a flight to catch in the morning, so let\u2019s make it quick.\u201d Elder Wu got up and said, \u201cI perceived when I came in just now that you have a total of three Ghost Kings enshrined here. I\u2019ll leave one for you. What do you think?\u201d\u201cWu Li, don\u2019t go too far. Do you really think I\u2019m afraid of you?\u201d Once Gu Rufeng heard that he wanted to destroy the Ghost Kings that had been worshipped by the White Mountain Sect for generations, he refused to give in.\u201cNot pretending to be polite anymore, huh?\u201d Grandpa Wu said contemptuously, \u201cYour White Mountain Sect are scums. Instead of cultivating techniques properly, you study the Soul Refining Formation all day long. From top to bottom, none of you are good fellows. In earlier years, there were many vengeful ghosts and malevolent ghosts in the world, but the world is currently at peace now, yet you actually let your disciples breed Ghost Kings. I think your lineage should be terminated.\u201d\u201cYou have given me no quarter,\u201d Gu Rufeng roared and performed a hand seal. Immediately after, the brightly lit hall became pitch dark, followed by three gloomy Yin winds attacking from the rear.Grandpa Wu unzipped his backpack, pulled out the peach wooden sword and talismans inside, stepped on the chair and jumped out. He dodged the attack of a Ghost King, and with a flip, he pasted a soul charm on him. He followed up with a thrust of his peach wooden sword, stabbing the Ghost King right in the heart.\u201cSoul Break!\u201d With Grandpa Wu\u2019s clear cry, a complex spiritual pattern appeared on the chest of the Ghost King where the peach wooden sword plunged, like an array. The Ghost King quickly turned into ashes and disappeared along with the spiritual brightness.Gu Rufeng\u2019s face changed drastically when he saw this. He altered his hand\u2019s magic trick, trying to make the other two Ghost Kings withdraw.\u201cDo you want to escape?\u201d Grandpa Wu coldly snorted. The peach wooden sword in his hand flew out, and his right hand waved towards his hiking backpack. A Soul Restraining Talisman flew out from his backpack and stuck itself behind the Ghost King the moment the peach wooden sword pierced him.\u201cBreak!\u201dAfter a shrill scream, the second Ghost King turned into ashes in an instant. Only then did Grandpa Wu retrieve his peach wooden sword and stopped paying attention to the last Ghost King who retreated.\u201cWu Li, you righteously said that my White Mountain Sect\u2019s breeding of Ghost Kings isn\u2019t a good thing, so what is \u2018good thing\u2019 are you?\u201d Gu Rufeng\u2019s eyes were red with anger, his face distorted. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember why you bowed out after a long career 20 years ago?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you want the last Ghost King anymore?\u201d Grandpa Wu squinted threateningly.\u201c\u2026\u201d How could Gu Rufeng still dare to scream? He was just too consumed by anger just now and lost his reason. He hadn\u2019t seen this old guy for more than 20 years, yet he was still strong. A person and a sword who could literally one-shot a Ghost King.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he reached the door, he suddenly turned around again, making Gu Rufeng almost stumble and fall from fright.\u201cI heard that you have changed to selling Peace Talismans.\u201d Grandpa Wu suddenly spoke.\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Rufeng didn\u2019t know why Elder Wu suddenly mentioned this.\u00a0Is selling Peace Talismans also forbidden?\u201cGive me two,\u201d Grandpa Wu said quite frankly. That tone of intimacy hinted at years of being friends. The fact that he just killed his two Ghost Kings was absolutely nonexistent.After Elder Wu took two Peace Talismans and left, Gu Rufeng just wanted to curse at the door:\u00a0I have never seen such a brazen person.Imperial Capital University, at the entrance of the girls\u2019 dormitory.Winter break began today, so after having dinner with her roommates, Chen Yu packed her things to go home. The moment she got out of the dormitory entrance, she met two handsome guys, waiting there.\u201cQin Yi, Shao Hui?\u201d Although Qin Yi and Shao Hui were in their sophomore year, they were busy outside of the campus most of the time, apart from attending classes at school. She heard that they opened a company together in partnership with someone else, so Chen Yu rarely saw them at school. Hence, suddenly seeing them suddenly this time, standing together at the entrance of the girls\u2019 dormitory surprised her a bit. She asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201d Qin Yi, who had always been a man of few words, was the first to speak up and answer.\u201cDid my brother ask you guys to take me home?\u201d Chen Yu guessed.\u201cShishi, let\u2019s talk in the car.\u201d Shao Hui also lacked his usual relaxed smile.Chen Yu was a bit puzzled. She blinked and sat in the car with her bag on her back. Qin Yi drove quietly in front, but the direction they were going was obviously not the military compound.Chen Yu noticed, but did not ask aloud. After a moment of silence, Shao Hui, who was sitting at the back seat with Chen Yu suddenly spoke and asked, \u201cShishi, are you a Celestial Master?\u201d\u201c?!\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.\u201cZhang Wenwen and Chu Xiao said you can see ghosts.\u201d\u201cShishi, can you really see ghosts?\u201d Shao Hui looked at Chen Yu expectantly.\u201cYes.\u201d Chen Yu simply nodded. Since Zhang Wenwen and Chu Xiao had already told them, there was no need for her to continue concealing the fact. Besides, the reality was she was just too lazy to reveal it and wasn\u2019t deliberately hiding it.Shao Hui excitedly grabbed Chen Yu\u2019s arm: \u201cZhang Wenwen also said you\u2019re much more powerful than the average Celestial Master.\u201dZhang Wenwen even advertised her? Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but be a little surprised.Chen Yu replied in a low-key manner, \u201cI\u2019m not good enough to compare with the top masters, but I\u2019m better than those at the bottom feeders.\u201d\u201cAnyway, you must come with us to see something first,\u201d After Shao Hui finished, he turned his head to Qin Yi who was driving and excitedly exclaimed, \u201cQin Yi, drive faster.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be there soon,\u201d Qin Yi replied.Chen Yu curiously looked out the window. The car passed an intersection, turned right and entered a hospital.Just then, Shao Hui\u2019s phone suddenly rang. Shao Hui answered it, only to hear Zhang Wenwen\u2019s shrieking, \u201cBrother Shao Hui, come quickly. My brother is dying.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re downstairs.\u201d Shao Hui\u2019s face instantly turned ugly.Qin Yi, who was planning to look for a parking space, directly turned the steering wheel and drove the car below the inpatient department: \u201cTake Shishi up first.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Shao Hui said, pulling Chen Yu directly from his side down the car.Chen Yu, who was forcibly pulled out of the car, actually wanted to say, \u2018wouldn\u2019t it be faster if you let me go and let me get out of the car on the other side?\u2019 yet apparently Shao Hui was currently panicking and was oblivious to this.He dragged the dumbfounded Chen Yu all the way to the inpatient department, took the elevator to the 16th floor of the department, and after exiting the elevator, continued to drag Chen Yu along, running wildly and finally stopping at the door of a VIP ward.\u201cChen Yu!\u201d The moment Zhang Wenwen saw Chen Yu, she looked both surprised and scared at the same time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chen Yu first looked up at Zhang Wenwen, then her eyes fell on a middle-aged Daoist priest wearing a Daoist robe in front of the hospital bed. The middle-aged Daoist priest was clutching a jade pendant with sufficient spiritual qi, channeling the spiritual qi from the jade pendant into the young man on the sickbed.\u201cZiyang, how is Ziyang?\u201d Shao Hui squeezed through the crowd and ran to the front of the hospital bed.\u201cChen Yu, please save my brother.\u201d When Zhang Wenwen saw Chen Yu standing in the doorway without moving, she eagerly ran over and pleaded.It was the first time Chen Yu saw her crying and begging. She pulled her hand back hard, but Zhang Wenwen thought she was going to shake herself off, so she grabbed tighter.Shao Hui also reacted at this time. He turned his head towards Chen Yu and called, \u201cShishi, can you quickly come over and check?\u201d\u201cLet go!\u201d Chen Yu shouted with a head full of black lines at Zhang Wenwen who was hanging onto her arm.\u201cChen Yu, it was all my fault before. I shouldn\u2019t have said bad things about you. I\u2019m so sorry. Please, save my brother.\u201d Zhang Wenwen\u2019s eyes were swollen from crying. She was obviously really worried about this brother of hers.\u201cYou\u2019re restraining me, so how can I even get closer to him?\u201d Chen Yu retorted while baffled.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Zhang Wenwen froze for a moment, then as if she was shocked by electricity, she hurriedly released her hand.Chen Yu then walked closer towards the hospital bed. Mother Zhang, Chu Xiao, and Shao Hui were surrounding the bed, but they stepped back at the same time and looked at Chen Yu with hopeful expressions.Chen Yu glanced at the young man in the hospital bed. He looked like Zhang Wenwen, but his skin color was pale and almost transparent. Maybe it was because he was in bed for a long time, so his cheeks looked particularly gaunt. He was sleeping quietly, but the vitality in his body was fading away little by little.His vitality that was mixed with the spiritual power input by the middle-aged Daoist priest flowed into a black hole the size of a table tennis ball in the middle of the young man\u2019s eyebrows. If the middle-aged Daoist priest hadn\u2019t continuously injected his spiritual power, the young man\u2019s vitaliy would have been cut off long ago.\u201cNgh!\u201d The middle-aged Daoist priest suddenly grunted with strain. His sweaty forehead and cramped hands was enough to tell that he could not sustain for much longer.\u201cDaoist Zhao!\u201d Mother Zhang looked at him nervously.\u201cMrs. Zhang \u2026 poor Daoist\u2026I\u2019m afraid\u2026I can\u2019t hold out any longer.\u201d Daoist Zhao said with some strain.\u201cHold on a little longer!\u201d Chen Yu suddenly spoke up.From the moment Chen Yu entered the door, Daoist Zhao knew that Mrs. Zhang\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t lie. The little girl she said she knew was indeed a Celestial Master, and the spiritual power around her was stronger than his. It was just that Chen Yu made no move after entering the door. Daoist Zhao was absorbed in maintaining Zhang Ziyang\u2019s vitality, so he had no time to ask Chen Yu.Now that Chen Yu had actually taken the initiative to speak, Daoist Master Zhao heaved a sigh of relief and said, \u201cThree\u2026three minutes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Chen Yu pulled out the compass from her backpack as she spoke.She had previously absorbed a lot of evil qi in order to awaken the dormant evil spirit in Lou Ming\u2019s body, but although she had recovered a lot these days, she decided to borrow the aura stored in the compass for \u2018just-in-case-things-go-bad insurance\u2019 purposes.\u201cBzzzz!!!\u201dThe compass vibrated unhappily in Chen Yu\u2019s hand, as if to say,\u00a0Every time I just absorbed spirit qi, you would then drain me.\u201cBe good, and I\u2019ll let you sleep there at night,\u201d Chen Yu said soothingly.The compass went quiet. Chen Yu raised her hand and gently threw it. The compass rotated in the air and then stopped above Zhang Ziyang\u2019s head. A faint spiritual light sprinkled down, and shrouded the young man\u2019s entire head.Although the other people in the ward couldn\u2019t see the spiritual light, witnessing the dark compass floating in the air on its own, was already shocking enough. Shao Hui and Qin Yi, who just entered through the door, were also dumbstruck.Under the spiritual light, the black hole in Zhang Ziyang suddenly stopped absorbing vitality and instead absorbed spiritual qi from the compass.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She stretched out a finger, and using the spiritual power of the compass, she drew a talisman in between Zhang Ziyang\u2019s brow, sealing all the vitality of the young man in his body.After the last stroke,the talisman seal struck, and the black hole, originally the size of a table tennis ball, suddenly began to shrink and eventually shrunk into the size of a black dot suppressed under his brow by the talisman seal. Chen Yu raised her hand and withdrew the compass. Daoist Zhao also took advantage of the moment and stopped channeling spiritual qi. He staggered and fell into the chair behind him.\u201cHow is it?\u201d When Mother Zhang saw the two stop moving, she immediately asked worriedly.Daoist Zhao first glanced at Chen Yu, but Chen Yu was looking down, thinking of something, so he could only explain by himself, \u201cYoung Master Zhang\u2019s condition is under control for the time being, but too much of his vitality was sucked away before. I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d Mother Zhang urged apprehensively.\u201cI\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t be able to wake up,\u201d Daoist Zhao sighed.\u201cWhat do you mean he won\u2019t wake up? Is my son saved or not?\u201d Mother Zhang asked hysterically.She originally thought her son was suffering from an acute illness. The doctors were at their wits\u2019 end, but the Daoist priest her daughter had brought in told her that someone had ensnared her son using magic. Now that they managed to stabilize her son\u2019s condition, the Daoist priest next told her that her son might never wake up again. Mother Zhang was on the verge of collapse and could no longer control her emotions.\u201cMom, Mom, calm down.\u201d Zhang Wenwen hugged her mother soothingly.Qin Yi on the side suddenly spoke out and asked, \u201cIs there any other way to save him?\u201d\u201cUnless his vitality that was sucked away can be retrieved,\u201d Daoist Zhao glanced at Chen Yu and continued, \u201cBut this poor Daoist\u2019s cultivation level is too low to detect who exactly sucked away Young Master Zhang\u2019s vitality.\u201dQin Yi followed Daoist Zhao\u2019s gaze and looked at Chen Yu, who remained silent, and suddenly asked, \u201cShishi, do you have any way?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s head snapped up in startlement, confusion all over her face. It was obvious that she didn\u2019t hear Qin Yi\u2019s question clearly.\u201cDaoist Zhao said that the vitality that was sucked out of Ziyang had to be retrieved before he could fully recover. Do you have a way to retrieve his vitality?\u201d Qin Yi repeated.\u201cNo!\u201dChen Yu suddenly turned her head and looked at Zhang Ziyang\u2019s soul who had suddenly sat up from the hospital bed. The young man\u2019s eyes were pleading, and he kept shaking his head at Chen Yu.Sure enough, it was voluntary!Taking away a person\u2019s vitality was an evil technique that works against the heavens to begin with, so even if it was used successfully, it was impossible to suck out someone\u2019s vitality as smoothly as just now while going unhindered in the slightest.Thus, Chen Yu felt puzzled at that time, but now, it appeared that this young man indeed voluntarily let his vitality be absorbed, and it was he who gave his birth date as well as his blood essence to the other party.Chen Yu frowned and suddenly didn\u2019t know what to do. On the one hand, he volunteered to die and on the other hand, his relatives desperately tried to stop him. A sense of irritability of being involved in someone else\u2019s domestic affairs suddenly welled up in her.\u201cShishi?\u201d Qin Yi prompted.Zhang Ziyang: \u201cDon\u2019t stop the Life Exchange Technique!\u201dZhang Wenwen: \u201cSister Chen Yu.\u201dZhang Ziyang: \u201cDon\u2019t hurt her!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d The noise was giving Chen Yu a headache. She carried her backpack, pushed everyone away, and directly walked out of the ward.She either killed all malevolent ghosts she had encountered before or helped them find peace. When things were too complicated, she needed to quietly consider how to solve the matter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhang Wenwen bit her lip, let go of Mother Zhang Zhang\u2019s mother, pushed the ward door and ran out after Chen Yu.\u201cChen Yu, Sister Chen Yu.\u201d Zhang Wenwen stopped Chen Yu who was about to leave at the entrance of the elevator. \u201cSister Chen Yu, please save my brother. What happened before was all my fault. I apologize to you, I will\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already forgotten the previous incident. Never ever mention it again.\u201d Chen Yu knew that Zhang Wenwen was referring to the young ghost who drowned before.\u201cIf you really forgive me, please save my brother, alright?\u201d Zhang Wenwen begged and almost knelt towards Chen Yu.\u201cWenwen!\u201d Chu Xiao chased out and saw that Zhang Wenwen was almost going to kneel. She promptly ran and held her up.Seeing that Chu Xiao stopped Zhang Wenwen, Chen Yu, who was about to reach out to stop her, silently withdrew her hand.\u201cSister Chen Yu, although Wenwen admittedly was at fault in the previous incident, the entirety of the blame cannot be placed on her alone. If you didn\u2019t remind her that a ghost was clinging on her, she would have been unlikely to seek a Celestial Master in fear,\u201d Chu Xiao couldn\u2019t help but say.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yu fell silent for a while. In fact, she knew that Chu Xiao was right. At the outset, if she hadn\u2019t deliberately wanted to scare Zhang Wenwen, that little ghost would have gone to reincarnation, and the subsequent events wouldn\u2019t have happened.The reason she was so angry when she saw Zhang Wenwen was because the little ghost covered Zhang Wenwen\u2019s mouth with his hand. The soul of someone who had just died was extremely weak. If it wasn\u2019t for too much fear or resentment, the little ghost would have been powerless to control Zhang Wenwen. So, Zhang Wenwen probably first wanted to find someone to help the little ghost find peace, but in the end she must have changed her mind and began to find someone to collect the little ghost. When the little ghost realized the danger, he instinctively covered Zhang Wenwen\u2019s mouth so that she couldn\u2019t speak.They really should clear this thing up. She and Zhang Wenwen were both at fault. Hence, Chen Yu helped the little ghost sought eternal peace as a form of apology and asked Zhang Wenwen to donate to children in the mountains in honor of the kid. This was to accumulate karmic rewards so that the kid could reincarnate as a good baby in the future.But in the end, Zhang Wenwen\u2019s crime was related to her. Chen Yu looked at Zhang Wenwen and said, \u201cGo there with me.\u201dZhang Wenwen froze, then followed Chen Yu to a corner.Chen Yu glanced at Shao Hui and Qin Yi, who chased after them, and then at Chu Xiao, who was standing nearby, and whispered to Zhang Wenwen beside her, \u201cIf your brother wants to die, are you still going to save him?\u201d\u201cWhat??\u201d Zhang Wenwen raised her head incredulously.\u201cThe reason your brother is like this is because someone took your brother\u2019s birth date and blood essence and used the Life Exchange Technique, which means that your brother\u2019s life span was exchanged to a person who is dying.\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cThis kind of technique isn\u2019t difficult to break. The actual difficult part is that your brother actually volunteered.\u201d\u201cWh-what does that mean? Why should my brother volunteer?\u201d Zhang Wenwen\u2019s face was full of confusion.\u201cTch!\u201d Chen Yu frowned, feeling that she couldn\u2019t convey this matter. With this in mind, Chen Yu brought together her right hand\u2019s index and middle fingers and slowly crossed them in front of Zhang Wenwen\u2019s eyes.Zhang Wenwen unconsciously blinked her eyes.\u201cYou can see your brother if you go back to the ward now,\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cHa?\u201d Zhang Wenwen was dumbfounded even further.\u201cYin Yang Eyes can only last for thirty minutes, so you better hurry,\u201d Chen Yu urged.Only then did Zhang Wenwen react. She turned around and ran towards the ward, rather dubious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shao Hui looked at Chen Yu and asked, \u201cShishi, what did you just say to Zhang Wenwen?\u201d\u201cThis is their family\u2019s privacy, so I can\u2019t tell you, or rather you can ask Zhang Wenwen herself,\u201d Chen Yu replied.Qin Yi and Shao Hui looked at each other, and Shao Hui continued to ask Chen Yu, \u201cThen\u2026Ziyang\u2019s situation, is there any help?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of whether he can be saved. It\u2019s a question of whether to save him or not,\u201d Chen Yu frowned and replied.\u201cWhat do you mean? Of course save him if he could be saved. What do you mean save him or not?\u201d Qin Yi asked, puzzled.Just then, a clamor suddenly erupted around the corner in the ward. Shao Hui and Qin Yi feared that something had happened inside, so they hurriedly ran back again.After they ran away, Chen Yu thought for a moment and sent a message to Shao Hui: (Tell Zhang Wenwen that my seal can last for seven days. If her brother has made a decision in seven days, come to me again.)After sending the message, Chen Yu turned around and left the ward through the elevator. Chen Yu was in a terrible mood throughout the whole journey, and her sullenness continued into the night. Even Lou Ming noticed it.\u201cIt\u2019s winter vacation. Why are you unhappy instead?\u201d Lou Ming asked strangely.\u201cI encountered a matter that I don\u2019t know how to solve,\u201d Chen Yu said with a frown.\u201cLet me hear it. I\u2019ll help you analyze.\u201d It was rare for Lou Ming to see the little girl weighed down by something in her mind, so he couldn\u2019t help but be a little curious.\u201cIt\u2019s just, I encountered a strange phenomenon today.\u201d Chen Yu did not say Zhang Wenwen\u2019s name, but made up a fictitious character, and then relayed the matter to Lou Ming, \u201cSo, Third Brother, do you think I should save this person or not?\u201d\u201cYou also said that the Life Exchange Technique is inherently against conventions, so the normal course of action should be to save this person,\u201d Lou Ming said.\u201cBut this person is willing to exchange his life for another person.\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cIn a way, the one he saved has a chance to continue living. If I step in to stop the Life Exchange Technique, then it\u2019s the same as me killing another person.\u201dLou Ming was slightly stunned: \u201cBut isn\u2019t this person already supposed to die?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s still different. If the other party is forcibly seizing, or maliciously snaring, then I can stop it without scruples and comply with Divine Principles. But the problem is, it\u2019s entirely consensual.\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cIt\u2019s like some car accidents. The child on the road was supposedly the one to be hit, but the mother on the roadside instinctively saved him. If I have a way to stop this incident, do you think I should stop the mother from saving her own child?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d This question immediately put Lou Ming into a dilemma too. This was a tragedy, and both endings were unpleasant.\u201cYou know, it would have been fine if I didn\u2019t see it, or if I lack the ability, and be helpless to do anything. But I saw it, and I also have the ability to stop it. Why do I feel now that I\u2019ll be involved with these two people no matter who dies, ah? It\u2019s so annoying, aahhh!\u201d Chen Yu rolled on the sofa while hugging a pillow, upset. \u201cActually, I can\u2019t quite understand his behavior. Won\u2019t he make his family very sad like this too?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When I catch a ghost, no matter how pathetic that ghost is, I will still take him away.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you know that sending them to reincarnation is the best ending for them.\u201d Lou Ming said, \u201cBut this matter is different. This person you\u2019re talking about is desperately trying to save another person, and deep down you actually don\u2019t want him to die, do you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yu froze and sat up hugging the pillow. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cIf there was a way to have the best of both worlds, would you go for it?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cBut there is no best of both worlds.\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cThe Life Exchange Technique can only be used on people who are going to die, so one of them must die.\u201d\u201cSince you can\u2019t leave this matter alone, why don\u2019t you just go and try to understand the matter at hand better?\u201d Lou Ming said, \u201cWhen you know more, maybe you will naturally know what needs to be done next.\u201d\u201cWhat if I still don\u2019t know what to do?\u201d Chen Yu asked.Lou Ming pondered over it and said, \u201cOr you can just think of it as for me. I\u2019m curious. What kind of relationship is it that allows that person to trade his life for the other person\u2019s life.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Chen Yu hesitated for a moment: \u201cBut my master\u2019s rule is that I must charge when undertaking a task.\u201dLou Ming snickered and said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll pay you a dollar to hire you to investigate this matter, okay?\u201d\u201cA dollar?

For the sake of our acquaintance, I\u2019ll give you a discount.\u201d Chen Yu threw the pillow, took the apple on the coffee table and began to nibble.Lou Ming could not help but smile again when he saw that Chen Yu had finally recovered her spirit.For a money-mad person to give him a discount and accept only a dollar, it was also considered that Chen Yu had attached utmost importance to him.Although Chen Yu wanted to figure out what happened to Zhang Ziyang, all of this was predicated on the premise that Zhang Wenwen and the others would seek her out again.But Chen Yu didn\u2019t know what happened. Since she left the hospital two days ago, Zhang Wenwen didn\u2019t look for her again, and neither did Qin Yi and Shao Hui. Chen Yu found it strange at first, but then thought that she was innocently implicated in this matter from the outset. She originally thought that since she saw it and couldn\u2019t resolutely leave them in the lurch, she might as well try it and see if there was a better solution.However, two days had now passed without any sudden movement from the other party. Chen Yu didn\u2019t have the character of a eunuch, dying of anxiety when the Emperor wasn\u2019t, so she wasn\u2019t bothered by it. She also thought that they might have found a more powerful Celestial Master, but not necessarily so.Hence, according to Chen Yu\u2019s previous plan, she happily ran on the road of receiving tasks from the metaphysics network and upgrading as soon as possible.After lunch that day, Master Mao appeared in the Lous\u2019 courtyard again with a bronze sword. Lou Ming was surprised to see Master Mao personally deliver the bronze sword: \u201cMaster Mao, why did you come in person?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But I must remind you that it\u2019s very dangerous to put this sword around you.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d When the evil spirit rioted violently in the research room last time, the Assistant Group together with Master Mao concealed everything. If the above knew that this sword would trigger the evil spirit, then this sword would definitely be strictly kept.\u201cIf something happens again this time, I won\u2019t help you hide it anymore,\u201d Master Mao said.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Lou Ming smiled, \u201cShishi has a magical weapon, so naturally she will be safer when catching ghosts. Besides, you also said that a malevolent ghost of the level of the Ghost King is rarely seen.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, the Luoshan Sect\u2019s ghost repelling technique is ranked among the top three in the metaphysical world. Although Little Friend Chen is very young, her cultivation is already high. With the Bronze Sword\u2019s protection, I think she won\u2019t encounter any more danger.\u201d This was also the reason Master Mao agreed to give the Bronze Sword to Chen Yu. It was only when Chen Yu was safe would Lou Ming not act rashly.\u201cBy the way\u2026\u201d Speaking of the Ghost King, Lou Ming suddenly remembered Qi Changming. \u201cHas the Celestial Master who manipulated the Ghost King before been caught?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Master Mao couldn\u2019t help but smile when he brought this up, \u201cThat Qi Changming is very powerful in escaping. The Six Teams hunted him for five days, but still let him escape back to the White Mountain.\u201dThe so-called Six Teams was an arrest team established by the metaphysical organization specifically to catch those bad Celestial Masters who used metaphysical methods to harm people. They were equivalent to the police in metaphysical circles.Lou Ming was surprised: \u201cHe fled back to White Mountain?\u201d\u201cThere is a White Mountain Sect in White Mountain, and Qi Changming is from there. The White Mountain Sect is a relatively isolated sect in the metaphysical world.\u201d Master Mao introduced, \u201cTheir founding ancestor was a bigoted Celestial Master. During the war period, he took advantage of the people\u2019s unhappiness and the world\u2019s deep grievances and refined a lot of malevolent ghosts, which later evolved into Ghost Kings after long periods.\u201d\u201cGhost Kings are very powerful, and ordinary Celestial Masters can\u2019t rival them easily, so the White Mountain Sect gradually flourished. Later, the war stopped. The world\u2019s grievances were no longer so deep, and many of the evil spirits returned to hell. Refining Ghost Kings also became increasingly difficult, so the White Mountain Sect gradually declined.\u201d Master Mao explained, \u201cThat Qi Changming is the current White Mountain Sect patriarch\u2019s last disciple. Because of his outstanding aptitude, plus his master likes him, his master passed on a Ghost King to him.\u201d\u201cPassing on one to him? That White Mountain Sect must have more than that Ghost King. So did he escape back to the White Mountain Sect to let his master shelter him?\u201d Lou Ming was puzzled. \u201cThen how did the Six Teams catch him later?\u201d\u201cWhen they first arrived in White Mountain, the leaders of the Six Teams also considered this problem. Although the White Mountain Sect has declined, it\u2019s impossible that they only have one Ghost King. When they were hesitating whether to go up the mountain to catch him, Gu Rufeng, the sect\u2019s patriarch, personally tied him up and sent him over,\u201d Master Mao narrated with another smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The White Mountain Sect had produced a disciple like Qi Changming, so he could be considered as an exceptional bamboo shoot out of evil shoots.\u201cNot really.\u201d Master Mao shook his head. \u201cThere are rumors that two days before Qi Changming ran back, someone came to the door and exterminated several Ghost Kings of the White Mountain Sect.\u00a0 The Sect was afraid of suffering a family extermination calamity, so they did not dare to shelter Qi Changming.\u201d\u201cWho is so powerful?\u201d Lou Ming wondered in amazement.\u201cI heard that the expert went there to avenge his disciple,\u201d Master Mao recalled.\u201cShishi\u2019s grandfather?\u201d Lou Ming instantly reacted.\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, only Qi Changming is the disciple of the White Mountain Sect who has practiced outside, and the only person in metaphysics that he has offended recently is Little Friend Chen.\u201d Master Mao\u2019s words almost confirmed Lou Ming\u2019s guess.\u201cI never thought Shishi\u2019s grandfather was so powerful,\u201d Lou Ming exclaimed.\u201cThat\u2019s why\u2026 you must meet Little Friend Chen\u2019s grandfather as soon as possible,\u201d Master Mao said, \u201cMaybe he really will have a cure.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Lou Ming nodded.Master Mao set his mind at ease when he saw Lou Ming\u2019s nod, then he fished out a bracelet made of three red ropes, with a coin-size jade piece pendant from his Daoist robe, and said, \u201cThis is the amulet that Little Friend Chen asked me to refine. Please pass it to her for me.\u201d\u201cShishi will be very happy to see it.\u201d Lou Ming smiled, \u201cThank you for your trouble.\u201dMaster Mao changed the subject and asked, \u201cHow are you feeling lately? Is there anything you don\u2019t feel comfortable with after we unsealed your Yin Yang Eye?\u201d\u201cEverything is quite normal, except that when I went to the National Academy of Sciences two days ago, I saw some ghosts on the road.\u201d Lou Ming laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s only then that I discovered how crowded the capital is at night.\u201dMaster Mao laughed. After chatting with Lou Ming for a while, he left the small building.After Master Mao left, Lou Ming planned to keep the amulet on the coffee table, but just as he raised his hand, he suddenly withdrew it again and summoned Tian Fei instead.Tian Fei found a box to put the amulet away, while saying, \u201cYoung Master, there was another call from the military factory just now.\u201d\u201cWhy? Did the prototype still fail to achieve the expected effect?\u201d In May this year, Lou Ming forwarded the design of one of his newly designed intelligent weapons to the military factory for them to mass produce. In order to produce this batch of weapons, the state invested particularly heavily. Against all expectations, when the first batch of prototypes came out, it was found that the weapons had a 10% possibility to spontaneously self-destruct.With such a big hidden danger, the state wouldn\u2019t distribute it to the army. After receiving the feedback, Lou Ming gave remote coaching multiple times, but the effect was still not obvious.\u201cYes, Section Chief Wang said he filmed the whole production process of the latest batch of weapons for you, and asked you to make some comments after watching it.\u201d Tian Fei said, \u201cI have the video file on the desktop computer in the study.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go watch it now.\u201d Before the weapon design was handed over to the military factory, Lou Ming himself had produced a prototype, and all the data of the weapon were very stable. He just didn\u2019t know why frequent problems occurred after it arrived at the military factory.For scientists, disregarding meal times and going without sleep to work was the norm, and Lou Ming was no exception. He carried on with the research late into the night. Chen Yu waited until everyone in the family fell asleep before running over through the window again, but he still did not leave the study.\u201cWhere is Third Brother?\u201d Chen Yu asked while handing Tian Fei the Evil Repelling Talisman she had drawn today.\u201cYoung Master is working in the study,\u201d Tian Fei replied as he took out the box under the coffee table and handed it to Chen Yu. \u201cYoung Master asked me to pass this on to you.\u201dChen Yu opened it curiously and found that it was a three spirit qi-filled Protective Talisman, and the aura on it was authentic Daoist healthy qi. It was much stronger than the Peace Talisman she had drawn herself. A happy smile immediately smeared Chen Yu\u2019s eyebrows: \u201cIt\u2019s an amulet that Master Mao made. Master Mao is indeed powerful.\u201dTian Fei smiled, turned around and was about to go and heat up dinner again, in case his Young Master was hungry and wanted to eat. Just as he turned around, a flicker suddenly flashed in his eyes. He turned back to Chen Yu and said politely, \u201cMiss Chen Yu, Young Master hasn\u2019t eaten dinner until now. I will go and heat up the food. Can you help me go upstairs and ask him to come down for dinner?\u201d\u201cThird Brother hasn\u2019t eaten dinner yet? Why didn\u2019t you guys call him earlier?\u201d Chen Yu said and stood up, \u201cQuickly go and heat it up. I\u2019ll go and call Third Brother down.\u201dAfter saying that, Chen Yu stomped upstairs in a jog.Tian Fei revealed a triumphant smile and quickly slipped to the kitchen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When I\u2019m not full, I can\u2019t even calculate what one plus one equals what, so how can you possibly do scientific research on an empty stomach?\u201d Chen Yu exaggerated.\u201cThat\u2019s exaggerating it.\u201d Lou Ming couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cCan\u2019t you even add one and one?\u201d\u201cAh \u2026 when I was in elementary school, I did not eat breakfast one time, and the math teacher asked me what\u2019s the sum of one and one. It took me a long time to calculate,\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you eat breakfast?\u201d Lou Ming asked curiously.\u201cI was still young, and just started the first grade. The mountain road to school is rough. While walking down the road, I accidentally tumbled halfway through, and the money that my grandpa gave me to buy breakfast dropped.\u201d Chen Yu recounted, \u201cSo, I had no money to buy buns.\u201dThis was the first time Lou Ming had heard Chen Yu talk about her childhood experience. Through Chen Yu\u2019s description, he seemed to picture a little girl crying sadly on the mountain road because she lost one Yuan. It was then that he suddenly understood why the little girl loved money so much.\u201cThird Brother, eat, ah.\u201d Seeing the dazed Lou Ming, Chen Yu could not help but remind him.\u201cOkay.\u201d Lou Ming picked up his bowl and chopsticks and slowly ate, while Chen Yu sat on the side admiring the amulet she had just received.\u201cMaster Mao is really powerful. This amulet is especially powerful, and is beautifully crafted.\u201d Chen Yu marveled. \u201cI\u2019m worried about how to carry such a large jade pendant on the body conveniently.\u201dThe ancients were fond of wearing jade accessories around their waists, so the jade pendants brought from the South were very big. However, modern people were no longer into this fashion. It would certainly not look good to have such a large piece of jade hanging around your neck. Therefore, Chen Yu specially selected several small jade pendants when she picked, just to make it convenient for her family to carry it with them. However, she obviously didn\u2019t expect Master Mao to also take into account the shape when helping her refine the amulets.Could it be that he thought breaking a jade pendant into several pieces could save a lot of jade material and allow him to make more amulets? After all, the power of the amulet would not be affected by the size of the jade pendant. The more Chen Yu thought about it, the more she thought that her guess was right. It turned out that Master Mao was also such an economical person.Lou Ming smiled faintly and never mentioned that he had found someone to polish the jade pendant in advance.\u201cBzz-bzz-bzz!\u201d Chen Yu was sitting, when the compass on her suddenly began to vibrate fiercely.At the same time, Chen Yu sensed a hostile intent. She turned her head to look, only to see Tian Fei slowly walking over holding a wooden box.\u201cAssistant Tian, what are you holding in your hand?\u201d That hostile intent was coming from the wooden box.\u201cThe Bronze Sword\u2026\u201d Barely did Tian Fei\u2019s words fall when the Bronze Sword in the box followed with a restless vibration, as if in response to Tian Fei. Tian Fei almost lost his grip, but after a startled jump, he tightly held the box in his arms.\u201cDon\u2019t you come any closer. Back up,\u201d Chen Yu ordered. She even retreated two meters away.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tian Fei also withdrew far back in fright.\u201cThis Bronze Sword is too vindictive. Why is it fiercer than before?\u201d Chen Yu said aggrievedly.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Sensing the fury of the Bronze Sword, Lou Ming asked in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s because I fought with it previously at the Research Institute, so it holds a grudge against me and wants to attack me every time it sees me.\u201d Chen Yu added, \u201cLast time, I borrowed it to cut a soul chain, and it cut my finger. This time, it\u2019s even more exaggerated. It\u2019s still several meters away, but it\u2019s actually bubbling with killing intent.\u201d\u201cWill the Bronze Sword attack you?\u201d Lou Ming questioned in surprise.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a particularly petty sword.\u201d Chen Yu said, walking a few steps toward Lou Ming. Just when Chen Yu was about to reach Lou Ming, the Bronze Sword, which had just been quieted down because of the distance, suddenly vibrated fiercely again.Tian Fei gripped the wooden box tightly in his arms, but the Bronze Sword was vibrating too fiercely, and Tian Fei was having some difficulty restraining it.Sensing that killing intent anew, Chen Yu dashed two meters away in retreat. In the instant Chen Yu backed away, the Bronze Sword immediately calmed down again.\u201cAssistant Tian, quickly carry it away. Don\u2019t let it fly out all of a sudden,\u201d Chen Yu just couldn\u2019t understand why this sword found her so disagreeable.\u201cOh \u2026 Oh.\u201d Tian Fei froze for a second. He was just about to carry it away when Lou Ming suddenly called him to a stop.\u201cHold on.\u201d Lou Ming stopped Tian Fei and strode toward the Bronze Sword. The closer he got, the more complicated Lou Ming\u2019s expression became. Lou Ming sharply felt the Bronze Sword\u2019s mood, which slowly changed from anger to joy.\u201cCackle-cackle-cackle\u2026\u201d Lou Ming approached it hesitantly, and the Bronze Sword happily hit the wooden box, as if greeting him.\u201cQuiet,\u201d Lou Ming ordered in a deep voice.\u201c\u2026\u201d The trembling wooden box instantly became silent.Chen Yu\u2019s mouth widened in surprise: \u201cIs it jealous that I took advantage of Third Brother?\u201dLou Ming stumbled and almost fell down.Translator\u2019s Thoughts :Hi, everybody.

Thank your for the Coffee (\u2229_\u2229)When Elder Wu first passed the forbidden technique to Chen Yu, he reminded her a hundred times not to use it casually if her cultivation level was insufficient. In light of Chen Yu\u2019s previous laziness in cultivation, Elder Wu was quite confident that this girl probably would never have the chance to use this forbidden technique. However, who would have thought that not long after she left the village, she had the guts to use the forbidden technique without permission?It was too dangerous to rob people from Yanwang, so he himself dared not use it casually. When he sensed that the forbidden technique was activated in the Internet caf\u00e9, he was so angry he itched to knock the head of his troublesome granddaughter with his long stem pipe.Two hours later, Elder Wu arrived at the airport from the Internet caf\u00e9. He figured the forbidden technique should be over, so he took out his phone and called Chen Yu again.As a result, one, two, three\u2026 there was always a busy tone on the other end of the phone.\u201cWicked girl, don\u2019t tell me she really encountered a mishap?\u201d Elder Wu frowned at a rare occasion.Ghost messengers couldn\u2019t take away the soul of a living at will, but under special circumstances where a person interferes with the Underworld\u2019s normal process, ghost messengers could capture the soul of a living to the Underworld. They\u2019d decided how to deal with him/her after interrogation and conviction.In other words, if Chen Yu\u2019s soul was captured by a ghost messenger, then within 24r hours, her body in the present world would fall into a coma. However, after 24 hours, the Underworld\u2019s verdict would come down. If her crime was more serious, her living soul would be stripped of its vital qi, then she would die.Elder Wu calculated the time. It would take about two hours to fly from the airport to the capital, and he traveled to the airport from the Internet cafe for about two hours. He still had 20 hours left. He intended to go to the capital to see Chen Yu\u2019s situation first. It was best if she was fine. If her soul was indeed hooked, he would have to run a trip to the Underworld. Although, he really didn\u2019t want to go to the Underworld again before his life came to an end.\u201cDear passengers, flight MU2066 to Beijing is delayed due to weather conditions. We advise passengers to be patient.\u201d An airport employee announced a flight delay without warning.\u201cFlight delay?\u201d\u201cI knew the flight would be delayed. Blame it on the bad weather today.\u201d\u201cSo when can we fly, ah?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s wait for the thunderstorm to pass. Hell knows when it will pass.\u201dHearing the voices of the passengers next to him, Elder Wu got up and walked to the glass window of the lounge. He looked up at the thick clouds, estimated the duration of the thunderstorm, and then resolutely walked to the bathroom in the airport lounge.Although Elder Wu was an exorcist and wasn\u2019t proficient at geomantic omen and divination, he could still figure out some general celestial phenomena. When observing the sky and clouds, Elder Wu estimated that the thunderstorm would take about 12 hours to pass. Even if the plane took off after 12 hours, there would be no time to bring Chen Yu back even if he found her.Elder Wu walked to the bathroom, looked for the innermost compartment, went in, and locked it.Since he couldn\u2019t contact Chen Yu, he\u2019d better go to the Underworld first to find out what was going on. If Chen Yu\u2019s soul wasn\u2019t there, then it didn\u2019t matter if he travelled to the capital later. If Chen Yu\u2019s soul was there, then he\u2019d better go early than late.After making up his mind, Elder Wu put down the toilet lid, simply sat on it, closed his eyes, and muttered a mantra silently. When his soul was separated from his body, Elder Wu\u2019s originally sitting upright body suddenly leaned weakly against the partition of the bathroom, looking lifeless.Elder Wu didn\u2019t dare to delay. He opened the Ghost Gate with his spiritual power and quickly went in. Although his soul wouldn\u2019t affect his body for a period of time, he was presently not at home, but at the airport. If the delay was long and ordinary people found his body, they would certainly mistakenly consider him a corpse. At that time, who knew whether they would call the police or send him to the hospital first?From the present world into the Underworld, every ghost would first reach the River of Forgetfulness, above the river was the famous Naihe Bridge. Only after crossing the Naihe Bridge and drinking Meng Po\u2019s soup\u00a0would they be eligible for reincarnation.However, at this time, the Underworld wasn\u2019t like the legends in the world of the living. There were many wandering souls everywhere. The construction of the Underworld was also much more prosperous than that in the world of the living. Wandering souls lived in lake-view apartments on the shores of the River of Forgetfulness. If they had nothing better to do, they could go out shopping, and the lucky ones could also meet their ancestors seven or eight generations removed. Together, they would talk about the family\u2019s legends in those years.\u201cHow come there are more houses than before?\u201d Elder Wu came to the Underworld once 30 years ago, when there weren\u2019t so many apartments and shopping malls along the River of Forgetfulness.\u201cHave you bought the latest civil service reference book?\u201d\u201cYeah. We must review carefully this time. If we can\u2019t get into the civil service again, we will be reincarnated.\u201d\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t want to reincarnate.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Elder Wu finally knew why there was an increase in the number of houses in the Underworld.Elder Wu went to the dead soul registry according to his memory and scanned the ghosts coming and going. When a certain propaganda reached his ears, his mouth immediately twitched.(Dear residents of the Underworld, the Underworld has now launched a rare animal reincarnation project. Every reincarnation into a rare animal can be exchanged for a rich second generation, a peerless woman, and a peerless man in the next life. You can choose from the three gift packages.)(If you survive long enough in the world of the living, you can get extra points if you want to take the civil service exam after death. Underworld residents, you\u2019re welcome to apply.)\u201cIf I fail the civil service exam again this year, I will go and choose a rare animal with a short life expectancy to be reincarnated.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m of the same mind. The one who was born as a Yangtze alligator before, ten points was added to his score, and he finally passed the exam.\u201d\u201c\u2026 \u201d The ghosts nowadays have such unique ideas.The so-called Dead Soul registry was actually a place where every ghost who entered the Underworld after death went to register. Dead souls should register, and so should living souls. Elder Wu had a clear plan in mind. He would first go and check if Chen Yu\u2019s name had been registered. That way, he could determine if Chen Yu had been brought to the Underworld. If not, then he could just turn around and head out of the Ghost Gate back. If she was in, then he\u2019d have to find a way to see if he could save her.River of Forgetfulness \u2013 the Styx river in Greek Mythology\u00a0Naihe Bridge \u2013 or can also be called the Bridge of Forgetfulness\u00a0Meng Po\u2019s soup/the Soup of Forgetfulness/Five-Flavored Tea of Forgetfulness. Meng Po is the Goddess of forgetfulness in Chinese mythology. The main ingredient of the soup is said to be all the tears the spirit cried on earth, both sad and happy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He only needed to check the records of living souls within these two hours to know if Chen Yu had been captured to the Underworld.It was just that a living soul was too conspicuous in the Underworld, so the moment Elder Wu entered, he cast a camouflage spell on himself to conceal himself. That way, he looked no different from a dead soul.There were seven windows in the registration office. Six of them were for dead souls, and only the rightmost window was for living souls. Compared to the busy level of the other windows, this one was incredibly idle. The ghost messengers inside were lazily leaning on their chairs and playing with their cell phones.\u201cHello, please, may I ask to see if my daughter is dead?\u201d An old man ran to the window and asked.\u201cElder Yang, why do you come to ask every day?\u201d the ghost messenger replied with a tone full of helplessness.\u201cI think she\u2019s almost dead,\u201d Elder Yang said.\u201cElder Yang, you shouldn\u2019t be too anxious. People would end up dead sooner or later.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid she won\u2019t die. I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t die until I\u2019m reincarnated. If that happens, there\u2019s no way I can beat her.\u201d\u201cI know she abused you when you were alive. This will naturally have a punishment system in the Underworld when she enters hell,\u201d the ghost messenger comforted.\u201cBut if I don\u2019t beat her myself, I don\u2019t want to open my eyes after reincarnation ah!\u201d Elder Yang said painfully. Who could understand the pain of dying without closing one\u2019s eyes and living without opening one\u2019s eyes?Elder Wu observed quietly on one side for half an hour, and only then carefully walked forward.\u201cHello, I want to register,\u201d Elder Wu said.As soon as the registration officer at the living soul window looked up, Elder Wu immediately withdrew the camouflage spell on himself.\u201cName.\u201d To make sure that he was a living soul, the ghost messenger then put down the phone in his hand and lazily turned on the computer.\u201cZhang Hu,\u201d Elder Wu made up a random name.\u201cHow did you enter the Underworld?\u201d the ghost messenger asked.\u201cI\u2019m a Celestial Master. I came to the Underworld to ask the Black and White Impermanence something,\u201d Elder Wu answered.\u201cCelestial Master? There aren\u2019t many Celestial Masters these days who can enter the Underworld with their living souls,\u201d commented the ghost messenger while tapping on the computer for a while. Then, he frowned and asked, \u201cHow come your name can\u2019t be found in the system?\u201dThe Underworld\u2019s management of living souls was relatively lax because the reasons for the emergence of living souls in the Underworld were mainly divided into two categories. The first being the soul was mistakenly or accidentally hooked by the ghost messenger. Hence, the ghost messenger would naturally bring the living soul directly for registration. A living soul mistakenly brought into the Underworld radiated vital qi. With such a striking feature, a ghost messenger would discover it and bring the soul to register.The second being the souls of Celestial Masters entering the Underworld. This situation was relatively rare. Moreover, the system of the Underworld had a registry for the Celestial Masterson earth. They just had to verify the name and then record it.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time in the Underworld. How could my name be in the system?\u201d Elder Wu feigned ignorance.\u201cYou are here for the first time, so you don\u2019t know. Our Underworld has records of you Celestial Master in the world of the living. Whether you have been here before or not, I will have the information here.\u201d The ghost messenger said and checked again, \u201cYour name\u2019s really not here.\u201d\u201cHow come? Let me see,\u201d Elder Wu said and stuck his head inside.The ghost messenger probably did not expect someone to impersonate a living soul, so without doubts, he directly turned the computer screen to him and said, \u201cLook, your name\u2019s not here.\u201d\u201cFreeze!\u201d Elder Wu took advantage of the ghost messenger\u2019s inattention and cast a freeze spell on him. The ghost messenger froze, unable to move.Elder Wu scanned the surroundings and found that the ghost messengers in other windows were very busy, and no one noticed their side. Hence, he leaned forward, grabbed the mouse in the ghost messenger\u2019s hand and clicked to view the registration record of today\u2019s souls in the computer.Thanks indeed to his stay in the Internet cafe for half a year. Otherwise, he probably wouldn\u2019t have known how to operate a computer. The last time he came, they obviously still recorded things in a notebook.Elder Wu scrolled down. Today, there were only two registered souls in the entire Underworld. Also, both were brought mistakenly into the Underworld. After registration, they were sent back. Chen Yu\u2019s name wasn\u2019t there.That wicked girl wasn\u2019t captured? Did she perhaps successfully perform the forbidden technique?\u00a0Elder Wu suddenly felt a sense of pride.\u00a0She\u2019s indeed worthy of being my apprentice.Elder Wu breathed a sigh of relief. Thinking that he had been in the Underworld for almost an hour, he decided to hurry back, lest he\u2019d be discovered in the washroom. By then, the police might be alerted.Elder Wu put the mouse back, raised his head to meet the horrified eyes of the ghost messenger he spellbound. He put the phone that the ghost messenger had just put down back into his hands, smiled and said, \u201cMy name is indeed not there. Continue playing on your phone\u201dElder Wu advised and walked towards the registration office door without looking back.The staff next to the living soul window turned his head and looked at his colleague next door. When he discovered him still playing on his phone, he bowed and continued working with envy deep inside. Who asked him to have no backing? Hence, no cushy job for him.When Elder Wu turned to leave the registration hall, he cast another blindfold spell to conceal his vital qi and was trying to walk towards the Ghost Gate when he ran into two acquaintances head-on.\u201cWu Li?\u201d Black Impermanence recognized Elder Wu at a glance. \u201cLao Bai, look. Is that Wu Li?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Elder Wu thought,\u00a0This is bad.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d White Impermanence swept a glance at Wu Li.Black Impermanence handed the soul he hooked back to his sidekick and asked him to take it in for registration, and the two of them, himself and White Impermanence, walked toward Elder Wu.Black Impermanence looked Elder Wu up and down and asked, \u201cYou\u2019re finally dead?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0I forgive you for failing to see through this old chap\u2019s recently researched camouflage technique.\u201cHave you registered?\u201d White Impermanence asked and moved to go through his phone.\u201cNot yet.\u201d Elder Wu promptly spoke to stop him.White Impermanence stopped from looking up his phone and stared at Wu Li in confusion.\u201cYou guys also know that I\u2026 was\u2026 ahahaha\u2026 young and frivolous in my youth.\u201d Wu Li laughed dryly.\u201cYou now know how to be afraid, that\u2019s why I told you to be restrained a bit from the very start,\u201d Black Impermanence quipped, \u201cPeople will all die. They must pay the price for everything they did before death after they die.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t I regretting them now? That\u2019s why I\u2019m wandering at the door.\u201d Wu Li was full of remorse.\u201cYou can\u2019t put it off forever.\u201d White Impermanence said, \u201cThis is the Underworld. If you become an unregistered resident, then you really can only be a wandering ghost for life.\u201d\u201cLet me delay it for now.\u201d Elder Wu was between tears and laughter.\u201cLook at you.\u201d Black Impermanence patted Elder Wu\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cWe brothers were just about to go for a drink after work, so we\u2019ll buy you a drink first and send you to the registry later.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0Frankly, I don\u2019t want to go. In fact, I can\u2019t go.No matter how reluctant Elder Wu was deep inside, he was eventually dragged to the bar by the Black and White Impermanence.\u201cFor the things you have committed before, you will definitely be sent to serve your sentence in the tenth level of hell when you are done registering. Come on, for the sake of our acquaintance, let\u2019s have enough to drink today.\u201d\u00a0Black Impermanence drinks (????)?? Geez.\u201cD-Don\u2019t be so polite.\u201d\u201cLao Bai, I\u2019ll buy the drinks. You\u2019ll sing later.\u201d Black Impermanence addressed White Impermanence on the side.\u201cDeal!\u201d White Impermanence nodded without objections.And also sing!!! Bloody hell\u2026Will I be in the crematorium or in the hospital once I wake up?Early the next morning.The airport cleaning staff was doing her rounds, she found that the last toilet cubicle door was locked. She knocked on the door, but no one answered. Feeling doubtful, she lay on the ground to take a peek inside and found a pair of human legs.\u201cAhhhhhhh\u2026 dead.\u201dSo the following morning, when Mother Chen returned the phone to Chen Yu, the first call Chen Yu received was from a city police station.\u201cHello, may I ask what is your relationship with old Mr. Wu Li?\u201d The police comrade asked.\u201cHe is my grandfather. Did something happen?\u201d Chen Yu was puzzled.\u201cMr. Wu Li was found dead in the bathroom of the airport this morning. It\u2019s suspected that it was an accidental sudden death. We\u2019re sorry for your loss.\u201d The police comrade said in a heavy voice, \u201cWe\u2019re asking the family to come and claim the corpse as soon as possible. Only after processing the formalities can he be sent for cremation.\u201d\u201cWait\u2026 Don\u2019t cremate him just yet, ah.\u201d Chen Yu was startled. \u201cMy grandfather won\u2019t die so easily.\u201d\u201cWe need the family members to go through the formalities before cremating him. However, if the family members have objections to the cause of death, we can also let the forensic medical examiner conduct an autopsy,\u201d the officer added.\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2026 He might not be dead yet.\u201d Chen Yu was almost scared to tears.Grandpa, ah, what are you up to, huh?!The author has something to say:Elder Wu: This isn\u2019t how I wanted to make an appearance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he received a call from her this morning with such frightening three words, he was scared into jolting up from his chair: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not me. It\u2019s my grandpa.\u201d Chen Yu hurriedly relayed the old man\u2019s matter, and then pleaded, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the police will really do something to my grandpa\u2019s body. Third Brother, can you find someone to pick my grandpa out of the police station for me first?\u201dAfter listening to the cause and effect of the incident, Lou Ming\u2019s mood also changed from fear to speechlessness. Listening to Chen Yu\u2019s soft pleading at the other end, Lou Ming agreed almost without thinking, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll have someone pick up Elder Wu now, and send him to the capital by helicopter.\u201d\u201cThank you, Third Brother. Then I\u2019ll hang up now. Quickly find someone to pick him up,\u201d Chen Yu said and was about to end the call.\u201c\u201dWait a minute,\u201d Lou Ming shouted to stop her.\u201cThird Brother?\u201d Chen Yu was puzzled.\u201cD-Do you feel better?\u201d Lou Ming asked with concern.\u201cI\u2019m much better. I\u2019ll be able to leave the hospital in a while,\u201d Chen Yu replied with a smile.\u201cGreat.\u201d Hearing the little girl\u2019s familiar laughter, Lou Ming\u2019s mood also improved some. \u201cThen say goodbye now. When we receive Elder Wu, I will contact you again.\u201d\u201cMhm!\u201dLou Ming hung up the phone, walked out of the study and instructed Cheng Peng to find someone to handle the matter.Thus, twenty minutes later, a team of heavily armed soldiers entered the police station in a certain city. They transferred Elder Wu out of the cadaver bag into a stretcher, and then carefully carried him away under the puzzled scrutiny of the police and forensics.Underworld, in a KTV.Elder Wu spent the night in a mood fluctuating from anxiety to crazy despair. There was no helping it, ah. The Black and White Impermanence detained him and refused to let go all night long. His physical body must have been discovered by now.\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Black Impermanence drank a little too much.\u201cIt\u2019s dawn,\u201d Elder Wu, who was closely watching the passage of time, replied.\u201cWu Li ah, you have to start adapting.\u201d Black Impermanence pointed at Elder Wu and said, \u201cThere is no day and night in hell, and that method of timing on earth doesn\u2019t work with us.\u201d\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve had too much to drink.\u201d White Impermanence gave his partner a disgusted look.\u201cIt\u2019s all because of happiness, you know? This guy is finally dead, hahaha\u2026\u201d Black Impermanence pointed to Elder Wu and burst out laughing.\u201c\u2026\u201d Elder Wu pursed his lips and restrained himself from losing his temper.White Impermanence looked at Elder Wu with some sympathy and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s time for you to register.\u201dElder Wu nodded helplessly on the surface, but in his heart, he secretly calculated his chances of escape from White Impermanence now that Black Impermanence was drunk.While estimating, Elder Wu followed behind Black and White Impermanence as they headed outside the KTV. He, who was trying to find a suitable time to slip away, suddenly heard a radio broadcast.\u201cAttention all ghosts. Attention all ghosts. A wanted notice is now issued. Yesterday, at three minutes past midnight, a Celestial Master impersonating Zhang Hu infiltrated the Underworld and injured a staff member of the Underworld registration office in full view of the public. He is now wanted by the whole Underworld government. This video shows his back that was captured on the registration hall security camera. If anyone sees a suspicious back or an unfamiliar living soul, please notify the nearest ghost messenger to apprehend him immediately.\u201d\u201cAttention all ghosts. Attention all ghosts. A wanted notice is now issued. Yesterday\u2026\u201dThe radio broadcast aired three times in a row. Elder Wu accidentally glanced at the big screen, and his face instantly turned green:\u00a0I\u2019ll be damned. The Underworld actually has surveillance, and\u2026When did I hurt the staff?\u201cSomeone\u2026actually broke into the Underworld?\u201d Black Impermanence turned his head and gave Elder Wu a look, and then said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe there\u2019s someone as bold as you\u2026\u201d\u201cYou should look at the person up there first.\u201d White Impermanence instructed Black Impermanence to look at the big screen on the mall wall.\u201cHmm??\u201d Black Impermanence turned his head to look at the big screen and recognized the wanted man at a glance, \u201c\u2026 Isn\u2019t this Wu\u2026\u201dElder Wu didn\u2019t wait for Black Impermanence to finish speaking and scurried out with a whoosh.White Impermanence had long been prepared. He hurled the soul hook chain in his hand without delay. Elder Wu flipped a few times in the air, and after dodging several attacks, he turned around and kicked the hook chain back.It was just that Elder Wu\u2019s camouflage cracked the moment he touched the soul hook chain.\u201cLiving soul!!!\u201d\u201cWow, there\u2019s a living soul here\u2026\u201d\u201cHis clothes are the same as the wanted man\u2026\u201d\u201cQuickly, call the ghost messengers\u2026\u201dElder Wu hurled an expletive and woefully fled through the throngs of ghosts.\u201cWu Li, give me your life!!!\u201d A loud shout erupted, and then a huge ox head suddenly appeared over the River of Forgetfulness.\u201cBrother Niu!\u201d Elder Wu was so scared when he saw the huge ox head in the sky and sprinted faster.\u201cBoom!\u201d A large axe head smashed down from the air. Elder Wu rolled on the ground, scurrying into a residential building. Niu Tou\u00a0raised his axe, wanting to chop-chop again.\u201cLao Niu, if you split this building, all your wages for the next five hundred years will be deducted.\u201d Ma Mian promptly stopped him.After hearing Ma Mian\u2019s warning, Niu Tou was even more angered, but he no longer dared to smash the building. He could only search for Wu Li\u2019s position in the dense pile of ghosts with a pair of ox\u2019s eyes. Whenever he found a chance, he axed him down.\u201cNiu Tou and Ma Mian, he still hasn\u2019t passed the River of Forgetfulness, yet you\u2019ve already used your primordial spirit to hunt him down. What bloody revenge this is!\u201d After watching the commotion for a long time, Black Impermanence could not help but remark.\u201cWhen Wu Li came to snatch someone back the last time, it seemed that Ma Mian and Niu Tou were the ones in charge of capturing his soul,\u201d White Impermanence reminded him.\u201cAnd then on that expedition, we took first place.\u201d\u201cThey were punished with five hundred years of wages.\u201dBlack and white Impermanence exchanged glances. Both put away the soul chains in their hands, and turned back to the KTV where they had vacated less than two minutes ago. Well, they thought they could sing for another hour.Elder Wu hugged his head and scurried, running to the Ghost Gate with all his might. \u201cBrother Niu, Brother Ma, I will burn joss paper for you every year\u2026\u201dMa Mian and Niu Tou weren\u2019t at all pleased as they swung their axes.\u201cI really had no choice last time, ah. I apologize, I apologize\u2026\u201d\u201cFirst let me throw you into an oil pan and fry you 500 times\u2026\u201dStone me\u2026\u00a0Elder Wu swore that he had never been so embarrassed in his life\u2026In a military helicopter flying to the capital, four heavily armed soldiers surrounded a stretcher. On the stretcher lay an old man with a ruddy complexion but not breathing.\u201cDo you think this man is dead or not?\u201d A soldier couldn\u2019t help but ask curiously.\u201cDead, right? He isn\u2019t even breathing,\u201d another man replied.\u201cLook at his complexion. It\u2019s better than all of us.\u201d\u201cWhy do you care so much? When we get to the capital later, he\u2019ll be none of our business after the direct handover.\u201dThe four soldiers were chatting when a \u2018waaah\u2019 suddenly sounded. The originally lying Elder Wu sat up in a swish.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Almost instinctively, four machine guns pointed at Elder Wu unanimously.Elder Wu raised his hands up once again.Could it be that he managed to escape from the Underworld after all the hardships, only to be sent back again?\u2026\u2026Niu Tou/Ox-Head and Ma Mian(Horse-Face)- the two guardians of the underworld in Chinese mythology.\u00a0Both have the bodies of men, but Niu Tou\u00a0 has the head of an ox while Ma Mian has the face of a horse.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Qi had been waiting on the tarmac with Chen Yu early on. When Chen Yu saw the plane land, she anxiously ran over. But before she could get close, Elder Wu had already gotten off the plane under the conflicting gazes of four soldiers.\u201cOld man, I knew you weren\u2019t dead.\u201d Chen Yu gave him a scolding while enumerating his mistakes, \u201cYou are so old, yet why are you playing fake death? Do you know that you almost got sent to the crematorium?\u201d\u201cWho do you think I did it for?\u201d First, he was chased and almost died in the Underworld, and then he woke up and was almost shot. Elder Wu was also nursing grievances. He smacked Chen Yu\u2019s head fiercely and scolded back, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you answer your phone when you\u2019re perfectly alright? You dare not answer my call, you dare not answer my call\u2026\u201d\u201cOw, ow\u2026\u201d Chen Yu wailed from Elder Wu\u2019s smacks.Ten minutes later, the two got into the car and drove all the way to the compound. On the way, Chen Yu carefully told her grandfather why she had to use the forbidden technique, and the repercussions caused after using it.\u201cYou can\u2019t use your spiritual power?\u201d Elder Wu frowned.\u201cYeah.\u201d Chen Yu added after thinking for a while, \u201cI can feel the spiritual power in my body, but as soon as I use it, my whole body hurts.\u201d\u201cServes you right!\u201d Elder Wu couldn\u2019t help but curse.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yu held back her temper, \u201cYou scolded me enough. Is there a solution or not, ah?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Elder Wu bluntly shook his head.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yu looked at Elder Wu incredulously.\u201cI warned you long ago. The forbidden technique can\u2019t be used indiscriminately.\u201d Elder Wu counted down, \u201cWithout that ability, what\u2019s the point of trying to be strong?\u201d\u201cEven you can\u2019t do anything about it?\u201d\u201cI have long told you that when recovering vital qi, evil qi will accumulate in the soul. This kind of evil qi that\u2019s accumulated from the inside out is different from the evil qi that stained or contaminated ghosts. Ordinary techniques can\u2019t purify it,\u201d Elder Wu said.\u201cThen can\u2019t I\u2026 exorcise ghosts anymore in the future?\u201d Chen Yu looked at Elder Wu pitifully.\u201cNot just in the future, it also depends on how far the evil qi in your body has accumulated. If the evil qi is too heavy, I reckon it can\u2019t be dissolved without you reincarnating several lifetimes,\u201d Elder Wu added.\u201cWill I also carry it through reincarnations?\u201d Chen Yu was shocked.\u201cOr else, what did you think? Is it that easy to steal people from Yanwang?\u201d Whenever Elder Wu called to mind that dangerous spectacle, he couldn\u2019t resist cursing again, \u201cFortunately, you\u2019re also familiar with the ghost messenger who was sent. If not, you\u2019d be dead by now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yu lowered her head in defeat. Elder Wu was her last hope. If even he said there was no way to recover her spiritual power, then she really couldn\u2019t be an exorcist anymore.\u201cYou didn\u2019t like exorcising ghosts in the first place. The timing is just right,\u201d Elder Wu comforted her.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s dejection worsened. She buried her head and picked at her fingers helplessly.Elder Wu felt quite uncomfortable too. However, she came out all right, so that was better than anything else.The car drove into the military compound and stopped at the entrance of the small Lou courtyard.\u201cMiss Chen Yu, Elder Wu, we\u2019re here.\u201d After parking the car, someone already came over to help the two open the car door.\u201cIs this your home in the capital?\u201d Elder Wu got out of the car and looked at the entrance of the small courtyard and quipped, \u201cNo wonder you have enough spiritual power to support the forbidden technique. It turned out that your home is built on a spiritual vein.\u201dElder Wu remarked familiarly and strode into the small courtyard, as if he was returning to his own home.Lou Ming was walking out from the hall, but just as he stepped out the door, he bumped into Elder Wu in the courtyard. He was first stunned, and then greeted him politely: \u201cYou must be Shishi\u2019s grandfather, Elder Wu, right? Hello, Elder Wu, I am Lou Ming.\u201dElder Wu\u2019s brows wrinkled. His gaze swept around Lou Ming\u2019s body, and then landed on the jade bracelet on his left wrist.\u201cThird Brother.\u201d Chen Yu also walked in at this time.\u201cShishi.\u201d Hearing Chen Yu\u2019s voice, Lou Ming\u2019s eyes lit up, and then he couldn\u2019t help but frown after noticing the little girl\u2019s low spirit. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Chen Yu pitifully tugged at Lou Ming\u2019s sleeve. She was about to tell\u00a0 him her grievances when her grandfather suddenly swept her to his side.Lou Ming froze and watched as Elder Wu dragged Chen Yu away, but he stood still.\u201cIs this not your home?\u201d Elder Wu asked.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had a trying time coming to the capital, so if you don\u2019t take me back to your own home, why are you taking me to a strange man\u2019s home?\u201d Elder Wu poked Chen Yu\u2019s head and scolded.\u201cHe\u2019s not a strange man,\u201d Chen Yu retorted\u201cNot\u2026\u201d Elder Wu froze for a moment and quickly recalled, \u201cYou told me you had your eye on a man. Is he the one?\u201dChen Yu blushed and nodded somewhat embarrassed.Elder Wu turned back and examined Lou Ming again, and then suggested to Chen Yu in a serious tone, \u201cGirl ah, why don\u2019t you change him?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThis one won\u2019t last long,\u201d Elder Wu replied in a whisper.\u201cGrandpa\u2026\u201d Chen Yu looked up suddenly and said anxiously, \u201cCan\u2019t you help him?\u201dElder Wu shook his head.\u201cI can\u2019t change him.\u201d Chen Yu said with a taut face, \u201cI\u2019ve kissed and slept with him.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Elder Wu smacked Chen Yu on the forehead again with anger.\u00a0This wicked girl, who did you learn these things from? You\u2019re driving this old man crazy.Chen Yu screamed in pain.Lou Ming heard the crisp slap on Chen Yu\u2019s forehead from a long distance away. He almost ran to her in distress.\u201cElder Wu, you must be tired after flying on the plane for such a long time. You\u2019d better get inside for a bite and rest,\u201d Lou Ming said aloud in a timely manner.Elder Wu looked back at Lou Ming, proudly raised his head, and walked leisurely to the house with his hands behind his back. He seemed to have forgotten that he had asked his granddaughter to change her man just now.Lou Ming motioned Cheng Peng with his eyes to follow and entertain him, while he himself walked up to Chen Yu. He looked down and saw that her forehead was red. He asked in distress, \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\u201cIt hurts!\u201d Chen Yu nodded, aggrieved.\u201cLet me see\u2026\u201d Lou Ming said and reached out to brush Chen Yu\u2019s bangs aside.\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Come here.\u201d Elder Wu stood at the entrance of the hall and shouted.Lou Ming\u2019s hand stiffened. He instantly straightened up and awkwardly took two steps backward.Since it was exactly lunch time, the three of them ate lunch together first. After lunch, Chen Yu pestered Elder Wu to help Lou Ming do a checkup. Although he just said he had no way to cure Lou Ming, Chen Yu had a hunch that even if he couldn\u2019t cure Lou Ming, he must know a way to extend Lou Ming\u2019s life span.After all, her own half a bucket of skill could seal Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit.Elder Wu narrowed his eyes but didn\u2019t talk. In the end, Lou Ming couldn\u2019t stand watching anymore. On the grounds that Elder Wu was tired, he arranged a room for him to rest.Because of Elder Wu\u2019s trip to the Underworld, his body\u2019s spiritual power consumption was also relatively large. Hearing that Lou Ming had arranged his room, he nonchalantly ran off to bed.His cheek on accepting benefits without working irked Chen Yu so much she wanted to pull his beard.\u201cDon\u2019t be angry.\u201d Elder Wu had been napping for half an hour, but Chen Yu was still sitting on the sofa in anger. Knowing that it was all for his own sake, Lou Ming was both touched and amused.\u201cThird Brother, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely let my grandfather help you,\u201d Chen Yu assured Lou Ming.\u201cIf Elder Wu had a way, he would not stand idly by.\u201d Although Lou Ming didn\u2019t hear what Chen Yu and her grandpa talked about in the yard, he noticed when Elder Wu looked at him and shook his head.\u201cHe didn\u2019t even check and said there was no way. I don\u2019t believe him.\u201d Chen Yu said, \u201cIf Grandpa can\u2019t solve the evil spirit on you, then at least let him help you seal the evil spirit. I can no longer use my spiritual power. If you don\u2019t take advantage of Grandpa\u2019s presence here and let him find a way, it will be hard to find him when he runs away.\u201dAs long as Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit was completely sealed so that it no longer riots, then his life span would naturally be extended. As long as his life span was extended, there would be more time for them to figure out what to do.\u201cYour spiritual power\u2026\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s miserable crying on the phone yesterday was quite vivid. Lou Ming asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell Elder Wu that you can no longer mobilize your spiritual power?\u201d\u201cI told him earlier. When I was recovering vital qi, I accumulated evil qi deep in my soul. Grandpa said that this kind of evil qi that\u2019s generated from the inside out can\u2019t be purified at all.\u201d When Chen Yu noticed Lou Ming\u2019s wrinkled brow and worry, she smiled and reassured him, \u201cI just can\u2019t use my spiritual power in the future. It actually has no effect on my body.\u201dLou Ming listened to Chen Yu\u2019s comforting words, but his ears were still ringing with her cries yesterday:\u201cThird Brother, it seems that I can\u2019t use my spiritual power anymore. Can I no longer exorcise ghosts ever again? Waaah\u2026\u201dElder Wu took a long nap, and no one dared to wake him up. Chen Yu and Lou Ming sat in the living room and chatted with each other. Gradually, Chen Yu also felt somewhat sleepy. She lay crookedly on the sofa and fell asleep.Lou Ming took the blanket handed over by his assistant, gently covered Chen Yu, and picked up the little girl\u2019s arm that hung outside of the sofa and stuffed it into the blanket.The moment Lou Ming was about to withdraw his hand, he suddenly stopped. He stiffened for a moment before moving his hand away from Chen Yu\u2019s arm, and then spreading it out in front of his eyes.Just now\u2026 He seemed to have felt a wisp of evil qi in Chen Yu. This feeling was the same as when he first touched the Bronze Sword and when he absorbed that zombie in Pingcheng recently. He felt as if he could absorb it.Can I absorb the evil qi from Chen Yu?With this conjecture, Lou Ming barely gave it a second thought as he reached out and grasped Chen Yu\u2019s arm again. He closed his eyes and felt the evil qi flowing in Chen Yu\u2019s body.Found it!\u2026\u2026On the second floor, the napping Elder Wu suddenly opened his eyes. He pushed the door open and jumped down from the second floor. At a speed where Cheng Peng couldn\u2019t react, he pulled Lou Ming pulled away from Chen Yu.\u201cElder Wu\u2026\u201d Lou Ming was astounded to see Elder Wu who suddenly appeared.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Elder Wu asked sternly.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Lou Ming thought Elder Wu had misunderstood and hurriedly explained, \u201cI-I\u2019m not doing anything. I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d\u201cThe reason you can\u2019t purify the evil spirit in your body is because it comes from your soul. Your current spirit is already extremely unstable. If you encounter a malevolent ghost with even a slightly higher cultivation, your evil spirit may be affected and riot. Yet, you dare to directly absorb the evil qi in Chen Yu\u2019s soul?\u201d Elder Wu asked.\u201cI just\u2026\u201d Lou Ming didn\u2019t think further at the time.\u201cDo you want to make that girl feel guilty for the rest of her life?\u201d Elder Wu asked again.Lou Ming was petrified and he shook his head vigorously. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026 I just wanted to\u2026\u201dLou Ming was halfway through his sentence when he felt a sudden change. He and Elder Wu turned their heads toward Chen Yu at the same time, only to see a wisp of red evil qi coming from the sleeping Chen Yu. The reddish evil qi was drifting towards Lou Ming\u2019s end.Seeing the disfavorable situation, Elder Wu immediately blocked Lou Ming in the front. He took out a talisman from his pocket, and collected the red evil qi.After making sure that there was no more excess of the evil qi, Elder Wu turned to look at Lou Ming in doubt: \u201cWhy are you still able to absorb evil qi even without contact?\u201dLou Ming shook his head blankly.Elder Wu narrowed his eyes, and a trace of doubt sprouted in his heart. Chen Yu only accumulated some external evil qi when retrieving vital qi, so this evil qi\u2026 It shouldn\u2019t be something so fiendish it turned into red evil qi, ah.The author has something to say:After failing to capture Elder Wu, Ma Mian and Niu Tou called Black and White Impermanence indignantly.Niu Tou and Ma Mian: You guys were clearly in the River of Forgetfulness yesterday. Why didn\u2019t you come to catch Wu Li?Black Impermanence: Lao Niu ah\u2026 when are you going to pay the 10 million joss paper you owe me?\u201cDududu\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was just about to stretch lazily, but inexplicably felt that her body was a little different. It was as if there was a lot of power flowing in her body. Chen Yu blinked and hesitantly mobilized the spirit qi in her body.After Lou Ming had made a move, Elder Wu was just about to put his piece down after pondering over it for a long time, when he suddenly heard his granddaughter\u2019s ghostly scream. He got so scared that he swept half of the chessboard.\u201cWhat are you screaming for? You\u2019ve messed up all the pieces,\u201d Elder Wu scolded in feigned annoyance.Lou Ming watched in silence as the chess game was ruined. However, his emotional intelligence was quite high as he didn\u2019t expose Elder Wu.\u201cGrandpa, Third Brother, my spiritual power is flowing again.\u201d Chen Yu excitedly bounced around on the sofa.\u201cI know. Stop jumping.\u201d Elder Wu was disgusted.Ignoring Elder Wu\u2019s snort, Chen Yu rushed to Lou Ming and said happily, \u201cThird Brother, my spiritual power can be used again, so I can still help you seal your evil spirit in the future.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Lou Ming looked at Chen Yu\u2019s cheerful appearance and unconsciously remembered Elder Wu\u2019s question to him just now.\u201cDo you know that if you absorbed the evil qi in Chen Yu\u2019s soul just now, you would have likely died,\u201d Elder Wu asked.Lou Ming didn\u2019t answer his question at the time. He knew that the evil spirit in his body was already very unstable. Master Mao also told him that he could last at most three to five years. But perhaps it was because of this clear time limit that Lou Ming tried to absorb the evil qi in Chen Yu\u2019s body just now without considering the consequences.However, despite pondering over them in advance\u2026 Lou Ming felt that he would have done so anyway. After all, he didn\u2019t have much time left, while Chen Yu\u2019s future was long.\u201cOld man, you still lied to me that you have no way,\u201d Chen Yu fiercely accused her unreliable grandfather. That caused her to be depressed all afternoon and fall asleep with difficulty.\u201cThat\u2019s your luck.\u201d Elder Wu glanced at Lou Ming without a trace.With a smile on his lips, Lou Ming nodded slightly toward Elder Wu, as if thanking him.Humph!\u00a0Elder Wu turned his head in disdain. Wu Li hated selfless fools who did good deeds without leaving their names the most. Had he not been afraid that his granddaughter would be ridden with guilt, would he carry this \u2018blame\u2019 for him?At dinner time, Chen Yu took Elder Wu back to her home.Knowing that Elder Wu had come to the capital, her parents waited at home early. Mother Chen even changed the furniture of the guest room, taking into account Elder Wu\u2019s status as a senior citizen. She arranged an acqua and mahogany retro decoration. At first glance, the room looked like where the world\u2019s experts lived.\u201cElder Wu, we have always wanted to thank you in person, but only got the chance now,\u201d Mother Chen said excitedly.\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to go to Damu Village in person to thank you face to face. I\u2019ve always been ashamed about this,\u201d Mayor Chen added.Mother and Father Chen were genuinely and sincerely grateful to Elder Wu. If he had only saved Shishi before, then he had also saved Chen Yang with the magic techniques he taught Shishi today. Elder Wu was the savior of their children, so Mother Chen and Father Chen couldn\u2019t express their gratitude to him in words.\u201cYou two don\u2019t need to be so polite.\u201d With a smile, Elder Wu took out two talismans from his backpack and handed them to Father and Mother Chen, one by one, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I came to visit and didn\u2019t bring any meeting gifts. This is an advanced Spirit-Repelling Talisman I drew. Take it. Ordinary malevolent ghosts won\u2019t dare to get close to you. If there are malevolent ghosts nearby, it can also emit a heat warning. It\u2019s very practical.\u201dAfter listening to his explanation, Mayor Chen was fine with his usual smile. However, Mother Chen\u2019s face gradually turned white. It was great that malevolent ghosts couldn\u2019t get near them, but the second function\u2026 Mother Chen didn\u2019t know if she was imagining it, but the Spirit-Repelling Talisman in her hand suddenly felt hot.Could it be that there was a malevolent ghost in their home, but she didn\u2019t know it?Considering Elder Wu\u2019s long journey (Mr. and Mrs. Chen did not know that the old man had already taken a nap in the Lou\u2019s compound), Father and Mother Chen did not continue to disturb him after dinner, and instead asked Chen Yu to take him to his room to rest.Chen Yu led Elder Wu to the guest room. When she saw the new furnishings in the room, she couldn\u2019t help sighing: \u201cMy mother actually changed all the furniture.\u201dOf course, Elder Wu also felt the respect the Chens had for him. But as someone who was accustomed to the various aspects of society, he didn\u2019t feel too discomfited about it. He took a sweeping glance at the indoor furnishings, the retro decoration of the room, and even the pen, ink, paper and inkstone on the mahogany desk.\u201cWhere\u2019s your room?\u201d Elder Wu asked casually as he withdrew his gaze.\u201cOver there.\u201d Chen Yu pointed to the rightmost room on the second floor.\u201cI\u2019ll go over and take a look,\u201d Elder Wu said.Chen Yu didn\u2019t doubt anything and led Elder Wu towards her room. She opened the door and presented it, \u201cI live here. My brother\u2019s room is next door, and my parents live on the first floor.\u201dThe grandpa nodded. After scanning the room, his eyes settled on the desk\u2026 on the two computers: \u201cWhy do you have two laptops?\u201d\u201cOne was already in the room. The other is a gaming laptop that my brother gave me,\u201d Chen Yu explained.Gaming laptop!!!Elder Wu walked forward and pretty naturally took the laptop that looked newer. He stared at what he believed was the gaming laptop and said expressionlessly, \u201cI\u2019ll use this one.\u201dMr. and Mrs. Chen considered a lot but failed to consider that the master might not like pen, ink, paper and inkstone, nor that he preferred to play games.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chen Yu opened the door and looked at her grandfather standing at the door in confusion.\u201cGirl ah, what\u2019s your Wi-Fi password?\u201d Elder Wu asked with a smile on his face.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe next morning, Mayor Chen went to work on the last day before the New Year, while Chen Yu accompanied Mother Chen to the hospital to see Chen Yang. Although Chen Yang was still in a coma, he was recovering well, and the doctor said that he would wake up in two days.Mother Chen breathed in relief and didn\u2019t let Chen Yu stay in the hospital much, considering that Elder Wu was home alone.Chen Yu still had in mind to let her grandpa find a way to solve Lou Ming\u2019s evil qi, so she didn\u2019t insist on it. After listening to the doctor\u2019s diagnosis of Chen Yang\u2019s condition with her mother, she returned home and pulled Elder Wu, who was still sleeping, up from the bed.\u201cIt\u2019s almost eleven o\u2019clock, and you\u2019re actually still sleeping.\u201d Chen Yu was shocked beyond belief.\u201cIt\u2019s due to old age. I just love to sleep,\u201d Elder Wu replied as he walked towards the bathroom.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0When have I not seen other old people?When leaving from the Lou courtyard yesterday, Elder Wu finally loosened up and promised Chen Yu that he would find a way to help Lou Ming.After Lou Ming tried to absorb Chen Yu\u2019s evil qi yesterday, he repeatedly asked Elder Wu to conceal the matter because he was afraid that Chen Yu would feel guilty once she got to know about it. Although Elder Wu took the \u2018blame\u2019 for the sake of his granddaughter, his heart still had some change of opinion about Lou Ming.Above all else\u2026 the evil qi from Chen Yu\u2019s soul abnormally leaked out on its own and flew towards Lou Ming. This baffled Elder Wu a bit. When evil qi flowed in the air, it would affect the people around, but it would never consciously move closer to a certain person.If this was the peculiarity of Lou Ming\u2019s physique, which automatically absorbed evil qi upon encounter, then Lou Ming wouldn\u2019t have lived until now. That being the case, the only explanation was\u2026 his granddaughter had some kind of connection with that kid.\u201cGrandpa, have you thought of a way?\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but speak out and urge when she noticed her grandpa, sitting on the sofa and looking at Lou Ming in a daze since they arrived.\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry?\u201d Elder Wu rolled his eyes at his granddaughter mercilessly before lazily asking Lou Ming, \u201cDoes your family have a lot of money?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Lou Ming was stunned for a moment, then recalled the rules of the Sect that Chen Yu had mentioned, so he quickly responded, \u201cNot bad.\u201d\u201cThen go buy a few magic weapons first. It will be better if they\u2019re spirit weapons,\u201d Elder Wu instructed.\u201cAre there any specific requirements?\u201d Lou Ming added.\u201cThe stronger the magic power and the older it is, the better.\u201d Elder Wu said, \u201cCome back to me when you find them.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Seeing that Elder Wu wasn\u2019t inclined to say more, he stopped asking further. He just nodded and accepted.Letting others follow commands without telling them the reason was how experts work. Chen Yu could tolerate Elder Wu treating others in this manner, but not when he was doing the same toward Lou Ming. So, she personally brought a cup of tea to him, smiled and asked, \u201cGrandpa, you want a magic weapon specifically for what?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d It was rare for Chen Yu to curry favor, so Elder Wu glanced at her and reservedly took a sip from the cup of tea, before saying, \u201cYour family\u2019s Third Brother\u2026\u201dChen Yu felt nothing wrong when he uttered \u2018your family\u2019s Third Brother\u2019, but Lou Ming blushed awkwardly. He averted his gaze and repeatedly admonished himself:\u00a0Elder Wu certainly did not mean anything else. He just said it casually. Lou Ming, stop thinking askew for your own sake.\u201cHis evil spirit emanates from the soul, which means that perhaps in his previous life, his soul was also stained with evil qi.\u201d Elder Wu said, \u201cI have taught you before. There are two kinds of evil qi in the world, one is purifiable, and the other isn\u2019t. Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit belongs to the one that can\u2019t be purified.\u201d\u201cIs there really no way at all?\u201d Chen Yu was even more flustered than Lou Ming, the person involved. \u201cIf it can\u2019t be purified, won\u2019t Third Brother have to carry the evil spirit at every reincarnation.\u201d\u201cListen to what Elder Wu has to say,\u201d Lou Ming spoke to calm the excited Chen Yu.Elder Wu glanced at the calm Lou Ming, raised his eyebrows, and inwardly praised, He\u2019s unruffled even facing death.In fact, Lou Ming didn\u2019t respond much to the thought that he would reincarnate with the evil spirit over and over. Elder Yan had already said it when he was in Pingcheng.\u201cTheoretically speaking, there\u2019s nothing in the world that absolutely cannot be done, and if there is, then either the strength isn\u2019t enough or the method hasn\u2019t been found,\u201d Elder Wu said.\u201cWhat method?\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cI haven\u2019t found it yet.\u201d Elder Wu sort of drawled the four words.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chen Yu held her breath in her chest. She felt that her grandpa was deliberately teasing her. In anger, she immediately moved to pull the old man\u2019s beard.Lou Ming also noticed that Elder Wu really liked to tease Chen Yu. In addition, Chen Yu was quite impetuous. A few words could ruffle her. He immediately held her down with a smile: \u201cShishi, don\u2019t get excited and listen to your grandpa finish.\u201dElder Wu looked at Chen Yu, whom Lou Ming calmed again, and continued, looking quite regretful, \u201cAt present, there is no way to purify the evil Qi in Lou Ming. Furthermore, even if I seal the evil spirit in him, it will not stop growing.\u201d\u201cBecause my evil spirit\u2026 wasn\u2019t formed by absorbing the evil qi from the outside, but is carried by my own soul,\u201d Lou Ming reacted immediately.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Elder Wu nodded. \u201cYour soul is like a huge container of streams of evil qi. The longer the time, the more evil qi overflows from the depths of your soul, and your body will gradually be unable to withstand it. That\u2019s also the reason you\u2019re going to live long.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 Sealing is no longer useful to you.\u201d\u00a0 Elder Wu continued, \u201cIf you want to prolong your life, we can only separate the evil spirit in your soul.\u201dSeparate?Lou Ming looked at Elder Wu incredulously.\u201cCan the evil spirit in his soul be extracted out?\u201d Chen Yu also heard this for the first time.\u201cTheoretically, it\u2019s possible\u2026\u201d said Elder Wu, \u201cThere have been records about it in our Luoshan Sect\u2019s ancient books, but no one has ever used it.\u201dElder Wu turned to Lou Ming and said in a serious tone, \u201cWhen I find an appropriate magic weapon, I will draw your soul and use a secret technique to separate the evil qi that will be overflowing in your soul, and then deposit it in the magic weapon. I don\u2019t know what will happen in this process. Your soul is different from ordinary people\u2019s soul. I can\u2019t even guarantee that I\u2019ll be able to send your soul back as it was after I drew it out.\u201d\u201cThat is to say\u2026 It\u2019s either a success or death?\u201d Lou Ming concluded.Elder Wu nodded:\u00a0So\u2026 are you still going to try?The author has something to say:One day, the Chen family received a courier.Mother Chen: What\u2019s this?Courier Brother: Mechanical keyboard, for playing games.Elder Wu: That girl, Chen Yu, actually started playing games! This is confiscated! (The laptop keyboard is quite inconvenient ah)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As the mayor\u2019s wife, Mother Chen usually didn\u2019t cook much, and she herself wasn\u2019t very fond of cooking. But every year at New Year\u2019s Eve, she would always personally cook the dinner.One was because the nanny aunt was home for the holidays. The other was that on days like the New Year, Mother Chen wanted everything in the family to be made by her own family.\u201cMom, will the dumplings fall off if I stuff them in like this?\u201d Chen Yu asked as she packed the sizzling dumplings.\u201cA bit will, but it won\u2019t be terrible,\u201d Mother Chen finished and reminded her, \u201cRemember to bring some vinegar too. Dumplings without vinegar will taste a little worse.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Chen Yu responded. After thinking for a moment, she asked, \u201cMom, can Brother eat these things now?\u201dChen Yang finally woke up two days before the New Year, and after another 24 hours of observation in the intensive care unit, he was finally transferred to a general ward. Although his condition had greatly improved, he still couldn\u2019t be discharged from the hospital in a short time. Mother Chen was afraid that his son would be lonely in the hospital for the New Year, so she prepared some dishes for the New Year\u2019s Eve family dinner and planned to go to the hospital to accompany Chen Yang to welcome the New Year.\u201cHe can\u2019t,\u201d Mother Chen said and packed up the braised pork she had just made.\u201cThen why are we still preparing so much?\u201d Chen Yu wondered.\u201cWe eat them ah. Your brother can watch,\u201d Mother Chen said with a smile.\u201cMom, are we going there to care for my brother or to stimulate him?\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but stammer.\u201cIt\u2019s just a formality. The point is that our family is eating New Year\u2019s Eve dinner together.\u201d Mother Chen reasoned. She looked at the second floor and said, \u201cOr you should stay at home with Elder Wu.\u201dMother Chen and Mayor Chen had to go to the hospital to spend the New Year\u2019s Eve with Chen Yang, but it would be asking too much to let Elder Wu accompany them. Hence, their reunion meal was scheduled for noon. At dinner, they\u2019d have to come home to accompany Elder Wu for another New Year\u2019s Eve dinner together. However, Mother Chen felt that it was quite impolite to leave a guest in the house while the host\u00a0 family headed out.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I talked to the old ma\u2026 Grandpa.\u201d Under her mother\u2019s disapproving gaze, Chen Yu changed her address. \u201cBesides\u2026 Grandpa never celebrates New Year\u2019s Eve. Back when I was in Damu Village, he used to take me out every New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d\u201cTake you out for what?\u201d Mother Chen asked curiously.\u201cTake me out to exorcise gho\u2026 Er\u2026 just something like that ah.\u201d Noticing that her mother instantly froze, Chen Yu hurriedly stopped the conversation.After saving Chen Yang in the hospital that day, Mr. and Mrs. Chen only asked why Chen Yu knew these spells, as well as made sure that the spell that saved Chen Yang would not cause any harm to Chen Yu. They didn\u2019t ask any more questions after that. They didn\u2019t ask, so Chen Yu also didn\u2019t say much. It was just that when they talked occasionally, they would no longer deliberately and sedulously avoid the topic as before.Especially after Elder Wu\u2019s arrival; he occasionally recounted the past and always mentioned exorcising.Whenever that happened, Father Chen remained calm, but Mother Chen was a bit scared. After one or two instances, Chen Yu slowly noticed it. Later, she restrained mentioning much about it in front of her mother.Mother Chen packed the last dish and closed the lid of the thermos.\u201cMom, give it to me. I\u2019ll take it to the car,\u201d Chen Yu said and took the thermos from her mother\u2019s hand. She turned and ran outside.Mother Chen watched her daughter\u2019s cheerful back as she jogged away, and a trace of chagrin flashed in her eyes. She was chagrined at her own cowardice. It was rare for Shishi to take the initiative to mention her past experience. How could she be so useless that she couldn\u2019t even control her fear even after listening?After everything was ready, Mayor Chen drove the three to the hospital. The family of four ate a simple and delicious New Year\u2019s Eve dinner in Chen Yang\u2019s single ward. Of course, Chen Yang, who just awakened not long ago, could only drink a mouthful of chicken soup.After eating, Chen Yu helped Mother Chen clean up the lunch boxes on the table together, and then the family sat down to chat. Mother Chen was holding a fruit knife and peeling apples for them.Chen Yu found it too troublesome, so she just grabbed an apple and directly gnawed on it -nom-nom-nom.\u201cI\u2019ll have it peeled in a minute,\u201d Mother Chen couldn\u2019t help but say.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Chen Yu smiled cheekily and continued to nibble on the apple in her hand.Chen Yang smiled despite himself and asked, \u201cI heard that Elder Wu came to Beijing?\u201d Chen Yang woke up only the day before yesterday. His mental state had been bad for the past two days and barely improved today.\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu nodded.\u201cThen Shishi\u2026 are you alright?\u201d Chen Yang asked.\u201cMe?\u201d Chen Yu blinked in confusion. \u201cWhat can happen to me?\u201d\u201cIf you were fine, Elder Wu wouldn\u2019t have come to the capital,\u201d Chen Yang said with certainty.Although Chen Yang had no memories of when his soul left his body, he himself knew best how his injuries were at that time. His parents also both mentioned about Chen Yu saving him. As a person who had witnessed Chen Yu\u2019s battle against a Ghost King, Chen Yang felt that his assumption was completely reasonable.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing\u2026 Grandpa came here just to celebrate the New Year. Didn\u2019t you guys always urge me to ask him to come here for the New Year?\u201d Chen Yu laughed it off, trying to muddle through it.\u201cShishi\u2026 Since you\u2019ve saved me, it makes no difference to say anything now. But at least you should let us know what happened to you in order to save me.\u201d Chen Yang said seriously, \u201cOtherwise, Mom, Dad and I can\u2019t be at ease.\u201dChen Yu was taken aback. She turned and looked around only to see that their father and mother, at some point, looked at her worriedly.\u201cAlthough\u2026 you keep saying that saving Yangyang has no effect on you, but\u2026 even if we don\u2019t understand metaphysics at all, we know that it is extremely difficult to bring the dead back to life,\u201d Mayor Chen remarked.In the past, no matter how they asked Chen Yu to pick Elder Wu up to the capital, Chen Yu always said she couldn\u2019t contact him. However, as soon as Chen Yu fainted, Elder Wu rushed to the capital the next day without being informed.It was such a coincidence. Even if Chen Yu insisted that her move that day completely had no impact on her, how could they believe her? They didn\u2019t pursue it, firstly because they didn\u2019t understand how the Metaphysical world worked. They were afraid that they might touch a taboo that shouldn\u2019t be known to the public. Secondly, Chen Yu obviously intended to conceal it, so they found it inconvenient to dig deeper.However, not asking didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t worried deep inside. Luckily, Elder Wu came just in time. He made them feel a lot more at ease.\u201cOn Zhang Ziyang\u2019s matter before, you told me that the price of reversing fate against the natural order is tremendous. Then, when you saved me\u2026\u201d\u201cNot the same, it\u2019s not the same. Your situation is different from Zhang Ziyang,\u201d Chen Yu quickly interrupted without waiting for Chen Yang to finish.\u201cWhere is it different?\u201d Chen Yang asked.\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Chen Yu didn\u2019t know how to explain Metaphysics to three ordinary people, so she once again attempted to muddle through. \u201cAiya, you guys won\u2019t understand it even if I say\u2026 Anyway, I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201dThe three of the Chen family looked at each other. Finally, Father Chen spoke, \u201cIf you really don\u2019t want to tell us, we don\u2019t have to know. Just\u2026 if something bad really happened to you, you must tell us.\u201d\u201cShishi, your dad and I are ordinary people, and we don\u2019t understand anything in your Metaphysical world. You don\u2019t know how worried we were after you passed out that day. If Elder Wu hadn\u2019t arrived the next day, we\u2026\u201d Mother Chen choked on her voice as she spoke, \u201cI only want you to live well. You and Yangyang are both my children. Nothing can happen to either of you.\u201dSeeing how Mother Chen was crying while talking again, Father Chen sighed and comforted his wife gently while wiping her tears.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d When Chen Yu saw her mother crying, she panicked: \u201cI\u2019m really fine, Mom. Don\u2019t cry. \u201cChen Yu deliberately concealed everything because she was most afraid that her mother would react like this.The more Chen Yu pacified her, the more Mother Chen imagined things, and so her cries turned sadder.\u201cAiya\u2026 I\u2019m really fine.\u201d Chen Yu was tangled for a long time before resigning to her fate. \u201cAlright, I admit it. Grandpa came to the capital indeed because of me.\u201dMother Chen immediately stopped crying, and the three people looked at Chen Yu in unison, listening to her attentively.\u201cAt that time, I used a forbidden technique when I saved Big Brother, and this technique had a certain backlash on me. That\u2019s why I suddenly fainted that day. Grandpa sensed that I had used the forbidden technique that day. He was afraid that I would suffer a backlash so he came here to find me, and then healed me,\u201d Chen Yu briefly explained the cause and effect.\u201cHealed you?\u201d Mother Chen still had some doubts.\u201cReally. If I wasn\u2019t cured, do you think the old man would be in the mood to lounge around in his room playing games all day?\u201d Thinking of that internet addicted old man, Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but want to castigate him, even forgetting to call him Grandpa.\u201c\u2026\u201d Mother Chen and Father Chen exchanged glances, and both saw the incredulity in each other\u2019s eyes. It turned out that Elder Wu was hiding in his room all day, not practicing making talismans, but playing games?\u201cSo you guys just rest assured. I\u2019m really fine,\u201d Chen Yu reiterated anew.\u201cThen you must not mess around again in the future,\u201d Mother Chen instructed uneasily.\u201cMom, why do you always talk about me? Why don\u2019t you talk about my brother. Had he carried his amulet properly, these things wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Chen Yu directly dumped the blame.The Chen couple immediately turned their attention and looked at a certain \u2018culprit\u2019.\u201cOuch\u2026 Why do I feel a little pain in my chest? I may need to rest for a while,\u201d Chen Yang said, lying down spontaneously, and covered himself with his quilt.\u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is there a special reason for this? Why do you have to go out to exorcise on New Year\u2019s Day?\u201d Mother Chen asked.\u201cBecause there are more ghosts on New Year\u2019s Eve than on ordinary days,\u201d Elder Wu replied.\u201cThere are more ghosts today\u2026 than on ordinary days?\u201d Mother Chen leaned toward her husband without a trace.\u201cYes. The ghosts wandering around outside tonight are about two or three times as many as on ordinary days, and most of them are malevolent ghosts,\u201d Elder Wu said while giving himself another chopstick of stir-fried meat.Mother Chen shuddered again and almost dropped her chopsticks in fright. Mayor Chen couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. He was just about to change the subject when his wife asked out loud again.\u201cWhy is that?\u201d Mother Chen was both scared and curious.\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Elder Wu was thinking of how to explain to show his profound image when a sudden sharp pain stung his foot.Elder Wu gritted his teeth in pain, turned his head and glared at his granddaughter. He asked wordlessly: Why did you step on me?Chen Yu just ignored him. She turned her head to soothe her mother, saying, \u201cMom, don\u2019t listen to Grandpa\u2019s nonsense. He\u2019s deliberately scaring you. New Year\u2019s Eve is actually a very good day because the Nian Beast will appear at midnight.\u201d\u201cIs there indeed a Nian Beast?\u201d Mother Chen was in shock.\u201cThere is,\u201d Chen Yu explained, \u201cThe legends say that the Nian Beast is a fierce beast, but in fact, it isn\u2019t. At this time of year, the Nian Beast will come to the world and devour all the bad things in the world. For example, evil tendencies, evil qi, murderous aura and so on\u2026 all evil stuff. It\u2019s said that because it swallowed lots of bad, the aura around it is more frightening. It also looks fierce and evil, so it\u2019s easily misunderstood, but in fact, it is purifying the earth.\u201d\u201cThen, not only is he not a fierce beast, but he is also an auspicious one.\u201d It was the first time that Mother Chen heard such an explanation.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Chen Yu nodded. \u201cThe Nian Beast is actually great.\u201d\u201cYou know a lot. Why don\u2019t you eat quickly and then rush out the door?\u201d Elder Wu \u2018remembered\u2019 Chen Yu stomping on his foot and took the opportunity to knock Chen Yu\u2019s head fiercely.Chen Yu grimaced in pain and used her hand to block her head, glaring back indignantly.But Elder Wu had already turned his head and was amiably answering Mother Chen\u2019s question.\u201cGo out? Where is she going?\u201d Mother Chen asked.\u201cTo exorcise,\u201d Elder Wu said.After listening for a long time,\u00a0 Father Chen vaguely figured out the logical relationship within: \u201cAre these bad things that the Nian Beast wants to devour useful things for malevolent ghosts? Is that why there are more malevolent ghosts today than usual? So when Shishi goes out to exorcise, she is, in fact, doing the Nian Beast a favor?\u201d\u201cI finally know where this girl inherited her IQ from. Mayor Chen, you\u2019re not involved in Metaphysics, yet you worked out the link with just a word or two. Awesome.\u201d Elder Wu couldn\u2019t help but nod in approval.\u201cYou flatter me, Elder Wu,\u201d Mayor Chen returned modestly.\u201cWill that be dangerous?\u201d Mother Chen couldn\u2019t help but worry when she heard her daughter was going out to exorcise ghosts.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. When she was eight years old, I let her go alone to exorcise on New Year\u2019s Eve. She will be fine.\u201dIt was just that right after Elder Wu spoke, Mother and Father Chen looked at him with entangled faces.\u201cDon\u2019t just watch me eat ah. Eat too. These glutinous rice ribs are really delicious,\u201d Elder Wu said and went to clip a serving.Although reason told the couple to respect the elderly, they really wanted to hit someone. What to do?Because of the talk about the Nian Beast at the New Year\u2019s Eve dinner, Chen Yu could finally go out to catch ghosts at night and return through the front door openly. However, she did not rush to the direction where the Nian Beast might appear this year. Instead, she first went to the small Lou courtyard.\u201cThird Brother.\u201d Chen Yu rushed all the way to the study on the second floor at a trot.When Lou Ming heard Chen Yu\u2019s footsteps, he put down the book he was holding in advance and waited until the door was pushed open with a bang before he smiled and asked, \u201cToday is New Year\u2019s Eve. Why aren\u2019t you at home?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going out to exorcise ghosts today,\u201d Chen Yu replied.\u201cExorcise ghosts?\u201d Lou Ming grew up around Master Mao, so he also learned some common knowledge in the metaphysical world. He only froze for a couple of seconds before responding, \u201cThe Nian Beast will appear tonight, so there will be more malevolent ghosts outside. Helping the Nian Beast dispel malevolent ghosts and let it devour more hostile aura is said to let Celestial Masters accumulate merit points.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, so I\u2019m going out soon to get rid of ghosts.\u201d Chen Yu nodded.\u201cSo did you come here to fetch some Evil Repelling Talismans?\u201d Lou Ming asked and turned around to get the box containing Evil Repelling Talismans on the bookshelf.\u201cNo, I came to\u2026\u201d Chen Yu paused. She suddenly walked around the desk and stood in front of Lou Ming, looking at him with desire to speak.\u201cTo do what?\u201d Lou Ming was puzzled.\u201cThird Brother\u2026 You\u2019re so tall, ah.\u201d Because Chen Yu was standing too close, she had to tilt her head high to look at Lou Ming.Lou Ming smothered a laugh: \u201cDid you just find out how tall I\u2019ve grown?\u201d\u201cThird Brother, please sit down.\u201d Chen Yu tugged on Lou Ming\u2019s sleeve.\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cThird Brother, sit down first.\u201d Chen Yu tugged Lou Ming again.Lou Ming was helpless. He smiled, sat back on the chair behind him and continued to ask, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t come here for the Evil Repelling Talismans, then what did you come here for?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Chen Yu\u2019s eyes wandered, and then with lightning speed, she captured Lou Ming\u2019s lips.Lou Ming almost jumped up from the chair in shock. He pushed her away and asked in alarm, \u201cShishi, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cAbsorbing the evil qi that is spilling out of your body, ah,\u201d Chen Yu replied in all innocence.\u201cThere\u2019s no need. The evil spirit in my body is quite stable now. There\u2019s no need to seal it.\u201d Lou Ming covered his thumping heart and refused.\u201cI\u2019m not sealing it. I am trying to absorb some of your evil qi before finding the Nian Beast,\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cAre you going to bring the evil qi from my body and then let the Nian Beast devour it?\u201d Lou Ming asked.\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s useless.\u201d Lou Ming shook his head and said, \u201cThe Nian Beast only devours the unowned evil qi floating in the air. It won\u2019t devour mine.\u201dMaster Mao tried to use this method a few years back. Unfortunately, the Nian Beast couldn\u2019t even devour the evil qi from lonely ghosts and malevolent ghosts, so how could it swallow his evil qi?\u201cWhen I absorb your evil qi, it will be contained in my body. This is superfluous in me, which is equivalent to being unowned. In this way, the Nian beast may devour it,\u201d Chen Yu argued, \u201cMoreover\u2026 The evil spirit in your body is already showing signs of instability. I guess I will need to seal it in another two days, so why don\u2019t I take this opportunity to help you relieve it in advance?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Lou Ming examined himself with uncertainty. Was his evil spirit really unstable?\u201cEn.\u201d Chen Yu nodded with remarkable sincerity.Lou Ming was so tangled that his eyebrows got wrinkled. He pursed his lips, momentarily indecisive.\u201cAhh, the Nian Beast will appear in a while. I must hurry,\u201d Chen Yu didn\u2019t give Lou Ming a chance to react and pounced again.Lou Ming tightly grasped the armrests of his chair. The back of his hands burst with blue veins,\u00a0 expressing his inner entanglement and struggle.After kissing for a while, Chen Yu slowly lifted her head. She opened her eyes and saw Lou Ming\u2019s complicated expression.Lou Ming averted his gaze guiltily. Just as he was about to get up to go and hide, Chen Yu pressed him back again.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Lou Ming asked in surprise.\u201cLet me absorb a little more,\u201d Chen Yu immediately lowered her head and kissed him again.Lou Ming felt torn and guilty. He was moved but at the same time at a loss. He was a jumble of emotions and didn\u2019t know what to do.Chen Yu is sacrificing so much to save you. How can you repay her, huh?Chen Yu had already absorbed enough evil qi when she kissed him the first time, but when they just separated, she suddenly remembered that morning in the suburbs, when she faced Lou Ming\u2019s eyes. That\u2026 It was Lou Ming who took the initiative to kiss her.Chen Yu recalled the action of that day and stretched her tongue out without warning.Huh??\u00a0Lou Ming\u2019s eyes instantly opened wide. He was so shocked his soul almost took flight.The author has something to say:Father and Mother Chen: Elder Wu, you\u2019ve taught Shishi very well.Elder Wu was proud: That\u2019s for sure. She can catch ghosts at the age of eight, catch hopping vampires at the age of ten, and go out alone at the age of fifteen to catch ghosts to buy me cigarettes.Father and Mother Chen: \u2026 (I really want to call the police)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His phone suddenly rang in the empty study. It was a video call from his mother, but Lou Ming did not seem to hear it.He was slumped in his chair with his mouth still seemingly tingling with the sensation of Chen Yu\u2019s tongue licking through. Every time he recalled it, he felt drained of energy.Miss, you\u2019re playing with fire. Did you know that?Lou Ming couldn\u2019t bear to close his eyes. His heart thumped violently in his paralyzed body, and it seemed that every pump was urging him to do something he had been trying to stop himself from doing.\u201cKnock, knock!\u201dHe Qi knocked at the door and waited for a while without hearing Lou Ming reply. He frowned slightly in doubt. He knocked on the door again after a while, and then Lou Ming let him in.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d He Qi pushed the door and entered.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lou Ming maintained the same position as before without moving, without even turning his head to look at He Qi.\u201cMadam just called you, but you didn\u2019t answer,\u201d He Qi said.Lou Ming was stunned. He reached for the mobile phone on the table and found that there were two missed calls from his mother. He\u2019d been sitting for a long time, but didn\u2019t hear it.\u201cI know, go out.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter He Qi left, Lou Ming adjusted his emotions, and only then began to call Madam Lou back.Chen Yu ran happily in the streets of the capital with a body brimming with evil qi. If someone with opened Yin Yang eyes were to look at this time, he would have seen a bouncing female hopping vampire in the distance, oozing with suffocating bloody red evil qi.The Nian Beast would appear at 11 p.m to 1 a.m., which meant the transition period from the old to the new. It would turn into countless clones and disperse into the world, devouring the world\u2019s filthy aura. On ordinary days, these filthy auras were scattered in the air, and people couldn\u2019t feel them at all. However, at the hour the Nian Beast appeared, these filthy auras, which were extremely weak on ordinary days, would continue to gather like snowballs, roll bigger and bigger, and finally gather in front of the Nian Beast to be swallowed.But in the period these foul aura reached the Nian Beast, these small clusters of foul qi amassed in the air were a great tonic for the malevolent ghosts.Therefore, after New Year\u2019s Eve every year, while the New Year was in full swing, it was also accompanied by the growth of some malevolent ghosts. So much so that during every New Year\u2019s Eve, the Metaphysics Network would conduct major exorcisms. Chen Yu calculated. One malevolent ghost was equivalent to a point. Although there was no charge for exorcising ghosts today, if she caught a hundred of them, she could be promoted to Class A and would be qualified to take on millions-worth of tasks.Thinking of the A-level quests hanging on the Metaphysics Network that she could see but couldn\u2019t accept, Chen Yu suddenly became bottomlessly proud. Today, no one could stop her from leveling up.Chen Yu clenched her fists and reached out to stop a cab and headed for the suburbs. It was because the places where the Nian Beast clones appeared were mostly sparsely populated mountains and forests. The filthy aura would move in the process of condensation. Most of the formed evil aura masses would be scattered within five miles around the Nian Beast, so most malevolent ghosts gathered there.Therefore\u2026 it was a wise choice to celebrate the New Year at home during the New Year\u2019s eve, because it was easy to run into ghosts if you wandered around on this day.Behind the cab in which Chen Yu was riding, a small black car followed closely behind.Today was New Year\u2019s Eve, and considering that there would be too many malevolent ghosts outside, Lou Ming especially sent two assistants to follow Chen Yu with Evil Repelling Talismans in fear that she\u2019d have an accident.\u201cI really can\u2019t figure it out,\u201d Cheng Peng remarked while following the taxi in front of him.\u201cCan\u2019t figure out what?\u201d Tian Fei asked while giving He Qi a report on Chen Yu\u2019s whereabouts.\u201cIf Young Master wants to protect Miss Chen Yu, why do we have to sneak around?\u201d Cheng Peng had been chewing over this question. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if they protected her close if their Young Master wanted to protect her? Moreover, they had a car. It would be more convenient for Miss Chen to go out wherever she wanted than taking a taxi, right?\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Tian Fei replied profoundly, \u201cLike is reckless, and love is restraint.\u201dCheng Peng looked askance at Tian Fei and said in disgust, \u201cYou\u2019d better watch less of those sentimental nonsense movies.\u201dWhen the car arrived in the suburbs, it was close to eleven thirty. It would soon be the early morning. Although filthy auras had not yet started to gather in the air, almost without deliberately looking, you could spot a few fluttering ghosts in the gloomy woods.Chen Yu scanned the surroundings, picked a wood with the weakest Yin Qi and walked there. Generally, Celestial Masters, who exorcised ghosts, would pick a place where the Yin Qi was the densest, because the malevolent ghosts there were more dangerous. However, Chen Yu\u2019s goal today was to try to exorcise a hundred ghosts. The quantity was paramount, while quality wasn\u2019t.Chen Yu walked into the woods and looked at the ghosts that thought they were hiding among the branches and announced loudly, \u201cFirst, let me introduce myself. I am a ghost exorcist. I will start exorcising in a while. If there are any of you who don\u2019t want to disappear in a smoke, leave here within five minutes.\u201dAfter Chen Yu\u2019s introduction, tranquility was restored in the woods again. Except for the rustling of leaves with the blowing wind, there was no other sound. Chen Yu didn\u2019t rush them to respond. She just raised her hand and took out her phone, planning to fight a five-minute landlord first. If these ghosts still refused to leave after five minutes, then she could only attack indiscriminately.\u201cSha-sha-sha-sha\u2026\u201dChen Yu\u2019s words still played a role. Some timid ghosts who didn\u2019t want to die flew away, while the rest waited in place with a fluke mentalityFive minutes passed. Chen Yu put her phone away and moved around a bit. With her body shrouded in evil qi, she started exorcising.Previously, Chen Yu exorcised relying on talismans and spiritual power, but today, she was going to exorcise relying on the evil qi she absorbed from Lou Ming. Spiritual power could purify the evil aura of ghosts when exorcising. If the resentment of malevolent ghosts weren\u2019t deep, they could even transcend and be redeemed through spiritual power. However, using evil qi to exorcise could annihilate a malevolent ghost. It was also for this reason that Chen Yu gave warning before taking action.The malevolent ghosts finally discovered Chen Yu\u2019s power and ran away, but in just 20 minutes, she wiped out almost 30 malevolent ghosts.\u201cHoo!\u201dA gust of wind seemingly blew by. Chen Yu found that the hostility and resentment drifting in the air after the malevolent ghosts were dispersed immediately began to gather little by little. She followed the direction the balls were advancing and perceived a magical force. That was\u2026that was where the Nian Beast was.Chen Yu lowered her head to examine her evil qi, but found that the evil qi she absorbed from Lou Ming remained motionless under the powerful purification power of the Nian Beast. It only consumed some of the evil qi she had absorbed from exorcising just now.\u201cSo it really didn\u2019t work.\u201d She initially thought that the evil qi that was transferred to her body could be purified. It turned out that it was also useless.\u201cMalevolent ghost, watch my sword.\u201d While Chen Yu was in a daze, a stern mantra suddenly erupted. Immediately after, a peach wooden sword heavily slashed Chen Yu\u2019s shoulders. Some of the evil qi in Chen Yu\u2019s body shook and dissipated.Chen Yu frowned in pain. She followed the source of the peach wooden sword and looked at the visitor. When she saw a teenager of about 15 or 16 years old, she rendered speechless: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Qin Guanhai, the 15th descendant of the Qin family. Malevolent ghost, die,\u201d the young man replied, raising his peach wooden sword and slashed at Chen Yu once more. Chen Yu couldn\u2019t bear it and kicked him.\u201cAh!\u201d Qin Guanhai shouted miserably as he flew backwards.\u201cLittle Junior Brother,\u201d an anxious voice came from outside the woods, then a young man around 27 or 28 ran over in a hurry.\u201cSenior Brother, this malevolent ghost is so powerful. Quickly collect her,\u201d Qin Guanhai shouted. He covered his stomach, where Chen Yu kicked, and pointed toward her.The young man was horrified when he noticed the evil qi around Chen Yu. He muttered inwardly:\u00a0What a malevolent ghost with a heavy evil qi.\u00a0Then Chen Yu suddenly turned around. After a while, the young man bowed to Chen Yu deeply and said, \u201cFellow Daoist, please excuse us.\u201dFellow Daoist?\u00a0Qin Guanhai looked at Chen Yu incredulously.\u201cYour junior brother\u2019s vision is poor, so don\u2019t let him wander around,\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but warn.\u201cSorry, my junior brother may have misunderstood because he saw that Fellow Daoist was covered in evil qi.\u201d In fact, the young man himself was curious about Chen Yu\u2019s evil qi that was so dense that it was more terrifying than the malevolent ghosts around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A person who could stand perfectly calm in place with such an oppressive evil qi showed that her cultivation was unfathomable.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d When Qin Guanhai discovered that his opponent was not a ghost but a human, his face flushed, and he apologized.\u201cDid you think I was a malevolent ghost before attacking?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cHmm.\u201d The young man nodded with a red face.\u201cWith just this level of cultivation, how did you have the courage to attack me?\u201d The evil qi in her body was comparable to that of a malevolent ghost with 600 years of dao. At a glance, the young man had been practicing the arts recently. So, where did he get his courage from?When the teenager heard this, he was even more ashamed of himself.The hour has arrived. The Nian Beast had begun to swallow the filthy aura, and the malevolent ghosts within a five mile radius around the beast began to stir. Chen Yu no longer continued talking to them, thinking that she still had 70 malevolent ghosts to exorcise. She turned out of the woods and headed toward the gathering of malevolent ghosts.Shortly after Chen Yu left, three more Celestial Masters came into the woods, led by a young man with delicate features. If Chen Yu was there, she would have recognized that the man was none other than Lu Ning, the owner of the Soul Summoning Bell she met in Pingcheng.\u201cGuanhai, are you okay?\u201d Lu Ning rushed forward with two other people.\u201cYeah.\u201d The teenager shook his head in a depressed mood.Noticing the teenager\u2019s low mood, Lu Ning looked strangely at the young man on the side and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201dConcerned about his Junior Brother\u2019s dignity, the young man shook his head and did not speak.Lu Ning also didn\u2019t pursue it. He only said out loud, \u201cIt\u2019s already past twelve, and the Nian beast has begun to swallow the filthy aura. The remaining malevolent ghosts will become more and more powerful. Let\u2019s act together and don\u2019t separate.\u201d\u201cLu Ning is right. The five of us should act together.\u201d The younger of the two who came with Lu Ning nodded in agreement.\u201cSenior Brother Liang, I\u2019ll lead the way in front, you take the rear. Let Liang Yu and Guanhai walk in the middle,\u201d Lu Ning suggested.Liang Guang nodded and agreed to Lu Ning\u2019s arrangement.In addition to Lu Ning, the other four of the five were descendants of the Liang and the Qin families, the two famed great families of exorcists in the capital. In order to accumulate merit points, the five came out together to exorcise ghosts. Liang Yu and Qin Guanhai were the worst of the five, so Lu Ning arranged them in the middle.The line of five people slowly advanced forward. While walking, they encountered malevolent ghosts and exorcised them. Of course, it was mainly the front and back of the three who did the exorcising.Liang Yu, who was walking in the middle, looked at the teenager who vigorously said that he wanted to kill monsters and demons before they left, but had now suddenly wilted with his head low. He asked curiously, \u201cGuanhai, what\u2019s wrong?\u201cBrother Liang Yu\u2026,\u201d the teenager said, looking at Liang Yu in dejection. \u201cI suddenly found myself so useless.\u201dLiang Yu asked curiously, \u201cWhy do you say that all of a sudden? My grandfather even praised you for your keen perception of yin and evil qi.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d It was because of this that the teenager was haunted by the fact that he just mistook a human being for a malevolent ghost ah. Good thing he merely used a peach wooden sword just now. If it were other magic weapons, what was he going to do if he had hurt someone?\u201cAlthough your current cultivation is not as good as your Senior Brother, that\u2019s because your enlightenment was late. In time, you will certainly be stronger than your brother.\u201d Liang Yu said, \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s miserable. I\u2019m not well qualified, and I definitely can\u2019t surpass my cousin.\u201dQin Guanhai also heard about Liang Yu\u2019s circumstances. Before he was enlightened, his situation at home was almost the same as that of Liang Yu. He was a direct descendant from a lineage of exorcists, but without much talent. The only advantage he had over Liang Yu was that he had no genius cousin above him. \u201cSenior Brother Liang Guang and Senior Brother Lu Ning are both rare geniuses in metaphysics, and my father said that their qualifications are rare.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of genius are they? I know another expert who is called genius.\u201d His online friend, Road Repair Expert, was only a freshman this year and collected a malevolent ghost that Liang Guang, the so-called genius, couldn\u2019t even clean up.Speaking of which, Road Repair Expert was also in the capital, so if he was also out to accumulate merit points, he should also be around here at this time. Reminded of this, Liang Yu took out his phone and sent a message to the expert: Master, Master, have you come out to exorcise?\u201cAre there geniuses who are more powerful than Senior Brother Lu Ning and Senior Brother Liang Guang?\u201d Qin Guanhai said in surprise.\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s possible that he\u2019s also around here.\u201d Liang Yu noticed that after sending the message, no reply came from the other side. Although he was a bit lost, he believed that the other party was probably busy exorcising at this time, so he did not think much about it.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d While the two were chatting, Qin Guanhai suddenly stopped in his tracks. He looked directly south of a valley and froze.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Liang Yu couldn\u2019t help but curiously asked when Qin Guanhai stopped moving.Qin Guanhai did not speak. He looked straight at the valley in the south, frowned and involuntarily had a cold shiver.Noticing that something was wrong with the teenager, Liang Yu hurriedly called out to the two people walking in front of him, \u201cLu Ning, Senior Brother Shao, wait a moment.\u201dLu Ning, who was scouting ahead, stopped at his call and turned around. He walked back a few steps to the two men: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cGuanhai suddenly stopped moving,\u201d Liang Yu explained.Lu Ning\u2019s eyebrows went rigid. His eyes darted and quickly exchanged a glance with Qin Guanhai\u2019s Senior Brother. The two coincidentally remembered the advice of the elders at home before they came out.At this time, Liang Guang, who had just finished solving a malevolent ghost also arrived. When he saw the four people standing still, he asked curiously, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you moving?\u201dLu Ning did not say anything but just pointed to Qin Guanhai\u2019s direction with his eyes.Liang Guang obviously also knew Qin Guanhai\u2019s peculiarity. Although he was also surprised, he didn\u2019t ask any further.After about five minutes, Qin Guanhai gradually regained his consciousness. He raised his finger to the valley he had just been staring at and said, \u201cThere\u2026 seems to be something over there. It\u2019s very dangerous.\u201dQin Guanhai was the young grandson of the current patriarch of the Qin family, born in a family of metaphysics like the Qin family. However, when he was young, he was unable to perceive spiritual power. It was only at the age of thirteen that he suddenly became enlightened, and after he did so, he possessed extremely strong perception and was able to foresee danger in advance.Before coming out, the Qin family repeatedly instructed that Qin Guanhai\u2019s trip outside this time to exorcise ghosts was focused on experience. If they found anything that made Qin Guanhai feel danger, then they must not touch it.\u201cThen let\u2019s go around it,\u201d Liang Yu, the timid one, said.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look.\u201d Liang Guang, however, became interested. When he walked this evening, the malevolent ghosts he encountered weren\u2019t good enough, and there was no challenge in fighting them.\u201cBut Uncle Qin has repeatedly instructed us not to go to a place that Guanhai feels dangerous.\u201d Lu Ning was a little embarrassed.\u201cGuanhai has only cultivated for three years, and he came out to exorcise ghosts for the first time this year. The places he thinks are dangerous does not mean that it\u2019s also dangerous to us, ah,\u201d Liang Guang countered.When Lu Ning heard that, he felt that Liang Guang\u2019s argument had some truth in it. Although Qin Guanhai\u2019s perception of Yin and Evil Qi was very keen, his cultivation level was too low. The danger he perceived wasn\u2019t necessarily dangerous for others.\u201cHow about this? I\u2019ll go alone and take a look.\u201d When Liang Guang saw Lu Ning hesitate, he decided to head there by himself to take a look.\u201cNo, we agreed to act together.\u201d Lu Ning hesitated and said, \u201cSenior Brother Shao, accompany Guanhai and Liang Yu and wait here. I\u2019ll go with Senior Brother Liang to check it out.\u201d\u201cI\u2026I want to go too,\u201d before Senior Brother Shao could answer, Qin Guanhai himself suddenly said.\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s dangerous? Are you still going when you feel it\u2019s dangerous?\u201d Liang Yu asked.\u201cI feel that there is something there, something very good.\u201d Although dangerous, it was something very good.Meanwhile, after using evil qi to dispel the 60th malevolent ghost, Chen Yu took out her phone to see how much time was left, and found a message from March Floating Rain.March Floating Rain: Great God, Great God, have you come out to exorcise?Chen Yu replied in passing: Yeah, you are also exorcising ghosts?Chen Yu replied. As soon as she put her mobile phone back in her pocket, she heard a Ding. She knew it was March Floating Rain\u2019s reply. When she was about to take it out and look again, a malevolent ghost pounced without warning. Chen Yu raised her eyebrow and slapped it, harvesting screams from it.Chen Yu forgot about the message on her phone as soon as she started exorcising. When she remembered it again, it was already twenty minutes later. She took her phone out and saw two huge characters on it, plus an exclamation mark:Help!\u2026\u2026If I go there now, will I be too late?Chen Yu looked at the location prompt that immediately followed. March Floating Rain was less than 500 meters away from her.The author has something to say:Lou Ming called home.Mrs. Lou: Son, why didn\u2019t you answer your phone just now?Lou Ming felt embarrassed: I didn\u2019t hear it ring.Mrs. Lou: Did you eat Sichuan cuisine this evening? Your lips are red and swollen.Lou Ming silently covered his mouth\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Besides, March Floating Rain was Chen Yu\u2019s first customer in the exorcism business and also had a favorable impression of him.After determining the location, Chen Yu turned out of the woods and ran all the way to the valley where March Floating Rain was stuck.\u201cWhere is Miss Chen Yu going?\u201d Cheng Peng, who had been hiding behind for secret protection, saw Chen Yu suddenly run away, and asked Tian Fei in confusion.\u201cMaybe there\u2019s something over there. Let\u2019s follow her.\u201d Tian Fei grasped an Evil Repelling Talisman in his hand and shook it around himself from time to time.When Cheng Peng saw his actions, he couldn\u2019t help rolling his eyes and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t see any ghosts. Why are you fooling\u2026\u201d\u201cCrackle\u2026\u201dBefore Cheng Peng could finish speaking, he saw the Evil Repelling Talisman in Tian Fei\u2019s hand suddenly burst into flames. Then, a pale blue flame soared up a short distance in front of the two people.\u201c\u2026\u201d Cheng Peng\u2019s face turned ugly as could be, feeling as if he suddenly swallowed a fly.\u201cLook!!!\u201d Tian Fei excitedly looked at his comrade. \u201cXiao Peng, do I count this as also exorcising a ghost?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Keep up!\u201d Feeling the instant slap on his face, Cheng Peng dashed into the woods, depressed, and chased after Chen Yu from a distance.Tian Fei excitedly pulled out another Evil Repelling Talisman first and tightly grasped it in his hand before following.Chen Yu reached the destination of about 500 meters in less than two minutes. Standing on the top of the hill, Chen Yu scanned the empty valley, her brows crumpled in confusion.This valley was too normal. It was completely an ordinary valley. There were even some new buds sprouting at the beginning of spring. But today was New Year\u2019s Eve, and the place was within the five-mile radius of the Nian Beast. It didn\u2019t make sense that the surrounding area was full of evil spirits and malevolent ghosts, while this area that seemed isolated from the world, became a paradise.Chen Yu thought for a moment, and then took out her phone. She clicked on March Floating Rain\u2019s dialog box and sent a voice call request.\u201cDu-du\u2026 Du-du\u2026\u201dThe sound of a phone requesting a call kept echoing through the valley, but there was no sound from the other end of the phone in the silent valley.Is there no signal?Chen Yu put her phone away, pulled out the compass she had no opportunity to use all night today, and took a step into the valley.And then she disappeared entirely in place, out of thin air.\u201cWhere did she go?\u201d The person Cheng Peng was protecting disappeared right in front of his eyes. He was so scared that he flew out from behind the tree trunk where he was hiding.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tian Fei looked up, but Chen Yu\u2019s figure was no longer on the hill. \u201cWhere is Miss Chen Yu?\u201dThe two men quickly ran up the hill and looked down. There was nothing in the empty valley except trees and rocks.\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Within merely ten seconds of Tian Fei turning around to check the situation behind him, Chen Yu unexpectedly disappeared. He turned his head to ask Cheng Peng, who had been paying attention to Chen Yu.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Cheng Peng recalled the sight he saw just now. He still found it unbelievable until now: \u201cJust now, Miss Chen Yu was still standing here, then she took a step forward, and then suddenly disappeared immediately after. She disappeared into thin air.\u201d\u201cDisappeared into thin air? How could that be possible?\u201d Tian Fei rhetorically asked in horror.\u201c\u2026\u201d This world had the Nian Beast and malevolent ghosts. What else was impossible?They couldn\u2019t find Chen Yu, so the two could only stand stupidly on the hill, looking at the moonlit empty and quiet valley at a loss.The moment Chen Yu stepped into the valley, she first felt a slight coolness soaking her body, followed by Yin and Evil Qi blasting on her face. She was caught off guard and was blown backward several steps before standing firmly.\u201cWhat a heavy evil qi! How come I didn\u2019t perceive a strand of it outside? Strange\u2026\u201d Chen Yu stood still first, and then turned around in surprise.Chen Yu remembered that she had only taken one step forward, and it was downhill. However, when she took several more steps backward just now, there was surprisingly no uphill feeling. She was dumbfounded, staring at the empty pitch black behind. Where were those hills and steep slopes? Darkness was all around, and even the moonlight offered no visibility.This\u2026 has a ghost built a barrier?Just as the thought formed, Chen Yu denied it herself. With her current cultivation base, tricks like ghosts barriers didn\u2019t work for her at all.Then what the hell was going on here? Chen Yu was sure that this was still the same valley as before. However, after one step away, why did it change so drastically?\u201cCould this be a magical barrier?\u201d After pondering for a long time, Chen Yu guessed a possibility.But magical barrier of this kind almost only appeared in the legends of formations. Nowadays, no one should be able to wield it, ah. Moreover, if any of the masters had the ability to set up a magical barrier, why not directly do it to dispel the evil qi here, instead of wasting much effort to set up this barrier?\u201cAh!!!\u201dJust when Chen Yu was trying to figure out what was going on here, a scream suddenly came from the depths of the valley filled with evil qi.March Floating Rain? Chen Yu was startled. Before she had time to think, she sped towards the source of the scream with talismans in one hand and the compass in the other.\u201cShut up!\u201d Liang Guang warded off the approaching malevolent ghosts on one side, and scolded without looking back.\u201cBrother Liang Yu, are you all right?\u201d Qin Guanhai looked at Liang Yu\u2019s wrist that a malevolent ghost blackened and was filled with worry.\u201cYes.\u201d Liang Yu said ashen-faced. He also knew that he should not add to the chaos at this time , but a malevolent ghost just almost dragged him away, so he did not hold his scream back.\u201cThe malevolent ghosts here are very powerful. We can only barely cope, so you must not move again.\u201d Lu Ning took a look at the phone that Liang Yu was holding tightly in his hand and wanted to say something, but in the end said nothing.\u201cBrother Liang Yu, if your phone\u2019s lost, leave it be. Why did you have to pick it up?\u201d Just now, Liang Yu went to pick his phone up and was almost dragged away by a malevolent ghost. Fortunately, Lu Ning nimbly pulled him back.\u201cI\u2019m looking for Great God to save us.\u201d The five of them entered the valley about half an hour or so ago. After entering, they immediately sensed that something was wrong, but when they attempted to return, they couldn\u2019t find the way out.With no other choice, the five people had to feel their way around the valley, trying to find a way out. Unfortunately, after walking for a short while, they encountered a malevolent ghost siege. Five or six powerful malevolent ghosts attacked at the same time. Thanks to Lu Ning\u2019s timely reaction, he stunned them with his Soul Summoning Bell, and they avoided the sudden ghost attack.Lu Ning, Liang Guang, and Shao Qi\u2019s cultivation bases were quite powerful. The three protected Qin Guanhai and Liang Yu, the two who had low cultivation, and carried on the fight while beating a retreat. Nonetheless, they weren\u2019t the opponents of the malevolent ghosts which were growing in number. In the end, the five people were forced to retreat in a mountain col, trapped by a dozen malevolent ghosts and unable to move.\u201cThere\u2019s no signal here either.\u201d The moment they found that they couldn\u2019t get out, they tried to call their elders to rescue them, but there was no signal on the mobile phone at that time.\u201cThere is!\u201d Liang Yu tapped his phone interface and showed Qin Guanhai his conversation with the Great God, \u201cWasn\u2019t there a flash of light earlier? The phone signal was restored for a few seconds at that time.\u201dWhen Liang Yu and others met the malevolent ghost attack for the first time, a colorful light suddenly flashed in the sky, and then Liang Yu heard a mobile prompt sound from his phone. The moment Liang Yu found that his mobile phone had a signal, he used his hand speed of being single for more than 20 years. In just two seconds, he typed the word \u2018help\u2019 and conveniently sent his location.March Floating Rain : Great God, Great God, have you come out to exorcise?I want to Fix the Road: Yeah, you also are exorcising?March Floating Rain: Help! (Follow the location coordinates.)Qin Guanhai found that the first sentence was sent fifty minutes ago; the other party\u2019s reply was twenty minutes ago, and twenty minutes ago, the five of them were already in the valley.\u201cThere\u2019s really a signal?\u201d Qin Guanhai said in surprise.\u201cGreat God is definitely looking for me right now.\u201d Liang Yu said, \u201cBut there are too many malevolent ghosts here. Great God can\u2019t handle it alone for sure. I have to send a message to Great God and ask him to get help.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you call your grandfather?\u201d Qin Guanhai was puzzled. There was a signal, so why not contact the elders of the family?\u201cIt was just a few seconds, and the signal was cut off before I could connect to my Grandpa,\u201d Liang Yu said.\u201cYou could have sent messages, too, ah,\u201d Qin Guanhai reminded him.\u201c\u2026\u201d Liang Yu was stunned for an instant. For some reason, at that time, his eyes were only Road Repair Expert.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He took out his phone and started editing a message, intending to click send directly the moment the signal was restored again.Chen Yu followed the screams all the way. She was originally wondering about the absence of malevolent ghosts in such dense evil qi, but upon seeing dozens of ghosts flocking around a few people at a mountain col, her doubts were immediately solved.\u201cBrother Shao, keeping at this is no solution, ah,\u201d Liang Guang said towards Shao Qi.\u201cHold on a little longer. The Nian Beast will be leaving soon.\u201d The Nian Beast only appeared for one hour from 11 to 1 am. It would leave once the time was up. Once the beast left, the malevolent ghosts would also stop absorbing evil qi and scatter.\u201cI have this feeling that these malevolent ghosts are different from those outside.\u201d The Yin Qi and evil Qi in the place were remarkably much stronger than outside, and there was no need for these malevolent ghosts to covet the Yin and evil Qi that the Nian Beast condensed.\u201cThen let\u2019s wait until dawn.\u201d Although ghosts weren\u2019t afraid of sunlight, most ghosts still liked to amble around at night. Maybe these evil spirits would leave first thing in the morning.\u201cI don\u2019t have enough talismans on me\u2026\u201d Liang Guang drew out a talisman, but there was no more. And then, a malevolent ghost roared and attacked. He tried to block it with his peach wooden sword, but there came a snap. The sword couldn\u2019t withstand the impact of the ghost\u2019s Yin Qi and instantly shattered into two halves.\u201cWatch out!\u201d Lu Ning released his hand and rang the Soul Summoning Bell. After a jingle, the malevolent ghost attacking Liang Guang stoppedLiang Guang was frightened. He threw the peach wooden sword in his hand, and turned around to grab the magic weapon in Liang Yu\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Liang Yu reflexively covered his magic weapon. He knew it. Liang Guang had been coveting his magic weapon.\u201cGive it to me if you don\u2019t want to die.\u201d Liang Guang glared at his stupid cousin, drew Liang Yu\u2019s peach wooden sword and turned back to cut the malevolent ghost. Liang Yu\u2019s peach wooden sword was a rare and superb magic weapon. Moreover, the techniques used to restrain Yin Qi with it were extremely powerful. The malevolent ghost was swept by the peach wooden sword and took a step backwards.The five had a break, but they still couldn\u2019t get out of the col and guard steadfastly.Just when they were hesitating what to do next, a mournful and shrill scream suddenly echoed, and then a blue flame suddenly ignited in the dark space, which was the color of a soul burning when a malevolent ghost was being wiped out.\u201cArghhh!!\u201dChen Yu, with a blood-red evil qi, walked amidst the malevolent ghosts. Perhaps because of the heavy evil qi on Chen Yu\u2019s body, or perhaps because the malevolent ghosts in the place were already delirious, these ghosts did not attack Chen Yu. However, Chen Yu wasn\u2019t as polite as they were. She directly reached out and captured a malevolent ghost and her evil qi to restrain her opponent.However, the malevolent ghosts here seemed to be quite powerful. Chen Yu\u2019s unimpeded evil qi outside the valley seemed to have little effect on these malevolent ghosts. Seeing this, Chen Yu could only reach out and take out a high-grade Spirit-Repelling Talisman from her pocket and stick it on.\u201cShwa\u2026\u201d With a sizzle, blue flames instantly burned.Chen Yu moved simply and swiftly in the same manner. Almost as soon as she captured a malevolent ghost with one hand, a sizzling flame could be heard. Balls of flames lit up, and the malevolent ghosts turned into ashes, one by one.Finally, when Chen Yu killed the seventh ghost, the rest of the malevolent ghosts scattered away in fear. The valley became quiet again.With Chen Yu\u2019s terrifying power and formidable exorcism skills, she shocked the five young Celestial Masters in the col.The five opposite her were nothing but dumbfounded, as well as shocked beyond words.\u201cWhich one of you is March Floating Rain?\u201d Chen Yu wrinkled her eyebrows and asked.\u201cGreat\u2026 Great God?\u201d Liang Yu came back to his senses and asked incredulously.\u201cYou are March Floating Rain?\u201d Chen Yu looked at Liang Yu.Liang Yu mechanically nodded.\u201cSeven million!\u201d Chen Yu used her fingers to indicate seven. One million for a high-grade talisman, and that was not counting the labor cost.\u201c\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, Cheng Peng and Tian Fei searched the perimeter but still couldn\u2019t find Chen Yu\u2019s whereabouts. The two people finally could only call to report the situation.Lou Ming called Chen Yu as soon as he received the message. The response was that the other party was out of reach. Lou Ming immediately hung up the phone and then called Elder Wu.\u201cHello?\u201d Elder Wu answered nonchalantly.\u201cElder Wu, Shishi has disappeared,\u201d Lou Ming reported anxiously.\u201cShe went out to exorcise the ghost,\u201d Elder Wu said.\u201cNo\u2026 the people I sent to protect Shishi reported that she suddenly disappeared in a valley. They are sure that she\u2019s in that valley, but they can\u2019t find her,\u201d Lou Ming anxiously explained the reason.\u201cShe suddenly disappeared?\u201d\u201cYes. Elder Wu, I\u2019ll send someone to drive you there. Please go over to see how Shishi is doing,\u201d Lou Ming suggested.\u201cOops!\u201d Elder Wu suddenly exclaimed.\u201cElder Wu, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lou Ming, who thought that something had really happened to Chen Yu, nervously stood up straight at once.\u201cNothing, I\u2019m PKing with someone here. I almost died,\u201d Elder Wu then added, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry too much. That girl will be fine. If something happens, I will know before you do.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Lou Ming was still unsure.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. She\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll hang up now.\u201d Elder Wu casually hung up Lou Ming\u2019s call and continued his game.Just five minutes later\u2026Elder Wu deeply realized what face slapping was. He just said that Chen Yu would be fine. As a result, the girl turned around and used seven advanced Spirit-Repelling Talismans.What exactly did she encounter to use so many high-grade talismans? Although malevolent ghosts would come out on New Year\u2019s Eve to absorb evil qi and enhance their cultivation, how could really powerful malevolent ghosts crave for these evil qi? Hence, the ones who came out on New Year\u2019s Eve were all relatively weaker ghosts. With Chen Yu\u2019s current cultivation level, nothing would happen even if she closed her eyes.Elder Wu pondered over it, picked up the phone he had just thrown aside, and dialed back: \u201cSend a car over.\u201dA short time later, the car Lou Ming arranged arrived downstairs. For fear that Mother Chen and Father would ask, Elder Wu directly jumped out of the window.When he pulled the car door open, he found Lou Ming inside and was already waiting for him. He raised his brow and asked, \u201cAre you coming, too?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t feel at ease,\u201d Lou Ming returned.\u201cThere are many malevolent ghosts there, and you\u2019re full of evil qi. It\u2019s unwise for you to be there,\u201d Elder Wu warned him.Malevolent ghosts couldn\u2019t stand the force of Lou Ming\u2019s evil spirit, and they would disappear when he got near. However, when he was far away, the remaining evil qi Lou Ming left was a great tonic.\u201cElder Wu, please help me draw an Evil Restraining Talisman to suppress my aura.\u201d This was something Lou Ming had thought of long ago.\u201c\u2026\u201d That girl, how could she tell him everything? How could he randomly draw Evil Restraining Talismans for others?The author has something to say:The moment Liang Yu discovered that Chen Yu was the Road Repair Expert, a line flashed in his heart:\u201cGOD is a girl^\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She wasn\u2019t really curious about why Lu Ning appeared here. She nodded in response and continued to look at the dazed March Floating Rain.Liang Yu came back to his senses. As a return customer of good quality, he instantly understood what appealed to Chen Yu eyes. He immediately assured her, \u201cI\u2019ll transfer the money once we\u2019re out. The signal here isn\u2019t good.\u201dOnly then did Chen Yu nod confidently.\u201cTransfer? Liang Yu, do you Daoist Friend Chen money?\u201d How come Daoist Chen asked for money as soon as she saw Liang Yu? Could it be that Daoist Chen chased him to this place because of a debt?\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Liang Yu shook his head and didn\u2019t know how to explain for a moment. If he said the money was spent asking the Great God to save his life, would it reduce the Great God\u2019s dignity too much?\u201cIt\u2019s a labor fee.\u201d Chen Yu failed to live up to Liang Yu\u2019s good intentions. \u201cMarch Floating Rain came to me online and asked for help. I just used seven high-grade Spirit-Repelling Talismans. A million each so that\u2019s a total of seven million.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Liang Yu felt that the Great God lived too honestly.\u00a0What dignity? She doesn\u2019t need it at all.\u201c\u2026\u201d Without preparation, Lu Ning suddenly heard the price of his life. Lu Ning refused to accept it. In fact, his family was loaded, and he was worth far more than 1.4 million.\u201cFellow Daoist, do you know how to get out of here?\u201d Liang Guang listened quietly for a long time. Although he was also speechless about Chen Yu\u2019s charging behavior, at this time, he was more concerned about how to leave the place.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Chen Yu shook her head honestly.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how to get out?\u201d Lu Ning repeated in disappointment.\u201cI heard someone screaming as soon as I came in, and then I ran here in a hurry before I had time to find a way out,\u201d Chen Yu said.\u201cThen let\u2019s look for it together,\u201d Shao Qi suggested. Now that there was a Celestial Master with a high level of cultivation, they didn\u2019t have to be afraid to encounter malevolent ghosts again.Everyone had no objections, so the six of them looked for a way out in the pitch-dark valley. They went around for a long time, and wandered around the valley two or three laps more, but they didn\u2019t find a way out.\u201cWhat exactly is going on here? We came in but couldn\u2019t find the way out?\u201d Liang Guang said irritably.\u201cThis place is odd to begin with, and the scenery in the valley is different from what we saw first,\u201d Lu Ning said.\u201cThat\u2019s right. We didn\u2019t even feel that there was evil qi here before we entered the valley,\u201d Shao Qi seconded. If there was, there was no way they failed to sense it.\u201cWe may not be in the valley anymore,\u201d Liang Yu suddenly inserted.\u201c?\u201d The crowd looked at Liang Yu in confusion.\u201cWhen we entered earlier, the valley was clearly filled with some ordinary flowers and trees, but look at this place now. It\u2019s dark with only malevolent ghosts plus Yin Qi and evil Qi,\u201d Liang Yu justified his findings, \u201cMoreover\u2026 didn\u2019t Road Repair Expert say that her location was only 500 meters from the valley. However, it took a full twenty minutes to come here.\u201d\u201cEr\u2026 that\u2026\u201d Chen Yu interrupted with some embarrassment, \u201cI only saw your message twenty minutes\u00a0 after.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA gust of wind blew by, and the atmosphere suddenly turned a little awkward.\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d Lu Ning forcibly changed the subject, \u201cLet\u2019s think about how to get out.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been searching for a long time, but there\u2019s no road at all.\u201d Liang Guang said, \u201cIf this is still the same valley as just now, then there is only one explanation; we are inside some powerful formation.\u201d\u201cFormation?\u201d Shao Qi was reminded of it. Liang Guang\u2019s conjecture was very likely. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a formation, how are we going to break it?\u201dThe crowd looked at each other, momentarily having run out of ideas. They didn\u2019t even know what kind of formation it was, so how were they going to break it?\u201cI have a suggestion,\u201d Chen Yu suddenly spoke out.\u201cFellow Daoist Chen, have you thought of a solution?\u201d Lu Ning asked in surprise, and the rest of the few people remembered Chen Yu\u2019s formidable strength.\u201cJust a suggestion. It\u2019s not necessarily successful\u2026\u201d said Chen Yu, \u201cI was thinking that since we can\u2019t find a way out and don\u2019t know how to break the formation, why not start with what we can do right now?\u201d\u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d Lu Ning said curiously.\u201cExorcise.\u201d Chen Yu analyzed, \u201cWe can get rid of the malevolent ghosts here, exorcise the Yin and Evil Qi, and then see what changes the formation will have.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d Liang Guang nodded and agreed.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Just as the crowd nodded and decided to proceed with this first, Chen Yu suddenly uttered another but.\u201cBut what?\u201d Lu Ning asked.\u201cBut this will increase the cost of my rescue.\u201d Chen Yu said, business-like, \u201cYou see, an advanced exorcism talisman costs one million. When you exorcise ghosts in a while, you will definitely need to use some again, then my fee marking will need to be adjusted.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHow about I give you a discount?\u201d Considering that she couldn\u2019t get out of the place either, Chen Yu decided to charge a little less.\u201cNo need!\u201d The wealthy Liang Guang rolled his eyes and said, \u201cAs long as we can get out, we can still afford this price.\u201dChen Yu\u2019s eyes lit up when she looked at Liang Guang. It turned out that local tyrants grew like this!With a plan ahead, the group no longer dallied. Shao Qi protected Qin Guanhai and Liang Yu. Chen Yu took Lu Ning and Liang Guang to annihilate the remaining malevolent ghosts with high-grade Spirit-Repelling Talismans.After collecting the malevolent ghosts, the Yin and Evil Qi dissipated in the valley, but no change still occurred in the valley. They also remained unable to find their way out.Things were back to square one again. The group sat down on the ground to rest with their heads hanging.Chen Yu looked at the time and found that it was about to hit 3:00 a.m. If she wasn\u2019t back at dawn, her parents would be worried. Once they were worried, they would certainly let the old man come to find her. Once her grandpa comes, she would certainly be mocked. The mere thought of it didn\u2019t sit well with her.\u201cWhy did you guys get in here?\u201d Chen Yu couldn\u2019t help but ask.The friends froze, and their eyes turned in unison to Qin Guanhai, who hadn\u2019t spoken much since entering the valley.Seeing everyone looking at him, Qin Guanhai apologized guiltily, \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d\u201cWas it you who wanted to come?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Qin Guanhai had been blaming himself since they entered the valley, and he didn\u2019t say much along the way. He was just afraid of dragging everyone down again.\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. You have warned us that this place is dangerous. Coming here was also everyone\u2019s unanimous decision,\u201d Lu Ning comforted him.Liang Yu was tempted to say that he opposed it, but they all didn\u2019t listen. In the end, he had to spend money to save his life. He was the most innocent person.\u201cWait\u2026 You guys knew it was dangerous here before you came in?\u201d Chen Yu grabbed the point.\u201cYes, Guanhai\u2019s six senses are very strong. When we were on the outskirts of the valley, Guanhai sensed something here, and we wanted to come over to check it out. But he also warned us before we came, saying that there would be danger here.\u201d Lu Ning said objectively, \u201cWe thought too highly of ourselves.\u201d\u201cSomething? What kind of stuff?\u201d Chen Yu knew that what Qin Guanhai perceived certainly would not be these malevolent ghosts. The valley outside had mountains full of malevolent ghosts. He mustn\u2019t have come this far specially to look at malevolent ghosts.Lu Ning also had no idea what that something was. Qin Guanhai hesitated and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just perceived something here. That thing is very powerful. I guess it should be some kind of powerful magic weapon.\u201dMagic weapon!Chen Yu straightened up at once, and her voice rose an octave higher: \u201cSomething\u2026 No\u2026 Is that something you felt still here?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d Qin Guanhai nodded.\u201cWhere?\u201d Chen Yu asked.\u201cOver there!\u201d Qin Guanhai pointed to a boulder not far from them. In fact, since entering the valley, Qin Guanhai clearly detected the location of that thing. It was just that as soon as they entered the valley, they were besieged and chased by malevolent ghosts. At present, they were still trapped in the valley with no idea how to escape. Twinges of guilt stabbed him. He never should have mentioned that thing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Before the friends could react, she almost flew towards the boulder as she ran.The remaining five people froze, but they also scrambled up and chased after her.The boulder looked entirely ordinary. At closer look, they found a vine coiled on it, which was different from the withered and black vines around it. The vine was lush and was growing robustly.Chen Yu examined it closer and faintly felt a powerful aura from the inside of the boulder.There is really something inside!Just as Chen Yu stretched her hand to touch it, a bright seven-colored spiritual light shot out from inside the boulder without warning.\u201cIt\u2019s this light!\u201d Liang Yu said excitedly, \u201cPhone signal.\u201dLiang Yu lowered his head and took out his phone, but unfortunately, when he raised his phone up, the signal was once again blocked, and the message he edited in advance was not sent out.\u201cWe seem to have seen this light a while ago,\u201d Shao Qi recalled.\u201cYes, I saw it not long ago.\u201d Lu Ning stood next to Chen Yu and observed the boulder for a while, and also sensed something inside. \u201cIt seems there\u2019s really something here.\u201d\u201cWhat could it be?\u201d Everyone wondered.Chen Yu stood in front of the boulder, a bit stunned. She didn\u2019t know if it was an illusion, but the moment the seven-colored spiritual light appeared just now, she felt that the evil qi on her body seemed to have decreased a little. However, the time when the colorful spiritual light appeared was too short, making her a little uncertain. Was her evil qi naturally evaporated from her body or absorbed by the colorful spiritual light?With such a doubt, Chen Yu decided to reach out and try it out.\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d Qin Guanhai, who had been standing on the periphery, saw Chen Yu reaching out to touch the boulder and suddenly perceived a strong danger. He quickly called her to a stop, but unfortunately, he was a step too late.The moment Chen Yu\u2019s palm touched the boulder, a towering evil spirit suddenly rushed out from within the boulder. A dark and heavy mass blasted in the air, but something seemingly blocked it. Finally, it scattered in all directions. Immediately afterwards, a dull hissing emanated within the boulder, and the huge boulder began to tremble violently. It was as if something was pinned down by the boulder, and it was trying to push it away and jump out from inside.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d The group stared in horror at the huge boulder that kept shaking.\u201cRoar\u2026 Roar\u2026\u201d\u201cInside\u2026 it seems\u2026 there\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cZombie!\u201d Chen Yu asserted, \u201cFrom the concentration of evil qi just now, I\u2019m afraid this is a millennium-old zombie!\u201dWhen the five people heard that it was a millennium-old, their faces instantly turned white as sheets. A zombie and a malevolent ghost weren\u2019t at all on the same level, okay? With their strength today, how could they beat a millennium-old zombie?!\u201cGreat\u2026 Great God, can you beat this millennium-old zombie?\u201d Liang Yu tremblingly asked Chen Yu, the only calm one.\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Chen Yu shook her head bluntly. Although she bluffed Lou Ming the first time they met that she could catch a millennium-old zombie easily,\u2026 that was because the old man was around ah!!!\u201cTh-Then what are we going to do?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d better brainstorm on how to get out,\u201d said Chen Yu. As long as they could get out, she could fetch the old man and everything would be fine, so she turned around and moved to continue searching for the exit.\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s useless.\u201d Liang Guang said sullenly, \u201cI have been curious about who would set up such a large formation here. Now, nine out of ten, it is probably to trap this zombie. If this is the case, I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t get out without getting rid of the zombie.\u201dThinking about the possibility of this speculation, the faces of the friends turned a few shades whiter.\u201cGraaa\u2026 Graaa\u2026\u201d The boulder trembled more and more violently, and the zombie\u2019s roar sounded even more shrill.\u201cKa-chow!\u201d A faint cracking sounded. Amidst the zombie\u2019s roar and the boulder\u2019s shaking, that crack was akin to a thunderbolt that fell on everyone\u2019s ears.A crack in the boulder?\u201cIt\u2019s coming out.\u201d Everyone retreated three meters away in fright.\u201cI told you not to touch it,\u201d Qin Guanhai said weakly.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d the culprit, Chen Yu, laughed dryly, \u201cThis zombie\u2019s senses are too keen. A mere touch actually woke it up, hehehe\u2026\u201dWhen Lou Ming and Elder Wu arrived at the valley, Cheng Peng and Tian Fei were waiting there anxiously.\u201cThird Young Master!\u201d\u201cThird Young Master!\u201dThe two hurriedly greeted the approaching Lou Ming and his company.\u201cWhere did Shishi go missing?\u201d Lou Ming asked anxiously.\u201cHere.\u201d Cheng Peng did not dare to delay and pointed to the location where Chen Yu was standing before her disappearance. He added, \u201cAt that time, Tian Fei and I were behind a pine tree ten meters away, and Miss Chen Yu was standing here. She seemed to want to enter the valley, so she took a step forward. After just one step, she disappeared entirely into thin air.\u201d\u201cDisappeared into thin air?\u201d Lou Ming repeated incredulously.\u201cI was staring at Miss Chen Yu, and I didn\u2019t even blink. Just one step, about two seconds before and after, Miss Chen Yu disappeared in a puff right under my eyes,\u201d Cheng Peng stressed again and again.Lou Ming frowned, looking at the valley in full view and asked, \u201cWhere have you all searched?\u201d\u201cWe searched the surrounding woods, but we still couldn\u2019t find her.\u201d Tian Fei not only didn\u2019t find Chen Yu, but also drove away three malevolent ghosts along the way.\u201cElder Wu\u2026\u201d Lou Ming was about to turn his head to ask Elder Wu for help, but he was taken aback when he saw him standing on the hill and looking ahead: \u201cElder Wu, is there anything wrong?\u201d\u201cAwesome\u2026\u201d Elder Wu clicked his tongue in astonishment. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect a magical barrier to be here.\u201d\u201cA magical barrier?\u201d Lou Ming had read about magical barriers from books and knew what it was, \u201cCould it be that Shishi is inside? Elder Wu, do you have a way to unseal the barrier?\u201d\u201cA magical barrier is a very advanced formation. Nowadays\u2026\u201d Elder Wu said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if others know how. Anyway, I can\u2019t do it.\u201dEven Elder Wu couldn\u2019t unseal it? Lou Ming\u2019s face turned white, and his heartbeat seemed to have stopped.\u201cI\u2019ll call and ask Master Mao,\u201d Lou Ming said and was about to call.\u201cIf he\u2019s capable of it, he would have been able to separate the evil qi from your body,\u201d Elder Wu spat.\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d Among the masters Lou Ming knew, Master Mao was considered the one with the highest cultivation level.\u201cI\u2019ll go in first and take a look!\u201d Elder Wu pondered for a moment and said, \u201cI hope that girl is okay.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Lou Ming said immediately.\u201cDo as you please!\u201d Elder Wu raised his eyebrows indifferently. He turned around and stepped into the barrier, then he, too, disappeared in front of the crowd\u2019s eyes.Seeing such a miraculous spectacle, the crowd was startled again.Lou Ming followed closely. He was about to step in, but He Qi stopped him: \u201cYoung Master, you can\u2019t go in.\u201d\u201cHe Qi.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, as Mr. Wu said just now, he can\u2019t unseal the barrier. If he goes in, he may not come out. You can\u2019t go in.\u201d After He Qi finished speaking, the rest of the assistants quickly followed suit and blocked his way.Lou Ming stopped in his tracks and didn\u2019t order He Qi to get out of the way. After a moment of meditation, he suddenly said, \u201cYou should know that I like Shishi.\u201dThe assistants were stunned. They couldn\u2019t understand why their Young Master suddenly confessed his love.\u201cYour responsibility is to keep me safe, and I know what I\u2019m doing now is very irresponsible for you guys, but\u2026 Shishi is in there,\u201d Lou Ming said, \u201cI want to go in.\u201dHe Qi opened his mouth, but those countless words to stop him that piled up to his throat suddenly couldn\u2019t get out.\u201cElder Wu has already gone in. He must have a way to save Miss Chen Yu,\u201d Cheng Peng said on He Qi\u2019s behalf.\u201cBut I\u2019m standing right here.\u201d Lou Ming asked, \u201cIf the person you like is in danger inside, can you stand here and wait for others to save her?\u201dNo!This answer crossed everyone\u2019s mind.Elder Wu waited inside the barrier until Lou Ming came in, then he asked as if he had forgotten what he said, \u201cI told you, right? You might not get out once you\u2019re in.\u201d\u201cYou did.\u201d Lou Ming smiled gently.The author has something to say:After Lou Ming entered the magical barrier, the assistants also wanted to follow, but could not enter the boundary.He Qi wondered: Why can they enter, but we can\u2019t?Cheng Peng: Elder Wu is a Celestial Master.He Qi: What about Young Master?Tian Fei: Young Master is the son-in-law of a Celestial Master\u2019s family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
