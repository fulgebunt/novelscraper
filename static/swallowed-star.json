    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: Luo FengTranslator: Translation NationEditor: Translation NationThe azure sky seemed like a gigantic blue emerald, the midsummer sun seemed like a huge fireball, hung on the top of this huge emerald. Using the sun's position, one could estimate it was around 3 PM.Zhi-An region's 3rd high school.[DING DING DING]As the loud bell spread across the entire campus, the campus suddenly arose with commotion and ruckus. Each building poured with students, laughing in groups towards the school gate.\"Luo Feng brother! Luo Feng brother*!\" a thick voice said.*This brother is one used in respect (not blood related kind)\"Feng, someone's calling for you\"In the midst of the group of students, a teenager who was holding a bookmark walked along with the students. He was wearing a regular blue sports uniform and was around 175 cm, and was a bit skinny. At this time, he hesitantly turned his head. The person calling for him was a guy around 190 cm with tiger-like shoulders and a bear-like waist. His biceps were even more brawny and astonishing.\"You are?\" Luo Feng hesitantly watched his approach, not recognizing who was in front of him.These two people: one sturdy and like a brown bear, while \"Luo Feng Brother\" was like a regular person.And height...The difference was immensely large. However, this broad shouldered, large waisted guy, seemed to display formality. He carefully looked at the \"Luo Feng Brother\" he admired.\"Looks like the rumors were right. Luo Feng brother is quite easy to talk to.\"\"Luo Feng brother, I... I have something that I need Luo Feng brother's help with.\"\"With what?\" Luo Feng laughed.\"While I was training my fists, I felt like there was something wrong when I punched. I was wondering if brother had any time to give me any pointers.\"The burly guy continued,\"According to the dojo teacher, with my strength, I should be able to release a punch that is over 50% in power. However, I can never reach that value at all.\"The burly guy looked expectantly at Luo Feng.\"Oh... I see.\" Luo feng paused for a moment, nodding his head.\"Okay, this Friday during noon, find me at the dojo.\"\"Thank you brother. Thank you brother\" The burly guy repeatedly thanked.Luo Feng laughed a bit and then left with his friends.Seeing that Luo Feng has left, the burly guy displayed his excitement. He clenched his fist, and as his bicep's veins were bursting, excitedly shouted out:\"SUCCESS!\"\"Wow! Luo Feng brother agreed that easily?!\" A boy wearing a school uniform exclaimed.\"The rumors are indeed true; Luo Feng brother is easy to talk to and is a good person\" The burly guy grinned.\"But.... that's not right. In our 3rd high school*, in the 5000 students, only three are able to achieve the title of \"Martial Arts Elite Student\". In those three students, the other two are 'Zhang Hao Bai' and 'Liu Ting', but they are too prideful and aren't willing to use their time to guide us.\" The boy wearing the school uniform said doubtfully.\"But Luo Feng brother is this kind?\"*3rd is just the number of the high school, not their ranking or any of the sort.At this moment, around the entire world in each country's region, virtually every high school student, while receiving a basic education, joins a martial arts dojo to unleash the power sleeping within every human.Zhi-An region's 3rd high school, with three grades and around 5000 high school students.For the most part, are all beginners in the dojo! Only an extremely small amount are \"intermediate members\". And only three can achieve the title of \"Elite member\"!\"Seeing is believing. Heh heh. See that? Luo Feng brother is different from the other two.\" The burly guy curled his lips.\"Zhang Hao Bai and Liu Ting, their families are all filled with wealthy people. Ever since they were young, their families spent an enormous amount of money to raise and train them, which is why they are so strong now. However, Luo Feng is completely different from them!\"The boy wearing the school uniform nodded in agreement. \"I also heard that Luo Feng brother's has a regular background. He even lives in a low rent house.\"\"Yes, for Luo Feng brother to get to where he is today, was entirely out of bitter training. Relying on his fists and feet to train. Totally different from Zhang Hao Bai and Liu Ting.\"The burly guy clenched his fist and took a deep breath. \"My goal is Luo Feng brother, and before I graduate from college, within these four years, I will pass the dojo's test and achieve the rank of \"Elite member\"!\".......At this moment, the Luo Feng brother they are talking about is just following the stream of people headed towards the third gate with another boy in a sports uniform.\"Feng, when that big blockhead who was asking you for tips walked away, he was praising you.\" The boy wearing the sports uniform started laughing.\"Praising what a great person you are and how you're so easy to talk to.\"Luo Feng laughed. \"What, you jealous, Wei Wen?\"\"Jealous of you?\" Wei Wen touched his nose and laughed.\"In your dreams. I was sighing that the blockhead doesn't even know 'Luo Feng Brother's' true side. But I remember in vivid detail... that time on the dojo competition platform, the 'Luo Feng Brother' he praises fought three people consecutively. And those three high schoolers couldn't even climb back up again.\"Luo Feng laughed.Indeed, that match was his rise to fame.Luo Feng hit Wei Wen's shoulder, \"Let's go home now.\"Wei Wen's shoulder made an exaggerated shake, \"Feng, lighter please. With that one hit, my shoulder is about to shatter!\"\"This again!\"Wei Wen is Luo Fen's great friend who has played with him ever since he was small. Even though they aren't brothers by blood, the feeling is close enough.Elementary, Middle, High school.Looking back, these two do indeed share a deep bond.\"Eh?\"Wei Wen suddenly looks forward.\"Feng, look, it's the one you have a crush on!\"\"Hm?\" Luo Feng also looks, and only sees the ponytailed girl with jeans and a white polo T-shirt out of the entire crowd.Luo Feng's heart skips a beat.A name swept across his heart -- Xu Xin!Luo Feng's crush on Xu Xin: Those who know of this secret are small in number, but good bro Wei Wen naturally knew ages ago.During his first year of high school, Luo Feng and Xu Xin were in the same grade. The first time Luo Feng saw Xu Xin, he felt like there was something bright in front of him.That said, during class time, with Luo Feng sitting in the back, for some reason, cannot control himself: he unknowingly looks towards Xu Xin's back. Just looking silently.He is satisfied with just looking at Xu Xin's back.Since the classes were scrambled again in the second year, he and Xu Xin weren't in the same grade anymore. However, every time Luo Feng sees Xu Xin, he cannot keep his eyes off her.\"There is only one month left until exams.\" Luo Feng whispered to himself. \"I had no courage and no time for romance in the past. In the final month, everyone is frantically reviewing, and Xu Xin wants to better herself. How can she distract herself with romance? It is the same for me, I cannot lose focus, or I will regret it for the rest of my life.\"\"Whatever, this love... I'll just make it a memory.\"Romance....Is bitter. The flower hasn't even bloomed and yet has already withered.Luo Feng just wants to silently put all of this at the bottom of his heart.\"You had your chance to go after her. Now that there's only one month left.\" Wei Wen shakes his head. \"I'm afraid you'll never see her again. In the future, it'll be too late to even regret.\"\"Wei Wen\" Luo Feng shakes his head. \"Stop. Without achieving the title of \"Fighter\", I will not distract myself with romance.\"\"Bro, you're quite cruel!\"Wei Wen raises his thumb. \" 'Fighter' ? In our entire school of 5000 people, not one was able to achieve that rank. You dare say that if you don't achieve the rank of 'Fighter', you won't \"distract yourself with romance?\" Cow, you cow!\"\"Hm?\" Luo Feng glances at a group of five in the crowd outside the gate. \"Zhang Hao Bai?\"In the group of students outside the gate, there are five people who are very eye-catching, whose leader is at least 180 cm, wearing a white T-shirt, white and long pants, and huge chest muscles. The four people surrounding him, whether it was brawniness or a scar on their face, were just as fearsome. And that white shirted teenager in Zhi-An section's 3rd High School is indeed one of the three with the title of \"Elite\" -- Zhang Hao Bai.\"Luo Feng\" snorted Zhang Hao Bai.If you ask Zhang Hao Bai who he hates most in this entire high school, the answer will clearly be Luo Feng!Since one out of the three who have earned the title of \"Elite\" is a girl, just the two of those boys are \"Elite\" title holders!Also, Zhang Hao Bai comes from a rich background while Luo Feng is just a regular person, living in a cheap, rented home.In grades-- Luo Feng is way ahead of Zhang Hao Bai!In strength-- Both Luo Feng and Zhang Hao Bai have earned the title of \"Elite\", but Luo Feng once challenged three high schoolers consecutively and beat them until they couldn't even get back up. And within these three, one of them was Zhang Hao Bai. He even got a tooth beat out of him that time!And for conditions at home, clearly Zhang Hao Bai has the money!A good background, but comparing grades and strength, Luo Feng is far superior. In school, whenever someone compliments Zhang Hao Bai, someone would usually bring up Luo Feng to compare!Resentment!The resentment that Zhang Hao Bai holds toward Luo Feng is great.\"Let's go\" Zhang Hao Bai licked his tooth, which had a faint sense of pain. That time he was beat until his mouth was full of blood and lost a tooth.\"This Zhang Hao Bai, ever since that time in the dojo, is much more well behaved after receiving a beating. He won't ever mess with you again.\" Wei Wen said towards Luo Feng as he watched the group of five get farther and farther.Zhang Hao Bai?Luo Feng has never concerned himself with such a person.\"I would rather deal with less than more\" said Luo Feng as he walked home with Wei Wen.On the way home.[drip, drip] on the street. The car's horn sounded. As of now, all the cars use electric energy, so at least there will be no smell of gasoline on the street.\"Wei Wen, there is one more month until the exam. During this month, let's put forth our best effort.\" Luo Feng and Wei Wen walked on the street.\"At that dojo there, we can relax temporarily. Do some restorative training every day, while mainly concentrating on culture studies. Our twelve years of work were for this exam.\"\"Yea, twelve years of culture studies. This exam determines our fate.\" Wei Wen also sighed. \"Exams, Exams. Just like an army of ten thousand horses crossing a wooden bridge*\"*AKA pain in the neck\"Yup.\" Luo Feng nodded.His home conditions aren't very good, even though he has the title of \"Elite\". No matter how poor his culture grade is, he can always get a job of \"Elite Bodyguard\" and easily earn a yearly salary of 20 to 30 thousand dollars. However, will Luo Feng be satisfied with just a job of being a bodyguard?......At this time, around a thousand meters above Zhi-An region.A large, black-crowned golden eagle was flying past the city. It's body was around twenty meters long, like a huge fighter jet, the feathers of its body had a cold, metallic luster; the feathers on its head were a secluded black, like a black crown. Its huge talons were also golden.A pair of sharp, blue, glowing eyes looked down upon the human city, hiding a sliver of killing intent.\"BOOM!\"The black-crowned golden eagle, who was already flying super fast, suddenly increased its speed exponentially, breaking through the sound barrier within a moment, reaching an appalling speed. At the same time, an extremely high pitched sound erupted from within the mouth of the eagle. The frightening shockwave, which could be seen to the naked eye, spread rapidly downwards.At Zhi-An's region's Zi-Tian road's intersection, Luo Feng was waiting for the red light with Wei Wen.Suddenly--[AHN]An ear piercing howl suddenly arose, but this was not quite so like thunder. Thunder's sound is great and deafening. But this sound was ear piercing, Luo Feng felt a slight pain in his ear drums, with some wrinkles of uncomfort arising on his forehead. Many people on the street were already covering their ears.\"That's the cry of a bird.\" said Luo Feng as looked up towards the sky.\"Hm?\" surprised Luo Feng.Under the shock of the ear piercing howl, a huge piece of glass in a skyscraper on the neighboring street let out a deep [KA~~~ KA~~~] sound.Lots of glass cracked open, and dozens of glass fell from the high sky. Some smashed against the pedestrian path, or hit people, or even smashed against the lights on the street.[PAI!] [PENG!] [PIPA (crackling noises)!] .....There were bursting noises for a while.And one of the glass fell against a streetlight that was right next to Luo Feng.\"Wah!\" Wei Wen rapidly stepped back two steps, dodging a piece of shattered glass.And one of the glass shattered against the ground and a piece was flying straight towards Luo Feng like a knife.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng saw out of the corner of his eye.However, there was no dodging. He just stood there calmly. In an instant, his right hand, like lightning, caught the piece of glass that was flying towards him.The piece of glass reflected Luo Feng's look. He tapped it twice and then randomly threw it. Like a hidden weapon, the piece of glass flew straight towards a far away trash can and accurately went inside the opening.On the street, the cars that were affected at first quickly went back to normal. And the people on the street were having a discussion. Some unfortunate ones were injured, but most of them had no injury at all.\"What strength.\" Luo Feng looked towards the sky.\"So much power in just one howl. It must've been a powerful beast. Wei Wen, weren't you good with beasts? Do you know what kind of beast this is?\"Wei Wen squinted; a light of excitement was within in the slit of his eyes.\"Feng, there is a defense system 500 meters above this city. This beast was definitely flying above 500 meters. Even with such distance, it's howl could still have so much power. And regular beasts wouldn't even dare howl above a human city!\"\"With such strength and arrogance, and according to the sound... If I'm correct, this should be one of the terrifying \"black crowned eagles!\" said Wei Wen solemnly.\"Black crowned eagle?\" Luo Feng's eyes flashed.Of course he has heard of the infamous black crowned eagle.\"The black crowned eagle is ranked three out of the Diao species monsters.\" Wei Wen's eyes shined.\"A grown black crowned eagle's body is around 21 meters in length. Its wingspan is around 36 meters and its flight speed could reach up to 3.9 mach, which is 3.9 times the speed of sound. Using 340 m/s as the speed of sound, that is 1326 meters per second, which is 4774 kilometers in an hour.\"Luo Feng knew that the black crowned eagle was powerful, but once he heard the extreme speed of 1326 m/s, he held his breath.One second, which is just one blink, and it's already a thousand meters away.\"The black crowned eagle's feathers are even harder than diamond. It probably is as tough as a third-grade Ke Lei alloy.\" Wei Wen excitedly added.\"There are videos online. The black crowned eagle has followed hordes and met armies. It has received fire from a 20mm fire-god cannon. A fire-god cannon could shoot 7000 bullets per second. 7000 bullets per second is a stream of bullets! And each bullet could pierce through a 50mm thick steel plate. However... even under the fire-god cannon's barrage, the barrage couldn't even hit one feather off of the black crowned eagle.\"\"After that, a mysterious martial artist, holding a Ke Lei alloy battle knife, made a stream of light and cut the black crowned eagle in half!\" Wei Wen passionately said.Luo Feng's heart was also beating faster.That video was spread around all over the place, so he has seen it too.\"The title of fighter, I will definitely achieve it some day... I want to become like that senior*, able to hold a battle knife and cut open monsters like the black crowned eagle and the powerful devil gorilla.\" Luo Feng thought to himself in his heart. Every teenager has this dream, so of course it is Luo Feng's dream too!*Senior like upperclassman not old man.However, according to the internet, that mysterious powerful fighter who cut the black crowned eagle in half, is internationally in the top 100; a super fighter!\"Feng, Feng, what are you doing? We're already home\" Wei Wen shouted.From this, Luo Feng emerged from his deep thought, looking at the sector made up of a lot of tube-shaped buildings. --Small South Coast sector \u04bb The government built this small, cheap rental area. And Luo Feng has been living in this area for 18 years.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: RRTranslator: Translation NationEditor: Translation NationThe southern sector is primarily used as a cheap rental area. It's packed to its limits and each of the apartments are like huge, square concrete poles and are built with no consideration to sun's exposure.Luo Feng's home is on the 32nd floor out of the 36 floors in a certain apartment.\"Feng, wanna go to the dojo tonight?\" Wei Wen says as he heads toward another apartment.\"I have to go out for some family education matters tonight. After that's done, I might go to the dojo. Don't wait for me tonight.\" Luo Feng smiles and waves his hand and then flies up the staircase; each of Luo Feng's step covering four stair steps. Like a speeding panther, Luo Feng reached the second story within two blinks.Third floor, Fourth floor...\"Step! Step!\"Even while sprinting, Luo Feng is still extremely flexible, having enough time to make way for other residents on the staircase.\"Feng, out of school?\"\"Yea, Uncle Wang.\" Luo Feng's breathing pattern is not affected at all. As an 'Elite' member, this speed of climbing is no different from a relaxing walk.To the vast majority of the residents opinions', no elevator was built in the building. If an elevator was built, then the residents' rental fee would be increased. As of now, to many of the residents, climbing up a few dozen stories is very easy.To them, building a elevator in the building is just a waste.Since electricity is expensive and the city's defense system is electric-powered, the entire country needs electricity.32nd floor!On the 32nd floor, there are eight families, and Luo Feng's is one of them.\"Kacha!\" Holding the key, Luo Feng opens the door.\"Brother, is that you?\" A sound came within the home.\"Yup\" Luo Feng closes the door. At a glance, Luo Feng's home consists of one room and one living room, the area being 36 ping*.*A \"ping\" is approximately 3.306 square meters.Ever since the beginning of his memory, he has lived here with his brother and parents, a family of four, in this 36 ping place.\"Hua, what are you reading?\" Luo Feng heads toward the balcony.On the balcony, a skinny, sickly white teenager sits on a wheelchair, holding an english book. When Feng saw that, he laughed, \"Oh, is that 'Pulaisi' the investing expert? Within the investing experts, isn't the stock god 'Bafeite' the most famous?\"Towards investments and stock, Luo Feng understands nothing.\"Bafeite isn't really suited for me. Also, Pulaisi's theories and thoughts are closer to my own ideals, so I can learn more from them.\" The skinny teenager raised his head and let out a small smile.\"You continue reading.\" Luo Feng laughed.Inadvertently, Luo Feng glanced at his younger brother's legs and felt a pain in his heart... During his younger years, his younger brother's legs were crushed by a car. Everything below his thigh was crushed, which crippled him. As a cripple, he faces immense pressure under living in the current society. Even his education can only be taught through long-distance internet lessons.Since he hasn't been exposed to any sunlight for a long duration of time, his brother's face is a sickly white, as if he's sick.And.... he doesn't have many friends, since he is a bit introverted.\"Mom and Dad's salary aren't high and they have to raise me and my brother, and my brother is even crippled... the burden on our family is too large, so we can only live in this cheap rental home.\"\"I have to change the destiny of our home!\"Luo Feng thinks to his heart.\"I have a crush on Xu Xin, and yet I haven't made any moves, haven't tried to start a relationship\"\"According to the law, one can marry at 18 years old, so lots of people have relationships during high school and marry when they graduate. Those who haven't had relationships in high school are few within few. How come I don't have one?\"\"Because, I don't have time to waste on romance! My family isn't rich, so I don't have an amazing teacher's guidance. I can only depend on myself for everything.\" Luo Feng's gaze lands on the living room's old sofa, which could also act as a bed. \"This many years, a family of four, just in this house of one room and one living room. My brother and I are in the only room, while after all these years, my parents sleep on the living room's sofa...\"\"I will definitely let my family live in a huge house, a huge house with an elevator.\"\"Let dad and Mom sleep on a huge bed.\"\"Let my brother not have to struggle so much when going down the stairs.\"\"The house must have a huge window so the sunlight can completely shine through!.\"These words have been repeated through Luo Feng's mind countless times, which is why he is so hard working.So\u2500\u2500He became one of the three 'Elite' members in the #3 high school and is the only one out of the three who has an average family. The other two are extremely wealthy......\"Huahua~~\" From the faucet's unending stream, it filled up the electric kettle very quickly.\"Chichi......\" Plugging in the electric kettle, Luo Feng sat on the sofa with a history textbook in home, continuously memorizing the important parts of the book.Suddenly\u2500\u2500\"Di!\"The kettle's water has boiled. Luo Feng puts down his book and pours the water into an insulating bottle. He also poured it into a large plastic cup and placed it on the table.\"AD 2026, the battle of Hong Ze happened in the Hong Ze lake... Yup, year 2026.\" Luo Feng memorized historical events one by one. Out of his regular education, Luo Feng is best at math. However, he is most interested in history. Because everytime he sees the 21st century's history.....He feels uneasy.This is the history of human reformation!\"Hua.\" Luo Feng walks towards his brother.\"Yes, brother?\" Younger Brother Luo Hua puts down the book in his hands.\"I have highlighted the 139 important parts in this book, quiz me a bit.\" Luo Feng hands the history textbook in his hand. Luo Hua listened and laughed. \"Sure, I rarely get the chance to quiz you. Brother, listen up, I'm going to give a question. If you get it wrong, it would be embarrassing.\"\"Ask away.\" Luo Feng laughs, sitting on the couch.\"There was one man who slayed the 'Tiger head dragon' and saved hundreds of thousands of people, which let thousands of them successfully transfer to the Jiang Nan base. Who is the hero? From where? How old was he when he died?\" \"What exact date did this happen?\" Luo Hua asked as he flipped through the book.\"The hero was 'Dong Nan Bao' who was granted a four star hero medal by the country. He's Yuan Jiang Tai Xing. He died when he was 39 years old. This happened... should be AD 2018...\" Luo Feng raised his eyebrows.Luo Hua continued asking, \"The exact date is AD 2018, what month, what day?\"\"Um.. I think it was...\" Luo Feng said hesitantly, \"June 18th.\"\"Haha, you got the first question wrong.\" Luo Hua shaked his head, \"Dong Nan Bao is indeed from Yuan Jiang Tai Xing and died when he was 39 years old. However, this happened on AD 2018, June 16th.\"\"Ah!\"Luo Feng hit his head and laughed bitterly. \"I get 16 and 18 mixed up all the time, continue asking.\"\"Okay, listen carefully, second question.\" Luo Hua was clearly excited. \"AD 2013 in...\".....The two brothers asked and answered, and time flew by quickly.\"I already asked half the questions in this book. I asked 68 questions and you got 63 right and 5 wrong.\" Luo Hua raised his head and looked at the clock hanging on the wall. \"Dad and Mom are going to be back soon. I'll ask you one last question and ask you the other half some other time.\"\"Last question? Okay, ask away.\" Luo Feng's concentration increased.\"This question, is very basic. Review the important events of the 'Da Nie Pan'* period.\" asked Luo Hua.*Da Nie Pan's pan character was slightly different, but this basically means Nirvana/Grand Nirvana, or at least hints at it. I will call it the Grand Nirvana period from now on.Luo Hua had a serious expression, for the Grand Nirvana period was the most important part of the history of human reformation. \"In the beginning of the 21st century, the entire world continued to have several virus outbreaks. AD 2003 was SARS, 2009 was H1N1, and 2013, finally the even more horrifying R-type virus broke out. As the R-type virus spread, it mutated into around twenty different kinds, which made it even more challenging for anti-virals to fight against. As a result, all of the countries of the world had many deaths.\"\"As the medical department advanced, the virus got under control.\"\"However, on AD 2015 January, the R virus mutated into its most horrifying mutation, the one which became known was the RR virus!\"\"In the past, many R virus mutations were spread through body fluids, some which could be spread through water. However, its life span in water is very short. On the other hand, this RR virus could go through body fluid, go through water, and even worse... it could even go through air! With a lifespan of up to three hours in the air!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Jiang-Nan City\u201cRight when the RR disease appeared, it rapidly spread around the world. All forms of life, as long as they needed to breath (whether human or flying beasts), were infected.\u201d\u201cBy the time humans found the existence of the RR disease, it was already too late.\u201d\u201cAfter the infection of the RR disease, the death rate was reaching 30%. In a matter of those three months, excluding the mass deaths of animals, the population of the world dropped by nearly 2 billion!\u201d\u201cThe survivors neared 5 billion, whom all have a natural resistance against the disease.\u201d\u201cDuring these nightmarish three months, the whole planet experienced excruciating pain.\u201d\u201cDuring this process, the 5 billion survivors realized that their bodies have strengthened. Virtually everyone\u2019s power, speed, rate of cell division, and skin toughness have at least doubled! Even an average man could easily surpass the previous world champion in running and weightlifting.\u201d\u201cAnd then\u2026 disaster started!\u201d\u201cThe humans who have lived so comfortably have strengthened so much. The beasts who have survived the RR disease have went through even harsher conditions. In their transformations, their strength has raised surprisingly far beyond humans\u2019. And some of these horrifying beasts got even smarter!\u201d\u201cSeptember, 2015. Starting from the attack of the plethora of organisms in the sea, countless of \u2018beast\u2019 transformed animals started attacking human settlements!\u201d\u201cBlood, madness!\u201d\u201cIn the war between human and beast, the humans have realized that their explosive weapons that they were so proud of only worked on the lower-grade beasts. The stronger flying and crawling beasts had no fear towards the cannons. The bullets couldn\u2019t even scratch their armor! Homing missiles are easily dodged by speedy, quick-reacting beasts.\u201d\u201cEven when humans used nuclear attacks, they shockingly found out\u2026\u201d\u201cThe defense capability of the monsters were too great; only those within the blast radius of the bomb died. The monsters in the surrounding area weren\u2019t killed. The power of the bomb wasn\u2019t as strong as the humans thought it would be. Even though it killed a horde of monsters, the radiation from the bomb gave birth to even more horrifying monsters. The most famous and horrifying monster of that year was the \u2018Crimson Sky Wolf\u2019, which could fly and massacred hundreds of thousands of people. It was at this time people realized\u2026. radiation could actually mutate the monsters!\u201d\u201cAlthough horrifying monsters appeared, powerful warriors also sprung out from the human side. The Crimson Sky Wolf was defeated by a super powerful warrior who could also fly (ranked number 2 internationally: \u2018Thunder Lord\u2019).\u201d\u201cThese warriors saved a large amount of normal civilians in a crucial time. They assisted the army in fighting off the horde of monsters. During this time, many epic stories came about.\u201d\u201cHuman Scientist \u2018KeLuo\u203bDeSenNa\u2019 used materials from the corpses of monsters along with a metal called \u2018Blue Gold\u2019 found on the moon to make a metal alloy even harder than diamond: the Ke Luo Alloy! Given these powerful weapons that could cut through the monsters\u2019 armor, the powerful warriors didn\u2019t have to rely on just their bare hands anymore.\u201dThis portion of history was very clear in Luo Feng\u2019s mind.\u201cDuring the war, a large portion of the city was destroyed.\u201d\u201cIn the WoHuaXia continent, countries were hastily building six major bases to transfer the huge population to. For the warriors\u2026 my country and India have the largest amount! For technology, the United States, European Union, and Russia were leaders.\u201d\u201cSince the number of monsters in the sea are immeasurable, all of the island countries were destroyed!\u201d\u201cEven now, the sea is the monsters\u2019 territory.\u201d\u201cIn the war between humanity and monsters, the only countries that are capable of defending themselves are: India, the United States, the European Union, Russia, and my country. The rest of the countries were destroyed a long time ago. In the critical moment, the United Earth Federation was formed, with the five countries as its nucleus. The United Forces of the United Earth Federation helped create many human bases all around the world.\u201dLuo Feng marveled.A war that lasted five and a half years, the most horrifying war! In this war, deaths totaled to nearly 10 billion. Only the system maintained by the five countries stayed intact, the rest of the countries\u2019 survivors mixed together in various human bases.Until now\u2500\u2500On land, the humans maintain the advantage. But the countless monsters in the sea maintain their control over the sea.\u201cFrom 2013 to 2021, in these eight years, was the Grand Nirvana period of human history!\u201d Luo Feng sat on the couch.[DONG]~~[DONG]~~[DONG]~~[DONG]~~[DONG]The clock\u2019s sound echoed within the house.The clock on the wall rang five times, which signals that it\u2019s currently 5 PM.\u201cThe Grand Nirvana period.\u201d Luo Hua marveled.\u201cBrother, truthfully, I can\u2019t really wrap my head around what the world was like before the Grand Nirvana Period. There were over 200 countries, so how many people were there? Only 7 billion. Some countries would be in grave danger; just one powerful beast would be able to wipe an entire country off the map.\u201dLuo Feng nodded, \u201cWhich is why the whole world is comprised of five powerful countries and 23 cities.\u201dOn the entire planet, there were five countries in total: China, India, the United States of America, the European Union, and Russia. Locations such as South America and Africa made up the 23 cities, or bases.China had six human bases, which are the present\u2019s Six Major Cities.Luo Feng\u2019s home was Yi-An region\u2019s Yang Zhou city, one of the eight parts of Jiang-Nan City.The entire population of Jiang-Nan city neared 200 million. Yang Zhou city of Jiang-Nan City\u2019s Yi-An region had over a million people. Jiang-Nan city base used to be comprised of Yuan Jian Su*. Of course there were also Yuan An Wei*.*These are different kinds of ethnic groups.\u201cSo long ago\u201d Luo Hua looked towards the clock hanging on the wall, \u201cRight now it\u2019s 2056; the Grand Nirvana Period is already more than 30 years into the past. In our society, virtually everyone has to go train in a dojo. Our society is much stronger than it was 30 years ago.\u201dLuo Feng nodded.In 30 years, there definitely was a major increase in powerful warriors along with a steady progression in technology. However, many terrifying monsters have also been born.\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b[KA]The door was opened and a middle-aged couple walked in. The man\u2019s shirt was drenched in sweat and had some paint stains. It was clear he was very tired. The woman, holding a basket containing vegetables and meat, wasn\u2019t very tall.\u201cDad, Mom\u201d Luo Feng immediately rose; they are his parents.Father Luo Hong Guo, Mother Gong Xin Lan.\u201cHaha, Feng, keep reading, keep reading. Don\u2019t bother with me.\u201d Luo Hong Guo laughed. Since his son has exams soon, studying is of utmost importance in Luo Hong Guo\u2019s eyes.Luo Hong Guo lowered his head and saw a large plastic bottle of tap water. The fact that there was always water ready for him everytime he returned warmed his heart. After working all day, he would take this bottle and drink the entire thing in one gulp, letting out a satisfied breath of air.\u201cHurry up and go take a shower, you reek of sweat.\u201d Gong Xin Lan laughed.\u201cHaha\u201d Luo Hong Guo laughed and immediately went to get a change of clothes, headed towards the small corner that served the family for many years as a \u2018bathroom\u2019.Gong Xin Lan laughed and looked at her two sons, \u201cFeng, Hua, today Mom is going to make roasted meat!\u201d\u201cRoasted meat is my favorite!\u201d Luo Hua yelled right away.Luo Feng also laughed. As he watched his mother put on her apron and prepare to cook dinner, Luo Feng was clear\u2026 Mom always went grocery shopping in the evening after her work, since the price for the groceries are much cheaper than the morning\u2019s. However, the groceries wouldn\u2019t be as fresh by then. Luo Feng then glanced at the bathroom, thinking \u201cI must hurry and get the title of \u2018Fighter\u2019 so Mom wouldn\u2019t have to go grocery shopping during the evening and Dad wouldn\u2019t have to go work so much.\u201dIn his heart\u2026..Luo Feng has always wished for his parents to be able to take a break and enjoy the sunlight and good food in peace.\u201cFeng\u201d Luo Hong Guo walked towards Luo Feng after finishing his shower, \u201cDad has something to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Luo Feng looked at his father.Luo Feng laughed a bit, \u201cIt\u2019s like this, Feng. I never asked you what your plans you had for after high school graduation. Could you tell me?\u201d Luo Hong Guo rarely talked about these kinds of matters with his son because he didn\u2019t want to pressure him. He knew that his son worked very hard and has performed very well.Right when Luo Hong Guo said this, Gong Xin Lan\u2019s cooking movements started to slow down a bit. Luo Fengs parents really cared for their son\u2019s future.\u201cDad, I was thinking like this.\u201dLuo Feng added, \u201cAccording to my grades, I\u2019m sure that getting into \u2018Jiang-Nan\u2019s number one military academy\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be difficult. Now that I have earned the dojo\u2019s \u2018Elite\u2019 title, I would be raised as an officer in the military academy. Mom and Dad can enter into the family section of the military.\u201dThere were also different tiers in the military.China, of course, recruited soldiers. However, regular soldiers didn\u2019t receive much. However, for a young man holding the title of \u2018Elite\u2019 and getting into \u2018Jiang-Nan\u2019s number one military academy\u2019, would have intellect and strength. The country would surely focus on such people and give their families a home.For the family of an officer, the conditions would be tens of hundreds of times better than this cheap, rented home.\u201cThen what if you can\u2019t get in that number one military academy?\u201d Luo Hong Guo said, \u201cFeng, don\u2019t give yourself too much pressure.\u201d\u201cThere are two main military academies in Jiang-Nan city. If anything goes wrong in your exams and you are unable to get into the best academy, there is absolutely no problem with going to the second one.\u201d Luo Feng clearly understood his grades: normally, he can score around 50 points higher than the average Bachelor. For the second military academy, he only has to reach the average.In the tests today, there are only two types: Bachelors and Specialists. There is also only one dividing line. Those above that line are Bachelors, and those below are Specialists.\u201cIn the second military academy, having the title of \u2018Elite\u2019, I would also be nurtured as an officer. There wouldn\u2019t be too much of a difference in treatment.\u201d Luo Feng laughed.To become a Bachelor\u2026Only two out of ten people could do it.However, for a high school student, only one out of a thousand people could achieve the title of \u2018Elite\u2019.\u201cYup, if you got the confidence then that\u2019s great. However, Feng, don\u2019t give yourself too much pressure. Me and your mom just need a stable life, that\u2019s all.\u201d Luo Hong Guo nodded his head slightly, \u201cThis kid, just gives himself too much pressure.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201d Luo Feng laughed, \u201cI don\u2019t really have much pressure. Since I\u2019m young, I just have a bit more energy and motivation.\u201dLuo Feng says that out loud, but in his heart: \u201cMom, Dad, brother, after my exams, you will soon be able to enjoy a good life. After I achieve the rank of \u2018Fighter\u2019, you guys won\u2019t have to live so bitterly.\u201d\u201cHurry and get the bowls and chopsticks and move the dishes onto the table. Dinner is ready!\u201d Gong Xin Lan laughed and urged.\u201cAight.\u201d Luo Hong Guo laughed and stood up to get the bowls and chopsticks.\u201cThe vegetables smell great!\u201d Luo Feng sniffed the pot and helped carry the dishes.\u201d\u201cI smell the smell of roasted meat, yay~~~\u201d Luo Hua shouted excitedly and moved his wheelchair towards the table.A family of four, enjoying their time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Luo Feng\u2019s skillAfter dinner, Luo Feng\u2019s mom and dad brought Luo Hua to walk outside while Luo Feng went to tutor.Around 6 PM, the sky was already about to become completely dark.\u201cThis tutoring job will have to be on hold soon.\u201d Luo Feng was like a leopard, flexibly moving through the alleys. There was a dead end in front, but Luo Feng\u2019s entire body flew in the air. He jumped over two meters high, lightly tapping the top of the wall with his left hand, and fell into the next alley.Sprinting was his warm up before tutoring.At this time, Luo Feng\u2019s speed was 15 meters per second, or 54 km/hour, which wasn\u2019t even his top speed. However, it was able to serve its purpose as warm up.[Light panting]\u201cOne more month until exams, and then I will be able to put tutoring on hold. I earned twenty thousand dollars during this half year of tutoring.\u201d Having the title of \u2018Elite\u2019, it was easy for him to find a tutoring job, teaching someone the basics.The salary was 100 dollars per hour.For five days a week, he taught for one hour a day. In other words, his monthly salary would be around 2000 dollars.\u201cDad works hard all day and only earns around 2-3 thousand dollars a month. I just tutor for an hour and earn so much more than him\u2026 This is the difference between a normal person and someone with a title! If I am able to become a \u2018Fighter\u2019, then the difference would be shocking!\u201d Luo Feng looked ahead of him and saw a cargo truck blocking the road.However, Luo Feng didn\u2019t slow down at all. He suddenly jumped up to a height of 2-3 meters high and then ran two steps on the side of the wall. He then dropped back down and continued running forwards.After that\u2500\u2500Luo Feng has already ran to the outer part of a quiet residential area.\u201cHere is where Mom and Dad should be living.\u201d Luo Feng stopped and eyed the area in front of him. The density of the homes in the area was lower and there were man-made pools. There were tons of foliage and every floor of each building had its own garden, even the higher floors.Other than the tall residential homes, there were also villas.Know that\u2500\u2500As of now, there are a total of six major bases in China, which are the six major cities. Each city has an astonishingly large population. For example, Jiang-Nan city\u2019s population is nearly 200 million. Naturally, there is very little land. Things like villas are very rare and expensive. The large mansions that take up even more space cost an enormous amount of money.\u201cI\u2019m going to #1801 of the 18th building\u201d said Luo Feng to the guardsman outside the area.\u201cWait a moment\u201d The guardsman pressed a video-telephone number and shot the camera at Luo Feng. A voice from the video-telephone said, \u201cIt\u2019s Feng, let him in\u201d\u201cAlright sir\u201d The guardsman let him in.\u2026\u2026One hour later, Feng walked out the area.\u201cYup, done with tutoring. Now I\u2019ll go to the dojo and see if there has been any increase in my strength.\u201d\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203bThe \u2018Dojo of Limits\u2019, the largest dojo on earth created by the strongest fighter \u2018Hong\u2019.There are dojos scattered all around the world.[Di]Luo Feng entered the dojo after scanning his student identification card at the door.One \u2018Dojo of Limits\u2019 is like an entrenched gigantic monster: the area it covers is even larger than a high school. The main gate of the dojo is big enough to let ten cars in. Inside the dojo, there were three large silver-white structures with an airship-like style.\u201cBrother!*\u201d*This brother is one used in respect, not blood related. All the \u201cbrothers\u201d for the rest of the chapter will be like this too.\u201cGreetings Brother\u201dOn the lawn of the interior of the Dojo were large amounts of dojo members. These members saw Luo Feng\u2019s \u2018Elite\u2019 identification on his chest and respected him.Inside the dojo, the three structures were separated by level: one for the beginner members, one for the intermediate members, and one for the elite members.The elite member building\u2019s first and second floors are large teaching halls, large enough to hold a few thousand people. The teachers of the dojo taught in this hall. There were around 30-40 thousand members of this particular dojo.You can only become a member of the dojo starting from the age of 16. After the age of 30, you are prohibited from coming back to the dojo, since you will be wasting valuable teaching resources.There were a couple hundred \u2018elite\u2019 students, most being around 20 years old.However, Luo Feng was only 18.\u201cGreetings Brother\u201dLuo Feng walked along as he heard people greet him. He entered the third floor of the elite building, which only elite members could enter.The third floor was a couple hundred meters long and wide; a large training center. At this time, there were a couple dozen people.\u201cCrazy*\u201d*Not the \u201cmad\u201d kind of crazy. This is just a nickname incorporating the Feng of Luo Feng (crazy = Feng Zi)\u201cHey, come Crazy.\u201dAs he entered the large training center, all of the \u2018elite\u2019 members warmly greeted him.\u201cBrother Wang, Brother Yang, Sister Li\u201d Luo Feng happily shouted back. As he looked at these people, his heart warmed. These few dozen people were all over 20 years of age. Of course, the elite members of the \u2018Dojo of Limits\u2019 of Zhi An section weren\u2019t just these people. In total, there were over a hundred of them, but most of them were too lazy to come since there isn\u2019t a teacher to teach.The only people who would come to the training center are those who are poor and without anywhere else to train.The rich people all have their own individual training center.So\u2500\u2500Almost all of these people live in cheap rental homes. Since they are all categorized as poor people, they naturally formed a clique. Luo Feng\u2019s nickname of \u2018Crazy\u2019 came from the time when he consecutively challenged and defeated three rich elite members out of anger.\u201cI wonder how much my strength improved from the last half month of training.\u201dLuo Feng walked towards the \u2018Fist Strength Tester Machine\u2019 at the corner of the training hall, where there were two of them side by side. Whether you were a beginner, intermediate, or an elite member, you had to test the strength of your punch. Even the test to become a \u2018Fighter\u2019 has strength* tests.*All strength tests refer to fist strength.Luo Feng took in a deep breath and completely relaxed his body. Suddenly, his gaze concentrated. His body tensed, like a lazy lion getting ready for action. His spine tensed like a bow string. His feet supported his waist, which strengthened Luo Feng\u2019s right fist. His punch was like a cannonball, shooting across an arc\u2500\u2500[DA]Luo Feng\u2019s fist smashed against the machine.The machine shook violently.Soon enough, a number appeared on the machine\u2019s screen\u2500\u2500 \u201c809 kg\u201d\u201cNot bad, crazy. Got past the 800 kg milestone\u201d A man with a height taller than 1.9 meters who was a bit lean yet buff laughed and clapped. This buff man had a savage scar on his face.\u201cBrother Yang\u201d Luo Feng laughed, \u201cwhen compared to you, this is nothing. Brother Yang, could you help me turn on the \u2018Speed Tester Machine\u2019?\u201d\u201cBrother Yang, named Yang Wu, is currently ranked top three within the elite members in the \u2018Dojo of Limits\u2019. If it wasn\u2019t for his speed, he would\u2019ve cleared the \u2018Fighter Preliminary Exams\u2019 a long time ago.For an elite member to become a fighter.He has to pass two exams\u2500\u2500The first exam is the \u2018Fighter Fitness\u2019 exam, or the Prospective Fighter exam. Once you pass that, you have proved that your fitness level has reached the standard of a \u2018fighter\u2019. At this time, you have become a \u2018Prospective Fighter\u2019.The second exam is a \u2018Fighter Combat\u2019 exam.Just having the body fitness doesn\u2019t grant you the privilege of becoming a fighter. Only by defeating an actual monster in an actual fight will you be able to achieve the title of \u2018Fighter\u2019.\u201cTesting speed? Alright.\u201d Yang Wu laughed as he walked towards the machine and turned it on.[KA]The machine turned on and lighted up.Luo Feng adjusted his breathing and stood on the track, which was 60 meters long. Close to the speed testing machine was a speed testing region.Luo Feng exploded forwards![WHOOSH]In a blink of an eye, Luo Feng has accelerated to his maximum speed. His feet pedaled with strength, increasing his sprinting power. His body was like an arrow leaving a bow and flying across the runway, bringing along with him a gust of wind. Luo Feng flew past the speed testing region. After that, he naturally slowed down and stopped.\u201cHow fast?\u201d Luo Feng laughed as he walked towards the machine.\u201cHeh, crazy, looks like you improved a bit since last time. Not bad, not bad\u201d Brother Yang, with a face of astonishment, looked at the number displayed on the speed testing machine, \u201cCome look for yourself\u201dLuo Feng looked over to the machine and the number displayed was\u2500\u2500 \u201c23.8 m/s\u201d\u201cNot bad\u201dLuo feng wasn\u2019t that happy though, since there were three parts to the Fighter Fitness exam, or the \u2018Prospective Fighter\u2019 exam: Strength, speed, and reaction speed. For reaction speed, Luo Feng was naturally gifted and has barely reached the level that a fighter requires.However\u2500\u2500In the prospective fighter exam, the passing mark for strength is \u2500\u2500 900 kg!For speed, the passing mark is\u2500\u2500 25 m/s! Or 100 meters every 4 seconds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Different Choices\u201cThe stronger you get, the harder it is to improve\u201d Luo Feng contemplated, \u201cFor me to raise my speed from 23.8 m/s to 25 m/s would probably take around one year. For my strength to improve from 809 kg to 900 kg would probably take even longer. I would probably have to wait until after I get into college to achieve the title of \u2018Fighter\u2019.\u201d\u201cIf, if\u2026 I enter a coma again, my body fitness level might reach what a \u2018Fighter\u2019 requires\u201dOf course, this kind of coma isn\u2019t one you enter when someone beats you unconscious, but when you enter one from an extremely painful headache.Luo Feng has a headache disorder.Every so often Luo Feng gets a headache. However, he is usually able to bear with the pain until it passes. Occasionally, it would hurt so much that he would enter a coma.Luo Feng has entered a coma twice so far.When Luo Feng was 8 years old and his brother\u2019s legs were crushed by a car, he was so sad that he got a headache. At the same time, his heartbeat started to rapidly rise and his blood circulation speed rose to an alarming rate. Soon after he felt like his heart was about to beat out of his chest, he entered a coma.Another time was when Luo Feng was 12 years old and his mother was re-hospitalized. Afraid of losing his mother, Luo Feng panicked and got an extremely painful headache. Like before, his heartbeat rapidly rose and he entered a coma.After two comas, Luo Feng\u2019s family frequently brought him to the hospital for check ups. However, no illness was identified. Even in this age, the brain is still a mystery to medicine.\u201cHowever, the two comas have increased my body strength by many times\u201d Luo Feng anticipated, \u201c8 years old, 12 years old, after I woke up from the comas, my strength, speed, and reaction speed clearly improved. Because of this, I was able to skip right past the \u2018Intermediate\u2019 exam in the dojo and achieve the \u2018Intermediate\u2019 title. Thanks to my genes, I was able to achieve the \u2018Elite\u2019 title at the age of 17\u201d\u201cIf I enter a coma again, I bet my strength would increase even more!\u201dA coma is actually a symptom caused by your body to protect itself, so it isn\u2019t entirely a bad thing.\u201cMy head would hurt until its limit and my heartbeat would speed up until its limit\u201dLuo Feng lowered his head and looked at the watch on his wrist. This watch had a \u2018Pulse meter\u2019 function.\u201cEven after sprinting like crazy, my heart beat wouldn\u2019t go above 120 times a minute\u201d Luo Feng watched his watch, \u201cIf I can reach a rate of 200 times a minute, then that would be great\u201d The premonitions of a coma is an extremely bad headache and a super high pulse.However\u2500\u2500No matter how hard he exercised, he couldn\u2019t get his heartbeat to the rate which a coma would require.\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203bWithin the dojo training hall, scar faced Yang Wu, stood in front of the \u2018Fist Strength Tester\u2019 machine. However, he didn\u2019t seem very serious; he simply punched the tester a few times with both hands. A repeated [PENG!] [PENG!] [PENG!] sounded as he punched the machine. Soon after that, a few numbers were displayed on the screen.\u2500\u2500\u201d956kg, 912kg, 936kg, 981kg\u2026\u2026\u201dYang Wu punched a couple dozen times in one breath before stopping.Luo Feng, who was watching on the sidelines, couldn\u2019t help but admire. His full power could only amount to 809 kg, but Brother Yang could unleash a flurry of fists with such power. For all of them to just pass the 700 kg mark would already be plenty.\u201cBrother Yang, if only one of my full-power punches could be as strong as one of your random ones, then that would be great\u201d Luo Feng laughed.\u201cYou, \u201d Yang Wu walked towards Luo Feng and laughed as he hit him on the shoulder, \u201cyou\u2019re only 19 this year, or 18 right now. When I was your age, I was only an intermediate member. With the rate at which you\u2019re improving\u2026 you would achieve the body fitness level required for the rank of \u2018Fighter\u2019 within two years for sure. Heh, a 20 year old fighter, how envious.\u201dLuo Feng laughed.The dojo only recruited students from age 16 to 30 because this is the period where one grows the fastest. This means that a person could enter the rankings more quickly and lead to even greater strength in the future. Luo Feng became an elite member at the age of 17, which many admired.\u201cOh yea, Crazy, you got high school exams right? What\u2019re ya gonna do after them?\u201d Yang Wu laughed.\u201cI will have to prepare for military academy\u201d Luo Feng let out a small laugh, \u201cthe average person becomes a basic level officer in the normal army. However, I should be able to get into the Special Forces after graduation without a problem.\u201d\u201cOh\u201dYang Wu listened and curled his lip, \u201cEntering a military academy is good but\u2026 I feel like your freedom is limited there. After you graduate from the academy and enter the special forces, you\u2019ll have to follow all of the rules. I would never be able to handle that; better for me to become a free fighter.\u201d\u201cA free fighter is great\u201d Luo Feng nodded, \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t want my parents to worry. It is much safer to enroll in an academy, graduate, and then join the army than to become a free fighter.\u201dA fighter usually has four paths they can choose from.The first path: Join the army and become a part of it. It\u2019s safer and the country wouldn\u2019t easily let the fighter take risks. The country would also give the fighter\u2019s family many benefits, so the fighter would have no regrets.The second path: Join a dojo. The restrictions of a dojo are broader and the community is more loose. Since the \u2018Dojo of Limits\u2019 was created by the strongest man on earth (\u2018Hong\u2019), there are quite a few benefits in becoming a \u2018fighter\u2019 in that dojo. Since the administration isn\u2019t as strict, there is more freedom too.The third path: Join a large business, some family, or some major political power, and become a thug.The fourth path: Join the mercenary corps, which would endanger your life all the time. At the same time, it grants the most freedom out of all four paths.TL note: A free fighter doesn\u2019t pertain to any of the above paths.\u201cEntering the army is safe, but I wouldn\u2019t want to live my days without any freedom\u201d Yang WU nodded, \u201cThis year, I think I can pass the \u2018Prospective Fighter\u2019 exam. After I pass, I\u2019ll immediately sign up for the \u2018Fighter Combat\u2019 exam and work hard to become a fighter.\u201dLuo Feng\u2019s eyes flashed: \u201cBrother Yang, you\u2019re confident that you can pass the prospective fighter exam?\u201d\u201cHaha\u201d Yang Wu laughed, \u201cI have reached the requirements for strength and reaction speed a long time ago. My weak point is speed. However, if I do well, I can barely reach 25 m/s. I\u2019ll work hard these few days and I should be able to pass the exam by the time I take it.\u201d\u201cCongratulations, Brother Yang.\u201d Luo Feng was happy for Brother Yang, since he worked so hard to become a fighter for so many years. \u201cBrother Yang, what will you do after you become a fighter?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019d join the Dojo of Limits\u201d Brother Yang laughed, \u201cThe Dojo of Limits has a very loose system and is scattered all around the world. Many previous fighters improved themselves in these dojos. Also, when I feel like taking a break, I can go out and kill some monsters. Quite free if you ask me.\u201dLuo Feng nodded.\u201cCrazy\u201d Yang Wu looked at Luo Feng, \u201cYou\u2019re quite crazy inside your bones. I\u2019m pretty sure that you are very suited to walk the path of a free fighter. Join a dojo, how free is that? And the Dojo of Limits would help us out a lot.\u201d\u201cI\u2026.\u201d Luo Feng hesitated.Yang Wu saw what was happening, shaked his head, and laughed, \u201cCrazy, free fighters frequently fight for their lives and train on the border between life and death. It\u2019s a bit more dangerous! But at the same time, because you are constantly fighting for your life, it\u2019s the fastest way to increase your strength! You see, no matter where, most of the strongest fighters are all free fighters.\u201d\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203bNight time, the streetlights shine.As Luo Feng leaves the Dojo of Limits, he reflects on his conversation with Yang Wu as he walks alone.\u201cThere are actually only two paths that suit me\u201d Luo Feng thought to himself, \u201cOne is to enroll in the military academy, graduate, and then join the special forces. Next is to become a famous fighter in the Dojo of Limits and then kill monsters freely.\u201d\u201cThe safest out of these two paths is to enter the army. It\u2019s safer and benefits my family. Even if I die, the country would take good care of my loved ones.\u201d\u201cBecoming a free fighter and living on the border between life and death would increase my strength the fastest. I can exchange the monsters I kill for a huge sum of money. This path\u2026. dangerous. Rapid increase in skill, quick money, free, but the only drawback is the danger.\u201d Luo Feng contemplated. In fact, he has been thinking about this ever since he started his senior year of high school.\u201cMy parents have two sons in total and my younger brother is already handicapped. If I become a free fighter and die in battle, how will my parents survive?\u201dLuo Hua needs someone to take care of him.Mom and Dad are already quite old. If I die, what will happen to them?\u201cGuess I\u2019ll enroll in a military academy.\u201d\u201cAfter I join the special forces, I\u2019ll be able to learn \u2018Militaristic Martial Arts\u2019 which, combined with my \u2018Ultimate Martial Arts\u2019 from the Dojo of Limits, should increase my strength. In the army, I can also train myself! Even if I die, I\u2019ll die as a fighter, so my country would give my parents pension every month.\u201d After thinking about his parents, Luo Feng decided to pick the military academy.However\u2026..Not just anybody can enter a military academy. Your grades have to meet the standard, so everything depends on June\u2019s exams.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: ExamsOne month before the exams, Luo Feng put almost all of his concentration into reviewing. As he took his practice exams, his confidence started increasing.\u201cI easily have a 90% chance of getting into Jiang-Nan\u2019s number one military academy\u201dThis was what Luo Feng thought.\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203bJune 7th marks the beginning of exams. China\u2019s exams go from June 7th-9th, which is the same time duration as before the Grand Nirvana period.Zhi-An region\u2019s first high school.According to the rules, all of the exams will take place in this high school.\u201cGood luck, my daughter\u201d\u201cNo worries dad\u201d\u201cSweetie, don\u2019t pressure yourself too much\u201d\u2026\u2026Outside of the high school\u2019s gates was a huge, dense mob made up of high school exam takers and their parents. Also standing outside the gates was a row of police holding real, loaded guns.\u201cFeng, be at ease as you take the exam. Even if you don\u2019t get into the top military academy, the runner up is just as fine. So relax!\u201d Luo Hong Guo looked at his son and laughed.\u201cOk\u201d Luo Feng smiled and nodded his head.[DRIP\u2500\u2500DRIP\u2500\u2500] followed a loud car. The car was completely black and had the aura of an aristocrat. It was the newest \u2018Sprinting s600\u2019 and had many police vehicles guarding it. As it approached the gate, the surrounding people made way for it; their gazes all focusing on that one car.The newest \u2018Sprinting S600\u2019 only needed a mere six seconds to accelerate to 100 km/h. Its maximum speed could reach up to 500 km/h. Of course, this alone isn\u2019t much. The \u2018Sprinting S600\u2019 is a brand carried from the Grand Nirvana period. In other words, its history is what makes it so attractive.Only three people came out of the car, and they happily talked with each other as they walked towards the gate.\u201cThe baldie on the left is the Chief of Police in our Zhi-An region\u201d\u201cThe guy on the right is the Board of Education\u2019s head Liu\u201d\u201cThe one in the middle must be the \u2018Fighter\u2019 responsible for making sure the testing areas are safe.\u201d Among the people watching, there is no doubt that most of the gazes landed upon the man in the middle. Their gazes were full of respect, excitement, and curiosity.As of now, the fight between Man and Beast is still going on.The average person is prohibited from leaving the city\u2019s borders. However, fighters are the existence able to fight one on one against a beast. The entire human society is thankful towards them, thanking their hard work and contribution towards humanity. The average person naturally praises them.The fighters are the superhuman group of humanity.\u201cSo that\u2019s a fighter\u201d Luo Hong Guo was also looking at that man, \u201cEvery time there\u2019s an exam, the responsibility of the safety of the grounds almost always falls upon the fighters.\u201d\u201cFighter\u201dLuo Feng looked over. The fighter had an aura that made your heart beat faster. His eyes were like a poisonous snake in a cold forest. He didn\u2019t even smile once as he walked. Towards the Chief of Police and head Liu, he just slightly nodded his head at times. Clearly, he was too lazy to bother with them.\u201cNot too far in the future, I\u2019ll also achieve the rank of \u2018Fighter\u2019!\u201d Luo Feng thought to himself.[KA~~ KA~~]The high school\u2019s large gate slowly opened.Immediately a burst of sound came out: \u201cIt\u2019s time to enter\u201d\u201cFeng, it\u2019s time to go in. Hurry and enter\u201d Luo Hong Guo said right after. Gong Xin Lan also said, \u201cHurry and go. Mom will return home and make food for you. Your dad and brother will wait here until you finish your exam\u201d\u201cOk\u201dLuo Feng smiled and nodded his head.\u201cBrother\u201d Luo Hua sat on his wheelchair and raised his fist. \u201cDo your best!\u201d Luo Hua said smiling.\u201cI\u2019ll do my best!\u201d Luo Feng also raised his fist.As Luo Feng turned his head, everyone headed towards the gate and went through an inspection one by one.\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203bInside the testing classroom, your examination certificate and ID are placed on the top right of your table for the examiner to inspect. After that, the tests were passed down.\u201cYear 2056 Jiang-Nan City High School Science Exam Version A\u201d\u2500\u2500the clearest line at the top of the page\u201cThe first round is science!\u201dLuo Feng scanned the test in front of him until he reached the final few large problems at the end. As if he has seen them before, Luo Feng thought to himself \u201cThese problems aren\u2019t that difficult. If these aren\u2019t difficult enough, my advantage in science would be hard to demonstrate. I guess I can only focus and make sure I don\u2019t lose any points at all.\u201dLuo Feng immediately buried his head and started writing.\u2026\u2026There are three exams in the high school exam: science, liberal arts, and mathematics. Each exam is worth 250 points, leading to a total of 750 points possible.Science refers to physics, chemistry and biology.Liberal Arts refers to language, history, politics, and geography.Mathematics naturally refers to just math.Humanity after the Grand Nirvana period, especially during their battle with the monsters, desperately tried to advance in technology and increase their martial arts skill. Because of this, everyone realized the importance of \u2018mathematics\u2019. Anyone planning to achieve in the fields of computer science, biology, and physics needs to have a strong foundation in mathematics.So\u2500\u2500Mathematics became more important in education. Luo Feng was a bit weak in liberal arts, but had an immense advantage in mathematics.\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203bJune 7th: Science examsJune 8th: Liberal arts examsIn a blink of an eye, it\u2019s already June 9th.\u2026\u2026Inside the testing classroom, the mathematics exam has just been passed down.\u201cAll that\u2019s left is this mathematics exam\u201d Luo Feng took in a deep breath, \u201cThe science exam wasn\u2019t too hard, so I should\u2019ve done pretty well on that. I also performed normally on my liberal arts exam. In other words, my grades for those two tests should be what I usually get. As long as I don\u2019t mess up on this mathematics exam, I can get into Jiang-Nan\u2019s number one military academy for sure.\u201d\u201cI can do this!\u201dAfter encouraging himself, Luo Feng lowered his head and started the exam.There was absolute silence throughout the classroom. Many of the student\u2019s eyebrows started to wrinkle, which showed that the problems were quite difficult. Every year\u2019s high school mathematics exam problems are never easy, as these are the problems that pick out the people to advance humanity\u2019s technology.\u201cThis is pretty hard\u201d Even Luo Feng felt the difficulty, \u201cEven harder than last year\u2019s problems! However\u2026 the harder the better!\u201dIf the problems were easy, those worse than Luo Feng at math would probably be able to get around 220 points. Luo Feng would only be able to get around 230 points, so his advantage isn\u2019t really demonstrated.However, if the problems are hard.Luo Feng would probably be able to score around 210 points, while those worse than him would only be able to manage around 150 points. In this case, Luo Feng\u2019s advantage is clearly shown.[PA!] a breaking sound was heard.The examiner immediately looked towards the sound\u2019s direction, but it was a student who broke his ball point pen in his hand. This student wrinkled his eyebrow and clenched his teeth. As he stared at his exam, it was clear that it was much too difficult. After that, he threw his broken pen aside and took out another one, continuing his exam.\u201cFrom the student\u2019s faces, I can tell that this year\u2019s mathematics exam is really difficult\u201d The examiner thought to himself.Indeed, essentially every single person in the room had wrinkled eyebrows and were in deep, bitter thought. Many students were so nervous that tears started falling.Students whose mathematics ability were already poor could only think\u2026.. Can\u2019t do this problem, can\u2019t do that problem, still can\u2019t do this third problem\u2026.. The students were on the verge of collapse as they looked at this kind of exam.\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203bOne hour later, testing classroom.The time duration for the mathematics exam is 2.5 hours.At this time, Luo Feng has already finished the \u2018multiple choice\u2019 and \u2018fill in the blank\u2019 questions. All that\u2019s left are the \u2018calculation\u2019 problems. In the mathematics exam, the multiple choice and fill in the blank problems only added up to 90 points. The calculation problems (five large problems) added up to 160 points. Only these types of problems were able to clearly demonstrate the student\u2019s mathematics ability.\u201cThis is really difficult, I couldn\u2019t even solve two of the fill in the blank problems\u201d Luo Feng took in a deep breath, \u201cBelow are the calculation problems. This is where the most points are. Solving just one more would give 30, 40 more points!\u201dOut of the five calculation problems, four of them are worth 30 points, while the last one is worth 40 points.\u201cHm?\u201d Luo Feng was already faced with a challenge as he looked at the first calculation problem.Luo Feng kept thinking and calculating on his scrap paper.\u201cYes, change this part by a bit, reverse that, and now wouldn\u2019t I be able to change that to the way I want?\u201d A light flashed in Luo Feng\u2019s eyes. Write! Write! Write! If you just think about it, this problem is actually quite easy to solve. Luo Feng easily finished the entire problem in one breath and then double checked his work.\u201cYep, first problem done\u201d Luo Feng looked at his watch on his left wrist and his heart jumped, \u201cThe first problem took me 20 minutes? I need to pick up the pace\u201dLuo Feng lowered his head and looked at the second problem.After looking at it for a bit, Luo Feng felt that it was easy and started calculating on his scrap paper.\u201cHm, not right\u201dLuo Feng felt like he wasn\u2019t thinking in the right direction and wrinkled his eyebrow. As time passed, Luo Feng kept working at this problem, \u201cYea, it should be this way. But how would I prove the next proof?\u201d Luo Feng\u2019s brain was working rapidly.\u201cHurry, hurry, hurry, I can\u2019t waste too much time on this problem. How on earth can I prove this?\u201d Luo Feng nervously thought.At this time\u2500\u2500On Luo feng\u2019s watch, the \u2018Pulse\u2019 number started rising.120\u2026\u2026125\u2026\u2026130\u2026\u2026140\u2026\u2026150\u2026\u2026\u201cI\u2019m almost there. Just this proof and I can earn 30 points. How do I even solve this part?\u201d Luo Feng was getting increasingly nervous. You must manage your time wisely in tests, but each mathematics calculation problem was worth a lot of points. Every high school student that wants to score well can\u2019t miss too many of these problems.At this time, Luo Feng was too focused on his test to notice his pulse meter.160\u2026\u2026170\u2026\u2026180\u2026\u2026Luo Feng felt his pulse increasing, but thought that it was due to anxiety and didn\u2019t pay it much attention.[THUMP THUMP THUMP] Luo Feng suddenly felt like someone was pounding on his heart. His vision started getting hazy and he finally realized, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me? Why does my heart hurt so much\u201d Luo Feng lowered his head and looked at his pulse meter displayed on his watch.\u2500\u2500230!This number changed the entire color of Luo Feng\u2019s face. Ever since he entered a coma at 12 and bought this watch, he has never seen his heart rate go over 180.\u201cI can\u2019t take this\u201d Luo Feng felt as if his heart was going to beat out of his chest. His blood was surging as his heart rate increased and an indescribable amount of energy flowed into the depths of Luo Feng\u2019s brain. Pain flowed from his brain\u2500\u2500\u201cAh, ah\u201d Luo Feng couldn\u2019t hold his voice in anymore.\u201cThis student, do you have a problem?\u201d The examiner ran towards Luo Feng and looked at him surprisingly.Luo Feng at this time looked like he was about to bleed. His forehead and arm\u2019s veins were bursting and even beating along with his heart. His entire body looked hideous.\u201cNo,No\u2500\u2500NO, slow down, slow down!\u201d Luo Feng had a bad feeling of what was to come and was screaming in his thoughts, staring at his watch.\u201c236\u2026\u2026242\u2026\u2026251\u2026\u2026!\u201d[THUMP THUMP THUMP]His heart, like a huge drum, let out waves of a low sound. His blood continuously surged.In his hazy vision, Luo Feng saw the number \u2018268\u2019 and the pain in his head caused him to collapse. As he was losing consciousness, he heard\u2500\u2500\u201cThis student, this student, wake up, wake up! Quick, call an ambulance!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Exam Results[DING DING DING\u2026..] The bell rapidly rang inside the Zhi-An region\u2019s first high school. The parents who were outside the school, on the grass, or sitting on the street all stood up. The parents looked inside the school through the gates.The bustling students all left the exam area.Year 2056, Jiang-Nan city\u2019s high school exams are officially over.All the students have to do now is to await their results, which will be released in one week.\u201cHao Bai\u201d A balding, middle-aged man who seemed refined was standing outside the gate, smiling towards his son.\u201cDad\u201d Zhang Hao Bai laughed as he went towards him.\u201cHow\u2019d you do?\u201d The middle-aged man laughed.Zhang Hao Bai shook his head and said helplessly, \u201cI couldn\u2019t demonstrate all of my skill, but the math problems were really hard. The multiple choice, fill in the blanks, and the calculation problems all had many difficult problems, especially the calculation ones\u2026.. There were five of them but I could only solve two. For the other three, I could only do my best at solving parts of them. According to the procedure, I should still be able to receive some points for that\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s dad, Zhang Ze Long, frowned, \u201cSo it seems like your math grade is going to be a bit low\u201d\u201cNo problem dad. It was hard for everyone, not just me\u201d Zhang Hao Bai laughed, \u201cThe math problems were all a bit harder, so I\u2019m sure that the points required for passing will be lowered. I should be able to get into a military academy without a problem\u201d\u201cOh, yea\u201dZhang Ze Long laughed, \u201cBefore, when we were waiting for your exam to finish, something happened. Your school\u2019s famous \u2018Luo Feng\u2019 student fainted inside the exam hall an hour before the end.\u201d\u201cFainted in the exam hall?\u201d Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s widened his eyes, \u201cDad, you mean Luo Feng?\u201d\u201cYea, that Luo Feng guy was carried away by an ambulance, many people saw the event occur.\u201d Zhang Ze Long nodded his head, \u201cIf you listen, many of the surrounding parents are telling their children of this event\u201d\u201cLuo Feng fainted?\u201dZhang Hao Bai looked around and listened closely. There were indeed many families talking about a student who fainted during testing. He also clearly heard many people mention the name \u2018Luo Feng\u2019.\u201cHaha, even this penniless bum has these kinds of days. Haha\u201d Zhang Hao Bai couldn\u2019t hold his laughter back.\u201cDad, although you don\u2019t know this, this person always causes trouble for me in school\u201d Zhang Hao Bai furiously added, \u201cHe is more stronger than me and more skilled than me in everything. Even this guy has these kinds of days\u201d Zhang Hao Bai was delighted, for his anger towards Luo Feng was immense.In truth, Luo Feng never even bothers with this Zhang Hao Bai, it\u2019s just that Zhang Hao Bai keeps treating Luo Feng as an opponent. Since Luo Feng\u2019s grades and martial arts skills are all greater than his naturally made him suffer.\u201cHaha, this guy has never seen the real world and was under too much psychological pressure. He couldn\u2019t handle it and collapsed. Ignore him. Go, your uncle knows your exams ended today and organized a banquet just for you. Let\u2019s go\u201d Zhang Ze Long laughed.\u201cUncle?\u201d Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s eyes flashed.The only reason the Zhang Family is able to prosper in the Zhi-an region is thanks to his uncle, because\u2026..His uncle, is a fighter!\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u201cNo way, there is absolutely no way!\u201dWei Wen, who just left the exam hall, panicked in front of his parents, \u201cHow could Feng collapse in the exam hall? He collapsed from nervousness? Impossible. Luo Feng\u2019s psychological qualities has even been praised by the Dojo of Limits instructors before\u201dWei Wen and Luo Feng were true brothers, even if not by blood.\u201cWen, there is no mistaking it. We saw this event unfold before our very eyes. That Luo Feng\u2019s father and his handicapped brother panicked in the moment and went to the hospital\u201d Wei Wen\u2019s father followed.\u201cHospital? It should be the nearest one. Dad, mom, I\u2019m going to go check on Luo Feng. I\u2019ll eat lunch later\u201dWithout delay, Wei Wen handed his test materials to his parents and ran towards the hospital.\u2026\u2026Inside Zhi-An region\u2019s people\u2019s hospital.Luo Feng was forcing a smile as he walked outside the hospital\u2019s main gate with his father and brother. At this time, Luo Hong Guo and Luo Hua were worried that Luo Feng wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the shock.\u201cDad, I\u2019m fine. Lets go home and eat\u201d Luo Feng seemed calm, but only regrets filled his heart. However, Luo Feng knew that the past cannot be changed, so all you can do is accept it!\u201cFeng, Feng\u201d a sound came from far away.Luo Feng turned towards the source and saw a small shadow far away running towards the hospital\u2019s main gate. It was his good brother \u2018Wei Wen\u2019.Luo Feng was moved by the sight of Wei Wen: he ran so hastily that his shirt was drenched with sweat. \u201cWen, how hard were the last three calculation problems on the mathematics portion?\u201d Luo Feng wasn\u2019t able to complete the last three problems, so if they were extremely difficult and many people couldn\u2019t do them\u2026Then his grades would still have some hope.\u201cPretty hard\u201d Wei Wen nodded, \u201cThis year\u2019s math problems were all very hard. Out of the five calculation problems, the third one was a bit easier, but the other four were all hard\u201d\u201cPhew\u201d Luo Feng let out a breath.He still had a sliver of hope\u2026..\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203b\u203bAt 8 PM on June 16th, you can check your exam grade through the phone or internet, and the dividing line* will also come out too.June 16th, around 7 PM.Luo Feng\u2019s home. Only Luo Feng was in the room that belonged to both Luo Feng and Luo Hua. He was sitting in front of his laptop and refreshing the webpage again and again. The exam results come out at 8 PM, but usually they release it a bit earlier.\u201cI\u2019m afraid, I can\u2019t get into Jiang-Nan\u2019s number one military academy\u201d\u201cHowever, I finished the multiple choice, fill in the blank, and the first two problems on the calculation section on the mathematics portion. Even though I didn\u2019t complete the second problem, I wrote quite a few steps, which should earn me some points\u201d Luo Feng thought to himself, \u201cIf I\u2019m lucky, I should be able to earn around 120 points on the mathematics portion\u201dLuo Feng anticipated, \u201cI performed normally on the liberal arts and science sections. If I\u2019m lucky, I should be able to become a bachelor\u201d\u201cIf I can just reach the dividing line, I can get into the number two military academy\u201dBetween the two academies, the first one is clearly better. However, a very high score is required, so Luo Feng already gave up on that.However, there is still a bit of hope left for the number two military academy.\u201cHm?\u201d Luo Feng\u2019s eyes flashed.The exam result webpage actually displayed something new after a refresh.\u201cGod, please help me a bit and let me pass the dividing line. As long as I pass it, I can get into the number two military academy\u201d Luo Feng was worried and anxious. He then typed his name, ID, and examination certificate and hit the 'search\u201d button.Search!The laptop page flashed a bit and soon displayed a form.Student: Luo FengSex: MaleID: 426123203806083211Examination Certificate: 5878643567890766Liberal Arts: 216Science: 223Mathematics: 118Total: 557Dividing Line: 561*TL note: In case you forgot, the dividing line is the score that separates the bachelors and specialists. For Luo Feng to get into the second highest ranked military academy, he needed to get at least the \u2018bachelor average\u2019 (dividing line).Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: Two Fighters\u201c557 points? The dividing line is 561 points?\u201d Luo Feng took a deep breath.Just four points! Just because of these four points, I lost my chance of going to a military academy.I can\u2019t believe twelve years of studying led to this.\u201cIf I can\u2019t go to a military academy, then so be it. There\u2019s no big deal\u201d Luo Feng focused his gaze and formed his right hand into the shape of a blade. He then made a horizontal cut into the space in front of him. Because of the hand\u2019s speed, the air violently trembled and shook. \u201cThanks to this time\u2019s coma, my strength has greatly increased!\u201d\u201cMaybe my current body fitness has reached the level required to be a fighter. I might be able to pass the Prospective Fighter exam\u201d\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a problem even if I\u2019m off by a bit. If I just seriously and bitterly train for one or two months, I should be able to pass the Prospective Fighter exam\u201dLuo Feng\u2019s adaptability ability is very high. His exam scores didn\u2019t make it to the dividing line, which shocked him. However, the \u2018coma\u2019 increased his strength, which made him confident again.After all, a military academy graduate\u2019s position is far from a fighter\u2019s.[KA] Luo Feng opened the door and entered the living room.In the living room, Luo Hong Guo, Gong Xin Lan, and Luo Hua all turned their heads. All three of them were concerned. Gong Xin Lan even stood up and walked towards Luo Feng: \u201cFeng, we can\u2019t blame you for your score. We can only blame your disease. Sigh, how could this disease start acting up now, it hasn\u2019t acted up for so many years\u201d\u201cBrother, you aren\u2019t in shock are you?\u201d Luo Hua sat on his wheel chair, making fun on purpose.When Luo Feng was inside his room checking his grades, the rest of the family used Luo Hua\u2019s laptop to check Luo Feng\u2019s results and learned of the four point difference. Although they were a bit disappointed, they were more worried about Luo Feng himself.Luo Feng laughed: \u201cOf course I\u2019m not in shock. Dad, mom, don\u2019t blame this disease. In fact, we should even be thankful?\u201d\u201cThankful?\u201d\u201cThankful?\u201d\u201cThankful?\u201dLuo Hong Guo, Gong Xin Lan, and Luo Hua were all shocked. High school exams are one of the most important events of one\u2019s life. Now that Luo Feng\u2019s exams were ruined by the disease, how could anyone be grateful towards it?\u201cDad, Mom, Hua\u201d Luo Feng smiled a little, \u201cWhen I was small, I had two comas and fainted. In fact, after I woke up from those comas, I felt like my strength increased by a large amount and am able to run faster. This time\u2026\u2026 is also the same! I feel like my fitness level is way greater than it was previously, and I estimate that I can pass the Prospective Fighter exam\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Luo Hong Guo, Gong Xin Lan, and Luo Hua exchanged glances.\u201cBrother, are you serious?\u201d Luo Hua couldn\u2019t hold back.\u201cOf course I am\u201d Luo Feng smiled a bit, \u201cAfter I pass the Prospective Fighter exam, I\u2019ll be able to apply for the Fighter Combat exam. I am quite confident in my combat abilities. I might even be able to achieve the rank of fighter this year!\u201dLuo Hong Guo, Gong Xin Lan, and Luo Hua were overawed by this piece of news.A fighter!What does that represent? It represents the most powerful group of humanity, it represents special privileges and rights! It represents a ton of money! It represents those at the top of the social hierarchy! And after you become a fighter, it\u2019ll bring along many benefits to your family; it is much better than becoming an elite student at a military academy.\u201cA fighter is going to come from our family?\u201d Luo Hua couldn\u2019t help yelling, \u201cHaha, Brother, you\u2019re awesome!\u201d\u201cFeng, great!\u201d Luo Hong Guo also excitedly patted Luo Feng\u2019s shoulder, \u201cBecoming a fighter is great. Compared to a fighter, what\u2019s so good about a military academy graduate?\u201dAs of now, all the fighters on earth are praise and exalted in society.Seeing how his parents and brother were so happy, Luo Feng laughed, \u201cDad, Mom, we can\u2019t be too happy before I actually pass the exam\u201d\u201cAn 18 year old fighter?\u201d Luo Hua couldn\u2019t help but excitedly shout, \u201cIf my brother really becomes an 18 year old fighter, then, then that would be too, too\u2026\u2026. AWESOME!!!\u201d\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7The day after that, 5 AM, the sky was bright.Luo Feng has just left home and was headed towards the Dojo of Limits.\u201cThere\u2019s barely anyone here at this time\u201d Luo Feng entered the dojo and found that the entire dojo\u2019s lawn and road had about just 100 people. There are about 30 to 40 thousand members total. \u201cThe dojo instructor only teaches at night, so night time is when there are the most people\u201dLuo Feng headed towards the elite member\u2019s building on the road.[RUMBLE~~~] A low sound wave carried over.\u201cHm?\u201dLuo Feng unknowingly turned his head and saw an elegant, white race car. As it slowly entered the dojo, Luo Feng looked carefully and couldn\u2019t help but to take in a breath: \u201cAston Martin\u2019s race car? And it\u2019s even the newest and most expensive one with the ability to fly: thr-191?\u201dHis brother really loved race cars. At home, he heard Luo Hua praise this thr-191.\u201cIt\u2019s an Aston Martin\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s even a 191, this one can fly\u201d Within the dojo, the few students scattered around were all lured towards this area, \u201cThis one car costs 36 million\u201dRight at this time, the race car stopped in front of the elite member\u2019s building\u2019s gate. The door opened and a short, red haired (clearly dyed) man wearing a loose dojo practice uniform walked out. His eyes randomly scanned the surroundings. He looked right past the regular dojo students but paused slightly on Luo Feng. However, without saying anything, he entered the building.\u201cIt\u2019s a fighter\u201d Luo Feng\u2019s eyes flashed.Luo Feng could feel the pressure from the fighter\u2019s gaze. This is a gaze that has a will of steel and has experienced many fights to the death.The spacious dojo training hall was empty; not a single person was there.It was only around 5 AM. Even at night, there usually wouldn\u2019t be more than 20 people.\u201cI want to see how much my strength has increased\u201d Luo Feng walked over and plugged in the fist strength tester machine. After turning it on, he turned on the speed tester machine that was far away.Standing in front of the fist strength tester machine.\u201cBegin!\u201dLuo Feng took in a deep breath. He used his waist as the center which released his power. It shot through his body like a huge python and created an explosive force through his arm. His fist was like a lightning bolt and suddenly a [PENG] sound was created on the machine.[DI, DI, DI] The fist strength tester machine let out three sounds consecutively.Luo Feng\u2019s eyes flashed. Usually, the machine doesn\u2019t make this kind of sound. The only time it makes this sound is under one situation\u2014\u2014the fist strength has surpassed 1000kg\u3002\u201cHm?\u201d Luo feng stared at the machine\u2019s display\u2014\u2014\u20191089kg\u2019\u3002\u201cSo high?\u201dLuo Feng was ecstatic. The fist strength required for a fighter was 900 kg. His previous fist strength was 809 kg. And now it shot up to 1089 kg, gaining 280 kg all of a sudden. Far more than enough to pass.\u201cHaha\u201dLuo Feng excitedly punched like lightning, shaking his entire body left and right. The[PENG PENG] sounds kept going. As if blinking an eye, Luo Feng already punched around 20 something times. And the machine\u2019s display showed a bunch of numbers scrolling across.\u2014\u2014\u2019956kg\uff0c989kg\uff0c923kg\uff0c965kg\u2026\u2026\u2019\u3002\u201cNow I\u2019ll test my speed\u201d Luo Feng headed towards the track, \u201cAs long as my speed passes, along with my naturally gifted reaction speed which was already qualified for a fighter, then I can definitely pass the prospective fighter exam!\u201dLuo Feng adjusted his breathing.[WHOOSH]His body was like a cannonball, flying through the track.\u2026\u2026Fourth floor of the elite member\u2019s building. A red haired man was talking and walking side by side with a bald, middle-aged man wearing a black shirt.\u201cYan Luo, how long has it been since our last meeting\u201d The middle-aged man smiled slightly, \u201cProbably almost three years. That immature kiddo from back then became this famous. I heard this time you earned nearly a hundred million. Hoho. When I look at you, I feel like I\u2019m old\u201d\u201cThat was all luck\u201d The red haired man laughed, \u201cBrother Jiang, back then\u2026..\u201d[DI, DI, DI]A weak sound came from a lower floor, which shocked and surprised the two men.\u201cThe fist strength tester machine downstairs is for beginners. Once 1000 kg is reached, it makes this sound\u201d The bald middle-aged man said surprisingly, \u201cThere\u2019s even someone practicing here at 5 AM. Since it\u2019s over 1000 kg, could it be that Yang Wu?\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t we know if we went down to look?\u201d[HU! HU!]One black shirt and one white shirt. These two people were like phantoms that flew down the stair cases. In a blink of an eye, they went from the fourth floor to the third floor\u2019s training hall\u2019s entrance.The black shirt wearing, bald middle-aged man and the white shirt wearing, red haired man looked inside the training hall. At this time, Luo Feng was standing in front of the track and soon flew past.\u201c28.1 m/s\u201d The bald middle-aged man and the red haired man both saw the number displayed on the speed tester machine.\u201cThis Luo Feng, strength over 1000 kg and an incredible speed of 28.1 m/s\u201d The bald middle-aged man was shocked.\u201cBrother Jiang, this guy seems quite young. He seems to already have reached the fitness level required for a fighter\u201d The red haired man said, astonished. The bald middle-aged man nodded: \u201cYea, his name is Luo Feng. He is one of the more gifted students in our dojo. He just had his 18th birthday this year!\u201d\u201c18? So young?\u201d The red haired man\u2019s eyes flashed.At this time, Luo Feng was shocked at who he saw at the entrance. The red haired man is the fighter who came in his race car, while the bald middle-aged man is this Dojo of Limits\u2019 master, \u2018Jiang Nian\u2019, who has the most power and authority. According to the dojo\u2019s rules, every student calls him \u201cinstructor\u201d.\u201cInstructor!\u201d Luo Feng yelled in greeting.\u201cCome here\u201d Instructor Jiang Nian laughed, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re so fast. You\u2019ve already reached what is required for a fighter. Let me introduce you, this is your senior, Yan Luo. Yan Luo, there\u2019s no problem with telling him your name right?\u201d\u201cNope\u201d Yan Luo looked at Luo Feng and nodded, \u201cThis young man has already reached the fitness requirement for a fighter at such a young age. Maybe, in the future, we\u2019ll have some sort of interaction\u201dJiang Nian looked towards Luo Feng and laughed: \u201cLuo Feng, since you\u2019re 18, you must\u2019ve taken your high school exams right. Ignore the results of that, what\u2019s the point of going to school? Just focus on taking the \u2018Prospective Fighter\u2019 exam. Oh yea, on July 1st, go to Tang Yang Zhou city\u2019s Dojo of limits to take your prospective fighter exam. With your current strength, you\u2019ll pass easily\u201d\u201cHigh school exams?\u201d Yan Luo laughed, \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time in college. You have nice talent. No matter what you do, you must put your all into it. Right now, you must put all of your concentration in martial arts. Kiddo, when you become a fighter, join our dojo of limits. You\u2019ll have a future by doing so.\u201dThese two fighters all held extremely high positions. The rich and the politicians of society were nothing to them.They were looking forward to young Luo Feng joining their ranks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: The Rights of a Fighter (part 1)\u201cYan Luo is right!\u201d Jiang Nian looked at Luo Feng and said earnestly, \u201cLuo Feng, you improve at a very fast speed. In our Zhi-An region\u2019s Dojo of Limits, you are probably the quickest learner as of now. You entered my Dojo of Limits at the age of 16. Now you\u2019re 18 and you have already reached the boundary of a fighter. If you go to college and waste your energy there, waste four of your years there, then that would truly be a crime!\u201d\u201cYou must know that you improve the quickest from age 16 to age 30. The older you get, the harder it gets\u201d Jiang Nian said seriously.The four years of college are indeed the easiest period for a fighter to train himself.Wasting these four years to study, from a fighter\u2019s point of view, is indeed a big sin.\u201cUh\u2026..\u201d Luo Feng was a bit stunned.God, looks like my exam failure wasn\u2019t so bad after all.\u201cLuo Feng, when you officially become a fighter, how about you join my Dojo of Limits?\u201d Jiang Nian smiled, \u201cas long as you become a fighter for my dojo, I\u2019ll arrange a special private villa just for you. Of course, you can\u2019t sell it. You\u2019ll also have a salary of at least twenty thousand Chinese dollars per month\u201d\u201cA private villa just for me? A starting salary of twenty thousand Chinese dollars?\u201d Luo Feng took a breath.Twenty thousand wasn\u2019t much, but a private villa was way too extravagant.As of now, China has only six human headquarters in total. In other words, six major cities. Land is extremely valuable and precious, so a villa would have an extremely high tax imposed on it. One ping in a regular home would cost tens to hundreds of thousands. This led to many people living in cheap rental homes.Regular homes are already so expensive. A ping in a villa or mansion would costs a couple hundred thousand Chinese dollars.And private villas, as of now, are all restricted by countries. You can\u2019t just live in them with money alone. You must have money, power, and a special position to be able to live in one. Considering the gigantic tax, one ping in private villa would cost millions.\u201cA small private villa would be around 300 ping, which is easily 200 to 300 million\u201d Luo Feng held his breath, \u201cEven though I\u2019m not allowed to sell it, but for a family to live in that private villa would make being born on this world worth it\u201dTwo or three billion, so what?Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s father, a tycoon, probably would never be able to live in a private villa like this.\u201cLuo Feng, my dojo\u2019s privilege\u2019s aren\u2019t too different from the country\u2019s special forces\u201d Jiang Nian laughed, \u201cThe special forces\u2019 fighters have a decent salary and special homes. The only thing they have that we don\u2019t is a \u2018Killing License\u2019, which allows them to kill any regular person if the situation calls for it. Of course, they aren\u2019t allowed to just randomly kill people, for they still have report the situation to the higher ups\u201d\u201c\u2018Killing License\u2019?\u201d Luo Feng heard of it before, that the special forces\u2019 fighters have the right to kill someone.\u201cHowever, our dojo also has special rights. If any regular person messes with you, you can report it to the dojo. After the dojo\u2019s investigators confirm the situation, they\u2019ll go through the Jiang-Nan security department and immediately bring that person away\u201d Jiang Nian laughed, \u201cIf you join our dojo, you\u2019ll have money, position, everything! You can chase towards the limits of humanity all you want! The dojo of limits!\u201dJiang Nian pointed to Yan Luo beside him: \u201cThis is my disciple Yan Luo, who just recently killed a monster and earned nearly a hundred million earth dollars for it. If you convert it, then that\u2019ll be around three hundred million Chinese dollars. If you work hard, with your talent, I\u2019m sure reaching his level is not impossible\u201dLuo Feng was dumbfounded.My gosh\u2026..Just by killing one monster would net you so much money? Just what level of a monster did he kill?\u201cLuo Feng, keep working hard. You\u2019re truly talented, so don\u2019t disappoint\u201d Jiang Nian smiled and patted Luo Feng\u2019s shoulder.\u201cKiddo, no matter what, don\u2019t relax, for I believe that you have a chance to become a Warrior-level fighter. At that time, money, position, beauties. You\u2019ll have everything!\u201d Yan Luo laughed a bit, \u201cAt that time, I\u2019ll be glad to go hunt some monsters with you. Haha\u2026..\u201d After saying that, the two fighters Jiang Nian and Yan Luo laughed as they left.Luo Feng was standing in the training hall, his thoughts in a mess.No matter if it was instructor \u2018Jiang Nian\u2019 or the mysterious red haired youth \u2018Yan Luo\u2019, Luo Feng could feel some sort of recklessness in their laughs and talks. Some sort of wildness!\u201cRecklessness, wildness?\u201d a smile started to emerge on Luo Feng\u2019s face, \u201cYea, men should be reckless on this world and create their own path! The strongest fighter on earth said before, a soldier who doesn\u2019t want to become a general is not a good soldier. A fighter who doesn\u2019t want to become the best fighter, doesn\u2019t have the heart of a fighter\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of living your life with your hands and feet tied?\u201d\u201cYou should create a sky shaking, earth shattering way for yourself!\u201d18 years old is when the value of your life starts to stabilize. After meeting instructor \u2018Jiang Nian\u2019 and the mysterious fighter \u2018Yan Luo\u2019, Luo Feng\u2019s thoughts completely changed.\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d\u201cThe strongest fighter, \u2018Hong\u2019, the second strongest \u2018Thunder Lord\u2019, created the Dojo of Limits and the Thunder Dojo, respectively. Even the five great countries have to treat them as equals. If they can do it\u2026\u2026 then couldn\u2019t a third person do it too?\u201d Luo Feng smiled as he walked out the training hall.Boys have dreams, so go chase them!Youth is your capital!Youth represents the infinite possibilities that the future holds! Everything depends on your own hard work, FIGHT!\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7June 28th, noon, bright sky.Luo Feng and Wei Wen were walking towards the third high school. Today is graduation day where they receive their graduation diplomas and acceptance application forms.\u201cFeng, are you sure you can pass the \u2018Prospective Fighter\u2019 exam?\u201d Wei Wen couldn\u2019t help but to exclaim.\u201cYep, on July 1st, I\u2019ll go to Yang Zhou city\u2019s dojo of limits headquarters\u2014\u2014Limit Hall\uff0cto take my exam\u201d Luo Feng smiled\u3002In front of them was school.Luo Feng looked at the school yard ahead of him and saw a bunch of students. As he looked, he felt like his attitude has changed: \u201cHm? I used to think of myself as one of them. But now, I feel like we\u2019re in two different worlds. They will go to college, work hard in their job, and have a family\u201d\u201cBut my path is different from theirs\u201d Luo Feng and Wei Wen entered the school and split up to their respective classes.Walking in the school hallway.\u201cBrother\u201d\u201cLuo Feng brother\u201d A few other senior students warmly greeted Luo Feng.\u201cI heard that when Luo Feng was taking his high school exam, he fainted in the exam room\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too bad, fainting in the exam room\u201d A bunch of people looking at Luo Feng from afar were discussing in a quiet voice.Luo Feng\u2019s fitness level has already reached the level of a fighter. His excellent hearing allowed him to hear every word of the students\u2019 discussions.Senior (5) class is Luo Feng\u2019s class.\u201cLuo Feng\u2019s here\u201d\u201cBrother Luo\u201d There were quite a few students already there and they all warmly gave their greetings.Luo Feng laughed and nodded.Most of these old students have a decent relationship with Luo Feng, but some of them dislike Luo Feng. They act warm, but there are still some old students in a corner quietly discussing: \u201cLuo Feng\u2019s grades were so good, and he\u2019s an elite member. Who could\u2019ve thought that such a thing would happen; fainting in the exam hall. Such bad luck\u201d\u201cThis is life, who can you blame?\u201dIn the past, Luo Feng was the class\u2019s most favored person.Good grades and skilled in martial arts. Now that such a thing has happened to this genius, many of the ordinary students will have a moment of happiness! Even though they are in a decent relationship with Luo Feng, humans feel happy when they see someone who was so brilliant in the past fall down. Thinking\u2014\u2014Even you have these kinds of days\uff01\u201cHanding out diplomas, handing out diplomas. And acceptance application forms. Everyone come get them\u201d The three class officers held the diplomas and application forms and walked towards the podium.\u201cWang Yin\u201d\u201cLiu Xia Long\u201dThe officers yelled everyone\u2019s names one by one and handed out the diplomas and application forms.\u201cLuo Feng!\u201d Following this sound, the entire classroom became silent. Virtually everyone\u2019s gazes landed upon Luo Feng.Everyone knew that Luo Feng fainted in his exams.All you need to know to find Luo Feng\u2019s grades is his ID and examination certificate, which aren\u2019t a secret. Students have checked his grades long ago and knew that he missed the dividing line by four points.\u201cLuo Feng\u201d Class Officer Qu Lin handed the diploma and acceptance form to him.\u201cFeng, Feng, let\u2019s go\u201d Wei Wen was standing in front of the class entrance.\u201cWait for me\u201d Luo Feng easily rolled up the acceptance form and threw it into the trash.The originally loud class immediately quieted down!Every student in the class froze. This is the acceptance form you fill in after exams! Who would dare throw that away?At this time, a \u2018Ma Que Ban\u2019 girl yelled out of shock: \u201cLuo Feng, how could you throw that away? You aren\u2019t going to fill in your acceptance form?\u201d\u201cHow could Luo Feng become a specialist. I guess he\u2019s going to redo a year and take the exam again next year\u201d Discussions and debates immediately fired up.Wei Wen, who was standing at the entrance, glared: \u201cBecome a specialist? Redo? You guys can figure this out, Feng is going to take the \u2018Prospective Fighter\u2019 exam, why take some bullshit specialist class or even redo?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say so much, let\u2019s go\u201dLuo Feng pulled Wei Wen and left with him.The students all said at once, What? Prospective Fighter exam?\u201cLuo Feng\u2019s going to take the Prospective Fighter exam? For real? He isn\u2019t that good is he\u201d\u201cI guess that Wei Wen was just bluffing. Luo Feng just became an elite member last year, how could he take the Prospective Fighter exam this year?Subconsciously, none of the students were willing to believe that Luo Feng has achieved the fitness level of a fighter.A fighter\u2026\u2026.That is a supernatural existence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: The Prospective Fighter exam (part 1)\u201cDad, Mom, I\u2019m going to the city\u2019s \u2018Dojo of Limits\u2019, so I might not come back to eat lunch today\u201d Luo Feng stood up after drinking a large bowl of gruel and eating three pieces of bread, \u201cJust wait today for my good news today. After I pass the exam, I\u2019ll call right away\u201dGong Xin Lan laughed and then glanced at Luo Hong Guo: \u201cHong Guo, did you hear that? You better have your cell phone on you at all times, or Luo Feng might not even be able to contact you\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to bring my cell phone\u201d Luo Hong Guo laughed.\u201cOk, I\u2019m leaving now\u201dLuo Feng winked at Luo Hua, who laughed and gave a thumbs up in return.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7Early in the morning, Luo Feng left the small Southern shore region and road the #11 subway line to \u2018Zhong-An road station\u2019 and then transferred to Yang Zhou city\u2019s center region. After leaving the subway station, he walked for ten minutes before arriving at Yang Zhou\u2019s Dojo of Limits headquarters\u2014\u2014Limit Hall\u3002Luo Feng left home at around 6 AM. By the time he arrived, it was already almost 8 AM.\u201cThis is the legendary Ming-Yue sector?\u201d Luo Feng stood in front of the huge door in the quiet sector. This sector\u2019s name is \u2018Ming-Yue sector\u2019 and is where the Limit Hall is located.\u201cThis man, this is the Ming-Yue sector, don\u2019t come close\u201dJust at the small sector\u2019s entrance, there was a row of six soldiers wearing their uniforms and holding real guns and ammo. You can tell from one look at their uniforms\u2026.. that they aren\u2019t part of the police, but part of the army. One of the soldiers shouted: \u201cSir, please stand back. Once you enter the yellow lined area, we have the right to shoot and kill you on the spot!\u201d\u201cJust like the legends\u201d Luo Feng thought to himself in his heart.Ming-Yue sector in Yang Zhou is where the Dojo of Limits\u2019 headquarters is located!Not only is the Limit Hall here, but also many fighters\u2019 homes.\u201cAccording to the rumors, the people that live here are the fighters and their families! Even the police don\u2019t have the right to come in as they please\u201d Luo Feng marveled in his heart.\u201cEveryone\u201d Luo Feng stood at the small sector\u2019s entrance and spoke, \u201cI am the Dojo of Limits\u2019 elite member \u2018Luo Feng\u2019. I came here today to take the Prospective Fighter exam\u201d. The Limit Hall holds the Prospective Fighter exam on the first day of every month.\u201cOh?\u201dFrom the guardsman\u2019s lounge an old, bald man walked out with a computer in his hand, \u201cYoung man, you came quite early, it isn\u2019t even 8 AM yet. Taking the Prospective Fighter exam at such a young age, your future is limitless. Ok, let me check your ID and elite member ID\u201dLuo Feng handed them over.[BEEP!]A message came up on the computer\u2019s display after scanning the identifications.\u201c18 years old?\u201d This old, bald man looked at Luo Feng in shock and then laughed, \u201cBrave enough to take the Prospective Fighter exam at 18 years old. Not bad, I hope you pass it today\u201d\u201cThank you sir\u201d Luo Feng replied.\u201cLet him in\u201d The old, bald man waved his hand.The small sector\u2019s electronic door opened automatically. At this time, a soldier holding an assault rifle stepped forward and followed Luo Feng: \u201cSir, I will bring you to the Dojo of Limits. After you enter the sector, please do not run around! You only have the right to enter the Limit Hall and not the fighters\u2019 homes. If you break this rule, even if I don\u2019t make a move, the people patrolling the area will\u201d This soldier even sneered at Luo Feng while telling him this.\u201cOf course\u201d Luo Feng slightly smiled and nodded, but was surprised inside.There indeed was a cooperative relationship between the country and the Dojo of Limits. At least the core of the Dojo of Limits will be heavily protected and guarded.\u201cWow, every building is a private villa\u201d Luo Feng looked around. Except for the center of the sector, which was the large, tall Limit Hall tower, everywhere else was a private villa. Between the villas were fake mountains, pools, and lawns.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7Ming-Yue sector, inside the Limit Hall. Right when Luo Feng stepped inside the lobby of the Limit Hall, the soldier went back.\u201cSir, are you here to take the Prospective Fighter exam?\u201d Inside the hall, a beautiful young woman smiled, \u201cSir, please sit over there. When it\u2019s 10 AM, take the exam with the others.\u201dLuo Feng nodded and walked towards the side of the lobby. There was a small bar there with a waiter and a bartender.\u201cHm?\u201d Luo Feng scanned the spots and saw that there were already three people sitting at the bar.Two of them were having a discussion while the other one was sitting silently on a sofa.\u201cLook at all of those villas. That is the benefit you get from joining the Dojo of Limits as a fighter\u201d A young man wearing a white shirt and pants said, \u201cAs long as you become a fighter and join the Dojo of Limits, you\u2019ll get a free villa and you\u2019ll be able to live here\u2026.. Heh, look at this environment, it\u2019s so comfortable\u201d\u201cOf course the fighter sector is different from all the other sectors outside. Look, a new person is coming\u201d The three people saw Luo Feng. Luo Feng slightly nodded and sat on the sofa at the side.Nobody knew each other, so there wasn\u2019t any exchange of talk.As time passed, three more people came, which Luo Feng recognized none of. However, from their looks\u2026. the three of them were a bit older, probably all over 30 years old. One of them was even over 40 years old.\u201cHa, Luo Feng!\u201d a loud sound came up.Luo Feng, startled, turned his head and looked, and saw a lean man with a face full of hideous scars walking towards him: \u201cYou\u2019re coming to take the prospective fighter exam too?\u201d\u201cBrother Yang?\u201d Luo Feng stood up and greeted him.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit embarrassing. I came to try last month but sadly \u2014\u2014my speed was only 24.9 m/s. It was off by just that one bit!\u201d Yang Wu said helplessly. In fact, Yang Wu passed a long time ago in fist strength and reaction speed. It\u2019s just that speed is his weak point.However, starting from this year, Yang Wu\u2019s speed started improving. 24.9 meters and 25 meters isn\u2019t really a big difference. If everything goes well, he might get a grade of 25 m/s.\u201cI\u2019m sure you can pass this time Brother Yang\u201d Luo Feng laughed\u201cThis guy named Yang tried so many times already and never passed. I bet this time you\u2019ll fail too\u201d a loud sound came from the side.Luo Feng looked over and the one talking was a buff man with a full beard. Yang Wu immediately glared: \u201cThe guy named Tong, you dare talk about me. Didn\u2019t you take the test and fail twice already? With your reaction speed, I guess you\u2019ll need at least another two or three more years of training\u201d\u201cSilence\u201d a cold sound came from the center of the lobby.The eight people currently there all turned their heads and saw a middle-aged man wearing a dojo uniform, \u201cLet\u2019s go, everyone follow me upstairs and take the exam. Remember, behave yourself once you\u2019re upstairs. Our old friends from Yang Zhou city\u2019s headquarters came over today, so don\u2019t cause trouble\u201d\u201cYes\u201d No matter if it was the arrogant full beard, Yang Wu, or Luo Feng; everyone listened and followed.\u201can old friend from headquarters?\u201d Luo Feng couldn\u2019t help but start guessing in his heart.Know this: Yang Zhou city has 12 Dojo of Limits and the Limit Hall. Each sector\u2019s Dojo of Limits\u2019 masters are called \u2018Instructors\u2019. The master of the Limit Hall is called the \u2018Chief Instructor\u2019.After entering the elevator, the loose uniform wearing middle-aged man pressed \u20186\u2019.[DI!] The elevator arrived at the sixth floor.[HUA!]The elevator door opened and what came into sight was a gigantic training hall with around a dozen people inside. Luo Feng recognized one of them to be instructor \u2018Jiang Nian\u2019.\u201cThey\u2019re here, stop chatting\u201d A middle-aged man with loose, long hair spoke and all of them looked at Luo Feng\u2019s group. When facing their glares, Luo Feng\u2019s group tensed up. They knew\u2026.. that those who appear inside the Limit Hall, other than the service personnel, are fighters.In other words, all of these people are fighters! Since this is the headquarters of the Dojo of Limits in Yang Zhou city.\u201cGet ready for examination\u201d The middle-aged man with loose, long hair commanded.Luo Feng has seen this man before on the internet. He is the master of the Limit Hall, Yang Zhou city\u2019s chief instructor \u2018Wu Tong\u2019.\u201cCome one by one and give me your ID\u201d The fighter who led Luo Feng\u2019s group up here took their IDs and handed them over to chief instructor \u2018Wu Tong\u2019 and laughed, \u201cBoss, there\u2019s quite a few people today. There are eight of them!\u201d\u201cYup\u201d Wu Tong randomly picked out an ID and scanned it on the machine next to him.[BEEP!]A crystal-like display that was almost transparent shot out from the machine and displayed a large amount of personal information.\u201cFirst one, Tong Guan\u201d The chief instructor was indifferent, \u201cBegin your fist strength test. Even those of you who came out of the army come to my Limit Hall to test, interesting\u201dLuo Feng, who was listening on the side, couldn\u2019t help but smile. The Dojo of Limits was created by the strongest fighter on earth. The dojos are scattered all around the world and their examinations have high credibility. Your examination results will receive recognition in every area in every country on earth.Even the army or traditional martial artists will come to the Dojo of Limits to take the exam.\u201cTest your fist strength\u201d The chief instructor commanded.\u201cYes\u201dThe full bearded man immediately took a step forward. With his left hand in front of his face and eyes wide open, his right fist flew through an arc and hit against the large machine, which only shook a little bit. The machine\u2019s display immediately displayed the number\u2014\u2014\u2019986kg\u2019\u3002\u201cPass, next, Luo Feng\u201d The chief instructor randomly chose the second ID and scanned it on the machine. He read through the descriptive personal information and couldn\u2019t help but to be shocked, \u201cEh? 18 years old? Old Jiang, this is your Zhi-An section\u2019s right? Since when did such a talented young man appear?\u201d\u201cHaha\u201d Instructor \u2018Jiang Nian\u2019 on the side couldn\u2019t help but to laugh.\u201cWe still don\u2019t know if he is truly skilled\u201d In the group of fighters at the side, a fat veteran scoffed, \u201cHe might not know what he\u2019s dealing with and has no strength\u201dInstructor Jiang Nian glared: \u201cWhat, jealous? Your northern section doesn\u2019t have any sort of genius like this. Luo Feng, show them my Zhi-An section\u2019s members\u2019 strength\u201d\u201cYes, instructor\u201d Luo Feng stepped up and headed towards the fist strength tester machine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: Reaction Speed\u201cOld Jiang seems pretty confident\u201d Chief instructor \u2018Wu Tong\u2019 said while laughing, but his gaze landed upon Luo Feng. Everyone at the scene was watching Luo Feng and awaiting his test results.Luo Feng stood in front of the machine and released an explosive power from his waist. His body turned slightly and increased the power from his waist even more. In an instant, all the power transferred to his arm. Luo Feng\u2019s fist was like an arrow fired from a bow under the full moon, leaving behind a blur. With a \u201cPENG\u201d sound, his fist smacked against the machine.After he threw his punch, Luo Feng was delighted: \u201cIt felt so good throwing that punch, all the power went with it\u201d. He looked at the display and saw\u2014\u2014\u201c1101kg\u201d\u201cGood\u201d\u201cNot bad\u201d Many fighters at the scene immediately complimented him.Chief Instructor \u2018Wu Tong\u2019 rubbed his chin and nodded: \u201cNot bad young man. Make sure to never lose your center \u2018shi\u2019 when throwing your punch. If someone ignores everything and only wants higher results for fist strength, he will lose his center \u2018shi\u2019. The punch might be stronger. However, against monsters, losing your center \u2018shi\u2019 is suicide! Not bad, not bad\u201d\u201cHaha, this kid Luo Feng has great combat abilities\u201d Instructor \u2018Jiang Nian\u2019 said while laughing, \u201cHe easily beat three elite members who were around his level of strength and speed!\u201dLuo Feng was delighted after hearing the instructor and chief instructor\u2019s compliments.He had a coma twice when he was younger, which led to increased strength and speed. Ever since then, he made a plan to become the best fighter! A really good fighter needs great combat abilities. In his teenage days, even though he hadn\u2019t joined the Dojo of Limits then, he looked up some basics of martial arts and trained alone at home to pile up the experience.This is why his combat abilities are so great.\u201cA nice bean sprout. Yup, pass!\u201d Chief instructor Wu Tong randomly picked another ID and scanned it, \u201cNext, Bai Yang\u201d.Luo Feng walked back to the place where examinees were supposed to stay.\u201cNot bad, crazy\u201d Yang Wu laughed.Luo Feng grinned.\u2026\u2026All eight of them quickly finished the \u2018strength test\u2019 and only one failed and was disqualified. His fist strength was only 892 kg, which was close but not good enough. So for the next test, the speed test, there were only seven people left.[KA!] Chief instructor Wu Tong walked towards the speed tester and turned on the switch.\u201cOne by one, in reverse order. First, Yang Wu\u201d Chief instructor Wu Tong commanded. Yang Wu was the last one to test his strength so he will be the first to test his speed.Yang Wu took a deep breath.He took the Prospective Fighter exam nearly 10 times and failed on the speed test every time.\u201cBrother Yang, you can do it\u201d Luo Feng patted Yang Wu\u2019s shoulder.\u201cWatch me\u201d Yang Wu adjusted his breathing and ran on the track.Instructor Jiang Nian frowned watching this. Yang Wu was also from the Zhi-An section, but he had failed the \u2018speed test\u2019 so many times already.[DASH!]Yang Wu stepped on the surface of the floor and made a low sound. With the strength of his arms and his explosive start, he quickly accelerated to his maximum speed. His veins were popping on his scarred face and he sprinted while clenching his teeth. He even let out a low howl after finishing the test.\u201cI must pass this!\u201d Yang Wu stopped and howled in his heart.He turned his head and saw Luo Feng give him a thumbs up. After seeing it. Yang Wu felt like he went to heaven.\u201cHaha, Yang Wu, nice luck. You actually passed\u201d Instructor \u2018Jiang Nian\u2019 also let out a refreshed laugh.Yang Wu ran over and looked at the display\u2014\u2014\u201925.1m/s\u2019\u3002\u201cPhew, so close\u201d Even Yang Wu laughed. If his body condition was slightly worse, he might not have achieved 25 m/s. If so, then he would\u2019ve failed once again.\u201cYup, pass!\u201d Chief instructor Wu Tong also smiled, \u201cNext\u201dEveryone did the tests one by one. Since Luo Feng was the second person to take the strength test, he was the second last to take the speed test.It was Luo Feng\u2019s turn soon enough.\u201cLuo Feng\u201d Chief instructor Wu Tong hollered.\u201cDo your best, crazy. We better take the Fighter Combat exam together\u201d Yang Wu encouraged and Luo Feng smiled and nodded. He walked onto the track and adjusted his breathing pattern. He lightly jumped twice in place. Luo Feng was unlike Yang Wu, who was a brute-force type; he gave off a relaxing feeling.[WHOOSH!]Right when he exerted his strength, Luo Feng was like a panther whose speed had no match. He brought a strong current of wind with him as he passed through the speed testing region. You could tell with just your eyes that Luo Feng\u2019s speed was significantly higher than those before him.\u201cI felt like that was okay\u201d Luo Feng turned his head and saw Yang Wu giving him a thumbs up. Even chief instructor Wu Tong and instructor Jiang Nian couldn\u2019t help but to nod their heads in praise.Luo Feng walked over and looked at the display\u2014\u2014\u201c28.6m/s\u201d\u201cNice speed, it\u2019s actually much higher than the passing mark\u201d Chief Instructor Wu Tong laughed and nodded, \u201cLast, Tong Guan\u201d.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7After the strength test, one person was eliminated. After the speed test, two people were eliminated. Now there were only five people left. The third test was the \u2018Reaction Speed exam\u2019.\u201cFollow me\u201d Chief Instructor Wu Tong brought the group of fighters and the five people remaining from the previous exams. They arrived at the \u2018reaction speed testing room\u2019 connected to the training hall.The room was around a hundred ping.Of course, compared to the gigantic training halls that were a couple thousand ping large, these reaction speed rooms were clearly much smaller. There was only a large, seemingly valuable machine placed on the floor. In front of the machine was something that looked like a six barreled gatling gun. However, there were easily a couple dozen holes in the machine, so it had way more firing sites than a gatling gun.\u201cFirst, Tong Guan\u201d Chief instructor Wu Tong instructed.The full bearded man immediately stepped in front of the gun. He was on a circle that had a diameter of 3.6 meters.[CLATTER!] The switch was turned on\u3002A red light started to emit above the border of the circle. It was like that the fighter inside was surrounded by a red curtain.\u201cRemember, no matter what, do not leave the circle. Once you leave it, it counts as a failure. If your body comes in contact with the red light, you lose points\u201d After chief instructor Wu Tong finished saying that, he walked to the reaction speed tester and pressed a bunch of buttons and adjusted the power. There were many different power levels.The lowest one is meant for intermediate members.And the highest one\u2026. is meant for top fighters.\u201cBegin!\u201d The chief instructor pressed a red button.[BEEP~~~BEEP~~~]The machine\u2019s gigantic cannon started revolving and all of the dozen barrels started emitting a red light. There were quick ones and slow ones and even the trajectory wasn\u2019t stable. It was very chaotic and messy. It then started to rapidly shoot within the circle.The bearded man stared in front of him and was continuously dodging right and left and between the red colored bullets.[PU! PU!] Two consecutive hits\u3002However, these \u2018bullets\u2019 are like rubber and have no power and speed, so they didn\u2019t hurt.Time passed by slowly.The bearded man was trying his best to dodge and the timer was reaching a minute.[TOOT~~~] After chief instructor Wu Tong pressed the button, the barrels quickly came to a halt. The middle display screen showed a large amount of information.\u201cWithin 60 seconds, 57 hits, and three contacts with the red light. Disqualified!\u201d Chief instructor Wu Tong said as he threw the bearded man\u2019s ID back to him.\u201cJust barely missed the mark\u201d The bearded man clenched his teeth and walked out of the circle as he shook his head.\u201cNext, Luo Feng\u201d Chief instructor Wu Tong commanded.After bumping fists with Yang Wu, Luo Feng walked into the circle.As Luo Feng stood in the circle and faced the machine\u2019s cannon, he took a deep breath. Before he entered the dojo, he constantly practiced at home. Luo Feng shines the most in these kinds of dodging exams: \u201cBefore high school exams, I get hit around 50-55 times in 60 seconds. Now that my body fitness level has increased, with my increased reaction time, passing this exam is no problem at all\u201d\u201cRemember, do not leave the circle no matter what. If you leave the circle, you instantly fail. If you come in contact with the circle\u2019s red light, you lose points\u201d After chief instructor Wu Tong said that, he pressed the red button.[BEEP~~~BEEP~~~]The barrel of the reaction speed tester started revolving rapidly. The cannon\u2019s dozens of barrels all started to emit a red light and soon shot out the rubber bullets rapidly.\u201cHm?\u201d Luo Feng stared ahead and rapidly calculated the positions in his head. As if he was a dexterous cat, he continuously dodged left and right and dodged the bullets one by one. Of course, some of the bullets were too fast to dodge, so he could only get hit.When Luo Feng was dodging, many of the fighters started to talk.\u201cThis kid isn\u2019t bad, his reaction speed is superb\u201d\u201cIndeed, he is fast and has a good foundation and form. Look, his feet are like a cat\u2019s pads, he never loses his balance after each turn, which allows him to rapidly change direction. This form\u2026.. if he isn\u2019t a genius or hasn\u2019t worked bitterly for ten years, then there\u2019s no way he would be able to have this kind of a solid foundation\u201dAll of the fighters at the scene were amazed.A fighter\u2019s fitness level could be trained. But form and skill all rely on experience. A higher body fitness level doesn\u2019t correspond to better form.[TOOT~~~] After pressing the button, the machine\u2019s cannon started slowing down and a large amount of data was displayed.\u201cWithin 60 seconds, 28 hits, 0 contacts with the red light. Excellent!\u201d Chief Instructor Wu Tong let out a smile, \u201cNot bad, Luo Feng. I congratulate you. After the official documents arrive and your data gets recorded, you\u2019ll become a prospective fighter!\u201d After the exam, an official certificate will be issued and your records are sent to the citizenship information agency within seven days.Luo Feng tightly clenched his right fist: \u201cI finally succeeded!\u201dI finally became a prospective fighter!\u201cLuo Feng, August 1st marks the date of the Fighter Combat exam. Arrive at the Limit Hall at dawn. Under the guidance of an instructor, you will go with other prospective fighters to hunt monsters outside the human bases! After you pass that exam, you\u2019ll become a real fighter\u201d Instructor \u2018Jiang Nian\u2019 smiled as he said that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yang Wu said in a low voice: \"Congratulations crazy, you're now a prospective fighter. After you pass the fighter combat exam, you'll become a true fighter!\" Luo Feng also replied in a low voice: \"Brother Yang, I'm sure you'll pass the reaction speed test without a problem. When the time comes, let's take the fighter combat exam together\"\"Okay\" Yang Wu was excited.After that, Yang Wu and Luo Feng focused their attention on the current examinee.Soon after, two people took the test. One succeeded and one failed.\"Last, Yang Wu!\" Chief instructor Wu Tong yelled.Yang Wu took in a deep breath; he has been waiting far too long for this day. Since he was always stuck on the speed test, this is the first time he'll be able to demonstrate his reaction speed in the limit hall.\"Go for it\" Luo Feng encouraged.\"No worries\"Yang Wu took a large step into the red circle and chief instructor Wu Tong pressed the button. The barrel of the machine started revolving and started firing the rubber bullets from its dozen barrels, which covering the entire circle.Yang Wu was moving swiftly within the circle.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng watched Yang Wu's movements and was surprised, \"Brother Yang seems quite stiff. He isn't as flexible as me, but his technique's efficiency seems high. He dodges by a small margin; he doesn't make use of the 3.6 meter diameter of the circle. Everytime he dodges, he only takes a step forward/back/left/right.Yang Wu's area of movement was small, but his dodging rate was high.\"This technique is indeed useful in real combat. However, you have to be extremely precise. If there is even one error, then the beast's claws will rip apart the fighter's body!\" Luo Feng evaluated in his heart. At least to Luo Feng, this seemed like an effective yet dangerous technique.It was like dancing on the edge of a blade.[BEEP!~~~] A minute soon passed, and the machine's cannon stopped revolving.\"Within 60 seconds, 52 hits, and no contacts with the red light. You pass!\" Chief instructor Wu Tong said.Yang Wu, who was still within the red circle, clenched his fists tightly. His veins were clear on his biceps and his eyes started tearing up. For this day, he has waited too long. Finally, he has achieved his dream. There is only one step left until the legendary rank of fighter.\"Yang Wu\" Chief instructor Wu Tong frowned, \"Your technique of dodging belongs to the 'Ru Wei' class. When fighting to the death with monsters, you use small movements to let their attacks barely miss you. Since you don't move as much, you can make more movements within the same amount of time, raising the chances of success\"\"However, this technique is extremely difficult. Even if you estimate the beast's claw to miss you by two centimeters, if even one mistake is made..... the claw might slash through your body and split you open! When fighting with monsters, you will probably die when you make an error. So--\"\"I advise you: When fighting with monsters, try to dodge a bit farther. Give yourself more space\" Chief instructor Wu Tong stressed, \"With your current strength, it's better for you to master the basics first. By doing that, you'll get better results\"Yang Wu was surprised, but soon nodded: \"Yes, chief instructor\"\"Yang Wu, take the chief instructor's words to heart. Avoid greedy thoughts in your way of martial arts. The 'Ru Wei' class is very powerful, but if you don't have the strength to perform them, then there will be no use. If you try to forcefully perform them, then you will be a mere copycat for others to laugh at\" Instructor Jiang Nian told him seriously.Chief Instructor Wu Tong laughed: \"Okay, three examinees have passed this time's prospective fighter exam: Luo Feng, Bai Yang, and Yang Wu\"Luo Feng, Yang Wu and Bai Yang have been suppressing their joy and happiness.If it wasn't for the surrounding senior fighters, then they probably would have been screaming in joy by now.\"Everyone, your next task is to sign the combat exam contract. Come do it\" As he said that, chief instructor Wu Tong looked towards a silver haired man in a black robe and laughed, \"Sorry for making you wait so long, captain. I'm sorry, let us go\"Captain?Luo Feng and the other two were shocked. The chief instructor was the head of Yang Zhou city's limit hall and had immense authority. If he says 'captain', then who on earth would that silver haired man in the black robe be?The silver haired man scanned Luo Feng and his group. For a moment Luo Feng felt like the silver haired man's eyes were like the infinite space, and all of a sudden he was being sucked inside. He shuddered and regained his consciousness. \"Exactly what just happened?\" Luo Feng soon found out that Yang Wu and Bai Yang who were next to him had very sluggish expressions.\"How fearsome, just one gaze and it messed us up completely\" Luo Feng was shocked inside.This power was too fearsome.If two people were fighting, then the opponent's gaze can mess with your consciousness before the fight even begins. By the time you regain composure, you might've been stabbed through the heart by your opponent already.The silver haired man smiled and looked at Luo Feng surprisingly.\"Kid, nice talent. Work hard\" The silver haired man slightly smiled as he said that.\"Huh, nice willpower too. Heh\" Chief instructor Wu Tong nodded in satisfaction.Chief instructor Wu Tong and the silver haired man immediately left.\"What, what just happened?\"\"What happened to me?\"Yang Wu and Bai Yang just regained consciousness. As they recalled the events of what just happened, they broke out in cold sweats. No matter if it was Yang Wu, Bai Yang, or Luo Feng..... they have never seen someone as frightening as that white haired man.\"This white haired man has been watching us the entire time. However, until now, I haven't noticed his presence at all\" Luo Feng was amazed, \"With no sound at all, it was like he never existed. Amazing. No wait....\"When Luo Feng tried to think of what the silver haired man's face looked like, he was shocked to realize--He only remembered those eyes which mesmerized him and couldn't recall his face at all.\"The three of you, come here\"Instructor Jiang Nian and the fighters with him smiled as they looked at the three, \"Come to the training hall\"They left the reaction speed testing room and entered the large training hall.\"These are the contracts for the combat exam\" One of the fat veteran fighters took out three of the contracts from the corner of the hall, \"Once you join the fighter combat exam, the Dojo of Limits takes no responsibility for your deaths! Of course, the death rate in the fighter combat exam is very low\"Luo Feng, Yang Wu, and Bai Yang accepted the contract and flipped through its contents.\"The death rate is low, but the injury rate is not\" A bald brute said deeply, \"In the fighter combat exam, you are fighting with monsters to the death! Of course this is the most basic type of hunting. When you individually go to the danger zones to hunt monsters in the future, the dangers will be far more horrifying compared to the fighter exam. If you can't even pass this stage, then you have no right to become a fighter\"Luo Feng, Yang Wu, and Bai Yang looked at each other.The contract is simple, it's main point is that if a death occurs in the exam, the Dojo of Limits takes no responsibilities.The three of them had no hesitations and immediately signed their names on the documents.\"Okay\"Instructor Jiang Nian, who was beside them, smiled, \"Good. Today is July 1st, so there is one more month until the actual exam. In this month you should make the appropriate preparations. Oh yea\" Instructor Jiang Nian walked to the keyboard beside him and rapidly pressed some buttons. Soon enough, a large screen was displayed on the wall of the training hall, and an article appeared.It was called--\ufffd\ufffdGenetic Energy Technique\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"Hm?\" Luo Feng held his breath.The reason why the fighters have such powerful bodies, why some of the top fighters can surpass mach speed! Why their knives can slice through thick steel! Of course, with Luo Feng and his group's strength, they are no where close to the legendary fighters.Why are fighters strong?Because they rely on genetic energy!\"Back when humanity was infected by the RR virus in the Grand Nirvana period, our genes started evolving to fight against the virus\" Instructor Jiang Nian smiled, \"When the genes evolve to a certain point, it's able to absorb the faint energies of the cosmos. The energy envelops every cell of your body! During this process, your genes, bones, cells, blood, organs, and skin will all continue to evolve and become stronger!\"\"Your bones can become tens to hundreds of times harder than diamonds. Your organs will be powerful enough to hold your breath in water for half an hour, and longer!\"\"All of this relies on the energy you absorb and envelop your cells with. It becomes your power, in other words--genetic energy\ufffd\ufffd\"Instructor Jiang Nian pointed to the article on the screen: \"This, this is the technique to enhance your genes--The Wu Xin Xiang Tian* technique\ufffd\ufffdWhich is also the only technique to train your genetic energy.\"Luo Feng immediately started to carefully read the article.Genetic energy, human gene enhancement, reliance on evolution!\"So that's how it is\" Luo Feng understood after he read it carefully.Normal people aren't able to train this because their genes weren't suitable. Once your fist strength reaches 900 kg, your speed reaches 25 m/s, and your reaction speed all pass the mark required for a prospective fighter, then your genes were ready for training. 90% of prospective fighters are able to start training!\"You guys can start trying to train your genetic energy in this month\" Instructor Jiang Nian smiled, \"And the most valuable 'Dao Ying' technique will only be available to you after you become a fighter.There was only one way to train your genetic energy on earth.However, there were millions of Dao Yin techniques. Training in the Dao Yin techniques could be increase the speed of genetic energy training by ten times. That's why the Dao Yin techniques are valued by all powers.*Literally means five hearts towards the sky, which sounds a bit weird so I didn't change it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Joy\u201cInstructor\u201dBai Yang couldn\u2019t help but to ask,\u201cI have heard about how great the Dao Yin techniques are, but exactly how great are they? How can it increase the process of genetic energy training?\u201dAt this time, a middle-aged man with graying hair said: \u201cBai Yang, I\u2019ll tell it to you this way. For instance, if you don\u2019t learn the Dao Yin techniques and only use the \u2018Wu Xin Xian Tian\u2019 techniques forever, then your cells will be full from energy after 5 minutes of training a day. Your cells won\u2019t be able to absorb more energy!\u201d\u201cHowever, by using the Dao Yin techniques, the capacity of your cells will increase. This way, you can practice for 8 minutes, maybe 10 minutes, and maybe even an hour!\u201d This middle-aged man looked towards Luo Feng\u2019s group, \u201cDo you guys understand now?\u201dAfter hearing this, Luo Feng suddenly realized.\u201cThe Dao Yin techniques simply increase every cell\u2019s appetite\u201d Luo Feng thought to himself. The cells absorbing the faint energies of the cosmos and transforming them into genetic energy is just like how humans need to eat food! If a man could only eat three meals, the Dao Yin techniques could make him eat five or ten meals.Jiang Nian smiled: \u201d If you don\u2019t train in the Dao Yin techniques, then pretend that the amount of energy your cells can absorb is a unit! Once you start training in the Dao Yin techniques, the amount of energy your cells can absorb could become two units, three units, or maybe even more! In other words, your one year\u2019s of training could surpass another person\u2019s 10 years of training. This is the charm of the Dao Yin techniques\u201dEvery fighter at the scene talked about the Dao Yin techniques, as each of them clearly had a lot to say about the topic.\u201cAbout the Dao Yin techniques, the strongest fighter, leader of all the Dojo of Limits, \u2018Hong\u2019, created nine types of Dao Yin techniques. If you join my Dojo of Limits and contribute enough towards the dojo, then you might have a chance to learn these top class Dao Yin techniques\u201d The fighters all laughed and enticed Luo Feng and his group.All the great powers on earth hope to have more fighters in their country.\u201cInstructor\u201d Luo Feng suddenly spoke up.\u201cHm?\u201d Instructor Jiang Nian laughed as he looked towards Luo Feng, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d\u201cInstructor, about the silver haired man who just walked out with the chief instructor. How come he could stop all forms of resistance with just one gaze? What kind of power does this fighter have?\u201d Luo Feng had never heard that fighters were this powerful, so he was very curious.Instructor Jiang Nian slightly laughed, while the fighters beside him completely laughed out loud.\u201cKid, that person who walked out with the chief instructor is a spirit reader! Spirit readers are even fewer in number than us fighters\u201d The fighters all laughed as they said, \u201cOf course, the spirit readers are usually fighters too! However, they are the most frightening existence within the fighters\u201d\u201cSpirit reader?\u201d Luo Feng was shocked.Luo Feng had read introductions about them thanks to the modern internet. They all said that the spirit readers are a special existence within the fighters, and also a very terrifying existence.However, the internet didn\u2019t explain specifically on exactly how terrifying they actually were.\u201cAfter you become a fighter in the future, you\u2019ll come to know spirit readers\u201d Instructor Jiang Nian laughed, \u201cAlright, today\u2019s prospective fighter exam is over. The three of you can return home too. Yup, make sure you stamp your contracts and hand in your documents. We\u2019ll contact you in a few days. Alright, you guys can go now\u201d\u201cYes, instructor\u201dLuo Feng, Yang Wu, and Bai Yang turned and left the training hall. They were escorted and carefully watched by the gun-holding guardsmen as they left the sector.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7Ming-Yue sector\u2019s entrance. Luo Feng, Yang Wu, and Bai Yang were all smiling brightly.\u201cMy name is Bai Yang, and I\u2019m from the top military academy in Jiang-Nan. My family lives in Yang-Zhou city, so I took this chance to take the exam while it\u2019s summer vacation\u201d Bai Yang stuck out his hands to both Luo Feng and Yang Wu for handshakes, \u201cI\u2019m glad to be able to meet you two\u201dJiang-Nan\u2019s top military academy?Luo Feng was planning to go there.Luo Feng laughed: \u201cMy name is Luo Feng, and he is Yang Wu. We are both from Zhi-An region\u2019s Dojo of Limits\u201d\u201cLuo Feng brother\u2019s future is surely limitless. Not many people become fighters even in our elite class in the military academy\u201d Bai Yang happily made friends. For Luo Feng to become a prospective fighter at such a young age, he was even more happy to become friends. Luo Feng might become a super important person in the future.Yang Wu laughed on the side: \u201cLet\u2019s not say so much. It must be fate for all of us to pass the exam at the same place on the same day. Today\u2019s a good day. Let\u2019s find some restaurant to eat heartily and chat happily\u201d\u201cOkay\u201d Bai Yang smiled and accepted.\u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d Luo Feng also laughed.The three of them just passed the prospective fighter exam and were bursting with excitement. They selected a restaurant and ate lunch together, and then went their separate ways back home.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7Luo Feng drank some liquor today and was waiting to report the good news to his family on the subway.However, there were too many people on the subway. He was afraid that if he spoke the words \u2018passed the prospective fighter exam\u2019, he would cause a scene: \u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t be too late to call after I exit the subway\u201d\u2026\u2026After taking the #1 subway line to Zhong-An road station, it would take a long walk to get to Zhong-An road station\u2019s #11 line.\u201cI\u2019ll tell dad, mom, and brother now\u201d Luo Feng has been excited up until now.Prospective fighter\u2026..His family has been so poor and working for so many years, he has been working for so many years, and finally there\u2019s some accomplishment!As he stood on the sidewalk of Zhong-An road station, Luo Feng took out his cell phone.[BEEP\u2026.. BEEP\u2026..]After typing in the number, Luo Feng waited.\u201cHello.\u201d The cell phone carried his brother\u2019s voice, Luo Feng laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s me\u201d\u201cOf course, don\u2019t you even know what kind of person your brother is? Of course I passed. Haha, yea, yea, okay\u201d Luo Feng held his cell phone and happily said, \u201cHm, is mom home? Okay, let mom take the phone\u201d\u201cHello, mom, it\u2019s me, Feng\u201d Luo Feng was bursting with happiness.As he heard his mother\u2019s happily excited voice across the cell phone, the sides of Luo Feng\u2019s eyes started to become moist, for he has worked for this day for far too long: \u201cMom, you asked three times already. I really did pass the exam. The forms will arrive at home in a few days\u201d\u201cI ate already, with the other two people who passed\u201d Luo Feng laughed, \u201cOh, call dad? Don\u2019t worry mom, I won\u2019t forget. Okay, I know\u201dAfter he hung up, Luo Feng couldn\u2019t help but to let out a smile.Happiness, satisfaction!Wasn\u2019t Luo Feng\u2019s bitter training since childhood all for the sake of this day?Luo Feng adjusted his breathing and calmed himself, or else he wouldn\u2019t be able to call his father\u2019s cell phone. In this family, Luo Hong Guo is the family\u2019s mountain, the family\u2019s pillar! Before Luo Feng became an elite member, the family had to completely rely on what his father earned.Even though his mother works, she needs her energy to take care of her two sons, even more so since one of them is handicapped.Father\u2019s home remodeling work is bitter and hard. He frequently gets injured on the job.\u201cDad, from now on, you will never have to go through such exhausting work again\u201d Luo Feng thought to himself.[BEEP\u2026.. BEEP\u2026..]A sound came from the cell phone as Luo Feng waited for his father to answer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: You asked for it\u201cHm, how come there\u2019s no answer? It\u2019s around 12 right now, so it should be lunch time. My dad and the others are remodeling right now and they usually take a break during the noon, so he should be able to answer the phone\u201d Luo Feng looked doubtfully at his cell phone\u2019s screen and pressed the \u2018Cell Phone Location Searcher Function\u2019. The screen of the phone quickly displayed a map of Yang Zhou city. The small red dot on the map represented Luo Feng\u2019s cell phone\u2019s location, while the small green dot represented his father\u2019s.\u201cNot too far from where I am now\u201dLuo Feng knew in an instant where his father\u2019s current location is and couldn\u2019t help but to let out a smile, \u201cI\u2019ll run to my dad\u2019s side and tell him in person about the good news\u201dLuo Feng quickly went to the location displayed on the cell phone\u2019s map.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7Zhi-An region, Sky Garden sector.\u201cHurry, hurry and move those things so you can go take a break and eat lunch. We should go eat some food too\u201d In one of the private villa\u2019s lawns in the sector, Zhang Hao Bai, pale and wearing long, white pants, urged the workers on. He even had three cold faced bodyguards by his side.\u201cMister, don\u2019t rush, this furniture is extremely valuable. Don\u2019t underestimate it, get some more people and work a bit harder!\u201d A truck was parked by the private lawn and had a lot of sealed wooden furniture.Wooden furniture in these days are extremely valuable and expensive. They are a luxury item which belong to few.Because, all the humans live in cities. There are very few places to plant trees, and most of trees are for decoration. Although there are many trees outside the city, many monsters are there too. The price for lumber is extremely high, since you will have to fight monsters to get it.Most people\u2019s furnitures these days are made out of plastic, while some of the better ones are made out of glass.A normal family wouldn\u2019t be able to afford wood products.\u201cBe careful\u201dThe remodeling company\u2019s workers carefully moved the heavy furniture from the truck to the ground. After that, three of the workers would carefully move the furniture into the lawn.\u201cBe careful\u201d Zhang Hao Bai frowned and reminded, \u201cThis is furniture made out of real, high quality wood. If you break it, you\u2019ll surely get in trouble with your boss\u201d[HU, HU]The three workers carefully moved the furniture. The furniture was extremely valuable and heavy, around a thousand kg. It\u2019s a bit of work for these three workers to move it.\u201cStop and rest for a bit. Move it into the house in one breath later\u201d The worker lifting in front ordered, \u201cPut it down here for now. Slowly, lightly\u201d The three workers slowly put the furniture on the lawn. Only after doing so were they able to straighten their backs and take a good breath of air.\u201cOld Luo, I\u2019m already hungry after doing that\u201d A tall worker started stretching his body.\u201cAfter moving this and two more pieces of furniture, we\u2019ll be done. After that, we can all eat together\u201d Luo Hong Guo laughed as he looked at the two other workers. He wiped his sweat off with his shirt. It was June and almost 1 PM, so it was the hottest time of the day.For the three of them to move a valuable piece of furniture that weighs 1000 kg, it surely was bitter work.\u201cWork faster!\u201d Zhang Hao Bai ordered impatiently.\u201cAight\u201d Luo Hong Guo bended down to grab onto the furniture, \u201cGuys, work hard and move this piece of furniture in\u201d\u201cCome, one, two, three, up!\u201dLuo Hong Guo and his group lifted together and carefully went up the steps. They quickly entered the house and came out soon after. When Luo Hong Guo and his group walked past Zhang Hao Bai, Zhang Hao Bai frowned after smelling the sweat emanating from them.\u201cPoor people will be poor people, doing this kind of bitter work. They\u2019ll have a bitter life for the rest of their lives\u201d Zhang Hao Bai thought to himself.Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s dad was rich, so he was born into a wealthy family. Zhang Hao Bai has always looked down on those of at the bottom of society. To him, those willing to do these kinds of bitter work have no fighting spirit and deserve to live through their bitter days.\u201cCareful, don\u2019t touch the gate\u201dLuo Hong Guo and his group carefully moved the furniture step by step. Their shirts were drenched in sweat. A droplet of sweat leaked down from a head and rolled down into their necks.\u201cRest for a bit outside of the home\u201d Luo Hong Guo put the furniture down and adjusted their breathing.\u201cGo, one, two, three, up!\u201dEven though Luo Hong Guo and his group were tired, they\u2019ve been doing this for 20 to 30 years, so they\u2019re used to it. They know their limits, so mistakes rarely occur.Soon after, Luo Hong Guo and his group went to move the final piece of furniture.\u201cIt sure is hot\u201d Zhang Hao Bai raised his head and looked towards the sky, \u201cBrother Wang, we\u2019ll go eat at a nearby restaurant later\u201d\u201cThanks young master\u201d The three bodyguards laughed in reply.Zhang Hao Bai glanced at the final piece of furniture the three workers were carrying and let out a snort from his nose. He naturally hated these kinds of peasants. Suddenly, his gaze landed upon the marble used for pavement. One of the tiles had a crack, which was accidently made when he sparred with his bodyguards a few days ago.\u201cHm?\u201d Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cI was low on money recently and now\u2019s a good chance to make some!\u201dAt this time, Luo Hong Guo and his group were busy moving the third piece of furniture.Suddenly\u2014\u2014A cell phone started ringing, Luo Hong Guo, who was currently moving the furniture, rejoiced in his heart: \u201cIt must be from Feng\u201d However, since Luo Hong Guo is moving furniture, he can\u2019t answer the phone. He\u2019ll have to call back after he puts the piece of furniture down.\u201cRest for a bit outside the house, lightly, slowly\u201d Luo Hong Guo and his group slowly put the furniture down.Luo Hong Guo took the cell phone out of his pocket. Looking at the display, the call was indeed from his son. He let out a smile and preparing to call back.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with you guys?\u201d\u201cHey, we told you guys to be careful, what are you guys doing?\u201d A voice of anger rose.Luo Hong Guo and his group turned their heads in surprise and only saw Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s gloomy face. Zhang Hao Bai was angrily pointing at the marble: \u201cIs this how you do things? Since you guys weren\u2019t even focusing, look, my home\u2019s pavement was broken by you guys. This is Nan-Shan marble, which was bought outside the city. One piece of marble would cost around a hundred thousand dollars, can you pay that? HUH!!!\u201dLuo Hong Guo and his group lowered their heads and looked\u2014\u2014Indeed, on the pavement towards the road, one of the marble had a small crack.\u201cHmph, I\u2019ll call your company\u2019s boss. What\u2019s with this\u201d Zhang Hao Bai fumed, \u201cBrother Wang, you have their company\u2019s phone number right? Call their company and get their boss over here! There\u2019s no point in talking with these people anymore\u201d\u201cI have their company\u2019s phone number here\u201d The bodyguard named Wang immediately took out his cell phone and started dialing.Luo Hong Guo and his group were well acquainted.\u201cThat\u2019s wrong\u201d The large worker immediately said, \u201cThe crack on the marble was already there. I saw it\u201d\u201cMaking excuses? There is no ****ing point in making excuses\u201d Zhang Hao Bai laughed loudly.Luo Hong Guo frowned. As an experienced, old worker, he knew these kinds of disputes were the most troublesome. The company usually highly values its reputation. If their reputation is harmed and the company has no evidence to prove that their workers didn\u2019t make the crack, then usually the company can only pay for the loss.If the company pays money, then the money will be taken out of the salary of the three workers responsible.\u201cLet\u2019s move the furniture in first and then talk\u201d Luo Hong Guo spoke as he went to lift the furniture.\u201cMove the furniture?\u201dZhang Hao Bai stepped forward and shoved Luo Hong Guo and started lecturing the three workers, \u201cDon\u2019t play tricks! The furniture on the marble is the proof! You want to move the furniture in and then play dumb? I\u2019ve seen these petty tricks all the time. Wait for your boss to come and then talk\u201d\u201cOld Luo, old Luo\u201dThe other two co workers went to help Luo Hong Guo up.\u201cNo problem\u201d Luo Hong Guo brushed off his shoulder.\u201cHow could you guys shove people\u201d\u201cWe aren\u2019t even sure if we broke the marble, what\u2019s the meaning of shoving?\u201d The other two co workers immediately glared and spoke in anger. These people who do these kinds of work fear nothing, if they are angered, then a fight would occur. Even if they get jailed by the police, they only want money and not their lives, so even the police cannot deal with them and will eventually release them.\u201cDon\u2019t try and argue with me!\u201d Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s two legs were like lightning and kicked the two workers\u2019 stomachs.[PU! PU!]The two co workers flew away and fell on the ground.\u201cHmph, you don\u2019t know who you\u2019re arguing with\u201d Zhang Hao Bai laughed coldly. His Zhang family in the Zhi-An region had a wide range of contacts. Even if he beat up some regular workers, nothing would happen.\u201cOld Tian, Big Monkey, are you okay?\u201d Luo Hong Guo was getting nervous too.\u201cYoung man, how could you do this?\u201d Luo Hong Guo said angrily.Zhang Hao Bai frowned after smelling Luo Hong Guo\u2019s sweat and waved: \u201cBrother Wang, you guys teach them a lesson so they\u2019ll be quiet\u201d\u201cYoung Master, the remodeling company\u201d The bodyguard named Wang handed over the cell phone.\u201cOkay\u201d Zhang Hao Bai waved his hand and the three bodyguards immediately went to beat up the three workers, while Zhang Hao Bai held the phone, \u201cYes, I am from the sky garden. Let your chairman Hou take the phone. Chairman Hou, what\u2019s the problem with the three workers you sent today? They are sloppy and cracked open my lawn\u2019s marble pavement. Hurry up and send people and sort this out. If you don\u2019t figure this out, don\u2019t expect any money!\u201dWhile the conversation was still going\u2014\u2014\u201cStop\uff01\u201dAn angry voice came from outside the lawn.At this time, Luo Hong Guo and his coworkers were in a corner and had foot prints all over them from the bodyguards.\u201cHm?\u201d The three bodyguards and Zhang Hao Bai all turned their heads.A shady image flew into the lawn and Zhang Hao Bai recognized him in an instant and raged: \u201cLuo Feng, you came to my house to receive a beating?\u201d\u201c**** you!\u201d Luo Feng saw his father: bent back, drenched in sweat, and covered in foot prints. Luo Feng\u2019s eyes immediately turned red. His father had to endure such a bitter life and is always frowned upon. And today, something like this happened to him.One of the bodyguards who was short and fat laughed coldly as he stepped up.\u201cGet the **** out of the way!!!\u201d Luo Feng shouted and his leg, like lightning, kicked harshly. The bodyguard even blocked it with his right arm.[PENG!]The heavy kick immediately widened the fat, short bodyguard\u2019s eyes. He flew out four to five meters in the air before falling back to the ground. The other two bodyguards were stunned.\u201cLuo Feng, you dare hit my men!\u201d Zhang Hao Bai glared and shouted, \u201cYou asked for it\u201d\u201c**** you!!!\u201d Luo Feng shouted in anger as he glared fiercely and clenched his teeth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: I\u2019ll cooperate\u201cAttack, attack together!\u201d Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s face was red with fury as he waved his hands in anger.This Luo Feng dare mess on his territory and attack his bodyguards.\u201cBe careful, his kicks are heavy\u201d The fat bodyguard on the ground rubbed his stomach. Some blood leaked out the side of his mouth and he couldn\u2019t get up for a while.\u201cKiddo, think you\u2019re tough eh\u201d The bodyguard named Wang and the other bodyguard rushed towards Luo Feng\u2019s direction. As they had witnessed Luo Feng\u2019s power, they were careful to not underestimate him. At this time, Luo Feng rushed to his father\u2019s side, but before he could say anything, Luo Hong Guo shouted: \u201cI\u2019m fine, Feng, behind you!\u201dWithin an instant the two bodyguards came from the left and right to attack Luo Feng simultaneously. Even that Zhang Hao Bai was coming in pursuit.The three of them together!\u201cHmph!\u201d Luo Feng glanced out the corner of his eye and instantly turned. WIth the power that came with the rotation, he shot out his right arm in the shape of a blade and cut across the space in front of him as if it was a combat blade.[HU!]The arm caused a powerful current to blow ahead of it.\u201cNot good\u201d The bodyguard named Wang\u2019s face instantly changed and he ran up to block Luo Feng\u2019s arm with both of his arms.[PENG!] The sound of an impact.Luo Feng\u2019s blade powerfully hit the bodyguard named Wang\u2019s two arms.The bodyguard named Wang felt that his arms weren\u2019t his own anymore. They hurt so much that there was no feeling for a moment. His right arm fell powerlessly and he retreated while yelling: \u201cMy right arm\u2019s fractured!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Zhang Hao Bai, who was getting ready to move, was shocked. His bodyguards were all elite members of the dojo. Luo Feng, also an elite member, should have around equal power. There was no way that his attack could fracture the arm of the bodyguard named Wang, who was also an elite member.\u201cNot good!\u201d The bodyguard named Wang was injured, so only the tall bodyguard in black was left. He was surprised and enraged as he witnessed his comrades\u2019 defeat.The bodyguard in black clenched his teeth and howled as he threw a kick and a punch with lightning speed.[WHOOSH! WHOOSH!]Luo Feng was dextrous, so it only took two sways to dodge the two attacks. He then prepared for a powerful chop.He raised his right hand high in the air and attacked. His chop was like a knife!\u201cIt\u2019s too fast\u201d The bodyguard in black couldn\u2019t dodge, so he could only put his arms above to block and clench his teeth as he received the attack! As Luo Feng\u2019s frightening attack came down, the bodyguard\u2019s heart was filled with fear.[DON!]The bodyguard lost feeling in both of his arms and they were softened by Luo Feng\u2019s attack. However, Luo Feng\u2019s chop didn\u2019t lose momentum; after hitting the bodyguard\u2019s arms, it fell on his shoulder. Over a thousand kg of power instantly made the bodyguard kneel on the ground.\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Zhang Hao Bai, who was getting ready for a sneak attack, stopped out of shock.The three bodyguards: One grasped his stomach as he tried to climb up, the other had a fractured arm, and the other was kneeling on the ground from just one chop.\u201cZhang Hao Bai!\u201d Luo Feng\u2019s eyes were like flames, as if he was about to eat someone.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing. Luo Feng, what are you doing!\u201d Zhang Hao Bai quickly backed two steps away and yelled, \u201cThis is my home! How dare you barge in here and hit my people and still act so arrogantly!\u201d\u201cYou dare hit my dad, kick my dad!\u201d Luo Feng clenched his fists. All the muscles on his body were like steel and his veins were like worms.\u201cYour dad, I don\u2019t even know who your dad is, how could I hit your dad and kick your\u2026..\u201d Zhang Hao Bai suddenly looked towards the three workers who were still dirty and covered in footprints. He realized in an instant why Luo Feng just barged in without saying anything and started attacking.Zhang Hao Bai looked at Luo Feng, who seemed like he was about to eat someone, and immediately howled: \u201cLuo Feng, I\u2019m warning you, you\u2014\u2014\u201d[PENG!]Luo Feng kicked sharply, his leg, like lightning, hit against Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s stomach, which caused Zhang Hao Bai to lie on the floor with his face bursting red.\u201cWarning, my ***!\u201d Luo Feng grabbed Zhang Hao Bai by the collar. His grab caused Zhang Hao Bai to be suspended in the air.\u201cYou, you\u2026..\u201d Zhang Hao Bai wanted to speak, but he was grabbed by the collar and completely suspended, which put a lot of pressure on his neck. It was already hard to breathe, so there\u2019s no way he\u2019d be able to talk.\u201cPut the owner down right now!\u201dA sound of anger came from far away. A group of around ten bodyguards fully equipped were rushing. There were cameras all over the place in the sky garden sector, so the guards knew about the fight right away. All the people living in this sector were important, so security was high.They rushed here in an instant and called the police.As Luo Feng saw the guards coming, he sneered at Zhang Hao Bai and threw him to the side like an object. Zhang Hao Bai fell onto the grass of the lawn, which colored parts of his white shirt green.\u201cDad, are you alright?\u201d Luo Feng walked towards Luo Hong Guo\u2019s side.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, just a few scratches\u201d Luo Hong Guo looked at the bodyguards who seemed to be in pain and Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s sick face and worriedly said in a low voice, \u201cFeng, how come you don\u2019t even know how to control your power. You beat them up like this, so the medical fees will surely be high. They could even sue you\u201d\u201cYea, Feng, you went a bit overboard\u201d Another worker was worried.\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, great job. They didn\u2019t even treat us like people before\u201d The other tall worker said in anger.The sector\u2019s guards knew the wealthy families well. The Zhang family\u2019s three bodyguards were all elite bodyguards and were elite members of the dojo. Now that they all suffered major injuries, they won\u2019t provoke Luo Feng for a while.Even though you get paid for being a bodyguard, nobody is willing to get beat up and have their bones fractured like those three bodyguards.[BEEP~~~BEEP~~~]Suddenly the sound of a police siren came, so everyone turned their heads and saw one police car quickly stop in front of the Zhang family\u2019s gate. The four car doors opened and four policemen sprinted out.\u201cThe police are here\u201d The guards immediately moved out of the way.\u201cNot good, the police are here\u201d Luo Hong Guo and his group were all surprised, and Luo Hong Guo dragged Luo Feng to a corner and quickly said in a low voice: \u201cFeng, you injured them, so there\u2019ll be problems once you arrive at the police station. Don\u2019t rush, I\u2019ll find you a lawyer immediately\u201d\u201cDad, I passed the prospective fighter exam\u201d Luo Feng quietly said.With just this one phrase, Luo Hong Guo who was extremely impatient immediately relaxed and let out a sigh of relief: \u201cReally? That\u2019s great. Feng, if you passed the exam, then even those policemen don\u2019t have the right to detain you?\u201dProspective fighters become fighters after taking the fighter combat exam. Once their body fitness passes, then they can train their genetic energy.So, according to the rules of the country\u2014\u2014Once a prospective fighter or a fighter gets dragged into cases, the security agency of the city takes care of things. Jiang-Nan city naturally has Jiang-Nan city\u2019s security agency take care of things, so regular policemen have no right to detain them.\u201cHowever, dad, the higher authority still needs to approve of my passing. It will take a few more days until the prospective fighter documents arrive at my home and get updated in my profile\u201d Luo Feng said quietly, \u201cSo, according to the law, I\u2019m technically not a prospective fighter right now. I\u2019ll only become one in a few more days!\u201dLuo Feng officially becomes a prospective fighter when it\u2019s recorded into his public profile.\u201cEven if there is trouble these few days, there\u2019s no problem. Contact the dojo of limits and have them vouch for me and prove that I passed the prospective fighter exam. After that, I can leave the police station immediately\u201d Luo Feng said, \u201cHowever, if there\u2019s no trouble, then there\u2019s no need to go through all that hassle. It\u2019s just a few days in the police station. After that, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay even if I wanted to\u201dLuo Hong Guo nodded.\u201cLuo Feng!\u201d The two policemen walked over and one of them reprimanded, \u201cYou dare barge into other civillian\u2019s property and injure their men! Walk, you\u2019re coming with us to the police station\u201d\u201cMy police friends, I\u2019ll cooperate\u201d Luo Feng smiled as he walked forward, \u201cLet\u2019s go. However, I\u2019m not sure if your car can fit all of us\u201dThe two policemen panicked.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have a car\u201d Zhang Hao Bai turned his head and looked towards the four policemen, \u201cUncle Liu, he attacked and injured me and my three bodyguards, we are all witnesses for that\u201d\u201cBring them all\u201dThe policeman called uncle Liu ordered.\u201cLuo Feng\u201d Zhang Hao Bai maliciously looked at Luo Feng. The rage in his heart was great. His rage has already been collecting throughout the three years of high school. Luo Feng\u2019s beating today reminded him of the time where a similar situation happened in the dojo, \u201cThis time, even death won\u2019t get you out of this. You dare injure me and my bodyguards so badly. We can even make this a case and give you a few years in prison. Let\u2019s see if you\u2019re still so arrogant then!\u201dLuo Feng smiled as he walked into the police car with the policemen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: JailThe room was empty, dark, and cold. Cold air constantly flowed in; you couldn\u2019t help but to shiver.\u201cThis is the interrogation room?\u201d Yet Luo Feng had a look of curiosity on his face as he looked around the room, \u201cThey threw me in this dark room and set the AC on such a high setting, are they trying to do some psychological warfare?\u201d Before the \u2018interrogation\u2019 even started, Luo Feng has already won!Luo Feng, who has already passed the prospective fighter exam, is unafraid of any of the police\u2019s tricks.Outside in the security room, a few policemen looked inside the room through their security cameras. One of the young female officers wondered: \u201cHead, how come this young man doesn\u2019t feel anything at all? Usually when someone enters the interrogation room and stays there for half an hour, they start panicking due to their own worries\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate him, his profile states that he is an elite member of the dojo! And he even injured four elite members!\u201d The bald middle-aged officer laughed.\u201cOne harmed four? If he\u2019s that strong, is it possible that he\u2019s a prospective fighter? If he is, then that\u2019ll be a problem\u201d said one of the young male officers.\u201cHe isn\u2019t a prospective fighter, his profile says it clearly\u201dThe bald middle-aged officer said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Xiao Yang, come with me to interrogate him for a bit\u201d\u201cYes, head\u201d\u2026\u2026Inside the interrogation room, Luo Feng has been waiting for over half an hour.\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d Luo Feng smiled as he watched the two policemen enter.The bald middle-aged officer was startled, this young man was unexpectedly calm. He came in with the other young officer and sat in front of the interrogation desk. He then smiled, saying: \u201cSorry, we were interrogating a few others just now which caused a delay. So that\u2019s why it took us so long to arrive\u201d\u201cNo problem\u201d Luo Feng then asked, \u201cWhat about the three workers from the remodeling company, where did they go?\u201d\u201cWe let them return home\u201d The bald middle-aged officer seemed friendly.Luo Feng nodded.In this case, Luo Hong Guo and his group were victims, so they were let off the hook.\u201cThe three workers from the remodeling company and Zhang Hao Bai and his three bodyguards all told us all about what happened. The truth is against you. Do you have any words?\u201d The bald middle-aged officer stared at Luo Feng. Usually, when someone hears that the truth isn\u2019t with them, they try to explain themselves.Luo Feng smiled: \u201cNothing much. Zhang Hao Bai and his three bodyguards, those four are maggots! They dared to hit my dad, so I just taught them a lesson\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d The bald middle-aged officer and the young male officer were stunned.[PENG!] The young middle-aged officer slammed the table and scolded, \u201cLuo Feng, get real. This is the police station, stop being so arrogant!\u201d\u201cArrogant? I was telling you what happened\u201d Luo Feng smiled, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s all I have to say\u201dThe bald middle-aged officer frowned: \u201cLuo Feng, your arrogance will not help your case. You purposefully injured them to such an extent, so a couple years in jail wouldn\u2019t be surprising. You better explain the events of what happened in detail\u201d\u201cI have nothing much to say\u201d Luo Feng said as he shaked his head.The bald middle-aged officer frowned. He looked at Luo Feng carefully, who remained silent. Finally, the bald middle-aged officer waved his hand and say: \u201cOkay then. Don\u2019t regret this. Take him down!\u201dLuo Feng smiled as he stood up. Two male officers rushed in the interrogation room and forcefully escorted him out.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7The Zhi-An region jail is right next to the police station. The influence of the fighters has caused today\u2019s society to fight and brawl a lot, so many people are detained here. Each region has their own jail to detain these people, and Luo Feng will be entering jail today too.After changing into the gray prisoner uniform, Luo Feng was locked up.\u201c299, this is the room. Go in\u201d The guardsman pushed Luo Feng in and locked the prison door. The people locked up here were mostly thieves, drunk drivers, brawlers, and criminals awaiting their trials.Luo Feng\u2019s case of a fight was common around here.Simply put, it was just a small fight between a few people. However, if this case is actually brought to the court, then there is indeed a chance of Luo Feng receiving a few years of imprisonment. The reason is of course\u2014\u2014Luo Feng is not a prospective fighter.In the prison cell.\u201cHeh, a new one?\u201d A bald brute with tattoos was lying on the bed. Next to him was an old man who was obediently giving him a massage. The bald brute glared at Luo Feng, \u201cKiddo, you are all skin and bones. Not bad, come and kick my shin!\u201dLuo Feng looked strangely at the bald brute. He has heard rumors of bullying in the cell, but they were only rumors. This is the first time he has witnessed such an event.\u201cDamn, are you deaf?\u201d The bald brute glared and stood up.\u201cInteresting, interesting\u201d Luo Feng was very curious.\u201cPickin\u2019 a fight?\u201d After the bald brute witnessed Luo Feng\u2019s lack of respect, he suddenly rose his palm leaf-like hand and went for Luo Feng\u2019s head.With a slight movement, Luo Feng\u2019s arm came out like a viper and grabbed the bald brute\u2019s wrist.\u201cHm? Hm?\u201d The bald brute shook violently; he felt like his arm was trapped by iron bands. He couldn\u2019t exert any strength at all and his face couldn\u2019t help but to change completely; he knew he was in deep trouble.\u201cYou want me to kick your shin?\u201d Luo Feng\u2019s right hand\u2019s fingers strengthened and twisted the bald brute\u2019s wrist, who painfully got on the ground and begged: \u201cMy brother, I failed to recognize your might. Brother, please let me off the hook. Ah, ah\u2014\u2014\u201d The intense pain made him scream out uncontrollably.Luo Feng exerted some strength and tossed the bald brute against the wall.\u201cTell me whenever you want me to kick your shin\u201d Luo Feng said in ill humor. With that, he suddenly leaped, and with some help with his right hand, he was already lying on the bed.The bald brute sat in the corner and rubbed his right arm\u2019s wrist.And the old man and the skinny young man on the bed who were also in the cell looked at the bald brute, and then looked at Luo Feng.\u201cBaldie Huang, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d The guardsman standing in front of the prison snickered, \u201cWho messed with you? How did this happen? Oh, a quick reminder, that new young man who just joined you came here after beating four elite members of the dojo. Be careful and don\u2019t provoke him\u201dAfter saying that, the guardsman hummed a small hymn and left.\u201cShoulda said that earlier\u201d The bald brute looked in fear towards the bed, \u201cOne person beat four elite members of the dojo? That\u2019s messed up\u201dMeanwhile, Luo Feng was thinking about what he read at the limit hall, about the \u2018Genetic Energy Techniques\u2019: \u201cHm, since I have nothing to do here anyway, when it gets dark, I might as well try to train my genetic energy!\u201dFighters rely on genetic energy for their unstoppable strength.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7When Luo Feng was planning his genetic energy training in his cell, inside a room in a KTV* near the Zhi-An region police station: two young men were flirting with a young women. One of them shrieked and howled as he sang. And that young man was precisely Zhang Hao Bai.\u201cAlright, you two can leave now\u201d Zhang Hao Bai waved his hand. The only people that were left in the room were Zhang Hao Bai and another teenager who was wearing glasses.\u201cBrother Zhou, I asked you here for a favor\u201d Zhang Hao Bai spoke.\u201cIf you have something to ask for then don\u2019t hold back\u201d The glasses wearing teenager laughed, \u201cIf I can help, then I definitely will do so right away\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like this, there\u2019s someone named Luo Feng! This maggot always goes against me\u201d As he was talking, Zhang Hao Bai spit in rage, \u201cThis time, he injured my three bodyguards and beat me up. Brother, I can\u2019t take this! This person is locked up in jail now, so I want to ask brother Zhou to get through the guardsmen and teach Luo Feng a lesson\u201d\u201cOh? No problem. However, I need money for the guardsmen\u2019s cooperation\u201d The glasses wearing teenager wrinkled his eyebrow.\u201cMoney is not a problem, I have a hundred thousand right here! After the task is complete, I\u2019ll give another hundred thousand\u201d Zhang Hao Bai immediately threw his wallet towards the teenager.\u201cHaha, awesome\u201d The glasses wearing teenager didn\u2019t even look at the wallet and nodded, \u201cTwo hundred thousand. We can do anything to him as long as we don\u2019t kill him. Tell me, how should we beat him up?\u201d\u201cBreak one of his legs and one of his arms!\u201d Zhang Hao Bai clenched his teeth.\u201cSure, that\u2019s easy\u201d The glasses wearing teenager immediately nodded.Zhang Hao Bai reminded: \u201cBrother Zhou, this Luo Feng is not an easy target. He beat me and my three bodyguards\u201d\u201cNo worries\u201d The glasses wearing teenager laughed in confidence, \u201cYou can put a thousand and two hundred hearts worth of trust in me and wait for the good news\u201d*TL note: for those who don\u2019t know, KTV is a place where you can rent a private room and sing along with pre-recorded videos/songs (karaoke)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Late night in jailDeep into the night. The moon and stars weren\u2019t visible in today\u2019s sky, so the cell Luo Feng resided in was completely dark. Only the roads outside of the cell had some light.[HU~~~] snores kept ringing throughout the cell, showing that virtually everyone was in deep sleep.Suddenly\u2014\u2014On the left bed, Luo Feng, who was originally lying in rest, sat up. His legs were crossed and his soles faced forwards. His hands rested on his legs and his back was perfectly straight.\u201cAccording to the article I saw at the Limit Hall, there is only one type of genetic energy training on earth\u2014\u2014Wu Xin Xian Tian training. Once someone reaches the body fitness level of a fighter, they usually are able to start their genetic energy training right away\u201d Luo Feng took in a deep breath, \u201cThe article said that the first \u2018feeling\u2019 is the hardest!\u201dTo absorb the cosmic energy, you need to be able to sense them first.According to the article, this energy is spread around the earth. Even the stars in the universe has this energy. However\u2026.. most people can\u2019t detect the presence of the energy.\u201cAs long as I can do the \u2018feeling\u2019, it\u2019ll be easy to absorb them\u201d\u201cThe talented people can sense the energies on their first day of training. The less talented fighters take up to one and a half years just to sense the energy\u201d Luo Feng adjusted his breathing and kept the position of the Wu Xin Xian Tian technique. The Wu Xin* refers to \u2018the two soles, the two palms, and the main artery in the head\u2019.*TL note: Wu Xin means Five Hearts.Breathe\u2026..Luo Feng\u2019s breathing slowly stabilized. As he stabilized himself, Luo Feng could feel his heart becoming calm.\u201cMy body has to loosen up. The Wu Xin Xian Tian is a natural process. I have to calm my heart, calm my heart like a lake in the reflection of a mirror\u201d Luo Feng\u2019s self control was good so he was able to slowly calm himself, even his heart was calmed.It was completely silent. His breathing could barely be heard.One minute, two minutes\u2026.. thirty minutes, one hour\u2026..\u201cHm?\u201d Luo Feng suddenly opened his eyes, \u201cWhere is this so called energy? How come I can\u2019t sense it? My heart and body should\u2019ve been very calm just now. Maybe, like the article said, a talented person can succeed on the first day, but an untalented person would take one and a half years to sense the energy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try again\u201d Luo Feng shut his eyes and tried to feel the energy described in the article.Relaxed, quiet.These were the two points that the Wu Xin Xian Tian technique stressed the most.\u201cStill not right\u201d Half an hour later, Luo Feng opened his eyes.Luo Feng has witnessed that the first stage of genetic energy training\u2014\u2014feeling\uff0cis very difficult.\u201cI\u2019ll try one last time. If I don\u2019t succeed I\u2019ll wait until tomorrow night. I hope I can succeed\u201d Luo Feng hoped in his heart, shut his eyes, and started to calm himself again in order to sense the energy.Time passed slowly, ten minutes\u2026.. thirty minutes\u2026.. fifty minutes\u2026.. one hour and twenty minutes\u2026..\u201cHow come it\u2019s still not working?\u201dIn his almost meditative state, Luo Feng\u2019s thoughts started to slow down too.Slowly\u2026..In this almost meditative state, Luo Feng had a bit of hope in the bottom of his heart, hoping to sense the energy. However, as time passed, Luo Feng was falling asleep! A normal person who thinks of nothing and closes his eyes for half an hour at late night would fall asleep, and Luo Feng has been going at this for three hours already.About to fall asleep, Luo Feng forgot to try and sense the energy.\u201cSo comfortable\u201dLuo Feng, who was falling asleep, felt a faint energy go through his soles, palms, and the major artery of his head. At a slow steady rate, it entered his body.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Luo Feng was still half asleep.\u201cIt\u2019s the energy!!!\u201d Luo Feng abruptly woke up and opened his eyes. The feeling he had before immediately disappeared.Luo Feng never thought that he would be able to sense the energy when he was about to fall asleep.\u201cI felt it, I felt it, that must be the energy I was looking for\u201d Luo Feng was extremely happy inside, \u201cAccording to the article, once you pass the prospective fighter test, many people can start their genetic energy training. Even if you don\u2019t sense it consciously, your body slowly absorbs it unconsciously\u201dLuo Feng knew that the feeling just now meant that he was absorbing the energy. However, this kind of absorption speed was much too slow.\u201cIt\u2019s that kind of feeling\u201dLuo Feng shut his eyes and tried to sense it again. He stabilized his breathing and calmed his heart. His consciousness focused on the soles of his feet, the palms of his hands, and the artery of his head. He tried to sense the energy he just felt.He felt like he sensed the energy, but at the same time he felt like he didn\u2019t.Slowly, the feeling was getting clearer and clearer.It\u2019s this!A very small thing like a breath floated slowly. When it neared Luo Feng\u2019s soles, it seeped in slowly.\u201cThis is the energy\u201d Luo Feng focused on the \u2018Wu Xin\u2019 and he focused on absorbing the energies. Naturally, the speed of which his soles, palms, and his head\u2019s artery absorb energy increased; it instantly neared to a hundred times the speed.If we say that the energies seeped in like a few drops of water from a crack in a water pipe at the beginning..Then now, the crack is larger and, like a small river, the energies incessantly flowed into Luo Feng\u2019s body.\u201cAh~~~\u201d The feeling made him shiver to the bone. The shapeless, colorless energy entered Luo Feng\u2019s body. The starving and thirsting cells crazily gobbled up the energy which came in from five different paths.Inside the cell.As the energies entered the cells, it was quickly absorbed by the mitochondria and at the same time, let out a strange energy. This energy was absorbed by the cell, which started causing earth shattering changes. The DNA blueprints were also beginning to change slightly, and the cell started dividing, one into two.Time passed slowly\u2026..Luo Feng\u2019s body kept changing, whether it was the surface of the skin, the muscles, the bones, and even the layers of every single cell, every part of the body has changed. This change is life\u2019s evolution, an enhancement of life\u2019s genes!\u201cAccording to the training guide, humans, starting from birth, were unable to absorb the energies. So in a state of starvation, when you absorb the energies for the first time, you absorb the highest amount. Which is also the time of the quickest strength boost!\u201d Luo Feng felt his fitness level changing.On the earth and in the entire universe, there is an infinite amount of energy. The amount of which Luo Feng just absorbed is negligible.However, to Luo Feng, this is the biggest jump in strength he has ever had.The density of his bones increased, the cells reduced their volumes and split into two, the muscle fibers were enhancing themselves, and Luo Feng\u2019s body weight kept increasing.Life, is so peculiar!In the brain.In a place where Luo Feng couldn\u2019t sense, the energies flowed in the depths of his brain. Since birth until now, the three shocks to the depths of his brain caused three comas. And tonight, a huge amount of energies were flowing in.However, this change was different from the other three times, it was more faint\u2026.. Luo Feng, who was training, didn\u2019t notice it at all.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7[DING~~DONG~~]Dawn, the sun just rose, around 5 or 6 AM. All the bells in the jail were ringing. Each prisoner began to wake up. Luo Feng, who sat cross legged for a while, finally opened his eyes and smiled: \u201cIndeed, this is the most energy I\u2019ll be able to absorb in one duration. I absorbed for almost 2 hours until my body was full\u201dLuo Feng could feel that he had much more power than before.\u201cAfter last night, I feel like my fitness level has raised even more than what my coma during exams gave me\u201d Luo Feng thought to himself, \u201cMy fist strength would probably be around 1500 kg now, maybe even higher\u201d Only tests could tell how much his strength actually increased.\u201cTime for breakfast, time for breakfast\u201d Quite a few prisoners left their cells to eat.Luo Feng jumped off his bed, brushed his teeth, and washed his face in preparation for breakfast.At this time\u2014\u2014In the hallway, three uniform wearing prisoners walked towards Luo Feng\u2019s cell. One of them yelled: \u201cBaldie Huang, I heard a highly skilled person came into your cell, beating four elite members single handedly\u201d\u201cBrother Liu, he sure is tough\u201d In Luo Feng\u2019s cell, the bald brute laughed and nodded.\u201cOh\u201dThe three prisoners exchanged glances, and one of them said in a low voice: \u201cThere\u2019s no mistake. The cell number, age, and strength are all correct. Brother Zhou was talking about him\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: Gang FightIn the jail.After eating breakfast, the prisoners started returning to their cells one by one.In the third cell from the left in the southern hallway, four prisoners lay quietly on their beds. One fatty said in a low voice: \u201cBig Brother, I talked to Boss Li during breakfast and he nodded in agreement. We\u2019ll send three of our professionals. With two of Boss Li\u2019s \u2018gorillas\u2019, we\u2019ll have five men. With that, that Luo Feng shouldn\u2019t be a problem\u201d\u201cFatty, I heard that Luo Feng could beat four elite members all by himself. He\u2019s quite a tough one\u201d A brawny man with tattoos in the shape of a black dog said quietly.\u201cBlack dog, fatty, other than us, Brother Zhou is sending out cobra. Even if we don\u2019t succeed, cobra definitely will!\u201d A one-eyed middle aged man said quietly.\u201cCobra?\u201dFatty and the brawny Black Dog were all shocked.\u201cYea. In pure coincidence, cobra is also locked up here\u201d The one-eyed man nodded.\u201cWith cobra, there\u2019s no way we can fail\u201d Fatty got excited, \u201cHowever, what does cobra look like? We\u2019ve never even seen him before\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll move together. After lunch I\u2019ll negotiate with Boss Li\u201d The one-eyed man said quietly, \u201cWithout error, we\u2019ll move together and take action at dinner time! Remember, bring your weapons\u201d However, the weapons this prisoner was talking about were just small blades formed from sharpening a tooth brush\u2026..Even though there were some strict checks in this jail, it can\u2019t compare at all to a large scale prison.However, even in a large scale prison, crafty men are almost always able to smuggle guns and ammunition in. No matter how secure the place is, as long as people run it, there\u2019ll be loopholes! Of course, the people in this jail were just some small fry. They were armed with mere blades and glass pieces.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7Evening.\u201cBrother Luo\u201d\u201cBrother Luo\u201dAs he walked out of his cell, every prisoner he met obediently greeted Luo Feng. Luo Feng\u2019s story of his battle between four elite members has spread around last night. Virtually everybody in the jail knew of this young man\u2019s strength.In the cafeteria. It\u2019s called a cafeteria, but it\u2019s just a sealed lobby.Long, stabilized, silver tables, around a couple dozen of them.\u201cEverything in this jail is pretty good, except the food\u201d Since Luo Feng succeeded in his genetic energy training last night, he has been in a good mood for the entire day. He walked to the counter and received a plastic lunch box from the guards, but only some food like mud was inside it.As he lowered his head and looked inside, there was only some food like gray mud. When he smelled it, there was the scent of potatoes.\u201cSo this is the legendary raw meal\u201d Luo Feng shaked his head.It is quite famous. But though it\u2019s called raw meal, it\u2019s actually the undisputed absolute worst food of society. If you eat this raw meal, you only need five cents a day. Just knowing that should tell you enough about the quality of the things inside it.A silver lobby, a silver table, and a silver lunch box.A large amount of uniform wearing people came one by one and received their lunch boxes.Luo Feng sat on the side of the table and lowered his head as he started to eat this raw meal. At this time, a skinny, glasses wearing teenager started cursing, \u201cEven pigs and dogs eat better food than this!\u201d as he ate two bites of the contents of the lunch box next to Luo Feng.\u201cHurry, you lost, give me two smokes\u201d\u201cWhatta ya sayin'\u201dIn the large silver lobby, over a hundred prisoners were talking to each other. It was very messy and chaotic. Two guards stood outside the railing, both holding an assault rifle. They lazily glanced inside and then started laughing and talking with each other. The security camera at the top continuously recorded all of the events of the silver lobby.[PENG] A one-eyed brute sat at a table three meters to the right of Luo Feng\u2019s. He glanced at Luo Feng and laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re Luo Feng?\u201dLuo Feng looked at the one-eyed brute in the eye: \u201cYou are?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Long\u201d The one-eyed brute grinned as he laughed.\u201cOne-eyed dragon\u201d A low voice said. A short fat man sat in front of the one-eyed brute. At this time, two brutes sat next to him like steel towers. The two brutes coldly looked into the one-eyed brute. Then, the short fat man laughed coldly, \u201cWhen we went outside to relax yesterday, your men hit my brother right? Tell us, how are we going to resolve this issue?\u201d\u201c**** off\u201d The one-eyed brute rolled his eye and lectured, \u201cFatty Li, you better get away from me this instant. If you mess with me, don\u2019t blame me for not holding back\u201dThe short fat man stared coldly and laughed: \u201cOne-eyed dragon, it seems like you don\u2019t wanna talk?\u201dLuo Feng ate two more bites on the sidelines and glanced. He couldn\u2019t help but to be interested. In his point of view\u2026.. it was clearly two major powers in the jail about to fight.\u201cTalk shit. If you still wanna talk, **** off\u201d The one-eyed dragon\u2019s only eye rolled as he lectured.\u201cScrew it, attack!\u201dThe short fat man\u2019s face was hideous as he shouted.Instantly, the two steel tower-like brutes next to him started moving. One of them lifted the long, silver table and slammed it against the one-eyed brute, while the other brute launched a kick like lightning.\u201cDare hit our boss!\u201d\u201cBrothers, let\u2019s go!\u201dThe entire lobby instantly became chaotic.[PENG!] One of the prisoners lifted the bench and ferociously slammed it on the security camera in the corner. Every time theres a large scale gang fight in the jail, the first thing you do is break the camera. WIthout concrete evidence, the police naturally can just randomly select prisoners to blame.In the silver lobby.\u201cAH!\u201d The one-eyed dragon threw out his right arm and blocked the brute\u2019s kick. However, it was a really powerful kick, so the one-eyed dragon stepped a few steps back, all the way to Luo Feng\u2019s side.The two steel tower-like brutes quickly pursued.The men under the one-eyed dragon also rushed towards this direction. Suddenly, Luo Feng was at the center of the gang fight.\u201cCan\u2019t believe I got messed up in this\u201d Luo Feng could only stand up. He was too lazy to get involved in this. It was at this time that the fatty under the one-eyed dragon\u2019s command rushed towards Luo Feng. He suddenly revealed a blade sharpened from a screw and pointed it at Luo Feng\u2019s waist.Before that, the one-eyed dragon revealed a small blade in his hand and was getting ready to thrust it at Luo Feng.\u201cHm?\u201d Luo Feng suddenly sensed danger. At the same time, he could feel a slight pain in his waist, as if something sharp has pierced his body. However, as Luo Feng tensed his muscles, he leapt up like a leopard and jumped past the table in front. But at this time\u2026..[HE] [HE]The two steel tower-like brutes launched their legs like battle axes towards Luo Feng.\u201cYou\u2019re asking for death!\u201d Luo Feng, who understood what was going on in an instant, howled in a loud voice and slammed his two fists against the two legs. The two steel-like tower brutes nicknamed \u2018gorillas\u2019 laughed coldly in their hearts. The explosive energy of the legs are way more powerful than the arm\u2019s. Would they even fear Luo Feng?[PENG] [PENG]A low striking sound, followed by the sounds of bones breaking. The two ferocious steel tower-like brutes howled in pain. The two of them flew away from Luo Feng\u2019s fists and slammed against a far away table. On the bench and floor, there were bloodstains that could shock you.\u201cAhhhh\u201d The two brutes held their legs in pain as they rolled around on the ground.\u201cWhat!\u201d The one-eyed dragon along with fatty and black dog who were beside him were all shocked.At this time.\u2014\u2014[WENG WENG] An ear piercing alarm rang. All the guardsmen in the jail rapidly rushed out of their resting areas to group up as they headed towards the cafeteria.Luo Feng touched his waist and saw that the blood has stained his uniform. The legends were right, fighters that are capable of genetic energy trainings have fist strengths of three to four thousand kg. A regular, small bullet are incapable of piercing through their muscles. The fatty\u2019s knife only went through Luo Feng\u2019s skin and was stopped by his muscles.\u201cSo you guys were putting on a play\u201dLuo Feng glanced at the one-eyed dragon and the short fat man, his eyes filled with ferocity, which caused the both of them to go pale from shock.\u201cEveryone at him, he\u2019s injured!\u201d The one-eyed dragon shouted in rage.\u201cEveryone together!\u201d The short fat man also howled loudly. As they shouted, they lifted benches to slam Luo Feng with. Following their bosses actions, the other men naturally started to rush together with their own benches.Luo Feng\u2019s movements were like a phantom\u2019s, his two legs were like cannon shots, kicking every prisoner into the air. For the regular prisoners, Luo Feng wasn\u2019t too cruel, since they were just following orders. However, Luo Feng would not show any mercy to the two leaders and the fatty who stabbed him.[PU!] Luo Feng\u2019s chop broke the bench in half and his arm slammed on the one-eyed dragon\u2019s, causing him to fly up in the air. His arm made a counter clockwise 90 degree turn.People were all being launched into the air, benches and tables were being twisted and shattered one by one.The difference!This is the difference between a fighter who has trained in the genetic energy techniques and regular aggressive convicts.As Luo Feng scanned the group of prisoners, the skinny glasses wearing teenager who was silently watching suddenly waved his hand.\u201cLay off!\u201dAs a cold light passed through the sky, he was already in front of Luo Feng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: AwakenThe skinny teenager was Zhi-An region\u2019s famous \u2018Cobra\u2019*. His rise to fame is his one handed throwing knife technique. When the other prisoners started mobbing Luo Feng, the cobra teenager searched for the best opportunity to strike. Right when Luo Feng was getting out of hand, he attacked!The thrown knife was very sinister. As it flew, it was blocked by a prisoner\u2019s body, so Luo Feng didn\u2019t even realize what was coming for him.TL Note: Cobra in chinese is literally \u201cGlasses snake\u201d.[XIU!] The knife flew between the gap of a prisoner\u2019s pants who was thrown up by Luo Feng. When Luo Feng saw the knife, it was only 2 meters away!\u201cNot good!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t make it\u201d Luo Feng\u2019s reaction speed was fast, but he didn\u2019t have enough time to move his body out of the way.The knife wasn\u2019t aiming for any vital organs, but for Luo Feng\u2019s right shoulder.\u201cNO!\u201d Luo Feng glanced. For a fighter, his arms are extremely important. Luo Feng uses knives and is right handed. If the knife breaks through the joint and splits the bone, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to use his techniques against the beasts for a few months.In other words, if he gets hit, he wouldn\u2019t be able to participate in the August 1st fighter combat exam; he would have to wait until next year\u2019s February 1st.\u201cNO! Get out of the way!!!\u201dWith the knife\u2019s speed and the three meter distance, Luo Feng\u2019s thoughts weren\u2019t thinking about the consequences at all. At this exact second, at this crucial moment, Luo Feng\u2019s spirit tightened and all of his muscles were pushed to the extreme. He stared at the knife with only one goal in mind\u2014\u2014Dodge this knife, don\u2019t let this knife hit my shoulder![PU!]The knife, which was right about to hit Luo Feng, strangely and mysteriously slightly changed direction. It was about to make a direct hit with Luo Feng\u2019s shoulder, but now it only grazed it and damaged Luo Feng\u2019s first layer of skin. The blood slowly dyed Luo Feng\u2019s uniform at the shoulder area.\u201cEverybody down on their knees, everybody down on their knees!\u201d\u201cHurry and get down\u201dAt this time, a large amount of assault rifle wielding guardsmen rushed into the lobby. All the prisoners, who were previously out of control, obediently kneeled. Even that skinny \u2018cobra\u2019 teenager kneeled. He looked at Luo Feng with a shocked face: \u201cHow could this happen, how did my knife miss?\u201dSeeing the police rush in, even Luo Feng immediately kneeled.\u201cHow did the knife change direction just now?\u201d Luo Feng, who was kneeling, was confused. However, a horrible headache without any prior warnings manifested. The pain was as if someone was pounding a spike into Luo Feng\u2019s brain. The pain caused Luo Feng\u2019s entire body to cramp and he fell on the ground.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cYou guys come look with me\u201dThe police, who already had the situation under control, were astonished at Luo Feng\u2019s look. Luo Feng was completely red and was sweating a lot. Some blood even come out instead of sweat, which caused Luo Feng\u2019s uniform to turn almost completely red. His veins were bursting like a blue snake coiling around Luo Feng, which made him look unprecedentedly hideous.\u201cNot good, he\u2019s already out\u201d\u201cHurry, hurry and send him to the medical room\u201dEven though Luo Feng lost consciousness, his body was still completely red.In Luo Feng\u2019s mind.A huge, mysterious power continuously surged from Luo Feng\u2019s mind and instantly merged with every spot in Luo Feng\u2019s body. Under the baptism of this mysterious power, Luo Feng\u2019s bones, organs, blood, muscles, and skin were undergoing drastic changes. Even every cell was changing rapidly. This rate of change was hundreds to thousands of times faster compared to Luo Feng\u2019s genetic energy training. In theory, such drastic change should tear apart the body.However, as the mysterious power merged, Luo Feng\u2019s insides were completely unharmed, despite his cramps, loss of blood, etc.\u201cHurry, carefully, send him to the medical room\u201d The police started to carry Luo Feng to the medical room.The mess caused by the large scale gang fight was quickly cleaned out.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d78 PM.In the eerie three story jail, there was a movie being played on a 200 inch screen in the lobby on the first floor.\u201cStop\u201dA middle-aged man said as he sat on the sofa while wearing pajamas. Immediately, the movie being played was paused. At this time, a knocking noise came from outside.\u201cCome in\u201d The door opened and a man wearing a military uniform came in and greeted, \u201cOfficer, we investigated everything about this time\u2019s large gang fight. Zhou Hua Yang organized this to deal with the young man named Luo Feng. However, the result was a large amount of people injured in battle against Luo Feng, some even have major wounds\u201d\u201cThat Zhou Hua Yang kid? Using his Zhou family\u2019s influence, he\u2019s quite cocky\u201d The pajama wearing middle-aged man said indifferently.\u201cEven though Zhou Hua Yang organized this, we estimate that the young man named Zhang Hao Bai is the true person behind this\u201d The military officer said respectfully, \u201cWe flipped through Luo Feng\u2019s files. His reason for being locked up is related to Zhang Hao Bai, so the chances of Zhang Hao Bai asking Zhou Hua Yang for help is quite high\u201dChina has six major cities at the moment.Since humanity has gathered together like never before, the country\u2019s control over their citizens increased.\u201cHowever, officer, our investigation of the gang fight\u2019s battle scene, the metal benches and tables marks show that Luo Feng\u2019s fitness level has no doubt reached a fighter\u2019s\u201d The military officer said with confidence and persuasion. All of the benches and tables in the jail were made out of metal.Luo Feng\u2019s fists completely deformed the tables and his one chop cut the benches in half.How fearsome is this!\u201cA level of a fighter?\u201d The middle-aged man who was indifferent up to now suddenly stood up and frowned as he stared at the officer, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cA hundred percent sure!\u201d The military officer replied, \u201cI just called the thunder dojo and the dojo of limits to confirm it. Luo Feng has taken the prospective fighter exam and passed! It\u2019s just that his profile isn\u2019t updated, but I\u2019m sure it will be in these few days\u201d\u201cA prospective fighter? What did he come running to a jail for if he\u2019s a prospective fighter?\u201d The middle-aged man frowned, \u201cIf things really heat up, then there\u2019ll be a huge problem\u201dAll fighters, no matter who, take their rights seriously.If a fighter suffered losses because of the police system, then all of the fighters will be unhappy. There\u2019ll be big trouble then. Since the police do not have the right to make any sort of detainment against fighters.\u201cWhere is this Luo Feng person?\u201d said the middle-aged man.\u201cHe has had a weird headache sickness since he was young. It happened during his high school exams and now it just happened again. However, everything is fine now. He is still in a coma in the medical room\u201d replied the military officer.The middle-aged man thought for a bit and ordered: \u201cImmediately bring Luo Feng to the military personnel recuperation region and let him rest! After he wakes up, bring me to make a personal apology. Tomorrow morning, we\u2019ll contact the dojo of limits he resides at and explain everything. We must keep the situation under control! After that, we\u2019ll send him home.\u201cYes, officer\u201d the military officer went to carry out his orders and left.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7Late night.Luo Feng\u2019s eyes made a few slight movements and then opened as he sat alone in the gloomy room.\u201cWhere is this?\u201d Luo Feng suddenly came to and scanned the surroundings. The spots on the fence outside the window were clear and the neighbor\u2019s television\u2019s volume was extremely high. Luo Feng could even hear the conversations outside on the side walk.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re loud, it\u2019s that my hearing has improved by a lot\u201dLuo Feng got off the bed and stood up. As he walked around in the room, his sight, hearing, and even sense of smell improved by an amazing amount.Luo Feng\u2019s gaze landed on a stool beside him. WIth a heartbeat, he felt a formless energy instantly take control of the stool. This formless energy was unable to be sensed, but Luo Feng himself could feel it clearly: This formless energy came from his mind.\u201cWhat is this power? How did I get this kind of power?\u201d Luo Feng could feel his heart beat faster as he felt the supernatural power act like a formless hand.[HU!]At this time of the night, the stool actually started floating.With Luo Feng\u2019s one thought, the entire bed beside him started floating. He turned his head to a television, and even it started floating too. Soon after were three chairs, a tea making machine, and the cabinet beside him. All of them were floating above the ground.Very quickly\u2014\u2014Almost everything in this room was floating above the ground, like in space where there\u2019s no gravity.\u201cI can make all of these things float and yet not feel challenged or tired at all?\u201d Luo Feng slowly walked to the balcony. It was late at night and completely silent. Luo Feng\u2019s gaze landed upon a fence, and with one thought.[KA!]One of the columns of the fence started rotating and it detached itself from the fence. The column\u2019s front part, under Luo Feng\u2019s gaze, started twisting and turning and turned sharp; it became a steel needle. All of this was floating in mid air with the formless power.\u201cGo!\u201d Luo Feng thought.This column moved like lightning and shot towards a fake mountain in a small region. In amazing speed, the needle pierced through the boulder on the fake mountain. After piercing through, it turned around and flew straight through the hole it made.[WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!]The steel needle was like an uncountable number of phantoms as it pierced the fake mountain. As if pierced through a huge amount of armor piercing bullets, the mountain quickly became a sieve.[PENG!] There was suddenly the sound of an explosion.The fake mountain that was two to three meter high burst open and became countless, little shattered rocks. The needle that Luo Feng was controlling also blew up and became powder.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d[WU WU ~~~ WU WU~~~] The entire recuperation area\u2019s sirens were going off. A large amount of lights were lit up and quite a few assault rifle wielding guardsmen rushed over.Luo Feng immediately ran back to the bed in his room, still shocked and awed: \u201cThat rock which was easily two meters thick was pierced through in an instant! My needle\u2019s power was like a heavy PiMei sniper rifle shooting through armor. The needle wasn\u2019t sturdy enough so it turned into powder as it pierced through the fake mountain\u201d\u201cI pierced through it a hundred times in just one instant. Wouldn\u2019t that be like shooting a hundred armor piercing bullets ?\u201d Luo Feng took a deep breath, \u201cJust, just what is happening?\u201dThat mysterious, fearsome power, in this regular military recuperation area, has awakened!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Dark, Golden BallNo lights were turned on in the gloomy room.In utter darkness, Luo Feng sat on the sofa. He was unable to calm down: \u201cThis power is too powerful. A regular pistol could only make a dent out of that huge boulder. With my needle, I easily destroyed the fake mountain; it\u2019s power is easily tens to hundreds of times stronger!\u201dIn the war between man and beast that has lasted for a couple dozen years, man couldn\u2019t achieve victory because the beasts are too strong.There are weak and strong monsters in their horde.Even the weakest monsters can shake off the pistol\u2019s attacks. Even the weakest fighter can block the bullet with just their muscles. For the stronger monsters, even military grade weapons cannot harm them. Only heavy class sniper rifles, huge barreled heavy machine guns, high rate of fire machine guns, cannons, etc, can harm them!Of course, the top monsters like the \u2018Black crowned eagle\u2019 wouldn\u2019t even lose a feather after withstanding a barrage from the 20mm fire-god cannon! That, is truly terrifying.\u201cI can\u2019t believe I have telekinesis, this, could this be\u2026..\u201d Luo Feng\u2019s heart skipped a beat, \u201cCould it be a spirit reader\u2019s \u2018spiritual force\u2019?\u201dLuo Feng knew very little about spirit readers.However, he knew some basic information. Spirit readers were usually powerful fighters who also trained their genetic energy! However, spirit readers not only train the basic genetic energy, but also their second power\u2014\u2014telekinesis\uff01This telekinesis is called by most, \u2018spiritual force\u2019.\u201cHowever, I\u2019ll have to check later if it\u2019s actually spiritual force\u201d Luo Feng thought.Luo Feng has only seen one spirit reader since birth.And that is the mysterious black robed person chief instructor \u2018Wu Tong\u2019 called captain in Yang Zhou city\u2019s limit hall.\u201cThe needle\u2019s power was powerful, but it would be no use against the black crowned eagle. Only a high intensity laser cannon or nuclear weapons could pose a threat to them\u201d Luo Feng was clear that, even though his current power was amazing, there are tens to hundreds to thousands of even more powerful existences on earth!According to the internet, the strongest fighter who slayed the black crowned eagle\u2014\u2014His speed surpasses the speed of sound! He can cut the black crowned eagle in half with just a knife! One kick could destroy a six story apartment!This is the strongest person within all the fighters.\u201cThe strongest fighter \u2018Hong\u2019, the second strongest \u2018Thunder God\u2019, are treated as equals by the five major countries!\u201d Luo Feng took a deep breath. For a country to treat one person as an equal, it\u2019s obvious that their powers are insanely high.\u201cMy needle probably can\u2019t even touch their bodies\u201d Luo Feng reminded himself: Even though he was powerful, there are still many other powerful people.Even though he reminded himself this\u2026..Those fighters are too far ahead for Luo Feng to comprehend. Luo Feng\u2019s current power is enough for his family to live a great life.\u201cWork hard!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still young, so I might be able to stand in the circle of the strongest fighters in the future\u201d Luo Feng thought with excitement.\u2026..In this gloomy room, Luo Feng has awakened, so he was too excited to sleep.\u201cWhatever, I\u2019m too worked up to sleep now. I guess I\u2019ll do some genetic energy training\u201d Luo Feng got into the Wu Xin Xian Tian position and closed his eyes to start training.His body already has some genetic energy and he has previous experience.So it was very easy to sense the energy.The genetic energy flowed through his soles, palms, and the artery of his head, \u201cIt seems like the rate of absorption is faster today\u201d. The energy followed the five paths into Luo Feng\u2019s body. Every cell in every location gulped down this mysterious energy.With the mitochondrial conversion, the energy turned into genetic energy.\u201cEh? My head\u2026..\u201d Luo Feng could feel that a large amount of energy flowed into his brain and gathered there.[HONG!]After something like a tremor of a soul, Luo Feng surprisingly found out\u2026.. that his consciousness has moved to a very mysterious place.This mysterious place had no borders or walls, it was just an infinite expanse of fog. In this fog, there was a dark, golden ball. This dark, golden ball was like a star that slowly rotated by itself, while releasing a stream of fog. This mysterious place\u2019s fog kept increasing.\u201cThis fog\u2026.. is, is the spiritual force?\u201d Luo Feng easily felt the energy in the fog; it was his spiritual force that he used to control things.\u201cAlso\u2014\u2014\u201dLuo Feng clearly saw a stream of transparent energy leak into this mysterious place; the energy quickly assimilated into the fog\u2019s energy. Luo Feng could feel that the transparent energy was the cosmic energy.\u201cThis fog is the spiritual force, and this transparent energy is the cosmic energy. The cosmic energy is sucked into here and transformed into spiritual force. My spiritual force extends from my brain\u201d Luo Feng was shocked, \u201cThis place is my brain? Or should I say, my conscious realm?\u201dThe conscious realm is a special title fighters use for the mind.\u201cWhy is there a dark, golden ball in the middle of my conscious realm?\u201d Luo Feng observed as this dark golden ball constantly rotated by itself and released the fog (spiritual force). As it released the spiritual force, Luo Feng\u2019s mind was also comfortable.\u201cThis dark, golden ball might be the cause for all my comas\u201d Luo Feng had an intuition.\u201cA dark, golden ball releasing spiritual force?\u201d\u201cIn the past, I didn\u2019t have any spiritual force. I only had it after this time\u2019s coma\u201d Luo Feng thought, \u201cThen with this time\u2019s coma, this dark, golden ball released a large amount of spiritual force. Not only did it grant me the power of telekinesis, but it also enhanced my body\u201dHis fitness level was strong, but compared to telekinesis, it was nothing.\u201cRIght\u201d\u201cWhen the prisoners were attacking me, one of them threw a knife. That knife suddenly changed direction when it was about to pierce through my shoulder. I guess that was because of my spiritual force\u201d Luo Feng easily deducted the truth from the situation.Indeed, the dark, golden ball did release a large amount of spiritual force from this time\u2019s coma.However, when Luo Feng first started doing genetic energy training on his first night in jail, the cosmic energy started triggering changes in his conscious realm. Even without the throwing knife, the dark, golden ball was already releasing a large amount of spiritual force. As time passed, it built up and gave him the power of telekinesis.The throwing knife attack only caused Luo Feng to awaken earlier.\u201cThere\u2019s a 90% chance that this dark, golden ball was acting up and caused my comas as a result. However, now that the dark, golden ball is constantly releasing spiritual force, I shouldn\u2019t be going into a coma anymore\u201d Luo Feng thought that, like a dam holding back water, the dark, golden ball couldn\u2019t release any spiritual force.Because of that, Luo Feng had headaches every day. Now that there\u2019s a channel for the water to drain out, there\u2019s naturally no problem anymore.\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7Dawn of day two. When Luo Feng was leaving the room and went down stairs, he realized there was someone sitting in the lobby.\u201cGood morning, Mr. Luo Feng\u201d A man in a military uniform stood up and smiled.\u201cHello\u201d Luo Feng said suspiciously, \u201cWhere is this place, how did I get here? Also, I think I\u2019ve never met you before\u201dThe military officer smiled: \u201cLet me introduce myself. I am Zhi-An region\u2019s jail\u2019s Tong An. This is my Zhi-An region\u2019s military recuperation area. Mr. Luo Feng\u2026.. I can\u2019t believe that you already passed the prospective fighter exam. Of course, our jail has no right to keep Mr. Luo Feng here, so Mr. Luo Feng has the right to go home now\u201d\u201cGo home now?\u201d Luo Feng nodded.Luo Feng wasn\u2019t surprised, since when he beat up so many prisoners yesterday and especially when he left so many dents on the metal tables, it was easy for people to realize his true strength.\u201cI want to ask, who was behind all of this?\u201d Luo Feng frowned.The military officer hesitated.\u201cIf your jail cannot answer, I will contact the dojo of limits and go through Jiang-Nan city\u2019s security agency to find everything out\u201d said Luo Feng. Once this matter goes out, people will know that a prospective fighter was locked up in a jail and mobbed by prisoners and that the jail tried to hide the offenders.In the higher authorities of the jail, there\u2019ll definitely be trouble.The military officer laughed: \u201cDon\u2019t rush, Mr. Luo Feng. It\u2019s like this, according to our investigations, a gang leader named \u2018Zhou Hua Yang\u2019 organized this attack. According to our investigation, they wanted to break Mr. Luo Feng\u2019s arm and leg\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Luo Feng frowned, \u201cBreak my arm and leg? How cruel, they want to take me out? I don\u2019t even know this Zhou Hua Yang, who made him do it?\u201dThe military officer replied: \u201cWe have already interrogated Zhou Hua Yang. A teenager named Zhang Hao Bai asked him to do it\u201d\u201cZhan Hao Bai?\u201dLuo Feng\u2019s gaze was cold, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know when to quit!\u201d\u201cIndeed, he doesn\u2019t\u201d The military officer smiled, \u201cLuo Feng, you can choose to go through Jiang-Nan city\u2019s security agency to detain Zhang Hao Bai. He was the mastermind of a plot to harm a prospective fighter, which is a heavy crime! It\u2019s normal for him to get 20 years in prison\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t blame me for speaking out of turn, but Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s uncle is also a fighter!\u201d said the military officer, \u201cLuo Feng, you can choose to make his uncle lose face and ask the security agency to detain Zhang Hao Bai\u2026.. since the security agency deals with all the fighters\u2019 matters and have immense power. Zhang Hao Bai\u2019s uncle cannot influence the actions of the security agency at all\u201d\u201cYou can choose to make an enemy out of his uncle and deal with Zhang Hao Bai\u201d\u201cYou can also negotiate with him in private and make the Zhang family pay money. All of this will be decided by you, Luo Feng\u201d The military officer smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s all I had to say. Your cell phone and other belongings are all right here, Mr. Luo Feng\u201dLuo Feng nodded.To negotiate in private and make him pay a large sum of money?

    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the day that Luo Feng was released, the two people Zhou Hua Yang and Zhang Hao Bai were in a room in an exotic tea house.\"Brother Zhou, is something wrong? You called me here so early in the morning\" Zhang Hao Bai said in a quiet, low voice, \"Did that thing have results? If you did, then rest assured brother Zhou. There is absolutely no problem with the money part\" Zhang Hao Bai was looking forward to whether or not Luo Feng's arm and leg were broken.Zhou Hua Yang sat there with a gloomy face, not saying anything.\"Brother Zhou?\"Zhang Hao Bai felt that there was something weird with the mood and quietly said, \"Brother Zhou, why, why don't you say anything?\"\"Zhang Hao Bai, how cruel. You were tired of living and tried to drag me down with you\" Zhou Hua Yang looked coldly at Zhang Hao Bai.\"What, what did I do?\" Zhang Hao Bai's mind was blank as he nervously said, \"Brother Zhou, what's going on? Tell me clearly\" Zhang Hao Bai knew that something was off because of Zhou Hua Yang's attitude and face, but he didn't know exactly what happened.Zhou Hua Yang took in a deep breath and said quietly: \"Zhang Hao Bai, you told me to break Luo Feng's leg and arm, right?\"\"Yes, what?\" Zhang Hao Bai said as he nodded his head.\"Hmph, what?\" Zhou Hua Yang said coldly as he sneered, \"That Luo Feng you want to deal with, is a prospective fighter!\"\"Prospective fighter?\" Zhang Hao Bai went completely blank for a moment.Silence.The room was completely silent. Zhang Hao Bai's face was pale and he sat there without moving a hair; balls of sweat constantly leaked out of his forehead.Zhou Hua Yang laughed coldly on the side as he sipped his tea, not saying anything.\"How could this, how could this happen?\" Zhang Hao Bai's feelings of jealousy were completely gone. The only feeling he had left was fear! His family was rich, so he was clear about the prospective fighters' privileges..... For him to have sent people to break a prospective fighter's arm and leg, the prospective fighter can go through the Jiang-Nan city security agency and detain him!Once he enters the security agency, his life is ruined!\"No, no.....\" Zhang Hao Bai's face was completely pale.\"You're finally scared and shocked speechless?\" Zhou Hua Yang angrily slammed the cup onto the table and yelled, \"Fuck, if this piece of trash really wants to die, then don't drag me down with you! A prospective fighter, you sent me to break a prospective fighter's arm and leg. If he reports this to the security agency, I'm in big trouble too!\"Zhou Hua Yang angrily clenched his teeth.\"Brother Zhou, what should I do? What on earth should I do?\" said Zhang Hao Bai, \"I, I don't want to get captured to the security agency. Tell me, what on earth should I do?\"The security agency.....For regular citizens, it is a mysterious yet horrifying place. If you get captured by them, your life is practically over.\"Oh yea, brother Zhou, did you rat me out?\" Zhang Hao Bai's eyes flashed. If only Zhou Hua Yang knew that Zhang Hao Bai sent him to do this, then he still has some hope if he didn't get ratted out.\"What the fuck are you thinking you dog?\" Zhou Hua Yang angrily said as he stood up and pointed at Zhang Hao Bai, \"The government's men were interrogating me and I still dare not say? If I don't, then I'll die for you!!!\"Zhang Hao Bai froze.Indeed, if Zhou Hua Yang didn't tell the truth, then he would be in huge trouble.\"I only came and told you this because we have been together for so many years. At least you'll know what's going on when you get captured by the security agency\" Zhou Hua Yang sneered, \"I advise you to go back and discuss this with your father. Your father has more connections, so he'll definitely have a higher chance of doing something about this compared to you. Brother..... your brother Zhou won't stay here any longer, I'll be going ahead! I already paid the bill, so you don't have to pay\"After saying that, Zhou Hua Yang directly opened the door and walked out.Only Zhang Hao Bai was left in the room.\"How could this happen?\" Zhang Hao Bai sat on the chair and shaked his head, still unable to believe what was happening, \"How, how could he be a prospective fighter! Before high school exams, he only had a fist strength of 800 kg. Just in these few days? How did he become a prospective fighter?\"\"No, no, I don't want to get captured by the security agency\"\"Dad, dad..... I need to go find my dad\"Zhang Hao Bai dashed out of the tea house with a pale face and sprinted home as fast as he could.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdAt home.Zhang Hao Bai sat on the living room's sofa with both fists clenched and his body shaking.[KA!] The door was opened.\"Hao Bai, what did you call me so urgently for? And you even said if I come late, you'll die?\" Zhang Ze Long hastily ran home from the company. When he saw the look on his son's face, he got goosebumps as he thought, \"Not good. This kid Hao Bai must've got caught in something huge\"\"Dad, I'm in trouble\" Zhang Hao Bai lifted his head and looked at his father.Just these few, simple words--I'm in trouble.Made Zhang Ze Long's heart go cold.\"Tell me, exactly what happened. Tell me specifically and leave absolutely nothing out. Say everything clearly\" Zhang Ze Long's expression became serious. Even though he knew there was trouble, he didn't panic. He did survive through the Grand Nirvana period, so what kind of things hasn't he seen before?Zhang Hao Bai took in a deep breath: \"It's like this, last time in our garden, a remodeling company came to move our furniture.....\"From the start to the end, Zhang Hao Bai hid nothing and said everything.\"You, you actually tried to beat up a prospective fighter?\" Zhang Ze Long stared.\"I, I didn't know\" When Zhang Hao Bai saw his father stare like this, he panicked, \"If I knew, then even if you beat me to death I wouldn't have done it!\"Zhang Ze Long took in a deep breath, and without saying anything, took out his cell phone to make a call.[BEEP~~ BEEP~~][BEEP!]This sound came from Zhang Ze Long's cell phone. Zhang Ze Long couldn't help but to frown.\"What happened, dad?\" Zhang Hao Bai asked.\"I called your uncle, but he's hunting monsters outside the city\" Zhang Ze Long sat on the sofa, \"Wait for your uncle to call back\"Outside the city, nobody knows where a monster could be hiding.So usually, people find a safe area first before contacting people in the city.One moment later--\"Big bro, what's wrong?\" A low voice rang, \"I'm a bit busy right now\"\"Hu, this time's matter is big. Your nephew messed up hard\" Zhang Ze Long said, his eyes red.\"What did Hao Bai do? Big bro, tell me, I'm listening\" the sound came from Zhang Ze Long's brother 'Zhang Ze Hu'.\"It's like this\" Zhang Ze Long immediately repeated everything that his son just told him.After a brief silence, Zhang Ze Hu's voice carried over: \"Hao Bai this kid, dare cause trouble with a prospective fighter. That was too daring! Okay, from now on, stay home every day Hao Bai. Do not cause anymore trouble outside. And do not make contact with that Luo Feng\"\"Ok, uncle\" Zhang Hao Bai, as if he was holding on to his last straw, nodded in agreement.\"Okay, you guys don't do anything\" The sound from the cell phone continued, \"Wait for me to come home. Even if the security agency comes and captures you, don't do anything. Wait for me to come back no matter what. My current mission is quite important, so I estimate that I'll need another one to two months before I can come back\"\"Okay\" Zhang Hao Bai nodded.\"Rest assured, Hao Bai! You're my big bro's only child, I'll do everything in my power to protect you\" The sound from the cell phone continued, \"Big bro, my captain is calling me, so I won't say anymore. Remember, do not do anything and wait for me to come back\"The call ended. It was only now that Zhang Ze Long and Zhang Hao Bai could let out a breath.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe Zhang family was panicking, but the Luo family was happy.After dinner.Luo Feng brought his brother Luo Hua downstairs and walked as he pushed the wheelchair.\"Brother, we've been living in this area for around a dozen years. Dad and mom have been living here for over twenty years\" Luo Hua raised his head and looked at the apartment. The apartment was packed and had little vegetation. \"After we leave this place and go into that Ming-Yue area, I want to come out and walk around by myself\"Going up and down the stairs every day was an unbelievably hard task for the handicapped Luo Hua.\"Okay\" Luo Feng smiled as he nodded and pushed the wheelchair, \"Hua, we'll finally be exposed to the sun, we finally can get out that small room. and mom and dad finally won't have to sleep on the couch\"Luo Hua nodded.They have wished for this day..... for so long.\"Someone's coming\" Luo Hua raised his head and looked forwards. A young teenager wearing glasses smiled as he walked over. He first smiled to the handicapped Luo Hua and then looked at Luo Feng, \"Brother Luo, right?\"\"You are?\" Luo Feng looked at him suspiciously.The teenage boy smiled; \"Hello, brother Luo. My name is Zhou Hua Yang! Does brother Luo have some time for us to find a place and chat?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Zhou Hua Yang?\" Luo Feng's heart skipped a beat, \"So it was him!\"The military officer from the jail said that Zhang Hao Bai asked Zhou Hua Yang to organize the attack.\"You are Zhou Hua Yang?\" Luo Feng let out a small smile.Zhou Hua Yang got goosebumps. He panicked under Luo Feng's gaze. There was no way he couldn't panic; if Luo Feng really wanted to deal with him, he would be in huge trouble. Zhou Hua Yang kept his smile on: \"Yes, that is me. Brother Luo, shall we go find a place to chat?\"\"That's fine\" Luo Feng nodded, \"I have some things to say to you too\"\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdOn a street not too far from the Southern shore region was a 'Yang Zhou spa hotel'. This place is quite expensive; even a small suite costs at least a thousand dollars. Luo Feng has heard of this place, but has never actually entered it himself. And this time he brought his brother and Zhou Hua Yang.The Yang Zhou spa hotel was a place to take baths, wash your feet, and enjoy entertainment all in area.\"Okay, you can go now. I'll call you if anything comes up\" Zhou Hua Yang ordered in a particular room in the spa hotel.\"Yes, mister\" The waiter left.There were three rooms in this suite: A bathroom designed especially for baths, a resting room where you can drink tea and discuss matters, and an entertainment room where you can go on the internet, watch television, and sing.\"Hua, just play in this room, I'm going to discuss some things with Zhou Hua Yang\" Luo Feng smiled.\"Go, brother\"Luo Hua moved his wheelchair in front of the computer and was a bit excited, \"Wow, a 46 inch flat screen with a voice recognition system. Awesome\"Luo Feng was also amazed, his laptop at home was one of the worst kinds. The controls were still done by hand. However, it was cheap; just a few hundred dollars for one. Now virtually all of the laptops are controlled by voice, and the highest quality ones even had a 'Three dimensional hologram projection system'Of course, for a device to be able to project holograms, it would be immensely expensive. For this legendary device, even a rich family would go broke from just buying one.Luo Hua was excited to use the voice recognition system as he sat in front of the computer. And Luo Feng and Zhou Hua Yang entered the resting room.[KA] The door was closed and Luo Feng and Zhou Hua Yang sat across from each other.\"Brother Luo, have some tea\" Zhou Hua Yang lifted the teapot and, as he poured tea into Luo Feng's cup, he said with a look of shame, \"Brother Luo, I came here to apologize to brother Luo! For this time's incident...... ugh, Truthfully, I am really sorry and I regret it a lot!\"Luo Feng held his cup as he listened silently.Zhou Hua Yang......There are many of these types of people in society. What they do is do tasks for others in return for money. For example, Zhou Hua Yang also did his task for money; he had no grudges against Luo Feng at all. Luo Feng wasn't that mad towards Zhou Hua Yang. Who Luo Feng truly hated was Zhang Hao Bai.\"Even if that Zhang Hao Bai didn't find Zhou Hua Yang to deal with me, he would've found someone else\" Luo Feng thought to himself, \"This Zhou Hua Yang is just a middleman. However..... since he came to find me, I might as well see it through\"Zhou Hua Yang saw how Luo Feng was silent and continued talking, \"I had no idea about the circumstances when I organized the attack against brother Luo. It was all because of Zhang Hao Bai I did this stupid act! I hope brother Luo can be generous and have mercy on me\"\"Mercy?\" Luo Feng sneered.\"This is just a tiny gift from me, I hope brother Luo can accept it\" Zhou Hua Yang took out an envelope and pushed it across the table towards Luo Feng, \"This is a check with brother Luo's name on it. Only brother Luo can take out this money. You can get the money from any bank\"Luo Feng opened the envelope and there was indeed a check inside. There was a 10 day expiration date and it had his name on it. It even had Luo Feng's identification number on it.Of course, the most attractive part of it was that one line--One million!\"One million?\" Luo Feng was slightly startled, for this was a huge amount of money. Luo Feng has never saved over a hundred thousand dollars. Now that Chinese dollars are worth more, one million is a lot to even the CEOs.\"I hope brother Luo can forgive me and let this thing slide by\" Zhou Hua Yang pleaded.A million......Luo Feng's family never had this much money before; it would be a waste to not accept it.\"I know you are a middleman, so I won't make it difficult for you. Okay, I'll accept the money\" Luo Feng nodded and Zhou Hua Yang slightly let out a breath.\"However, getting the money from a check is a bit troublesome. How about this, go through the internet right now and transfer it to my account\" said Luo Feng.\"Sure\" Zhou Hua Yang was straightforward.Luo Feng nodded and, with a pen on the side of the table, wrote down his bank account and the address of the bank: \"This is my account and the address is here. The person who created the account is me\"\"Okay\" Zhou Hua Yang took back the envelope and took out his cell phone. Through the cell phone, he quickly got online and entered the bank system. Soon after, the transfer was a success.Luo Feng felt his phone vibrate in his pocket and opened it. He saw a text message which was a bank notification telling him that his balance has increased by a million dollars.\"Did it transfer successfully?\" Zhou Hua Yang smiled.\"Yea\" Luo Feng nodded.Zhou Hua Yang smiled: \"Doing stuff with brother Luo is just simple and nice. In this Yang Zhou city, if brother Luo ever has some difficulty, feel free to find me. If I can help, I definitely will. Of course, brother Luo will become a fighter soon, but you never know. If something happens, it might be easier if we deal with it instead\"\"Will do. If something comes up I'll contact you\" Luo Feng stood up.Zhou Hua Yang also immediately stood up, and the two of them shook hands.\"Then I'll be going first\" Zhou Hua Yang smiled, \"I already paid the bill for this suite, so brother Luo can play until next morning\" Zhou Hua Yang also greeted Luo Feng's brother 'Luo Hua' and then left the suite.In the entertainment room of the suite.\"Brother, what did that guy want with you?\" Luo Hua laughed, \"It seems that he's quite generous\".\"He came to give us money\" Luo Feng laughed.\"Give money?\" Luo Hua was shocked.Luo Feng didn't tell his family of any of the events that occurred in the jail, since he didn't want them to worry. Luo Feng thought..... that since he has already started the path of a fighter, this path will be filled with trials, dangers, and difficulties, so it would be better to not tell them.\"Yea. Oh, Luo Hua\" Luo Feng laughed, \"How's your stock going?\"Since Luo Hua is usually home, he took a great interest towards economics, especially towards stock. Don't underestimate him for being young; he has already been doing this for three years.\"I didn't earn much the first year, but I earned quite a bit the second year. I quadrupled my principal, so I probably earned twenty thousand dollars\" said Luo Hua.\"So much?\" Luo Feng was shocked.Twenty thousand dollars couldn't shock Luo Feng, but what shocked him was his little brother's money making efficiency! Quadrupled! This is an amazing rate!\"It's nothing much\" Luo Hua laughed, \"When you're playing with stocks, you first play psychologically and then play mathematically. As long as you control your position well and buy from the right places. It's easy to control the people behind the scenes..... It's just that at times, the stock market crashes which affects the psychological factor. Usually people get scared and quit when they don't make much money on the first year\"Luo Feng's head was blank as he listened.\"This money making of mine isn't much. The true professionals could probably earn around 10-20 times more than I can by using contracts. Of course, there's a huge risk in doing that and if something goes wrong, everything is over\" Luo Hua shaked his head as he said that.Although Luo Feng didn't understand this.....he did understand one point: stock relies on compounding interest.For example, his brother took three years to make a few thousand into twenty thousand. If he started off with a million, then he could have turned it into four million. If he had four million, it could turn into 16 million.As the money compounds on itself, it starts to get out of proportion.\"Hua, I'll give you five hundred thousand later\" Luo Feng laughed, \"Keep working\"\"Five hundred thousand?\" Luo Hua's eyes flashed, \"The stocks are plummeting at the moment, so I might be able to make a huge profit\". After living with his brother for so many years, he found out a long time ago.... that Luo Hua was always hoping for the stock market prices to drop. Their neighbor, uncle Wang, always hoped for it to raise.His brother tried to make money while uncle Wang tried to pay back money.\"The professionals always hope for the stocks to drop?\" Luo Feng thought to himself.\"Oh yea, brother, where did you get that money from?\" Asked Luo Hua.\"From that Zhou Hua Yang guy just now\" Luo Feng laughed, \"You can go use this money. After I become a fighter, there'll be tons of money to earn\". A regular fighter doesn't earn that much, but..... Luo Feng was aware of his strength. Just that telekinesis trick is already superior to a heavy machine gun!Bullets fly in one, straight line, while Luo Feng's objects can change direction at will.\"After I pass my fighter combat exam on August 1st, I'll begin my fighter career\" Luo Feng picked up a tea cup with his right hand but accidently broke it; tea poured all over the floor.Luo Hua, who was next to him, was surprised: \"Brother, what's wrong?\"\"Nothing\" Luo Feng shaked his head and laughed.However, he thought to himself: \"In jail, after training my genetic energy, my power rose by a huge margin. After my power awakened, my power increased even more! Right now, my strength and speed are far beyond what they were before. However, such rapid growth isn't such a good thing either. I can't control my power well\"Accidentally crushing the tea cup shows that he doesn't have enough control over his power.\"Hm, I'll go to the dojo of limits tomorrow morning. Starting from today until August 1st, which gives me around 20 days, I'll seriously train. I'll train and gain control over my speed and power so I can bring out my own strength more\" Luo Feng thought to himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay5 AM of the second day. While it was still dawn, Luo Feng was already rushing towards the dojo of limits.Since he still hasn't received his prospective fighter certificate, he used his old 'dojo elite member' identification to enter the dojo.\"Brother\"\"Good morning, brother\"Inside the dojo of limits, there were quite a few members already training. Luo Feng slightly smiled and nodded, and then sprinted towards the elite member's building. Since he still doesn't have his prospective fighter certificate, he can only go up to the third floor: the elite member training hall. He had no right to go to the fourth floor, which is the instructor's region.\"HA!\" A sound came from the training hall.Luo Feng looked in and saw a white robed teenager swinging around an iron spear.\"Brother Tie*\" Luo Feng called loudly, \"Coming this early in the morning to practice? How rare\"*TL note: Tie means Iron\"Crazy\" The white robed teenager stopped and looked at Luo Feng with a face of happiness, \"How come you came here? Haha, oh right, I should congratulate crazy for passing the prospective fighter exam\"\"How did you know that?\" Luo Feng was surprised.Few people should know of the fact that he passed the prospective fighter exam.\"Last night, our teacher told us when he was teaching. He told us that you and brother Yang passed the prospective fighter exam\" The white robed teenager helplessly rubbed his forehead, \"Seeing how you two passed, I certainly have no time to relax. So that's why I came here early in the morning to practice\"Luo Feng nodded.So it was the teacher who told them. Even though there were around thirty thousand members in the dojo of limits, there were only six teachers! And there was only one instructor! When the teachers teach, they usually do it in the huge training halls where thousands of members can attend at the same time.Of course, there was no need to teach the elite members, since there were only a handful of them in the entire dojo.\"Crazy, you passed the exam already. What're you here for this early in the morning?\" The white robed teenager laughed.\"August 1st, the fighter combat exam. I need to prepare myself\" Luo Feng laughed and headed towards the weapons room at the side of the training hall, which was opened.After entering the weapons room, there were a large assortment of weapons on the shelves: blades, spears, rods, bars, axes, swords, pikes, etc. Each category of weapons had even smaller divisions within. For example, the knives had one handed knives and two handed knives. And the one handed knives even had more divisions.\"The ghost series\" Luo Feng opened up a cabinet where a large amount of identical blades lay. Of course, these blades were 'copies', so they had the exact same model, weight, and center of gravity as the real blade. There was only a difference in the quality of the material. A real blade that can kill monsters is probably priced around the hundred thousands, while these copies only costed a couple hundred, so they're quite cheap.Luo Feng picked out a certain blade: a 2nd series ghost blade. The blade was 78 cm long and the entire thing was 101 cm long. It was 5.2 cm wide and the back of the blade was thick. The tip of the blade was sharp and suited for stabbing.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng swinged twice and frowned, \"I've been using this blade for so long. However..... it feels so light\"A blade that he was used to swinging was now weightless.\"I need a heavier blade to correspond with my increase in power\" Luo Feng picked another 2nd series ghost blade and swung it around \"Nope, still too light\"\"This one isn't heavy enough\"\"Light, too light\"Luo Feng picked out the heaviest 2nd series ghost blade and shook his head, \"Looks like my strength really increased too much. I can't find a blade in this elite member's weapons room that suits me\" Luo Feng could only leave the 3rd floor and go to the 4th.\"The 4th floor is where the teachers and instructors frequently go to\" Luo Feng knew that there was also a training hall and weapons room in there, \"Prospective fighters also have the right to enter, but I still don't have my prospective fighter certificate. Not sure if I'm allowed to be here\"At the side of the staircase, there was a veteran on duty in a small room.\"Hm? What are you doing. This place is not for students\" The old on duty veteran stood up and suddenly let out a face of surprise and laughed, \"Oh, it's Luo Feng. I heard from instructor Jiang that you passed the prospective fighter exam. Haha, come on in\"\"Thank you, uncle Li\" Luo Feng let out a sigh of relief.If this uncle Li was strict and forced Luo Feng to show his prospective fighter certificate, then Luo Feng wouldn't have been able to go in. From the law's point of view, Luo Feng is still not a prospective fighter.There were tons of decorations in the 4th floor's training hall, along with much higher quality machines and devices.At this time, there was only Luo Feng in the training hall.\"What a waste, truly a waste\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to shake his head as he sighed, \"In this dojo, there are only six teachers. Other than when they teach, they usually train at the limit hall. There's such a good place here, but it's almost always empty\"Luo Feng shook his head as he entered the weapons room to the side.The weapons here were also copies, but they were clearly much better than the ones on the 3rd floor.\"2nd series ghost blade. Yup, these blades are much heavier\" Luo Feng picked one and swung it around and then picked another one. After five tries, he finally found a suitable one. He looked at the label and saw that it had a weight of--101kg\ufffd\ufffd\"What, 101 kg?\" Even Luo Feng was startled, \"Such a heavy blade feels so easy to control to me?\"The ghost blades were a type of blades that rely on speed, so they were usually lighter.To need a weight of 101 kg, how much has his strength actually increased?\"Looks like my body fitness really did raise by a startling amount. I'll go check my fist strength and speed later\" Luo Feng was a bit excited, \"Now, I'll practice the basics\". After selecting a suitable blade, he picked a hexagonal shield.......In the training hall, Luo Feng's left arm wielded the shield while his right hand wielded the ghost blade.[HE!][HA!]Luo Feng was practicing the most basics of blade wielding--horizontal cuts, upwards cuts, swinging, rapid cuts..... Each of them were extremely precise. Everytime Luo Feng swung his blade, his center of gravity wasn't affected at all. He kept practicing like this and improved himself.\"My power is too great now so I can't control my swinging power too well\" Luo Feng knew his own problems.\"My strength is great, but I have to be able to use it\" Luo Feng was clear.Even if your fitness level is greater than your opponent's, that doesn't mean your skill is.Some people can only express 30% of their strength.Some people can express 505, 60%, 70%, and even 100%. Some of the grandmaster class bladesman can use a small amount of power to kill a being that's ten times stronger than him. This is the importance of skill and experience.Of course--If there's too much of a difference in body fitness level, then even skill cannot make up for that. Simply put, no matter what, you have to train in order to bring out your body's full power.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"Instructor\" The on duty uncle Li greeted loudly on the 4th floor.\"Who's inside?\" asked instructor Jiang Nian. He heard a bunch of faint sounds from the training hall, which were the sounds of a blade causing shockwaves in the air due to its incredible speed. Just the sound alone is enough to know that the person wielding it is a fighter.\"It's Luo Feng\" uncle Li laughed.\"Luo Feng?\" instructor Jiang Nian laughed and walked towards the training hall.As he stood at the entrance to the training hall, he watched Luo Feng's movements, which were by the book, basic movements. Sometimes he would cut ahead, suddenly dash forwards, dodge, backstep, etc. The movements were all very smooth and connected.\"Hm, what a solid foundation\" instructor Jiang Nian couldn't help but to nod and praise in his heart, \"Only by mastering the basics can you get better. There are no clear weak points, great\"The more he watched the more pleased he became.\"Ah, instructor\" Luo Feng turned and realized instructor Jiang Nian was there and stopped.Instructor Jiang Nian laughed and walked in: \"Luo Feng, nice skill. You've been training since you were young?\"\"Yes, before I enrolled in the dojo, I practiced alone at home\" Luo Feng laughed. Instructor Jiang Nian nodded his head in satisfaction, but his expression suddenly froze as he saw the ghost blade Luo Feng was holding; his eyes widened and became huge.\"Instructor, instructor?\" Luo Feng was startled by the instructor's expression.\"You, you.....\" instructor Jiang Nian looked at Luo Feng with surprise, \"You were just swinging a 101 kg ghost blade?\"\"Ye, yes\" Luo Feng was frozen.Instructor Jiang Nian shaked his head: \"Impossible, impossible..... there's no way\" but soon after, instructor Jiang Nian's eyes flashed and he stared at Luo Feng as if he was a jewel, \"Luo Feng, hurry and go to that fist strength tester machine over there and show me the results! I want to see exactly how strong you are now\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In just these few days he was able to grow to the point where he can easily wield the 101 kg ghost blade? Doesn't that mean his strength just jump up by a couple times?\" instructor Jiang Nian took in a deep breath.Ever since he became the dojo instructor, Jiang Nian's 'Dojo Contribution' was lowering.All the fighters in the dojo of limits highly value dojo contribution.The fastest way to raise contribution is to kill monsters. However, Jiang Nian hasn't hunted for a long time.\"If I'm right, then Luo Feng must've grasped the techniques to genetic energy training faster than most fighters\" thought Jiang Nian, \"Maybe I'll have the chance to get headquarters to send a few people here. If I can recommend Luo Feng, then not only will I be able to get more dojo contribution, but I'll also have a face to show in front of the other instructors!\"Jiang Nian couldn't help but to be excited.\"Luo Feng, give me your strongest punch!\" ordered Jiang Nian.\"Yes, instructor\"Luo Feng stood in front of the fist strength tester machine and took in a deep breath as he thought, \"My physical prowess is nothing compared to my spiritual force though\". Luo Feng didn't plan on hiding any strength back, so he adjusted his breathing and pushed forward like a dragon.[HONG\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd]The fist landed like a missile on the machine, which shook violently in response.\ufffd\ufffd[DI!]\"How much?\" Jiang Nian immediately ran over and looked at the machine's display. Luo Feng also looked at the display, since he had no idea how strong he was right now.The machine displayed a clear number--'3109kg'\ufffd\ufffd\"3109 kg?\" Jiang Nian took in a deep breath and turned to Luo Feng like he was a monster.Luo Feng was also surprised at this number; his strength increased by so much: \"I was around 1100 kg during the prospective fighter exam. My strength increased the fastest when I did my genetic energy training, so it probably raised to around 1500 to 1800 kg. After I awakened, my body became even stronger and jumped all the way to 3109 kg?\"Ever since he awakened, Luo Feng could feel the change in his body, but he never had a clear number to express it.\"Luo Feng, you, you succeeded in your genetic energy training?\" asked Jiang Nian.\"Yes. After the prospective fighter exam, my first attempt at genetic energy training was a success\" nodded Luo Feng.Jiang Nian couldn't help but to clap and shout: \"Haha, I finally have a truly genius person come out from my Zhi-An region's dojo. Just with his first time at genetic energy training, his strength went from 1100 kg to 3100 kg. For his strength to go up that much, there's probably at most one or two geniuses like this in the entire Jiang-Nan city!\"When you start genetic energy training for the first time, it's a completely new experience to your body.Since your body has never absorbed anything like it before, it has 'hungered' for dozens of years. So the first time you do it, the results are the most startling!Starting from the 2nd time and on, the changes are small. You need years and years of training to improve yourself. This first time of training..... also shows someone's fitness level. Some people's strength raise by 300 kg, which is normal. Above average would be around 600 kg.Some even raise by 1000 kg..... which was already considered elite.And Luo Feng rose by 2000 kg!!! This is true genius!\"Luo Feng, come and test your speed. Afterwards, test your reaction speed\" Jiang Nian, as if he just found a gem, couldn't wait to test its powers.\"Yes, instructor\" Luo Feng was also a bit excited.The results soon came out.--Strength--3109kg\ufffd\ufffdSpeed--58m/s\ufffd\ufffdReaction speed--Beginner warrior full points\ufffd\ufffdIntermediate warrior excellent\ufffd\ufffd\"Haha, a monster came out of my Zhi-An region too\" Jiang Nian looked at the final grade on the reaction speed test and turned red with excitement and patted Luo Feng's shoulder \"Luo Feng, your instructor's dojo contribution will be relying on you\"Luo Feng only chuckled a bit.\"Luo Feng, with the improvement in your strength, I can let you join the dojo early\" Jiang Nian said, \"You don't need to go through the fighter combat exam, you can join right now!\"\"Join the dojo of limits?\" Luo Feng was suspicious.Usually, you only get a right to join a power after becoming a fighter.\"Luo Feng, since you came out of my Zhi-An region's dojo of limits, I am technically the person who lead your way\" instructor Jiang Nian patted Luo Feng on the shoulder and laughed, \"I won't hide it from you. With your first time doing genetic energy training, your strength rose over 2000 kg. And your speed and reaction speed also improved by a huge amount. It's easy to tell--your talent is genius level\ufffd\ufffdor should I say monster level. In the entire 200 million population of Jiang-Nan city, there's probably only one or two people who are this talented\"Luo Feng couldn't help but to laugh inside.....Monster level?Only Luo Feng knew that his fist strength rose by only around 600 kg after his first time doing genetic energy training. Only after he awakened was his strength able to raise to this startling amount.However--Jiang Nian couldn't have thought of that, since genetic energy training is the cause of a normal fighter's highest raise in strength!\"Geniuses like you will naturally be scouted by the Thunder Dojo, underground gangs, and other families after you finish your fighter combat exam\" Jiang Nian laughed, \"At that time, you might find their generous conditions to be alluring\"Luo Feng realized, yes, if only one or two monsters like this appear in the entire population of 200 million in Jiang-Nan city, then who wouldn't try to fight over them?\"So if I let you join now, isn't that even better?\" instructor Jiang Nian laughed, \"Of course, no need to worry. Our conditions aren't bad at all! A normal fighter usually gets a private villa and a hundred thousand chinese dollars. Luo Feng, you need to watch your money. The armor, weapons, guide books, and some other special weapons, along with lessons from powerful fighters, all need money\"Luo Feng nodded.\"For a genius like you, we'll give you a private villa along with 20 million dollars! To let you buy the armor and weapons and everything you need. At the same time, we the dojo of limits will also give you a free Dao Yin technique, a hidden blade scroll, and a hidden agility scroll. As long as the price of these three are lower than 50 million, we'll give it to you for free. If it's over 50 million, then you'll have to pay the extra\"Luo Feng couldn't help but to take a deep breath.Holy!Normal fighters only get a million, while he is getting almost 70 million! Since the Dao Yin techniques, and blade and agility guides were important to fighters.\"Luo Feng, those three things shouldn't be over 50 million. However, if you buy them from a different place, you might end up paying two times more\" Jiang Nian smiled, \"The fighters of the dojo of limits have a discount when buying certain scrolls. Of course, to buy a certain level of scrolls also require a corresponding level of dojo contribution! If you don't have the contribution, you can't get the scrolls even if you have money. Of course, your free gifts won't ask for any dojo contribution\"Luo Feng realized that the conditions given to him were extremely extravagant.\"My dojo of limits' conditions towards geniuses are all the same\" Jiang Nian smiled, \"In the dojo of limits, you can earn other comrades' help from all over. And our leader, the strongest fighter Hong, will also sometimes lead a bunch of true elites.Luo Feng has lived in this age for quite a while, so he was clear on the influence of the dojo of limits!Joining the dojo of limits was definitely a good choice.\"Okay, instructor. I accept\" Luo Feng nodded.\"Haha\" Jiang Nian laughed, \"Of course, I don't have the right to let you join the dojo of limits immediately..... Accepting fighters of your talent needs headquarters themselves to test you\" As he said that, Jiang Nian took out a cell phone from his pocket and quietly said 'Headquarters', which made the cell phone dial them.Shortly after--A person appeared on the cell phone's screen.\"Jiang Nian, what's up?\" The screen's old, bald veteran laughed.\"Uncle Bai\" Jiang Nian said excitedly, \"I found a genius fighter in my Zhi-An region. His fist strength increased by 2000 kg after his first time doing genetic energy training. His speed is 58 m/s and his reaction speed test was excellent in an intermediate warrior exam! Surely he's a monster level genius\"\"Oh?\" The old, bald veteran was surprised and asked, \"His first time and it improved his strength by 2000 kg? How old is he?\"The older you are, the less worth you are to nurture.\"18 years old!\" Jiang Nian answered.\"What, only 18 years old?\" The old, bald veteran suddenly stood up and shouted, \"Hurry up and bring him to headquarters here you kid! I'll immediately organize a test for this kid\"\"Okay, I'll go to headquarters immediately\"Jiang Nian hung up and turned to Luo Feng smiling, \"Luo Feng, come with me now to headquarters\"\"Yes, instructor. Instructor, I'll put the ghost blade and hexagonal shield back into the weapons room\" right when Luo Feng spoke, Jiang Nian was tugging at Luo Feng: \"Who cares about the room, just leave it on the floor. Hurry, don't waste time\"As he said that, Jiang Nian pulled Luo Feng and rushed towards the staircase, at the same time, Jiang Nian ordered: \"Old Li, I probably won't have any time today, so cancel tonight's lessons\"\"Yes, instructor\" Uncle Li nodded, and right when he said that.Jiang Nian and Luo Feng were no longer in his field of vision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang-Nan city was made up of the main section and eight surrounding sections.The means of transportation between the sections is a train. When a regular person wants to ride the train, they have to buy a ticket three days prior. A ticket is also extremely expensive. And to go from one city to another..... would be unthinkable for most people due to the price. Most of the 200 million residents will never leave Jiang-Nan city.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdJiang-Nan city, main section.Jiang Nian and Luo Feng walked side by side on the sidewalk.\"Luo Feng, notice any difference between the main section and our Yang-Zhou?\" Jiang Nian smiled as he pointed around. Luo Feng looked around and shaked his head, \"Not really, it's just that there are more people, more cars, and that there's a larger sidewalk. Everything else is normal\". Indeed, there was nothing special about their current location.Jiang Nian smiled: \"Right now, there's not much of a difference. But soon you will see it\"\"Hello?\" Jiang Nian answered his cell phone.\"Jiang Nian, how much longer until you get here?\" The old veteran appeared on the cell phone's display.\"We'll be there within 10 minutes\" Jiang Nian smiled.\"Okay, I already got all of the main authorities here, so don't mess up later\" reminded the old, bald veteran.\"The main authorities?\" Jiang Nian was surprised.As they were talking. Luo Feng noticed a large area in front of him. There was a white, silver wall stretching across and a huge, tall, dark blue skyscraper. This skyscraper had four gigantic letters that could be seen miles away--Dojo of Limits*\ufffd\ufffd*TL note: chinese: \ufffdO\ufffd\u0795\ufffd\ufffd^\"This is the main headquarters of the dojo of limits! Our headquarters in Jiang-Nan city\" said Jiang Nian.\"There sure are a lot of soldiers\" Luo Feng took in a deep breath.Outside the walls of the dojo of limits headquarters, there were tons of soldiers wielding real guns. The feeling that the headquarters gave you was like a fully armed beast. And at the main gate, there were rows of soldiers that spanned across a hundred meters.\"This is our dojo of limits' army\" Jiang Nian smiled, \"Security is high inside the building too\".\"Go, enter\" Jiang Nian brought Luo Feng towards the main gate.\"Let them in!\" A one-armed man with scars on his face waved his hand, and all the soldiers backed up a step. The entire process made Luo Feng hold his breath.The one-armed man smiled as he looked at Jiang Nian: \"Old Jiang, it's been a while since you've been here. We should drink a bit together later\"\"Okay\" Jiang Nian smiled and nodded. He then glanced at Luo Feng, \"Luo Feng, he is your senior, greet uncle Lu\"\"Uncle Lu\" Luo Feng loudly greeted. He could feel that this one-armed man is a powerful fighter.\"Not bad, kiddo\" the one-armed man nodded as he smiled.\"We're in a hurry, so we'll talk later. Uncle Bai is waiting for us in there\" Jiang Nian immediately brought Luo Feng into the courtyard of the headquarters, which looked like a gigantic park. There were flowing rivers, fake mountains, and flowerbeds everywhere. And Luo Feng could sense that every person he walked past was special.Jiang Nian sighed as he walked with Luo Feng: \"That uncle Lu just now is one of my good friends who would fight with his life on the line with me back in the days. He is a good friend who has went through many hardships. His arm was broken off by a black, steel gorilla in one hit\"Luo Feng listened silently.\"The fighters in our dojo of limits are very united\" Jiang Nian pointed towards the skyscraper, \"Look, that building is the headquarters for the fighters of the dojo of limits in Jiang-Nan city! Virtually every person that walks out of that building is a fighter\"\"Virtually every single one?\" Luo Feng gasped.Looking through the glass of the building, there were almost a hundred people inside.\"There is a good 200 million population in Jiang-Nan city, how could we be short on fighters?\" Jiang Nian laughed, \"In this building, the 1st floor is the lobby is for chatting and eating. The 2nd to 9th floors are used for warrior level training. The 10th to 19th floors are for the general level fighters. And for 20 and above..... is where conferences are held.Luo Feng, a bit confused, asked: \"Instructor, fighters are split into warrior and general levels?\"\"Fighters are mainly split into the warrior level, the general level, and the extremely rare battle lord level!\" Jiang Nian explained quietly, \"Most people are in the warrior level! Many fighters stay in the warrior level forever. And the warrior level is split into beginner warrior, intermediate warrior, and elite warrior. Most of the fighters who just passed their exams belong to the beginner warrior level!\"\"Luo Feng, with your current strength, you're probably an intermediate warrior\" Jiang Nian said.Luo Feng nodded.Looks like with his strength, he's still at the bottom level of the fighters.\"You can probably kill warrior level fighters with heated weapons\"\"But you can't kill most general level fighters with heated weapons\" Jiang Nian said, \"For example, if you fire a heavy machine gun at a general level fighter, he can easily dodge using just his speed and reaction speed! The general level fighters are considered as the elites\"\"Even though you have good talent, you're still young, so you're just a rookie\" Jiang Nian laughed.Luo Feng could only rub his forehead.Luo Feng knew a lot about the powerful fighters. For example, the fighter who cut the black-crowned golden eagle in half on television..... Even with his spiritual force, he probably couldn't even touch a hair.\"Those above the general level are the battle lords!\" Jiang Nian spoke in admiration, \"Those are the truly powerful warriors! Each one can easily walk in a storm of bullets. Their speed is as fast as lightning and their reaction speed is even more incredible. A punch or kick from them can destroy an entire apartment. Battle lord! This is a battle lord\"Luo Feng listened with his breath holded.Warrior..... General..... Battle lord!With his current level, he's only an intermediate warrior! Maybe after using his spiritual force, his strength will increase and he might have a chance of getting into the general level.\"Instructor, are there any higher levels than the battle lord?\" asked Luo Feng.\"Yes\"Jiang Nian smiled and nodded, \"There are existences above the battle lord level. Each one of them has a sky shattering, earth shaking power! When faced with such fighters, even countries have to respect them. However, there are barely any people like this. Even our entire country of China has two or three people like this.Luo Feng was stunned.Even China, one of the five countries, only had two or three people above the battle lord level?\"So the fighters are usually split into the warrior, general, and battle lord categories!\" explained Jiang Nian, \"Of course, the world uses your fist strength, speed, and reaction speed to gauge your strength. They also use your battle records!\"\"Battle records?\" Luo Feng was confused.\"Yes. Luo Feng, with your current fitness level, you should be at the intermediate warrior level! However, after you become a fighter, you're technically a beginner warrior! Only after you kill enough monsters and powerful monsters will you be able to qualify as an intermediate warrior\" Jiang Nian sighed, \"Since some people have better technique while others have better fitness levels. Others have all sorts of tricks up their sleeves. So to gauge their strength, the only standard is the battle record!\"Luo Feng nodded.Yes..... even if their body fitness levels are worlds apart, a person with a lower fitness level can still kill a person with a higher one!\"Keep working and get to the general level! Then you'll be the pride of our Yang-Zhou city\" Jiang Nian laughed, \"Brother Yan Luo who came to find me last time is a general level fighter\"\"Oh\" Luo Feng slightly nodded.If he used his spiritual force, how strong would he be? Would he be able to compare to a general level fighter? Only time will tell......As Luo Feng and Jiang Nian talked, they quickly arrived at a three story villa. This villa took up a huge amount of space. A bald, old veteran yelled from the balcony of the second floor: \"Jiang Nian, hurry up and come up\"\"Come, go up with me\"Jiang Nian brought Luo Feng and quickly entered the villa.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were five people standing beside the bald, old veteran. Four of them wore white suits. The four of them stood behind a black Tang suit wearing middle-aged man. This man was skinny, had a hooked nose, and his eyes were filled with warmth and happiness; he gave off a vibe of kindness.Jiang Nian immediately glared at Luo Feng, which caused Luo Feng to realize: \"Hello, chief\".\"Yep\"The middle-aged man slightly nodded and spoke, \"Old bai, you guys can start. Assess this young man's strength\"\"Certainly\" uncle Bai also responded respectfully.Luo Feng muttered to himself: \"Instructor Jiang Nian didn't greet chief instructor 'Wu Tong' like this. This uncle Bai, who has a high position at the dojo of limits headquarters, also treats this chief respectfully..... Just who is this chief?\"Nevertheless, it is clear that the chief is a man of high authority.[DI!]All the switches on the fist strength tester machine and the speed tester machine were turned on.[WU~~]All the security cameras on the second floor's training hall were turned on to record Luo Feng's performance. The four men and women in white suits immediately started moving, whether it was using their laptops or personally checking if the machines were in good condition.\"Uncle Bai, no problems\" said a young woman.\"Okay\" Uncle Bai looked towards Luo Feng, \"Luo Feng, begin testing. First start with strength\"Luo Feng took in a deep breath and headed towards the fist strength tester. Whether it was Jiang Nian, uncle Bai, the four white suits wearing men and women, or the high chief, all of their gazes landed upon Luo Feng. Luo Feng, who seemed relaxed, suddenly exploded like a panther.[PENG!] The explosive fist landed on the machine.Luo Feng immediately looked at the display--'3110kg'\ufffd\ufffd\"Not bad, kiddo\" The silent chief smiled and nodded, \"Next category\"The results for speed and reaction speed soon came out.Speed--58m/s\ufffd\ufffdReaction speed--beginner warrior, perfect score. Intermediate warrior, excellent\ufffd\ufffd[Phew]Luo Feng walked out of the red circle of the reaction speed tester and let out a breath after seeing his scores were normal, \"Not bad, good thing I didn't mess up at the most important time\". Jiang Nian, who was next to Luo Feng, also relaxed. Since some people can't show their true skill when affected by too much pressure.\"Out of the three, reaction speed is the best\" The Tang suit wearing middle-aged man smiled and nodded.\"He's also 18 years old, which is in the restricted range\"The Tang suit wearing middle-aged man looked at Jiang Nian and smiled, \"A genius has came out of your Zhi-An section. Good work, Jiang Nian\"Jiang Nian couldn't help but to show a face of happiness: \"As long as Luo Feng works hard enough\"\"Yup\"The Tang suit wearing middle-aged man's gaze landed on Luo Feng, \"Luo Feng, are you willing to join my dojo of limits? I'm sure Jiang Nian has already told you all of the conditions\"\"I am willing to join\" Luo Feng had no hesitation.\"Very good\"The Tang suit wearing middle-aged man clapped his hands, \"According to the rules, you can pick a villa either here in the main sector or in Yang-Zhou city. You have the right to live there but not to sell it. All of the villas in our dojo of limits area are all inhabited by fighters\"\"Other than that, you get 20 million dollars! You also get the Dao Yin technique, the blade scroll, and the agility scroll as long as they are below 50 million\" The Tang suit wearing middle-aged man laughed, \"Am I right?\"\"Yes\" Luo Feng nodded.The Tang suit wearing middle-aged man looked towards a white suit wearing woman: \"Go get the contract, but change one of the points. Luo Feng can pick any Dao Yin technique, agility scroll, and offensive scroll. As long as they are within another 50 million, they're all free. I'll pay for it\"\"Yes, chief\" The white suit wearing woman looked at Luo Feng in shock and went to get the contract.\"Chief.....\" Luo Feng was shocked.Before, the three scrolls had to be below 50 million. Now the cap is raised by another 50 million, and the chief is paying for it.\"Luo Feng, you're not bad\" the Tang suit wearing middle-aged man smiled, \"I like you, don't mind this small change\"\"Small change?\" Luo Feng was surprised.From 50 million to 100 million, in other words, this chief has to pay millions. And that is small change? Even a general level fighter probably doesn't have this much to spare.\"Thank you, chief\" thanked Luo Feng.The Tang suit wearing middle-aged man smiled. The contract was brought over and quickly signed by the Tang suit wearing middle-aged man. The white suit wearing woman carried the contract and pen over to Luo Feng, \"Sign here, here, and here\"Luo Feng scanned the contract. The contract was crystal clear; all of the points were straightforward. There was none of that headache causing business jargon. Luo Feng signed.\"Welcome, Luo Feng, to our dojo of limits family!\" the Tang suit wearing middle-aged man smiled and extended his hand.Luo Feng did the same, and they shook hands.\"From today on, you can move in to the fighter's villa area\" the Tang suit wearing middle-aged man smiled, \"As for your money and scrolls, you'll receive them when you officially become a fighter. Your money will be transferred to your fighter account\"Luo Feng nodded.\"Oh, right, my name is Zhu Ge Tao. Don't forget that, kiddo\" the Tang suit wearing middle-aged man smiled, and soon left the building with the four white suit wearing men and women.The second floor of the villa was empty; only uncle Bai, Jiang Nian, and Luo Feng were left.\"Phew, my breathing was a bit tense with the chief's presence\" Jiang Nian laughed loudly.\"I also had no idea that the chief would come\" said uncle Bai.Luo Feng asked with uncertainty, \"Instructor, uncle Bai, just who is this chief?\"\"Haha, kiddo, you're in luck. The chief saw your instructor and raised your cap by another 50 million\" uncle Bai looked at Luo Feng, \"But the thing that surprises me the most is that the chief told you his name! Looks like he really does like you\"\"Name?\" Luo Feng didn't realize what it meant for the chief to give someone his name.Luo Feng had no initial reaction after hearing the name Zhu Ge Tao. He just sighed to himself...... the name 'Zhu Ge' is quite rare.\"Luo Feng, using our words, that instructor is one of the Big Four of our Jiang-Nan dojo of limits\" Jiang Nian smiled.\"Big Four?\" Luo Feng was startled.Uncle Bai glared at Jiang Nian and said in a quiet voice: \"This is all private. In the Jiang-Nan dojo of limits headquarters, the chairman has the highest authority, followed by the three chiefs! The chairman and the three chiefs make up what most fighters privately call, the Big Four! Each one of them holds an immense amount of authority and power. If you want to become a chief, you have to at least be a 'Elite General' level fighter. At the same time, your dojo contribution must be high and you also need a lot of support from other general level fighters!\"\"Oh?\" Luo Feng was surprised.There are three large factors in becoming a chief? Strength, contribution, and support?\"Luo Feng, to a chief, 50 million really isn't that much\" said Jiang Nian in a quiet voice, \"From my point of view, the reason why the chief values you so much..... is because you're still so young. Only 18 years old! He has decided that you have hope in the future and you have the potential to become a general level fighter. So today, he invested 50 million to help you a bit\"Luo Feng nodded.Uncle Bai laughed on the side: \"However, Luo Feng, don't get cocky. You do have good talent, but becoming a general level fighter is extremely difficult! The chief only thought that you have a sliver of hope; just a possibility\"\"And because of that small possibility, he gave me 50 million?\" Luo Feng gasped.The dojo's rules were strict. The rules were that the three scrolls couldn't exceed 50 million. Even the chief couldn't do anything to change that. He can only take out money from his own pocket to build upon the original foundation of 50 million. When fighters are growing, the type of scroll used has a huge impact on them\"\"Well, leave that thought aside for now, Luo Feng. The fact that the chief is giving you special treatment can only mean good things. The chiefs have broad connections, whether it's the army, the circle of powerful fighters, the government, and all sorts of powerful families..... each chief has their own set of connections. The chief is one of the most powerful figures in Jiang-Nan city\" Jiang Nian couldn't help but to say.Luo Feng nodded.The fact that the chief is giving him special treatment is a good thing, what's the point of thinking about all of this. Since the chief is helping him, he just needs a chance in the future to return the favor.\"Luo Feng, when are you going to move into Yang-Zhou city's fighter area? Or will you move into main sector?\" asked Jiang Nian.Luo Feng slightly hesitated.....His parents' friends were virtually all in Yang-Zhou city. His own good friends were in Yang-Zhou city too.\"I'll move into the Ming-Yue sector\" answered Luo Feng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was only until night that Luo Feng could return to his home in Yang-Zhou city.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdAt night, the streetlights in the southern shore region were lit up.There were three middle-aged men who were drenched in sweat, laughing and talking as they walked down the road. You could smell the smell of wood and paint if you go near them.\"My waist is becoming unbearably painful. I guess I have to sleep face down tonight\" said a burly man has he held his waist and said in pain, \"My prostrate also hurts. I guess it's time to get a checkup at a hospital. Damn, that costs a lot of money though\"\"Old Tian, why don't you tell our boss and take a rest for two days? You can start working again when you feel better\" said Luo Feng's father, Luo Hong Guo.\"Yea, Old Tian, it's not worth ruining your body\" said the slightly fat brute on the side.\"Okay. I'll be heading home first\" said the burly middle-aged man. He turned and headed towards a cone shaped apartment. The slightly fat brute and Luo Hong Guo sighed and said good bye as they headed towards another cone shaped apartment.Luo Hong Guo slowly walked towards his home under the dim light of the streetlights.\"32nd floor!\" Luo Hong Guo stood on the first floor and looked at the stairs. As of now, climbing up 32 floors is easy for most people. However, for Luo Hong Guo, who has been doing manual labor for an entire day, even walking is tiring, \"My neck and waist are a bit sore. I should find some time to rest\"Luo Hong Guo climbed the stairs all the way up to the 32nd floor![DING DONG] [DING DONG] Luo Hong Guo stood outside the door and pressed the doorbell. He was too lazy to take the keys out of his pocket.[KA!]When the door was opened, he saw a huge, extravagant meal on the table; there were a dozen different dishes. Their family doesn't even have this much on New Years.\"What's going on, all of this food\" even though Luo Hong Guo wasn't too happy, he still walked in the house with a smiling face.[DAN DAN DAN DAN~~~] Luo Hua yelled while sitting on his wheelchair, \"Dad, welcome home!\"\"Dad!\" Luo Feng obediently brought some tea to his father and said, \"From now on, dad won't have to wear this uniform anymore!\"\"Hm?\" Luo Hong Guo was shocked.\"Luo\" Gong Xin Lan, who was carrying the rice bowls, smiled at Luo Hong Guo, \"Our son just signed a contract with the dojo of limits. Once he passes the fighter combat exam, he'll receive two billion dollars. He even received a private villa; he brought the keys to it home\"\"What?\" Luo Hong Guo was startled, \"Xin Lan, what did you just say?\"\"Dad, look\" Luo Feng gave Luo Hong Guo the signed contract.Luo Hong Guo took it and looked carefully, from the very first word to the very last word, Luo Hong Guo didn't dare miss anything...... He looked at this contract as if he was looking at a wedding certificate. All the terms on the contract were very clear.\"This, this..... Don't you sign the contract with the dojo of limits after the fighter combat exam?\" Luo Hong Guo was in a state of disbelief, \"And how come there's two billion dollars?\"Before, when Luo Feng passed the prospective fighter exam, Luo Hong Guo carefully checked.....When a fighter joins the dojo, they only get a hundred million.\"Dad, this is because brother's a genius\" Luo Hua said as he made a strange laugh, \"What's the most important thing in this age? The geniuses within the fighters\"\"All of us are able to live in this villa?\" Luo Hong Guo looked towards his son Luo Feng.Gong Xin Lan laughed on the side: \"If you want to live there, you can go right now!\"\"Ha, haha.....\" Luo Hong Guo couldn't even control himself anymore; tears were welling up in his eyes. Even after all of these years, there was no chance of him changing with his current job, even if he worked for the rest of his life. He has worked so hard for his family. And now there's finally a chance to change! He can immediately live in the legendary private villa!Indeed, a private villa is a legendary existence for a regular person. After the Grand Nirvana period, a city has to hold 200 million people, so land is extremely valuable! Since villas take up so much space, you can't even get them with money!Even the few very rich people who inhabit the villas have to pay an enormous tax.\"Even I, Luo Hong Guo, has an opportunity to live in a villa!!!\" Luo Hong Guo couldn't control his happiness, \"Haha, even my dog of a boss' home isn't going to be as good as mine\"\"Yup yup\" Luo Hua was starting to get excited too, \"Our home will have huge windows and a huge bath! It'll also have a very huge living room! Our television and laptops will all be equipped with voice recognition systems. Our living room's television's display will be at least 200 inches wide. We can even roll around on our beds!\"\"A bed to roll around on, I've been wishing for one for ages\" Luo Hua said excitedly.When Luo Feng saw his dad and brother like this, he was truly happy inside.Why did he work so hard?Wasn't it all just for this day?\"Dad, mom, sit down, let's eat\" Luo Feng laughed.\"I'm going to take a shower\" Luo Hong Guo laughed loudly, \"In the future, I won't have to wear this uniform already. I'll contact my boss about this\"\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdTonight, Luo Feng's family was filled with a never before seen happiness.This home, which was only 36 ping, has housed this family of four for so many years. Even though they weren't satisfied with this home, for example, the parents have to sleep on the couch and rarely any sunlight gets in. The bathroom is pitifully small..... there are just too many flaws.However..... right when they were about to leave, Luo Feng's family was a bit hesitant, since there were way too many memories in this home.However, people have to go higher!The morning of the second day, a large truck was parked in front of the apartment. Luo Feng and his family started to move their things onto the truck.\"Old Luo, what's happening? How come you're moving?\"\"Eh, sister Lan, what're you doin' so early in the mornin'?\".....Many familiar friends and neighbors in this small sector curiously asked Luo Hong Guo and Gong Xin Lan.\"Haha, my son Feng joined the dojo of limits, so we're moving to the Ming-Yue sector!\" Luo Hong Guo answered with pride, \"Wang San, you better come to the feast I host in my home.\"Out of all the people who have lived in this poor apartment, who isn't hoping to make a change for themselves one day?Luo Hong Guo changed! And he relied on his son!\"Old Luo's son sure is great, he actually joined the dojo of limits\"\"Yea, he's great. I wonder when my son can become that great too. Now old Luo got lucky and made a change for himself\"The rumors spread from each person to ten others, from ten others to a hundred others.Momentarily, the news spread across the entire southern shore region and even to other apartments in other regions. They all knew that Luo Hong Guo's son has joined the dojo of limits and their family will be moving to the Ming-Yue sector! This is an unbelievably huge, joyous event, which also made many other teenagers hope to help their families\"\"Wen, when you want to find me, go straight to the Ming-Yue sector. However, give me a call before you come so I can contact the guards\" said Luo Feng to his good friend Wei Wen.\"Okay\" Wei Wen excitedly hit Luo Feng's chest, \"I knew that you could do this Luo Feng. Who cares about high school exams. Can one in ten thousand college graduates or military academy graduates live in a private villa? Jeez, I'll be sure to come look at your home in a few days. I haven't even stepped into a villa before\"Very quickly--Under the gazes of the numerous men, women, and children, Luo Feng and his family rode a car, which was followed by a truck filled with things they couldn't bear to throw away.Luo Feng and his family left the southern shore region and entered the fighter's Ming-Yue sector.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdNoon, at the entrance in front of the Ming-Yue sector. Six soldiers holding real guns were guarding the gate at both sides, scanning the surroundings.\"Stop!\" One of the guards immediately raised his assault rifle and pointed it at the incoming car.[CHI!] That car made an emergency brake.Luo Feng and his family came out of the car, and a bald, old man came out of the guardsman's lounge. He laughed: \"Luo Feng, right? Last time I saw you for your prospective fighter exam, I knew your future was limitless. However, I didn't think you'd be coming to live in our sector so quickly. I was contacted yesterday. Hurry, come and help them move their things\"\"Luo Feng, we have people to help you move your things. These moving companies aren't allowed to enter here\" laughed the bald, old man.\"We understand\" father Luo Hong Guo laughed and nodded.At once, seven soldiers rushed out of the sector and speedily helped move the things. The men from the moving company watched with awe. After that, Luo Feng and his family moved into the Ming-Yue sector.Luo Feng looked at the Limit Hall in the center and then looked at his surroundings. There were small bridges, flowing rivers, fake mountains and ponds, and a villa that was encircled by flowing water, \"From now on, this will be my home\". Luo Feng turned his head to his parents and his brother on his wheelchair. At this time, his parents and his brother all looked with excitement towards the small sector.\"Mr. Luo Feng, this in front of you shall be your home\" A few soldiers were moving things and a young woman smiled as she held a few papers, \"#199 will be Mr. Luo Feng's home. This villa has three floors and a basement. The third floor also has a large terrace. The total area is 512 ping. If you count the basement, garden, and terrace, then it nears 800 ping\"Luo Feng and his family exchanged glances.....And then they closely looked at this luxurious villa with red and white walls; this will be their home!\"36 ping? Near 800 ping?\" Luo Hua on his wheelchair couldn't help but to mutter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLate at night on July 31st, in Ming-Yue sector's #199 villa. On the second floor in this villa, there were four huge rooms: A bedroom, a media room, a guest room, and a gigantic training hall. This training hall was at least 120 ping and took up half of the 2nd floor.Late into the night, the street light shined through the glass of the media room and refracted into the training hall.Luo Feng, wearing a loose dojo uniform, silently kneeled on the floor. Two streams of light constantly and rapidly circled around Luo Feng's body. As if they were happy, joyous birds, they flew around the dojo quickly and flexibly.After a while, the two streams of light slowed down and floated next to Luo Feng; they were two throwing knives.\"With my current level of spiritual force, controlling things isn't too hard. However, if I control like four of five knives..... the speed, power, etc. diminish\" Other than trying to control his new strength, Luo Feng has put most of this month's work on his spiritual force training.While Luo Feng was living in the Ming-Yue sector this month, he met and talked with many fighters. Luo Feng also confirmed one thing--that his telekinesis is indeed spiritual force!\"I'm taking the fighter combat exam tomorrow, so I should rest well tonight\"Luo Feng stood up and opened the glass door, and then headed to his bedroom to sleep.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdAugust 1st, noon. Under the leadership of a fighter, thirty or so prospective fighters, including Luo Feng and Yang Wu, rushed towards the train station.[KU-CHI~~ KU-CHI~~] The train was moving quickly into the station and the sounds of the wheels grinding against the tracks were weak. The carriages of the train were all filled with clamor, but were also completely sealed. There were no windows to look out of. In each carriage, a person appeared on the large display.Inside the carriage, many prospective fighters were seated.\"Fellow prospective fighters, future fighters, I am from the HR alliance\" a middle-aged man was speaking on the carriage's display, \"I'm sure all of you have heard of the HR alliance before! It's the strongest, wealthiest organization and the organization with the most fighters! I'm sure everyone is also familiar with the HR alliance's other name--The Underground Alliance\"All the prospective fighters inside the carriage quieted down.Luo Feng and Yang Wu sat side by side, heads raised towards the large display.\"Crazy, you've heard of the Underground Alliance before right?\" laughed Yang Wu, \"They are seriously wealthy! The wealthiest organization on earth, even wealthier than a country\"\"I know\"Luo Feng laughed. While he lived in the Ming-Yue sector for the past month, he has learned of many basic information from the fighters in the same area. Prior to the Grand Nirvana period, places like the United States of America and Europe all had powerful families controlling them from behind. For example, the Morgan family, the Rockefeller family, the Onassis family, etc.....These families virtually controlled over half of the world's wealth!However, when the Grand Nirvana period came and the monsters attacked, many smaller countries were destroyed. The larger countries that had powerful armies all fended for themselves and strengthened their governments. At this time, many of the old, powerful families were afraid of being overpowered by the governments' armies. So they teamed up and created--the HR alliance\ufffd\ufffdor the human rights alliance.Human rights alliance, it sounds good. However, it's an alliance that centers around the powerful families. It's called by fighters the 'Underground Alliance'.\"Our alliance has the world's largest communication platform for fighters! Here, you can accept high paying missions\"\"Our alliance has power and influence all over the world! Once you join our alliance and you become one of us, you'll receive top class service whether it's in the USA or the European Union\"\"Our alliance has the largest army and the most power in the government, join us.....\".....The middle-aged man spoke for 15 minutes.\"All future fighters\"A man who had a strict face on appeared on the screen, \"Let me introduce myself. I, am Jiang-Nan city's security agency's deputy chief. My name is Liu. In our country of China, there is no doubt that our government's army is the strongest! Join our government, join our army, and no matter where you go in China, you'll have the greatest support\".....\"Everyone\" the person on the screen changed again, \"I am the chief of Jiang-Nan city's Thunder Dojo headquarters, Wang. Our thunder dojo was created by the fastest and invincible fighter, 'Thunder Lord'. All over the world, our thunder dojo has branches.....\".....\"All future fighters, we have introduced the previous three. No need to say, everyone knows I'm from the dojo of limits!\" the person on the screen changed to another person, \"My name is Zhu Ge! The dojo of limits..... is the strongest dojo on earth and was created by the strongest fighter! In our dojo, we hold the strongest power on earth.....\".....The four advertisements raised up discussion between the prospective fighters in the carriage.\"Second brother, after becoming a fighter, which side will you join? I think the dojo of limits is pretty good\"\"I'll join the Underground Alliance; you can earn the most money there, haha\"\"The Thunder dojo gives fighters better conditions, even a better than the dojo of limits'. Joining the thunder dojo seems like a good choice too\"The excited discussions of the prospective fighters spread around the carriage.Luo Feng and Yang Wu also discussed in a low voice: \"Crazy, my instructor and my senior both joined the dojo of limits. Now, even you have joined the dojo of limits, so of course I will too! Even if I join the dojo of limits, I can still receive missions from the Underground Alliance. We can choose to buy things from both the dojo of limits and from the Underground Alliance\"\"The Dojo of Limits, the Thunder Dojo, the Underground Alliance, and the government's army.....\" Luo Feng was clear.Within all of those powers, the government's army was no doubt the strongest.For the Underground Alliance, which is made out of many powerful families from all over the world, even a country would try to avoid angering them, since the Underground Alliance controls nearly the entire world's economy!The thunder dojo and the dojo of limits are behind the first two in power.However, joining these two large dojos represents freedom!\"Brother Yang, how many prospective fighters do you see on this carriage?\" Luo Feng looked around and saw that there were over a hundred people inside just one carriage.\"There are a lot of people\" Yang Wu curled his lip, \"I just heard from other people's discussions how there are two fighter combat exams each year. And in each fighter combat exam, over a thousand prospective fighters from all over Jiang-Nan city come to take it\"\"Over a thousand?\" Luo Feng was shocked.However, that seemed right, since there was a population of two hundred million in Jiang-Nan city and ten million people in the entirety of Yang-Zhou city. In average, there are just a few dozen more fighters.After a while--\"Fellow prospective fighters, the train will be entering the station shortly, so please prepare to get off\" came a sound from the speaker in the carriage. Shortly after, the train started decelerating until it stopped.The carriages' doors opened and all the prospective fighters from each carriage got off.Very quickly, the mighty crowd of prospective fighters entered a huge military camp, which took a vast amount of space. Various heated weapons could be seen on the outer parts of the camp; one cannon was pointed towards the outskirts of the camp. Large amounts of soldiers were all holding various sophisticated weapons.Luo Feng and the group of prospective fighters looked around.\"Look outside the camp\" Yang Wu excitedly pointed far away.Luo Feng looked carefully and, other than the camp's security line, there were a few starving monsters who were growling. However, these monsters didn't dare approach the camp.[GA~~]An ear-piercing howl made all of the fighters simultaneously raise their heads, and they saw hundreds of densely packed Fei-Qin monsters howl across the dark, blue sky.\"According the the books, after you leave the city, you can see all sorts of monsters. The books were indeed right\" Luo Feng's eyes flashed, \"Humans can only live in the cities or in military camps. Only a fighter can come out here alone and fight with those powerful monsters!\"\"Everyone--\"A loud sound carried to every single fighter's ears, \"Welcome to Jiang-Nan city's northern military sector. This time, the 1680 of you will take your fighter combat exam hosted in our northern military sector. I hope most of you will pass, and I hope all of you will live through this exam!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the same time, there was an extravagant lunch prepared for all the prospective fighters who came to participate in the fighter combat exam.Afternoon.1680 fighters stood in an open plaza. At a reception desk in the plaza sat some high authorities of Jiang-Nan city's northern military sector and some high authorities of the thunder dojo and the dojo of limits.\"Prospective fighters whose names are called, come up and retrieve your uniforms and weapons\"\"Yan Zhuo\"\"He Feng\"\"Wang Bing Jiang\".....There were at least ten officers at the desk yelling names one by one. Prospective fighters whose names were called all went to pick up their uniforms and weapons.\"Luo Feng\"That ringing sound, right when Luo Feng heard it he sprinted up there.\"This is your battle uniform, your battle boots, and the 2nd series ghost blade you need. The heaviest one we prepared was 98 kg, we don't have any heavier ones\" the officer passed a set of objects to Luo Feng, \"Here is a communication watch, which can send mail and has GPS. This is a hexagonal shield\"While the officer was saying that, he was a bit suspicious as he looked into Luo Feng's eyes..... a prospective fighter actually asked for such a heavy ghost blade, quite weird.Luo Feng slightly smiled and sprinted away holding the near 200 kg load of items......In the plaza, each of the 1680 fighters received their requested weapons that were most suitable for them. Each of them used cold weapons! This was the requirement for the fighter combat exam; heated weapons were banned. After they received their things, everyone returned to their own resting areas and changed into their battle gear.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThere was laughter all over the open plaza.At this time, Luo Feng was equipped with his metal alloy battle boots, military standard trousers, and a battle vest with some special Ke-Luo alloy material inside. He also had his hexagonal shield and ghost blade on his back, and was happily talking with the fighter beside him.\"If you put down everything I have equipped, it'll be worth at least 7-10 thousand\" a crew cut teenager excitedly pointed to his uniform, \"This trouser and vest aren't the best fighter equipment. They're only lent to us for the fighter combat exam. However, it can defend against the weakest H grade monster's claws, which is much better than the bullshit bullet proof vests back at town. A regular bullet will never be able to pierce this, and a H grade monster will never be able to rip this apart\"\"You can't rip it apart!\"A girl with a stern expression laughed coldly on the side, \"Even if the monster can't rip apart the uniform, just the impact itself can break your bones and damage your internal organs\"\"This big brother isn't so weak and fragile\" the crew cut teenager sneered and glared at the girl, \"How about, little girl, we go over there and test this brother's strength?\"\"That's enough\" Luo Feng frowned.\"Yes, brother Luo. We'll listen to brother Luo\" the crew cut teenager laughed.The news of Luo Feng being scouted by the dojo of limits was spread from one to ten, and ten to a hundred in the prospective fighter community. Out of the 1680 prospective fighters, only three of them were recruited by the dojo of limits and the thunder dojo! The prospective fighters knew that these three people were special.\"Luo Feng, Luo Feng\" a yelling sound from far away was heard. It was the limit hall's chief instructor, Wu Tong.\"Uncle Wu\"Luo Feng ran towards him after telling Yang Wu and the others beside him. In the past month, Luo Feng lived in the Ming-Yue sector, so naturally he would be close to chief instructor 'Wu Tong', who also lived in the same sector. He called familiarly, 'Uncle Wu'.\"Luo Feng, come with me\" after Wu Tong said that, he started to lead the way.Luo Feng was full of doubts but didn't say anything. They quickly arrived at the second floor of a quiet apartment. In the living room on the second floor, there were lots of people seated together. Luo Feng looked around..... out of all of these people, he only recognized one: one of the Big Four of the Jiang-Nan city's dojo of limits headquarters, Zhu Ge Tao!.\"Chief\" greeted Luo Feng loudly.\"Hm, Luo Feng, go sit over there with Wu Tong\" Zhu Ge Tong, wearing a dark battle uniform with faintly glowing silver pieces, said as he laughed quietly.\"Zhu Ge, this is the Luo Feng you talked about? Let me see, compared to our Thunder Dojo, he isn't that good isn't he\" a burly man wearing a dark, purple battle uniform sat across from Zhu Ge Tao. When he spoke, the sounds seemed to echo within his chest, \"Our thunder dojo recruited two people early, one whose fitness level is on par with your Luo Feng, and another who is a firearms genius\"The burly man looked to the two young men on his side, who immediately stood up in response.\"My name is Wan Dong\" said a teenager who seemed solemn and had a purple birthmark on his face.\"My name is Ma Xiao\" another teenager was smiling and looked beautiful! Yes, we can use the word 'beautiful' for this teenager. If he was born a girl, it would probably be the kind that would bring calamity.Luo Feng smiled and nodded: \"Luo Feng, you already know\"\"Luo Feng\" the solemn teenager spoke, \"Do you have any balls to compete? Tonight at the fighter combat exam, let's see who can get first place!\" The solemn teenager's eyes flashed, as if he saw the most delicious kind of food, full of desire.\"Not interested\" Luo Feng shaked his head.The solemn teenager was startled, but then laughed coldly and didn't say anything further.Zhu Ge Tao and the burly man from the thunder dojo laughed on the side: \"Zhu Ge, your little kiddo seems quite interesting. He's quite calm, didn't let his head get hot when provoked! I kind of like this young man. Luo Feng, any plans to join my thunder dojo.....\"\"Go, go, go\" Zhu Ge Tao glared.\"I'm just joking. Man, you aren't interesting\" the burly man laughed.Zhu Ge Tao glared: \"We should go too. The fighter combat exam is going to start soon!\"------Luo Feng and the 1680 powerful prospective fighters, walked for at least half an hour under the lead of a soldier. They reached the outer part of a town. It was already evening at this time, and the sun has dropped.[Roar~~~]Various howls that makes your heart skip a beat could be heard in the town. The town was surrounded by barbed wire and had a large amount of soldiers patrolling with guns.\"Hurry, there aren't enough monsters inside. Bring another 1200 Iron fur boars, 300 Zhi shadow cats, and another 500 mastiff tigers.\" As the command went through the town, Luo Feng and the others didn't have to wait much longer until they saw huge trucks coming. Each of the trucks had angry howling coming from them.Luo Feng and the large amounts of fighters went to look closely.....In each of the trucks were cages, and in each of the cages were locked up monsters. Those angry howlings made some inexperienced prospective fighters' hearts tremble.\"Luo Feng\"Chief instructor 'Wu Tong' laughed beside Luo Feng, \"Even if you're skilled and strong, that doesn't mean you can kill the monsters! When some people see blood and are faced with a chance of death, they won't even be able to bring out a tenth of their strength. So for this combat exam, the main goal is to train your mind. You have to get used to fighting to the death with monsters and be merciless\"\"Understood\" Luo Feng nodded.\"Hm..... these monsters are all the weakest H level monsters. They're equivalent to a 'Beginner warrior' level fighter\" said Wu Tong, \"Their weak point is their low intellect. However, their strong point is that they are very aggressive and cruel. So in every fighter combat exam, there's always a cruel case where a prospective fighter that dies\"Luo Feng nodded, there's no way that fighting to the death with real monsters could be safe.......After a bunch of weak H level monsters have been imported into the town, the amount of monsters in the town have reached a startling amount.\"Everyone\"A ringing voice carried to every prospective fighter's ears. Luo Feng and every prospective fighter raised their heads to look, and they saw a military officer standing on a ruined three story apartment in the middle of the town as he spoke to all the prospective fighters, \"This time's combat exam will have the same rules as the past ones! From 6:30 PM tonight, we will begin. The exam will end at 6 AM tomorrow!\"\"The more monsters you slaughter, the more points you get. For each monster you slaughter, cut the monster's left ear off as proof\"\"Remember, prospective fighters are not allowed to fight each other. Your movements and actions are all under our surveillance. Those who break the rules will immediately be shot and killed!\"\"Out of you 1680 prospective fighters, the top 60% will earn the right to become a fighter! The other 40% will fail and will have to take the next fighter combat exam\" the officer's voice suddenly became cold, \"In other words, out of the 1680 of you, 1008 will pass and 672 will be disqualified!\"The prospective fighters who were listening below couldn't help but to start talking, an unbelievable 40% will be disqualified!.\"Here's a reminder, usually if one can kill three monsters, they pass. If you can only kill two monsters, it'll be up to luck\" the officers voice resonated in everyone's ears, \"When scores are the same, we use the amount of time used to kill the monsters and how injured you are to determine the rankings. So, when you finish killing the amount of monsters required, hurry and come out of the town\"\"Remember, if you receive a heavy wound, press the emergency help button on your communication watch. Someone will immediately come and save you..... however, that moment also represents the end of your fighter combat exam\" the officer leaped.[WHOOSH!]From the top of the apartment to the ground was at least a height of around 10 meters. And with two more consecutive leaps, he was already outside of town.\"All prospective fighters, move out, and enter monster town\" the officer waved his hand.The 1680 prospective fighters were like a raging wave, and poured into monster town.\"Shut the door!\" ordered the officer.[RUMBLE~~~] the only gate closed shut.The fighter combat exam, officially begins!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yang Wu firmly nodded his head: \"Crazy, this time's fighter combat exam isn't just an exam, more importantly, it's a place for training your courage! When you enter the danger zone alone, the dangers you'll encounter are ten to a hundred times more dangerous than the ones here! If I even need your help in this monster town, then what'll I do in the future?\"Luo Feng nodded: \"You're right. Brother Yang, be careful.\"Okay, Crazy, you should grab your chance too\" reminded Yang Wu, \"This town is all filled with the weakest H level monsters. There probably won't be any more opportunities in the future to train your blade on the weakest level of monsters\"\"I understand. This is a rare chance to train our skill with the blade\" smiled Luo Feng as he nodded.\"Okay, meet you in the town tomorrow morning\" after saying that, Yang Wu looked carefully in all four directions and then swiftly jumped away.Luo Feng also quickly sprinted into a shady area.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdAs nightfall approached, there was a huge searchlight illuminating the borders of the town. Most of the town was lit up, but there were also many places hidden in the dark.\"From what the fighters said in the small sector, the monsters are split into soldiers, commanders, and horde leaders\". Luo Feng held his hexagonal shield with his left hand and his ghost blade with his right as he quietly stood in a ruined alley filled with dust.\"The soldier, or H level monster, is as strong as a human beginner warrior\"\"Even though there are many monsters in this town, there are mainly three different types: the cat monster with the primary trait of speed 'shadow cat', the powerful, heavy class 'Iron fur boars', and the 'Mastiff tiger' whose power and speed are great\" Luo Feng scanned the area.Suddenly, a shadow approached from a ruined two story apartment. With Luo Feng's great vision, he saw that the shadow's fur was sharp as needles and was at least 1.5 meters tall. Its mouth had two gigantic tusks which reflected the light from the searchlight, which could make one's heart skip a beat.A regular boar that humans eat is probably only 60-70 cm tall.In other words, this monster is at least double the size of a domestic pig, almost as if it was a small truck.\"Iron fur boar? My first prey will be you\" Luo Feng watched the iron fur boar and came out of the alley, right into the iron fur boar's field of vision.[Growl~~]As he stared at the iron fur boar in the eye, he held up his shield and blade. The monster made a weird growling sound and suddenly fiercely stepped on the concrete surface, making a cloud of dust. It carried a putrid current with it as it charged towards Luo Feng, as if it was a heavy hummer flying towards him.The two long, sharp tusks pointed forward like gigantic scimitars.[HU!] Right when the iron fur boar charged, Luo Feng quickly dodged to the side; the iron fur boar didn't even have time to stop during its charge. And with a quick flash in his eyes, all the power on his body focused in his arm and unrelentlessly made a slash with his ghost blade! The ghost blade cut right across the iron fur boar's neck![THUMP]The head of the iron fur boar was immediately detached from its body and flew up high. Fresh blood was spewing out of the area where it was cut from and the body also flew at least 10 meters before falling. The body twitched for a bit on the ground and then finally died.\"Hu, hu\" Luo Feng took in two deep breaths. Luo Feng's heart shaked a bit after witnessing the gory scene.Killing monsters.....Killing a monster for the first time can indeed be a shock.\"No wonder uncle Wu said that some prospective fighters can't bring out their strength after witnessing blood\" Luo Feng reflected on his battle, \"The dodge just now was done pretty well, but..... the way I slashed across the iron fur boar's neck used up unnecessary strength. However, a regular prospective fighter probably could never cut off the iron fur boar's head\"The iron fur boar's defense was powerful, but that was for a regular prospective fighter.Luo Feng's current strength is on par with an intermediate warrior level fighter. Fighting with this iron fur boar is just like bullying.\"According to my fighter brothers at the Ming-Yue sector, you can't just use brute force when dealing with monsters. You have to grasp their weak point\"\"Also, I can't believe I let my heart waver when I severed the iron fur boar's head. I must get used to this! In the future, I'll be fighting with monsters all the time with my life on the line. If my heart isn't prepared, I might lose my life in a crucial moment\" Luo Feng understood that the more crucial the moment is, the more calm you have to be.However, Luo Feng's state of mind was pretty good, since people usually have a much larger reaction towards their first kill.Luo Feng walked towards the boar's head, and with one swipe of his hand -He cut off the boar's left ear and put it inside the bag he was carrying, \"First one! Now towards the next!\" with a slight movement of his body, Luo Feng has already disappeared from the street. Only the corpse of the iron fur boar remained on the blood stained street......With every passing second in this enclosed town, there were bloody battles taking place in every corner! Even though the H level monsters are close to the prospective fighters in power, the humans have one advantage: intellect! The weakest H level monsters don't have much intellect; only some basic bestial instincts.Around 8 PM.On a six story high apartment, two shadows were swiftly fighting with each other.[HUA!]A cold light shone, Luo Feng's was kneeling on the platform. A trace of blood could be seen on the ghost blade he was holding. The other shadow was helplessly thrown aside as it left behind a trail of blood.\"This shadow cat is the fastest one out of the three monsters. Even though it's a H level monster, it has a speed of 40 m/s\" Luo Feng stood up and walked over to it. The shadow cat on the floor's fur was grey and its body wasn't too big; around half a meter long. This shadow cat's abdomen had a staggering wound; even the inner organs were slashed open by Luo Feng's attack.\"For regular prospective fighters, this cat does indeed pose a threat. However, too bad it met me\" Luo Feng shaked his head and cut off the shadow cat's left year.Luo Feng's speed is way faster than the shadow cat's.There's no helping it, since Luo Feng has already reached the level of an intermediate warrior. And within the intermediate warrior level fighters, Luo Feng counts as a stronger one.\"Fifth\"Luo Feng carefully put away the spoils of war, \"Usually, there's a hundred percent chance of passing if you can kill three monsters. I already killed five, so I pass for sure! Then now..... I'll start seriously training my agility and blade\". He killed monsters for points before, and now he has enough points.\"I'll use 1000 kg of fist strength and 30 m/s of speed to start fighting with these monsters\"Luo Feng was practically bullying the monsters, since they were on a completely different level.But now, Luo Feng has suppressed his strength to make it equal with the enemies', so there's actually a point in training. When you enter the danger zone in the future, you can't just keep killing monsters weaker than you every time.\"Begin!\"Luo Feng was standing on the balcony of a residential apartment as he looked around and below him.\"Hm? First one!\" Luo Feng saw a mastiff tiger, whose body was full of spots, near the top of a ruined three story apartment out of the corner of his eye. Luo Feng immediately flew towards it. With just one leap off of the balcony, he flew more than 10 meters and heavily landed onto the ruined roof, even the floor violently shook as he landed.Luo Feng rolled on the ground with the force of the impact and directly flew towards the mastiff tiger.[HOWL~~~] The mastiff tiger also came flying towards......A grim teenager, whose shirt was stained with blood, carried a darkmoon blade as he arrogantly walked on the street.\"I wonder how many monsters Luo Feng has killed\" thought the grim teenager. He is the only one out of the 1680 fighters whose strength is close to Luo Feng's. The genius who was scouted by the Thunder dojo, 'Wan Dong'. Although this time, there were three people who were scouted.However, one of them is a firearms genius whose fitness level isn't that high.Only Luo Feng and this Wan Dong are geniuses with similar fitness levels.\"Hm?\" Wan Dong's gaze landed at a location.He only saw a shadow constantly fighting with two shadow cats. The two shadow cats hissed and speedily attacked with their claws. However, the shadow dexterously dodged the attacks as he fought the two shadow cats.\"Luo Feng! It takes you so long just to kill two shadow cats? I am so disappointed in you\" shouted Wan Dong as he laughed.[CHI!] [CHI!]As if lightning, the ghost blade in Luo Feng's hand made two slashes, and the two shadow cats immediately fell to the floor. After a few twitches, they stopped moving.\"So quick\" Wan Dong was shocked and thought to himself, \"And the blade made a clean cut towards the weak points of the shadow cats\". Wan Dong saw from Luo Feng's two slashes that Luo Feng's strength was not to be underestimated.\"I was going to play with you a bit more and continue training myself\" Luo Feng looked at the corpses of the two shadow cats, \"However, that guy is annoying and I don't want him to see me training my agility and blade\" Luo Feng cut off the two shadow cats' ears, put it into his bag, and disappeared without even looking at Wan Dong once.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some powerful prospective fighters get pumped up and excited after killing monsters!In a place not too far from the enclosed town, there was a large security screen in a tall structure displaying everything happening in each sector in the town.\"What a weak strategy!\" In one of the rooms of this large structure, a military officer was drinking with a burly man. The screens on the sidewalls were displaying the slaughter going on in the city. The burly man sighed, \"Watching these young men fight with these monsters reminds me of when we were young!\"\"Yea, from a glance, most of them are all around 20 years old, which is the youngest yet most fragile point of their lives\" the military officer also sighed, \"Old Wang, after a blink of an eye, we two brothers have become old. Back in the day, we were rookies in Jiang-Nan city too. Now you're the chief of the Thunder Dojo, haha\"The burly man laughed loudly, \"Iron monkey, didn't you also get your way to major general\"\"Hm?\" the military instructor looked with shock at the display. The more he looked, the more shocked he became, \"Old Wang, hurry and look\"On the display was several videos of the town. Since there were so many cameras recording, the videos on the display change every so often.\"It changed?\" the military officer immediately pressed the telephone on the side and commanded, \"Lock onto the prospective fighter just now from camera #21, lock onto him\"\"Yes\" an impressive sound came from the telephone.The burly man Wang looked suspiciously at his good brother: \"Iron monkey, what did you just see?\"\"Old Wang, you'll see soon\" the military instructor laughed mysteriously.In just a moment, the display changed to the video from before. in the video was five shadow cats constantly attacking a prospective fighter. These five shadow cats were five H level shadow cats, and the prospective fighter held a hexagonal shield, a ghost blade, and looked very young, it was indeed Luo Feng!\"Oh?\" the burly man's eyes flashed.\"How about this? This kiddo's strong isn't he\" said the military officer, \"This kiddo actually used this exam as a free chance to train himself! And look..... his technique is insane!\"\"Ru Wei class!\"\"The Ru Wei class!\" the burly man's eyes flashed and stared at the five shadow cats who were attacking Luo Feng. Each of Luo Feng's dodges didn't make much motion, but easily dodged every attack from each of the shadow cats. The taste of this stroll completely took over these two powerful men!The Ru Wei class technique, even many warlord level fighters can't do it.\"His technique actually reached the Ru Wei class. Amazing, amazing!\" the burly man took in a breath, \"he's only 18 years old. His technique is just as good as his fitness level. With good talent, your fitness level will be high. However, technique results from battle experience and a clear understanding of the basics. Only then can you enter the 'Ru Wei class'.\"How did you know he's 18 years old?\" the military officer jumped in surprise, \"You know him?\"\"He's Luo Feng. Fuck, the Dojo of Limits recruited him first\" angrily shouted the burly man, \"The dojo of limits sure had some bullshit luck. This Luo Feng is only 18, but not only is his fitness level fantastic, but his technique is also amazing! Ru Wei class at this age, what will he become in the future?\"Understand.....That even powerful warlord level fighters haven't reached the Ru Wei class in technique! Clearly your technique has to be insanely good to get into this level.In real combat, fitness level is just one side. Technique, skill, and willpower also come into play.\"NO!\"The burly man slammed the table, \"We can't let the Dojo of Limits steal this genius! Thankfully I was lucky and saw this scene while drinking with you, iron monkey\"\"What are you planning to do?\" laughed the military officer.\"What? Win him over!\" the burly man glared, \"I'll win him over no matter what! The Dojo of Limits might've not noticed this, but this young man's technique is astonishing. I'll win him over first! Isn't it just money? Hmph! Sure am lucky to encounter such a talented young man. Compared to him, Wan Dong is off by 18,000 miles!\"The military officer laughed.\"Iron monkey, make a copy of this recording for me later\" said the burly man.\"Sure, no problem\" laughed the military officer as he nodded.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIn the dawn of the day in the enclosed monster town, Luo Feng encountered and was surrounded by three mastiff tigers, two shadow cats, and two iron fur boars in a ruined sector. It took quite a bit of energy to gather up all seven of these monsters here.\"Good\"\"Keep coming\"\"Just like that\"Luo Feng was calm, and as if taking a walk, he occasionally stepped left, occasionally stepped right, and forwards, and backwards. Sometimes he would slightly bend his waist, sometimes he would bend his body.....With just these small, slight movements, the seven monsters couldn't even touch a hair of Luo Feng's body.\"Growl~~~\" from the corner of his eye, Luo Feng noticed a mastiff tiger flying at him. Around him were four more monsters preparing to attack at the same time. Looking at the situation, his foot turned and his body immediately moved.\"Not good, barely missed!\" thought Luo Feng hopelessly.It seemed like the shadow cat's claw was about to grab onto Luo Feng's body, but strangely enough, Luo Feng's body suddenly moved five cm, which allowed him to just barely miss the attack.\"It sure is quite a challenge learning the legendary Ru Wei class technique\" it seemed like Luo Feng dodged all the attacks, but in fact..... Luo Feng himself was clear, he failed! Because in the last moment he used his spiritual force on the hexagonal shield on his left arm to create a force of propulsion!It was because of this force that Luo Feng was able to move that 5 cm!In a battle, your technique is extremely important, which is why Luo Feng has been training his technique the entire night. Usually..... technique training requires a very solid understanding in the basics, which usually takes ten years of bitter work. And fighting with monsters for years drills the ways to dodge into your consciousness. Once you train enough, your reflexes will come in play no matter what the situation.Solid understanding in the basics, tons of training, and reflexes!These three levels are the basics of technique. Above these three is..... the Ru Wei class!The Ru Wei class means that you have virtually complete control over your strength and body and are able to use the smallest amount of energy to just barely dodge the attack. All kinds of dodging, just like it has been calculated by a computer! The reason why the Ru Wei class technique is so hard is because when you are just barely dodging, any kind of mistake will lead to the attack from the monster striking you! Once you are hit by a monster, most people get heavily injured, if not killed.When training in the Ru Wei class technique, it isn't really effective to train with monsters who are much weaker than you.Luo Feng is being attacked by seven monsters right now; his strength and speed are being used to their utmost capabilities. However, it is too difficult to not get touched at all when surrounded by seven monsters.\"I guess I'm in the Ru Wei class now?\"\"I also use the smallest, slightest of movements to delicately dodge. Of course errors will happen sometimes\" Luo Feng felt a bit tired, so the ghost blade that never attacked suddenly flourished and the monsters cried in anguish. Five streams of fresh blood poured out and five out of the seven monsters were instantly killed. The other two realized the situation and ran away.\"However.....\"\"After this night of training, my technique has at least doubled in skill\" Luo Feng let out a smile, what kind of training could compare to real combat experience with a monster? And what kind of combat with monsters could compare with Luo Feng's extreme training?Only by challenging your body's limits can you know the where the limit of your dodges are.This night of training has benefited Luo Feng greatly.Luo Feng is stronger than a H level mastiff tiger, shadow cat, and an iron fur boar in a one on one. However, seven monsters can kill a person. A fist can have 3000 kg of strength, but a 2000 kg charge from a monster is enough to heavily injure Luo Feng!Even that genius 'Wan Dong' wouldn't attempt such an extreme type of training!Or else, you might get pulled apart by the seven monsters.But Luo Feng would dare to attempt such a thing!Because he has his spiritual force. If he ever encounters any sort of danger, he can just use his spiritual force on his shield or his ghost blade to give him a boost and use that to dodge.\"Too bad this spiritual force can only be used on inanimate objects. Once it gets near a person, it gets absorbed into it\" Luo Feng shaked his head, his spiritual force couldn't be used to control humans and animals. He can only control things such as metal and wood. However, the spiritual force already gave Luo Feng plenty of joy.At least.... he's skilled enough for Ru Wei class dodging.Of course, it was a different type of Ru Wei dodging. Since when he makes a mistake he can just use his spiritual force for a boost. However, just his dodging ability alone isn't any worse than the regular Ru Wei class. And it's also even more strange![BEEP~~~BEEP~~~BEEP~~~]An ear piercing sound suddenly rang through the entire town. At the same time, a heavy voice also spread across the entire town, \"Time's up, all prospective fighters immediately return to the exit of the town\".\"The fighter combat exam is over?\" Luo Feng laughed.\"I'll keep doing this kind of Ru Wei class technique training until the day I won't need my spiritual force to help me. My technique will also reach the Ru Wei class\" Luo Feng cut off the left ears of the five monsters, put it in his bag, and rushed towards the main gate of monster town.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Virtually every prospective fighter had a few blood stains on them, whether it was their own blood or the monster's blood. There were even some prospective fighters who were being carried out by their friends.[BEEP~BEEP~]An ear piercing sound rang and a large, heavy truck came out of the town. The truck was filled with the monster's corpses.\"Hey, these are the prospective fighters corpses, someone come pick them up\" One of the large trucks stopped at the side, and there were indeed quite a bit of corpses. Some of them were missing large parts of their body, which were clearly bitten off by monsters. The truck dumped these corpses to the side.\"Ah!\"\"Gan!\"\"Yin!\"Within a moment, quite a few prospective fighters were crying out. Some of them even went to the corpses and wailed.\"What are you crying about?\" a cold, domineering voice rang from a military officer, which caused quite a few angry glances to look over at him. But this military officer scanned the surroundings coldly, \"Who doesn't die when fighting with monsters! You chose to take the path of a fighter, so prepare yourself to die! Society gives fighters special rights, why? Not for you to enjoy it, but because you kill large amounts of monsters which benefits humanity. That's why you receive special benefits\"\"Your position, your authority..... you have to put your life on the line to receive all of this!\"\"In this exercise you were given only the weakest of monsters, and they aren't even the type to form packs. If you can't even pass this, how will you expect to survive in the wilderness?\" the officer's speech made every prospective fighter quiet down, since they barely knew anything about monsters.The most difficult monster to deal with are the 'pack types', like the dog type 'mastiff lion' every time they move they move in a pack of around ten, so even an intermediate level fighter wouldn't approach them.\"Two monster's left ears, next, injured left arm\"\"Lu Fang? Ok, three monster's left ears, not bad, next\"At the entrance of the town, each prospective fighter that came out went to turn in their ears they received from the slaughter to prove how many monsters they killed.\"Look, Luo Feng came out\"\"It's the Luo Feng that the Dojo of Limits scouted\"\"I wonder how many monsters he killed\"\"JUst because his body fitness level is good doesn't mean he'll be good at killing monsters too\"Most of the prospective fighters have already came out, and all of them were focusing on Luo Feng, who just walked out of the entrance. Luo Feng, Wan Dong, and Ma Xiao, these three were the prospective fighters that were scouted. One to ten, and ten to a hundred, almost everyone here recognizes Luo Feng and the others.\"Hm?\" Right when he walked out, he was being stared at by a huge amount of prospective fighters, so Luo Feng couldn't help but to waver.\"Luo Feng, correct? Hand over the monster's left ears to me\" there were three military officers sitting ahead, and two of them were using laptops while one of them was looking at Luo Feng.\"Yes\"Luo Feng nodded and put down the bag he was carrying. Within a moment, a large amount of prospective fighters gathered around and their gazes were all focused on Luo Feng's bag. They were all curious..... how many monsters did Luo Feng kill.[HUA!] Luo Feng immediately turned the bag upside down and poured the large amount of ears into the metal pot. A small pile formed, which filled over half the pot.\"So many?\"\"This guy killed so many monsters?\" All the prospective fighters watching from afar were shocked.At that time, the military officer was counting up the ears, and soon after he smiled as he looked at Luo Feng: \"Luo Feng, not bad, 36 monster's left ears in total. Until now, you have the most confirmed kills. Hm, and you aren't injured either\"\"Next\" the military officer looked towards the oncoming people and Luo Feng smiled as he walked away.\"After I pass the fighter combat exam, I'll become a true fighter too\" Luo Feng was overjoyed.After that, Luo Feng joined the crowd and watched as the other people handed in their monster's left ears. Some of them had no injury at all, but most of them were lightly injured, which would heal up in around 10 to 15 days of rest. There were also heavily injured prospective fighters.\"Yang Wu, hm, not bad, three monster's left ears, a light wound on the left shoulder. Next\"Yang Wu also came back safely.\"Brother Yang\" shouted Luo Feng from the crowd.\"Crazy\" Yang Wu laughed loudly as he rushed over, \"How'd you do? How many monsters did you kill?\"\"36\" Luo Feng and Yang Wu walked towards a corner.\"36? Fuck, Crazy you're insane. These monsters were so hard to kill\" Yang Wu glanced, \"Especially that mastiff tiger, it was faster than me and don't even get me started on its power! Its level is the same, but its power is way higher than a human fighter's. I pushed my life on the line just to kill three\".Luo Feng laughed, indeed, you can't underestimate H level monsters. Even an intermediate warrior will have trouble facing seven or eight of them.Luo Feng could only train like he did because of his spiritual force.\"Wan Dong!\"\"It's Wan Dong, the genius prospective fighter the thunder dojo scouted. I wonder how many monster's left ears he collected. I wonder, compared to Luo Feng, who's stronger\"\"Yea, the only person who can compete with Luo Feng is this Wan Dong\"A wave of discussion arose, which made Luo Feng and Yang Wu, who were hiding at the back, raise their heads in surprisement. Yang Wu was even more shocked as he said: \"that Wan Dong took until now to come out? Crazy, apparently that Wan Dong's body fitness level isn't any worse than yours. I wonder how many monsters he killed\"At this time, the prospective fighters standing at the front all stared at Wan Dong's bag. And the prospective fighters at the back all listened closely.\"There's a bunch of monster's left ears\"\"It seems like there's a lot\"A lot of noise followed, and then the military officer's voice carried out--\"Wan Dong, hm, 51 monster's left ears in total. Haha, you have surpassed Luo Feng, and are temporarily the prospective fighter with the most confirmed kills\"\"51?\"\"So much more than Luo Feng?\"\"This Wan Dong is indeed strong. 51 monsters is out of this world\"The prospective fighters who have experienced the might of the monsters themselves were shocked speechless.\"Crazy, this Wan Dong has so many more than you\" Yang Wu was shocked.\"Is there a point in killing so many?\" Luo Feng gave a laugh that couldn't care less. He spent the entire night training his technique. If he really wanted to kill the weakest H level monsters, with Luo Feng's strength, he can just pick off monsters that are alone. With that, even a hundred kills in a night wouldn't be weird.\"Luo Feng\" a voice rang.Luo Feng turned his head and saw a military officer with a large mustache smile: \"Come with me, a friend wants to meet you, right at the resting lounge ahead\"\"Oh?\" Luo Feng was a bit suspicious.....Meet me?But Luo Feng made no delay and immediately followed the large mustached man to the resting lounge. Before he entered, Luo Feng took off his blood stained battle uniform and washed it a bit. He then changed into some fresh, clean clothes before entering.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIn the resting lounge, a burly man sat there with his eyes shut. They suddenly opened and, like lightning, looked at Luo Feng.\"Him?\" Luo Feng was shocked.This man he knew, it was the man who was talking to Chief Instructor Zhu Ge, and one of the big four from the Thunder Dojo in Jiang-Nan city.\"My name is Wang Heng, and I'm the chief instructor of the thunder dojo\" the man laughed, \"Luo Feng, sit\".Sit with this chief instructor face to face?Luo Feng was shocked inside.He completely understood how much authority this man held. A dojo's chief instructor's authority could be compared to a wargod's! They have an astonishing amount of power. You could say that this burly man has Jiang-Nan city in his hands.\"Why don't you sit, scared I'll bite you? Haha...\" the burly man started laughing loudly.Luo Feng laughed and sat in front of him and said, \"Mr. Wang, what business do you have with me today?\"\"It's simple\"The burly man smiled, \"I looked into your family's situation. You came from a regular family and your father works at a remodeling company while your mother works as a cashier in the supermarket. Your background isn't that good, and yet you've been able to get to where you are at a mere 18 years old, which is really rare\"Luo Feng let out a complicated smile, indeed, he has worked far too long for this day.\"I really appreciate you, and I think you have a bright future\"\"I officially invite you, Luo Feng, to join my thunder dojo!\" The burly man looked at Luo Feng.\"I, I already signed a contract with the dojo of limits\" Luo Feng smiled as he shaked his head.The unconvinced burly man shaked his head and said, \"A contract? If it's a contract, you can just break it! It's just a fee you have to pay. According to the fighter rules, the payment won't exceed one hundred million. I believe that you are worth far more than this price! Our thunder dojo will pay this price for you!\"\"Also, if you join, I'll arrange a special training contract for you in our main worldwide thunder dojo headquarters!\" The burly man laughed, \"Every year, no more than 10 fighters will receive this invitation. Each of them will be a one of a kind genius. So far, we only sent out three invitations this year. One of them is a 20 year old advanced fighter from the European Union. Another genius from South America is a spirit reader! And our third is from Jiang-Hua city of China, a 16 year old intermediate fighter. You'll be the fourth!\"Luo Feng couldn't help but to be shocked.Each of the three were disgustingly strong. Clearly, the 'Wan Dong' and 'Ma Xiao' who were scouted weren't qualified enough for this invitation.But I am?Truthfully, with just Luo Feng's fitness level, he isn't qualified for such a contract. However, along with this, he also has--his knowledge of the Ru Wei technique\ufffd\ufffdThis is enough for Luo Feng to receive the special training contract invitation. Since Luo Feng, who is only 18, has amazingly been able to learn the Ru Wei technique.\"As long as you join my thunder dojo, I'll give you this contract and send you to our worldwide headquarters for training. You might even have a chance to get personally tutored by the legendary 'Thunder Lord'\" The burly man smiled as he said, \"Luo Feng, our thunder dojo wholeheartedly invites you, to join us!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I haven't thought about transferring, so I am truly sorry\"Wang Heng was startled.Rejected?\"You don't want to take your time to think about this?\" The burly man stared with his eyebrows raised.\"No\" Luo Feng stood up and bowed, \"Mr. Wang, if there's nothing else, then I'll be on my way\" Luo Feng knew that things would just get awkward if he stayed after rejecting the offer.Wang Heng stared at Luo Feng closely.This young man doesn't even falter in the face of temptation. Wang Heng couldn't help but to sigh. He waved his hand and laughed, \"Alright, I won't nag you anymore. If you ever change your mind, the gates to my Thunder Dojo will always be open for you\"\"Thank you, Mr. Wang\" Luo Feng smiled as he left.Right when Luo Feng left, Wang Heng's face sank and he shouted, \"Tell Wan Dong to come\"\"Yes, Chief\"The people outside immediately went to notify Wan Dong.\"I can't believe I just lost another genius to the Dojo of Limits\" Wang Heng stroked his chin and his eyes squinted like a tiger's, \" Ever since 'Phantom Warlord' retired because of a major injury, our Jiang-Nan city's Thunder Dojo has always been at a disadvantage compared to the Dojo of Limits. Shit!\"Wang Heng is also nervous!In the entire world, the Dojo of Limits and the Thunder Dojo are the two largest dojos! The creators of the dojos are the strongest and second strongest fighters! Naturally, the higher ups of each would greet each other with smiling faces. But in truth, they were completely against each other!\"However, in Jiang-Nan city, the Dojo of Limits has stronger influence.\"Chief\". The cold teenager Wan Dong walked over.Even in Wan Dong's look, he was full of confidence! Since he got more kills than Luo Feng in this time's fighter combat exam and he ranked number one, his confidence has been growing.\"Hm, Wan Dong\" Wang Heng let out a smile, \"You are our Thunder Dojo's best new recruit! However..... with your current power, you still cannot compare to Luo Feng\"\"Chief\" Wan Dong was startled.I can't compare to Luo Feng?\"Do you doubt my words?\" Wang Heng raised his eyebrows.Wan Dong shook his head, he knew the Chief Instructor in front of him used to be an advanced warlord. At the same time, he has the various special rights granted to him by the title of 'Chief Instructor'. His authority rivals a wargod's. How could this person spread lies?\"I'll tell you truthfully. Your body fitness level isn't worse than his. However, in a real battle, even three of you cannot defeat one Luo Feng\" Wang Heng said heavily, \"However, even though the current gap between you and him is large doesn't mean you'll always be weaker than him. What you need to do is seriously work hard and surpass him\"\"I've met quite a few geniuses, but many geniuses fall!\"\"A fighter walks on the border of life and death! Your good talent only means that you improve faster. Now that you just became a fighter..... your path just began! Don't loosen up no matter what, Luo Feng is only the first opponent you must surpass. In the future you'll be surpassing many more opponents\" Wang Heng encouraged, \"I hope one day, I'll be able to witness the birth of a new wargod!\"Wan Dong's blood boiled as he listened.Yes, Luo Feng is just the first opponent. He'll have to continuously surpass others until achieves the rank of wargod!\"Alright, go now. You've been slaughtering all night, so you should rest\" Wang Heng smiled.\"Yes, Chief\" Wan Dong left respectfully.Wang Heng shook his head and sipped some tea. Ever since carrying the burden of the position of 'Chief Instructor', he's been thinking of ways to help geniuses grow. Or to pressure them or attract them with scrolls and money to bring them to his dojo.The more fighters he raises, the more solid his position becomes.\"This Wan Dong might be able to give me a surprise in the future\" laughed Wang Heng, \"However, I won't ask too much of him for now. It'll be great if he could just reach Luo Feng. Heh..... Ru-Wei class at 18 years old and such a high body fitness level. What a great seed\" Wang Heng shook his head and drank some tea as he tried not to think about it anymore.Yes, no matter what, Luo Feng and Wan Dong are just \"good seeds\".\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIn the northern military sector of Jiang-Nan city, Luo Feng and Yang Wu, who have already changed into casual clothes, were chatting as they walked.\"Crazy, there was something wrong with Wan Dong's look as he glanced at you just now.... He even said he wanted to compete with you and see who can become a warlord first\" Yang Wu said confusedly.\"Who knows what's going on. It seems like Wan Dong already sees me as an opponent\" Luo Feng was also suspicious towards Wan Dong's words.What he didn't know was that after Wan Dong listened to Wang Heng's words, Wan Dong has already treated Luo Feng as his first opponent!\"I gotta tell my family that I passed the exam\" Luo Feng smiled as he took out his cell phone, \"Brother Yang, you have to notify your family about the results too\"\"Yup\" Yang Wu laughed as he nodded.Luo Feng and Yang Wu both called their family's home phone......In one of Jiang-Nan city's eight major cities, Yang Zhou city's Ming-Yue sector.\"Hong Guo, your family's Luo Feng will surely be able to pass this time's fighter combat exam\" Parents Luo Hong Guo and Gong Xin Lan pushed their son Luo Hua's wheelchair and chatted with a balding old man.\"Is the fighter combat exam dangerous?\" Gong Xin Lan couldn't help but to ask, \"My family's Feng said there was no danger, but we checked online and we read that it actually was dangerous\"\"Yes, it is a bit dangerous\" The balding old man nodded, \"According to what my son said, in a typical fighter combat exam, there's usually a 3% to 5% death rate and around a 5% to 8% chance to become disabled. In other words, over a hundred prospective fighters are trashed\"Luo Hong Guo and Gong Xin Lan exchanged glances, both of them extremely anxious.\"Your family's Feng is surely absolutely fine, so take it easy\" laughed the balding old man.\"Yes, yes\" Luo Hong Guo and Gong Xin Lan nodded. Although they did that on the outside, the husband and wife pair were still incredibly anxious inside.Luo Hua said nothing as he sat on his wheelchair, but his fists were tightly clenched.Suddenly-A cheerful ringtone started ringing, and mother Gong Xin Lan took her cell phone out of her pocket and let out a face of joy. As she looked at the cell phone she said: \"It's Feng's phone number\"\"Hurry up and answer it\" said Luo Hong Guo.Luo Hua also stared at the phone, and even the balding old man smiled as he watched on the side.\"Hello\" Gong Xin Lan answered.\"Mom, I passed the fighter combat exam. I'll be able to return home tonight, so you better prepare good food\" the sound carried from the cell phone and everyone around heard it.Father Luo Hong Guo laughed and Luo Hua finally relaxed his clench fist and laughed along.\"Great, great, Mom will definitely prepare lots of good food\" Gong Xin Lan was extremely excited.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdAugust 2nd, evening, Yang Zhou city's Ming-Yue sector.\"Luo Feng is back, congratulations\"\"Congratulations my ass, that fighter combat exam was easy as pie to Luo Feng\"As Luo Feng walked, he smiled as he greeted several fighters. There are way fewer fighters than regular people in society. In this Ming-Yue sector, all the families here are fighter's. Not only that, but all of them have joined the Dojo of Limits, so naturally their relationship would be good.\"Mom, Dad\" Luo Feng saw his parents and the home's nanny all standing in front of the door to home.\"Let's eat, let's eat\" Luo Hong Guo immediately started laughing.That night Luo Feng and his family had a great time, since starting from now, from the perspective of the law, Luo Feng is officially a fighter!Until after 11 PM.Inside Luo Feng's recording room on the second floor of his home.\"They said that after you become an official fighter, you can enter the Dojo of Limit's internal fighter network!\" Luo Feng was a bit excited, some special internal networks require a special identification to enter. Only the fighters of the Dojo of Limits have the right to enter the internal fighter network -- Home of Limits!And as long as you're a fighter, you'll be able to log into the HR alliance channel.\"Home of Limits\" Luo Feng typed in the URL through his keyboard.After a moment, a large screen that was easily 200 inches appeared on one of the walls of the video recording room. The screen immediately displayed the website 'Home of Limits'.[beep] Luo Feng finished validating his fingerprint.Elegant music like a flowing river played throughout the video room. At the same time, the large screen showed the profiles of individual people. One of those profiles had Luo Feng's photo on it, and below it was this information form--Name: Luo FengSex: MaleAddress: Jiang-Nan city, ChinaFighter identification number: 426123205608010002Level: Warrior (intermediate)Contribution: 0 PointsBalance: 20000000 Chinese dollarsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His gaze, however, was focused on the huge screen on the wall of the video recording room: \"Twenty million Chinese dollars? The money that the Dojo of Limits promised to me certainly did arrive\". There were a row of buttons on the very top of the webpage.One of them continuously flashed and read - \"You have two new messages\"Luo Feng's finger lightly tapped the wireless keyboard's touch screen to open the messages.[HUA!]The first message opened and a video message came out.\"Hello, Mr. Luo Feng\" A middle-aged man wearing a black suit appeared on the huge screen. He smiled as he said, \"I am Chief Zhu Ge's assistant. I'm sure you have already seen the twenty million that Chief Zhu Ge promised you. To buy your blade, agility, and technique scrolls, you can purchase them through the internal network. As long as their price doesn't exceed 100 million, the internal network will transfer the payments to the Dojo of Limits so you won't have to pay. However, if the cost exceeds 100 million, then Mr. Luo Feng will have to pay the exceeding part. At the same time, I represent the Chief to congratulate Mr. Luo Feng's success in the fighter combat exam\"After that was said, the video came to an end.\"The Dojo of Limits is treating me quite well\" Luo Feng opened the second message.This message also contained a video.\"Hello, respected new fighter 'Luo Feng'. I represent the Dojo of Limits, and I welcome you to our large family\" A kind faced woman smiled as she said, \"This is your first time entering the Dojo of Limits' internal network--Home of Limits! Allow me to tell you how to use the various functions of the Home of Limits\"\"First, in the Home of Limits, you can purchase various weapons, techniques, agility scrolls, and offensive scrolls like blade scrolls, spear scrolls, sword scrolls, etc. There are also heated weapons, transportation tools, protective gears, communication systems, special bombs, special medicines, genetic medicines......There are even some rare ingredients and treasures. As long as you have enough money, you can buy all of them\"\"Once you pay, the good will arrive within 24 hours\"\"Through the Limit Home, you can even ask for a warlord or even a wargod fighter to tutor you one on one through the internet. Likewise, you have to be able to pay the money\"The girl in the video smiled and said, \"If you have enough contribution points, then all the goods described above will be half price!\"Luo Feng was shocked after hearing this.Half?So as long as he has enough contribution points, a good that's worth 100 million can be bought for fifty million? There sure are many places to use these contribution points. However, his contribution points still remain at 0 right now.\"There are many uses for contribution points. Not only can you buy goods with them, but once you reach a certain point, you can use them to call the special forces of the Dojo of Limits\" the girl in the video smiled and said, \"Higher contribution points represents more power, benefits, and authority in my Dojo of Limits\"\"There are two main ways to earn contribution points\"\"First, you can kill monsters and pick certain materials from their bodies, and sell these important materials to the Dojo of Limits! You can earn money and contribution points this way\"\"Second, you can donate to the Dojo of Limits. The more you donate, the more contribution points you receive. The rate right now is..... 10 thousand Chinese dollars for one contribution point! In the donation system, the minimum donation is 10 million Chinese dollars, and the maximum amount a fighter can donate is 100 billion. In other words--through the donation system, you can earn up to 10 million contribution points!\"After Luo Feng heard this, he took a deep breath.The fuck?There's a limit to donating? The maximum is 100 billion? They won't accept any more than that? 100 billion chinese dollars, it seems like the richest man in China only has a little more than 100 billion. In the Forbes ranking for the wealthiest people on earth, the richest man only has like 120 billion American dollars, which is equivalent to 420 billion Chinese dollars.Of course, Forbes ranks only the surface. Some huge families' entire savings exceed some of the richest people. However, that's an entire family's savings.\"Mr. Luo Feng, let me remind you that the best way to earn contribution points is by hunting monsters. Not only can you earn contribution points, but also earn money\" the girl in the video smiled and said, \"Even though you have a large principal, don't buy things immediately. You can enter the fighter's discussion database and carefully learn some of the basic knowledge a fighter needs. This will help you when you're picking a scroll or buying a weapon\"\"Finally, I hope Mr. Luo Feng can get to the very top of the fighters in our huge family in the Dojo of Limits\"After saying that, the girl in the video bowed and then the video ended.Luo Feng was speechless after listening.....There is indeed a huge use for the internal network 'Home of Limits'. The thing that attracts Luo Feng the most is that you could actually use money to get a warlord or even a wargod level fighter to tutor you one on one through the internet.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdEven though he had twenty million Chinese dollars, Luo Feng wasn't in a rush to buy any of the weapons. He first tried to get used to the Home of Limits' internal network. The Home of Limits website has many functions. There were a wide variety of different boards: receiving missions, posting missions, chatting, training, and donating.However, the two largest boards that attracted Luo Feng were the 'Fighter discussions' and 'Internet market' boards.In the internet market, there were all sorts of Dao Yin technique scrolls, agility scrolls, blade scrolls, heated weapons, chilled weapons, genetic medicines, a LuoWanXiang*, etc. In a phrase--the internet market is a place to spend money.*TL note: I have no idea what this is. Either I missed it in a previous chapter or the author will introduce the meaning of this in a future chapter.\"Fighter discussions\"Luo Feng clicked into the board and saw a thread named \"Basic fighter knowledge database\". In this thread, there were no replies; it was just a huge amount of basic data.\"Spirit reader, spirit reader.....\"Luo Feng kept scrolling through the page as he tried to find some sort of introduction on spirit readers, finally-\"Hm? It's this\"Luo Feng saw a section - \"A basic sketch on spirit readers\"\"Fellow brothers, since it seems to me that people know very little about spirit readers, let me give a basic introduction\" After Luo Feng read this first sentence, he laughed. It was clear that this so called fighter database was just a bunch of posts from fighters put together; it wasn't formal at all.\"Spirit readers could be called the most feared group in the circle of fighters\"\"First, you can't train to become a spirit reader. Every spirit reader is naturally gifted and awaken by themselves!\" the language used in the post was quite casual, \"Before they awaken, the might just be a regular fighter. However, once they awaken..... then they'll be off the charts!\"\"Why are they off the charts?\"\"Well first, there are two types of spirit readers. One type has the power of telekinesis. In other words, they can control a needle or a blade and use them to conduct long ranged attacks! The objects controlled by their telekinesis is way more powerful than the bullets from a type heavy sniper rifle. The bullets from a sniper rifle are almost always straight. However, there are no rules to the objects that the spirit reader controls! Not only can they move freely, but their damage is also different\"\"For example, there are limits to the damage that the bullets of a machine gun or a type heavy sniper rifle can do. A top grade sniper rifle will have trouble killing a basic level commander. However, the power of a needle or blade that the spirit reader controls grows stronger with their spiritual force! There are many spirit readers that can kill horde leaders*\"*TL note: in case you forgot (last mentioned in vol 2 ch 10, but since I haven't been translating for a while that was quite a long time ago), the monsters have three different ranks: soldiers, commanders, and horde leaders.\"Other than the type that uses telekinesis, the second type directly uses their spiritual force to attack!\"\"This type is more mysterious. They directly attack the monster's soul, and once they succeed, the monster will die without a single wound on their body! However, attacking a soul is pretty hard, so I heard that spirit readers that know of the 'Spiritual attack' technique are extremely rare\"\"Other than the 'Telekinesis' and 'Spiritual attack' techniques, there are legendary spirit readers that know more techniques. It's just that I'm not too sure of those\"Luo Feng read word by word, not even missing a single point.\"However, the thing I'm most jealous of is the rate of growth of the spirit readers! Spirit readers naturally have a powerful spiritual force. It's just that when they are young, their bodies can't handle all of that spiritual force, so it sleeps within their subconsciousness. When their body gets stronger and stronger, until it reaches a certain level, the spiritual force will show itself!\"\"The stronger the body, the more spiritual force it can withstand!\"\"The fighter levels of warrior (beginner, intermediate, advanced), warlord (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and wargod (beginner, intermediate, advanced), nine different levels in all! Body fitness level usually has a difference of two levels compared to spiritual force. For example, if someone's fitness level is at the level of a beginner warrior, then that spirit reader would usually be an advanced warrior! If their body was at the level of an intermediate warrior, then that spirit reader would be a beginner warlord......\"\"Spirit readers have extremely rapid growth periods!\"\"Since a spirit reader naturally has a very powerful spiritual force, it just sleeps in their subconsciousness! Whenever their body gets stronger, the sleeping spiritual force will show more of itself..... the stronger the body, the stronger the spiritual force..... until one day, when all of the sleeping spiritual force has showed itself. After that happens, the growth rate of a spirit reader will start to slow down\"When Luo Feng read this part, he couldn't help but to hesitate.So.....When a spirit reader gets stronger, it actually just means that the sleeping spiritual force is showing itself. Only with a strong body can you withstand enough spiritual force!\"So a spirit reader's potential depends on how much spiritual force they have within them\"\"Sometimes the sleeping spiritual force takes the shape of a liquid substance or a half solid, half liquid substance. Sometimes they're even completely solid!\"\"According to legend, if the spiritual force takes the shape of a solid, then the spiritual force is extremely great! They're the ones with the most potential out of all the spirit readers. As their body grows, the spiritual force in the solid will continuously release, which makes them even stronger\"\"Until one day, when the solid completely dissolves, will their rapid growth period end!\"Luo Feng suppressed his excitement and continued reading until he finished the entire thing.After that, Luo Feng continued to search the database and managed to find two more introductions on spirit readers.\"What they outlined were pretty much the same, so it looks like they're true\" Luo Feng nodded, \"then..... the dark, golden ball in my consciousness should be a large amount of spiritual force in the form of a solid! I'm sure lucky to have survived my awakening\"Luo Feng was amazed.According to what he read in the three posts' introductions, when a spirit reader awakens, a huge amount of powerful spiritual force explodes in their subconsciousness. If their awakening fails, then they might become retarded, a vegetable human, or even die of blood loss!\"No wonder I had a slight headache almost every day of my childhood. I even had a few comas\" Luo Feng realized, \"It looks like that was because my body was too weak and couldn't handle my powerful spiritual force, which caused the headaches! Now that my fitness level has rose, the headaches became less frequent. Now, my headaches are completely nonexistent\"Ever since Luo Feng awakened, his headaches disappeared.\"I can't believe that dark, golden ball was the form my spiritual force is taking\"\"I wonder how much spiritual force is inside that\" wondered Luo Feng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Reading these allowed Luo Feng to learn a lot, and also understand the hardships of a fighter! Fighters may have high positions in society, but they put their lives on the line for it!\"Yes, these posts sure have a point\"\"Technique, attacks, and Dao Yin techniques. These three major scrolls are the most important to fighters! The Dao Yin techniques determine how much their strength rises while techniques and attacks determine their combat strength\" Luo Feng read the post and agreed. These three scrolls are indeed the most important to a fighter.If you have money, you should throw them at these three scrolls!\"No wonder the Dojo of Limits allowed me to have these three scrolls for free\" Luo Feng knew that the Dojo of Limits obviously wanted their own fighters to become stronger.\"Let's go in the internet market and see what's there\"luo Feng tapped the touch screen of the wireless keyboard and entered the webpage of the internet market board.Suddenly--All sorts of specific classifications for goods appeared on the large screen on the wall of the video room. Luo Feng picked 'scroll'--after pressing 'attack type' three times, the screen suddenly showed photos of the scrolls, their names, and their prices.\ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdType: Spear. Rating: Legendary. Price: 100 billion Chinese dollars (full price), 50 billion Chinese dollars (half price requirement: 4 star contribution rank)\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdType: Blade.

Price: 3 billion Chinese dollars (full price), 1.5 billion Chinese dollars (half price requirement: 3 star contribution rank)............When Luo Feng saw the large list of scrolls, his eyes widened.\"Holy shit, they even sell the world's strongest fighter's ('Hong) spear technique\ufffd\ufffdDestroyer \ufffd\ufffd?And this\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd is the technique of the second strongest fighter 'Thunder Lord'?\"Luo Feng was immediately attracted to the very top of the page, where the spear and blade techniques were rated legendary. However, the price of them left him wide-eyed.They all cost 100 billion?And a half price of 50 billion requires a contribution rank of 4 stars?\"A 4 star contribution rank, doesn't that mean 100 million contribution points?\" Luo Feng was very clear on the different contribution ranks.10 thousand contribution points represents 1 star.100 thousand contribution points represents 2 stars.1,000 thousand contribution points represents 3 stars.10,000 thousand contribution points represents 4 stars.Once you reach 50,000 thousand contribution points, you reach the legendary 5 star rank! To reach the 5 star rank is virtually impossible; the difficulty is way too high.*TL note: Yes I know 1,000 thousand is a million but I thought it would be nice to easily see the increments of 10 like the original version.\"\ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdthe name of the world's strongest attack technique\" Luo Feng pressed \ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffd, and was curious about the overall introduction for the \ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdsince this is the world's strongest spear attack, most of the fighters that see this scroll would want to see an overview.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng stared.There were even more prices inside the webpage for the \"Destroyer\" scroll.\ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffdAll six levels--Price: 100 billion Chinese dollars (full price), 50 billion Chinese dollars (half price requirement: 4 star contribution rank)\ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffdFirst five levels--Price: 40 billion Chinese Dollars (full price), 20 billion Chinese dollars (half price requirement: 4 star contribution rank)\ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffdFIrst four levels--Price: 15 billion Chinese dollars (full price), 7.5 billion Chinese dollars (half price requirement: 3 star contribution rank)......\ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffdFirst level--Price: 200 million Chinese dollars (full price), 100 million Chinese dollars (half price requirement: 1 star contribution rank)\"What? You can even buy this scroll in parts?\" Luo Feng thought for a bit. Indeed, for an ultimate spear technique like the \ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffd, who could afford the entire thing? That price is practically sky high! And even if someone does buy it, they have to start from the first level. And how many fighters can actually train to the sixth level?Probably most fighters will be stuck on the first level for their entire lives; they'll never be able to start training on the second level.\"This ultimate scroll... no wonder it's the strongest fighter's attack technique\" Luo Feng stared at the introduction, \"I can't believe this spear technique is actually a package. If you buy this scroll, you basically buy both a technique scroll and an attack scroll\" Luo Feng was envious.Sadly, he trains with a blade.And he couldn't afford a price like that in the first place.\"\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdlike the \ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffd, is also an ultimate scroll\" Luo Feng immediately opened the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd's website\ufffd\ufffdIf we say Luo Feng looked at the \ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffdscroll for the sake of curiosity\ufffd\ufffdthen he'll be looking at the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd with expectation and desire!\"Nine Stage Thunder Blade\", this is the scroll that a blade wielding fighter would want the most!\"Hm?\" Luo Feng looked at the description.The description says that the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdis the hardest blade technique to learn on earth\ufffd\ufffdeven though it's called a blade technique, it also incorporates agility and a unique Dao Yin technique! So the reason why the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdis hard to learn is because it requires too much strength, reflex, etc. from your body.\"A blade technique also has agility and a Dao Yin technique?\" Luo Feng was overjoyed.If the price isn't absurd, then he can buy it!Luo Feng looked closely at the price -\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdAll nine stages--Price: 100 billion Chinese dollars (full price), 50 billion Chinese dollars (half price requirement: four star contribution rank)\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdFirst eight stages--Price: 50 billion Chinese dollars (full price), 25 billion Chinese Dollars (half price requirement: four star contribution rank)......\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdFirst five stages--Price: 2 billion Chinese dollars (full price), 1 billion Chinese dollars (half price requirement: 3 star contribution rank)\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdFirst four stages--Price: 500 million Chinese dollars (full price), 250 million Chinese dollars (half price requirement: two star contribution rank)\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdFirst three stages--Price: 200 million Chinese dollars (full price), 100 million Chinese dollars (half price requirement: two star contribution rank)\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdFirst two stages--Price: 100 million Chinese dollars (full price), 50 million Chinese dollars (half price requirement: two star contribution rank)\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdFirst stage--Price: 50 million Chinese dollars (full price), 25 million Chinese dollars (half price requirement: two star contribution rank)WHen Luo Feng saw these prices, it was clear that the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdhad a full nine stages and it's price was a bit cheaper than the \ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffd's.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng raised his eyebrow. At the bottom of the website there was an alert written in red letters--'\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdis an ultimate blade technique and is extremely hard to learn and begin. There are tons of fighters all over the planet who have tried to learn this technique but couldn't even get into the first stage. When picking this technique, please be careful!'When Luo Feng saw this alert, he hesitated.Apparently this technique is very hard to learn. However, if you manage to successfully learn it, then it's power is immensely high,Buy it or not?Since this is not a small number at all!......In the dim video room, the large screen was displaying the introduction of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdwhile Luo Feng silently sat on the couch as he contemplated. If he really was going to buy the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, then it wouldn't be a small number at all! The amount of money he would spent would be sky high for even a fighter.\"If I'm going to train, then I'm going to train in the best one!\" Luo Feng clenched his teeth and his eyes flashed, \"I don't believe that I won't be able to learn this!\"Ever since he was little, Luo Feng has always been seriously training bitterly.\"I'm a spirit reader and my hidden spiritual force in my subconsciousness has taken the form of a dark, golden ball! My strength will surely have a period of rapid growth. I just don't believe that I won't be able to successfully learn the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd\" Luo Feng has always had a belief, which is the belief that the Dojo of Limits instructors teach their students--Pursue your limits, surpass your limits!There was also another saying--'A fighter that doesn't want to become the world's strongest fighter, isn't a qualified fighter!'\"\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdI know I can successfully learn it\" Luo Feng took a deep breath and lightly tapped the display.\"Please confirm whether or not you want to purchase the first three stages of the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, you need to pay 100 million Chinese dollars!\" An alert appeared on the large screen. Since it's Luo Feng's first purchase, according to the his contract with the Dojo of Limits, he can ignore the contribution rank requirement for the half price deal.\"Confirm!\" Luo Feng tapped it.\"Please confirm your identity via fingerprint to confirm again\" a reminder appeared on the screen.Luo Feng put his finger on the wireless keyboard's fingerprint scanner.[BEEP!]\"Identity confirmed\"\"Purchase successful!\"\"Discount successful!\"\"The first three stages of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdwill arrive at Mr. Luo Feng's home within 24 hours\" consecutive notices appeared on the screen.TL note: I kept changing the scroll names because I kept forgetting what I should put for them (so in this chapter, I said technique, attack, and Dao Yin technique). From now on, instead of technique, I'm just going to say agility (attack and Dao Yin technique will remain the same).

It couldn't be helped; this was 100 million Chinese dollars! Buying Zhang Hao Bai's line of villas would be easy.Furthermore, Luo Feng's family was always poor. One could imagine how he felt to use 100 million all up at once!\"Thankfully this isn't my money\" Luo Feng grinned.The scroll purchasing was a success. Next.... buying weapons, battle uniform, etc.\"I have a principal of 20 million. I'll try to save where I can\" Luo Feng opened the list of weapons and quickly found the 2nd series 'Ghost Blade'.Ghost blade 2nd series, Model A1--Price: 100 thousand Chinese dollars (full price), 50 thousand Chinese dollars (half price requirement: 1 star contribution rank)Ghost blade 2nd series, Model A2--Price: 500 thousand Chinese dollars (full price), 250 thousand Chinese dollars (half price requirement: 1 star contribution rank)..................2nd series, Model A5--Price: 6 million Chinese dollars (full price), 3 million Chinese dollars (half price requirement: 1 star contribution rank)......Luo Feng looked carefully at the models' descriptions and couldn't help but to frown, \"My strength rises at a rapid rate now. I'm sure that my body fitness level will rise to the border of an advanced level warrior soon. Since I'm buying a weapon, I should try to buy a good one\"If it was a regular intermediate level warrior...He can just purchase either the A2 or A3 model. You only have to donate 10 thousand dollars to get one contribution point!The so called one contribution point is to differentiate between the fighters from your own Dojo and those from outside. The Dojo of Limits owns an internal network--Home of Limits' 'Internet Market', but they also have an actual fighter market. Fighters outside of the dojo can buy their goods too, but they must pay the full price!\"With my rate of growth, I'll have to buy at least an A5 or A6 model ghost blade\" nodded Luo Feng, \"But these models require a one star contribution rank!\"\"A one star rank is 10 thousand contribution points!\"His first purchase ignored the contribution rank restriction and he managed to buy the scroll with the best price. However, this kind of offer only lasted for his first scroll purchase.His weapons, battle uniform, etc. won't have these kinds ofdeals at all.\"Ghost blade model A6's full price is 20 million. Model A5's full price is 6 million\" Luo Feng shook his head. The A5 model can fight most of the 'medium-level commander' monsters without worrying about the weapon breaking. The A6 model weapon can fight most of the 'high-level commander' monsters without worrying about the weapon breaking.With his current rate of growth, an earlier model weapon is clearly not suitable.\"Buy them at full price? Too expensive\" Luo Feng shook his head.\"Let's check the shields\"Luo Feng opened up the webpage for the shields and as he looked closely, he noticed that the price of the shields were way lower than the blades'. A B5 model that can block a 'medium level commander' costs 3 million Chinese dollars at full price and 1.5 million Chinese dollars at half price. However, the contribution rank requirement is also 1 star!\"Bag\"When living in the wilderness and fighting with monsters, the type of bag you carry with you is also special. First, the bag itself needs to be high quality, and it shouldn't hinder the fighter's movements when he fights with monsters.\"The cheapest bag requires only one contribution point. A better one is only 10 thousand dollars\" Luo Feng let out a smile.\"A tactical communications watch has time, GPS, a phone, and many more functions. The price is not bad too, only 10 thousand dollars\" In reality, those functions aren't worth that much money. In the market nowadays, the phones that cost a few hundred dollars can also make calls, show time, and have a GPS system built into them. The only reason it costs 10 thousand dollars is because the material it's made out of is expensive!When fighting with a monster, their claws might touch the watch! The watch has to be sturdy enough to withstand a monster's attack, so how could it be cheap?\"I already checked out the blade, shield, watch, and bag. Now there's only one thing left.... the battle uniform including the boots\" Luo Feng already heard that the battle uniform is the most expensive gear on the fighter! Because not only does the defense have to be good, but it also has to be comfortable and not get in the way of the fighter's dodging.Luo Feng opened it to see.....\"Holy!\"\"So expensive!\"Luo Feng was dumbfounded, \"Even though it's a D5 edition battle uniform that includes bracers and boots as a set and can deflect a medium-level commander, the full price is 18 million Chinese dollars, and the half price is 9 million. The D6 requires 80 million Chinese dollars for the full price. \"I knew that the battle uniforms were expensive, but I didn't know that the 5th series battle uniform is three times more expensive than the blade of the same series!Now for the calculations.....If we use the 5th series for all of them--The entire battle uniform set is 18 million, the ghost blade is 6 million, the shield is 3 million, so 27 million total! If he had a one star contribution rank, then he would only need 13.5 million.The prices tactical communications watch and the bag are nothing compared to the battle uniform's!\"I still want to buy some throwing knives that I could control with my spiritual force! I should buy at least six or ten of them\" Luo Feng opened the throwing knives page. Throwing knives are just some small items. They are small in size and low in weight, so naturally they should be way cheaper than the ghost blade.A 5th series throwing knife is only 50 thousand Chinese dollars for the full price.6th series, 300 thousand Chinese dollars for the full price.7th series, the full price is an astounding 3 million Chinese dollars, and half price is 1.5 million (requirement: 2 star contribution rank), a full 10x increase! If you put enough strength behind it, a 7th series throwing knife can easily harm a low-level horde leader monster. The difference between a commander and a horde leader is huge, but who knew that the weapon's prices will have such a huge difference too.\"My spiritual force is powerful and it'll continue to grow rapidly. I was planning on buying a 7th series throwing knife, but one knife is 3 million, and the half price requirement is a 2 star contribution rank! If I buy 5 or 6, that's already more than 10 million!\"\"How can I afford this?\"\"This money, isn't even enough at all\" Luo Feng thought that a principal of twenty million dollars was plenty, but he realized that a fighter's equipment is absurdly expensive.What Luo Feng didn't know, was that the prices weren't absurd at all!A horde leader level monster can't even be killed by a guided missile! For a throwing knife to be able to pierce them, one could guess how high the quality of the knife must be! One knife for 3 million is reasonable.......When fighters spend money to buy their equipment, they have to spend a lot. However, they also earn a ton of money when hunting monsters.Sadly, Luo Feng hasn't started making money yet.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdAt around 10 AM on the second day.Ming-Yue sector, a stranger came to Luo Feng's villa's garden.\"Mr. Luo Feng, here is the scroll you purchased. Your fingerprint will be able to open it\"Luo Feng accepted the sent sealed alloyed box and slid his finger across the top of the alloyed box, \"[BEEP!] Fingerprint test passed\" a metallic sound arose and the alloyed box opened up. A book that was around one cm thick was inside. There were also two discs on the book.\"Nine stage Thunder Blade\" Luo Feng saw the four words on the book.\"Mr. Luo Feng, try opening it. After confirming, please sign\" said the delivery boy as he smiled, but there was a bit of admiration in his eye as he looked towards Luo Feng.Nine stage Thunder Blade!The average fighter couldn't afford this.\"Mr. Luo Feng, I'm sure you're aware of the taboos that come with your purchase?\" the delivery boy smiled, \"According to the rules, I'll say them..... The ownership of the scroll goes to the creator of the scroll, \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdis copyrighted by Thunder God\ufffd\ufffdPeople who have purchased it only have the right to learn it, but not the right to teach it. You are not allowed to copy it and sell it or teach it privately. If someone breaks the rule, the Dojo of Limits, the Thunder Dojo, the Underground Alliance, and the government will work together to hunt them down!\"Luo Feng nodded, of course he knew this rule.After confirming, the delivery boy left.\"Just this one scroll and two discs is worth 100 million Chinese dollars\" Luo Feng stood in his garden and was amazed, \"Seems like making a scroll makes the most money. For example, if more people buy Thunder God's \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdthen he earns more money.\" After calculating for a bit, it's not hard to find out how much money Thunder God makes.However.... for Thunder God, the creator of the 'Thunder Dojo', money probably doesn't mean much to him.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdRight when Luo Feng was about to enter his home with his scroll, \"Luo Feng\" a voice arose.Luo Feng turned his head, and the person who came to visit was the Dojo of Limits' chief instructor 'Wu Tong'.\"Uncle Wu\" Luo Feng laughed.\"I just saw the delivery guy at headquarters, you buy something?\" Wu Tong laughed.\"Yes\" Luo Feng nodded.\"\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd?\" Wu Tong looked at the four words on the scroll in Luo Feng's hands and was shocked, \"You, you actually could afford this?\" Scrolls were strictly controlled by all the large powers on earth.\"The money I spent wasn't my money anyway\" Luo Feng laughed and randomly said, \"However, I found out that I really don't have enough money to spend. Blades, battle uniforms, etc. require so much money\"\"Oh yea, Luo Feng, I came here to tell you something\" chief instructor 'Wu Tong' laughed as he said, \"Not too long ago, wasn't there a young man named Zhang Hao Bai who offended you?\"Luo Feng was startled, Zhang Hao Bai? Luo Feng didn't even have a chance to get back at him yet.\"Yea, he got someone to try and break my arms and legs in the past\" nodded Luo Feng.\"Well it's like this. Zhang Hao Bai's uncle, 'Zhang Ze Hu', is a fighter from the Thunder Dojo. He asked the chief instructor of the Thunder Dojo here in Yang Zhou city to help resolve this. He wants to resolve this matter privately with you\" chief instructor 'Wu Tong' laughed, \"Luo Feng, aren't you low in money? This is a big chance to earn money, you could take advantage of this opportunity to earn a ton!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For example, in China, fighters in the six major headquarters are under the government's control and are subject to law! However, once they leave the city and enter the monsters' area, there was no law to resolve anything.That was a place where fighters and monsters fight, a place with no laws! The fighters all walked on the border between life and death, so cases where fighters kill each other over their conflicts are common.All the large dojos, the government, etc. don't want to see this kind of thing happen.Fighters, are the wealth of humans!They're the only thing they have that can fight against monsters; they don't want the fighters to have any internal feuds. So from this came the 'Internal Negotiations' which 'settled' the arguments. People have grudges, okay, let's settle them at the table to end them. It's another saying if there is absolutely no way to resolve them.\"Luo Feng, you're still a rookie that just entered the circle of fighters. It's best to not make any enemies\" smiled chief instructor Wu Tong as he said, \"You also need money right when you start\"\"Okay\"Luo Feng nodded. If they can resolve it, then so be it, \"Uncle Wu, I can't let Zhang Hao Bai off easily! If I was weak, then my legs and arms would've been broken\"\"But of course\" nodded Wu Tong as he said, \"if we don't let them bleed, they might think my Dojo of Limits is afraid of them\"\"Uncle Wu, what price do you think I should offer?\" asked Luo Feng. He didn't know the rules, so he thought it would be better to get some advice.After pondering, Wu Tong said, \"If it was just a regular person who messed with you, then you shouldn't go past 50 million Chinese dollars! And Luo Feng, you are an elite of our Dojo of Limits, so you shouldn't go too low either. No lower than 10 million Chinese dollars! Between 10 to 50 million, you can just randomly pick a number\"\"Okay\" Luo Feng nodded his head as he considered his choices.\"If you agree, then I'll tell them to come over tonight to meet us\" laughed Wu Tong.\"Okay, thanks uncle Wu\" laughed Luo Feng as he nodded.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdLuo Feng first returned home to put his \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdscroll away\ufffd\ufffdand then entered the internal network 'Home of Limits' to try and find some information on private negotiations between fighters.\"Oh..... so it's like this\"\"Reputation also ties in with this payment money\"Luo Feng consecutively read many posts and finally felt that he had an idea about what tonight's negotiations would be like.\"Feng, it's time to eat\" mother Gong Xin Lan's voice came from downstairs.\"Coming, mom\"Luo Feng turned off the power and then headed downstairs.In the living room downstairs, his father and mother were carrying the plates and bowls around while the maid cooked.\"Where's Luo Hua?\" asked Luo Feng doubtfully, \"he still hasn't returned?\". Right now, there are two hired maids, both around 40 years old. One of them was hired just to take care of Luo Hua, since it would be more convenient for Luo Feng: with someone looking over his brother, he can go outside more.\"Your brother is at the lotus flower lake park, he just called to tell us he'll be here soon\" said father Luo Hong Guo as he smiled.\"How come brother has been going to that park all the time these days?\" asked Luo Feng.Mother Gong Xin Lan laughed softly on the side: \"Feng, your brother has a girlfriend\"\"Girlfriend?\" Luo Feng was surprised. Even though there were many handicapped people in society these days, for example the soldiers who fought in the army and came back crippled from fighting monsters...... although handicapped people can also get into relationships, marry, and have children, but Luo Hua hasn't even been here for over a month yet.In such a short time, in a relationship?\"Feng, don't listen to your mother. Your brother is spending time with a girl, but they aren't at that point yet\" laughed Luo Hong Guo.\"Who cares, it's good if he can get into a relationship\" Luo Feng was happy inside. No matter what the result of this relationship is, it's an experience of life. This experience is good for him.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdYang Zhou city's Yi-An* region, sky garden sector.*TL note: If any of you actually still remember from vol. 1 ch. 14~15, I wrongfully wrote Zhi-An sector for the location of the sky garden sector (it's supposed to be Yi-An. sorry about that)\"Uncle\" Zhang Hao Bai looked at his uncle Zhang Ze Hu. Zhang Hao Bai went through these recent days in a state of fear and nervousness. He was even afraid that someone from the security agency will come and snatch him away.\"Hu, as long as we can keep Hao Bai, it's ok if we go through some pain\" Zhang Ze Long couldn't help but to say.\"Bro, rest assured!\" Zhang Ze Hu was very large and muscular and he gave off a feeling of an unrivaled, ferocious beast. Zhang Ze Hu grinned and showed his snow white teeth, \"That little rabbit Luo Feng, just a rookie fighter! All he did was fight the weakest monsters raised by the military to become a fighter, he should know the rules! Those who shouldn't have caused trouble, actually caused trouble..... hmph, messing with the Mountain Tiger* is asking for death!\"*TL note: This is basically his nickname which will be mentioned again later.Seeing how his uncle was so confident, Zhang Ze Long and Zhang Hao Bai let out a sigh of relief.\"Alright, leave it to me, I'll be going\"After waving, Zhang Ze Hu headed out.Outside was a heavy, six-wheeled, remodeled hummer. There was even someone inside waving out and smiling as he shouted: \"Brother Hu, ready?\"\"Yup, go and pick up old Li and then we'll head to the Dojo of Limits\" Zhang Ze Hu got on the car and waved as he said.\"ALRIGHT!\"The hummer let out a low, powerful noise and swiftly left the sky garden sector.Around evening, in Yang Zhou city's Ming-Yue sector's Limit Hall's 2nd floor's lobby, Luo Feng and his group were there.\"Feng, what a coincidence. Your uncle Kong and big brother Chen are here\" laughed Wu Tong loudly. Luo Feng also greeted the two people beside Wu Tong. One of them seemed extremely skinny and had a scar on his face that looked like it cut his face in half. Just looking at him strikes fear in you.The other man was a burly man who you could tell was enthusiastic just by looking at him.\"Brother Chen, uncle Kong\" yelled Luo Feng.These two people weren't ordinary people. In the Limit Hall here in Yang-Zhou city, there were three warlord level fighters: Chief Instructor Wu Tong, 'Fire Cannon' Chen Gu, and 'Hawk Blade' Kong Quan. Wu Tong already retired from monster hunting, while 'Fire Cannon' Chen Gu and 'Hawk Blade' Kong Quan frequently leave the city to hunt monsters.These two people were the leading figures in the circle of fighters in the Ming-Yue sector.\"Feng, we already know about the situation. Rest assured, we'll stick out for you in this case!\" laughed Fire Cannon Chen Gu, \"Damn, no matter how cocky these Thunder Dojo people get, they won't mess with us\"\"Yes\" Hawk Blade Kong Quan slightly nodded.After a moment -The people from the Dojo of Limits and the Thunder Dojo sat on their respective sides in the lobby. There were at least 20 people on the Dojo of Limits' side while there were just 8 people on the Thunder Dojo's.\"Wu Tong, in this case, it is indeed Hu's nephew's fault\" a large brute laughed loudly as he said, \"but that nephew is just a small child? What does he understand, and he's just an ordinary person, not even a fighter, so no need to argue over such trivial things\"\"Old Li, don't bring in those pointless things\" laughed Wu Tong as he shaked his head, \"No matter how uncertain we are about this case, you guys came here to negotiate right? Mountain Tiger, say something\"Zhang Ze Hu, who is called \"Mountain Tiger\" in the circle of fighters, uses a gigantic two handed machete*.*TL note: The first two characters for machete is \ufffd_\u027d and his nickname is \ufffd_\u027d\ufffd\ufffd. Since there's a character for mountain in it I just decided to call him Mountain Tiger (but now you see where his nickname comes from)\"Chief Instructor Wu\" smiled Zhang Ze Hu as his gaze landed upon Luo Feng, \"For this case, we should let little Luo explain it himself. Little Luo, how should we go about solving this case in a way that satisfies you?\"\"Shut up\"'Hawk Blade' Kong Quan snapped, \"Luo Feng is a good brother in our Dojo of Limits, Little Luo? He is qualified for you to call him by his name too\"Zhang Ze Hu panicked, Hawk Blade Kong Quan was a ruthless man in the circle of fighters, so even Zhang Ze Hu doesn't want to anger him.\"Mr. Zhang Ze Hu\" Luo Feng stood up and smiled, \"This case made many of my brothers stand up for me, so I'm a bit embarrassed. But for my own thoughts..... hmph, that Zhang Hao Bai trying to break my arms and legs is a small matter, but he actually attacked my dad, and that is asking death!\"Luo Feng shouted as he glared.Zhang Ze Hu was shocked and the fighters on the side of the Dojo of Limits laughed. This 'Mountain Tiger' Zhang Ze Hu was a senior fighter and is an advanced warrior, just one step away from the warlord level. Luo Feng actually dared to glare at him with such an attitude, which let the fighters on the side of the Dojo of Limits understand his courage!\"Hmph, Luo Feng, so what do you want to do? Speak!\" Zhang Ze Hu wasn't amused and had a bad face on.Zhang Ze Hu's anger? He really didn't care about it. Just speaking about the present, Luo Feng's body fitness level is already high for an intermediate warrior, so he's nearing the 'advanced warrior' level. And with his spiritual force added in there, he's already at least a 'beginner warlord' level.\"One phrase, 50 million Chinese dollars. I, Luo Feng, will give you some face, and we can call this case off\" smiled Luo Feng.\"You sure have a huge mouth, 50 million!\" glared Zhang Ze Hu.\"This price is high\" frowned the Thunder Dojo's chief instructor Li.Luo Feng just smiled and said nothing.\"The price isn't high\" smiled the Dojo of Limits' chief instructor Wu Tong.\"Luo Feng, I'll give you a price, 5 milion! I'll give you 5 million and we'll call off this case and it'll still leave me some face. Or else you aren't giving me, Zhang Ze Hu, any face!\" Zhang Ze Hu stared at Luo Feng.5 million?The people on the side of the Dojo of Limits frowned, even if you are trying to give some face to 'Fire Cannon' Chen Gu and 'Hawk Blade' Kong Quan, you shouldn't offer such a low price. If the price is too low, you aren't giving any face!\"Or else I'm not giving you any face?\" Luo Feng glared, \"Zhang Ze Hu, let me say something also. 50 million, no less. If you're even one dollar off, then prepare to meet your nephew in the security agency!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And in this kind of situation, technically, if two people are of equal position, the side that made the mistake should apologize.And yet Zhang Ze Hu was assertive, clearly taking advantage of Luo Feng's status of a rookie.However..... Luo Feng wasn't affected.\"Okay, listen to me\" the Dojo of Limits' chief instructor Wu Tong spoke, \"Luo Feng and Mountain Tiger, both of you back off. 30 million Chinese dollars! Zhang Ze Hu, 30 million isn't that much to you, bring out that amount and we'll call it off. Luo Feng, you don't have any objections right\"Luo Feng nodded: \"We'll do as uncle Wu says\"\"Mountain Tiger, you?\" Wu Tong looked towards Zhang Ze Hu.Everyone's gazes landed upon Zhang Ze Hu, and he angrily stood up and laughed as he said: \"Making me lower my head to a tiny rabbit? In your dreams! Lao Li, brothers, let's go!\"\"If you don't want to resolve this, then you'll have to pay 100 million to protect your nephew\" Wu Tong laughed softly.\"I'd rather give the country 100 million than to give 30 million to resolve this!!!\" Zhang Ze Hu looked coldly towards Luo Feng and mocked, \"Kiddo, being a fighter isn't that easy! After you leave the city you'll see how scary monsters are. All of the scariest situations come without warning. And the monsters in the military camp don't even come close at all. Those monsters are raised by the military and are the weakest type. I hope you don't die too quickly, or else how would you come back to play with me? Right, let me remind you, I'm not too far off from the warlord level. How long will it take for you to reach the warlord level? And, can you even survive for that long?\"Luo Feng laughed: \"Thank you Mr. Zhang Ze Hu for your care. However, you should think about how you're going to prepare 100 million to give to the country to protect your nephew\"\"Hmph\" Zhang Ze Hu's face sank, \"Let's go!\"\"One hundred million man, one hundred million\" Fire Cannon Chen Gu purposefully shouted twice in a weird voice.Zhang Ze Hu's group spoke no further and left.Seeing how that group left, the people from the Dojo of Limits started getting rowdy.\"This Zhang Ze Hu's temper is just as the rumors said: so bad it's indescribable. It's clearly his nephew's fault and he still refused to lower his head\" Wu Tong laughed as he shook his head, \"He would rather donate 100 million than pay 30 million to resolve it!\"The Dojo has contribution points, and the country has contribution points too!Those who have contributed to the country receive contribution points depending on what they have done. 10,000 points is the one star rank. 100,000 points is the two star rank..... which is the same as the Dojo of Limits' system. The year where one man, Dong Nan Bao, saved thousands of civilians by slaying the Tiger head dragon was given a four star hero medal.Just like how you can donate to the Dojo to earn contribution points, you can also donate to the country to earn contribution points.10 thousand Chinese dollars is one contribution point.100 million Chinese dollars is 10,000 contribution points, which is the one star rank!If Zhang Ze Hu doesn't want to negotiate with Luo Feng, then the only solution left is to donate 100 million to the country for his nephew and let his nephew get the 1 star rank. As a one star ranked civilian, Zhang Hao Bai is granted special rights. He can't go to jail for too long just because of the conflict between him and Luo Feng.\"Even if he gives the country 100 million to make his nephew a one star civilian, a one star civilian will still have to go to jail for 3 to 5 months for going against a fighter and suffer a bit!\" said Fire Cannon Chen Gu as he shook his head.\"If he doesn't want to lower his head, then who can we blame?\"\"Guess he doesn't care because he has money\"The fighters of the Dojo of Limits laughed loudly.\"Luo Feng\" chief instructor Wu Tong laughed, \"According to chief Zhu Ge's commands, we'll have to make arrangements for you to enter a warlord level fighter squad. This way you can train yourself more easily outside the city. It's also safer this way! I talked for you and made the preparations for you to enter the 'Fire hammer squad'\".\"Fire hammer squad?\" Luo Feng nodded.That chief Zhu Ge Tong really values him, from the start, he let him join a warlord level fighter squad.The squads that leave the cities and enter the wilderness to hunt monsters don't have an even skill level. Usually if a team consists of just one warlord level fighter, then that squad counts as a warlord level squad.\"Luo Feng\" Fire Cannon Chen Gu patted Luo Feng's shoulder and laughed loudly, \"I'm the vice captain of the fire hammer squad! I'll protect you when you're with me, but Luo Feng, I have to put out the ugly words first. Us members of the fire hammer squad will definitely give you chances to train so you can get used to hunting monsters, but you have to work hard too and can't just keep hoping for help from the other members. If you can't adapt after the first mission..... then we can only kick you out the squad\"\"Brother Chen, I understand\" Luo Feng laughed and nodded.A fighter squad lives on the border of life and death. If the squad has a burden, then the effect will be huge.\"If you understand then I can relax. Also.....\" Fire Cannon Chen Gu laughed as he said, \"Have you bought all of your weapons and equipment?\"\"Not yet, I'm preparing to buy some of the higher quality weapons and equipment. But for those, I need a one star contribution rank to buy them for half price\" Luo Feng shook his head hopelessly.Fire Cannon Chen Gu suddenly started laughing: \"This is simple. Tell me what you want to buy and I'll buy them for you! You don't have enough contribution points, but I do! I'm not far from the two star contribution rank right now. I can buy them all for half price and you can transfer the money to my account later right?\"\"Yes\" chief instructor Wu Tong nodded on the side, \"Equipment like cold or heated weapons can be bought by others without a problem. Of course, things like scrolls can't be bought by others for you\".Luo Feng nodded.This he knew, for example the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd that he bought will appear in the databases of the Dojo of Limits, Underground Alliance, the Thunder Dojo, etc. as--Luo Feng has purchased the first three stages of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd. That way, Luo Feng can use the Nine Stage Thunder Blade without a problem.However, if Yang Wu could use the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, then once he gets caught, he'll be arrested, since that counts as copying and spreading the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdscroll,which violates the rights Thunder God has for this scroll.If you don't buy it, you don't have the right to practice it!If you let someone else buy something for you, the database will display that. Since there isn't any information on you buying the scroll, you can't practice it even if you get it. However, weapons and equipment don't have this kind of copyright restriction.\"Luo Feng, write down all the weapons and equipment you need and I'll buy them for you when I get back\" said Chen Gu.\"Okay\"Luo Feng nodded and immediately went to write it down on a piece of paper.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdAll class 5 equipment, the battle uniform set's half price was 9 million, the 2nd series ghost blade's half price was 3 million, the 5th series shield was 1.5 million, and the ten 6th series throwing knives cost 1.5 million. For a grand total of 150 million. With his bag and tactical communications watch, Luo Feng was set.Luo Feng's home's 2nd floor in the training area.Dawn's light shone through the window which made the entire training area bright. Luo Feng was wearing a loose dojo uniform and kneeled on the floor. The training area was over 100 ping in size and was completely empty. It was just Luo Feng sitting in the middle, and in front of him was a scroll--\"Nine Stage Thunder Blade\"\ufffd\ufffd\"Seems like the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdis very difficult to learn, I wonder why\" Luo Feng opened the scroll and and looked at it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter turning to the first page of the \"Nine Stage Thunder Blade\" instruction manual*...*TL note: From now on, I'll change scrolls to instruction manuals.\"Speed!\" was the largest and most prominent word on the page. As if facing an approaching blade, Luo Feng's heart skipped a beat. This instruction manual is just a copy of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, but the copied handwriting was enough to freeze Luo Feng.One can imagine how horrifying the instruction manual's creator, Thunder Lord, is.Luo Feng continued reading.\"In all of martial arts, the only indestructible thing is speed\"\"As your blade gets faster and approaches the limit, you'll be invincible\" Luo Feng flipped to the title page and saw flamboyant handwriting, \"it's the same with \"Hong\" 's \ufffd\ufffdDestroyer\ufffd\ufffd, his most powerful move also approaches the limits of speed. In just one move, the sky shakes and the earth shatters, leaving nothing behind\"\"There is only one secret behind the \"Nine Stage Thunder Blade\" I have created: speed!\"Luo Feng flipped to the second page.\"How can speed have so much destructive force?\"\"First, if your blade can move faster than your opponent can react, you can slit their throat before they even raise their blade! Even if your strength is only a tenth of your opponent's, their throat cannot defend against your sharp blade. So speed allows you to attack your opponent's weak points\"\"Next, speed can increase the power of your blade\"\"Using the energy calculation formulas--a blade's attack power is equal to 0.5mv^2, in other words, in stable conditions, the faster the blade moves, the more energy it'll contain! Even a water column can pierce steel if fast enough. A piece of paper can cut steel!\"Speed, can let you slip through your opponent's defense!\"\"Speed, can make your blade indestructible! Whether you look at it from the angle of striking weak points, or the angle of increasing destructive power, the best way is to increase your blade's speed!\"Luo Feng nodded as he read. Most of the fighters in today's society will understand this point. Only by increasing your speed to the extreme can you become the strongest!\"Many fighters understand this point, but those who are able to put this to practice are few within few!\" The words Thunder Lord wrote in the instruction manual were full of confidence, \"The \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdI have created gives me the fastest blade on earth! It also gives me the highest speed and the strongest body!\"Luo Feng's eyes flashed as he read.\"The \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd incorporates the agility technique 'Liu Guang*', the entire Dao Yin technique set 'Nine Stage Hun Yuan', and the entire blade technique set 'Thunder Blade'. Out of these three, the Dao Yin technique is essential!\"*TL Note: Literally means flowing light.\"Only with the Dao Yin technique can you achieve a more powerful body!\"\"Body fitness is the core!\"\"Blade technique and agility need continuous practice and understanding!\"Luo Feng kept flipping through. There were three volumes on the Dao Yin technique in this instruction manual. According to the instruction manual's description, there were nine volumes of the 'Nine Stage Hun Yuan\" Dao Yin technique. This instruction manual also only had the first three volumes of the blade technique and the agility technique. Luo Feng read the entire thing word for word.After raising his head.....The sunlight was sinister and the August sun shone through the windows, causing the entire training hall to dazzle even more.\"Amazing, just amazing\"Luo Feng was completely sucked into the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdthat Thunder Lord had created. Even though he only has the first three stages, they were enough to make Luo Feng's jaw drop. Comparing the tips on the internet with this instruction manual was like comparing a firefly to the sun.\"I'll test this technique\"Luo Feng solemnly put the instruction manual in the corner of the training hall and took out his ghost blade. The ghost blade made a \"CHI\" sound as it was unsheathed. The entire ghost blade was 101 cm long, the blade itself was 78 cm long, and the blade's width was 5.2 cm. This blade was sharpened a while ago, and its main material was second grade Ke-Luo alloy.Even at half price, this blade costs 3 million, and weighed 112 kg.\"Start!\"[HU!] [HU!] Luo Feng seemed to just stand still in the middle of the training hall, but the ghost blade in his hand continuously waved around.The Nine Stage Thunder Blade technique relies on a special way to exert force.When a regular person swings their blade, you could say they use 100% of their strength! But in the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdtraining, only 70% of their strength is used in a swing. After unleashing the first stage of their attack, they'll force themselves to unleash another stage, also at 70% of their strength. Two of these stages added together equals 140% strength!The Nine Stage Thunder Blade has nine stages.In the first stage, you can unleash another stage, which is 140% of the power!In the second stage, you can unleash two more stages, which is 210% of the power!In the third stage, you can unleash three more stages, which is 280% of the power!......In the ninth stage, you can unleash nine more stages, which is 720% of the power! Which is seven times your regular strength.What does this represent?It means that if a beginner warrior is able to learn up to the ninth stage of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdthen he can basically rival a beginner warlord!\"So difficult, just like the rumors said. This \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdtraining is extremely difficult. Even the introductory part is so hard\" Luo Feng continued to swing his blade hundreds of times. With each swing, he tries to build upon the basics of swinging and unleash the second stage of his swing. However, he's unable to do it.Too difficult!A swing of a blade ends in just a moment. In this moment, after the first time you use your strength to swing, you have to exert your force again, which is practically impossible.\"Looks like I can't be too greedy. In the first stage of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, there are 18 different blade techniques. According to the instruction manual, if I practice these 18 techniques, I'll be able to realize the trick to unleashing the first stage of the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd\" nodded Luo Feng, There's a saying that goes \"After reading a book a hundred times, the meaning will show itself\".After practicing these 18 techniques many times, the meaning behind them will show itself.\"Feng, time to eat\"\"Feng, hurry\"Mom and Dad's voices carried from downstairs.\"Coming\" Luo Feng put his ghost blade back into its scabbard and hung it onto the wall. After that, he put the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdinstruction manual into his personal room. It was only after doing this did Luo Feng go downstairs to eat.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdTime passed, and even though Luo Feng already joined the Fire Hammer squad, they were on break. Luo Feng used this opportunity to polish his\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdtechnique, agility, and Dao-Yin technique. That and the genetic energy training produced clear results. Luo Feng's fitness level clearly grew by a ton again.And for the \"Nine Stage Thunder Blade\" technique, Luo Feng still hasn't been able to learn the first stage.Even though he couldn't learn it, it was clear that Luo Feng has become more agile, and his control over his blade and power has improved a lot.\"Even though I still can't unleash another stage, but at least I'm able to control my muscles much better than before\" Luo Feng stood alone in the training hall, and silently started putting on his battle uniform. He put five throwing knives on each of his thigh pockets, and he wore alloyed battle boots.He also had a vest on, which revealed his shoulders, and had wrist guards on both arms.He had his backpack, hexagonal shield, and ghost blade on his back. On his right wrist guard was his tactical communications watch. In his bag, he had some water and high carb food prepared.\"Today, August 28th, is the first day I leave the city and officially begin a mission\" Luo Feng took a deep breath,Indeed...Today, was the day that the Fire Hammer squad departs!\"Luo Feng!\" Fire Cannon Chen Gu's yell came from outside.\"Coming\" responded Luo Feng. He immediately ran downstairs and saw that his father Luo Hong Guo and mother Gong Xin Lan were standing in the living room. His brother Luo Hua was in his wheelchair and also silently looking at Luo Feng. They knew that today was the day that Luo Feng was going to leave the city and enter the wilderness.The wilderness was what people called the land outside of the city, which includes ruined cities, suburbs, mountains, forests, lakes, etc.\"Luo Feng, be careful\" Gong Xin Lan couldn't help but to say.\"Don't worry mom\" Luo Feng laughed. He nodded at his father and then finally looked towards Luo Hua.\"Bro, maybe when you come back, you'll be able to eat my wedding candy\" Luo Hua suddenly started laughing.\"Wedding candy? So fast? You haven't even known that young woman for two months yet\" laughed Luo Feng.\"If we're in a good relationship, who cares if it's quick?\" Luo Hua laughed.\"Alright, I'll come back to eat your wedding candy, so you better get a lot of good tasting ones for me\" Luo Feng laughed and rubbed his brother's head, \"Okay. Dad, mom, I'm off. I'll be back in a few days\". After saying that, Luo Feng ran towards the door and met with Chen Gu at the door of his villa.Luo Feng's family silently watched Luo Feng in his battle uniform leave swiftly with the brute, who was also fully equipped.\"Let's go, Luo Feng, to the HR alliance's market to meet up with the leader and the others. Then we'll leave together towards the wilderness\"\"Yes, Brother Chen\"Luo Feng swiftly headed towards the Dojo of Limit's private car with Chen Gu and another man with a steel spear on his back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the wall of the skyscraper were two very flashy english characters: 'HR'. Around the first floor of the skyscraper, there was a beautiful plaza which had the largest fountain in the city. Around the plaza, there were at least a thousand soldiers patrolling with real guns, preventing any outsider from stepping even one step inside.Every pedestrian who passes by looks at the skyscraper in admiration.Most of the people in the entire city have never entered the area.[BEEP!]An electronic sound rang.Within a moment, the patrolling soldiers immediately made way for a military SUV with 'HR' on the car body. It stopped in front of the gate of the lobby, HUA, the door opened, and three fully armed fighters came out, either carrying a spear, a blade and a hexagonal shield, or two metal boxes on their backs.\"Mister, please enter\" the doorman of the lobby's entrance greeted them respectfully.The three fighters immediately entered the skyscraper's lobby.\"Let's go, Luo Feng, let's go sit at the bar at the side and wait for the captain and the others to come\" Chen Gu laughed.\"I still haven't seen the captain yet. I wonder what he looks like\" laughed Luo Feng. At the same time, he observed the HR alliance market. This was the underground alliance that was built by the power families and corporations all around the world. It acted as their headquarters in Jiang-Nan city, so this skyscraper was extremely extravagant.The lobby was full of eccentric people, even their simple accessories were out of the ordinary.The waiter in the lobby, the handsome men and the beautiful women, each of them had a refreshing smile.Luo Feng, Chen Gu, and the other member 'Zhang Ke' all sat on the sofa.\"What will you three be having?\" smiled the waiter as he bowed while asking.\"Tie Guan Yin\"!\"Pu'Er tea, with a hint of Jasmine!\"Fire Cannon Chen Gu and Zhang Ke, these two senior fighters spoke immediately, which shocked Luo Feng a bit. In the Limit Hall, these two drank alcohol frequently. Zhang Ke, whose biceps were bulging like a gorilla's, laughed as he said: \"Luo Feng, the wilderness is dangerous, so we can't drink alcohol\"Luo Feng suddenly came to, yes, you can't take the wilderness lightly, how could you drink alcohol now?\"I'll also have a cup of Pu'Er tea\" laughed Luo Feng.A solemn, musical song was playing in the lobby. It was a piece played by a flute. As to what song it was, he couldn't tell. However, the song was soothing, yet energizing. It made one feel much more refreshed.\"Luo Feng, the first floor is the resting area for guests. From the second floor and up, it's where items are sold\" Chen Gu smiled, \"In the underground alliance, the prices are lower than the full price of the things in the 'Limit Home's internet market. Of course, it costs more than our half price\"Luo Feng nodded, half price was something that only the members of the Dojo could enjoy.\"The best thing about the underground alliance marketplace is..... that we can sell the ingredients we obtain from the monsters for a high price to them\" explained Chen Gu, \"if we sell the ingredients from hunted monsters to the Dojo, we also earn contribution points but the price is lower. If we sell them to the underground alliance marketplace, we get more money but no contribution points. Naturally, which one you decide to sell to is entirely up to you\"Luo Feng laughed, as to this point, he already read some posts on the fighter discussion thread, so he knew this a long time ago.Selling to the Dojo gives contribution points and money.Selling to the underground alliance marketplace gives only money, but a lot of it.\"Brother Wang, you've already been working for the entire night, take a break and leave it to me\" a soft sound rang. Luo Feng, who was holding his tea cup, suddenly turned his head as if he was shocked by electricity.At the bar, there was a young woman in a white, collared shirt and long black pants, who was changing positions with another manager.In this bar, there were 12 waiters and a manager. The bar was open 24 hours and they had 8 hour shifts, so there were three different groups.\"Xu Xin?\" Luo Feng looked with disbelief at the female manager. A professional woman who had an air of nobleness around her. There is no way an ordinary person can become the manager of the bar of the underground alliance's lobby. This is a place that was made just to serve fighters!Just to become a waiter, you would probably have to graduate from a prestigious college and undergo tons of training, not to mention a bar manager.\"Xu Xin.....\"How did that plain high school girl in the past change herself so dramatically?\"Brother Chen, brother Zhang, I'm going to go over there for a bit\". Luo Feng left his bag, shield, blade, etc. on the sofa, and he stood up smiling as he headed over to the bar.In the bar.Xu Xin's head was lowered as she checked the supplies at the counter, suddenly -\"Xu Xin\" - a familiar voice rang.\"Hm?\" Xu Xin was shocked. The people who knew her in the lobby usually called her 'Manager Xu', and usually the fighters don't know her name. How could someone call her 'Xu Xin', and this voice sounds so familiar. Xu Xin raised her head--At this time, Luo Feng's head was lowered as he looked into the bar, and Xu Xin was half-squatted as she finished checking the wine and raised her head.Their gazes met.Luo Feng and Xu Xin both suddenly had the same feeling, their hearts throbbed a bit.\"Luo Feng, why are you here?\" Xu Xin reacted, and she stood up as she laughed.\"Even Xu Xin can become a manager here, how come I can't be here?\" laughed Luo Feng as he said. Looking at the young woman in front of him, Luo Feng couldn't help but to think about his times in high school, where he sat in the back of the classroom and silently looked at Xu Xin's back..... he had a crush for a long time, but he just didn't have the chance to confess.He thought he would probably never see Xu Xin again, but he ended up meeting her right before his first trip to the wilderness at the HR alliance market.\"Ah, Luo Feng, you're a fighter?\" Xu Xin saw Luo Feng's outfit and couldn't help but to say in surprise.\"Yea, I'll be going to the wilderness soon\" laughed Luo Feng.\"The wilderness?\" Xu Xin's face changed a bit.All over the world, the areas other than the cities were called the wilderness. For the people who live in the cities, the wilderness was basically a replacement for the forbidden area of death. There were all types of monsters there: sinister, strange ones, and large, barbaric ones. There were also existences that were near invincible.Only the strongest of mankind, the 'fighters', could go there and fight the monsters.Xu Xin couldn't have thought..... that Luo Feng was a fighter, and that he was about to enter the wilderness.In reality, Xu Xin knew that Luo Feng liked her a bit..... this kind of thing was impossible to hide. Luo Feng constantly looked at her every day in class, and Xu Xin naturally caught Luo Feng staring at her when she turned her head. Naturally, Xu Xin understood Luo Feng's thoughts.It was just that both sides failed to point it out.\"Luo Feng, the captain's here, come\" shouted Chen Gu.\"I'll be going there\" said Luo Feng to Xu Xin.\"Okay\" nodded Xu Xin.Luo Feng went back to his original place. At this time, three people arrived, and two of them looked similar. One look is enough to tell you that they're twins. Both of them had a shield and a scimitar on their backs. The third man was extremely large and had two black sledgehammers that were glowing with a bit of silver.\"Luo Feng, these two are the famous 'Twin Moon Scimitar' brothers of the Wei family, Wei Tie and Wei Qing\" smiled Chen Gu as he said.The Wei brothers nodded their heads towards Luo Feng and put down their shields and scimitars and sat down.\"Brother Tie, brother Qing\" smiled Luo Feng as he greeted.The other members of the fire hammer squad are much older than Luo Feng, at least 10 years older. Compared to the other five people, Luo Feng indeed seems like a little brother.\"This, is the captain of our fire hammer squad, 'Dual Wind Hammer' Gao Feng\" said Chen Gu. Luo Feng couldn't help but to notice that captain 'Gao Feng', wasn't that tall. He was barely past 180 cm. His speciality was that he was extremely well built, as if he was made out of steel bars.Gao Feng sneered, and the muscles of his face were like rocks as he approached: \"Luo Feng, you also use a blade, so after entering the wilderness, try to get some experience from Wei Tie and Wei Qing. You have good talent, so I'm sure you'll swiftly become a member of our team\"\"Okay\" nodded Luo Feng.No matter what, his first priority is to not become a burden for this elite fighter squad.\"Take a break and we'll leave\" said Gao Feng.\"Yes, captain\"Including Luo Feng, the five of them nodded.In just twenty minutes, Gao Feng and the others finished their drinks and stood up, \"Let's go, to the wilderness\". Luo Feng immediately picked up his ghost blade, shield, etc.\"Luo Feng\" - a sound rang.Luo Feng turned his head.At this time, Xu Xin's chest pounded a bit. For some reason, the thought of Luo Feng entering the dangerous wilderness made her worried. Maybe Xu Xin also started to develop some special feelings for the boy who had a crush on her during high school.\"Yes?\" Luo Feng looked at Xu Xin.\"In the next few days, school will start for me. But during college, I'll be the manager here on Fridays and the weekend\" Xu Xin yelled, \"You better come at those times\". As she yelled this, Xu Xin's face started to turn red.\"Okay, I'll come for sure\"Luo Feng let out a smile.\"You picked one up so quickly? Nice!\" Chen Gu slapped Luo Feng shoulder as he laughed loudly.\"This is one of the benefits of being young, all the beautiful women stick to you\" laughed Gao Feng on the side. Since he already determined to let Luo Feng join the fire hammer squad, naturally they'll treat him as a brother.Luo Feng just laughed.\"Let's go!\"\"Get on the car!\"The six of the Fire Squad team members got on the HR alliance private car and headed towards the train station, where they'll ride a train headed towards the wilderness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere was a military camp a few hundred miles away from the northern part of Jiang-Nan city.[RUMBLE~~] The train slowly came to a halt at the military sector's station.Fully armed fighters got off the train one by one, for a total of twenty. These twenty people naturally formed four squads.\"Luo Feng, usually when we fighters go out to hunt monsters, we enter the military sectors to resupply\" Chen Gu pointed ahead of him, where a tall, steel tower that was around 50 or 60 meters high was, \"See this tower? Across China, and even the world, the military cuts out a special sector of the wilderness to serve as a base for fighters to rest and resupply. These resupplying locations are marked with these lighthouses. In other words, it shows us fighters the way home\".Luo Feng nodded.In the resupplying base in the military sector, there was a solemn, small building, which had a good environment.\"Fire hammer squad, you guys will stay at #E6 to rest\" an officer of the base gave the captain of the fire hammer squad, 'Gao Feng', a key as he laughed and patted his shoulder, \"Old Gao, how long do you plan on hunting for this time? If you ever get anything good, you're welcome to sell it to my underground alliance. I'll be sure to give you a great price\"Even though most of the staff here were wearing military uniforms....In fact, most of the service staff came from the Dojo of Limits, the Thunder Dojo, the government's army, and the underground alliance. Even though they were there to serve, they also purchase precious ingredients obtained from monsters from the fighters.\"Haha, sure\" laughed Gao Feng, \"hurry and arrange for people to make us lunch\".The resupplying base wasn't that big.\"E6, over there\" The fire hammer squad quickly found the small three story building representing 'E6'. The key was in a form of a chip. After sliding the key across the door, it opened. Before the fire hammer squad leaves the resupplying base, the ownership of the building belongs to them.\"Gonna lay for a bit and sleep, didn't sleep well last night\" Chen Gu put down his two metal boxes and jumped on the sofa. He stretched his body across the sofa and got comfortable.\"If you want to rest then rest now, we'll officially depart tonight. At that time, you'll need to focus\" commanded captain Gao Feng.\"Understood\"'Spear' Zhang Ke and the Twin Moon Scimitar brothers laughed in response, since they knew about the rules ages ago.\"Departing tonight?\" Luo Feng was surprised.\"Luo Feng, aren't you even paying attention to the weather? It's the end of September, which is the hottest time of the year. Running with a couple hundred kilograms worth of things in the middle of the day? No matter how much water you bring, it won't be enough, so you can only drink from the river\" Chen Gu laughed as he looked at Luo Feng, \"Isn't it better to run during the night? And it saves water\"Luo Feng laughed awkwardly.Even though he read many posts, he never realized this point.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng's gaze passed through the window and saw someone in the resupplying base, \"Brother Chen, look, isn't that Zhang Ze Hu?\". At that time, Zhang Ze Hu's body was covered in bandages and there were marks of blood on the sandbags, clearly showing that he was injured and was recovering in the resupplying base.Chen Gu turned his head to look: \"Yea, that is Zhang Ze Hu\"\"Heh!\" Chen Gu walked to the door and delightly yelled, \"Mountain Tiger, what's wrong? Weren't you just fine last time, how come you got so injured in just a blink of an eye?\"Zhang Ze Hu, who was outside walking and chatting with his comrades, turned his head and saw Chen Gu and Luo Feng at the door. He got so mad his teeth started to itch, and as his anger raged, he gave a loud, mocking retort: \"Fire Cannon Chen, your fire hammer squad is an elite squad, so how come you brought a rookie? Haha, I bet your entire team will get dragged down by that burden!\"Elite squads usually aren't willing to bring rookies.Because even if the rookie's body fitness is good, without any experience, he could mess up during crucial moments, which could mess up the veteran members.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdZhang Ze Hu and Chen Gu exchanged some insults, but because captain 'Twin Hammer' Gao Feng's yell, Zhang Ze Hu went silent. Even though he was brave enough to argue with Chen Gu at times, he didn't dare to argue with Gao Feng! Because, Gao Feng uses cold weapons while Chen Gu uses heated weapons.With heated weapons, even if you reach the top, you can only reach the 'beginner warlord rank', because heated weapons like guns usually can only harm 'low level commander level' monsters.Zhang Ze Hu was very close to the 'warlord' rank.\"Fuck, can't believe Luo Feng drifted into the fire hammer squad\". Zhang Ze Hu walked with his comrades on the road, his mouth still cursing, \"I thought he would get into a regular squad. That way, I can cruelly teach him a lesson to let him know the consequences of messing with me. However, he got in the fire hammer squad!\"Zhang Ze Hu's teeth seethed in rage.\"Tiger, that young man next to Chen Gu just now, is the Luo Feng who made you spend 100 million?\" said the one-eyed middle aged man next to him.\"Yea, that's him\"Zhang Ze Hu's eyes shone fiercely, \"This rabbit, I didn't think he'd be so cocky. After that discussion, right after I turned my head, the security agency ran straight to my nephew's home! This kid actually reported it to the security agency. I quickly gave the country a hundred million to let my nephew attain the 'one star civilian' rank. However, even after that, my nephew is still going to get locked up for a few months\".When he thinks about how nervous his older brother was, and Zhang Hao Bai's shock and horror as he was taken by the security agency, Zhang Ze Hu got even more mad.Although later he spent 100 million to keep his nephew. However, Zhang Hao Bai wasn't able to escape a few months of pain in jail.\"It's ok, don't think too much. Letting your nephew go through some hardship is good for him\" The one-eyed middle aged man laughed softly, \"You should use this time to rest. Your wounds should heal in about three days, and then we'll depart and can keep dealing with that old guy. After killing that old guy, our team will become rich\".\"Okay\" Zhang Ze Hu nodded heavily, and he stole a glance at the E6 building in the distance and sneered, \"I'm willing to bet that Luo Feng will either die or receive a heavy wound in his first entry into the wilderness!\"\"Haha, you sure hold a grudge against him. However, it is indeed hard to avoid injury in the first entry into the wilderness\" laughed the one-eyed middle aged man.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdMidnight, the fully equipped six members of the fire hammer squad departed the resupply base and entered the wilderness.\"Chen Gu, give me one of your metal boxes\" commanded captain Gao Feng.\"Haha, thanks captain. I can handle carrying these boxes for a short period of time, but not for long periods\" said Chen Gu as he handed one of his big metal boxes over to captain Gao Feng. Gao Feng easily took it with one hand and carried it on his back. This amount of weight is nothing to the strongest member of the fire hammer squad, Gao Feng.[KA!]Chen Gu opened the other box, which had a gray machine gun in it. The gun's muzzle had a metallic luster. Other than the machine gun, there were tons of bullets all packed together, which filled up the entire box. Obviously, there were an immense amount of bullets.\"Brother Chen, what kind of gun is this?\" asked Luo Feng curiously.\"Type m81, 12.7mm caliber. It can fire 50 to 300 rounds in a minute, adjustable\" laughed Chen Gu contented, \"The whole gun is made out of 3rd grade Ke-Luo alloy, so even if it continuously fires bullets, the heat of the gun won't affect the accuracy of the bullets\".Luo Feng asked curiously: \"Brother Chen, how come you don't use the fire-god cannon? Don't the machine guns of the fire-god series have the greatest power?\"\"You rookie!\"Chen Gu glared.Spear 'Zhang Ke' laughed on the side and said: \"Luo Feng, the machine guns of the fire-god series do indeed have great power. However, the fire-god series uses up crazy amounts of bullets. It fires 7,000 shots in a minute, and some can shoot even faster. Do you know what that means? 7,000 shots in one minute. And bullets that can harm a low level commander level monster is at lightest 50 grams! Ten thousand bullets will weigh 500 kg!\"\"Running hundreds of miles with 500 kg of bullets on your back. And finally, when you kill the monster, after a minute or so your fire-god cannon has used up all its bullets\". Zhang Ke laughed and looked at Luo Feng, \"So what do you say? Is the fire-god cannon good?\"Luo Feng was startled.He really did not understand this. Yes, the weight of the bullets is a big problem. 7,000 bullets in a minute, how many bullets do you have to bring with you for the entire trip?\"Hauling a huge amount of bullets along with a fire-god cannon is only done by the army or when dealing with a specific type of monster. Usually, people like us will never use those types of guns, since there aren't that many bullets for it\". Chen Gu laughed at himself, \"I brought 10,000 bullets this time and even asked the captain to help me carry some\".Chen Gu had bullet chains wrapped all over his body and held a machine gun. With Luo Feng, these two were in the middle of the team, protected by the others.The twin moon scimitar brothers were in front of the team.Captain Gao Feng and Zhang Ke were in the back.\"We'll head along this highway. After about three days, we should reach our destination--#0201 country level city\", said captain Gao Feng, but Luo Feng couldn't help but to keep looking at the highway in front of him. For the people living in the cities, highways only exist in legends.The highway under their feet was already ruined; tons of cracks have already opened up on it.Looking ahead, there were tons of broken or split cars, vans, and trucks all over the highway as it stretched down. There were even some broken tires lying around. Sometimes, you can see marks of dried up blood on the floor too.\"Let's go!\"The red light of the sunset shone on this quiet, rundown highway that has been broken for dozens of years. The six members of the fire hammer squad continued to head forward.[GROWL~~][WAIL~~]Waves and waves of howling from the monsters carried from the two fields and ruined villages on the sides of the highway. Even Luo Feng could see quite a few monsters. The other five members of the fire hammer squad were relaxed, but Luo Feng was completely tense..... because he could feel the monsters everywhere.\"Hm, Luo Feng, there's a horned boar ahead. I'll leave it to you\" captain Gao Feng's voice rang, \"This will be your first battle in the wilderness!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Luo Feng, this is your first battle, so don't get cocky. These monsters are much more ferocious than the ones they breed in the military\" Chen Gu solemnly reminded. Luo Feng laughed, he knew brother Chen was worried about him. In this fire hammer squadron, he is definitely closer with Chen Gu and Zhang Ke, who are also in the Ming-Yue sector.As for captain Gao Feng and Wei Jia brothers....Since he was new and wasn't familiar with them, it was going to be hard to get Gao Feng and his group's recognition.\"Good luck, Luo Feng. With your current speed and reaction speed, you're just at the level of an 'Advanced Fighter'. Your power is also nearing that level too. There should be no problem facing this horned boar\" Spear Zhang Ke, surprisingly, also gave some words of encouragement.The other three, captain Gao Feng and the Wei Jia brothers, watched Luo Feng.[CHI!]Luo Feng pulled out his ghost blade. With his left hand holding his shield and his right hand holding his ghost blade, he smiled: \"Captain, brother Chen, watch me get that horned boar's horn\". As he said that, Luo Feng rushed towards it.They watched Luo Feng go.\"Captain, don't you think giving Luo Feng a rank F horned boar is expecting too much out of him for his first fight?\" Chen Gu couldn't help but to say, \"Even though our fire hammer squad should test him, we have to do it step by step. It'll be better if we get a rank G monster instead\"\"Yeah, we can't rush this\" Zhang Ke also spoke.\"There's no problem with the captain's arrangements\" The older of the Wei Jia brothers, 'Wei Tie', said lowly, \"Luo Feng's body fitness level isn't inferior to that beast. Even though it is a bit difficult, he should be able to win with a bit of suffering and pain\".\"But this is his first time entering the wilderness\" Zhang Ke wasn't convinced.\"So what if it's his first time? I don't want him to become a burden. Or else, how are we supposed to hunt some stronger monsters with a rookie?\" Wei Qing frowned on the side.At this time--Out of the five veteran members of the fire hammer squad, Chen Gu and Zhang Ke were clearly on Luo Feng's side, while the Wei Jia brothers were suspicious of him.\"Stop arguing\" Gao Feng spoke.Chen Gu and the others quieted down.\"Watch, talk after watching Luo Feng's battle with the horned boar\" Gao Feng said expressionlessly.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdLike a nimble jaguar, Luo Feng raced to the back of a flipped car on the highway. From there, he looked towards the horned boar that wasn't too far away. All the hairs on the boar were black, and each hair was like a black needle. And its horn was like an edged blade!Under the light of the evening sun, the horn's edge reflected a freezing coldness.If the iron fur boar in the fighter combat exam was like a heavy, savage hummer, then this horned boar is--a flexible, sturdy existence\ufffd\ufffd\"This is my first battle, so I need to put on a good show\"\"I was only able to join the fire hammer squad because of two reasons: Chief instructor Zhu Ge's request, but more importantly, brother Chen and brother Zhang's help\". Luo Feng was clear on one point: it was very hard for a rookie to join an elite fighter squad. Captain Gao Feng and the Wei Jia brothers are clearly suspicious of me, so I need to prove myself with this battle!Luo Feng stared at the horned boar, who was currently searching for prey.The three levels, H, G, F, are the titles for low level soldier, medium level soldier, and high level soldier, respectively. Clearly, the horned boar in front was nearing the F level.[HOWL~~HOWL~~]The horned boar roared and scanned the surrounding with its murderous stare.\"It found me\". Luo Feng's heart rate increased, and he was a bit excited.[BOOM!] The horned boar flew ferociously towards him, like a high speed tank. It directly rammed into the 'flipped hummer' that was in front of Luo Feng. Luo Feng dashed away like a nimble monkey, and with a boom, the hummer was blasted away and rolled several times on the highway. The hummer that has been exposed to the sun and wind for several decades immediately split up, and the tires rolled on the highway for a while until they stopped.Within a moment of dodging, Luo Feng headed straight towards the horned boar.\"Die, scum!\" howled Luo Feng.Like lightning, he shot towards the horned boar, and the ghost blade in his hand instantly flashed towards the horned boar's head. It seemed like the horned boar that just rammed the hummer didn't have enough time to dodge, but right when Luo Feng approached it--[XIU]A black shadow headed straight towards Luo Feng's brain.\"So fast\". Luo Feng was startled, and with a step of his foot, he barely managed to twist his body to evade the black shadow. This black shadow was the horned boar's tail, which was like a steel whip!\"Puff!\" \"Puff!\"After retracting its tail, the horned boar soared nimbly, and flew straight towards Luo Feng. Its rough, steel hooves and its sharp, blade-like horn were headed straight at him.\"Fuck, this boar is too damn fast\" Luo Feng stepped back again and he raised the shield in his hand.[BAM!]The shield and the horned boar's hooves collided ferociously. In the moment of collision, Luo Feng used the rebounding force to go into a dive, where he rolled on the floor to divert the force. The horned boar chased right after him, and Luo Feng rolled to a broken truck and, with a dart, got behind the truck.With the truck blocking, the horned boar's lunge wasn't able to achieve its desired effect......After watching this scene from afar, the five members of the fire hammer squad all slightly nodded.\"Captain, Luo Feng has good reflexes doesn't he\" laughed Chen Gu.Captain Gao Feng smiled as he nodded: \"He is good. I thought he would have a hard time with this horned boar on his first time! I didn't think his reflexes would be so good. His basic skills are pretty good too, his shield block was done skillfully, and his movements flowed like water. This Luo Feng didn't even receive any injury from the barrage of attacks from the horned boar! Good!\"The Wei Jia brothers' cold expressions finally loosened up a bit.\"Wei Tie, Wei Qing, Luo Feng's good ain't he\" Zhang Ke let out a smile too.\"This battle isn't over yet, so we still can't tell\" said Wei Tie coldly.The five members of the fire hammer squad continued watching the battle between Luo Feng and the horned boar......Luo Feng was concentrating extremely hard, and thought to himself: \"This horned boar is so sinister; he purposefully made me think it was weak at the beginning. And then it suddenly used its tail to attack me and then rushed me with its hooves and horn. Along with the final crazy dash..... it chained all of these into a combo. Thankfully I've been practicing the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdthese past few days, so I have more precise control over all of my strength!\"He has been practicing the Nine Stage Thunder Blade this past month.It seems that Luo Feng will need to use some of his spiritual force to be able to get out of the horned boar's barrage unscathed.[ROAR~~] The horned boar howled, it didn't foolishly collide into the truck, but it jumped over it and rushed straight towards Luo Feng.\"Scum, this time, you're dead!\"Luo Feng ferociously kicked the tire next to him, and as if it was launched by a trebuchet, it flew straight towards the horned boar. The horned boar didn't slow down at all; it merely lowered its head slightly. The horn on its head, whose sharpness had no rival, split the tire in half, which then fell apart and dropped.Luo Feng headed straight towards the horned boar after kicking the tire.[ROAR~~] Right after hitting the tire away, the horned boar turned its head and directed its horn towards Luo Feng.\"Die!\"At this moment, Luo Feng made a flexible turn like a butterfly and just barely evaded the horn. While turning, the ghost blade in Luo Feng's hand, with help from the rotational energy, slashed instantly! The ghost blade then picked up even more speed during the slash!\"Puff!\"As fast as lightning, the spinning blade directly hacked into the head of the horned boar. Luo Feng could clearly feel the rigidness and toughness of the hair of the horned boar. No regular bullet could pierce through this hair.Fresh, red blood leaked out, and after cutting into 5 cm of the boar's head, Luo Feng's blade couldn't go any deeper.[HOWL~~]The horned boar howled crazily, and ferociously turned its head to ram into Luo feng.The injured horned boar, became even more fierce!......\"What!\"\"Such agile technique!\"The Wei Jia brothers' faces were filled with shock.\"He could dodge the horn of the horned boar so delicately!\", exclaimed the older sibling 'Wei Tie', \"Incredible. And he dared to turn in front of the horned boar's horn like that. Wasn't he afraid of the horned boar's 'horn' piercing through his body? Amazing. Is this bullshit luck, or does he actually have skill?\"The turn seemed simple, but it revealed Luo Feng's astonishing technique.\"Good\"\"Beautiful\" Chen Gu and Zhang Ke couldn't help but to praise.\"This kid, has strength\" laughed Gao Feng with a smile, \"In such a dangerous situation, he dared to do such a thing and was even successful. His technique is not average! His timing was also good, but..... this boar's life force is incredibly strong. Killing this horned boar is no easy task\"The five members of the fire hammer squad, including the Wei Jia brothers, all let out a smile.The five of them continued to watch from far away, the battle between Luo Feng and the crazed horned boar!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

PA!Foul blood streamed along the thick skin of the horned boar's neck, dripping onto the dust filled highway. The horned boar had a crazed look in its eyes, and as it howled deeply, it madly rushed at Luo Feng again and again like lightning. The hooves, horn, and tail: all three kinds of attacks kept coming unrelentlessly.\"After its head injury, the flexibility in its head turning has clearly decreased by a lot\". Luo Feng dodged agilely.In the fighter combat exam, he fought seven H level monsters at the same time to train himself. Even though the concentrated attacks of seven H level monsters are a bit below the level of the F level horned boar, the difference wasn't large.WHOOSH!Luo Feng didn't retreat. With an elegant dodge to the side, the horned boar's horn missed Luo Feng's body by just three centimeters. However, these three centimeters acted like a barrier, so the horned boar couldn't harm Luo Feng at all.\"Attack!\"The ghost blade in Luo Feng's hand came crashing down! It brought an ear piercing sound, and the horned boar immediately howled out in rage. It used all of its might on its four hooves to try and avoid Luo Feng's blade. But..... Luo Feng's blade was too fast, and only the sound of the blade entering its flesh was heard.CHI--Another strike to the neck. Even though it wasn't in the same location as before, this one cut into a depth of 8 cm!\"Hmph, with its last injury, the muscles of its neck couldn't exert a hundred percent of its force to block the attack. Next time I attack, its neck's defense will be even weaker\". Right when Luo Feng slashed into the neck, he immediately retreated, easily avoiding the crazed counter attack from the enraged horned boar. After that, Luo Feng closed the distance again![ROAR~~ ROAR~~] The horned boar let out an enraged howl.\"Last time!\"Luo Feng swayed for three steps, causing an illusion, and then once again dodged the horned boar's attack. What followed those agile steps was Luo Feng's sharp blade!\"\"PU-CHI\"At first, it was quite difficult to slash into, but after cutting into a depth of 12 cm, the resistance rapidly decreased. After Luo Feng's ghost blade cut into two thirds of the horned boar's neck, he pulled out his blade and rapidly retreated!Blood flowed like a fountain from that gigantic wound![Ao~~~]came a shrill. The horned boar's entire body was twitching, and its hooves were stomping unconsciously. The asphalt of the highway was cracking under the stomping. After that, the unconscious boar threw itself around and crashed against the curved railing at the side of the highway, breaking it and falling down.Its noise got weaker, and then it stopped.Luo Feng stood beside the broken highway railing, looking down on the horned boar's corpse whose head was about to fall off. Blood rapidly stopped flowing, since almost all of it has flowed out already. There was probably at least a barrels worth of blood that flowed out.\"Dead!\" Luo Feng leaped down and, using his ghost blade, cut off the horn.The most important part of the horned boar's body is just this one horn!\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe five members of the fire hammer squad couldn't help but to let out a breathe as they watched from afar.\"Abnormal!\"\"Monster!\"These two words came from the Wei Jia brothers' mouths.\"How is he, I made a good recommendation, haven't I\" bragged Chen Gu. If we say the five of them were surprised before, then now they are completely shocked and stunned.\"Incredible\" Zhang Ke couldn't help but to say.Captain Twin Hammer \"Gao Feng\" stared at Luo Feng as he cut off the horn: \"How is Luo Feng's technique so good? The horned boar is above him in pure speed by a bit, but his consecutive dodges were light and smooth. Every dodge was like a cloud or a flowing river! If he can do this technique hundreds of thousands of times, then that'll be the Ru-Wei class!\"\"He's only 18, if he's Ru-Wei class! He should be sent to the world headquarters' dojo to undergo special training\" The older sibling of the Wei Jia brothers, 'Wei Tie', couldn't help but to say.Ru-Wei class.....Is a perfect dodge by using the smallest amount of power possible to delicately avoid the attack! This kind of dodge is extremely difficult, and an average fighter can only pull it off once or twice. However, if you can do it a hundred times or a thousand times, then that means you're truly Ru-Wei class!\"We've obtained a gem!\" Gao Feng let out a smile.The younger sibling, 'Wei Qing', surprisingly nodded too: \"Hm, after some nurturing, our fire hammer squad will have another capable member\".\"Me and Wei Qing will teach him\" said Wei Tie.Chen Gu and Zhang Ke laughed. As veterans who have walked on the border of life and death countless times, it was clear to them. Some geniuses have amazing body fitness levels, but when they actually have to fight a monster, they can't even bring out a tenth of their strength. Because of this, Chen Gu and Zhang Ke usually look down on these so called geniuses.A true professional has to go through countless dangerous battles!And Luo Feng was able to show such skill in his first battle. Clearly, he was a powerful fighter.\"Captain\" Luo Feng ran over, \"This horn.....\"\"You killed it, so of course this horn belongs to you\" said Gao Feng.Luo Feng nodded, and accepted it.There isn't much on a soldier level monster's body that's worth money, because all of the soldier level monsters can be killed by heated weapons..... Even a beginner warrior, with a machine gun and good shooting technique, could easily kill many soldier level monsters. So solider level monsters aren't worth money!\"If you sell this horn to the dojo, you'll probably get three thousand dollars and some contribution points. If you sell it to the underground alliance, you can probably get five thousand\" laughed Chen Gu.Only the material on the body is worth money.And important material on a \"commander level monster\" is worth a crazy amount of money!\"Luo Feng, with your performance just now, you barely pass\" said the older sibling of the Wei Jia brothers, 'Wei Tie', as he pouted.\"Brother Tie?\" Luo Feng looked over, \"Please guide me, brother Tie\".\"Your basics are good, but your efficiency is much too low\" said Wei Tie coldly, \"wait a bit and watch how I kill a F level monster\".......What Luo Feng killed was a monster nearing the F level. After they departed, they quickly encountered a F rank cat family 'Ocelot monster'. This ocelot had some stripes on it and was as tough as a bull. It was superior to the horned boar in flexibility and savageness by far.\"Watch me\" said Wei Tie coldly.WHOOSH!With the shield in his left hand and scimitar in his right, he charged straight towards the ocelot in a straight line!\"Brother Tie is in the advanced warrior class, so his body fitness level is similar to this F level ocelot\" Luo Feng watched carefully. He only observed that Wei Tie wasn't trying to dodge anything and just crashed into the ocelot. No, actually, right when the ocelot was about to crash into Wei Tie...Wei Tie's body moved sideways and his shield crashed into the ocelot at an angle.Crashing at this angle knocked the ocelot off balance, causing it to stagger to the side.\"PU-CHI!\"A sinister cold light made an arc against the shield. It flashed across the exposed throat of the ocelot due to it being knocked off balance. Soon after, fresh blood sprayed out like a fountain, and Wei Tie retreated quickly. He coldly looked at the ocelot monster howling in pain until it slowly fell over and lost its breath.Wei Tie cut off the ocelot's tail and took out an almost transparent tendon. He put it in his bag and walked back.\"Did you see that? My technique wasn't better than yours, and my power didn't exceed yours. However, I was able to kill it in one hit\" Wei Tie looked at Luo Feng.Luo Feng fell into shock.The battle just now was finished in a flash. But for his battle, he had to dodge so many attacks and attack the neck of the horned boar over and over again. It took him quite a bit of energy to kill it. And that horned boar was clearly weaker than this ocelot monster.\"Think about it deeply\" Wei Tie didn't explain anything and let Luo Feng think about it himself.Luo Feng was completely shocked.Wei Tie's speed and technique weren't anything out of the ordinary, and yet he produced such amazing results!\"The best way to kill a monster is to aim for its weak points!\". The younger sibling of the Wei Jia brothers, 'Wei Qing', said indifferently, \"Usually for mammals, their weak points are their eyes, throat, and mouth. One stage below that would be their soft abdomen..... one stage below that would be the neck you were slashing into!\"Luo Feng nodded, he knew this. But the monsters move so quickly, so stabbing their eyes is difficult! And for the horned boar and the ocelot who always lower their heads so much, hitting the throat is hard too. Even the abdomen is hard to hit, so attacking the neck was the simplest way.\"There won't be many chances to attack the monster's weak points. The monsters aren't stupid, they'll protect their weak points properly\"\"However, if there aren't any chances, then you can make them!\"\"For example, my brother crashed into the ocelot at an angle with his shield, causing it to lose its balance. This made the ocelot expose its throat for a split second. He used his scimitar to slash it from the bottom of his shield and into the throat, which killed the ocelot in an instant\" Wei Qing said coldly, \"This was the last attack my brother did, and it was from the bottom of his shield, so the monster couldn't react at all!\"Luo Feng nodded.\"Remember, learn how to use your strong points\" said Wei Qing, \"You have to use them efficiently and cleanly! Your technique is good, but you don't have to flash your technique around every time to kill the monster. Always move towards the most efficient way to kill the monster\"\"Understood\" Luo Feng nodded.Wei Qing let out a rare smile.\"Let's go\" laughed Gao Feng as he waved.......The fire hammer squad clearly wanted Luo Feng to become a capable member in the future, so they trained him seriously. On the road, Wei Qing and Wei Tie took turns fighting the monsters that appeared, and sometimes let Luo Feng deal with them too. They taught him with words and techniques, and let Luo Feng get some real experience. Luo Feng's rate of improvement was also just as astonishing.Even the warlord level Gao Feng fought a few times, guiding Luo Feng in the process.Luo Feng knew, that you have to make each attack bring out all of its strength to kill a monster. And when he was fighting the horned boar before, his beautiful dodges were, in fact, useless! Luo Feng's attacks slowly became more sharp, direct, and effective!Three days laterDawn, on the broken city ring road, the six members of the fire hammer squad were moving forward.\"There are two F level mastiff lions, Luo Feng, go\" commanded captain Gao Feng.\"Yes, captain\"Luo Feng laughed and grinned, and headed towards the mastiff lions at an average speed.\"HOWL~~\" \"HOWL~~\" the mastiff lions roared at the incoming Luo Feng with bloodthirsty madness in their eyes. They didn't care much for this human in front of them, but when they got really near each other- -Luo Feng let out a smile on his faceWHOOSH!His speed accelerated rapidly! Both of the mastiff lion monster's hairs all stood up.Luo Feng closed the distance in an instant. The four abnormal steps he did was the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdtechnique 'Flowing Light'. He baited the claws of the mastiff lions, and with a twist of his body, accurately dodged their claws. As their bodies moved across each other, the ghost blade slashed sinisterly in an instant!PU! Slashed right in the throat.Luo Feng charged forwards and turned his head towards the other mastiff lion monster.\"HOWL~~\" when the mastiff lion monster saw fresh blood spraying from its comrade's throat, it howled and retreated swiftly.Chen Gu, Gao Feng, and the other members of the fire hammer squad let out a smile as they watched.Even though Luo Feng isn't as experienced as the Wei Jia brothers, but because of his technique, Luo Feng's killing power is not worse than either the older or younger sibling of the Wei Jia family.\"Luo Feng, let's go, hurry and enter the town! The mastiff lions are gregarious. The mastiff lion that ran away will soon bring a whole pack of them over here\" laughed Chen Gu. Luo Feng laughed as they all united. The six members of the fire hammer squad finally reached their destination--0201 country level city.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe fire hammer squad quietly entered the suburban part of the #0201 country level city.\"Luo Feng, we ran along the highway these past three days, which belongs to the desolate area.\" as they walked, Chen Gu kept his voice low and said, \"most of the monsters live in the city and in the built-up areas! Places like the counties and urban areas are the truly dangerous locations!\"\"Understood, brother Chen\" nodded Luo Feng.Luo Feng already read about the common habits of monsters in the posts.In the long war between monsters and humans, monsters found that if they live in relatively empty areas, the human army and fighters could lock-on to them from far away. Without anything to hide behind, the humans could use \"heavy sniper rifles\" and missiles to conduct long distance attacks!But in the city, there were tons of skyscrapers.As long as the monsters hid in the urban areas, snipers will rarely have a chance, unless they go inside the city! And right when the human army enters the city, they'll have to fight with the monsters on the streets, where the monsters will have an overwhelming advantage. Urban areas are the monsters' heaven!\"Naturally, the target for our fire hammer squad is a commander level monster! However.....\" reminded Chen Gu in a small voice, \"A commander level monster is intelligent, around the level of a human. The commander level monster will command large amounts of soldier level monsters to surround it. Virtually every commander level monster will be surrounded by large amounts of soldier level monsters, so it's very difficult to kill a commander level monster\".Luo Feng nodded.A soldier and a commander not only have a large difference in strength, but also--intelligence!To protect their lives, a commander level monster will naturally summon large amounts of soldier level monsters to protect it. Other than the extremely rare monsters that like to be independent, most commanders will be surrounded by soldiers.\"Everybody be careful, there's a steel clad bull lair up ahead\" said Gao Feng suddenly, \"The head of this steel clad bull lair is probably a high level commander, and there are large amounts of steel clad bulls in this lair. Let's go around it! Chen Gu, don't shoot. If a steel clad bull attacks, remember, kill it instantly. Don't let the steel clad bull call its comrades\".\"Yes, captain\"The other five all nodded.Unlike the deserted areas outside, the city and the suburbs are much more dangerous.The six members of the fire hammer squad carefully moved forward along a narrow path.\"Halt\" the older sibling of the Wei Jia family, 'Wei Tie', who was in front, raised his hand. He stared seriously in front of him, where a gigantic iron fur boar was lying far away. Beside the boar were two mastiff tiger monsters who had their heads lowered and were feasting on large bites of flesh. Suddenly, the mastiff tiger monster rose its head and looked at the fire hammer squad from far away and became much more cautious.\"We'll go around, don't do anything\" said Gao Feng in a small voice.On the deserted highway, Luo Feng and the others were relaxed; they could kill monsters whenever they felt like it. However, it's different in the city.......After treading carefully on the way, taking at least ten detours, and killing eight regular soldier level monsters instantly, Luo Feng and the others finally arrived at their first destination--a small sector in the #0201 country level city, 'Blue Sky Sector'. The reason why the blue sky sector was the fire hammer squad's first target was because there were three residential apartments that were 21 stories high.\"Go, to the roof\"\"Everyone be careful, a monster might pop out of who knows where in the building\"\"Don't make too much noise\"The six members of the fire hammer squad went along the staircase.\"Howl~~~\" a low pitched howl emanated within the building, which made the six members of the fire hammer squad frown. Wei Tie, who was furthest in front, said in a small voice: \"It should be upstairs, everybody be careful\". Everybody had their weapon in hand and were prepared to strike. And Chen Gu, who used heated weapons, was being protected in the center.They went forward one step at a time.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng saw a two meter tall lion mastiff monster suddenly appear from the corner in front. It's fur was long and it looked like a gigantic military SUV. When the lion mastiff monster saw the them, it immediately howled, sending a blood scented wind at them.The fire hammer squad was going upstairs and the lion mastiff monster dived at them with the energy gained from its gigantic body.WHOOSH! WHOOSH!Wei Tie and Wei Qing in the front had almost identical movements. With a shield in one hand and a scimitar in the other, they charged forward at the same time and barely grazed the lion mastiff monster's body. As their bodies grazed past each other, the scimitars drew curved lines that passed through the joints of the lion mastiff's front claws.The brothers Wei Tie and Wei Qing used the exact same technique!This caused the front two claws of the lion mastiff monster to stagger and fall onto the stairs. At this time, spear 'Zhang Ke', who was behind Wei Tie and Wei Qing, instantly moved forward. His alloyed spear carried a metallic sound with it as he pierced the lion mastiff monster's head.PU-CHI! The spear instantly pierced through the lion mastiff monster's eyes and went through its head!\"ROAR~~\" The lion mastiff monster unconsciously stepped forward twice and then fell powerlessly.The cooperation between Wei Qing, Wei Tie, and Zhang Ke was indeed marvelous! The first two took care of the lion mastiff's front limbs to make it lose its balance, which was immediately followed up by Zhang Ke's spear for a one hit kill! Zhang ke was horrifyingly accurate with his spear, he actually pierced right through the eye.......In the process of climbing up the staircase, the fire hammer squad encountered three monsters, which was considered quite lucky. Out of these three monsters, one of them actually charged up from the ground level. At that time, Luo Feng and Gao Feng were at the back of the team, so naturally it was Luo Feng who had to cleanly kill the G level monster.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdAfter exiting the staircase, the six members of the fire hammer squad arrived at the rooftop of the 21 story residential apartment.\"Shut the door to the staircase, shut it completely freaking tight!\" commanded Gao Feng, \"Stop any monsters from running up here to the rooftop\".\"Yes'.Luo Feng and Zhang Ke went to close the steel doors of the staircase, and found a steel rod to jam the door.\"Phew, we can finally loosen up a bit\" a rare smile appeared on Zhang Ke's face. He directly sat on his bottom on the roof and took out some high carb food and water.\"Everyone brought their binoculars right\" said Gao Feng, \"Everyone take out their binoculars and look down from the roof and try to find a commander level monster! Remember, don't expose your body too much; it'll be a bit troublesome if a monster discovers you!\". However, it was actually very safe on the rooftop.The residential apartment was 21 stories high, so most of the monsters couldn't climb up from the outside anyway.Even if a commander level monster commands the monsters to slaughter their way up, how wide is the staircase? The threat wasn't large. The fire hammer squad has enough time to completely escape.\"Start searching for a commander level monster\"\"Yo guys, time to start finding some monsters\"Luo Feng also took out his binoculars from his bag, and some supporting tools like screws. Everyone brought them, since they weren't heavy.He squatted onto the side of the roof and looked down onto the street. There were large amounts of monsters everywhere he looked: \"The city area has at least ten or a hundred times more monsters\". And on one of the streets, one glance showed that there were at least hundreds of monsters walking forward.Even a warlord level fighter has a slim chance of escaping alive from hundreds of normal monsters.\"Captain, these are all soldier level monsters\"\"I don't see any commander level monsters here either\"Five of the members, including the captain, were all holding their binoculars and looking down from the roof at different spots. Only when standing on a high location could you see far. On the roof of a 21 story residential apartment, you can see really far, and also see many monsters.\"KA!\" a steel case opened. The only member of the fire hammer squad who wasn't using a binocular, Chen Gu, opened the steel case. Other than large amounts of ammunition, there was another long, rectangular shaped wooden case in the steel case. In the wooden case, there were a few mechanical parts, which Chen Gu swiftly assembled.A moment later--A silverish gray heavy sniper rifle that was nearly two meters long was assembled. It's optical aimer device and other things were also completely assembled.Chen Gu put special bullets into the clip, for a total of ten bullets.\"Captain, notify me if you find a commander level monster\" said Chen Gu.\"Yup, you can first sleep for a bit and rest yourself. Leave the search for the commander level monster to us\" nodded Gao Feng, while at the same time commanding the others, \"Guys, focus and don't miss anything\". This was the easiest way to hunt for a commander level monster in the city. Staying at a high location lets you see farther.This is ten to a hundred times faster than searching for a commander level monster on the streets, and also much safer.Luo Feng, Zhang Ke, the Wei Jia brothers and Gao Feng, the five of them held their binoculars and carefully looked below, while Chen Gu narrowed his eyes and went to sleep while holding his heavy sniper rifle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen the six members of the fire hammer squad were searching for a commander level monster and hiding on the rooftop of the blue sky sector's residential hall.... Around 30 km away from the #0201 country level city on the ruined highway was a six-man elite fighter group rushing towards the #0201 country level city.All six of them had a tiger shaped medal on their left breast pocket of their battle uniform.This was the famous \"Tiger Fang Squad\" of Jiang-Nan city. There were six people in the tiger fang squad: two of them used heated weapons, and the other four used cold weapons. Two of the four that used cold weapons were warlord level fighters, and the other two were advanced warrior level fighters! And the two that used heated weapons were also warlord level!Actually, as long as you have enough talent, experience, and time, it's quite easy to reach the warlord level using heated weapons.Because they rely on their guns and bullets!\"Old Han, have you found that old guy's position yet?\" asked Zhang Ze Hu in a small voice. This Zhang Ze Hu was indeed one of the six members of the tiger fang squad, and was an advanced warrior level fighter. In terms of strength, the tiger fang squad was extremely powerful. The weakest members were both advanced warrior level fighters, and these two were barely away from the warlord level.\"According to the signal flare I left on that old guy, it's probably 40 km away from us. According to me, I'd think it's in the #0201 country level city ahead!\" said the guy who was holding and looking at a compass-like instrument.\"Finally confirmed the position\"\"If we can hunt down this old guy this time, we brothers are gonna be rich\".The people of the tiger fang squad laughed.When they were hunting for monsters before, they found the wolf type monster, 'Hunter', by chance. There were lots of different classifications for the monsters today. Before the Grand Nirvana period, there were mostly pigs, dogs, cats, cows, and sheep in society. So most of the monsters today are mostly pig type, dog type, cat type, cow type, sheep type, snake type, etc. Monsters like foxes, monkeys, scorpions, wolves, tigers, and jaguars are rarer.Wolves, tigers, and jaguars were already strong, so after a mutation, they'd become beyond horrifying.Of course, since there are so many regular monsters, some of them become horrifying existences.For example, one of the cat type monsters is a legendary existence--Nine Lives Demon Cat!The Nine Lives Demon Cat is the most frightening monster within the cat type monster category. It has nine tails, and it's strength surpasses a horde leader! On the entire earth, it's considered as one of the scariest monsters in the rankings.......Since the wolf type monsters have a high reproduction ability, fighters could often encounter a few wolf type monsters this past decade.And the 'Hunter' is one of the most horrifying mutations within the wolf type monster category. They're also called the king of the wolves--'Silver Moon Wolf', each silver moon wolf is practically independent, and they love hunting other monsters and fighters. As they're also sly and cruel, they got the name of 'Hunter'.As of now, the weakest known silver moon wolf is a 'medium commander level monster', so a head of a silver moon wolf is worth a fortune.\"This hunter we're chasing is probably a \"high commander level\", practically nearing the horde leader level! Thankfully, this hunter was already wounded when we engaged before, so we were able to give it another heavy wound\" said the captain of the tiger fang squad, a dark skinned, thin, short man in a small voice, \"As of now, we've already healed up and regained our strength! This time, we have to grab our chance and hunt down this 'Hunter' whose strength has declined greatly\".\"Yes, captain\"The six members of the tiger fang squad were full of fighting spirit! One dead hunter is practically worth more than one or two years of their income.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdOn the rooftop of one of the 21 story high residential hall in the blue sky sector.Five members of the fire hammer squad had their binoculars pointed down and were looking carefully. Luo Feng held his binocular with his left hand and his water bottle with his right. He drank a little bit of water, put the binoculars down, tightened up the cap of the water bottle and put it into his back. Only after that did he continue looking downwards with his binoculars again.\"Captain, do we just foolishly wait here?\" asked Luo Feng.\"What do you understand?\" Gao Feng laughed as he put down his binoculars, \"In this area, a 21 story high residential apartment is already pretty high. From the rooftop, we can scan a radius of 5 km with our binoculars. How big is a country level city? Of course, because some of the buildings are blocking, our efficiency isn't that high. However--this efficiency is already immensely high. Everybody can rest and find monsters. It's the best way.\"Luo Feng nodded.\"Captain, you guys come look here\" shouted Zhang Ke suddenly as he pointed down in a certain direction.WHOOSH!The other four ran there, each of them holding their binoculars and looking downwards. Luo Feng also looked towards the direction Zhang ke was pointing at, and through the binoculars he saw that there were horned boars and iron fur boars appearing in some of the streets in the north west direction. There was probably a total of a couple hundred boars, and the number of boars were still increasing in his field of view.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng's eyes flashed. On one of the streets, there was a peculiar monster that was moving slowly and calling upon more pig type monsters. It was completely red and looked like a tank.\"This is the Bloodthirsty Tank?\" said Luo Feng out of shock.Out of the pig type monsters, they are ranked at #2--Bloodthirsty Tank herd. It's called a bloodthirsty tank, but they're also a pig type monster. They have a large amount of scales on them and their defense is amazing. At a glance, it resembles an armored tank, and its defense and attack isn't inferior to a real tank at all.\"It's a bloodthirsty tank!\"\"Man it's a big catch\"\"Captain, according to the color of its scales, it should be around a 'low commander level monster'. Maybe nearing 'medium commander level'\".Some of the fire hammer squad members started arguing.\"Hm\"Hm, the price of a bloodthirsty tank is quite high\" laughed captain Gao Feng, \"even though it's only a low commander level monster, its price is comparable to medium commander level monsters. This is a great catch! Everybody cheer up\"\"Old Chen\"\"Chen Gu\"The captain's voice caused Chen Gu to finally open his eyes. Chen Gu laughed as he stood up, \"Yo guys, found a commander level monster?\"\"Come and look\" laughed Gao Feng.Chen Gu sprinted over and looked through the binoculars. He was astonished as he said: \"Damn, its the bloodthirsty tank that's ranked second in the pig type monsters. This guy's defense is crazy; the armor piercing bullets I brought probably wouldn't even be able to pierce through its scales! Looks like it's time to use my precious ones\".\"Hurry, bullets aren't worth that much\" persuaded Gao Feng.Chen Gu was quick; he immediately sprinted to the steel case, took out three blood-red colored bullets, and changed the bullets in the sniper rifle.\"PU!\"Chen Gu laid on the roof and set up his silverish gray heavy sniper rifle. The barrel of the gun reflected the light from the sun. And Chen Gu stuck out his hand to get a feel for the direction, and started doing detailed calculations as he calibrated his optical aimer device. The other five members of the fire hammer squad didn't dare make a sound.Suddenly--\"PENG!\" a deep sound full of force rang.In practically an instant, the bullet went through the air and shot through. Not only was the power of this alloyed armor piercing bullet destructively high, but its speed was also a couple times higher than the speed of sound. Because it was faster than the speed of sound, the sonic boom it causes is behind the bullet, which means that the sound won't reach the monster until after it has been hit by the bullet.The bloodthirsty tank walked slowly on the street, commanding large amounts of monsters.\"PU!\"The scales between the back of the ear and the neck instantaneously combusted, dramatically blowing up a hole as the bullet forced its way through.\"AO~~\" the bloodthirsty tank wailed in pain as it started staggering and swaying around. After it regained its balance, the bloodthirsty tank immediately howled in rage and bitterness over and over. In an instant, the large amounts of pig type monsters that were spread out immediately rushed towards it, and the spot where the bloodthirsty tank was hit started bleeding. It kept howling over and over, but it wasn't able to determine where the bullet was shot from.......On the roof, Chen Gu slightly raised his head and moved the optical aimer device away from his eye as he said confidently: \"My luck was pretty good, I hit its vital spot. This bloodthirsty boar didn't die instantly because its life force is strong, but it'll fall for sure within 5 minutes\". The first shot is the most effective shot in long ranged sniping because the commander level monster isn't prepared for it.However, if the first bullet fails to strike a vital point, then there'll be trouble.And a commander level monster has extremely high defense, so its pretty good if a bullet could just pierce through its armor. Because of that, bullets usually concentrate on high penetration powered 'armor piercing bullets' and not some of the destructive explosion bullets. If you can't even get through the armor, then what's the point of being destructive?\"Nice shooting\" laughed Zhang Ke as he gave a thumbs up.\"The skull of a bloodthirsty tank is extremely hard. Even if you get through the scales, the bloodthirsty tank isn't affected much\" laughed Gao Feng, \"Chen Gu, this gun is fantastic\". If Chen Gu failed, then they would have to kill all of the monsters guarding the bloodthirsty tank, which is too difficult!\"Don't praise me too much\"Chen Gu laughed: \"Now you guys have to think of a way to get the corpse of that bloodthirsty tank. There are hundreds of monsters surrounding it. And if we're too slow..... another fighter squad might steal our loot\".\"Don't jinx it, there are probably at most two or three fighter squads in this country level city\". Gao Feng laughed, \"Alright guys, let's tidy up and depart, to get the corpse down there\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Zhang Ke, go and carry one of Chen Gu's steel cases!\" commanded Gao Feng.\"Yes, captain\".Spear Zhang Ke headed towards Chen Gu, where Chen Gu was currently disassembling his heavy sniper rifle and putting it back into the wooden case. He put the wooden case and large amounts of ammunition into the steel case and handed it over to Zhang Ke. After that, Chen Gu opened the other steel case and took out a grim machine gun. He wrapped the bullet chains around himself and attached one of the ends to the machine gun.Luo Feng clicked his tongue after seeing such a sight and couldn't help but to be amazed.Heated weapons are usually only very effective against soldier level monsters. For example, there was luck involved in the one shot killing of the 'bloodthirsty tank'. With such a large body and tough skull, even if the bloodthirsty tank gets hit by a bullet, it usually doesn't affect it at all.So--There are very few spots where you can kill it in one hit. Like the eyes, right below the skullcap, and behind the ears. You have to be extremely accurate when shooting. One, you need skill, and second, you need luck. If the bloodthirsty tank was just a bit more cautious, or even if it just changed its direction, the shot would've missed.\"Go, go down\"After Gao Feng's command, Luo Feng and the others went down the staircase and quickly left the blue sky sector.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdFive minutes later, Luo Feng and the others were in a small alley. Wei Tie, who was leading, sneakily made a peek outside, and said as he turned his head: \"Captain, the bloodthirsty tank is down and dead\".\"Old Chen, damn nice\" Gao Feng gave a thumbs up.Chen Gu laughed.\"However, captain\" continued Wei Tie, \"there are at least a couple hundred monsters surrounding the body of the bloodthirsty tank. It's gonna be troublesome to retrieve the bloodthirsty tank's corpse\". This is the annoying part of killing a commander level monster with far ranged attacks. Even if you succeed, retrieving the valuable materials from the corpse is also very dangerous.However--It's much safer than killing the commander level monster in the herd of monsters.\"Same rules, Wei Tie and Wei Qing will distract the herd. When they're confused, we'll go\" commanded Gao Feng, and he turned his head towards Luo Feng.Luo Feng took a deep breath at this time. Charging at a couple hundred monsters in a herd is indeed the most dangerous situation he's been in so far with the fire hammer squad. Of course, according to the posts he read, these kinds of situations are one of the easier situations that fighter squads have to deal with. There are situations that are tens to hundreds of times more dangerous than this.\"Luo Feng, you wait next to Chen Gu. Your mission is to protect Chen Gu and not allow any monster to attack him\" commanded Gao Feng.\"Don't worry captain, I definitely won't let even one monster approach brother Chen\" nodded Luo Feng.Good, let's go!\"Gao Feng ordered.Whoosh! Whoosh!Two black lights came flying from the brothers Wei Tie and Wei Qing's hands, as if they were lightning. They flew for around a hundred meters and landed in the middle of the herd of monsters. These two black lights were actually two ellipse-shaped black balls. These ellipse-shaped black balls also had a red timer signal on them.The monsters that noticed this thing immediately got away in caution.Beep! Beep!\"BOOM~~\"The two timer bombs exploded ferociously. Flying fragments followed the powerful explosion, causing the two monsters beside them to fall with blood all over their bodies. At the same time, the bombs released large amounts of smokescreen, which quickly spread around in every direction.In terms of power, these two timer bombs only killed one monster by luck and harmed five or six of them. Most of the monsters were just affected by the smoke screen.\"Charge!\" commanded Gao Feng.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Luo Feng also exploded all the strength in his body, with his shield in one hand and his ghost blade in the other. He sprinted quickly and followed Chen Gu. The speed of all six members of the fire hammer squad was astonishing. They were around 150 meters away from the commander level monster's corpse in the herd and they got there in four or five seconds.And this was with a decreased speed from running into the middle of the herd.Captain Gao Feng moved like lightning and charged forwards. He was holding one of his heavy hammers in one of his hands and started swinging it, and only the two sounds \"PENG!\", \"PENG!\" were heard. Two of the soldier level monsters' heads immediately exploded after getting smashed. One side were the medium soldier level monsters and the other was the 'beginner level warlord' fighter whose strength neared an 'intermediate level warlord' fighter.The difference in strength was too big!He was holding his heavy hammer in one hand, but a dagger in the other. In almost an instant, he was next to the corpse of the 'bloodthirsty tank', and he rapidly stuck his dagger into the hole made by the bullet behind the bloodthirsty tank's ear. While Gao Feng was dissecting this corpse and getting the materials, the other five members of the fire hammer squad were in danger.\"Hurry, Luo Feng, protect old Chen well\" said Zhang Ke as he waved his spear.The brothers Wei Qing and Wei Tie were protecting Gao Feng. With the bloodthirsty tank's defense, if it was Wei Tie or Luo Feng dissecting it, a large amount of time would be needed. However, with Gao Feng's astonishing strength, half a minute is enough time.\"HOWL~~\"\"ROAR~~\"The surrounding monsters discovered Luo Feng and the others and started charging at them. It was like a heavy hummer charging at over 100 km/h at them.\"Get out\" with two skillful steps, Luo Feng smashed the shield in his left hand into the charging horned boar as he dodged, pushing the horned boar off balance. Its gigantic body fell over and shook the ground as it fell onto the already cracked concrete sidewalk, causing large amounts of dust to rise.Luo Feng didn't want to kill the enemy, he just wanted to survive for half a minute.\"XIU!\" \"XIU!\"Zhang Ke waved his spear, killing two soldier level monsters and beating down three of them. After that, those three enraged monsters howled and surrounded Zhang Ke as they charged at him. Zhang Ke didn't have a shield; he only used his one spear.\"Not good\", after slashing with his spear, Zhang Ke's face changed.\"ROAR~~\" the speed of an iron fur boar charging is at least 50 m/s. The size of its body is like a small truck, but its speed rivals a sports car's. And not only did Zhang Ke not have the time to block, but there were also three monsters surrounding him in front too.\"I'm going to receive a heavy wound this time\". Zhang Ke clenched his teeth.\"PENG!\"A shadow appeared from the side and it stomped on the charging iron fur's body. Doing so under such a high speed would cause you to lose a lot of control over your body. The iron fur boar also lost control after getting stomped and it directly fell over. However, it quickly crawled back up.\"Brother Zhang, let's hang on here\" said Luo Feng.\"Luo Feng, thanks!\" yelled Zhang Ke gratefully. If it wasn't for Luo Feng, Zhang Ke would've definitely received a heavy wound. Zhang Ke thought to himself: \"Letting Luo Feng join the fire hammer squad was indeed a good idea. And his steps are so quick and agile\".\"Great technique\" praised Chen Gu who was under protection.At this time, there were a couple hundred monsters in the herd, and the fight between Luo Feng and the few dozen at the beginning soon attracted many more monsters. Thankfully, the smoke screen blocked their vision and the herd hasn't been able to effectively bring out their full power.\"Not good, captain, hurry\"Wei Tie couldn't help but to yell.With every passing second, the fire hammer squad's situation worsens. The monsters surrounding them quickly increased in number.\"Chen Gu, fire!\" commanded Gao Feng who was squatting beside the bloodthirsty tank's corpse and being protected by the Wei Jia brothers.\"Yes\".Chen Gu licked his lips and smiled savagely. Luo Feng and Zhang Ke, who were beside Chen Gu, immediately stepped back. As Chen Gu pressed the trigger, \"TU TU TU~~~\" a stream of light sprayed out of the muzzle like crazy. Each and every bullet was an expensive armor piercing bullet that Chen Gu bought.They're even a bit threatening to a commander level monster.\"HOWL~\"In an instant, large amounts of monsters started howling in pain as the crazily shot armor piercing bullets started entering their bodies. These monsters were strong in vitality, so they usually don't die even after being shot. Only firing at their heads can you kill them in one shot! These armor piercing bullets won't go through a commander level monster's skull, but they usually have no problem with soldier level monsters.PENG! One of the monster's cerebrospinal liquid flew out.PU! One of the monsters that fell had another hole in its body.\"Haha..... die, die\" as if Chen Gu was going mad, ke-luo alloyed armor piercing bullets continuously streamed from the gun's muzzle. The bullets virtually suppressed a whole side of the herd. Luo Feng and Zhang Ke were stopping the other side of the monsters from attacking Chen Gu.As the gun fired, the monsters in the smokescreen were able to quickly determine the correct direction and charged madly.When fighting a herd, Chen Gu's skill with the machine gun makes one fighter equal around ten fighters! However, as the machine gun fires, it attracts the attention of other monsters.\"Okay, let's go\"Chen Gu, who finished harvesting the material, commanded in a low voice, which made Luo Feng and the others sigh in relief.Whoosh! Whoosh!The six members of the fire hammer squad started escaping.\"RUMBLE~~\" hundreds of enraged monsters started chasing them. One running monster is enough to shake the concrete earth. Hundreds of them running together made it seem like an earthquake was going on. The entire street and even the ruined homes and apartments beside them started shaking. They even gave off a rumbling echo.\"Herds sure are scary\" Luo Feng turned his head and looked back. The hundreds of monsters that were mad enough to almost go crazy were practically flying at them, so it was quite a startling scene.\"Over here\"The fire hammer squad immediately slipped into an alley. The alley was very narrow, so two monsters couldn't walk side by side at the same time; they could only enter one by one. Taking advantage of this, the fire hammer squad kept slipping into small alleys in the built-up areas. They soon shook off the entire herd of monsters.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdHalf an hour later.Luo Feng and the others quietly came to a roof of a hotel that was 18 stories high.\"Haha, everybody did a great job this time\" laughed captain Gao Feng, \"Chen Gu, that shot was brilliant. Luo Feng, you were great too, you saved Zhang Ke. Yup, this 'bloodthirsty tank' is a medium commander level monster, and it's one of the hardest medium commander level monsters to hunt. We sure made a bit of cash this time. I wouldn't have thought that we'd make this much on our first day; we sure got a ton right when we started. I estimate that as this month goes on, our income won't be small at all\".Luo Feng, Chen Gu, and the others all started laughing one by one.Luo Feng looked at his tactical communications watch and was startled: \"a phone call?\"Even if someone calls, this tactical communications watch won't distract the fighter. The fighter has to look at the watch himself to find out if someone called him.\"It's from home\" laughed Luo Feng, and he gave a voice command, \"Call back!\"\"Beep, beep, beep, beep.....\"The tactical communications watch called Luo Feng's home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Yo, bro\"Luo Feng couldn't help but to laugh after hearing the sound that came from the tactical communications watch: \"Luo Hua, weren't you heating things up with that young lady? How come you have the time to call me!\"\"Haha.....\"On the balcony, Chen Gu, Zhang Ke, and the others came one by one and started laughing.\"Even if I have a wife I can't forget my older brother\" laughed the younger brother in the tactical communications watch, \"Oh yea, bro. I called to tell you something. Nan officially agreed to be my girlfriend, haha..... isn't your brother great\"The younger brother laughed joyfully.How long has it been? He hasn't been this happy before.\"The power of love is indeed great\". Luo Feng thought to himself, \"He's been crippled for so long, so he has a lot of psychological pressure to deal with. For him to be so happy after getting a girlfriend......\" Luo Feng was happy for his brother, and immediately laughed: \"You still gotta work hard and get that certificate!\"\"Bro, we can't rush this. We gotta go step by step\" laughed Luo Hua.\"Oh yea, what about mom and dad?\" asked Luo Feng.\"They went grocery shopping\" answered Luo Hua.Luo Feng nodded.....Mom can finally go grocery shopping in the afternoon, and Dad can finally relax and spend time with Mom in the market.\"I'm fine bro. Be careful while you're out of the city\" said Luo Hua out of concern.\"No worries!\"After the call ended, Luo Feng had a smile all over his face.\"Alright, since Luo Feng is done with his phone call, everyone come here for a sec\" said Gao Feng. In a moment, Luo Feng and the others walked over, \"today, we just entered the city and produced great results! As always, we'll divide the spoils based on everyone's contribution in the battle!\"\"After we finish hunting and return to base to resupply, we'll do the dividing\". Suddenly, Gao Feng's expression became very serious, \"However, let me give a reminder, that everybody must be extremely cautious! This is an area with a high amount of buildings, where all the monsters' nests are. There will be a huge amount of commander level monsters in the entire city. So don't let your guards down, or else it'll be troublesome if any of you get into a dangerous situation. Many fighters died last year\".\"Yes\"Chen Gu, Zhang Ke, the Wei Jia brothers, and Luo Feng all nodded seriously.Luo Feng also knew.....That joining the army was the safest. The mortality rate of a fighter like him barging into the wilderness was extremely high!\"Everybody used up quite a bit of energy in the slaughter just now. We were also rushing through the night, so everybody rest now. After 4 PM, we'll move out!\" decided Gao Feng.\"Yes\"\"Phew, time to rest\"The six members of the fire hammer squad either leaned against something or laid down to rest.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdWhile the fire hammer squad was well-hidden and resting on the rooftop of the hotel, the tiger fang squad already entered the #0201 country level city. The six of them were carefully moving throughout the alleys of the ruined city. Some of the alleys' walls were collapsed, and some even had corpses of monsters in them.\"Halt!\" the skinny captain rose his hand and everyone else stopped.The captain of the tiger fang squad said in a small voice: \"Everyone listen up, we only have one target this time--the already injured silver moon wolf! So while we're here in the city, make sure you don't mess with any of the other monsters! If you can hide, hide. If you can run, run. Try not to fight them, and it'll be troublesome if you get injured!\"The other five members nodded seriously.This is a \"high level commander level\" silver moon wolf. The amount of money you could make is even greater than hunting dozens of low level commander level monsters.\"Also..... once we catch up to the silver moon wolf! This silver moon wolf is extremely wounded, so we only need to hit it two or three more times to kill it. So never try to fight it head on. Let me remind you guys again, do not, DO NOT try to fight it head on and drag it out! If we really start fighting this silver moon wolf with everything, at least one or two of us will lose our lives!\"Everyone nodded their heads with serious expressions on their faces.A high level commander level monster, and the king of the wolves: 'silver moon wolf'. Even when injured, if it stakes its life for revenge, it's possible that most of the tiger fang squad will get killed.\"We just have to keep injuring it and let it bleed; torture it to death!\" laughed the captain of the tiger fang squad with confidence, \"A country level area like this has a very low chance of attracting a wargod fighter squad. There are probably just a few teams in this city, and with a team like ours, we should be the strongest ones in the city. So we don't need to worry about someone stealing it away!\"Usually, stronger warlord level fighter teams are more active in the urban level areas. There's more of a challenge, and there are more independent commander level monsters!For example, there's a reason why the fire hammer squad came to this country level area. And that's because--Luo Feng is a rookie!Otherwise, the fire hammer squad would also enter an urban level area, and not a country level area.\"Captain, if there actually is a fighter squad that actually tries to steal.....\" said the one eyed middle aged man as he wrinkled his eyebrows.\"Relax\"Zhang Ze Hu laughed on the side, \"Even we don't dare to stick too close to that hunter! And most of the fighter squads in this city are warrior level! One warlord level fighter squad would already be pretty good. And if they try to fight the silver moon wolf? They'll probably get torn to pieces immediately by the silver moon wolf\".\"Yup\"The captain of the tiger fang squad nodded, \"They don't have the ability to steal the silver moon wolf away. If they do..... kill them!\"\"Yes!\"The other five nodded.\"Let's go\" the captain of the tiger fang squad waved his hand and the six of them swiftly moved forward silently.The wilderness isn't like a headquarter!Headquarters are cities controlled by humans, where there's law! Where there's a government!But in the wilderness, monsters rule the area. Here, dark, chaotic, and bloody cases are everywhere. For a prized corpse of a monster, there are many cases where fighter squads have killed each other over it! Of course, most of the time it's a stronger fighter squad stealing from a weaker fighter squad.Many fighters in the wilderness die to monsters. However, quite a few fighters die to other fighters too.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdMidnight. The six members of the fire hammer squad ate a lot and were well rested, and all of them looked through their binoculars and had them pointing downwards.\"We already saw two commander level monsters in two hours\" said Wei Tie helplessly, \"Sadly, each of them have a gigantic amount of soldier level monsters surrounding them! Looks like the urban areas are still better. Even though there are many commander level monsters, and sometimes even a 'horde leader level' monster there... Most of the regular soldier level monsters are all focused around the horde leader level monsters and the powerful commander level monsters. Many of the commander level monsters are independent\".Before, Chen Gu had fired two shots from his sniper rifle!However, they didn't get so lucky this time.These two shots were fired at the two commander level monsters. One of them barely had any effect at all, and while the other one was heavily wounded, it didn't die! Most importantly, they have tons of soldier level monsters protecting them.\"That's the bad point of a country level city. Even a regular commander level monster has a huge amount of monsters under its control\" sighed Zhang Ke.\"However, country level cities are safe\"Gao Feng laughed, \"Out of the entire country level city, there are only one or two high level commander level monsters. And all of them are surrounded by a gigantic amount of normal monsters, so we wouldn't even touch them. As for the regular monster hordes, with our squad's strength, we can wipe them out if we really wanted to! We aren't afraid of suddenly getting surrounded by a few commander level monsters\".In the cities, there are many commander level monsters, so it's easy to get surrounded by several of them.\"Hm?\"Luo Feng looked through his binoculars, \"This, this is a commander level monster?\"Around ten monsters appeared on the edge of the street, and all of them had spots. They gave off the feeling of a tiger, the 'ocelot race' of the cat type monsters. All of these ocelots had large bodies, and one of them even had two tails!\"Two tails? Commander level?\" said Luo Feng excitedly.In the ocelot race, two tails means a low level commander, three tails means a medium level commander..... five tails, low level horde leader..... seven tails, high level horde leader...... eight tails, already surpassing the horde leader level, and is one of the strongest existences in the ocelot race.And out of all the cat type animals, nine tails..... is the Nine Lives Demon Cat (Nine Lives Cat King), which is one of the most horrifying monsters on earth.\"Captain, look, a commander level ocelot\" yelled Luo Feng.\"Ocelot?\"In a moment, the other five rushed over and looked for it with their binoculars.\"It's really an ocelot! Looks like the fact that ocelots don't like large groups isn't just a rumor. There are only 16 regular soldier level monsters surrounding the commander level ocelot\" laughed Gao Feng, \"Guys, get ready for action\".\"Only 16 regular monsters, I can handle them alone\" laughed Chen Gu, so all the other members were relaxed.\"Let's go!\"Under Gao Feng's command, Luo Feng and the others left the rooftop one by one. This time, they didn't fire in advance..... for if they fail to kill the ocelot, it might run away! For a commander level monster to only have around a dozen monsters with it is very rare in a small country level city.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Feng followed the five veteran members of the fire hammer squad as they quietly went over the wall and into a residential home on the side of the street. The walls of this residential home were mostly collapsed, the corners of the walls that were left had moss growing all over them, and the concrete walkway has been covered with weeds ages ago.\"The fat sheep is ahead\". Wei Tie went through a gap in the collapsed wall and looked around on the street outside, \"We're pretty lucky. This ocelot is searching for prey with its underlings in a relaxed manner\".Luo Feng also looked outside through the gap in the collapsed wall.Around 50 meters away, the commander level ocelot was leading its group of ocelots on the street.\"Remember guys\"Gao Feng said in a small voice, \"First, your mission is to kill those regular ocelots. As for the commander level ocelot, just stay away from it and try not to get hit. Just leave it to me. If it's one low level commander level ocelot, I can handle it alone. Next, Chen Gu, don't fire your machine gun. It's not too late to fire until after something unexpected happens..... once you start firing, we'll have to flee the battlefield\".\"Understood\"Luo Feng and the others nodded seriously.Gunshots attract monsters easily. If you're on the rooftop of a high building, then the monsters can't pinpoint your position with just their ears. However, shooting on the ground exposes your position easily. Soon after, large amounts of monsters will be attracted and will surround and attack. As time goes on, more and more monsters will keep getting attracted.Last time, when they were trying to retrieve the corpse of the 'bloodthirsty tank', everyone started running for their lives once Chen Gu started firing.\"Alright, this time we're gonna make this quick! Let's go!\" Gao Feng waved his hand.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Six shadows flew out at practically the same time, and even Chen Gu had a machine gun in his left hand and a short dagger in his right.Six people, as if six blurred images, all charged at the group of ocelots.\"ROAR~~\" the hairs of the two tailed ocelot, head of the ocelot group, all stood up and it immediately roared out of anger. The 16 surrounding ocelots also started to give out an enraged roar one by one. These roars kept echoing between the two sides of the streets and the sound shook the sky. Each of the strong, burly ocelots crazily charged at the humans in front of their eyes.\"Kill!\"\"Scum, die!\"Luo Feng watched the ocelot fly towards him like lightning, and stepped a meter away to the side. The ghost blade in his hand used this position to draw a cold light that went straight for the throat of the ocelot! The charging ocelot growled in a low voice and lowered its head to use its chin to block Luo Feng's attack!\"CHI!\"The ghost blade cut the fur of the ocelot's chin and even cut half a cm into the jawbone.\"This ocelot reacts quickly, much faster than the lion mastiff monsters\" when Luo Feng landed, a blood scented wind came as another ocelot's mouth was already wide open and ready to bite Luo Feng. Luo Feng first stepped back for some more space and then directly used his shield to block and his blade to stab!The ghost blade delicately slid across the shield and stabbed through the charging ocelot's chin in an instant.Luo Feng ferociously pulled his blade out and stepped back.\"Pu~~~\" fresh blood sprayed wildly, and the large ocelot fell to the ground. It swayed three times and then fell down to the cracked concrete floor with a howl.\"Watch out!\"A huge voice suddenly shouted![KUANG]The nearby brothers Wei Tie and Wei Qing were suddenly hit and thrown into the air. Wei Tie's entire body smashed against one of the walls on the street and, with a boom, the poorly maintained wall instantly shattered. Wei Tie fell down and spit out a mouthful of fresh blood.\"ROAR~~\" the twin tailed cat that instantly smashed into the brothers Wei Tie and Wei Qing was in front of Luo Feng at almost the same time.\"Too fast!\" Luo Feng was startled and instantly side stepped.\"Just barely!\"Clearly, his dodging speed wasn't fast enough, and as he saw the claws of the twin tailed ocelot about to latch onto himself, he used his shapeless spiritual force to move himself away. The speed of his sidestepped increased by a significant amount and the twin tailed ocelot's claws just barely touched him.\"CHI!\"Luo Feng also used this chance to unleash an uppercut! The blade slashed against one of the twin tailed ocelot's forelimbs, but the sharp blade actually made a \"CHI\" sound as it slashed against the fur. It couldn't even break through a single layer of fur on the twin tailed ocelot's front claw.\"The speed and defense of a commander level monster is just too horrifying\" said Luo Feng out of shock.\"PUCHI!\" The twin tailed ocelot landed on the ground and its sharp claws caused the concrete floor to crack open.\"SCUM!!!\" Gao Feng, whose carelessness led to his comrades' injuries, rushed like lightning and ferociously rammed towards the twin tailed ocelot with a hideous look on his face. The two gigantic, heavy hammers spun like a windmill as they smashed into the twin tailed ocelot. The twin tailed ocelot, completely unaffected by Luo Feng's blade, turned towards Gao Feng like a huge truck and rushed towards him!\"PENG\" \"PENG\"The hammers and the claws clashed.Both Gao Feng and the twin tailed ocelot staggered, but Gao Feng used his left foot to charge at the twin tailed ocelot again. Gao Feng gave the twin tailed ocelot no chance to attack his comrades again! And the bones in one of the twin tailed ocelot's limb were fractured by the heavy hammer, so it could only rely on three of its legs to stand.In their struggle, it seems that Gao Feng has the advantage!RUMBLE~~ The heavy hammers kept smashing!......On the rooftop of a six story residential building around five hundred meters away from this scene, the six members of the tiger fang squad were using their binoculars to look around.\"Captain, it seems that there are quite a bit of monsters around, so it'll be difficult to not agitate any monsters within a ten mile radius of the location of 'the hunter'\" said the one eyed middle aged man as he frowned. The skinny captain of the tiger fang squad also frowned. Suddenly, his gaze landed upon the fire hammer squad that was battling the ocelot monsters far away.\"It's the fire hammer squad\" said the captain of the tiger fang squad as he raised his eyebrows, \"They came to this country level city too?\"\"The fire hammer squad probably did this because they brought that rookie Luo Feng\" said the one eyed middle aged man, \"The guy with the twin hammers is clearly Gao Feng. Gao Feng sure is powerful, he's going at it with a low level commander level monster. I heard that his strength is already at the level of an intermediate warlord, but it's just that his speed is a bit lacking. Seems like they weren't just rumors\".Carrying a gigantic machete on his back, Zhang Ze Hu's eyes flashed. He grabbed his binoculars and looked towards that direction and said joyfully, \"It actually is the fire hammer squad, and that Luo Feng kid is actually here. Seems like he's performing well!\". A savage light passed through Zhang Ze Hu's eyes.\"Captain, it's this tiny rabbit that made me lose a whole one hundred million!\" said Zhang Ze Hu, \"Let's use this chance to kill him\". One hundred million was a large sum of money to Zhang Ze Hu. Since he's only at the advanced warrior level, he has to risk his life for two years to earn one hundred million.\"Kill him?\"The other members of the squad were slightly surprised.The captain of the tiger fang squad frowned, and then laughed: \"Good idea! Xiao, Dong, you two use your snipers to deal with the most important members of the fire hammer squad, and then immediately fire at the two monster hordes near them! We're far away, so the monsters won't be able to tell where the sudden shot came from\".\"These normal monsters have very low intelligence: once they get hit, they'll only attack the humans they can see!\"The captain of the tiger fang squad laughed coldly, \"At that time, the two monster hordes will be attracted to the fire hammer squad and will surround them! The gigantic slaughter will attract large amounts of monsters over there, which will lower the amount of monsters in the other areas. When that happens, we can easily go through miles of land!\".The other members of the tiger fang squad were silent.It's not like they haven't killed other fighters before. But they usually only did that to steal monsters' corpses, but to just do it in this case..........\"Dong, aim on that Luo Feng and kill him in one shot to relieve my brother\" said Zhang Ze Hu as he clenched his teeth.\"Do it!\" ordered the captain of the tiger fang squad.\"Yes, captain\".The two heated weapon using members didn't delay. On the border of life and death, they had too much experience killing monsters and humans.\"Hmph hmph, Luo Feng\" Zhang Ze Hu stood on the edge of the rooftop as he watched the fire hammer squad that already succeeded in killing the twin tailed ocelot. He let out a cold smile as he said, \"You dare mess with my money, I'll take your life! Go regret it in hell!\".And the two sniper rifles were already set up.The two heated weapon using members were in front of their sniper rifles, and they chose to use a special, powerful armor piercing round. They started to aim and adjust for elevation, etc. and then they nodded to their captain, showing they're ready.\"HU!\" the captain of the tiger fang squad waved his hand.The two members pressed the triggers simultaneously!\"PENG!\"\"PENG!\"The two low sounds rang and the two bullets instantly split through the space and headed towards the fire hammer squad that was currently getting the material from the twin tailed ocelot's corpse. The sound rang, but the bullets moved at a couple times faster than the speed of sound, so the bullets arrived before the fire hammer squad could even hear anything!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With a \"CHI\" sound of Luo Feng's ghost blade, it drew across the tail and took out the transparent tendon. Luo Feng looked at Wei Tie beside him and laughed, \"Brother Tie sure is strong. With that collision with the twin tailed ocelot just now, brother Tie was spitting out blood. It scared me, but it seems like brother Tie is perfectly fine now!\"\"Are you stupid? Should I just force the blood back down instead of spitting it out? The damage will be even worse that way!\" said Wei Tie jokingly as he laughed.\"Alright, let's get these one by one\" laughed Chen Gu.The six members of the fire hammer squad were in quite a good mood. Gao Feng squatted next to the twin tailed ocelot while dissecting it. Of course, the twin tailed ocelot's corpse was the hardest to dissect.\"Luo Feng brought luck to our squad. It's our first day and we killed two commander level monsters in a row\" laughed Gao Feng as he dissected.\"Haha, captain, you gotta praise me for that. It was me who tried to get Luo Feng in our squad\" laughed Chen Gu.The group laughed merrily.\"Hm?\"As if Luo Feng's tail was on fire, his eyes instantly widened. It was as if the conditions were exactly the same as his reaction speed examination where he dodged the rubber bullets:--the air was hazy in front of him and a bullet could be seen!The speed of the bullet was at least 10 times faster than the rubber bullets used in the reaction speed examination! Luo Feng didn't even have time to yell out a warning.Under immense stress, Luo Feng's body instantly started pumping out adrenaline, and his heart started beating at an alarming rate. All the hairs on his body stood up and his mind was pushed to a limit never seen before! Even the spiritual force that was sleeping deep within him spread out across his entire body automatically!A life or death situation!Human's innate survival instinct caused Luo Feng's body and spiritual force to instantly reach their limit!\"PU!\"The armor piercing bullet tore through the air and shot towards Luo Feng's brain.Luo Feng used the ghost blade that was dissecting the ocelot's tail to block the bullet. He pushed his body to its limit and used all of his power to swing his blade around. While his waist exerted its first force, it actually had time to exert a second force!Everything fell into place! Facing death, his body was able to naturally exert the second force while his concentration and body were at their limits.Nine Stage Thunder Blade--First Stage!It actually worked!The speed of the ghost blade instantly flew up!\"Accelerate!\" Luo Feng used his spiritual force on his ghost blade to make it move even faster!\"Decelerate!\"Without delay, the spiritual force was used on the armor piercing bullet that was flying towards him at an extreme speed. The armor piercing bullet was reduced to mach 1 from mach 4! And with a \"CLANG!\", Luo Feng's ghost blade directly hit the armor piercing bullet.The tip of the armor piercing bullet pushed into the blade and then bounced off.\"PENG!\"The other armor piercing bullet was aimed at captain 'Gao Feng's' brain. According to the tiger fang squad's plan, Zhang Ze Hu requested to kill Luo Feng, while the other bullet was prepared for the strongest member of the fire hammer squad, Gao Feng. So these two bullets were prepared for Luo Feng and Gao Feng!And Gao Feng, who was currently dissecting the twin tailed ocelot and had his back turned towards the bullet, didn't see the armor piercing bullet at all.\"PU!\" the dagger in Gao Feng's hand ferociously cut through the fur of the twin tailed ocelot. This force made his body sway, and the bullet that was aimed for his brain got off target. Right when he was about to feel the toughness of the ocelot's fur--HU!The super fast armor piercing bullet just barely grazed Gao Feng's ear as it flew by. The rapid airflow caused Gao Feng's ear to start bleeding.\"PENG!\"The armor piercing bullet cruelly landed in Zhang Ke's shoulder, who was beside Gao Feng. And the shot that is able to burst open a low level commander level monster's scales instantly shattered the bones and muscles in Zhang Ke's shoulder. With a BOOM, Zhang Ke's right shoulder directly flew up, and, \"PU-CHI\", the blood started spraying out like a fountain.\"AHH!\" Zhang Ke cried out bitterly.\"A sniper rifle bullet!\"Gao Feng looked at Zhang Ke's broken shoulder spraying out fresh blood. Some of the blood even sprayed onto Gao Feng, which caused Gao Feng's eyes to turn red. He howled: \"Enemy attack!\".\"Which bastard!\" Wei Tie and Wei Qing also yelled angrily.While they yelled out of rage, virtually all the members of the fire hammer squad started moving around quickly. There's no one who would dare to stand in the same location while being aimed at by a sniper. Gao Feng was only able to dodge the bullet because, by chance, his dagger made his body sway.\"PENG!\" \"PENG!\" \"PENG!\" \"PENG!\"Four more gunshots!\"That way!\" Gao Feng, Luo Feng, and the others all looked towards the gunshots' source with red eyes.On the rooftop far away, the shadows swayed and disappeared.\"It's the tiger fang squad!\" Gao Feng clenched his teeth, \"TIGER FANG!!!\".Luo Feng wasn't able to see them at all..... the distance was too great and the tiger fang squad vanished instantly. Clearly, your eyesight would need to be amazing to see them clearly! A fighter's sight and hearing improves along with their body fitness level. Within the six members of the fire hammer squad, captain Gao Feng's body fitness level neared 'intermediate level warlord'.So only he was able to see them clearly.\"The tiger fang squad? The tiger fang squad that Zhang Ze Hu is in?\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to feel his rage come up. Of course, he checked before and discovered the news about Zhang Ze Hu being in the tiger fang squad, \"he actually wants to kill me?\".Ice cold!Luo Feng truly felt for himself that fighters don't live in harmony with each other!\"Zhang Ke!\"\"Old Zhang!\"A couple of them went over, and Luo Feng rushed towards Zhang Ke's side too. Zhang Ke laid on the ground with a pale face. His right shoulder was completely shattered by the armor piercing bullet, and his right arm was blown off a while ago. Even his battle uniform was ripped up. The power of this bullet was just too great. Zhang ke's face was completely pale while Chen Gu hurriedly tried to stop the blood.\"It's me, Zhang Ke, you took this shot for me!\" said Gao Feng as he clutched his ear.\"Brother Zhang\" Luo Feng's fists were both clenched and his eyes were crimson red.It was brother Zhang and brother Chen that brought him into the fire hammer squad.\"Not good!\" Gao Feng's face changed completely, \"Run now!\"The tiger fang squad shot out a total of six bullets just now. Two of them were for Luo Feng and Gao Feng, while the other four were for the surrounding monsters. At this moment, the monsters were already starting to angrily howl, and everyone in the fire hammer squad immediately understood why the tiger fang squad shot those extra four bullets.\"So sinister\"\"They want to kill all of us\"\"Hurry and run\"Wei Qing put Zhang Ke, who lost too much blood, on his back, and the group started sprinting.\"RUMBLE~~\" a large amount of iron fur boars appeared on the street ahead. Each of the iron fur boars were gigantic, and a couple hundred of them were rushing towards the fire hammer squad. It seemed like an earthquake was going on when the boars were rushing together. All the faces of the members of the fire hammer squad lost their color, and right when they tried to change direction, another gigantic rumbling sound came from the other side.An even more alarming amount of monsters were rushing towards them. Not only were there horned boars in this horde, but also lion mastiff monsters. All of the monsters added up exceeded 1000.\"Big trouble\"All the members of the fire hammer squad were pale!\"Get over the wall!\" commanded Gao Feng.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!The fire hammer squad speedily rushed over the broken wall. The four sniper rifle bullets enraged the monsters greatly. The monsters only knew..... that only humans could have such a horrifyingly sinister assassination weapon! When they saw the humans rush over the wall, all of them were practically united--\"RUMBLE~~\" the horned boars lowered their heads and rammed into the wall. The wall that has been exposed to decades of wind and sun shattered instantly and over a thousand tightly packed monsters rushed over it.The fire hammer squad looked back and couldn't help but to have their faces change again.\"Brothers, this time it's everyone for themselves. Run, if one can survive, then at least that's one. If we stay together, all of us will die for sure!\" yelled Gao Feng, whose eyes were still red, as they ran, \"this son of a bitch tiger fang squad, if I, Gao Feng, live through this, I'll definitely make them pay for this with their blood!!!\"\"Everyone, spread out and escape!\" Wei Tie and Wei Qing were also clenching their teeth.Against over a thousand monsters, even an advanced warrior would have trouble escaping.\"The tiger fang squad, Zhang Ze Hu!\" Luo Feng felt in his heart that they probably did this because he made Zhang Ze Hu lose one hundred million that time, \"The tiger fang squad wouldn't just attack for no reason would they? Could it be because of me..... because of me, brother Zhang ended up like that?\"Guilt rushed out of Luo feng's heart, but also his intent to kill!!!\"Zhang Ze Hu! Tiger fang squad!\" both of Luo Feng's eyes were crimson red.\"Captain, brother Chen\" yelled Luo Feng.This yell caused captain Gao Feng, the Wei Jia brothers, and Chen Gu to look at Luo Feng in shock. Luo Feng clenched his teeth as he yelled, \"Follow me! Everyone can escape alive!!!\". With a \"HU\" sound, all of the throwing knives on Luo Feng's thigh started hovering up and encircled Luo Feng one by one.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Splitting up and running away was their last string of hope. However, Gao Feng, the Wei Jia brothers, Chen Gu, and Zhang Ke now watched the six throwing knives hovering around Luo Feng's body. Each and every one of them were dumbfounded. Chen Gu even abruptly blinked twice to make sure he was seeing this right..... these throwing knives were indeed floating without being attached to anything!\"Spirit reader!\"\"Telekinesis!\"\"Luo Feng is a spirit reader?\"All of these thoughts appeared in the minds of Gao Feng and the others. All of them became flustered with their faces completely red. Gao Feng then shouted out: \"Listen to Luo Feng, follow him!\"\"RUMBLE~~~\" the enraged horde of monsters came sprinting at them, causing the ruined concrete ground to split open. The rumbling caused the ruined buildings on the side to crumble. There's an old saying: Ten thousand horses galloping*. However, each and every one of these monsters are hundreds of times stronger and larger than a war horse. A thousand of them running is even scarier than ten thousand horses running.*TL note: original phrase: \ufffdf\ufffdR\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdv\"To the left!\" yelled Luo Feng.The other members of the fire hammer squad immediately followed Luo Feng, ferociously turning to the left. Wei Qing was still carrying Zhang Ke who had lost too much blood.\"ROAR~\"\"HOWL~\"......The stench of the monsters slowly emanated. Since they ran towards the left instead of running away, Luo Feng and his group ran into the monsters chasing them. Their stench was virtually stuck in their noses. At this time, Luo Feng clenched his teeth, and with a cold gaze, the six throwing knives encircling him in a 10 meter radius instantly moved!Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!The six throwing knives instantly caused a mirage. \"PUCHI!\" A throwing knife directly went through the head of one of the lion mastiff monsters that was running at them. Some of its cerebrospinal fluid came out with the throwing knife. The throwing knives, under the control of spiritual force, continued to go through more and more monsters' skulls with amazing speed!Six throwing knives! In a blink of an eye, the 30 or so nearest monsters were killed!Fresh blood and cerebrospinal juice flew out.\"HOWL~~\"\"RUMBLE~~\" under the howling of the monsters, the 30 or so monsters that were chasing after the fire hammer squad all fell while they were sprinting. When they fell, they ended up sliding around ten meters against the ground. Behind the fire hammer squad that was running away were large amounts of monsters' corpses.Gao Feng, Chen Gu, the Wei Jia brothers, and even the pale Zhang Ke were all stunned.They knew that spirit readers were strong, but..... this is just too absurd!The six throwing knives became flowing mirages one by one. The throwing knives go through the skull of any monster that enters a 20 meter radius within them. This precise control is also very frightening!\"I'm using up my spiritual force too quickly like this\". Luo Feng was also shocked. Every time a throwing knife goes through a monster's head, he uses up quite a bit of energy. The skulls of these monsters are much harder than regular stones. Now that he killed around 50 monsters in one breath, a large amount of spiritual force was used up.Chen Gu, who was behind Luo Feng, yelled out of disbelief: \"DAMN, this spirit reader is too insane. Even if there's a thousand monsters, he could probably kill them all!\"\"Stop wasting your breath. In this kind of situation, more and more monsters get attracted as time goes on! Right now there's around a thousand, but soon there'll be five thousand monsters coming for us. After even more time, there could even be ten thousand monsters coming after us. There'll even be quite a bit of commander level monsters in there too! How do you think the spirit reader will kill those? You think that a spirit reader doesn't need to expend spiritual force to kill monsters?\" laughed Gao Feng as he snapped.The fire hammer squad actually had the mood to chat while being chased by a horde of monsters.One could imagine..... that Gao Feng, Chen Gu, and the others weren't under much pressure anymore, since all the monsters that approached were killed by the dancing throwing knives.\"Go over the wall\" commanded Luo Feng.The sprinting fire hammer squad reached the wall in front, and each of them jumped over it one by one. Even though quite a bit of monsters died, the rest of the enraged monsters didn't fear death and kept charging. However, every monster that approached the territory of Luo Feng's throwing knives had their head pierced!Know that--Luo Feng's current body fitness level barely reaches the borders of an 'advanced warrior level'. Since spiritual force raises your level by two stages, then he currently barely reaches the 'intermediate warlord level' with his spiritual force. Spirit readers are the most terrifying existences within fighters: they can easily and completely destroy an existence of the same level!With his telekinesis, Luo Feng can stab monsters to death with his throwing knives from a far distance!However, for the knives to reach maximum power, the current Luo Feng can only use two throwing knives! As the number of throwing knives increase, the weaker each of them will be. Indeed, Luo Feng could technically use over a hundred throwing knives. However, not only will they be weak, but even their accuracy cannot be guaranteed.With six throwing knives, Luo Feng can guarantee that each of them can deal with a 'low level commander', and their accuracy can be guaranteed too.With two throwing knives, Luo Feng can guarantee that at their max power, they can deal with a 'medium level commander'.\"RUMBLE~~\" the fearless monsters smashed the wall.PUCHI! PUCHI!The monsters that got closer to the sprinting fire hammer squad were all killed. Their fresh blood and cerebrospinal fluid flew out and their corpses caused disorder in the horde behind them. The fire hammer squad was able to shake off quite a bit of monsters as they turned into the far away alley.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdBy this time, the tiger fang squad has already ran far away. With the fire hammer squad attracting most of the monsters, there were barely any monsters in their surroundings. Thanks to that, they were able to move across a great distance without much trouble. As they entered a new area with many monsters, the tiger fang squad slowed down and, once again, started moving cautiously.\"What happened just now, not even one of them died?\" asked the tiger fang squad's captain as he frowned.\"Captain, I fired at the captain of the fire hammer squad, Gao Feng. However, Gao Feng just so happened to be dissecting a corpse, and just so happened to use his dagger in a way that shook his body. With that, the bullet just barely missed him and injured another member of the fire hammer squad instead. That member's arm was instantly blasted off, but I'm not sure if he's alive or dead\" said Xiao, who had a skinny figure.\"That Gao Feng got lucky\"Zhang Ze Hu frowned as he looked at the other person, \"Dong Zi, I asked you to kill Luo Feng, how come he didn't die?\"With the great distance and the speed of the bullet, only the person using the sniper rifle with their laser aimer device could clearly see what happened in that instant.\"That Luo Feng.....\" the sniper named 'Dong Zi' hesitated, and then said, \"he also got lucky. As I fired, he just so happened to be skinning a monster, and just so happened to swing his blade against my armor piercing bullet\". Dong could only say this, because he didn't think Luo Feng's reaction speed was quick enough to cut through the armor piercing bullet.So the only explanation was luck!Since you would need an absurd control over your blade and amazing sight to be able to cut through an armor piercing bullet.\"Fuck, this Luo Feng also has some bullshit luck\". Zhang Ze Hu couldn't help but to curse.\"However, don't worry\". laughed the sniper 'Dong Zi', \"we fired four shots at the monster hordes before and the only humans they could find are the members of the 'fire hammer squad'. Over a thousand monsters have them surrounded. No matter how great the fire hammer squad is, they're doomed for sure!\"\"No!\"The captain of the tiger fang squad shook his head, \"Not absolutely. If the fire hammer squad split up and ran, one or two of them could survive!\" as he said that, the tiger fang squad let out a smile, \"Of course, one or two of them have absolutely no threat to our tiger fang squad\".\"Captain, maybe they could coincidentally meet a wargod level existence that could save them\" laughed the one eyed middle aged man.\"In this city, and in such a small amount of time, to meet a wargod..... and to even convince him to help them. The chance of this is even lower than winning the lottery\" grinned the tiger fang squad's captain as he laughed, \"Alright, let's go guys. That old thing is still moving, so we should get there as fast as possible\".\"Yes\".The tiger fang squad moved forward.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdLuo Feng and the others rushed to the rooftop of a regular six story residential apartment.\"KA!\" the door to the staircase connected to the rooftop was directly sealed shut.\"Quick, let old Zhang lie down\" said Chen Gu.\"Get the medicine\" said Gao Feng hurriedly.With Zhang Ke's injury, he could die just by blood loss. Thankfully they stopped the blood earlier. However, such a large injury would need some basic treatment first..... since this #0201 country level city is a three day walk away from the military resupplying base.And rushing on the road for three days? With Zhang Ke's current condition, there's no way he'd be able to handle that.\"Old Zhang, keep that in your mouth and replenish some energy\" Chen Gu took out a pill and put it in Zhang Ke's mouth.\"Wei Tie, seriously treat Zhang Ke's wound\" commanded Gao Feng.As the fire hammer squad continued to treat Zhang Ke, the pale faced Zhang Ke was able to get the energy he needed in time. As treatment went on, the members of the fire hammer squad started to loosen up.\"Phew\" Luo Feng secretly let out a sigh of relief. As he looked at the pale brother Zhang, and especially at the spot of his nonexistent right arm and half of a shoulder, he felt immensely guilty, \"Zhang Ke can't use a spear in the future anymore and his career as a fighter is over!\". Luo Feng felt that there was an 80-90% chance that the tiger fang squad did this because of him.As he looked at brother Zhang, he felt extremely guilty.\"Tiger fang squad! Zhang Ze Hu!\" Luo Feng's heart was burning, \"I, Luo Feng, swear that I'll take an eye for an eye and let you know the taste of being destroyed!!!\".\"Tiger fang squad, these pieces of trash, want to destroy our entire fire hammer squad huh\" Chen Gu couldn't help but to curse.\"Fucking tiger fang squad, we must have our revenge!\" Wei Tie also roared.\"These bastards, I, Gao Feng, will make them regret it\" said Gao Feng as he clenched both of his fists, and then looked at Luo Feng, \"Thankfully, Luo Feng was with us this time so we were able to...... Oh yea, Luo Feng, how come you can move objects without touching them?\".Suddenly, all the other members of the fire hammer squad, including the heavily wounded Zhang Ke that was lying on the floor, looked at Luo Feng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Alright, I'll admit it.....\" Luo Feng let out a helpless smile, \"I'm a spirit reader!\"\"Haha\" laughed Chen Gu loudly, \"Luo Feng, I knew I didn't misjudge you\"Wei Qing and Wei Tie also let out smiles.\"A spirit reader... a spirit reader has also appeared in our fire hammer squad\" laughed Gao Feng as he nodded, \"I know that if the tiger fang squad knew that Luo Feng was this powerful, they wouldn't have pulled this sly trick. If they knew...... that they made an enemy out of a spirit reader, they'd certainly regret it!\"\"They would regret it for life\" chuckled Wei Tie.Zhang Ke, who was lying off to the side, couldn't help but to say: \"The most powerful members of the trashes in the tiger fang squad are just those two intermediate level warlords! With Luo Feng's current fitness level, he barely reaches the 'advanced warrior level'. According to the rules, a spirit reader is two levels above his fitness level, so he should be stepping into the 'intermediate warlord level'. However..... an intermediate warlord level spirit reader would decimate an existence of the same level, so they can fight a fighter a level above them!\"All fighters understood the terror of a spirit reader!On the same level, they would certainly destroy any other fighter!No matter how good your blade technique, shielding technique, or body techniques are, a spirit reader could attack with their controlled throwing knives from far away. The throwing knives can even instantly change direction and fly faster than the speed of sound. How can a fighter of the same level compete at all?\"Just Luo Feng alone can destroy the entire tiger fang squad!\" grinned Chen Gu as he laughed, \"Messing with the fire hammer squad is the most foolish thing the tiger fang squad has ever done!\".\"This time, we really got lucky\" sighed Gao Feng.Gao Feng's fitness level barely reaches the 'intermediate warlord level', but in front of a horde of monsters, he was helpless. This is the difference between a regular fighter and a spirit reader!\"Brother Zhang\"Luo Feng squatted in front of Zhang Ke and said in a small voice as he looked at Zhang Ke's pale face, \"The tiger fang squad might've done this because of what I did to Zhang Ze Hu...... brother Zhang's arm..... I'm sorry!\"At this time, the fire hammer squad settled down and all of them were watching Luo Feng and Zhang Ke.\"Luo Feng\" Zhang Ke let out a smile, \"Don't always blame everything on yourself. This time, it's an indisputable fact that you saved our entire squad. As for me.....\" Zhang Ke lowered his head and looked at the wound in his right shoulder. His right arm had been long lost in the horde of monsters from before.\"My life as a free fighter is practically over\" sighed Zhang Ke.Gao Feng, Chen Gu, the Wei Jia brothers, and Luo Feng were all silent.\"However.\" Zhang Ke let out a smile, \"This is actually the best situation that I've predicted. I still remember when I was a kid during the Grand Nirvana period. During the Grand Nirvana Period, I witnessed for myself the large amounts of humans killed by monsters. At that time, I promised..... when I grow up, I'll kill these monsters with my own hand and become a hero!\"\"I've always been working hard\".\"And finally, I became a fighter, a free fighter! I entered the wilderness and fulfilled my childhood dream as I killed many monsters. I finally became a hero in the people's eyes. My wife praised me and finally married me. My daughter also always had a powerful fighter as a father to be proud of\".\"As time passed and as I killed more and more monsters..... I slowly started to get tired of it. Every time I entered the wilderness, my wife and kids were always worrying about the possibility of my death. I also worry that I won't be able to see them anymore. However, I didn't have the courage to pull out\" said Zhang Ke slowly, \"It's been like that for these past ten years or so, and I've gotten used to it\".At this time, Luo Feng's heart wasn't comfortable either.Family?He also had a brother and parents, who all worried about him.\"This wound finally gave me a reason to pull out\" smiled Zhang Ke slightly, \"I've gotten tired of this these past ten years or so. In the future, I can use my battle records to become an instructor of a region's Dojo of Limits. With more time on my hands, I can be with my wife and kids more! And on my back, I have you guys. To be able to have a spirit reader as a brother before quitting, haha, I guess it's worth it\".Luo Feng squeezed out a tiny smile.\"Brother, enjoy the relaxing, quiet life\" encouraged Gao Feng, \"In the future, find me for any problems you have! We've been together for seven, eight years, so we're brothers to the death!\".\"Hm\" smiled Zhang Ke as he nodded, \"I won't hold back at all. If I encounter any difficulties, I'll be sure to find you guys. Especially Luo Feng. I know that spirit readers will go through a period of insane growth, so your strength will soon skyrocket. In the future, you'll become amazing. You better not decline my requests for help!\"Asking me to help?It was partially thanks to brother Zhang that I was able to enter the fire hammer squad. And what happened to brother Zhang was probably because of me, so how can I not help?\"Brother Zhang, your problems are my problems!\" said Luo Feng.Zhang Ke nodded, and asked out of curiosity: \"Oh yea, Luo Feng. How come you hid the fact that you're a spirit reader?\"\"Mainly because I didn't want to deal with too much trouble\" laughed Luo Feng as he shook his head, \"If the fact that I'm a spirit reader gets out, I probably won't be able to live a quiet life\". He read that he should keep his spiritual force a secret on the boards in the 'Limit Home' after becoming a fighter.Because once he reveals it, he'll become a target for focused training in the Dojo of Limits. First, he'll be sent to the world headquarters of the Dojo of Limits, and then he'll undergo great training, and then there'll be all sorts of great conditions......But he'll be unable to continue his current quiet life. Even though he ventures into the wilderness now, at least he can stay with his parents sometimes.\"Hm\"Gao Feng nodded, \"Luo Feng's thinking isn't bad. Whether it's the army, individual dojos, or rich families, they'll all be going crazy over trying to obtain spirit readers. Once a new spirit reader appears, each of the powers will fight over him! The army will use all sorts of tricks, so dojos send their spirit readers outside of the country's borders until they come to an agreement with the army. Only after that will they let the spirit reader come back\".A spirit reader, is a trump card!Each spirit reader has a large impact, so all of the powers fight over them. Even though they get special rights, they'll lose the regular life of a fighter.'Captain, I hope everyone will help me keep this a secret\" said Luo Feng.\"Yea, of course. Our fighter squad will be glad to keep this secret for you\" laughed Gao Feng loudly.Chen Gu also nodded excitedly on the side: \"Yup, our fire hammer squad has a 'spirit reader', and other fighter squads don't know that, hmph hmph...... We won't appear as strong to them, so they won't be cautious. So if someone messes with us, they'll be in huge trouble. And it'll be way easier to hunt monsters in the future!\"A trump card, is only a trump card if you hide it!Once you reveal it, it won't have the same effect anymore.Wei Tie couldn't help but to say, \"Yea, and when the captain is fighting with a monster head on, Luo Feng can use his throwing knives for a sneak attack. One hit one kill\".Wei Qing followed up on the side: \"Yea, Luo Feng can use his blade to attack, causing the monsters to think he mainly attacks with his blade. After that, Luo Feng can secretly use his throwing knives and surprise them! Surely the monster wouldn't even have time to cry!\". A spirit reader in a squad can instantly raise the entire squad's strength by a factor of 10!The members of the fire hammer squad were all excitedly discussing about Luo Feng's potential in the squad.Clearly, a spirit reader greatly benefits the fire hammer squad.After a while, the members of the fire hammer squad all began to rest. The sky also slowly became dark and filled with stars.Under the starry sky, Luo Feng quietly sat on the edge of the rooftop, thinking about the battle they had: \"Today, I can't believe I managed to pull off the first stage of the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd on the armor piercing bullet\". When he thought of this, Luo Feng couldn't help but to stand up and take out his ghost blade.\"HU!\"With one step, the core of the body, 'the waist', practically has to instantly explode with force. But at the same time, the waist has to naturally send out another wave of force when the power from the muscles reaches the wrist. These two forces connect and reach the wrist together.\"PUCHI!\"The ghost blade drew a cold light across the vast sky.\"Indeed, I can exert another force. With these two forces combined, 70 + 70, which is 140% of the strength\" Luo Feng also felt it. His body can't release anymore force after the first stage.However, this was already pretty good.It's pretty hard to learn the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, but he was able to naturally enter the first stage on the border of life and death. It seems that there's still hope to keep climbing up in the future.Suddenly-\"AO WU~~\"An enraged sound of a howling wolf carried from somewhere below. The members of the fire hammer squad, that were resting under the starry sky, all woke up from shock.\"It's the howl of a wolf!\" said Gao Feng seriously.\"I can't believe there're wolf type monsters\" Chen Gu took a deep breath. Every single wolf type monster was powerful.Wolf type?Luo Feng was also shocked. There were very few wolf type monsters before the Grand Nirvana period, and their cruelty is unrivaled. After the Grand Nirvana period, who knows how much more savage and cruel the wolf type monsters have become. Their strength is also still unrivaled.Luo Feng took his binoculars and looked towards the sound of the wolf's howl at the edge of the rooftop.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWith the help of the built-in night vision function of the binoculars, he quickly found that there was a large wolf on a street two miles away from him. The wolf was around three meters high and five or six meters long. All the fur on its body was gray, but there were some white hairs hidden on its head.Even with the large distance separating them, Luo Feng could still feel the aura the cruel wolf was emitting.\"This is.....\" Luo Feng compared the wolf with the data of monsters in his head.\"It's the hunter, 'Silver Moon Wolf'\" exclaimed Chen Gu out of surprise, \"I can't believe it's the king of the wolves\ufffdD\ufffdDSilver Moon Wolf\"Luo Feng couldn't help but to be startled.Yes, this is a silver moon wolf!As king of the wolves, even the weakest adult silver moon wolf is at least a 'medium level commander'. The fur of commander level silver moon wolves are usually gray, but when they start fighting, all of the fur becomes a silver color! And the white hairs on their forehead occasionally change into the color of blood!It's known for its sinister tricks and murderous madness! And its fur has an astronomical price in society. The skullcap of the silver moon wolf, which has unrivaled hardness and numerous functions, is also extremely high-priced.\"This is a high level commander level silver moon wolf\". Luo Feng used the body size and color of the fur to make his judgment and couldn't help but to take in a breath, \"A high level commander! And it's a silver moon wolf!\". Not all high level commanders are the same. For example, is a spirit reader and a fighter the same just because they have the same rank?Silver moon wolves are born with extreme cruelty.\"Look, it's abdomen is injured, and pretty badly\" said Wei Tie quietly.Suddenly, all the people at the scene turned their heads towards captain Gao Feng.\"Captain, this is the king of wolves\ufffdD\ufffdDSilver moon wolf! A high level commander! This one silver moon wolf is worth more than ten high level commander level 'Lion Mastiff' monsters! We'll make tons of money off of this\". Chen Gu couldn't help but to say excitedly, \"Captain, hurry and make your decision\".Wei Tie also couldn't contain himself on the side: \"Captain, this silver moon wolf is moving forward at a very quick pace; it'll soon leave our field of vision. We can't delay anymore\".\"Even if the silver moon wolf is injured, it's not something we can deal with\" said Gao Feng quietly, \"Clear your minds up, don't let money control you\".A heavily injured high level commander is extremely rare.And needless to say, meeting a heavily injured king of wolves, 'silver moon wolf', is like winning the lottery! If a high level commander level 'silver moon wolf' wasn't injured, even an advanced warlord wouldn't be an opponent.\"Captain, I'll try\" said Luo Feng.\"Luo Feng.....\" Gao Feng hesitated, \"are you confident??\".\"I'm not too confident in killing the silver moon wolf, since I never killed one before..... But I'm a hundred percent sure I can escape\" laughed Luo Feng. People are most jealous of a spirit reader's capability to\ufffdD\ufffdDFly! Spiritual force can be used on inorganic material.Luo Feng can instantly use his spiritual force on his alloyed battle boots, letting him jump up to amazing heights.After that, he can put his shield under his feet and stand!With his spiritual force, he can control the shield, so naturally Luo Feng himself can fly.Flying..... this is the capability people are most jealous of. Even a powerful wargod level fighter can't help but to be jealous. This is also another reason why all the major powers are fighting over spirit readers.\"Okay, Luo Feng, be careful. If you can do it, then do it. If you can't, then don't force yourself. Safety is the most important\" said Gao Feng as he entrusted the task to Luo Feng.\"Relax\" laughed Luo Feng.With his ghost blade and shield in hand, Luo Feng directly jumped off the rooftop of the six story residential apartment. Hu! Luo Feng started descending rapidly. A regular advanced warrior would be able to withstand the impact from jumping off a six story building, but Luo Feng didn't have to do anything that foolish.The powerful, shapeless energy was used on the alloyed battle boots below his feet, and Luo Feng's speed decreased rapidly.He softly landed on the ground of the small sector below.Luo Feng directly sprinted at an amazing speed. As nimble as a monkey, Luo Feng arrived on the street with two jumps.The rest of the fire hammer squad watched closely with their binoculars on the rooftop.\"So this is Luo Feng's true strength\" Wei Tie couldn't help but to express himself, \"No wonder spirit readers are the most feared bunch out of fighters. This is just too scary. With their spiritual force, their speed, agility, etc. can all reach unbelievable levels. And there's also telekinesis, which is even more messed up!\"\"It's messed up\" Chen Gu couldn't help but to nod.\"Haha, so you should all be happy\" Gao Feng slightly smiled, \"A spirit reader joined our fire hammer squad just like that\".When they heard this, the others suddenly laughed.\"Captain, guys, do you think Luo Feng can kill that silver moon wolf?\" laughed Zhang Ke as he laid on the ground.\"Hard to say\" hesitated Gao Feng, \"A high level commander level monster. And Luo Feng just barely qualifies as an 'intermediate warlord' as a spirit reader. There's still hope if he was dealing with a weaker high level commander, but against the king of the wolves..... Thankfully this hunter 'silver moon wolf' is already injured. Luo Feng has a bit of hope\".\"There's still hope!\" the group held their binoculars as they watched Luo Feng run.Like a flash of black lightning, Luo Feng raced on the street.\"This silver moon wolf sure runs quickly\". Luo Feng took a shortcut, thinking that he could stop the silver moon wolf. Who would've thought that there was still a mile between them, \"Hm, it's turning left?\".Luo Feng suddenly turned left and ferociously jumped over a wall into an abandoned residential sector. He continued taking the shortcut as he chased the silver moon wolf.\"Howl~~\"Two relaxing, lying lion mastiff monsters saw the human Luo Feng, and stood up suddenly in response. They gave off a low howl. The ground rumbled as they started charging, but Luo Feng didn't alter his course at all as he sprinted. He was also too lazy to dodge.\"PUCHI!\" \"PUCHI!\"Two throwing knives automatically left Luo Feng's thigh and formed two flashes of light. With such a short distance, the two lion mastiffs had no time to dodge and had their heads pierced.The eyes of the two lion mastiffs were filled with shock as they quickly lost their life. \"RUMBLE~~\" They directly fell on the ground, which caused a short tremor. Without any blood stuck to them, the two throwing knives formed a line and flew back to Luo Feng's thigh.Luo Feng quietly jumped into a neighboring alley. With a glance, he saw the silver moon wolf that was at the end of an alley around a hundred meters away.\"WOO~~\" the cruel silver moon wolf stopped and stared at the human not too far away.\"A silver moon wolf, a heavily wounded silver moon wolf\". Luo Feng's eyes flashed, and a smile appeared on his face, \"Alright, with you, we'll see how strong I am right now!\" as he said that, Luo Feng approached the silver moon wolf one step at a time.The silver moon wolf silently stood in place.The eyes of the silver moon wolf that was almost three meters tall, flashed. At the same time, a weird energy flowed through the fur on its body, instantly turning into the color of silver! The silver moon wolf became dazzling! Even the white fur on its forehead became the color of blood!A silver colored body and a blood red crown.This is the silver moon wolf!Luo Feng moved forward one step at a time and became cautious. When he shortened the distance between himself and the silver moon wolf to 50 meters...\"WHOOSH!\" the silver moon wolf instantly became a white flash of light and was in front of him in a blink of an eye!\"Speed of sound!\"With Luo Feng's reaction speed that had been tested frequently at the dojo, he determined..... this silver moon wolf's speed nears the speed of sound!Luo Feng's face changed greatly and he instantly jumped up like lightning. The silver moon wolf, at practically the exact same time, also jumped up. This jump was just 20 to 30 meters high. Luo Feng could even see the blurred face of the silver moon wolf under the speed of sound, with its hidden cold, blood red eyes.The powerful spiritual force was ferociously used on the alloyed battle boots on his feet, causing Luo Feng to go even higher and dodging the attack from the silver moon wolf.\"So what if your speed reaches the speed of sound. Can you go faster than my throwing knives?\" as he dodged the silver moon wolf, Luo Feng pulled out the six throwing knives on his thigh. The six throwing knives instantly became six flowing lights and, like a net, charged towards the silver moon wolf.Having traveled the wilderness for all these years, the silver moon wolf was also extremely intelligent.With its speed, the human fighter in the air shouldn't have been able to dodge its attack. Only one type of person could change directions and speed at will in the air\ufffdD\ufffdDSpirit readers! When the silver moon wolf realized that the human fighter in front of him was a spirit reader, it couldn't help but to be shocked.But by that time, the six throwing knives, like lightning, already arrived!\"WOO~\" the silver moon wolf gave out a loud, piercing roar. It couldn't change direction or speed in the air; it could only fiercely twist its body and use its claws to hit the throwing knives away.With such a short distance, Luo Feng's reaction speed isn't fast enough for him to make the throwing knives avoid the claws.PENG! PENG!Two of the six throwing knives were actually hit, but Luo Feng, who was still in the air, let out a smile. Even though he let out six throwing knives...... as of now, he can only guarantee that two throwing knives can reach their full power. So the six throwing knives were just there to confuse the silver moon wolf.Only two of these throwing knives are truly dangerous.\"Hunter, you're the first commander level monster to die at my hands\" laughed Luo Feng. Suddenly, two of the four originally agile throwing knives lost their power, and the other two charged towards the silver moon wolf's abdomen like lightning! The silver moon wolf was helpless in midair, even though it howled as it tried to use its claws to block the attack.However -PUCHI! PUCHI!The two throwing knives pierced through the previous wound, directly piercing into the body of the silver moon wolf. The internal organs of the silver moon wolf were sliced up into pieces, and the enraged silver moon wolf gave its last howl as it fell down!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As it died, it thought about the memories of its life. As a silver moon wolf, the king of the wolves, it had been hoping to become a horde leader ever since it was little. It was always doing well, and it was only one step away from becoming a horde leader!However.....It was ambushed by a wargod level fighter squad and was heavily injured. Thankfully, it was able to rely on the speed it was so proud of to escape. However, as it was escaping, it encountered a warlord level fighter squad. If it wasn't injured, it would've been able to easily deciminate them!But, it was heavily injured.And this warlord fighter squad continued to haunt it, chasing after it every time. No matter where it ran, that squad was always chasing it.\"Those sickening human bastards!\"\"At least dying to the hands of a spirit reader is better than dying to those bastards\". The silver moon wolf was extremely intelligent. It was a high level commander level king of the wolves that could rival horde leader level monsters in intellect. And horde leader level monsters are usually as intelligent as humans.If it's going to die, it has to die to someone powerful.\"PENG!\"The large body of the silver moon wolf came crashing down, causing the surrounding walls to wobble and then fall. Luo Feng quickly descended after it.\"Huff, huff, I can't believe that I was able to kill a silver moon wolf\". Luo Feng stood beside the corpse of the silver moon wolf and let out a long sigh. After that, the four throwing knives that were dancing around Luo Feng returned to his thigh, \"Hm? There should be two more throwing knives\". Luo Feng scanned the area.With a glance, he saw two pits on the concrete floor ahead. The concrete floor split open from the shaking, and the two 6th series throwing knives were precisely in these two pits!After this scene, Luo Feng couldn't help but to take in a deep breath.The silver moon wolf's speed and power were both unbelievably great.\"Just in case another squad finds out, I'll dissect this body first. This one silver moon wolf could cost as much as a city\" Luo Feng thought no further and immediately started dissecting with his throwing knife in hand. His ghost blade is a 5th series one, which is able to fight with medium level commanders.His throwing knives were 6th series, and could fight against high level commanders!Luo Feng ferociously slashed towards the silver moon wolf's wounded, split abdomen with his throwing knife.\"Hm?\"Luo Feng stared. The fur had long been split open, and yet his full force wasn't even able to cut open half of it. Isn't this too amazing. It's extremely difficult dissecting a monster that isn't wounded, but once they have a large wound, it becomes much easier. Sadly..... Luo Feng's strength isn't enough to dissect a high level commander's corpse!\"Fuck, looks like even dissecting this monster is difficult\" laughed Luo Feng. He then immediately used his spiritual force on one of the throwing knives.The power of his spiritual force was way stronger than the strength of his arm.\"PUCHI!\" the floating knife sliced along the split fur. A \"CHI\" \"CHI\" sound rang as the wound slowly expanded.\"It's still so tiring even when I'm using my spiritual force to control my knife?\" Luo Feng was surprised. With a beat of his heart, the controlled throwing knife fiercely pierced towards a fine patch of fur. The back of the silver moon wolf was a bit bent, but the fur showed no signs of injury.Luo Feng was startled: \"That's just crazy\".\"This time I seriously had some bullshit luck\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to gasp, \"Its speed approached the speed of light and it was so powerful. Even the defense of its expensive fur is astonishingly high. If it was in perfect condition, I'll probably only have a 20 to 30 percent chance of victory!\". If Luo Feng fought with it at its peak condition, then his throwing knives can only attack the eyes, ears, nose, and weak parts of the fur.However, with the silver moon wolf's agility, Luo Feng's chance of victory was indeed very low; to have a 20 to 30 percent chance of victory is already pretty good.\"HUA-LA!\"\"HUA-LA!\"Luo Feng swiftly dissected. First, he skinned the mysterious and expensive fur off, and then cut off the silver moon wolf's tough claws. These claws are used as material in making high grade ke-luo alloys, so they are just as expensive. There's also the silver moon wolf's extremely tough skullcap, fangs, and its special two eyes.If it was worth something, Luo Feng dissected it and put it into his bag.Many of the special inventions that humans have made are based off of material from various monsters.\"Got them all\"Luo Feng took in a deep long breath. Only a pile of flesh was left of the silver moon wolf's large corpse. Luo Feng moved his throwing knives back to his thigh and sighed. He used up lots of spiritual force fighting this silver moon wolf, but he used ten times that in dissecting the corpse!\"No matter what, it's a big haul\"\"This time, I can get quite a bit of money too\" Luo Feng let out a smile. The fire hammer squad splits the money according to each members' contribution in battle. Even if you're strong, if you don't help with hunting a monster, the fighter squad naturally won't give you any money.And Luo Feng killed this silver moon wolf alone.So Luo Feng will indeed receive lots of money.\"If someone found me next to this silver moon wolf's corpse, I'll be in trouble\" laughed Luo Feng, \"Even an advanced warlord probably wouldn't be able to heavily injure the silver moon wolf. It was probably a wargod level fighter. And there was even a tracking signal on the fur, good thing I got rid of it\". Luo Feng didn't want to make an enemy out of a fighter who was able to heavily wound the silver moon wolf.So, run!Luo Feng swiftly left, and only a pile of flesh was left.Under the dark night, the tiger fang squad carefully moved forward in the monster's territory in the city.\"Fucks sake, that hunter keeps sprinting around in this country level city. Since it's a commander level monster, the other monsters are too afraid to anger it. However, we can only move forward slowly......\" cursed a burly, bald man who was walking next to Zhang Ze Hu, \"After we kill this hunter, I'll be sure to grill its meat and eat it. If I don't eat it, I won't be able to get rid of my anger\".Zhang Ze Hu grinned and laughed on the side: \"Don't worry, our tracking signal is on that hunter. It doesn't matter where it runs to\".\"Where's the hunter?\" asked the captain of the tiger fang squad in a small voice.\"Captain, the hunter is around 13 miles away from us, but it isn't moving anymore. Maybe it's resting there\" laughed 'Dong Zi', the heated weapons user, as he held his tracking machine.At this time, the members of the tiger fang squad cheered.\"It's not moving?\"\"Resting? Haha\".They were afraid that the hunter 'silver moon wolf' would flee. Zhang Ze Hu laughed: \"It appears that the silver moon wolf thinks it's hiding in a safe spot and is getting ready to recover. Too bad it doesn't know our power\".\"Go! We can't miss this chance, it's only 13 miles away from here, so we'll get there quickly\" the eyes of the captain of the tiger fang squad flashed as he said softly, \"Everyone speed up. Maybe we'll be able to kill the hunter this time\".The tiger fang squad started moving forward at a much greater speed.Even if monsters are all around the city, a fighter squad would be able to move 13 miles in about half an hour if they rush.Around forty minutes later.\"Ahead is the resting spot of the silver moon wolf, everybody be careful\" the captain of the tiger fang squad slightly waved his hand and the six members of the tiger fang squad immediately split into two groups and moved around the target from different directions. They slowly surrounded the spot where the tracking machine displayed. Nobody dared to speak a word.A silver moon wolf is very sensitive.One step, two steps, three steps......Everybody was moving extremely carefully.\"GO!\" the tiger fang captain waved his hand and the other squad that received the signal moved at the same time.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!The two squads rushed into the alley from the two directions, one in front and one behind. They were around 100 meters away from the spot. The six members looked towards the spot, where the silver moon wolf should be. However, they didn't see their target, only..... the slight scent of blood in the air.\"Hm?\" the tiger fang captain's face changed.\"Not good!\"Virtually all the members of the tiger fang squad rushed over, over to the pile of flesh. Next to the pile of flesh were a few silver hairs!\"Damn it\" cursed Zhang Ze Hu as he grabbed his hair, 'someone stole it!\"Luo Feng knew that fighter squads leave tracking signals on heavily injured monsters. Since the silver moon wolf was heavily injured, there was an extremely high chance of a tracking signal being on it. So he quickly scanned it with his spiritual force and found something on its fur, and directly cut it off.\"Bastard!\" the tiger fang captain clenched his teeth with a grim face.\"All this time for nothing!\" the face of the one eyed middle aged man sank.\"Go\" a cold light flashed in the eyes of the tiger fang captain as he commanded, \"Dare to steal food from a tiger. They're asking for death by stealing our things! That fighter squad just dissected the body and would probably rush back to the resupplying base just to be safe! So..... brothers of the tiger fang squad, let's rush back towards the resupplying base as fast as possible! We'll steal it back from them when we catch up to them\".\"Yes, captain\" the five members immediately obeyed.\"Depart\" the tiger fang captain murderously waved his hand, and the other members of the tiger fang squad, who were just as mad, immediately followed their captain towards the resupplying base.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sometimes it'll run along the street, and sometimes it has to jump through a residential sector..... in mere moments, it reached the six story residential apartment where the members of the fire hammer squad resided.\"Luo Feng's here\".\"Yup, seems like he isn't injured\".The members of the fire hammer squad watched Luo Feng enter the residential apartment's staircase through their binoculars. Luo Feng arrived on the rooftop moments later.\"Captain, brother Chen\" Luo Feng laughed as he yelled.\"No injuries, hm, not bad. So, how'd it go? Were you able to kill the silver moon wolf?\" No matter how calm captain Gao Feng was, he just wasn't able to hold back from asking this question. Chen Gu, the Wei Jia brothers, and even Zhang Ke, who was still lying on the floor, looked at Luo Feng expectantly. Chen Gu even joyfully said: \"It looks like Luo Feng's backpack has gotten bigger\".Luo Feng laughed: \"Brother Chen, your eyes sure are poisonous. Yea, I just killed the silver moon wolf! I dissected it and put the stuff in my bag\".\"You really killed it?\" the eyes of the members of the fire hammer squad widened in surprise.A silver moon wolf!The king of the wolves! Regular wolf type monsters were already rare in the first place.\"I got lucky this time too\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to say, \"I'm afraid that the speed of this silver moon wolf reached the speed of sound! Its attack power was also absurd, and its fur was horrifyingly tough. If it wasn't for the fact that it was heavily injured in the first place and had a large wound on its abdomen, it would've been very difficult for me to kill it!\".\"Its speed approached the speed of sound?\" glared Chen Gu.\"That's absurd. Just what you'd expect from the king of the wolves, it can equal a low level pig type horde leader\" said Wei Tie out of surprise.\"Not good\" Gao Feng's face changed dramatically.Luo Feng was shocked by the captain.\"Captain, what's wrong? What happened?\" followed Luo Feng.\"The silver moon wolf was already heavily injured, so I'm sure that it fought with some human fighter squad in the past\" said Gao Feng hurriedly, \"The fighter squad that fought with it might've left a tracking signal on its fur. If this fighter squad chases after us and finds us, we'll be in trouble!\"Chen Gu heard and also became shocked: \"Yea, we can't mess with a fighter squad that can heavily injure a silver moon wolf. There might be a wargod level fighter!\".When Luo Feng heard this, he couldn't help but to be relieved.\"Captain, don't worry. I may not have much experience, but I naturally researched a lot about some common knowledge I should know before entering the wilderness for the first time. After killing the silver moon wolf, I checked it out, and there was indeed a tracking signal on it. I cut off the section of fur it was on\" said Luo Feng.Only after hearing that did Gao Feng and Chen Gu relax.They were worried about Luo Feng's lack of experience as a rookie. Since they stole someone else's heavily injured monster, if they manage to chase up, there'll be a problem.\"Zhang Ke is heavily injured, so our squad can't stay too long in the wilderness. Everybody rest up here. When it's bright tomorrow, we'll depart to the resupplying base\" said Gao Feng.\"Yes, captain\".The group cheerfully responded.Dawn of the second day, the fire hammer squad quietly left the #0201 country level city and headed towards the resupplying base along the old highway.In the military sector's resupplying base.\"Brother Hei\"Zhang Ze Hu was smoking and chatting with some brute with a large moustache in a corner of the resupplying base, \"Have you seen any members of the fire hammer squad return recently? Fuck, that little shrimp Luo Feng made me waste a hundred million. I'll never be satisfied if I don't mess with him\".\"Not yet. According to the registry, there's no news of the fire hammer squad's return\" laughed the large moustached brute, \"Tiger, if that Luo Feng messed with you, you have to teach him a lesson in the wilderness. You're banned from taking action in the resupplying base\".\"Of course I know that, I don't want to die yet\" laughed Zhang Ze Hu.The government's army manages the headquarter cities and military sectors behind the scenes. No matter how much fighters hate each other, they wouldn't dare to fight in the military sectors. If they do, then there'll be tragic consequences. In fact, the resupplying bases are small areas drawn out by the military, so they manage safety and everything else there.\"Brother Hei, give me a call when that Luo Feng comes back\" laughed Zhang Ze Hu.\"Sure, no problem\" laughed the large moustached brute.Zhang Ze Hu threw his cigarette butt on the floor, stepped on it, and then laughed: \"Alright brother, I'm off. Talk to you later\". Zhang Ze Hu then continued walking forward in the resupplying base. It's called a base, but it actually has an atmosphere like a residential sector's. Zhang Ze Hu quickly met the other two members of the squad under a large tree near the gates of the resupplying base.\"How is it, tiger?\" asked the one eyed middle aged man in a small voice.\"Hasn't returned yet, there's absolutely no news at all\" smiled Zhang Ze Hu.The bald middle aged man laughed slightly on the side: \"If not even one of them has returned yet, then I'm sure that they all died in the horde of monsters. It's good if they all died off, there won't be any trouble\". The tiger fang squad wasn't afraid of the fire hammer squad at all, but if any members of the fire hammer squad survive, there'll be a bit of trouble.\"Fire hammer squad, hmph, if you want to blame someone, blame that Luo Feng\" Zhang Ze Hu laughed coldly, \"Dared to make me spend money. Oh yea, have you guys found out who stole our hunter?\"\"No\" the one eyed middle aged man frowned as he shook his head, \"No news at all. The captain is drinking up out of anger in the room right now\".\"I think that, since we haven't been able to meet them on the way back, there's probably no chance of finding out who stole our hunter\" said the bald man as he shook his head. Suddenly, his face changed dramatically as he stared at the far away gate of the resupplying base. The other two noticed this and turned their heads in response, and their faces also changed completely!Gao Feng, Chen Gu, Wei Qing, Wei Tie, Luo Feng, and Zhang Ke were all at the gate of the resupplying base.\"A9, old Gao, seems like you've encountered some trouble this time\" the guardsman noticed Zhang Ke's missing arm and wrapped it up.\"Fuck, don't bring that up. The monsters didn't harm us, but those fucking tiger squad members did!\" cursed Gao Feng.\"Captain, the tiger fang squad is there\" Chen Gu suddenly roared ferociously.At this time, the members of the fire hammer squad all turned their heads and saw three people under the cold shade of a tree not too far away. After seeing these three people, all the faces of the members of the fire hammer squad became enraged. Zhang Ke, who was carrying a backpack and was still pale, even shouted: \"Don't move!\".Zhang Ze Hu and the other two saw the six members of the fire hammer squad and were shocked, so they started walking away.In this case, they were the offenders!But they didn't think that Chen Gu would see them.\"Still trying to run?\" yelled Gao Feng.The six members of the fire hammer squad rushed over, and the yelling caused quite a bit of attention from the other fighters in the resupplying base. At this time, Zhang Ze Hu and the other two stopped running. If they actually slipped away, wouldn't that be admitting their wrongdoings? Even though they did it, they can't admit it!\"Gao Feng, what are you yelling for?\" yelled the one eyed middle aged man as he turned around, \"Where do you think this is? This is a military sector, a resupplying base for fighters. Is this the kind of place for you to act wildly?\"\"If you want to act wildly, look at the spot first\" laughed the bald man coldly.No matter what, you can't back down.\"Still acting arrogant?\" both of Gao Feng's hands reached for a hammer. He swung his hammers as he ferociously charged at them with red eyes, \"You're asking for a beating!\".The faces of the one eyed middle aged man, Zhang Ze Hu, and the bald man changed completely.They didn't say anything, since they were in the wrong.\"BEEP!\" \"BEEP!\" \"BEEP!\" an ear piercing whistle rang, and twelve uniform wearing men split up and charged over from afar. The captain of the squad yelled: \"Put your weapon down, no fighting in the resupplying base, or else our guards have the right to kill you!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The fire hammer squad and the tiger fang squad were quite well known in Jiang-Nan city. Under the commands of the guards of the resupplying base, the fire hammer squad forced themselves to calm down, since no one is allowed to challenge the military's authority.\"Stop!\" an aggressive yell. Luo Feng turned his head and saw a skinny man bringing the other two members of the tiger fang squad.Chen Gu said quietly beside Luo Feng: \"Luo Feng, this is the captain of the tiger fang squad, 'Pan Ya'. His nickname is 'Tiger Fang' and he uses a saber as his weapon. He isn't someone you would want to mess with\". Luo Feng couldn't help but to be shocked: this short, skinny, and seemingly insignificant man was actually the captain of the tiger fang squad!\"Tiger Fang?\" Luo Feng carefully looked at the man, 'Tiger Fang'. His gaze then moved towards Zhang Ze Hu, who was behind his captain. When Luo Feng's gaze was on Zhang Ze Hu, Zhang Ze Hu grinned. He then laughed to himself coldly, \"Keep being arrogant, Zhang Ze Hu! I will make not just you, but also your entire tiger fang squad suffer! Mark my words!\"Before Luo Feng entered the wilderness, he thought that the act of Zhang Hao Bai attempting to break his arms and legs was cruel.Now that he looks at his current situation.....The tiger fang squad only had a bit of hatred towards him, and yet they tried to eliminate his entire squad and pretend that nothing happened. What Zhang Hao Bai did was nothing compared to the tiger fang squad's actions.\"Captain\"\"Captain\"Zhang Ze Hu and the other two stood behind their captain. A large crowd was spectating the stand off between the tiger fang squad and the fire hammer squad. At that time, the captain of the patrolling squad coldly said: \"Gao Feng, Pan Ya, I don't care about what you have to discuss. However, if either of you take action, don't blame me. Brothers, let's go\"The captain waved his hand, since he was too lazy to watch. With his warning, he was pretty sure that these guys wouldn't dare to mess around.\"Tiger Fang\"!Gao Feng laughed coldly, \"You're sure cruel. I, Gao Feng, sure underestimated you. I didn't think you would do something so cruel and sinister! First, you secretly attacked us with a sniper rifle from far away, and then you attracted a horde of monsters to surround our squad, giving us almost no chance of survival. Unless someone powerful came and saved us, our squad would've been decimated!\".The fighters that were watching suddenly went into an uproar.The tiger fang squad was too cruel.\"Gao Feng, don't speak nonsense\" the tiger fang captain laughed coldly, \"My tiger fang squad did no such thing, so don't blame it on our squad!\". No matter what, they can't admit that they did such a thing. Once they admit it, his tiger fang squad will be in big trouble.\"My brother's arm was hit off by one your sniper rifle's bullets\" said Gao Feng with a gloomy face.\"If I said we didn't, then we didn't\" said the tiger fang captain coldly, \"If you have proof, bring it to the security agency and let them decide! Don't spout your nonsense here. Brothers, lets go\". The captain of the tiger fang squad was straightforward and wasn't willing to talk much to the fire hammer squad.Gao Feng, Chen Gu, and the others all had ugly faces on and Luo Feng was clenching his teeth in anger.However, Luo Feng was clear. His group had no kind of evidence at all. Even though there are many cases of fighters killing each other over valuable treasures in the wilderness, most of them can't bring out any type of evidence either. Since there's no evidence, the Dojo of Limits wouldn't be able to help out.\"Hmph, let's go!\" commanded Gao Feng as he coldly watched the tiger fang squad leave.The members of the fire hammer squad could only hold in their anger as they left.Resupplying base, #A9 villa will become the temporary resting spot of the fire hammer squad.\"Captain, no need to be angry now\" said Luo Feng, \"We can let those tiger fang squad members have their moment of pride. It wouldn't be too late to deal with them after they enter the wilderness.....\" Luo Feng's words caused the angry members of the fire hammer squad to let out smiles.Chen Gu patted Luo Feng's shoulder: \"Yea, our squad has you, Luo Feng. Destroying them won't be difficult\"\"Even ten years wouldn't be too late for a gentleman to have his revenge\" laughed Gao Feng as he grinned, \"And we don't even need to wait too long anyway. With Luo Feng, the tiger fang squad is doomed!\". At this time, the members of the fire hammer squad were all smiling, and even Zhang Ke gave out a rare sigh of relief. Spirit readers all have their periods of rapid growth.Luo Feng's ability is already terrifying, and it'll keep flying up!You can say...... that the tiger fang squad has virtually no hope at all!\"The tiger fang squad aside, let's deal with the spoils we got from hunting the monsters\" said Gao Feng, \"Even though we didn't go out for too long this time, we hunted four commander level monsters: A bloodthirsty tank, a two tailed ocelot, a lion mastiff, and a hunter!\"On their journey back to the resupplying base, Luo Feng and the others encountered a low level commander level lion mastiff monster. With Luo Feng and Gao Feng there, they easily killed it.\"However, the resupplying base isn't that big, so it'll be conspicuous if we bring out and try to sell the hunter's materials. At that time, we'll attract the attention of the fighter squad that heavily injured the silver moon wolf\" said Gao Feng seriously.\"Yea\"Chen Gu nodded in agreement, \"Wait until we get back to the city to sell the hunter's materials. We'll sell the other monsters' materials here\". For a fighter squad, it's not the soldier level monsters that are worth money, but the commander level monsters..... Needless to say, each of the horrifying horde leader level monsters are worth a ton!As for the high level commander level silver moon wolf, it's not only rare monsters, but also the king of the wolves. Its price will surely be equal to a normal low level horde leader, so it'll also be worth a ton!\"Everybody eat and rest, we'll sell them later\" smiled Gao Feng.After eating, the six members of the fire hammer squad found the representative of the HR alliance, and directly sold to him the materials of the monsters. Other than the silver moon wolf's materials, they sold everything.In the A9 villa, the fire hammer squad was huddle around a computer and dividing up the money.\"Luo Feng collected many materials from soldier level monsters, whether they're G level or F level. On average, each of the soldier level monsters' materials are worth 6 thousand. In other words, Luo Feng gets around 120 thousand from the soldier level monsters\" the captain was dividing up the money, \"Wei Tie collected materials from 12 soldier level monsters, and they're all F level. On average, they're worth around 8 thousand each, so it's roughly 100 thousand total\".\"The amount of materials that Wei Qing collected from soldier level monsters.....\"\"Zhang Ke collected materials from 11 different soldier level monsters.....\"\"Alright, next, we'll be dividing the spoils from the commander level monsters. All the materials from the twin tailed ocelot was worth around 12 million\" Gao Feng looked at the group, \"I did most of the work in hunting it. If there weren't any accidents, I would get 60% of it, but..... after killing it, we were attacked by a horde of monsters and Luo Feng saved all of us! Luo Feng helped a lot. And Zhang Ke received a heavy wound, so since he's handicapped, he'll get 60% of the money from this commander level monster. I'll get 10%, Luo Feng will get 15%, and Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and Chen Gu each get 5%!\".\"Nobody has any complaints right?\" said Gao Feng.\"No complaints\" Luo Feng nodded.A rule in the fighter squads, if someone becomes handicapped because of a battle, he gets 60% of the spoils. This also counts as some kind of 'subsidy'.\"So, out of this 12 million, 7.2 million goes to Zhang Ke, 1.8 million to Luo Feng. I get 1.2 million, Chen Gu and the others get 600 thousand each\" Gao Feng inputted the numbers, \"The lion mastiff monster we killed on the way back was worth 10 million. Everybody contributed quite a bit in this battle, so me and Luo Feng each get 30%. Chen Gu, Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and Zhang Ke each get 10%. No complaints right?\"Everybody nodded.Actually, Zhang Ke didn't do anything in that battle, but everybody wanted to give him some money. Zhang Ke himself didn't say anything..... a fighter squad is quite compassionate.\"Luo Feng and I get 3 million each, and the others get 1 million each\"Gao Feng slightly smiled, \"The bloodthirsty tank was worth the most money, it reached 16 million. Chen Gu did the most work, he killed it in one hit, so he gets 60%! Everybody else contributed too, so Luo Feng, Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and Zhang Ke each get 10%. No need to include me\". Naturally, Gao Feng was the richest person in the fighter squad.Usually, Gao Feng did most of the work when hunting a commander level monster. So all these years, the amount of money Gao Feng makes could be up to ten times higher than everyone else's.That's why Gao Feng is quite modest if he didn't do much in a fight.\"In other words, Chen Gu gets 9.6 million. Zhang Ke, Luo Feng, Wei Qing, and Wei Tie each get 1.6 million.\"In total\"\"Chen Gu gets 11.26 million, Luo Feng gets 6.52 million, I get 4.2 million, Zhang Ke gets 9.91 million, Wei Tie gets 3.3 million, and Wei Qing gets 3.32 million\" Gao Feng reported the final totals and laughed, \"Of course, we still have our treasure, the materials of the silver moon wolf, which will surely earn us a ton!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He did it all himself\" laughed Gao Feng, \"So Luo Feng can claim the maximum amount, '80%'. As for the rest, the 20%, we'll split it evenly between the five of us\". This was a rule in the fighter squads.Even if one person does all the work, he has to give everyone else a little bit too.Usually, when killing commander level monsters, the person who does most of the work can get at most 60%. In this case, where Luo Feng did all of the work, he can get at most 80%.\"Luo Feng, your earnings this time probably exceeds the amount of which I've earned over the past ten years\" Chen Gu couldn't help but to yell on the side, \"You better treat all of us tonight!\"\"Yes, you better. Pulverize this rich man\" followed Wei Tie and Wei Qing.Even Zhang Ze Hu of the 'tiger fang squad' only earned 100 million from two years of hard work. And Zhang Ze Hu is in his peak in those two years. Before..... he made even less money. In other words, Zhang Ze Hu probably only made 300 to 400 million from all these years of work.As for Luo Feng..... just this one time made him rich!However, not just anybody can kill the 'hunter'. Naturally, with Luo Feng's power, he can make lots of money. Strength is everything in the circle of fighters, and those with money are usually amazing.\"Of course, how could I not? I'll treat everyone in the HR alliance market\" laughed Luo Feng.\"I'll split the money first and send it to each of your accounts\"said Gao Feng as he laughed. In front of everyone, he transferred the money he received from before into each account of the members of the fire hammer squad one by one. Everyone in the squad knows each other's username and password for their public accounts. Usually, they divide the money right when they get it.In the afternoon of the same day, Luo Feng and the others rode a train back home.\"The train is about to enter the station. Customers that are getting off, please prepare your belongings\" a recorded sound rang throughout the train carriage, and with a 'hua' sound, the train carriage's door opened.\"Go!\"Gao Feng, Luo Feng, Zhang Ke, Chen Gu, and the Wei Jia brothers all walked out.\"So many people\" Luo Feng stepped out the train and saw a huge amount of tourists in the train station. Tons of densely packed people could be seen waiting for the train through the glass of the train station. A main city in a headquarter city has a population of over 100 million, so one can imagine how lively it would be in a train station there!This is called popularity, steaming popularity!\"Brothers, thank the weapons in our hands, for we have once again returned to the city alive!\" said Gao Feng thankfully.\"We're back\"\"Back to a human city\"Luo Feng was also shocked inside. Even though he was in the wilderness for only seven, eight days, it was desolate, ruined, and empty. The cities in the wilderness can't even be recognized as cities. There were huge amounts of monsters, so Luo Feng and the others always had to tread carefully in fear of being surrounded by them.Only headquarter cities! These are the only safe places for humans to live in! These are the places where civilization exists!\"Headquarter cities, the final base for humanity\" a thought rose from Luo Feng's heart, \"It's for humanity's cities that powerful fighters stand up! As for me, I can easily kill regular soldier level monsters and even low level commander level monsters. However, even with weapons, a regular person would be in an extremely bad situation against a commander level monster\".Why do countries give fighters special rights?Why does the entire world encourage fighters to hunt monsters?Because the more monsters that are hunted, the safer the human cities become.\"Hello, I'll probably be able to return home late into the night today\" Zhang Ke held his phone with a smile on his face, \"Yea, I'll be staying home for an extremely long time, so I'll be sure to please my great wife!\". Who could've thought that someone who lost his arm could have such an honest, natural smile on his face at this time.Deep down inside, the fighters that fight on the border of life and death in the wilderness are always worried about their families.Luo Feng also called his home's phone.\"Feng\"Luo Feng's eyes became uncomfortable as he heard this familiar sound, and he responded, \"Mom, I'll probably get back home late in the night, so you guys don't have to wait for me to eat dinner\".\"Tonight?\" his mom was clearly joyful, \"Alright, alright, your dad is outside with your brother, I'll tell them to pick up the phone\".\"No need, I'll be back tonight\" Luo Feng's heart felt warm.This is home, the place Luo Feng defends.\"Luo Feng, go, ride the HR alliance's special fighter-only car\" commanded Gao Feng. The others have already started to leave.\"Coming\"Luo Feng hung up and immediately joined the others. They rode on a fighter-exclusive path. At the end of the path was a small area, where there were special cars from the Dojo of Limits, Thunder Dojo, HR alliance, and even some underground alliances waiting for their fighters.As they saw Luo Feng and the others come out, all the chauffeurs cheered up.\"Go, go to the alliance market\" Gao Feng and the others directly went into the alliance market's car.\"Alright\"The large, comfortable SUV was started, locked, and with a step on the gas pedal, moved forward.Inside the car.\"Luo Feng, we'll be at the alliance market soon\" laughed Chen Gu as he looked at Luo Feng, \"Maybe that Xu Xin chick from last time is still there. Luo Feng, now that you're back from the wilderness, you better get your feelings across and get that relationship started\".\"You pervert\" scolded Gao Feng as he laughed, and then looked towards Luo Feng, \"Luo Feng, a word of advice. That little girl Xu Xin managed to become a bar manager in that lobby at such a young age, so she's not just anyone. She probably has some sort of background, so watch for that\".Luo Feng nodded.He also had the same feeling. In school, Xu Xin was extremely normal. However, at the bar in the alliance market's lobby, the air around Xu Xin was completely different. If we say she was completely shy in the past, then now she's shining like a bright light.\"Are you guys talking about lady Xu Xin?\" asked the driver in a surprised tone.\"You know Xu Xin?\" Luo Feng looked towards him,\"Of course I do\" laughed the driver, \"We're always going to the alliance market, so all us brothers that go there to chat obviously know about lady Xu Xin. Even though she isn't extremely pretty..... hehe, whoever can marry her would have an extremely relaxing life\"Gao Feng's face slightly changed, \"Don't tell me that she's from one of the great 12 families of the alliance in the country, the Xu family\".\"Yes, precisely the Xu family. I heard that the Xu family's status in the country is pretty high\" said the driver as he nodded.Luo Feng was also surprised as he heard this.The alliance is made out of super rich families and corporations from America, Europe, etc. You can say that all the large and powerful families from the whole world formed an alliance together. They control the world's economy together and all the governments' armies have no choice but to peacefully coexist with them.And--in the alliance, besides the nine large families at the top, there are still dozens of other families that are rank 1 in the alliance, corporations aside.Each of these families hold an astonishing amount of wealth and an astonishing amount of power.\"Fuck, that's too much of a background\" glared Chen Gu, \"I knew this girl's name was Xu, but I didn't think she'd be from the Xu family. Luo Feng brother, even big bro can't help you get this girl Xu Xin, it's too hard\"\"It is hard, but our Luo Feng ain't bad at all\" said Gao Feng.Chen Gu, Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and Zhang Ke all started laughing.From their point of view, Luo Feng is a spirit reader whose strength will only become more horrifying.\"Old Fang\"Gao Feng spoke through his phone\" Yea, it's me. Of course we have something good for you, or else why would I call you? It's worth over 100 million for sure. Alright, no problem\" after calling, Gao Feng looked at the others in the eye, \"I told old Fang. When we get to the alliance market, we'll directly go upstairs\".\"Okay\" Luo Feng and the others nodded.Moments later -The special car passed the soldiers' security line and directly drove to the gate of the alliance market's lobby. The members of the fire hammer squad all got off the car as its doors opened.\"Mr. Gao Feng, manager Fang is already waiting upstairs\" smiled a seemingly capable, pretty woman with short hair and ears.\"Okay\"Gao Feng, Luo Feng, and the others didn't say much more and directly went into the lobby.In the extravagant lobby, there were quite a bit of fighters chatting in the direction of the bar. Luo Feng's gaze scanned the bar: \"Not here?\". Then he realized that college begins around this date, and even regular colleges undergo military training when they first begin.And today isn't a weekend, so it's not weird that Xu Xin isn't here.\"DING!\"The elevator door opened and the members of the fire hammer squad went in.\"BEEP!\" The woman stood in front of the elevator door and pressed '21'. She then aligned her eyes with a detector, \"BEEP, pass, welcome lady Liu\".\"Manager Fang is waiting on the 21st floor\" smiled the woman.Luo Feng and the others nodded.The elevator quickly went up and didn't stop until they got there. In just a bit, \"DING\", the elevator door opened. They arrived on the 21st floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 57Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter walking out of the elevator, there was an extremely large resting lounge. Just that one resting lounge was probably around 300 to 400 square meters. In the resting lounge were a few bar sofas, where several people were waiting to meet manager Feng. However, they saw..... a squad of fighters that didn't need to wait at all. They just directly walked towards manager Fang's office.\"Manager Fang is inside, please go ahead\" lady Liu directly brought Luo Feng and the others into manager Fang's office.In the office, Luo Feng looked around. The ornaments around were sparkling and the floor was made out of toughened glass. Below the toughened glass was a river with fish swimming in it. One can see quite a bit of fish below while standing on top of the toughened glass.\"How luxurious\" Luo Feng thought to himself.\"Gao Feng, looks like you guys really made a bit this time\" a bald, old man with a round face left his seat and laughed as he walked over, \"Here, come over and sit\".The group sat on the sofas facing each other on the side of the office.\"So, what do you have this time?\" the round faced old man laughed as he said, \"Let's see it\".\"Old Fang, I'll open your eyes this time\" laughed Gao Feng, \"A big manager like you receives quite a bit of fighter squads, but you'll rarely see something like this. Luo Feng, take it out\".\"Oh?\" manager Fang was shocked and his eyes lit up.Luo Feng laughed as he saw manager Fang's reaction as he took out the precious fur of the silver moon wolf from the backpack beside his feet. He put the fur on the ground and spread it out. As if it was a flat silver moon wolf, you could feel the killing intent of the silver moon wolf from it.\"Hunter!\" manager Fang was so shocked that he couldn't help but to stand up.\"There there\" manager Fang was so shocked that he couldn't help but to speak in his hometown's dialect, \"Old Gao, this sure is something. For a hunter to be this large, it's probably a high level commander. WIth the silver moon wolf's speed, even a powerful man who just stepped into the wargod level would have trouble killing it\".The silver moon wolf's speed was indeed shocking. When it was heavily injured, it could reach the speed of sound! One could imagine how fast it would be if it wasn't injured!\"Hm hm, the fur is quite complete\" inspected manager Fang, \"Looks like the fur was cut along the wound. However..... it is indeed quite complete\". Manager Fang's eyes flashed. The fur of a silver moon wolf is indeed one of the finest materials for clothes in the entire world.Even though this fur had other uses, important figures of the world were willing to buy clothes made out of this fur for high prices.\"Give me a second\" manager Fang directly ran over to his office desk.And he swiftly took out a locked safe and, while holding it, ran back.\"Gao Feng, you guys don't have to prolong this anymore. Just take out all the other materials of the hunter\" laughed manager Fang as he persuaded. At the same time, he opened the locked safe, which contained a delicate apparatus. After activating it, a red light shone from the top of the apparatus.Luo Feng took out the other things one by one.The special eyes, claws, fangs, the bones of the legs.....\"Quite a complete collection\"Manager Fang's eyes were filled with light as the apparatus shone its red light on the fur, and soon after, the eyes, claws, fangs..... The apparatus displayed a number on its small screen. Manager Fang's expression was serious as he stared at the number, and at the same time, typed the information through a virtual keyboard. Moments later--\"Hm\"\"These materials are indeed from the same hunter. And this hunter, is indeed a high level commander!\" right when manager Fang finished saying that, Gao Feng laughed on the side as he said, \"It should be a high level commander that's nearing the horde leader level!\".Even in the category of high level commander level monsters, there are large differences.Monsters that just stepped into the high level commander level and high level commander level monsters that are nearing the horde leader level could have huge differences in strength. Naturally, the prices of their materials differ greatly too.\"Hehe, of course, I can't hide that point from you guys\" laughed manager Fang, \"Alright, name your price\".The members of the fire hammer squad looked at each other, and Gao Feng's look signalled Luo Feng.Luo Feng laughed as he spoke, \"Manager Fang, what do you think is an appropriate price?\". In the 'Home of Limits' and the HR alliance's internet market, there were many prices for a hunter. Luo Feng clearly knew that a high level commander level monster would sell for a lower price to the Dojo of Limits because the Dojo of Limits would give quite a bit of contribution points in return.As for the HR alliance market, high level commander level monsters are normally in the 50 million to 500 million dollars range.Of course, a hunter is naturally strong, rare, and is the king of the wolves, so its price also has to go above the normal price limit.\"How about this, these materials are indeed good. 600 million Chinese dollars!\" said manager Fang after taking a deep breath.Even for him, he rarely makes such huge business.Materials from low level horde leader level monsters also usually go for this price.Gao Feng, Luo Feng, and the others already discussed the price before coming here. Luo Feng read in the fighter discussion boards that someone sold a 'medium level commander level' hunter for around 50 million earth dollars in South America.50 million earth dollars is equivalent to 175 million Chinese dollars.If a medium level commander level hunter can sell for this much, then this high level commander level should be worth much more, especially since its already nearing the horde leader level.\"Old Fang, your price is too low\" said Gao Feng as he frowned, \"A medium level commander level hunter could already sell for 175 million Chinese dollars in South America. 900 million to 1 billion dollars shouldn't be a problem for ours\".\"Gao Feng, don't play around with me. It could never reach the price of 900 million to 1 billion\" laughed manager Fang bitterly.Luo Feng laughed as he saw this.Actually, the squad came to the conclusion that this hunter should be able to sell for around 700 to 800 million while they were discussing. Captain Gao Feng was just scaring manager Fang by saying this.\"Hunting this silver moon wolf costed the arm of my brother\" said Gao Feng with an ugly face, \"I won't say anymore..... 800 million Chinese dollars! If you accept, then we have a deal. Otherwise, I can find someone else. Because of our relationship, I directly came to old Fang without finding anyone else first\".Manager Fang glanced at Zhang Ke, indeed.....Zhang Ke lost an arm.\"Looks like manager Fang can't pay this price. Let's go\" Gao Feng stood up, and Luo Feng immediately started packing up the materials of the silver moon wolf.\"750 million, my limit\" said manager Fang as he frowned.However, Gao Feng didn't make a sound, and Luo Feng directly finished packing up.\"Go\" Gao Feng started heading out.\"Gao Feng, 750 million is pretty good already\" sighed manager Fang. As he saw Gao Feng and the others heading out, he yelled, \"Come back, we'll do your price!\"Luo Feng, Gao Feng, Chen Gu, and the others at the door looked at each other and let out a smile.There were a few dozen managers purchasing monsters' materials in the HR alliance market. The HR alliance market goes by an elimination system. In other words, those who perform the worst every year directly have their position of manager taken away from them. Naturally, a new person comes to replace them. Under such pressure......Naturally, every manager tries to figure out how to collect monsters' materials from fighters.In the office.\"You fighters are too cruel now\" said manager Fang as he was working on the transaction, but he also thanked, \"Each manager and even each agent from every sector are all competing against each other to purchase materials from the fighters. As the prices become clearer and clearer, our profits become lower and lower. Seeing how you guys just made 800 million in one breath, it even makes old me want to go hunt monsters in the wilderness. Sadly, an old bag of bones like me probably can't even beat a soldier level monster\".As he said that, manager Fang was conducting the transactions to each account.\"Manager Fang, your personal assets probably surpass mine with all your meddling these years\" laughed Gao Feng.\"Luck. Sometimes I'll encounter something big, and I'll be able to make a bunch of money\" manager Fang let out a smile.Gao Feng laughed: \"With this, you're probably going to make at least eight digits worth of profit\"\"Not that much\" manager Fang shook his head, \"Okay, done. I transferred 800 million Chinese dollars into your fighter squad's account\".Gao Feng, and vice captain Chen Gu received notices from their tactical communications watch notifying them the increase of 800 million Chinese dollars in their accounts.\"Old Fang, feels great\" laughed Gao Feng.\"You better take care of me with such hauls in the future\" laughed manager Fang, \"Now, us managers are also under great pressure. If I can somehow become a regional director of a headquarter city's sector, then I'll have things easy\".\"Yea\" nodded Gao Feng, \"However, powerful monsters are hard to deal with, my brother lost his arm\".\"Ah, yes, losing an arm.....\" sighed manager Fang as he sighed, \"Although I heard there's a treasure that can make an arm grow again. However, the price of that is extraordinarily high, so a regular fighter would never be able to obtain it\".\"Regrow an arm?\" Luo Feng's mind was clouded.Right when he became a fighter, Luo Feng also searched for such a special medicine in the internet market. However, he couldn't find any medicine that could regrow an arm or a leg. Luo Feng always thought...... that such a medicine didn't exist.\"There's such a medicine?\" Gao Feng also said out of surprise.\"Manager Fang, what is that thing? Can it regrow a leg too?\" Luo Feng also asked excitedly.Wow.His brother has been handicapped all these years. If there's a chance to let his brother stand up again, he'll do everything he can to make that a reality.\"There is. It's the legendary 'Elixir of Life'. Don't even talk about a leg or an arm, even if the lower half of your body is missing, it can grow back\" said manager Fang, \"However, this thing comes from an existence that far surpasses a horde leader--it's made from the soul of the invincible emperor level monster 'Earth Dragon'. There are just a few earth dragons spread around the entire world. So each elixir of life is extremely expensive! And it's also extremely rare; you can't find them on the internet markets. Our alliance also has none of them in stock. The price for one of them has already reached 30 billion, and there's no market for them\".\"30 billion for one? No market?\" Luo Feng's heart started beating faster.Right when he thought of his brother sitting on his wheelchair and silently looking out to the scenery outside, Luo Feng couldn't help but to clench his fist: \"No matter what...... I'll let my brother stand up again! For sure!!!\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 58": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHowever, Luo Feng knew just how hard it was to make 30 billion!A weak low level horde leader is worth around 500 million to 1 billion Chinese Dollars. Even if you hunt them alone and kill 10 horde leaders in a year..... you would probably make only around 5 to 6 billion. Also, it's extremely hard for even a wargod level fighter to kill horde leaders.The average wargod level fighter probably makes around 5 to 6 billion in a year.Even with that, you would have to work hard for six or seven years.Furthermore, he's not even a wargod level fighter yet. It was only out of luck that he was able to meet this heavily wounded 'hunter'; there's no way he can get lucky every time.\"Even though it'll be hard to make 30 billion Chinese dollars, it's not impossible with the sleeping potential in my spiritual force\".\"However, killing an earth dragon\" Luo Feng laughed bitterly in his heart.A horde leader..... is already extremely horrifying.An existence that surpasses a horde leader--the Emperor level, the strongest monsters on earth! There are also humans that surpass the wargod level. For example, the strongest fighter 'Hong' and the second strongest 'Thunder God' both surpass the wargod level. However, these existences are extremely rare!Killing an earth dragon?Even the strongest human fighters on earth can't be 100% sure that they can kill it.\"Haha, elixir of life? Captain, when one of you guys reach the level of the world's strongest fighter, 'Hong', throw some small cash at me so I can buy one elixir of life\" laughed Zhang Ke. The other members of the fire hammer squad couldn't help but to laugh. Reach the level of 'Hong'?Such a person can fight against the government's entire army alone. For these types of people, 30 billion is indeed small cash. However, how many people on this world can reach that level?\"Go, let's eat!\" laughed Gao Feng.In a restaurant on the third floor of the HR alliance market. There were dishes all over the table and the members of the fire hammer squad were all grouped in front of a laptop on the side. Captain 'Gao Feng' swiftly scanned his finger on the scanner, typed in the three one-time passwords, and entered the fire hammer squad's shared account.\"800 million Chinese dollars. As we said before, Luo Feng did all the work, so he gets the highest possible '80%'. The rest of us will split the 20%. No complaints right\" Gao Feng looked at the group.The group nodded and Luo Feng laughed.Fighter squads had all sorts of rules. Some of them try to make the members compete while others promote unity.\"Luo Feng gets 640 million, the rest of us get 32 million\" Gao Feng swiftly transferred the money.\"BEEP\"\"Transaction successful\"Notifications appeared one by one on the laptop's screen. Luo Feng lowered his head and looked at his own tactical communications watch, which displayed that his balance has increased by 640 million.\"Today, Luo Feng's treating us\" laughed Gao Feng as he yelled.\"Yea, we gotta make this rich guy pay\" said Chen Gu with an unsatisfied look, \"Jeez, just this one time and you've almost caught up to the amount of money I've made over all these years. I'm envious\".The members of the fire hammer squad were extremely cheerful as they chatted freely and ate and drank merrily.Every time they leave the wilderness, they leave the border of life and death! In the wilderness, especially in ruined cities, you're always worried. Nobody dares to relax in those cities..... since there are just way too many monster hordes and commander level monsters there.\"Drink!\"\"Come, us brothers will have a drink\"\"Feels great. Old Zhang, we've been brothers for almost ten years. Who knows how many times you've saved me on the battlefield. Well, no need to say anymore. Here, cheers!\"The people around this table were sad because Zhang Ke was retiring, but they were hopeful towards Luo Feng the spirit reader. Everybody's feelings were complicated, so they ate and drank merrily until around 9 PM. Only until then did they find a room in a nearby teahouse to rest in.In the room, everybody had a clear cup of tea in front of them.\"Zhang Ke is going to become an 'instructor' at the dojo\" said Gao Feng to the group, \"In the future, we'll have five people in our fire hammer squad! Me, Luo Feng, Chen Gu, Wei Tie, and Wei Qing! And since Luo Feng's a spirit reader, his strength surpasses mine. I'm sure his growth in the future will be even more amazing\".Nobody was unhappy because of Luo Feng's strength.A strong fighter in a squad means a higher chance of survival for the squad! The squad will have an easier time hunting monsters and make more money!For example, if Luo Feng didn't kill the hunter this time, the other members of the squad wouldn't have earned 32 million. Even though Luo Feng got the majority of the money, they still received way more money than they got from their previous earnings.\"However, out of us five, Luo Feng is the strongest. I hope that we won't be a burden to him!\" said Gao Feng.The faces of Wei Qing and Wei Tie changed slightly.Both of them were \"advanced warrior level fighters\", so they were indeed a burden.\"Captain, I'm still a rookie\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to say.\"Luo Feng, that's not what I meant\" smiled Gao Feng slightly, \"Wei Tie, Wei Qing, you brothers don't think too much either..... What I meant was that we should raise our goal for the monsters we hunt in the future! So the first goal for our fire hammer squad will be--making every member a warlord level fighter!\"\"Captain.....\" Wei Tie couldn't help but to say, \"My brother and I still have a bit to go until we reach the warlord level\"\"I know that\"Gao Feng laughed confidently, \"I have an idea, tell me what you guys think\"Luo Feng nodded, and Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and Chen Gu also listened in.\"Wei Tie, Wei Qing, Chen Gu, you three each buy one A grade genetic medicine\" said Gao Feng, \"That way, with just body fitness level, Wei Tie and Wei Qing will be able to directly enter the 'low level warlord level'. Chen Gu's power and speed will also greatly increase\".Luo Feng slightly frowned.There are currently two mainstream genetic medicines: grade A and grade B. Grade B are for regular people, which let them become fighters! However, those who rely on the genetic medicine to become a fighter will just have average strength in the future.A grade genetic medicines are for fighters to use. After using them, their strength can multiply many times! Of course, if your strength was already very high, then the genetic medicine won't be as effective.However, one A grade genetic medicine, even with the dojo's half price, costs 360 million Chinese dollars!\"Captain, I've worked for so many years and, even if I add today's earnings, I only have 430 million\" frowned Wei Tie as he said, \"With my rate of growth, it seems that a low level warlord is basically my limit. In the future, I won't have many options to make money. So if I throw all my money out right now, how much will I have left when I retire?\".People always have to think about the future.Money isn't easy to make. After working for ten or so years, he only made 430 million. And to use 360 million to buy a genetic medicine? Then wouldn't he be investing everything he worked for in that?\"Captain, I use heated weapons, so I have to spend quite a bit of money. Using 360 million like this.....\" Chen Gu was also a bit hesitant.\"No worries\"Gao Feng slightly smiled, \"You won't need that much money to buy an A grade genetic medicine. When I just became a fighter, I was also a rookie. At that time, I joined a fighter squad and made a brother for life. As of now, that brother is an advanced warlord! He has connections to get a genetic medicine for just 200 million\"\"200 million? Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and Chen Gu were shocked.\"Just, 200 million?\" Luo Feng was also completely shocked.Half price in the Limit Home's internet market is basically the lowest price you can get. Even half price needs 360 million, but Gao Feng can get it for just 200 million?\"Then I'll go ask my good buddy to buy some for us, and then you guys can pay me after I give them to you. That way, you'll believe me\" laughed Gao Feng. However, there is something he didn't tell them. Only those in his brother's internal organization can get that discount.The members of the organization also aren't allowed to sell their things to outsiders, since the organization's prices will inflate and go through other problems if that happens.However......Gao Feng was willing to give his own money so that Chen Gu, Wei Tie, and Wei Qing won't have to. Since, in terms of wealth, he has much money than all the other members in the squad.\"In the future, everyone in the squad will be warlord level\" smiled Gao Feng slightly, \"Chen Gu will be responsible for suppression, etc, Wei Tie and Wei Qing will be responsible for cleaning out the normal soldier monsters, while me and Luo Feng will go for the commander level monsters! With our squad's efficiency, we'll surely be able to kill large amounts of commander level monsters. The amount of money we'll make will be at least 10 times higher than we made in the past\".Luo Feng couldn't help but to be excited inside.According to what Gao Feng said, everyone in the fire hammer squad will become elites. A squad full of warlords, and with his spiritual force...... the power of this squad will be crazy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEven though Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and Chen Gu were surprised by their captain's suggestion, they still nodded in agreement in the end. They also knew clearly that one of the members in the fire hammer squad will grow at a rapid rate. If they can't keep up..... then in time, they'll be abandoned.After that, Luo Feng and the others split up in the HR alliance market and returned to their respective homes by train.Yang-Zhou city, Ming-Yue sector.As of now, it was already deep into the night. A fighter-only car--a Volkswagen Touareg SUV, encountered no resistance as it entered the sector.\"BEEP!\"The Volkswagen Touareg stopped in front of the entrance to the Limit Hall. Chen Gu, Zhang Ke, and Luo Feng's homes were all gathered in front of the Limit Hall's entrance. Homes of dojo instructors, like chief instructor Wu Tong, were also there.Luo Feng opened the door and got off the car. The first thing he saw was his father and mother standing and his brother sitting in his wheelchair.\"Brother!\" Luo Hua was the first to yell.\"Luo Hua, Dad, Mom\" Luo Feng hugged his parents and his brother. Luo Feng was able to feel his parent's joy. Chen Gu and Zhang Ke were also with their family members. However, the faces of Zhang Ke's wife and daughter were filled with tears.Even though they already knew beforehand that Zhang Ke lost his arm, they still cried.\"Wife, daughter, I'll be with you guys forever now\". You couldn't see any sorrow on Zhang Ke's face.\"Brother Zhang\" Luo feng stole a glance. There was an extremely high possibility of the tiger fang squad attacking the fire hammer squad because of the feud he had with Zhang Ze Hu.\"The three heroes of our dojo have returned safely. It's quite late now, so let's all get some nice rest\" laughed chief instructor Wu Tong. The group laughed as they split up and Luo Feng and his family members returned home.After returning home, Luo Feng was finally able to completely relax. On the first day he returned, he didn't train and just relaxed. Wearing his loose dojo uniform, he took a relaxing walk in the sector.Afternoon, the September sun was still ruthless.\"Luo Feng, take a trip to the dojo\" called Chen Gu through his phone, \"The captain's here\".\"Oh, I'll be right there\"Luo Feng immediately rushed towards the Dojo of Limits.In a bar on the Dojo of Limit's first floor, Luo Feng, Chen Gu, and Gao Feng were sitting together. The drapes covered the window on the side to prevent the sunlight from shining in.\"Luo Feng, here are the two 9th series throwing knives you wanted\" laughed Gao Feng as he handed them over, \"A total of 45 million. Hurry up and transfer the money, you rich man. I won't mind accepting any extra tip if you're willing to give some\".\"9th series throwing knives?\" Luo Feng immediately accepted the delicately wrapped box.After opening the box, the interior was split into two sections. Each section had a knife in it, and both of them were black. When Chen Gu and the others asked Gao Feng to help them purchase the genetic medicine, Luo Feng asked the captain to help him buy two 9th series throwing knives. Right now, good throwing knives are very important to Luo Feng!Whether throwing knives or other weapons, the prices keep going up!Throwing knives are cheap because they're small and use very little material. Even a high level horde leader level monster would have trouble destroying a 9th series throwing knife.\"Captain, I transferred 45 million\" Luo Feng directly transferred through his cell phone.\"Didn't even give a dollar extra\" said Gao Feng purposefully.\"Luo Feng, you have so much money now, so why don't you buy a better blade? A better battle uniform?\" laughed Chen Gu. He just received his genetic medicine, so he was in an extremely good mood.Luo Feng shook his head: \"Throwing knives are light and don't use much material, so I can afford them. A blade and uniform? A 9th series ghost blade is 3 billion Chinese dollars. A 9th series battle uniform is even more absurd. In total, it'll be 12 billion Chinese dollars. How can I afford that?\". The price difference between soldier level, warlord level, and wargod level weapons were indeed very large.So he'll just buy throwing knives!If even a horde leader can't rip open that battle uniform, then it wouldn't be weird for that uniform to be extremely expensive.And with his 'advanced warrior level' fitness level, even if he's wearing an 8th or 9th series battle uniform and it remains intact after the attack from a horde leader, the impact of the attack would be enough to destroy his vital organs! Even if a beggar wears robes, he wouldn't become royal. If his body is warrior level and his battle uniform is wargod level..... that's a waste of a battle uniform!\"A battle uniform is way, way more expensive than throwing knives\" laughed Gao Feng, \"Luo Feng is right. His 5th series battle uniform is appropriate for his current body fitness level\".\"Luo Feng\" said Gao Feng.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng looked towards the captain.\"Right now, Chen Gu and the two Wei Jia brothers are all going to use the genetic medicine. The genetic medicine will need around a months time to completely show its effect! And after their strength increase, they'll also need one or two months of training to get used to their stronger power. So--We'll probably rest for two or three months. After two or three months, we'll enter the wilderness again\" said Gao Feng.Chen Gu also nodded.\"I understand\" laughed Luo Feng as he nodded, \"I'll take this chance to train too. I gained quite a bit from this time's trip into the wilderness. Now that I'm back, I'll train productively\".\"Okay\" laughed Gao Feng as he nodded, \"If we want to meet again, let's meet in the main city sector. Coming here from my home takes quite a bit of time after all\".\"Alright\"Luo Feng and Chen Gu nodded.The main sector city is the center of the entire headquarter city. It's extremely convenient to go there from Yang-Zhou city or any other surrounding city.After the captain left, Luo Feng brought the two throwing knives home.That night.In Luo Feng's home's training hall, there was a transparent piece of glass with a width and length of around one meter in the middle of the ceiling. Like water, the moonlight shone through the glass. Sitting in the middle of the training hall, Luo Feng could see the infinite starry sky with a glance through the glass.\"HU~~HU~~\" the two black throwing knives were encircling Luo Feng.\"The dark, golden ball is still in my realm of consciousness, and it holds a large amount of spiritual force! It's just that my body isn't strong enough to withstand so much spiritual force\" Luo Feng thought to himself, \"So what I need to do now is to raise my body fitness level as fast as possible!\".\"As my body gets stronger, my spiritual force will naturally get stronger too! It'll keep growing until one day the dark, golden ball vanishes!\"After that, Luo Feng started practicing bitterly and seriously according to the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd instruction manual and the DVD that came with it.The technique, 'Liu Guang', the Dao Yin technique 'Nine Stage Hun Yuan', and the blade technique, 'Thunder Blade'.And Luo Feng has already completed the first stage of the thunder blade in the wilderness!\"PU!\"\"PU!\"Deep into the night, whenever Luo Feng does a chop, an uppercut, or a slash, he uses the force exertion techniques from the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd. Each attack incorporates two stages of force exertion, which means that Luo Feng's body's muscles instantly exert another force each time.Exerting another force instantly when slashing is a huge burden on your bones, muscles, cells, etc!After practicing for around half an hour, Luo Feng became so tired that he couldn't even move as he sat on the floor, the force exertions from the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdactually bring a tremendous burden on every portion of your body! After resting for five minutes, Luo Feng started practicing the Dao Yin technique\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Hun Yuan\ufffd\ufffd, the originally exhausted body, as if relaxing in a hot spring, became comfortable and soft.After practicing the blade and Dao Yin techniques, finally -Luo Feng started undergoing the most basic genetic training technique that even the most powerful fighters of the world must follow: 'Wu Xin Xiang Tian'.\"CHICHI~~\"After training, Luo Feng felt like every single cell in his body was starving. This caused the genetic energy he absorbed to be crazily swallowed up. Every time he practiced caused the limit to rise. One minute, two minutes..... as time went on, Luo Feng became more and more shocked. Finally, every cell in his body, as if stuffed with food, couldn't absorb anymore.\"The amount of genetic energy I absorbed today is double the amount I absorbed in the past!\" Luo Feng was completely astonished.\"The instruction manual said that, the more I practice the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdthe more genetic energy I'll be able to absorb. I can't believe it was this much!\" Luo Feng didn't think it would be this absurd, despite the instruction manual's explanations.When someone practices until they become so tired that they're unable to move-It means that there's too much Ru acid in their muscles, which is when all the muscles in your body become tired! The body and many other cells didn't really join in the exercise, but Luo Feng's\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdforce exertions causes the body and cells to join in too.Just like someone's appetite becomes larger after exercising a lot.When the body and cells use up lots of energy, their 'appetite' increases greatly, allowing them to absorb much more genetic energy!\"I'm only on the first stage and yet the amount of genetic energy absorbed increased by so much. How fast will I be after getting to the ninth stage? Not only will I be able to train quickly, but my blade's power will also increase greatly. No wonder you can become the strongest fighter on the entire world. Number one speed and number one body fitness\" gasped Luo Feng out of amazement.What does it mean if your body fitness level increases quickly?For Luo Feng, it means that the amount of spiritual force he'll be able to handle will also increase greatly!Starting from this day, Luo Feng approached his limits every day as he trained himself. And he finally found the best way to train, which is undergoing 'Liu Guang' as he swings his blade! The speed doesn't have to be quick, but each slash and step has to be serious. After exhaustion, he starts training his Dao Yin technique.After undergoing Dao Yin technique training, he would have restored quite a bit of strength.He'll once again train his technique and blade technique! And then undergo Dao Yin technique training again!Only in the end will he start his genetic energy training. This method of training is the most efficient! This process takes around just six complete hours, which is also the best way for Luo Feng to raise his body fitness level!Actually, with the help of the spirit reader's large amount of spiritual force, his body fitness level naturally improves quickly. And Luo Feng is also training in the world's 'ultimate' technique, the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, so his rate of improvement is even more startling. Luo Feng was improving every single day. In a blink of an eye, a month's time has passed.\"HU!\" \"HU!\" Each of Luo Feng's swings caused powerful winds to form in the training hall, which naturally dissipated when hitting against the walls. This villa was designed by the Dojo of Limits, so naturally the training hall was carefully made.\"Hm? A call from the captain?\"Luo Feng walked to the side and picked up the phone.\"Luo Feng, it's been about a month. Chen Gu, Wei Tie, and Wei Qing's strength have increased by quite a bit after using the genetic medicine. I think that we should meet a bit?\" asked Gao Feng through the phone. As of now, the strongest person in the fire hammer squad is actually Luo Feng. And Luo Feng's position will become more and more stable in the future.So Gao Feng asks for Luo Feng's opinion first.\"Alright, we haven't seen each other for a while\" laughed Luo Feng as he nodded. This past month, he has been completely obsessed with training. However, his swift improvement indeed feels really great.\"Okay, let me see. We'll go to the HR alliance market, since they have the best service\" said Gao Feng, \"When is a good time?\"\"Hm.....\"Luo Feng's heart suddenly skipped a beat as he remembered Xu Xin's words--\"In the next few days, school will start for me. But during college, I'll be the manager here on Fridays and the weekend\".\"Captain, I think we should meet this Saturday\" said Luo Feng.\"Saturday? Alright, this Saturday\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYear 2056, October 7th, Saturday, the day where the five members of the fire hammer squad agreed to meet at the HR alliance market.Noon.A coupe with beautiful curves that gave off an air of elegance slowly drove into the HR alliance market's plaza and stopped directly in front of the gate to the HR skyscraper's lobby. Luo Feng, who was wearing a casual shirt, got off the car with Chen Gu. The doorman greeted them as they entered the first floor of the building.\"Alright, please wait sir\".Luo Feng just stepped into the lobby and, with a glance, saw the professional Xu Xin in a white shirt at the far away bar smiling as she chatted with some fighters. She couldn't help but to notice a shadow approaching the bar and, with a closer look, joy appeared in Xu Xin's eyes.\"Luo Feng\" yelled Xu Xin as she smiled.\"Xu Xin\" Luo Feng smiled as he was next to the bar, \"Give me a cup of pu-er tea. Oh yea, do you have time? For us old students to chat?\".Xu Xin hesitated for a bit and then laughed as she asked the other waiter. She then walked out of the bar as she laughed: \"There aren't too many guests here today. Luo Feng, let's go chat over there\". At this time, Chen Gu, who was sitting on a couch far away, gave Luo Feng a big thumbs up.In a quiet corner of the bar, Luo Feng and Xu Xin sat face to face.\"Luo Feng, when did you come back from the wilderness? Did you just get back?\" Xu Xin sat quietly as she held a tea cup. The green tea caused the transparent cup to give off a green light.\"I've been back for a while\" answered Luo Feng.Xu Xin let out a smile and couldn't help but to laugh as she said: \"You've been back for so long and you didn't even come to see your old classmate. Or could it be..... you're looking down on me? You're the only person in my senior class that became a fighter, so I want to brag about you when you become famous one day\".\"Haha, Xu Xin, which college are you at now?\" asked Luo Feng.Luo Feng and Xu Xin, the two sat here as they chatted freely. They talked about some of the things going on in their lives right now. Even though Luo Feng had a crush on Xu Xin, which Xu Xin was aware of..... none of the two brought up that topic. They just sat here and chatted normally and quietly.Luo Feng himself was quite satisfied with chatting normally.At this time, a youth wearing a black shirt and black trousers walked out of the elevator. He glanced at the corner of the bar and saw Xu Xin and Luo Feng.\"Who's Xin talking to?\" frowned the youth as he looked carefully, \"It seems to be..... Luo Feng who was an elite student in Xu Xin's high school senior class?\". He knew a lot about those in Xu Xin's high school and has looked over the data on the famous ones like Luo Feng and Zhang Hao Bai.The youth let out a cold smile: \"Xin has brought up Luo Feng at home when we were eating before. Looks like they have some sort of relationship\".The youth quietly sat on the other side of the bar.Luo Feng was having a good time as he chatted with Xu Xin, but it seemed that someone from the bar was calling Xu Xin's name. Xu Xin stood up and apologized: \"Sorry, Luo Feng, I need to work now\".\"Don't mind me\" laughed Luo Feng.\"Xin, is this your friend?\" at this time, a man's voice rang. Luo Feng turned his head and saw a handsome youth who looked kind of similar to Xu Xin. The youth stood on the side as he smiled towards Xu Xin and then towards Luo Feng. Xu Xin was joyfully shocked: \"Brother, you came to the market today too. Yes, this is my old classmate, Luo Feng. Brother, I need to go work now, so you can chat with Luo Feng\".\"Alright, go ahead\" laughed the youth as he nodded, and then he turned his head towards Luo Feng, \"Hello, Luo Feng. let me introduce myself. I am Xu Xin's brother, Xu Gang\".Brother?If he can get Xu Xin, wouldn't this guy be his brother-in-law?\"Hello\" Luo Feng stood up to shake the other person's hand.\"Hello, Luo Feng\" laughed Xu Gang as he sat down, \"I've heard of your name a long time ago in my sister's high school and that there were only three elite members and that you were one of them! And I also heard from my sister that you're officially a fighter now?\"Luo Feng laughed as he nodded.\"Ah, how amazing, an 18 year old fighter\" praised Xu Gang, and then laughed, \"Wasn't my sister quite low-key in school?\"\"Yea, no one could tell that her family is super rich\" laughed Luo Feng. Xu Xin was indeed quite plain and quiet back then.A smile bloomed on Xu Gang's face: \"Haha, well, my grandfather is worried about the madam of the family becoming spoiled. So he let her attend a normal school instead of an elite school so that she could be together with the general population and live with them! Now that I see it, my sister has indeed performed quite well\".Luo Feng frowned a little, madam of the family? He already knew that Xu Xin was the madam of the Xu family.\"Didn't my sister tell you about her family's circumstances?\" asked Xu Gang in a confused tone.\"She didn't, but I know. The Xu family\" smiled Luo Feng calmly, \"One of the 12 families of the HR alliance in the country-\" Luo Feng understood the meaning behind Xu Gang's words. Xu Gang didn't say it himself, but used another topic to bring this subject out--Xu Xin is the madam of the Xu family!\"Oh, so you know\" said Xu Gang thankfully, \"Actually, even a large family like us has a large family's troubles. For example, sometimes we can't marry who we want to. Right now, quite a bit of gifted young men are going after my sister. Like Wang Xing Ping from Kyoto city, and the intermediate level warlord level fighter from our Jiang-Nan city that is just 21 years old, 'Guo Hai'\".Luo Feng was startled.Others going after Xu Xin?\"That Guo Hai is quite cheeky\" insulted Xu Gang as he shook his head, \"Isn't he just a warlord level fighter? What does he think he's playing at. Our Xu family has quite the position on even an international level. How can we let the madam of our family marry an unpromising fighter? Maybe that fighter will just die in the wilderness someday\".Luo Feng frowned.\"Luo Feng, don't you agree? Fighters walk on the border of life and death, so they have a high chance of dying. How can I let the madam of our family marry a fighter, right?\" laughed Xu Gang as he asked. After seeing Luo Feng's expression, he laughed as he said, \"Oh, don't get the wrong idea. I'm not talking about you\".Luo Feng was in an extremely bad mood.Not talking about me?This Xu Gang just has to bring this specific topic up, which is giving him a clear message--The madam of his Xu family has no chance of marrying a fighter that could just die to anything. So, Luo Feng, you better not get ahead of yourself.\"Actually\" said Xu Gang thankfully, \"Compared to that, I prefer that Wang Xing Ping more. Wang Xing Ping is the young master of the Wang family in Kyoto. The Wang family is also in control of large amounts of wealth. If he just stays home and gives the command, quite a bit of fighters will work for him, so he doesn't have to risk his own life\".\"As a brother, I want my sister to live a stable life\" sighed Xu Gang, \"Compared to a fighter, young masters with large amounts of wealth are the perfect match for my sister\".\"Fighter?\"\"For example, families like my Xu family and the Wang family, which one doesn't have a crowd of warlord level fighters under them? And I don't even have to mention the numerous warrior level fighters\" laughed Xu Gang as he shook his head. Xu Gang clearly doesn't care much about fighters. He cares even less about warrior level fighters.He has the capital to do so!As one of the 12 families of the HR alliance, they indeed have a large amount of warlord level fighters and an extremely massive amount of warrior level fighters.\"Luo Feng\" a sound carried from far away.Luo Feng turned his head and looked. Captain Gao Feng and the Wei Jia brothers have arrived and were sitting next to Chen Gu. Luo Feng laughed as he yelled: \"Captain, I'm coming now\".\"Young master Xu Gang\" Luo Feng laughed as he looked at Xu Gang.\"Hm?\" Xu Gang let out a smile.Actually, after saying that much, Xu Gang believed that his message has been clearly sent to the other person. His family even belittles a 21 year old intermediate level warlord level fighter. So you, Luo Feng, a rookie fighter should know his place and stop bothering my sister.\"Young master Xu Gang, your Xu family sure is great, being able to control a crowd of warlord level fighters\" smiled Luo Feng, \"However, I wonder if your Xu family can command a wargod fighter at will?\".Xu Gang froze.Wargod? How many of those are in Jiang-Nan city? His Xu family does have a wargod level fighter, but that's just because the Xu family is coaxing that fighter with large amounts of money.\"I wonder if your Xu family would be able to meet an existence that surpasses a wargod?\" followed Luo Feng.Xu Gang's face became even worse.An existence that surpasses the wargod level, like the strongest fighter, 'Hong'. An existence that equals an entire army. Even if his family wants to meet the strongest fighter on earth, they don't have the right to. And don't even talk about trying to equal them.Compared to \"Hong\" and \"Thunder God\", the Xu family is just like an ant!\"Young master Xu Gang, we count as friends, so I'll remind you..... don't look down on fighters\" Luo Feng looked at Xu Gang. Xu Gang treated him with no respect, so why should Luo Feng respect him?After saying that, Luo Feng turned his head and walked away.The cold air from the lobby's air conditioner was calming while the soft music was flowing like a river. However, there was fire in Luo Feng's heart, \"For example, families like my Xu family and the Wang family, which one doesn't have a crowd of warlord level fighters under them? And I don't even have to mention the numerous warrior level fighters\". Xu Gang's words repeated over and over again in Luo Feng's head.\"Xu Gang!\"\"Didn't you say all of this to get me to back off and stop going after your sister?\" Luo Feng's gaze was cold, \"Don't worry, I, Luo Feng, will definitely reach the peak of the fighters! A fighter that is treated equal by a government's army! At that time, I'll have your Xu family accept me with smiling faces!\"Of course, he'll go after Xu Xin......However, he'll have the Xu family accept him with smiling faces and a low profile as they do!\"Fighters, are the ultimate power of the world!\"\"The so called super families, in front of the strongest fighters, are just scum!\"In this moment!The noon of year 2056, October 7th!Luo Feng's first contact with Xu Gang caused his ambition to begin!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs he saw Luo Feng leave, Xu Gang lightly sipped from the cup in his hands and added: \"Luo Feng, oh Luo Feng. I was being polite and tried to leave you with some face by saying this! I hope you understand..... that if you continue to bother my sister, you can't blame me for using certain tools!\"Xu Gang laughed as he finished drinking the wine in his cup.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"Xin, I have some stuff to do, so I'll be going first\" said Xu Gang to Xu Xin at the bar, and then left the lobby.Third floor of the HR alliance market, one of the rooms in a tea house.\"Luo Feng\" laughed Chen Gu, \"You chatted with Xu Xin for such a long time. To me, it seems that she's a bit interested in you. Seems like it won't be too hard for you to get her! And then Xu Xin's brother came and chatted with you for such a long time. Could it be that it's because he recognizes you as a 'brother-in-law'?\".Me as a brother-in-law? Luo Feng couldn't help but to laugh, since brother Chen didn't hear what Xu Xin's brother, 'Xu Gang', said.\"Don't speak nonsense, it's mainly because we used to be classmates in the past\" laughed Luo Feng.Gao Feng couldn't help but to laugh as he said: \"Since you guys used to be classmates, then that makes it even easier for you. Don't you see that many of the couples that get married now used to be classmates?\".\"Yea, Luo Feng, keep at it\" encouraged Wei Tie dramatically as he laughed, \"That girl Xu Xin is really quite good. Quite a few fighters compliment the manager of the underground alliance's bar on fridays and weekends. Perverts all over try to play at this manager, but they're too scared given her background\".Luo Feng laughed.Play at the madam of the Xu family? The people with those kinds of thoughts in their head probably won't even know how they died.\"Captain, let's not talk about this\" laughed Luo Feng, \"Let's talk about the important things\".\"Alright\" laughed Gao Feng, \"Hey, you three. How are your body fitness levels going?\".Wei Tie put down his tea cup and was the first to speak: \"Captain, my fist strength is around 9650 kg, my speed is 102 m/s, and my reaction speed test results qualify for a 'beginner warlord'\".\"Hm, so you count as a beginner warlord now\" nodded Gao Feng.\"Captain\" Wei Qing also spoke, \"My fist strength is around 9510 kg, my speed is 106 m/s, and my reaction speed test results qualify for a 'beginner warlord'\".Both Gao Feng and Luo Feng slightly nodded.\"Haha, it's my turn\" laughed Chen Gu, \"My fist strength is around 7100 kg, my speed is 81 m/s, and for my reaction speed test results, I got excellent for a 'beginner warlord'\".\"Brother Chen's reaction speed is so quick\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to praise.Gao Feng laughed: \"He uses guns, so he already possessed a quick reaction speed in the first place. With the help of the genetic medicine this time, it became even faster. Looks like you can use guns with an even higher rate of fire now\". It was quite rare for the reaction speed of a fighter that used heated weapons to reach the beginner warlord level.And Chen Gu got a grade of excellent for a beginner warlord.\"Alright, you three. In conclusion, it seems that the effects of the genetic medicine are showing\" Gao Feng looked at Wei Tie and Wei Qing, \"Wei Tie, you brothers still have to keep working hard! Even though it's been around a month, the effects of the genetic medicine haven't completely disappeared yet. If you keep training, you can still get some of the effect out\".\"Understood\" Wei Tie and Wei Qing nodded.Gao Feng looked towards Chen Gu: \"Old Chen, it's time to change your machine gun\".\"Yea, it's time to change it\" nodded Chen Gu.Chen Gu's heated weapons are a machine gun and a heavy sniper rifle. The fastest rate of fire his machine gun is capable of is 300 rounds per minute, which is five rounds per second! With Chen Gu's old reaction speed, he could make four of these rounds hit four monsters' heads, and the final round will hit the fifth monster's body.In other words.....For Chen Gu, his machine gun is basically firing at nonmoving targets! This requires a horrifying level of reaction speed. Chen Gu's reaction speed is probably hundreds to thousands of times higher than the people before the Grand Nirvana period, so it's not weird that he is able to do this.\"I'll probably get a type RG112 heavy machine gun. It has a caliber of 12.7 mm and carries immense power\" Chen Gu's eyes lit up, \"The fastest rate of fire it can reach is 1500 rounds per minute. This machine gun is basically the gun with the highest rate of fire that a fighter who uses heated weapons can use. If the rate of fire increases even more, then there's no point\". As of now.....There are machine guns with rate of fires that can reach 7000 to 8000 rounds per minute. Some can even go above 10,000 rounds per minute!However, that's not efficient.For Chen Gu's current reaction speed, he can make sure that all 10 bullets fired in one second will hit the head of a monster. This is efficient!\"Old Chen, buy your gun and then practice with it. Make sure you get used to it\" Gao Feng slightly smiled as he nodded, \"Wei Tie, you brothers should also train at home. Even though your body fitness levels rose, you still need to transform that power into fighting strength. Make sure you're able to completely use every ounce of power\".\"No worries, captain\" nodded Wei Tie and Wei Qing.Luo Feng let out a smile as he watched this scene.This is how the fighters of China think--You should find a way to completely turn your power into fighting strength!\"Control your power skillfully\" is how people in the east think. The westerners also have their own way of thinking. As of now..... the strongest fighter on earth, 'Hong', is Chinese.The second strongest fighter, 'Thunder God', is mixed between the east and west. However, he also has some Chinese blood in him. Some of the thoughts in Chinese martial arts are very popular in today's society of fighters.\"Captain, brother Chen, brother Tie, brother Qing\" Luo Feng looked at the group and laughed as he said, \"I've bitterly trained at home for a month and I can feel that my strength has increased by quite a bit. However, I feel that the best way for me to improve my techniques is to fight against monsters!\". No matter how you swing your blade at home, you're just imagining your opponent.That way of practicing can never compare to real combat experience against a real monster.\"So, I'm going to go into the wilderness alone and practice my technique and blade technique\" said Luo Feng.\"What, alone?\" the faces of Gao Feng, Chen Gu, and the others instantly changed.\"Yes\" laughed Luo Feng as he nodded.Actually, he already had these thoughts before, but he wasn't completely certain. The words from Xu Gang have touched him. If he wants to become the strongest fighter on earth...... then he has to be decisive! So Luo Feng decided to use the most efficient way to improve his skill.\"That's too dangerous\" said Gao Feng.\"No, captain. I'm just going to the #0231 country level city next to the military's resupplying base to train myself\" explained Luo Feng, \"I won't be going to any of the other larger cities\".\"#0231 country level city? Next to the resupplying base?\"Gao Feng, Chen Gu, and the Wei Jia brothers all let out a sigh of relief. The monsters surrounding the resupplying base are pretty weak. Monsters like horde leader level ones wouldn't dare to stay in a city right next to the military's resupplying base. So..... most of the monsters in the cities surrounding the resupplying base are soldier level. There are a few commander level monsters, but they are mostly 'low level commanders'. Even 'intermediate level commanders' are very rare. Since there are barely any commander level monsters, each commander level monster has hundreds to thousands of soldier level monsters under its command.Since there are gigantic hordes of soldier monsters and barely any commander level monsters, how do the fighter squads kill them?You can say--Strong fighter squads wouldn't even bother with these kinds of cities, since there's not much of an incentive.\"Since that city is near the resupplying base\" laughed Luo Feng, \"I can hunt during the day to improve my blade technique and return to the resupplying base at night to rest\". Since it's near, and with Luo Feng's speed, he can naturally go back and forth between the country level city and the resupplying base.\"That #0231 country level city indeed doesn't have any strong commander level monsters. However, there are a ton of soldier level monsters\" Wei Tie couldn't help but to say, \"If you get surrounded.....\"\"Tie, would Luo Feng even be afraid of being surrounded?\" laughed Chen Gu.Wei Tie and Wei Qing froze, and then laughed.Monster hordes are horrifying, but spirit readers are the group of people that are least afraid of them. Not only can they attack them from the front, but just with their spiritual force, they can jump all the way to the top of an apartment building. Monsters can jump pretty high, but how can they compare to a spirit reader than can fly?\"Good idea\" Gao Feng couldn't help but to praise, \"Luo Feng, even I feel like practicing with my hammers now. However...... I don't have the power to guarantee that I'll survive in a horde\".\"Luo Feng, when are you going to leave?\" asked Chen Gu.\"If nothing happens, I'm going to prepare today and then leave tomorrow\" laughed Luo Feng, \"Captain, send me a message when you guys are ready to leave to the wilderness\".On the path of the strong, it takes one bitter step at a time to get to the peak!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySince he decided to enter the wilderness, Luo Feng naturally doesn't hesitate anymore. Afternoon in Yang-Zhou city's Ming-Yue sector, Luo Feng told his dad, mom, and brother about his plans. Ever since Luo Feng decided to become a free fighter, his father and the others have mentally prepared themselves for the fact that Luo Feng will be leaving the city often.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdNight, the starry light shone through the square shaped glass in the training hall.A video was playing on the white wall of the training hall. In the video, someone was fighting against a huge bear monster that was around 8 or 9 meters tall. As the man fought with the monster one on one, the sturdy trees fell, the mountain rocks split apart, and the ground cracked. It was a horrifying scene of destruction.The man was as fast as lightning and a sound of thunder was hidden in his blade.The video's explanation echoed through the training hall. This is one of the videos in the discs that came with the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd instruction manual.\"An A rank monster, 'Boulder Bear Statue'. Even with its gigantic body, its speed still reaches the speed of sound!\" Luo Feng listened to the explanation with his heart in shock. This is a clip of a professional who has trained in the ways of the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdand was fighting against the A rank monster 'Boulder Bear Statue'. The boulder bear statue ranks number two out of the bear type monsters.According to the level classifications--H level, G level, and F level are soldier levels.E level, D level, and C level are commander level monsters, low level, medium level, and high level respectively.B level, A level, and S level, are horde leader level!This boulder bear statue is a medium level horde leader, whose power is unrivaled. Even a cannon can't blast open its rock-like skin that's tougher than diamond! With such a huge body, its speed still manages to reach the speed of sound. Of course it'll be classified as horde leader......It's not much for its speed to reach the speed of sound. However, the power that boulder bear statue holds is much more horrifying.\"BOOM!\"After a bit, with a sound like rumbling thunder, the gigantic head of the boulder bear statue directly flew in the air.\"Are you done recording? When we get back, sell it. And don't forget the copyright fees\" teased the powerful fighter who just killed the 'Boulder Bear Statue'. The sound carried throughout the training hall. As for his face, it was clearly edited and very blurry, so nobody could tell who he was.KA!As the video ended, the screen on the wall returned to the menu, where there were large amounts of channels available.\"I wonder when I can get to the point where I can kill even a boulder bear statue in one slash!\" thought Luo Feng to himself. The super strong fighter's battle with the boulder bear statue was turned into a video, which showed that he was very confident he could easily kill the 'Boulder Bear Statue'. He's probably an advanced level wargod.The discs that came with the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdare prohibited on quite a few channels.Quite a few channels on powerful fighters are about training in the way of the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd. However, out of all the channels, only one of them has 'Thunder God' himself in it. The video about Thunder God showed him training by himself in a training hall. With just a simple training scene like that, Luo Feng couldn't tell what was so special about it.\"Clearly, there are quite a few powerful fighters training in the way of the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd all around the world\" Luo Feng looked up towards the sky out of the square shaped glass, and saw the limitless starry sky.Starting from tomorrow, he's going to start his bitter training.With a heartbeat, he turned off the projector in the training hall and went to the first floor.The door to his brother's room on the first floor wasn't completely shut. With a glance, Luo Feng saw his brother, on his wheelchair, in front of his computer desk. However, he wasn't looking at his computer, but had his head lowered and was playing with his cell phone.\"Luo Hua\" Luo Feng lightly knocked.Luo Hua raised his head and turned towards Luo Feng at the door, and couldn't help but to say: \"Brother, you don't even knock anymore?\".\"You're the one that didn't close the door completely\" laughed Luo Feng as he entered and closed the door behind him, \"What're you doing? Texting with your girlfriend?\".\"Yea\"Luo Hua let out a smile, laughed, and nodded.After Luo Feng saw his brother's goofy look, he could clearly tell that Luo Hua truly liked the girl named Xiao Nan. What this Xiao Nan looks like...... Luo Feng wasn't too sure either. However, when dad and mom push his brother's wheelchair to the park, they see the one named Xiao Nan. And it seems like she left a pretty good impression.His parents have way more experience in life and are better at judging a person. If they think she's good, then that Xiao Nan is probably actually good.\"Has Xiao Nan brought you to meet her parents?\" asked Luo Feng.\"It's way too early for that\" laughed Luo Hua as he shook his head, \"Xiao Nan is only a freshman in college this year, so she still has three or four years left before graduating. Xiao Nan isn't in a rush to tell her parents. And..... I'm handicapped. Xiao Nan probably has to think of some way to tell her parents; it'll be troublesome to just tell them directly. Most parents don't want their daughters marrying handicapped people\".As he looked at his brother's bitter face, Luo Feng's heart hurt a bit.His handicapped status...... is the scar on his brother's heart. No matter how tough he acts, he can't act with complete confidence in front of Xiao Nan. In other words, he has low self-esteem!\"Hm, well, keep at it. I'm sure her parents will be understanding\" comforted Luo Feng, \"There's no rush anyway\".......That night, Luo Feng chatted with his brother for quite a bit. After a good nights rest, he was fully equipped with his backpack, shield, and blade by dawn and was ready to head into the wilderness. And this time, alone!\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdJiang-Nan city, northern military sector.After the train stopped at the military's station, Luo Feng and some other fighters got out of the train carriage.\"The wilderness\" Luo Feng took in a deep breath as he took the trail to the resupplying base alone. Very quickly, he arrived at the resupplying base.\"Luo Feng, just you?\"The guardsman at the resupplying base's gate looked at the message displayed by the scanner and then looked towards Luo Feng with a shocked expression, \"You were with the fire hammer squad before. How come you're alone now? Coming to the wilderness alone is very dangerous\".\"Haha, am I looking for death? I've been to the wilderness before, so I know the dangers. Hurry and give me the key\" laughed Luo Feng.\"You have a point, you've been here before so you know the dangers\".The guardsman laughed as he handed over a key, \"H322. Since you're alone, I gave you a small sized villa\". The fire hammer squad went to a larger villa, since they were a squad. One person naturally doesn't need that much space.\"Oh yeah, the name's Wang. It's fine if you call me brother Wang. Luo Feng, if you ever get any materials from monsters, you're welcome to sell them to me. I'll be sure to give you a satisfying price\".\"Alright\"Luo Feng received the key and headed towards his villa.Beside the window on the second floor of one of the villas in the resupplying base, a few men were looking down as they watched Luo Feng walk past.\"It's Luo Feng!\"\"It's Luo Feng from the fire hammer squad. Captain, should we take this chance to take him out?\". The one who said that was indeed Zhang Ze Hu of the tiger fang squad.The tiger fang captain walked beside the window and looked down silently. Luo Feng quickly left his field of vision. The tiger fang captain coldly said: \"How come he's alone? Did you guys see the other members of the fire hammer squad?\".\"We didn't see them\" the other members of the squad shook their heads.\"Luo Feng's alone\" said Zhang Ze Hu confidently, \"I saw him enter the resupplying base's gates alone; I didn't see anyone else with him\".With that, Zhang Ze Hu's eyes lit up: \"Captain, we were the ones who made the first move against the fire hammer squad. Most importantly, the fire hammer squad knows that we were the ones who did it, so we're enemies now. You said so yourself, that we need to completely destroy this enemy to stop them from threatening us anymore\".\"Yea\" the others nodded in agreement.The most dangerous thing about making a move on others in the wilderness isn't the act itself, but the chance of them surviving and finding out who did it!\"Don't rush\"The tiger fang captain spoke coldly, \"Yes, we have to destroy them completely. When we get the chance, we have to obliterate the fire hammer squad. However..... Luo Feng is alone. He's just a normal warrior level fighter! Once he enters the wilderness, he's sure to stay in a safe area\".\"It won't benefit us much to kill him. In fact, it'll just stir them up\"The other squad members nodded in agreement. What the captain said made sense.\"The person who poses the largest threat against us is actually twin hammer Gao Feng!\" said the tiger fang captain seriously, \"Gao Feng himself is quite strong; he's about my level. And he's been in this field for ten or so years already, so he has many connections and knows quite a bit of strong people...... If he really goes all out on us, we will suffer too!\".\"So, don't act unless completely necessary. If we act, we have to kill Gao Feng first! After that, we can take out the little shrimps\" said the tiger fang captain indifferently.Clearly, the tiger fang captain didn't take the other members of the fire hammer squad seriously at all.\"The captain's right\" nodded Zhang Ze Hu. After that, he laughed coldly as he glanced out, \"We'll graciously let this shrimp Luo Feng live for just a bit longer\".......In the H322 villa of the resupplying base, there were three bedrooms, two lobbies, and one large bathroom. Luo Feng took off his equipment, took a bath, and then put on a relaxing robe.\"Hello, I'd like a portion of the #12 meal with three dishes and soup. Also, change the drink to tea\" Luo Feng hung up and laid on the sofa.\"After lunch, I'll head out towards the #0231 country level city\" Luo Feng's heart suddenly skipped a beat, \"I'm going to train bitterly for around two months, going back and forth between the city and the resupplying base. I might bump into the tiger fang squad sometime. Hmph, if I see them, I'll follow them secretly!\".Right when he thought about their act towards his squad, Luo Feng's heart was filled with unlimited killing intent! This kind of killing intent has no hesitation at all.\"When we get to the wilderness, I'll directly obliterate them\" Luo Feng's gaze scanned the area outside of the window, \"Tiger fang squad...... I hope that I'll be able to bump into you guys during these two months!\".As for the tiger fang squad, Luo Feng didn't take them seriously at all.With his current strength, it'll be enough to destroy the entire tiger fang squad!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After that, Luo Feng left the fighter resupplying base.Today was a dark day.\"The air is quite fresh though\". Without wielding his blade, Luo Feng headed into the wilderness. The piece of wilderness in front of him was probably farmland in the past. However, after a few decades, it has been filled with weeds. Luo Feng searched for a path with the shortest weeds to continue on.After getting past that part and walking for around half an hour on the old, ruined highway, he arrived at the #0231 country level city.\"PU!\"Luo Feng cut off the tail of a lion mastiff, took the tendon out, and then put the tendon in his bag. From the resupplying base to the country city, in just a short trip of 100 miles, Luo Feng already killed around a dozen normal soldier level monsters.\"Free training every day where I can even earn money off of it. Where would you find something like that?\" smiled Luo Feng slightly as he continued to walk in a ruined residential sector. There were quite a few monsters lurking around in this deserted sector. Luo Feng raised his head and spotted a monster's shadow on the third floor of a residential apartment in front of him.\"Officially begin training!\"Luo Feng ferociously stepped on the floor, causing a rumbling sound and splitting open the concrete floor, and flew towards the balcony of that third floor like a cannon ball.Days of slaughter, begin!......After a few days, most of the monsters in the city have already perished since Luo Feng started lurking in this #0231 country level city. Unlike other monsters, Luo Feng doesn't kill them immediately. He'll first fight with them for a bit for practice and then take action! Luo Feng always brings a bulging bag of the most important materials from the monsters back to the resupplying base.The resupplying base's Wang Wei was also very astonished by Luo Feng's efficiency.Luo Feng's 3rd day of training.\"Hm, looks like you killed 198 monsters today, around a dozen less than yesterday. And most of these are high level soldiers. I'll round it up for you, 1.5 million, how's that sound?\".Luo Feng's 7th day of training.\"Damn, Luo Feng, you're crazy. You killed 210 monsters today too? Hm, I'll give you a price of 1.6 million! It's not like we only traded once or twice, so I'll tell you now brother: killing soldier level monsters isn't that easy! Many of them form hordes, so you won't be so successful every time. Make sure you don't get surrounded\".Luo Feng's 16th day of training.\"Crazy*, 182 monsters, just around average today? However, the quality of the materials are pretty good, and there are even snake type monsters. Hm, I'll give you 1.5 million\".*TL note: As in Luo Feng's nickname.Luo Feng's 21st day of training.\"Crazy, tell me, have you found a certain location where soldier level monsters act independently? And when you kill them, another one will quickly appear?\".......The fighter resupplying base wasn't that large, so it was impossible to hide. Rumors about Luo Feng quickly spread around the entire resupplying base, about a crazy person who kills soldier level monsters every day for money! Using quantity over quality. One low level commander level monster could be worth around 10 million, but you can quickly catch up to that price with a thousand high level soldier level monsters.However--Killing a thousand high level soldiers is much more difficult than killing one low level commander!Most soldier level monsters act in hordes, so it's extremely rare to find them acting independently.\"That crazy Luo Feng, he's killing soldier level monsters like mad. How does he do it? How is he able to kill so many in a day?\"\"Who knows. And even if someone knew the secret, who'd be willing to tell. However, I heard that he's able to earn around a million every day, nearing two million. If this goes on, he'll be able to make 50 to 60 million in a month! In a year, that's 500 to 600 million, which is comparable to powerful warlord level fighters\".\"365 days a year, killing soldier level monsters like crazy every day? No human can take that\"\"Don't know, but that crazy has been going on like this for a month\"There were tons of people discussing about Luo Feng in the resupplying base.For the warrior level fighters, they admired Luo Feng. Warrior level fighters aren't able to make money that easily. Even advanced warriors like Zhang Ze Hu and the Wei Jia brothers only make around 50 to 60 million in a year. For the beginner and intermediate levels, 10 million a year is pretty good. And Luo Feng earns 50 to 60 million in just one month!Crazy!Of course, for the warlord fighters, they're just amazed for a bit. They wouldn't waste their time on things like this.As for the powerful wargod fighters that occasionally enter the resupplying base, they would just sigh: \"This kiddo is quite crazy. Interesting\".\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd11/29/2056, the sky was dark and the winds were harshly blowing.On the first floor in some city market, ten huge horned boars were howling as they continuously mobbed one youth. The howling kept rumbling throughout the city and a few shelves were already smashed into pieces. The horned boars were completely enraged and attacked crazily!The youth had a hexagonal shield in one hand and a ghost blade in the other. He swayed like a butterfly while his movements caused a few afterimages to appear.One word, quick!\"Attack!\"Luo Feng, who kept dodging, instantly moved the ghost blade in his hand. In this instant, a few slight sounds like thunder could be heard. Oh, indeed, they said that once your blade reaches a certain level, the air around it will start making this sound. The blade drew across the neck of every horned boar with unrivaled accuracy. Combining that with his footwork caused the power to be even more amazing.Even though there were many horned boars, only two or three could attack Luo Feng at the same time.Every time he killed one or two, Luo Feng was always able to use the corpses of the monsters to find some opening and avoid getting slammed by the monster horde. Even many warlord fighters can't handle their surroundings so accurately.\"PU!\"The fresh blood of the horned boar shot out like water from a fountain. In just a moment, half of the couple dozen horned boars were killed, and another ten horned boars ran away after things turned bad.\"This isn't good. If it's not a high level soldier, it's not worth money\" Luo Feng picked out 19 high level soldiers out of all the corpses of the horned boars. He cut off their horns and put them into his bag, \"The horns of a high level soldier are worth around 8,000 dollars if I sell them to the underground alliance\".As for the other corpses of the horned boars, Luo Feng was too lazy to bother with them.However, Luo Feng didn't really like collecting the horns of the horned boars. Not only were they a bit heavy, but their prices were just average. Since his bag has limited space, he only collects materials from around 75% of the monsters he killed. The actual number of monsters he killed every day was over 300.It couldn't be helped, who was the one that made the reproduction rate of the boar type and dog type monsters so high.After leaving the city that reeked of blood, Luo Feng came to the roof of a normal six story residential apartment to rest.\"After training for the past 50 days, my technique barely steps into the 'Ru Wei class'\". Luo Feng didn't use all of that training to just kill. Every time he fought with a small group of monsters, Luo Feng first undergoes technique training, and then he kills them.This way, Luo Feng's efficiency would be very high.Of course...... in the past 50 days, Luo Feng was in danger around 20 or so times. Since the howls of the dying monsters occasionally attracts even more monsters. Facing a few hundred to even over a thousand enraged monsters, Luo Feng could only use his spiritual force to flee in panic!You could say, without his spiritual force, Luo Feng would've died around 20 times already!But it was because he possessed his spiritual force that Luo Feng was able to use such an insane training method. For over 8 hours a day every day, he's surrounded by large amounts of enraged monsters! The effects of one day of Luo Feng's training could equal a month of an average fighter's training in the wilderness. And an average fighter only enters the wilderness a few times a year.With these 50 days of training, along with the Liu Guang technique from the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, Luo Feng finally barely steps into the 'Ru Wei class'.\"My technique steps into the Ru Wei class\"\"However, my blade is still only on the first stage of the thunder blade\". Luo Feng constantly tried to unleash the second stage, but unfortunately, he couldn't! However, who knows how much more control Luo Feng has over his power. Know that.....In the past 50 days, Luo Feng killed over ten thousand monsters!Ten thousand monsters. Most fighters wouldn't kill that many monsters in their entire lives. Such an enormous amount was what created Luo Feng's precise, clean, and sharp blade technique!The biggest thing Luo Feng gained from the past 50 days was experience. The experience of fighting on the border of life and death, remaining calm, and making decisions! Now he is able to calmly find a chance in a battle to the death, and attack! Every fighter training in the Ru Wei class possesses this ability.\"It's already 5 PM, time to go back\"Luo Feng took a look at his tactical communications watch, and directly jumped off the roof with his backpack on his back......A few moments later.Luo Feng was in a pretty good mood as he walked along the highway. Suddenly, he felt a tremor and couldn't help but to turn his head. What he saw were three shadows panicking as they sprinted far away on the highway. Sometimes they would sprint and sometimes they would leap over 10 meters far; these shadows were extremely quick!\"The one running in front is...... Wan Dong?\"With a glance, Luo Feng recognized one of the three that were running. He was precisely the Wan Dong that was the only one in the fighter combat exam able to compete with him!And behind them were a dark mass of monsters. Each of the monsters were only around 30 cm large, just barely larger than a human's palm. However, these little monsters formed a sea of monsters, causing Wan Dong and the other two to drop their blades, shields, etc. and sprint for their lives!\"A rat tide?\" Luo Feng was shocked. Even a wargod level fighter has no chance of surviving after being surrounded in the infinite rat tide, also known as the rat disaster.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe black rat tide seemed infinite, and was wide enough to cover the whole highway. It seemed to stretch on for over 100 meters. With each rat monster being 30 cm in length, there were definitely over ten thousand monsters in this rat tide. And this rat tide counts as a small one. Even a wargod will die if he gets caught in it!So Luo Feng only had one choice......\"Run!\" Luo Feng immediately started sprinting on the highway.\"HU, HU, HU~~\"Wan Dong and the other two had threw away their blades, shields, and other weapons a long time ago. Each of them were sprinting as the rat tide behind them chased incessantly. The distance between them shortened from 20 meters, to 15 meters, 14 meters, 13 meters.....\"Fuck!\"\"What's taking the army so long!\"\"If they don't come soon, we're dead\"Wan Dong and the others cursed in their hearts and clenched their teeth as they accelerated, increasing the distance between them and the rat tide. They directly pulled away to 30 meters. Only after that did Wan Dong and the other two start decelerating.\"I can't run anymore\"\"Me neither\"Wan Dong and the other two exchanged glances, and all of them were in bitter pain. Their maximum sprint speed is way faster than this rat tide, but since it's their maximum, they won't be able to maintain it for long! For example, it was pretty good for the humans before the Grand Nirvana period to run 100 meters in 10 seconds.100 meters, in around 10 seconds.But what about 1,000 meters? Can they do that in 100 seconds?10,000 meters? Could they do it in 1,000 seconds? In fact, before the Grand Nirvana period, the record for the males 10,000 meter run was around 1,580 seconds.Fighters now are the same. Wan Dong and the others can run 60 m/s in their maximum sprint speed, but they've been running for nearly half an hour now. Right now, they can barely keep up a speed of 40 m/s! Only when the rat tide nears them do they force themselves with their lives on the line to run faster!Wan Dong and the others have ran about 300 miles! One could imagine how tired they are!\"Hurry up and come, army\"\"This is pretty close to the resupplying base, how come the army still isn't here\" Wan Dong and the other two were starting to lose feeling in their legs; their muscles were too tired to run any faster.And Luo Feng maintained an astonishing speed of 60 m/s while carrying his blade and shield. Wan Dong and the other two have used up most of their energy, but Luo Feng is still in peak condition!Luo Feng was already pretty far from the rat tide, so he quickly lost them.\"Eh?\" with a glance, Luo Feng saw a deep blue shadow coming from far away in the sky. At first, he thought it was some sort of flying monster, but as the deep blue flying object neared, Luo Feng realized what it was. It was some sort of flat, round, saucer shaped military aircraft!Most of the military's aircraft are made in this shape, since it's easier to attack and defend against flying monsters in the air.\"Army!\"\"It's the army's aircraft!\" the exhausted trio suddenly gave an excited yell, and each of them started accelerating.Luo Feng, who was still sprinting, also slowed down. He raised his head and watched the military aircraft rush towards the monster horde. When it was around 100 meters above the ground, it started hovering perfectly above the monster horde. With Luo Feng's eyesight, he saw a gigantic cannon come out of the bottom of the aircraft.\"RUMBLE~~~\"A neverending flame started ferociously shooting out the cannon, directly covering the rat tide below. The temperature of the flame was probably a couple thousand degrees, and most of the rat monsters were burned alive. Suddenly, the usually neat rat tide crumbled entirely. They ran in all directions while giving off horrified yells.However, under the cage of flame, most of the rat monsters were directly burned to death. A portion of the rat monsters ran into the abandoned fields beside the highway, directly burrowed into the ground, and disappeared.\"You four fighters, a grade 3 rat tide has emerged in a thousand mile radius. Please return to the resupplying base. It's not too late to come back to the wilderness after the rat tide alert has been called off\" a sound carried from the aircraft. Suddenly, it split the air as it flew away, headed off to save the other fighters.Wan Dong and the other two let out a deep, long breath.\"We've kept our lives\"\"We were so close to being finished\". These three were extremely tired.\"Luo Feng\" Wan Dong couldn't help but to yell into the distance, \"Anything to eat? Give us something to eat! To drink?\"Luo Feng laughed as he came over. The Wan Dong in front of him wasn't cold and sullen like before. He was exhausted, and filled with joy! After sprinting for his life for around 300 miles, his body used up an astonishing amount of energy. Luo Feng took out a bag from the side pocket of his backpack and took out three balls: \"These three are high energy candies, hm, and here's a sack of water\".Luo Feng handed them over, and each of them swallowed the high energy candy. The water in the sack was split up and quickly finished.\"Luo Feng, thanks\" said Wan Dong thankfully, \"Let me introduce to you. The one beside me is called Wang Ke. The other is called Jiang Tu\".\"I've long heard about Crazy's famous name\" said the handsome Wang Ke as laughed.\"Crazy, your one high energy candy tastes better than the most expensive delicacy. I was starving, but now I feel much more comfortable\" said Jiang Tu, who had a huge beard.Luo Feng walked and chatted with Wan Dong and the other two.\"How'd you guys encounter the rat tide? That military aircraft said, a grade three rat tide?\" the city Luo Feng was in was too close to the resupplying base, so he didn't have a chance to personally experience the rat tide.\"I've finally seen how powerful the rat tide is\" Wan Dong couldn't help but to say, \"Before, we were resting on the rooftop of a residential apartment in a country city, but suddenly, large amounts of rat monsters appeared all over the entire city. It was truly infinite! We were so scared that we immediately used steel wires to escape from rooftop to rooftop, we didn't dare to go down!\".Luo Feng was astonished, he was completely able to imagine a scene with an uncountable amount of rat monsters appearing in a country city.\"Thankfully, our squad was in the suburbs of the country city. We clenched our teeth, picked an alley with the fewest rat monsters, and ran for our lives!\".\"However, on the way, we encountered another rat tide. We didn't have a choice, our squad could only split up and run, making the rat tide split too! We were lucky, we ran to the highway and only a small rat tide was chasing us! While running, Wang Ke and I met this Jiang Tu guy. He pretty much went through the same experience we did\".Wan Dong laughed bitterly as he said: \"I wonder how captain and the others are doing\".In a place with many streets and alleys, they could split up and run, causing the rat tide to split up too. However, they didn't dare do such a thing on the highway, since only the abandoned fields were beside it. It's harder for humans to sprint in these fields. And the geographical environment of the fields doesn't really have much of an impact on the rat monsters.That's why everyone runs on the highway and aren't willing to enter the abandoned fields.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdLuo Feng and the others arrived in the fighter resupplying base. At this time, a large amount of fighters were gathered at the gate of the base.\"Crazy, I knew that you wouldn't die\"\"Crazy, did you see old Liu and the others in the #0231 country level city?\"As he walked into the resupplying base, quite a few fighters who recognized Luo Feng came to give their greetings and ask questions, since a rat tide explosion is an extremely dangerous case. Thankfully, this was just a 'grade three rat tide', so it wasn't too dangerous. If it was the legendary grade one rat tide, then even the entire Jiang-Nan headquarters city would be in danger!\"Old Wang, have my captain and the others returned yet?\" Wan Dong started asking around.\"Haven't seen them\"\"Your captain and the others aren't back, it's not recorded here\"......Today was a sad day for the resupplying base. Quite a few fighters lost their lives. As for the three wargods that entered the wilderness today, one of them was actually surrounded by the infinite rat tide and was lost in it.The rat tide crazily attacked with all they had, and..... killed a wargod!Yes, today, a human wargod has fallen!There aren't just soldier level rat monsters in the rat tide, there are also commander level existences. And the leader of the rat tide is extremely intelligent, once they select a target, they'll disregard everything else! It was said that while that human wargod was struggling, around ten skyscrapers were destroyed, causing millions of rat monsters to die.Sadly, millions of rat monsters means nothing to the rat tide which contains billions.Because of that......This wargod died!\"RUMBLE~~~\" the dark clouds rolled and the harsh winds covered the entire land. Sometimes, the sound of thunder could be heard, and with one of the thunder's explosion, heavy rain started pouring.On the rooftop of a villa in the resupplying base, Luo Feng sat on the balcony.\"Captain, I'm fine, I was pretty lucky. Didn't get surrounded by the rat tide\"\"Brother Chen, yea, I'm fine\"\"Brother Tie, haha, you can hear my voice. Of course I'm fine\"Luo Feng received several phone calls, since a grade three rat tide event only appears around once a generation. Because of that, most of the fighters in Jiang-Nan city knew what happened. Every time a rat tide case occurs, or the even more horrifying 'ant tide', many human fighters die. In this case, a human wargod has fallen. A big loss to the entire Jiang-Nan city.\"Just a grade three rat tide caused so many people to die\"\"Then what about the legendary grade one rat tide?\"\"Or the legendary war between humans and monsters?\"The war between humans and monsters, is the war between two civilizations, the war between two races! Once the war begins, countless kinds of monsters appear. Ground monsters, all sorts of flying type monsters, monsters that use quantity of quality, monsters with immeasurable power, burrowing monsters, poisonous monsters, monsters with flying attacks and sound wave attacks......The ground and the sky are covered with countless monsters. There are also burrowing monsters in the ground, and monsters in the lakes.Things like the rat tide and the ant nest are just a portion of them.This is the most horrifying war!\"Monsters are the enemies of us humans. Right now, the monsters have complete control over the sea. On the ground, humans have the advantage. However, monsters have the advantage in the sky! Humans are forced into headquarter cities and to counter attack from there!\" Luo Feng never realized this in the past. He always felt like monsters were just being slaughtered by fighters, but today he finally realized......Monsters are entirely capable of wiping humanity off the face of the earth.If humanity goes extinct, what's the point of talking about family, what's the point of talking about cultures, ethics, and morals?\"My strength isn't enough. Not even close to enough\" Luo Feng gazed at the infinite sky and earth.BOOM!KA!The thunder roared, and a flash of lightning came crashing down from the sky.\"Thunderbolt.....\" Luo Feng stared at the lightning in the faraway sky and suddenly grasped something in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

CRACKLE!\"Lightning bolt after lightning bolt came crashing down from the sky. Sometimes two flashes of light will wrap around each other like snakes in the sky to form a lightning bolt. Even a horde leader wouldn't want to get hit by the almighty lightning bolt. The astonishing voltage would probably instantly turn them into dust.\"Fierce! Sharp!\"\"Destroying everything!\"Luo Feng sat on the balcony of the rooftop as he muttered while watching silently.With Luo Feng's technique training these past days, his technique finally barely steps into the 'Ru Wei class'. As for his blade technique, Luo Feng is only able to control his sword's power. After killing over 10,000 monsters, and adding the amount of control that the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd already needs, Luo Feng's current control over his blade is already way above Wei Tie and Wei Qing's.However.....Luo Feng wasn't able to complete the second stage of the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd. He has always wanted to complete the second stage. Know that this instruction manual is extremely powerful. The first stage gives you 140% of your original power, but the 2nd stage gives you 210%. It gives you a full 50% increase from the power in the 1st stage.In other words, an advanced level warrior can wield the strength of a beginner level warlord!And the ninth stage of the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdis 700%, which is 7x the original!An advanced warrior can wield the power of a beginner level warlord! This is the power of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd. However, the only person who has mastered all nine stages in the entire world is the creator, Thunder God.\"Yea, like this\"Luo Feng, who was always practicing his blade technique, watched the lightning before him. As he watched, he grasped something in his heart. After a short moment, he immediately went down to the 2nd floor to get his ghost blade. After that, with his ghost blade in hand, he started practicing in the heavy rain on the rooftop!The lightning in the distance started dying down.\"According to the explanation from the instruction manual, every blade master has their own conception. According to the scroll, you have to raise the limits of your blade technique to advance in the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd\".\"This lightning bolt.....\"Luo Feng started swinging his blade over and over in the heavy rain!XIU!Unlike before, Luo Feng was trying to grasp the feeling in his heart while training. The feeling he felt when he watched the lightning bolts. The quick, explosive, and extremely concise feeling. Luo Feng's blade drew a light as it slashed around.\"Burst, burst, burst out!\" Luo Feng tried to follow the feeling in his heart to unleash another force from his body.\"It should be like this, but, how come I can only unleash the first stage and not the second?\"......The rain was pouring, but Luo Feng was completely immersed in the world of his own blade; he had no time to worry about rain. And tonight, Luo Feng surprisingly didn't undergo any 'genetic energy' training. He just kept unleashing the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd. However, doing this over and over again caused Luo Feng's body to become very tired.But Luo Feng didn't want to stop. So every time he swung his blade, he simply paused a bit before swinging again.......Dawn of day two. The rain has stopped a long time ago and a faint glow started to appear from the sky in the east. The winter's chill was already quite apparent at dawn, but Luo Feng, who was completely wet, hugged his blade as he sat on the balcony and frowned: \"Just what am I missing?\".Luo Feng himself thought that he should be able to unleash the second stage. Even the inner parts of his body were already starting to unleash a second force, but every time it seemed like it was about to come out, it fell short in the very end!Just missing by a bit.\"DRIP!\"A droplet of rain fell right into a puddle on the balcony of the rooftop. The calm surface of the water rippled and gently spread to all directions.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng felt something in his heart.An idea appeared in his mind. The scene he witnessed with the destructive lightning bolts..... that was extremely sharp!However, the ripples caused by a droplet of rain were extremely gentle.\"Just not for long!\"\"Your body fitness level can only go so high. The ninth stage is there to give you an explosive strength seven times greater than your own. However, if you keep pushing towards that limit, how could your body withstand that?\" Luo Feng eagerly stood up and, with his ghost blade in hand, directly slashed across the area in front of him. The blade moves relatively quickly in its first movement.However, instantly add another force! And another! Add two of them consecutively!The blade slashed across the air!\"RUMBLE~\" a sound rang.Luo Feng's right arm, for an instant, basically bulged up for a bit, clearly becoming larger than his left.\"Just like that\" Luo Feng retracted his blade and had a joyful smile on his face. Just like the smooth, gentle surface of water, the deepest parts of his body's muscles naturally connected the two forces. And these two forces instantly increased the ghost blade's speed to an amazing heights, like lightning!Second stage of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, finally completed!Just with his blade technique, Luo Feng is able to reach the strength of a low level warlord. Adding his Ru-Wei class technique to that, even a regular low level warlord wouldn't be a match for him.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIn extreme joy, Luo Feng ran down the stairs and immediately ordered breakfast through the phone. He happily and cheerfully finished his breakfast and prepared to undergo genetic energy training.\"Not right\"\"My blade did get stronger, but it only has brute force\" Luo Feng shook his head and immediately picked up his ghost blade again, \"I am perfectly capable of controlling exactly when I exert the two forces. That way, I can make my blade less predictable\".Luo Feng started swinging his blade in the training hall.Since he exerts his force two more times, Luo Feng's blade changes two more times. This is the difference between someone training in the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd and an average person.\"HU~HU~\" the blade was weird and erratic.Swing, and again!The images of the lightning bolts crashing down from the sky kept appearing in Luo Feng's mind. And the images of the water droplet causing the ripples, this was the feeling he was searching for everytime he swung his blade! He needs to find a blade technique for himself! The \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdsimply gives him a technique to increase his force.Luo Feng needs to experience and find a blade technique that most suits him.And he needs to conceive a technique that can let his body withstand the force of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd with no drawbacks.......Immersed in the creation of his technique, the fatigue of his muscles didn't affect Luo Feng's excitement at all. Every time he swung his blade, the technique became more and more erratic. The blade even occasionally made light shockwaves from the two faint vibrations it received when drawing through the air.Luo Feng had no idea of how much time has passed.....\"XIU!\"The blade drew a light like lightning and like fog. It had some sort of feeling similar to a misty trance. But in just that instant, the blade, like a lightning bolt, disappeared.\"It's that!\" Luo Feng finally had a smile on his face. When he casually swung his blade, the muscles of his body were relaxed. He would then instantly exert a force and then go back to the relaxed state. Changing states like this over and over again will allow Luo Feng to be able to fight for a longer duration in battle.\"According to the instruction manual, I finally got past the basic part and started on the part of conception. I just barely touched the border though\" Luo Feng was extremely happy.What should I call my technique?\"Since I got my inspiration for this technique from watching lightning, I'll call it.....\"\"Thunderbolt!\"Luo Feng finally had his own technique.\"Even though my blade technique, thunderbolt, was just created, I'll keep improving it in the future\" said Luo Feng silently. He lowered his head and looked at his tactical communications watch. It was already 2 PM. From last night until now, he spent almost 20 hours practicing his blade technique.\"In just a few days, the fire hammer squad will assemble. My technique and my blade technique have improved, so I'll go back and rest for a few days\". Luo Feng was in a joyful mood. After eating lunch, he gathered his things and got on a train headed to Jiang-Nan city from the resupplying base.Around 50 days of training and killing over 10,000 monsters enabled Luo Feng's technique and blade technique to reach new heights.And the blade technique he created, 'Thunderbolt', has finally taken shape today.Even though it was simple and plain, he created it when he was just 18 years old. Nobody could say what kind of level the blade technique, 'Thunderbolt', was capable of reaching.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYang-Zhou city's Ming-Yue sector, Luo Feng's home.In the lobby, Luo Feng was currently merrily eating dinner with his parents and brother. Luo Feng only stayed in the wilderness for seven or eight days the first time he went. However, this time he was gone for nearly two months. Even though they kept in touch via phone, the joy of actually meeting Luo Feng way surpasses talking through a phone.After dinner, Luo Hua's room.\"Luo Hua, what are you writing?\" laughed Luo Feng as he asked after seeing a word document on his brother's laptop with a lot of words on it.\"Reviewing the losses in last month's stock and patching up my theory on the stock market\" laughed Luo Hua as he replied, \"Brother, this main theory of mine actually took a few months to build up. However, to actually complete it will take much much longer than that\".Luo Feng laughed: \"Luo Hua, don't tell me about this. I have no idea what you're saying anyway. Oh yea, how have the stocks been the past three months?\".\"They haven't been good, a huge drop of 10%. However, the stock I chose count as quality stocks, so with some manipulation, I was able to earn around 50% in the last three months\" said Luo Hua with a face of confidence. After seeing that, Luo Feng also let out a smile. Actually, Luo Feng also researched a bit about stocks on the internet.As of now, the stock market is completely globalized. However, the situations in each region are different. The stock market could entirely collapse and some regions could undergo inflation. Some places could be attacked by monsters and undergo astonishing deflation.Under these random situations, it's extremely hard to trade stocks.\"Oh, in other words, you earned 10 million?\" said Luo Feng in a surprised tone. Since Luo Feng earned a lot from the 'hunter' three months ago, he lent his brother 20 million. Even though he had faith in his brother, it would be too risky to lend him too much money.\"Hm, pretty good\"Luo Feng took out his phone, quickly entered the internet bank, and made a transaction.\"BEEP!\"Luo Hua took out his phone and was shocked. He received a message saying that his balance has changed--\"Your card ending in 3206 has increased by 50 million on 11/30 21:51\ufffd\ufffd.\"Brother, 50 million?\" said Luo Hua out of shock as he looked towards his brother Luo Feng. 50 million was no small number. As of now, Chinese dollars are quite valuable. The exchange rate between the earth dollars is only around 3.5. Even for many rich Chinese businessmen and merchants, making them pull out 50 million isn't too realistic.\"Luo Hua, keep working, I'm sure you can do it\" laughed Luo Feng.Luo Hua's eyes flashed and he nodded seriously.Controlling such a huge amount of money as he entered the stock market gave Luo Hua a sense of accomplishment. For a handicapped person like him, he has made the stock market his career a long time ago. He has played through all types of stocks since a few years ago, and is finally confident in what he does.You can say, he already has the foundation of a master.However, even a master can fail in the stock market. Because of this, there is a lot of psychological pressure.\"Don't stay up too late\" said Luo Feng as he laughed and went downstairs.50 million, Luo Feng didn't really mind. His training in the past two months has earned him over 80 million. The amount of money he made was admirable to many fighters, but unfortunately, they can't learn Luo Feng's method..... Luo Feng is a spirit reader. And if Luo Feng really wanted to make money, he could use his spiritual force to kill large amounts of commander level monsters.......Last night was stormy, but tonight, the stars were bright. The starlight shone through the glass in the second floor's training hall. Luo Feng was swinging his ghost blade over and over again at an extremely high frequency. And every time he swung his blade, he pushed himself to his limit to unleash the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, and since he bitterly practiced for 20 hours straight in the resupplying base, swinging his blade at an extremely high frequency would tire him out in just 30 minutes.After that, Luo Feng would undergo his Dao-Yin technique training, 'Nine Stage Hun Yuan'.Finally, he would undergo the genetic energy training 'Wu Xin Xiang Tian'.\"CHICHI~~\" Luo Feng, who was undergoing 'Wu Xin Xiang Tian', sat cross-legged and couldn't help but to let out a face of joy. He clearly felt that all the cells in his body were crazily gobbling up the cosmic energy, \"After finishing the first stage of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, my training rate almost doubled! And now, after completing the second stage of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, every cell in my body became even more hungry and can absorb even more genetic energy\".Time passed minute by minute.After a while.As if all the cells in his body joyfully burped, none of them could absorb anymore and were completely satisfied.\"After finishing the first stage, my training rate doubled! After finishing the second stage, even though my training rate didn't raise as much as the first time, it still increased by around 30%!\" Luo Feng was amazed. The \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd was indeed amazing and unrivaled. With that Dao-Yin technique, his training rate increased even more.\"I trained bitterly at home for a month and then trained in the wilderness for two more months. I wonder how much my strength has increased from these past three months\" thought Luo Feng expectantly.Indeed, Luo Feng was improving rapidly every single day for the past three months.Since he's a spirit reader, his spiritual force has been subtly making his body stronger. This is one reason why spirit readers grow so quickly. Also, Luo Feng is training in the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd and has been fighting on the border of life and death for the past two months.All three of these factors combined have made Luo Feng's rate of growth around five to six times faster than an above-average fighter.\"I'll go test for a bit in the Limit Hall tomorrow to see how strong I am\". Luo Feng wanted to see the results of his bitter training.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdDawn, around 5 AM. Luo Feng was headed towards the Limit Hall.\"Crazy, up so early?\". There were a few fighters doing their morning practice in the sector.\"Crazy, I heard you made a ton these past two months\"\"You better treat us to something. Treat us brothers in this sector to a cheerful, good meal\"Quite a few fighters laughed as they gave their greetings.Nobody knew much about Luo Feng's huge earning from the 'Hunter Silver Moon Wolf', but quite a few people in the circle of fighters recognized Luo Feng from the crazy slaughtering he did. Killing 10,000 soldier level monsters in two months is indeed a 'crazy' battle record.So getting the nickname 'Crazy' isn't so weird.Also, because of this, Luo Feng has gained much more respect from everyone. No matter how stupid someone is, killing 10,000 monsters will make you extremely experienced. Practice makes perfect.\"Alright, no problem, want to go tonight\" laughed Luo Feng.After entering the Limit Hall, a reception lady in the lobby saw Luo Feng and yelled: \"Mr. Luo, so early, there aren't even any people here yet. Would you like something to drink? I'll arrange for it\".\"Not right now, but prepare some tea and dessert. I'll eat it when I come down\" laughed Luo Feng, and then he directly went up stairs.Limit Hall's sixth floor.Luo Feng was extremely thankful as he looked at the gigantic training hall on the 6th floor. This was where he went through the prospective fighter exam. Who knew that, in a blink of an eye, that prospective fighter from before is now a true elite fighter. Luo Feng turned on the fist strength machine and the speed testing machine.After turning on the speed tester, Luo Feng stood on the track.\"Let's see my power\". Luo Feng, who was relaxed, instantly shot out with a \"HU\" sound like an arrow leaving its bow. In a blink of an eye, he rushed through the track and started slowing down.Luo Feng looked at the speed tester, and the display showed--\"78.6 m/s\"\"Not bad\" Luo Feng's eyes flashed.Normally, 60 m/s is what you would need for your body fitness level to reach an advanced level warrior. And 90 m/s is what you need to reach a beginner level warlord.\"Let me test my strength\" Luo Feng walked in front of the fist strength testing machine, took in a deep breath, and let his force explode!BOOM!The fist smacked into the tester like a cannon ball and ferociously shook the whole thing, the display showed--'6,121 kg'\ufffd\ufffdUsually, 4,000 kg counts as an advanced level warrior. And 8,000 kg counts as a beginner level warlord. Of course, this is just a number that estimates your strength. Your true skill is determined not only by your body fitness level, but also by your record of slayed monsters.Body fitness is just a portion of your strength.\"Now let's test the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd's force exertion\". Luo Feng took in a deep breath and then suddenly opened his eyes. He exerted force through his feet, which caused the entire floor of the training hall to shake a bit. The powerful force instantly carried from his feet to his waist. KAKAKA~~ each section of Luo Feng's spine held up, and the powerful force carried to his right arm.At the same time, his waist and back let out two connected force exertions like the rippling on the surface of a puddle.Connect!Second stage of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, 210% power, explode!As Luo Feng's fist moved, it continuously accelerated. It brought along an explosive shock wave, as it directly smacked into the machine.\"BOOM~~\" the target fell down and then slowly straightened itself again.The display also paused for a bit before showing the number--\"12,928 kg\"\ufffd\ufffd\"Alright!\" Luo Feng let out a smile on his face. 6121 times 2.1 is 12,854. However, fist strength is just an estimate, so it can be a bit higher or lower. In other words, Luo Feng's full power nears 13,000 kg of force.His actual body fitness level is an advanced level warrior's.However, with the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, he reaches the beginner level warlord. And he is way past the required 8,000 kg. A beginner level warlord's fist strength is usually between 8,000 kg and 16,000 kg.\"Finally, let's test my reaction speed\"Luo Feng entered the reaction speed testing room and switched it to the 'beginner level warlord' mode and set it to begin 'in 5 seconds'. After pressing the red button, Luo Feng swiftly ran into the circle.Inside the circle.After around 5 seconds, \"BEEP~~BEEP~~\" the cannon of the reaction speed tester machine started rotating faster and faster until it reached an astonishing speed. After that, little rubber bullets shot out of the dozens of muzzles in the main cannon, which flew towards the red circle.\"So fast\" Luo Feng stood in the middle of the red circle and started moving swiftly.His steps were light, yet quick.And very relaxed. If you could find someone who has the same reaction speed as Luo Feng, they probably wouldn't be as relaxed as him, because..... Luo Feng's technique has reached the 'Ru Wei class'. With the Ru Wei class' technique, Luo Feng is able to maximize his dodging ability.PU! PU! Two bullets hit Luo Feng, but Luo Feng didn't hesitate and kept dodging.One minute later, the cannon stopped rotating.Luo Feng then walked to the display and looked carefully: \"Hm? 60 seconds, 21 hits, 0 contacts with the red light, excellent?\" Luo Feng was amazed at this grade. He was actually able to receive a grade of excellent on a beginner level warlord's reaction speed test! You can clearly see the results of the Ru Wei class!Actually, this 'reaction speed testing machine' technically tests your dodging ability!And your dodging ability is dependent on your speed, reaction speed, awareness, etc. However, this is the best way of testing it.\"78.6 m/s\"\"Fist strength of 6,121 kg, I can make it near 13,000 kg at best\"\"Reaction speed test, beginner level warlord, excellent!\"Luo Feng was extremely satisfied with the results. He was clear that his body fitness level should make him an advanced level warrior, but with help from the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd and Ru Wei class, he's able to make his attack power and reaction speed reach a beginner level warlord.After testing, Luo Feng went downstairs cheerfully. In the lobby on the first floor, quite a few fighters were sitting and chatting.\"Crazy\"\"Luo Feng\" Chief instructor Wu Tong was also there and laughed as he said, \"Did you come this early to watch the prospective fighter exam? You didn't watch the past few times. Well, this time is good too, come and see how these rookies test. Maybe you can test them when the time comes?\".Luo Feng froze.Prospective fighter exam?Yes, today is 12/1. Every first day of the month is the day of the prospective fighter exam.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 67": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Feng couldn't help but to laugh. This world is indeed quite interesting. 5 months ago he was a member of the dojo that came here to test. At that time, his family still lived in a cheap home. In a blink of an eye, he's now living in the Ming-yue sector and is easily making millions!\"You should still do the testing, uncle Wu. At that time, I'll drop by and take a look\" laughed Luo Feng as he sat on the side. A waiter immediately brought tea and desserts.\"Crazy\" a dojo uniform wearing man, who was also an instructor at the Dojo of Limits, laughed as he said, \"I heard that you killed over 10,000 monsters in the past two months? And that they were mostly high level soldier level monsters? Then have you reached the 'beginner level warlord' level?\"\"Seems so\" nodded the person beside in agreement.Wu Tong also nodded: \"There's no way that an advanced level warrior could kill all these monsters so easily. Even if Luo Feng hasn't reached the beginner level warlord level, he's basically at that level. I remember that Luo Feng is training in the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd, so it seems that the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd has shown its effect\".Luo Feng froze.Isn't that why?He killed over 10,000 monsters in a bit less than two months, and most of them were definitely high level soldiers. Indeed, it would be really difficult for an advanced level warrior to have such efficiency. No wonder they all think that he has reached the 'beginner level warlord' level.\"The \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd is extremely hard to train in, and the price for that instruction manual is extremely expensive\" said the other fighters.\"Yea, it is very hard\" laughed Luo Feng as he nodded, \"I just coincidentally had some small breakthroughs\".\"Oh\"Everyone there, including Wu Tong, noticed that Luo Feng had a different look in his eyes. The \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd is an ultimate instruction manual. Quite a bit of people have bought this instruction manual, but quite a bit of fighters have also failed to just enter the first stage. Training in this instruction manual means that...... you'll be able to dominate your battles!\"Luo Feng\" a sound carried from outside. Luo Feng turned his head and saw brother Chen.\"Luo Feng, I heard you came back but I didn't think you would be here so early\" laughed Chen Gu as he walked over, \"Oh yea, are you planning to go to senior Lu Gang's memorial meeting tomorrow?\".\"It's such a big case, so we're all going. Luo Feng, you come too when the time comes\" said chief instructor Wu Tong.Luo Feng sighed with emotion, and then nodded.Of course he has to go to such an event.Their senior, Lu Gang, who passed away in the grade 3 rat tide was a powerful wargod! Even though Luo Feng didn't personally experience a rat tide, he was in the wilderness when the rat tide exploded..... He couldn't help but to feel sorry for the dead. Seeing how his senior has passed away, naturally Luo Feng will go and pay his respects.On the day of the prospective fighter exam, Luo Feng and the others watched the tender juniors' test. There were a total of 8 people, and 3 of them passed.There was actually someone Luo Feng was familiar with out of these 8 people. An elite member of the Zhi-An region's Dojo of Limits. However, this elite member didn't pass.Day 2, dawn. The temperature was low. In the funeral parlor of Jiang-Nan city's 'Heroes' Hall', security was extremely tight since many people were coming to pay their respects to their senior, Lu Gang.The five members of the fire hammer squad were all gathered together, and all five of them wore black.\"There are quite a few people here today\" said Chen Gu as he took in a breath. Luo Feng looked around, and just the surrounding streets were all filled with people who have come to pay their respects. Most importantly--Today is the first day of mourning, so only fighters, family members, high ranking government officials, etc. are allowed to come.And from tomorrow until the seventh day, the regular citizens are allowed to come in to pay their respects.Even so, there were over 10,000 people gathered here, and all of these people were upper class people in Jiang-Nan city. Some of them were at the top of large businesses, the government, and the army. There were also a huge mass of fighters. In the group of fighters, there were even powerful wargod level fighters!If a wargod dies, it is normal for the other wargods to come pay their respects.\"The national television came too\" said Luo Feng as he watched their vehicle.\"A wargod's memorial meeting is broadcasted across the entire country\" said Gao Feng thankfully, \"Barely any wargods die across the entirety of China each year\".Only fighters that are ranked wargod or higher can get broadcasted across the entire country. Warrior and warlord level fighters will never be able to enjoy such great treatment. Also, only the top generals of the army receive this kind of treatment too.\"Look, it's the mayor of Jiang-Nan city. He's over there, the leader that frequently appears on television\".\"Hmhm, look over there, it's the head of the Xu family, one of the 12 families of the HR alliance\".After Luo Feng heard about the Xu family, he couldn't help but to look over. An old man who was a bit fat and had white hair all over his head, seemed to be around 80 or 90 years old. However, he naturally had an aura of high authority around him. Behind him were four of his subordinates.\"Over there is the powerful wargod level fighter Zhu Ge Shan. He's our chief instructor Zhu Ge Tao's brother\".Quite a few fighters were discussing.The people who came here today were indeed important people. Whether in the world of the government, the army, businesses, or fighters, all of them were at the top.\"The memorial is starting\" said Gao Feng as he looked ahead, \"However, we have to wait for a bit before we can enter\".\"Let's wait, we rarely get to see all of these people\" laughed Chen Gu.Luo Feng and the others stood by the street and waited in the back with a large amount of fighters. The VIPs ahead already started to enter.\"BEEP!\"A gloomy, dark saucer shaped fighter aircraft directly flew over from far away, and the army surrounding the heroes' hall didn't attempt to block it. And the powerful wargod fighters, the mayor of Jiang-Nan city, and all of the top officials in the army and government that entered the memorial all came out to greet.\"A big one has arrived\" Chen Gu's eyes flashed.\"Damn, what kind of person came?\" even Gao Feng was shocked.The people who were at the scene were already at the top of China's upper class society. For example, the wargod fighters were at the top of the fighters. The mayor of Jiang-Nan city is, without a doubt, a top official. There are only six headquarter cities in China, so he is much more important than a governor before the Grand Nirvana period.However, all of these people have come out to greet.\"Who is it?\" Luo Feng looked carefully. All the fighters, and even the reporters from the national television, stared closely. Nobody dared to make a sound.Complete silence.The saucer shaped fighter aircraft slowly descended, and its mechanical door opened.A thin man who had an aquiline nose and whose clothes were black came down the steps of the fighter aircraft. It didn't seem like he was in a good mood, and tears could be seen in his eyes. Just his presence caused the people in a 10 meter radius to feel like they were falling into darkness. He is the deity in that radius.\"Mr. Zhu\" a powerful wargod fighter spoke.The aquiline nosed man sighed and didn't say anything. The wargod fighters, the mayor of Jiang-Nan city, and all the top officials from Kyoto city and the army nodded and headed straight towards the heroes' hall.The other people followed behind him.Complete silence.Only until after these important people entered did discussions start to rise from outside.\"Who is that guy?\" Luo Feng was full of curiosity. This is, without a doubt, the type of man who was at the top of the top of China. Wargod fighters rarely greet even a country's leader. Usually, wargod fighters don't respect high ranking officials.\"No idea\" Chen Gu and the others shook their heads.Gao Feng's ears moved a bit and then he said quietly: \"Someone ahead said that the guy just now is named 'Zhu Xi'. I heard of the name Zhu Xi. Back then, he was an extremely famous wargod level fighter. However, I haven't heard of him since; he rarely showed himself. I read on the internet that this Zhu Xi has already surpassed the wargod level and is one of the peak existences\".\"An existence that surpasses the wargod level?\" Luo Feng and the others took in a deep breath.Holy.An existence like that can go head to head with an entire country! A whole country has to bow down to this kind of person. This is indeed one of the top existences of human society. No wonder all the top officials of the businesses, government, army, and even wargod fighters came to receive and greet him.You can say--Such a person is like a 'god' to humanity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGrief echoed throughout the entire Heroes' Hall. From the government officials to the generals of the army to the wargod level fighters, all of them paid their respects. Even the national television was carefully recording this scene as the reporter described what was happening in front of the camera. Soon, it was Luo Feng and the group's turn.As the crowd flowed, the five members of the fire hammer squad quickly entered the Heroes' Hall.There was just a gigantic photo at the memorial meeting.\"Just a photo, not even a body\" thought Luo Feng to himself with amazement. Indeed, once you die after facing the infinite rat tide, not even your bones will remain! Luo Feng and the others respectfully bowed three times while being surrounded by the sounds of grief. Silently kneeling beside them were the powerful wargod fighter's wife and daughter.Luo Feng and the others quickly left the area.The mood of the area outside the hall seemed to have relaxed a bit; it wasn't so oppressive like the mood in the hall.\"Senior Lu Gang was unfortunate\" sighed Gao Feng as he shook his head, \"He just happened to fall into the middle of a rat tide. And the leader of the infinite rat tide surely determined that senior Lu Gang was a top fighter of humanity, so it was willing to give up everything to kill him! And once the rat tide is willing to do so, there's no escaping it\".Luo Feng said in a small voice: \"From what I heard from the scenes captured by the satellites, a couple dozen skyscrapers fell and millions of rat monsters died in senior Lu Gang's struggle. One can imagine the scene\".Before, Luo Feng, Wan Dong, and the others were only being chased by a small rat tide containing around tens of thousands of rat monsters.And there wasn't even a single commander level rat monster in that small rat tide, or else how come the rat tide couldn't catch up to Wan Dong and the others' speed? Even such a small rat tide was able to give Luo Feng such pressure. When he thinks about a scene of being surrounded by billions of rat monsters, he couldn't help but to shudder! The fact that the wargod fighter was able to kill millions of rat tide monsters in such a short time showed that he was extremely powerful.\"If senior Lu Gang was a bit more careful from the start and tried to avoid the center of the rat tide, he wouldn't have died\" sighed Gao Feng.The cold outside the Heroes' Hall was heavy, and the streets were filled with those from the circle of fighters, the government, the army, and people from family corporations.\"Luo Feng\" a sound carried over.Luo Feng turned his head and saw Xu Xin in a black outfit not too far away. This outfit gave Xu Xin a small feeling of coldness.\"Xu Xin, you don't have class today?\" asked Luo Feng.\"Today is Saturday, so I came over with my family\" Xu Xin couldn't help but to laugh.Luo Feng paused, and then laughed at himself: \"Saturday, oh..... I can't even remember the day of the week once I stopped going to school\". After you become a fighter, the day of the week doesn't matter at all. When he was still going to school, he was crystal clear on the date.\"Now that classmate Luo Feng is a fighter, he's different from us other classmates\" said Xu Xin purposefully.Luo Feng and Xu Xin chatted like this on the side of the street.And Xu Gang, who was currently chatting with a middle-aged lady, caught a glimpse of Luo Feng and Xu Xin together. He couldn't help but to frown, and then apologized to the middle-aged lady beside him: \"Director Zhang, I have some things to attend to. We'll talk about this dividing case later\".The middle-aged lady smiled as she nodded her head.Xu Gang walked to a close spot and paid attention to Luo Feng and Xu Xin out of the corner of his eye. With Xu Gang's vision, he could clearly see Luo Feng and Xu Xin's expressions. Clearly, they were having an enjoyable time, which made Xu Gang's face even worse: \"Sister is a prideful person, so she usually doesn't like to talk to guys of the same age. How come with this Luo Feng.....\"Sister Xu Xin has already reached the required age for marriage, so Xu Gang was extremely attentive to her love life.No matter what..... he did not like Luo Feng.\"A fighter who'll die off who knows when, and he's still bothering my sister? The deeper they go, the more bitter hardship my sister will have to go through in the future!\" Xu Gang was enraged, \"This Luo Feng, I already told him tactfully last time. If he knows, then he should stay away from my sister! He fails to appreciate my kindness!\"Xu Gang was clearly mad, but what can he do even if he's mad?He won't foolishly charge in.\"Hm?\" Xu Gang's gaze unexpectedly landed on someone not too far away, and with a heartbeat, \"I'll let Luo Feng have some pain and know his place!\".As he thought that in his heart, Xu Gang headed towards the left.\"Master Xu\" a seemingly handsome youth whose head was shaved laughed as he gave his greetings.\"Guo Hai\" laughed Xu Gang, \"I didn't think I would see brother Guo Hai here. I thought you were still in the wilderness\".\"Senior Lu Gang's memorial meeting is a huge thing, how could I not come?\" the handsome youth looked towards the Heroes' Hall and shook his head as he sighed, \"Back then, I received some pointers from senior Lu Gang. Who could've known that such an awesome, powerful fighter like senior Lu Gang would.....\"Xu Gang felt like Guo Hai was actually sad, and he secretly shook his head: \"This Gao Hai isn't even that close to wargod Lu Gang. Isn't he putting up too much of a show\".As a merchant, he was unable to understand the feeling between the fighters.Fighters that walk on the border of life and death never forget their favors. Naturally, one would never forget a senior's advice for the rest of their lives.\"Guo Hai, my sister came here today too\" laughed Xu Gang.\"Xu Xin?\" Guo Hai's heart skipped a beat, \"Where?\"Xu Gang laughed bitterly, and then showed the direction with his eyes: \"Oh, over there, chatting with a young fighter\".Guo Hai saw Luo Feng and Xu Xin far away and slightly frowned, he said in a surprised tone: \"As far as I know, lady Xu Xin rarely talks to fighters, so I'm guessing that this young fighter has a special connection with her\". Even though he liked Xu Xin, Guo Hai didn't believe that Xu Xin had to like him back.\"He does have a special connection\" Xu Gang shook his head, \"They used to be classmates, so my sister is on quite good terms with this kid. Or else she wouldn't be talking so much with him!\".Guo Hai nodded, indeed, Xu Xin rarely talked to young men.Even though he had quite a bit of self control, Guo Hai couldn't help but to feel a bit jealous.\"This kid, I warned him before to stay away from my sister. However, it looks like he has some plans of his own for my sister\" Xu Gang looked at Guo Hai, \"This kid doesn't even look at his own position. A warrior level fighter, who knows when he'll die. And he still dares to chase after my sister! A commoner chasing after royalty!\".Guo Hai frowned, but couldn't help but to feel a bit proud inside.Young people can't help but to compare themselves to others. As of now, he's already an intermediate level warlord! And he's only 21 years old.\"Xu Gang, you're right. a warrior level fighter will have a hard time in the wilderness, who knows what he'll die to\" nodded Guo Hai, \"If that kid really cares about Xu Xin, he shouldn't her\".\"I think so too!\" followed Xu Gang.Guo Hai looked at Luo Feng, and asked: \"Oh yea, what's his name?\".\"He's named Luo Feng, and just became a fighter not too long ago\" said Xu Gang.\"Luo Feng?\" Guo Hai frowned, \"Crazy?\".Xu Gang froze and looked at Guo Hai suspiciously: \"What Crazy?\".\"Crazy is a nickname. Only someone who has skill would receive a nickname from others. Usually, people don't even get nicknames even when they want them\" Guo Hai looked towards Xu Gang and frowned as he said, \"This Luo Feng has a bit of fame in the circle of fighters. You underestimate him. Even though he just became a fighter not too long ago, he killed over 10,000 soldier level monsters in just two short months. And I heard that they were mostly advanced level soldiers. I estimate that--he has the skill of a beginner level warlord!\".\"Killed over 10,000 monsters? Two months?\" Xu Gang blinked twice.\"And, you said he's a beginner warlord level? A 18 year old beginner warlord level fighter?\" Xu Gang couldn't help but to exclaim.Guo Hai nodded.Xu Gang widened his eyes as he turned around to look at Luo Feng, who was currently joyfully chatting with Xu Xin, and couldn't help but to curse: \"****, this kid pretended to be weak and tricked me! Who knew he was such a person!\". A 18 year old beginner warlord compared to a 21 year old intermediate warlord. As for potential, Luo Feng's is slightly higher.Xu Gang's attitude changed a bit.\"Who knew that this Crazy also liked Xu Xin\" Guo Hai let out a smile, \"Interesting, interesting!\".\"Luo Feng, is actually called Crazy..... this nickname\".Xu Gang was amazed beyond belief, \"However, killing around 10,000 monsters in two months! This is indeed quite crazy!\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe was completely shocked, but Xu Gang quickly regained his composure. As he examined Luo Feng from far away, the merchant quickly came to a conclusion, \"This Luo Feng is still young, but he's already a beginner level warlord! And the conditions he had back home weren't good at all, so being able to come to this stage is indeed quite rare! I'll look at it this way..... if he's able to become a wargod level existence some day, then I'm afraid that my dad and the others will have no choice but to let sister marry him\".\"However.....\"\"A fighter is ultimately a fighter. Even Lu Gang can die, so who knows when he'll die. Whatever, whatever, I won't think any further. I'll just see how Luo Feng will grow from here\" thought Xu Gang to himself. Indeed, a warlord level fighter is really nothing to a big family like the Xu family.The memorial meeting was still ongoing, but some fighters were already starting to leave.After the five members of the fire hammer squad left, they immediately started searching for a nice looking hotel with a classical style. The owner of this restaurant knew that there were quite a bit of people attending the memorial meeting today, since the memorial meeting was broadcasted across the country. Once he saw the direction Luo Feng and the others came from, along with the fighter-only car beside them, the owner of the restaurant immediately understood who these five were and led them to the best room on the third floor.\"Alright, go now\" Chen Gu quickly ordered some dishes and waved his hand signalling the waiter to leave.The most beautiful female waiter of the restaurant snuck a peek at them and then obediently left the room.\"****, I was in a pretty good mood today until I saw the bastards of the tiger fang squad. Just seeing them completely destroyed my great mood!\" Gao Feng couldn't help but to say out of anger while clenching his teeth. Before they left, Luo Feng and the others met the tiger fang squad, who also came to pay their respects.\"Captain, there's no need to get so angry over those bastards, it's not worth it\" Wei Tie shook his head.\"After we enter the wilderness, we'll find a chance to get rid of them\" laughed Wei Qing coldly.Luo Feng frowned and scanned the entire room with his spiritual force to make sure there weren't any hidden listening devices.After seeing Luo Feng like that, Gao Feng laughed as he said: \"Luo Feng, no worries! This restaurant counts as a high class one, so people who eat in rooms like these are usually quite important people. Classified information frequently goes around here. If the owner of this restaurant dares to eavesdrop, he's looking for death!\".Chen Gu also spoke: \"Who cares if someone is eavesdropping. We just talked about killing people, but we didn't kill anyone yet. We can't even talk about it with our mouths?\".Luo Feng laughed in agreement.\"Captain, are there any annoying figures behind the tiger fang squad*?\" asked Luo Feng, \"If there are, then we have to be cautious\".*TL note: No matter where I looked, it said \"fire hammer squad\", but considering the context, I'm pretty sure it's the tiger fang squad (it could just be a typo, but this is the first time I've ever seen a typo like this on all the sources I checked).\"Who could there be?\"Gao Feng sneered, \"It's not like their parents are wargods\".\"Oh yea, senior wargod Lu Gang has three children, two sons and one daughter. And the oldest son and daughter are warlord level experts. Only the second son's strength is average\" sighed Wei Tie, \"These experts are just not the same. Even the daughter is so powerful already\".\"Oh, three children and two of them are warlord level?\" Luo Feng was shocked.\"That's quite normal\".Gao Feng said, \"Luo Feng, you haven't been in the circle of fighters for a long time, so you probably aren't too sure. Actually, a powerful fighter's children will also be quite powerful! For example, the world's strongest fighter, 'Hong', is an existence that surpasses a wargod. And his sons and daughters are all wargod level!\".Luo Feng blinked twice, he really didn't know about this.\"It's quite simple actually\" laughed Gao Feng as he continued, \"When a fighter trains, every cell in his body absorbs genetic energy, perfecting the genes in his body. The genes of his body continuously get better! And in that process, the stronger the fighter, the higher quality his genes will become\".\"And when he marries and has kids, those genes are passed onto the next generation!\".\"It's not weird for children of the exceptionally powerful fighters like 'Hong', 'Thunder God', and 'Zhu Xi' to reach the wargod level! Because their genes are already great. However, this doesn't carry completely. If they aren't as powerful as their parents, it'll lead to each generation getting weaker and weaker. Eventually, the genes of that family will become average again\".Luo Feng nodded.Genes are indeed passed when having children. The children of powerful fighters have an advantage right at birth!The door opened, and the waiter came in with the food.\"Okay\"After the waiter put everything on the table and left, Gao Feng sighed as he said: \"Actually, if humanity keeps on going like this, the genes of the powerful fighters will spread around, therefore increasing the quality of all the genes of humanity! However, when a weak person marries a powerful person, their children could be quite normal\".\"So, it's very hard to raise the quality of the genes of humanity as a whole\".\"Powerful people raise the quality of humanity's genes, while weak people lower them\".\"However, one point is clear. As time passes, the genes of humanity as a whole will continuously rise in quality! One day, almost all of humanity can become fighters!\".Luo Feng slightly nodded at Gao Feng's conclusion.\"Of course, for every single human to become a fighter... who knows how long that'll take! 500 years? 1,000 years? 50,000 years?\" laughed Gao Feng as he shook his head. Evolution for all of humanity is indeed a slow process.Luo Feng and the others quickly finished lunch and, after the dishes were taken away, ordered some tea.\"Old Chen and Wei Tie and his brother have pretty much gotten used to their strength. Let me see, we'll go into the wilderness these two days\" said Gao Feng as he looked at the others, \"Anyone have any opinions?\".\"How about, the day after tomorrow?\" spoke Chen Gu.Luo Feng nodded: \"Let's depart on the day after tomorrow. However, captain, where are we going to this time?\".\"Haha\" Chen Gu laughed, \"This time we surely won't be going to those small country level cities. Our squad is much more powerful than it was before\". Saying that the squad as a whole has increased in strength by at least 10 times is no exaggeration.\"Let's go to a major city area\" Wei Tie and Wei Qing's eyes flashed.In the past, they were only willing to fight a bit in prefecture-level cities.\"How about--we get arrogant and try the #003 city?\" said Gao Feng quietly as he took in a deep breath.\"#003 city?\".Luo Feng and the others were completely shocked.#003 city, what does that represent?You could say it's one of the most horrifying areas in all of Eurasia. This place is near the sea, so there are large amounts of ocean monsters. This city also has one of the highest building densities, so the amount of monsters here has reached an alarming amount. There are many horde leader level monsters, and even monsters that surpass the horde leader level live here!Large amounts of top fighters come here!Fighters from other headquarter cities in Asia also come to this area just for this city!Here, is where human fighters and soldiers slaughter each other!Here, is where the center of China's economy was before the Grand Nirvana Period--Shanghai city!\"There?\" Wei Tie and Wei Qing were both shocked.\"That's too much, the difficulty gap is too great\" Wei Tie couldn't help but to say, \"How about we go to #023 city in old Suzhou first?\" No matter how arrogant, anyone would tremble in fear after hearing the name of #003 city. This place is where the real dragons, snakes, and alligators appear!Gao Feng looked at the others and laughed: \"Scared?\".\"Who's scared, whoever goes to #003 city will get major bragging rights\" Chen Gu's eyes flashed, \"Go, of course we're going! #003 city is a gigantic city anyway, probably more than 10 times larger than the other cities. We're just creeping along the border, what is there to be afraid of\".\"Luo Feng, what about you?\" the group looked towards Luo Feng, since he was the top fighting force of the squad!Luo Feng contemplated. Of course Luo Feng knew about the legendary #003 city.What #003 city means to humans today versus what Shanghai meant before the Grand Nirvana period, they are both special!\"Okay, we can go. But we have to go slowly from the suburbs\" nodded Luo Feng.\"Of course we're going slowly from the suburbs, or am I tired of living? I don't want to die yet\" laughed Gao Feng, \"Some of my old friends are all drifting around #003 city. That is where all the top fighters appear. Hmph hmph..... of course we're gonna have to start going there too\".Being able to survive in #003 city is a symbol of strength!Because there are large amounts of alligators there. There are large amounts of commander level monsters even in the suburbs. And along the riverbanks are quite a few horde leader level monsters! So those without strength wouldn't dare go to #003 city.\"Alright, then everyone get some rest. We'll depart tomorrow towards #003 city\" laughed Gao Feng.\"Alright, to #003 city!\".The blood of Luo Feng and the others were boiling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the third day, Luo Feng and Chen Gu left the Ming-Yue sector and grouped up with Gao Feng, Wei Tie, and Wei Qing at the HR alliance market to head towards the resupplying base in the southeast.The military sector in the southeast was way larger than Jiang-Nan city's northern military sector!\"This resupplying base is also way larger than the resupplying base in the northern military's sector\". After getting the key, Luo Feng and the group couldn't help but to take in a breath as they walked inside the resupplying base. The amount of villas in this resupplying base way surpassed the northern sector's amount. And with a glance, you could see large amounts of fighters in every area.In terms of strength, the fighters here have way surpassed the fighters of the northern sector.\"Of course they're way stronger!\" exclaimed Gao Feng, \"#003 city is near the sea. The uncountable amount of monsters in the sea have split the continent and threaten the mainland along the Huang Pu river. This resupplying base exists to deal with those sea monsters. And the fighters are mainly here to deal with the monsters inside the #003 city.Compared to the monsters of the land, the monsters of the sea pose a much larger threat to humanity.Because..... the area of the sea way surpasses the area of the land, and the entire sea is the monster's territory. One could imagine just how many monsters are in the sea.\"Look, that's a 'poison devil gun', isn't it?\".\"Hmhm, holy shit, isn't that a wargod? Wargod level fighters rarely appear in the northern military sector, but we just got here and we already saw one\".\"Not surprising, #003 city is one of the few large camps for the monsters in all of Eurasia. Professionals from other headquarter cities come here too, not just from our Jiang-Nan city. So it's not weird for so many strong people to be here\".The fire hammer squad looked down from the rooftop of their apartment and were all surprised.The fighters here truly came from all parts of the world!\"We'll eat, and after lunch we'll head to #003 city\" said Gao Feng.Moments later, the five fully equipped members of the fire hammer squad left the resupplying base.\"It's the fire hammer squad, they came here too?\"\"I heard that the rookie, Crazy, who just joined the fire hammer squad is quite strong. He's an beginner warlord, so he's sure to improve rapidly\".The people inside the resupplying base laughed as they discussed.\"Crazy?\" Wan Dong, who was chatting with his friends in the shade of a tree, couldn't help but to turn his head. At this time, the five members of the fire hammer squad were headed towards the gate of the base.\"Dong, this Luo Feng is in the same batch as you right\" spoke the burly brute beside him.\"Yeah\"Wan Dong nodded, \"We became fighters in the same group. During the grade three rat tide explosion from last time, I even met him. I wouldn't have thought that he would come to the military sector in the southeast\". The captain of Wan Dong's original squad died in the rat tide from last time, so Wan Dong and the others joined another fighter squad and came here.\"Dong, keep at it, don't lose to this Luo Feng\" the burly brute smacked Wan Dong's chest.Wan Dong watched Luo Feng's shadow disappear at the gate while having complicated feelings.When they participated in the prospective fighter exam together, they were both scouted by dojos! Who knew that in a blink of an eye, Luo Feng has already made his name in the circle of fighters while he's still a rookie that needs to work hard. If you mention 'Crazy of Jiang-Nan city', most people would know what you're talking about.Know that, making a name for yourself is an extremely difficult thing to do!Or, rely on a earth shattering battle!Or, rely on a special battle record! Like Luo Feng killing 10,000 monsters in two months.Or, rely on the build up of your fame over tiring months and long years! For example, Chen Gu and Zhang Ke spent a dozen years building up their fame before they were known!And now, Luo Feng counts as someone with quite a bit of fame.\"He was like me back then, and now he's already someone who has a bit of fame in the circle of fighters. I can't lose to him!\" Wan Dong clenched his fists. With his target Luo Feng right in front of him, Wan Dong didn't dare to relax.Along the highway, Luo Feng and the others walked for around 2 days until they finally reached the outskirts of #003 city.The sky was gray and the fire hammer squad treaded forwards carefully, \"Into the house!\" yelled Gao Feng.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Luo Feng and the others swiftly entered a shop on the street.\"Bleating~~\"\"Quack quack~~\"Only after the few hundred birds that covered the sky flew past did the fire hammer squad carefully come out.\"This is where the monsters gather. It's their biggest camp in all of Eurasia. Not just land monsters, but all sorts of flying monsters are here too\" warned Gao Feng in a small voice, \"And since it's near the sea, amphibious monsters appear too. So everyone, make sure to be careful, careful, and even more careful!\".\"Understood, captain\" Luo Feng and the others nodded.Everyone knew how dangerous it was here. When the group of flying monsters from before attacked, they were only able to keep their lives because of the terrain and Luo Feng's explosion.\"Our target is a small sector 2 miles away called 'Wan-Ke Dream City'\" said Gao Feng in a small voice, \"This Wan-Ke dream city takes up an immense amount of land, large enough for a million people to live there. Right now, there are quite a bit of monsters there. Since it's on the outskirts of #003 city, horde leader level monsters are rare. It's suitable for us to wander around there for a bit\".\"Okay\" the others nodded.\"Everybody be careful. Whether the sky, the ground, or even underground, monsters can appear from anywhere\" Gao Feng waved his hand, \"Depart!\".Luo Feng's ghost blade was already unsheathed, and Chen Gu's RG112 heavy machine gun was ready to fire at any time. The five members of the fire hammer squad carefully moved forward and didn't dare to let down their guard for even a moment. They were completely different from the time they were in the small country level city.\"HOWL~~\" \"GROWL~~\" \"DIE!\"An earth shaking growl rumbled over from a few dozen miles away, and even some human's enraged howls.\"****, what monster?\" Chen Gu couldn't help but to turn his head towards the origin of the sound.\"That's towards the city sector, where real ichthyosauruses and alligators appear. There are quite a bit of horde leader level monsters and wargod level fighters there\" said Gao Feng in a small voice, \"If you don't have the power of a wargod, going there is suicide! In #003 city, powerful fighters from not just China, but also Russia and India are there!\".Luo Feng and the others nodded.For a short two miles, not even a minute is needed if they explosively sprint. However, the fire hammer squad spent half an hour to reach the Wan-Ke dream city sector that was abandoned dozens of years ago. In this half an hour, Luo Feng and the others killed two snake type monsters, 30 regular soldier level monsters, and a low level commander!\"I heard it was dangerous, but I didn't think it would be this dangerous! We were so careful and yet we were still forced to fight a low level commander\" Chen Gu's eyes flashed, \"Just what you'd expect from #003 city\".\"Go, hurry upstairs!\"Gao Feng waved his hand.Luo Feng and the others carefully and swiftly entered an apartment building. This building had 18 floors, and from the 1st floor to the 12th floor, Luo Feng and the others met around 10 monsters.On the 12th floor was a room around 100 square meters.\"While we're here at #003 city, this house will be our temporary resting spot\" spoke Gao Feng.Luo Feng also nodded.Unlike other cities, #003 city has large amounts of flying type monsters, so you can't rest on the rooftop. If you rest on the roof, you're looking for death.\"Look, there!\" Gao Feng stood on the dusty balcony and pointed towards the south, \"Look there, at the place that's completely covered in mist\".Luo Feng and the others walked there.Indeed, around 10 miles away, a few buildings could barely be seen in the mist; it was impossible to see any further than the broken sign there. That location was strangely covered entirely by the mist. #003 city is actually mostly covered in dust. All sorts of monsters' howls and birds' cries could be heard. And the rumbling of the tens of thousands of monsters was uncountable!\"That's the core of this sector. It used to be a Knorr convenience store, but now there's a \"high level horde leader\" monsters residing there\" said Gao Feng sternly, \"No matter, no matter what, we won't approach that area! I heard that the high level horde leader there has two low level horde leaders, large amounts of commanders, and uncountable amounts of soldier monsters there. It's the tyrant of a 20 to 30 mile radius!\"Luo Feng took in a deep breath.A high level horde leader and two low level horde leaders? What kind of group is this?\"Of course, they can only be a tyrant in the outskirts like this. In the city, horde leader level monsters are everywhere\" Gao Feng waved his hand, \"Alright, we'll rest for the night. Tomorrow, we'll start our journey in the #003 city\".\"Yes, captain\".Luo Feng and the others exchanged glances and let out smiles.\"Bleating~~\"The couple hundred bird monsters flew past from above the small sector, and some of them even flew past the apartment buildings. The closest monster was just 20 to 30 meters away from Luo Feng and the others.\"Everyone enter the rooms and rest. The windows of the rooms aren't big, so the flying monsters can't fly in here. Today, Chen Gu and Wei Tie, you two rotate and keep watch for the night\".In #003 city, even if Luo Feng and the others want to sleep, they have to let someone keep watch!Nobody dared to relax, for this was an amusement park to the monsters, a den to the humans, and a battlefield to the fighters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the night, dawn.Luo Feng stood on the balcony of the 12th floor. The winter chill of the morning touched his face, startling Luo Feng's spirit.\"It's around 5 or 6 degrees below 0 today\" laughed Gao Feng.\"It is a bit cold\".Luo Feng looked down from the balcony and saw a monster hunting for prey, \"But right in the morning, there are already quite a bit of monsters in the area! Look, there are around 12 monsters in my field of vision, and three of them are commander level! Hmhm, #003 city is indeed the camp of the monsters\".Gao Feng laughed.Indeed, in a regular city, a commander usually leads around a few hundred regular monsters; they have lots of authority! And in the city that Luo Feng stayed in to train his blade technique, a commander level monster had around a few hundred to even a few thousand monsters under its control!In a city, the fewer the commanders, the more monsters each one can lead!But in #003 city, even in the outskirts, a commander level monster only has around two to three soldiers with it. Sometimes they have none, becoming a leader without any followers.\"These are all weaker commanders, they don't have many followers! As for the stronger commanders and even horde leaders, they'll have tens of thousands of followers!\" Gao Feng turned his head to look at the others, \"Everyone, wake up, let's go hunt the monsters below!\".\"Let's go brothers, let's earn some money\" Chen Gu couldn't help but to laugh as he said.\"This #003 city is full of opportunity! Commanders are everywhere!\" the eyes of Wei Qing and Wei Tie flashed.#003 city is dangerous!But chances exist together with danger. There are many powerful monsters here, and if you don't have enough skill, you'll easily die. Even if you're powerful, once you get surrounded by a horde, you're also finished..... however! The commanders here don't have many followers, so it's much easier to hunt these commanders!Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Luo Feng was in front of the staircase, and after using his spiritual force to scan the corners, waved his hand: \"No problem, no monsters in a 20 meter radius\".Monsters usually lie in ambush from the corners! And Luo Feng's spiritual force is the best detector.\"Being with a spirit reader is fantastic\" smiled Chen Gu.\"Everyone watch yourselves, don't make a sound. Monsters ears' are very sensitive\" Gao Feng glared at Chen Gu, and Chen Gu immediately shut up.Luo Feng was leading while Gao Feng was in the back.Wei Tie and Wei Qing were on the two sides, and Chen Gu was in the middle!\"Hm?\" Luo Feng's gaze landed on a three horned boars around 100 meters away. One of the horned boars was extremely large and its horn was black. Unlike the usual gray fur, its needle-like fur was black. All of this pointed to its identity--Low level commander!\"It's that\"Luo Feng said quietly, \"I'll take care of that horned boar ahead. Everyone watch the surroundings\".Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Luo Feng charged ahead while the four in the back naturally spread out according to the formation. They were watching for other commander monsters, or if there were other human fighters trying to interfere.\"HOWL~~\" the commander level horned boar saw the human Luo Feng rushing alone and immediately howled. Its speed shot to 100 m/s, which is around 360 km/h. And that horned boar was charging straight at Luo Feng! With its body size, the force of impact would be enough to even smash open a truck.Luo Feng held his ghost blade and kept his regular speed of around 60 to 70 m/s.The two met!Luo Feng's speed instantly rose, and with a step, he accurately dodged to the centimeter. Meanwhile, Luo Feng's blade was drawing up! As the blade went, it increased in speed twice, making the blade blurry! It became a blinding light!The cold light of the blade was like a thunderbolt, and it drew across the neck of the horned boar. The light of the blade was like a mist from a dream, and instantly dispersed!Blade technique--Thunderbolt! First success!PUCHI! PUCHI!The two seemingly simple slashes from Luo Feng's ghost blade instantly slashed across the necks of the other two soldier level horned boars.\"RUMBLE~~\" the commander level horned boar who lost its life continued to sprint for around 10 more meters before falling to the ground with a rumble. It slid on the ground for a few dozen meters before smashing into a large, tough tree that has been growing on the side for dozens of years, causing the entire tree to shake a bit before stopping.\"Hmhm, nice job, destroying a commander level monster with just blade technique alone\" Chen Gu and the others huddled around.\"You've improved quite a bit\" Gao Feng was also happy, and he was already heading over to dissect the corpse of the monster.\"My technique, along with my blade technique and bountiful experience, made killing a low level commander so easy\" Luo Feng was amazed inside. Since he killed over 10,000 monsters, Luo Feng was able to remain perfectly calm when dealing with these monsters, enabling him to use his blade technique and technique to their maximum.Using the smallest amount of strength to instantly get rid of the opponent!\"Alright, dissection complete\" Gao Feng let out a smile, \"Let's see, we can hunt quite a bit of commander level monsters today\".\"Go, to the next one\" Luo Feng also let out a smile.Everyone in the fire hammer squad were in high spirits.In #003 city, even though they knew that they were going to be able to hunt many monsters, once they actually started fighting, Luo Feng realized..... Holy shit. They weren't killing monsters. They were basically printing money! Even a money printer wouldn't be able to make as much money as Luo Feng and the others were making right now!The materials of a low level commander are worth around 5 million ~ 15 million.The materials of a medium level commander are worth around 10 million ~ 100 million.The materials of a high level commander are worth around 50 million ~ 600 to 700 million.Of course, there are some exceptions, like some extremely rare monster, or some high level commander that's approaching the horde leader level. Naturally, the prices for their materials will be higher. But most of the monsters fit the price range above.The fire hammer squad killed around 10 commanders a day! Of course, most of them were low level commanders! The amount of money they made was simply shocking!After fighting for 10 days, Luo Feng and the others killed 92 low level commanders and 3 medium level commanders. The estimated price for them is probably a billion! Since they fought hard for 10 days, Luo Feng and the others were quite tired, so they took a good day to rest. After that, they kept hunting monsters and oh..... it's just that the monsters in the area have clearly decreased by a significant amount.The 15th day.On the 12th floor of the 18 story apartment building, Luo Feng and the others were resting.\"Captain, we rarely see any low level commanders near this area anymore\" said Chen Gu hopelessly.\"It can't be helped. We've been killing quite cruelly recently\" laughed Gao Feng, \"But no need to rush, monsters come in groups..... According to my estimations, the amount of monsters here will start increasing within 10 days! All we have to do is quietly defend here, since we're familiar with the area\".Luo Feng also nodded.Even though this area was big, Luo Feng and the others memorized it completely these past few days.\"Looks like #003 city is still the best for making money\" Wei Tie couldn't help but to be amazed.Even though Luo Feng and Gao Feng mainly did all the work, Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and Chen Gu still benefit greatly. After dividing the money, each of them will get over 100 million! Before, in the small cities, commanders were rare. Wei Qing and Wei Tie probably couldn't earn 100 million in a year. But now they passed that amount in just 15 days.Of course--The bigger the gain, the bigger the risks! In these past few days, Luo Feng and the others also encountered an assault from a flying monster. Thankfully, they hid in the house and relied on Luo Feng's throwing knives to scare them away.\"Tons of money? It's not a lot at all\" laughed Gao Feng, \"It's normal for a spirit reader to earn billions a year. The only reason we're able to stay here is mainly thanks to Luo Feng\".\"Haha\" Chen Gu, Wei Qing, and Wei Tie couldn't help but to start laughing.\"Captain, don't say that. It's because of your help that killing these monsters became that much easier\". Luo Feng was telling the truth when he said that. It's impossible for one person to pay attention to all of his surroundings. Some squads have three members responsible for keeping watch and to remove potential dangers.And only with the help of an 'intermediate warlord' like Gao Feng will Luo Feng's efficiency be high.Luo Feng and the others talked in a relaxed manner, but their voices weren't raised high.\"Hm?\" Chen Gu looked down through the laser aimer of his heavy sniper rifle and suddenly said, \"****, a big one's here!\".\"What?\" Luo Feng and the others basically immediately came over and looked through their binoculars.Luo Feng looked carefully.....In a apartment building faraway, the corners were filled with vines and moss. And in these vines was a gigantic snake that was 20 meters long and as thick as a person's waist. The snake's body had black stripes and the closer they got to its head, the thicker they became.The very end of the gigantic snake split into two triangular snake heads, and both of these heads had a bulge on their foreheads.\"****, is this the snake type monster, 'black striped', that has lethal poison?\" cursed Gao Feng under his voice, \"And this is even a mutated snake type monster, 'twin headed black striped snake'. And it's almost growing a horn and becoming a dragon\".Luo Feng also took in a deep breath.A mutated black striped snake that's almost a dragon?This thing shouldn't be messed with!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"A black striped snake that's about to become a dragon; it's surely a high level commander and nearing the horde leader level!\" Gao Feng's expression was extremely serious, and he said in a small voice, \"And since it's a mutated twin headed black striped snake, its venom is many times more powerful than a regular black striped snake! It also has two venom sacs, and each of those venom sacs are worth double the amount of a non-mutated black striped snake\".\"In other words--\"\"This twin headed black striped snake is worth the same amount as four black striped snakes of the same level! A black striped snake that's about to become a dragon is worth around 400 million, so this twin headed black striped snake is worth 1.6 billion! The price is comparable to a regular low level horde leader monster\" after Gao Feng said these numbers, the heart rate of the others started increasing rapidly...... they have killed hundreds of commander level monsters over the past few days.But all of that is not even close to the amount of money that the twin headed black striped snake is worth! Obviously, killing stronger monsters earns money at a higher rate.\"Of course, this twin headed black striped snake is extremely dangerous, once you get bit by it or get poisoned by it in any way, it's certain death!\" Gao Feng said lowly, \"And it has two brains, so both heads can attack the enemy together\".\"Are we doing this?\" Gao Feng looked towards the other members of the squad and finally laid his eyes on Luo Feng.Everyone was silent as they looked at Luo Feng.Luo Feng was the one to make the decision!A twin headed black striped snake would make them tons of money! But at the same time, it's extremely dangerous!\"I'm in!\"Luo Feng clenched his teeth, \"Captain, what about you?\". With his spiritual force, his dodging would be unpredictable!\"Luo Feng, help me a bit if there's trouble\" Gao Feng clenched his teeth, \"Fighters are supposed to walk on the border of life and death. Wei Tie, give me your shield\".\"Here, captain\".Wei Tie had no hesitation as he gave his shield to Gao Feng. And Gao Feng put one of his hammers on the ground. He had a shield in his left hand and a hammer in his right. He laughed at himself: \"After all this time, I still rarely use a shield in combat. However, this twin headed black striped snake is just too dangerous. If I don't use a shield, I'll actually be quite scared\".\"Captain, I'll attack from afar and you attack up close\" said Luo Feng quietly, \"If something happens, I'll use my spiritual force on your shield or hammer and you can use that force to dodge away\".\"Understood\" Gao Feng nodded.Luo Feng looked at the other three and said: \"I'll go down with the captain, you guys stay here. Oh yea, brother Chen, aim with your sniper rifle...... and make sure nobody tries to take advantage of us and steal the kill!\".\"No worries, I'll keep aiming below\" laughed Chen Gu slightly, \"If you want me to fire, just notify me directly\".\"Okay\"Through the tactical communications watch, members of a squad can keep in touch any time.\"Captain, let's go\". Luo Feng and Gao Feng speeded down the stairs. Against a monster of this level, Chen Gu and the others could do nothing to help.Luo Feng and Gao Feng reached the ground and, using their memory, went along a ruined, stony path towards the location of the twin headed black striped snake.\"BOOM!\"\"HISS~\" the ear piercing hiss of the snake carried over from far away.Luo Feng and Gao Feng exchanged glances, and the tactical communications watch slightly vibrated at the same time. Luo Feng lowered his head to look, and a line of words appeared on the tactical communications watch--\"three people suddenly appeared and are currently in an intense battle with the twin headed black striped snake\".Gao Feng also received the news and said quietly: \"Didn't think that some other group would get to it first. However, let's go take a look\".\"Let's go\" Luo Feng also nodded.The two of them rapidly got close and quickly arrived at the corner of a residential apartment. Past the corner, Luo Feng caught a glimpse of the three men currently fighting against the twin headed black striped snake around a few dozen meters away. The three men looked like they were from Western or Southern Asia. Their hair was slightly curly and their skin color was slightly dark.The bald man who seemed to be the leader of these three men held a dark, golden bo staff around three meters long.The staff in his hand was like a swimming dragon. Every time the triangular head of the twin headed black striped snake hissed as it flew over to him, the bo staff would always be quick enough to smash the snake. Even if it couldn't smash the head, it would still smash the body of the twin headed black striped snake. Sometimes, the 'point' on the head of the bo staff would connect, causing the twin headed black striped snake to hiss in rage!As for the other two, they both held a rectangular shield in one hand and a gigantic scimitar in the other. These two were close together and attacked as a team: their coordination was amazing.\"PENG!\"The rusty fitness machines that filled the sector from long ago were all smashed open by the swinging tail of the twin headed black striped snake, and the bald brute also retreated rapidly. The bo staff turned and formed a whirlwind that blocked all of the scrap metal, and the master of the staff retreated rapidly.\"Great bo staff technique\" Gao Feng couldn't help but to say quietly, \"This bald guy is probably an advanced level warlord. The other two are probably medium level warlords\".Luo Feng nodded.This brute dared to go head to head with the twin headed black striped snake, so it's easy to tell that he's strong.\"SI SI~~\"The twin headed black striped snake was enraged, and the cold eyes of the two gigantic snake heads were enough to send chills down your spine. It repeatedly widely opened its mouth as it attacked. Under the attack of the twin headed black striped snake, the three of them retreated rapidly and started to exchange words. After hearing the conversation between the three, Luo Feng and Gao Feng instantly determined--Indians!After the battle, one of the heads of the twin headed black striped snake was bleeding. It was smashed by the bo staff of the bald brute! However, this wound was clearly not fatal.WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!The three Indians swiftly headed towards the direction of Luo Feng and Gao Feng.\"Feel free to fight it if you can\" the bald brute squeezed out some chinese. At this time, the twin headed black snake was hissing as it charged over.Luo Feng and Gao Feng laughed coldly and didn't say much, and then swiftly dodged to the side. They weren't stupid enough to charge directly at a twin headed black striped snake. The leader of the three Indians, the bald brute, couldn't help but to curse under his voice and then shot his three meter long bo staff at the twin headed black striped snake.\"Now is the time\"Luo Feng already grabbed his black throwing knife as he dodged, and this was a 9th series throwing knife! He threw it with lightning speed!The throwing knife formed a cold light as it shot towards the left head of the twin headed black striped snake. As an existence that is almost a dragon, the twin headed black striped snake is extremely intelligent. It saw that the insignificant human threw a throwing knife, so its left head swiftly waved. The brain of a snake has always worked extremely quickly!The left head of the twin headed black striped snake instantly became blurred.\"Its intellect was used against itself\" laughed Luo Feng coldly, \"Change!\"He purposefully threw his throwing knife to make the wiseacre twin headed black striped snake to think he used hidden weapons. Using common sense, throwing knives can't change direction in the air. Sadly..... Luo Feng wasn't some hidden weapons expert, but was tens to hundreds of times stronger than a hidden weapons expert.When there was just barely a meter left between the throwing knife and the twin headed black striped snake, the knife slightly changed direction. Just this slight change caused the knife to charge towards one of the eyes of the twin headed black striped snake's left head.\"HISS~\" the twin headed black striped snake hissed out of rage, and in that short moment, actually made an dodging movement with its left head!Know that, Luo Feng's throwing knife was already going at a few times faster than the speed of sound, even faster than a sniper bullet!A distance of one meter and a speed several times the speed of sound, not even a thousandth of a second!And since the throwing knife was moving so quickly, even Luo Feng couldn't be sure that he changed it at 1 meter or 1.5 meters. Since the throwing knife was so fast, a slight delay means that the knife could've moved forward by 10 meters already. Even if he reacts quickly, in that short moment, Luo Feng can only change the knife's direction once!And in just that short moment, not only did the twin headed black striped snake react, but it also dodged! Of course, since it was such a short moment, the twin headed black striped snake dodged under extreme circumstances.\"PU!\" the throwing knife shot at the mouth of the twin headed black striped snake and drew out a gap, and grazed the twin headed black striped snake's scales.CHI CHI~~It only left a white mark, and the throwing knife directly reflected into the ground.\"Such horrifying defense\" Luo Feng was startled, \"Such amazing dodging capabilities. It changed direction in such a short distance, and this twin headed black striped snake was still able to dodge? This is going to be a problem!\" Luo Feng knew that getting rid of this twin headed black striped snake by himself would be extremely difficult.\"Hiss~\" the two heads of the twin headed black striped snake both turned towards Luo Feng. Its left head had a huge gap in its mouth, and a deep, green colored blood flowed out continuously.The bald brute who wielded the long bo staff laughed loudly, and as he retreated, he yelled in his awkward chinese, \"Team up, split half?\". His gaze was on Luo Feng.Luo Feng and Gao Feng exchanged glances.\"Alright\" said Luo Feng.\"OK!\" Gao Feng even purposefully made a gesture.The three Indians and Luo Feng and Gao Feng, both groups instantly made their decision to cooperate. The bald brute's strength earned Luo Feng and Gao Feng's recognition while Luo Feng's throwing knives earned the three Indian's recognition! Only with strength can you earn others' attention and respect!And outside of Wan-Ke dream city was a fighter squad of nine that was currently slowly heading forward. In this squad of nine were the members of the tiger fang squad.\"Hm? That's the sound of a snake, and an extremely powerful one at that\".Out of the nine, a veteran whose hair was white spoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn Wan-Ke dream city's ruined, barren land was a sound of rumbling.A snake as thick as a person's waist charged like lightning towards the two scimitar-wielding Indians. The two Indians leaped with a 'WHOOSH' five or six meters high and grabbed the window railing of an apartment building. The snake's tail then cruelly smashed into a tree on the side. From around five or six meters up the tree was a 'KACHA' sound as it directly split open and rumbled as it fell.\"Haha, trying to kill me?\" at this time, Luo Feng was sprinting quickly with a shield in one hand.The two heads of the twin headed black striped snake were crazily chasing after Luo Feng!Whoosh! Whoosh!He swung his arm and two throwing knives came out. It seemed like Luo Feng used his arm to throw them, but actually, the throwing knives were completely controlled by spiritual force right when they were thrown, causing the two throwing knives to accelerate to an amazing speed. An eye would barely be able to see two blurred, cold lights headed towards the twin headed black striped snake!\"HISS~~\" the twin headed black striped snake roared as it tried to dodge.\"Change!\" Luo Feng's gaze was cold.The two throwing knives slightly changed direction, but not by a large amount. Since the throwing knives were way faster than bullets fired from a sniper rifle, the others couldn't even tell that the throwing knives changed direction.\"PUCHI!\" \"CHI!\"One of the two throwing knives grazed the left head of the snake as it flew by, but the other throwing knife hit the left head. Ever since they started fighting, Luo Feng already let out six throwing knives, and all six of these throwing knives were attacking the snake's left head. At this time, the snake's left head was covered with fresh blood, and its wounds were shocking.\"Hu!\" Luo Feng's body was extremely light, and his sprinting speed was startling.The bo staff-wielding leader of the Indian group made an excited shout and chased the snake, as if it was a running dog, while it was chasing after Luo Feng. One hit after another, he fiercely shot his staff towards the twin headed black striped snake's right head. The twin headed black striped snake didn't dare to use its head to block the alloyed staff, so it could only dodge.Know that, even though this staff doesn't seem powerful and isn't sharp like a spear...Once it makes contact, all of its power will be focused on the tip. The area of the tip isn't large, so that small tip is like a blunt weapon!\"Come on Indian, keep at it!\" howled Gao Feng.The other two large scimitar and shield wielding Indian fighters, with Gao Feng, closely attacked the body of the twin headed black striped snake. First, doing this prevented the twin headed black striped snake from using its tail to attack Luo Feng and the Indian leader. Second, they also wanted to attack this giant snake at around 7 inches!The snake's weak point is at 7 inches. Of course 7 inches is an abstract number; the main point is to attack its vital organs.*TL note: Refer to the end for more information.Even though the snake was confident in its defense, it still didn't want to let Gao Feng and the other two aim for its vitals. So the snake retracted its tail and wrapped it..... as it tried to think of a way to deal with Gao Feng and the other two.\"Whoosh!\"The shield in Luo Feng's left hand was affected by spiritual force and, after Luo Feng exerted force in his foot, he intensely flew straight towards captain Gao Feng's position. When he was near Gao Feng, Luo Feng whispered: \"Captain, when you get near the snake to attack, use your hammer and smash right towards this snake's left head!\".\"Hehe, understood\" Gao Feng immediately understood what Luo Feng meant.Luo Feng's movements on the battlefield were strange and erratic. He never got close to the snake; he just relied on his amazing speed to hover around the battlefield.\"YA!\" The Indian leader suddenly shouted and his face reddened; the blood in his body was pumping to its limit. For a moment, his body looked like a legendary buddhist arhat. The bo staff in his body rapidly and ferociously increased in speed and, as if he was throwing away his life, he charged straight towards the twin headed black striped snake. The speed of the bo staff reached its limit and, in a blink of an eye, dozens of shadows were smashing towards the snake!BANG! BANG!Two of the dozens of shadows smashed directly into the snake's right head. The right head of the gigantic snake couldn't help but to shake, as if it was going to faint. With a rumble, the snake's right head directly fell onto the ground.\"HISS~\" the left head of the twin headed black striped snake immediately let out a horrifying growl and its large, soft body suddenly moved. It actually shot up and speedily ran in a wavy motion.\"Hurry!\" the Indian leader, the bald brute, quickly roared.Gao Feng, who always stuck close to the twin headed black striped snake, roared: \"Die!\". He used all of the power in his body to ferociously swing the heavy hammer in his hand. The heavy hammer was like an artillery shell as it cruelly smashed towards the left head of the twin headed black striped snake. The left head of the twin headed black striped snake immediately dodged away. Luo Feng, who wasn't too far away, saw this and concentrated all of his spiritual force on the heavy hammer, instantly accelerating it by a huge margin!\"PENG!\"The twin headed black striped snake instantly dodged away. But even though the heavy hammer didn't directly hit its head, it still hit the neck!With Gao Feng's extreme power and Luo Feng's spiritual force as support, the force of impact of this hammer was unrivaled. The left head of the twin headed black striped snake also couldn't help but to fall to the ground with a dizzy motion. But right when it regained consciousness and was going to raise its head back up!Luo Feng let out a smile!\"PUCHI!\" a black knife instantly came out of the ground, went along the face of the left head of the snake, and directly shot into the head!The left head didn't rise up again.\"PU!\" The alloyed bo staff of the bald brute Indian leader shot like lightning towards the eye of the right head, destroyed it, and then pierced the right head of the twin headed black striped snake! The twin headed black stripe snake already lost its life, but its gigantic body was still twisting around unconsciously. The movements slowed down and then it never moved again!\"Haha!\" The Indian leader couldn't help but to laugh loudly.\"Beautiful\" Gao Feng was also happy as he went to pick up his hammer. Luo Feng was also smiling as he went to pick up his throwing knives.From beginning to end, the Indians probably never realized that their weapons were being controlled by spiritual force!Especially the last hit. Only until the head of the twin headed black striped snake fell on the ground did Luo Feng's throwing knife come out of the ground to pierce its head.\"Friend\" the bald brute smiled towards Luo Feng and Gao Feng and made a greeting, \"Good!*\"TL note: He said \"good\" in english.\"You aren't so bad either\" laughed Luo Feng as he said. He could tell that the Indian staked his life on his final move. Even now, the bald brute's face was completely flushed and his veins were still bursting.\"You guys get half, we get half!\" spoke the bald brute.Luo Feng pointed at the left head of the snake and slightly smiled: \"The scales are half half too\".Both sides felt each other's strength. Whether Luo Feng's squad or the Indian squad, both probably have heated weapons aiming from a hidden area. That, and both parties are powerful. So both of them were in a good mood. Luo Feng and Gao Feng started dissecting the left head of the twin headed black striped snake!And the Indians dissected the right head.\"Luo Feng, that blade was cruel\" whispered Gao Feng.Luo Feng laughed as he took out the black throwing knife from the head of the snake after dissecting it. It was indeed that strike that killed the left head.Suddenly--\"Hm?\"Luo Feng and Gao Feng quickly turned over to look, and the faces of the three members of the Indian squad also changed as they looked.Nine human fighters from not too far away started walking towards them; most of them were yellow. When these nine people came and saw the gigantic snake in front of them, they instantly determined the price of it--a few billion dollars. With such a huge amount of wealth, quite a few people would show their inner greed.\"Please go away!\" the bald brute leader of the Indian group squeezed out some chinese.\"Who would've thought that we'd meet the tiger fang squad here too. You sure linger around us\" Gao Feng's gaze scanned across the group in front of him.Luo Feng looked silently. Out of the nine people in front of them, other than the six members of the tiger fang squad, there was an old veteran, a huge white brute, and a mixed youth.\"Haha, Gao Feng, you guys actually teamed up with Indians. Hmhm..... but for you guys to kill this twin headed black striped snake, how rare\" the captain of the tiger fang squad laughed coldly, \"If you're wise, you'd hurry up and **** off. If so, our thunderbolt squad might spare your lives, or else..... hmhm, don't blame us. Oh, senior Liu here is the captain of our thunderbolt squad. Mr. Ka Long here is our vice captain\".Senior Liu was that old veteran, and Ka Long was that white brute.Luo Feng's gaze was cold.\"This is my first time here in #003 city, this prey is mine. You guys can leave\" said the mixed youth as he smiled.The old veteran and the white brute stood on the two sides of the mixed youth as they scanned Luo Feng's group.\"Whoever dares to steal my prey..... dies!\" said the bald brute leader of the Indian group. The two scimitar wielding Indians beside him were also displaying their killing intent. Do you think killing this twin headed black striped snake was easy? First of all, this valuable, mutated monster was already rare in the first place, and the battle was bitter too.Gao Feng also held his twin hammers with a fearsome gaze.\"If you want to steal it, then come\" Luo Feng stepped on the head of the snake and gave out a cold laugh as he looked at the group in front of him, \"If we can kill this twin headed black striped snake, then your group..... oh yea, our brother's sniper rifle is aimed right at your group!\"\"Our sniper rifle is also aimed at you!\" said one of the scimitar wielding men of the Indian group coldly.\"Sniper?\"Quite a few of the nine couldn't help but to raise their heads to the surrounding residential apartments, but not even a shadow could be seen in these ruined buildings. But because they couldn't see them, they became even more afraid. The tiger fang squad was clear: the fire hammer squad had Chen Gu as their sniper. And would the Indian group not bring their own professional snipers too?----TL note (for the 7 inches part): Okay, for those interested/want more information, this is actually a saying: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u07f4\ufffd\ufffd\u07f4\ufffd (if you want to attack a snake, attack at 7 inches). I heard there are variations like 3 inches too, but there are two meanings for this saying. First, don't attack a snake if it isn't at least 7 inches long. Next, 7 inches is the best spot to attack a snake. Refer to the photos below (although I'm not sure if these photos are exactly correct. I'm sure that it varies for different types of snakes).Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUsually, a heavy sniper rifle can barely threaten a 'low level commander level' monster. But monsters are different from humans. Humans are powerful, but the defense of their skin and muscle is much lower than the defense of the monsters' fur and scales. This is also why human fighters have to wear battle uniforms!If an intermediate level warlord fighter gets shot, even if he doesn't die, he would still suffer a heavy wound.However, a sniper rifle is much less threatening to an advanced level warlord level fighter, and as for a wargod? A sniper rifle can't even threaten a wargod at all.\"It looks like the old veteran and the white brute are protecting the mixed youth, so he's the most important member of the squad\" Luo Feng's gaze scanned across the thunderbolt squad. Some of the members of the thunderbolt squad were raised towards the residential apartments, searching for the snipers' locations. And some of them exchanged glances.Silence.Luo Feng, Gao Feng, the Indians, and the thunderbolt squad were all silent for a bit.\"Senior Liu\" the tiger fang captain looked towards the indifferent, balding veteran. This balding veteran frowned and looked at him, and the tiger fang captain immediately shut up. The old, balding veteran then said quietly to the mixed youth's ear: \"Young master, since you want to come here to train, you should fight against the monsters personally\".The mixed youth looked at the veteran and then turned his head to the white brute. The white brute also slightly nodded.\"Alright, let's go!\" ordered the mixed youth helplessly.His father has seriously warned him--After entering the wilderness, he must listen to his two bodyguards.Even though the leader of the squad is technically the old veteran, but the actual leader is this mixed youth. And now that the mixed youth gave his order, the members of the tiger fang squad stared at Gao Feng and Luo Feng with a look of dissatisfaction. Zhang Ze Hu even cursed under his breath: \"Luo Feng kid, you got lucky this time!\". Zhang Ze Hu didn't even try to hide his hatred for Luo Feng.It has always been clear that the tiger fang squad and the fire hammer squad weren't on good terms.Very quickly, the nine members of the thunderbolt squad left.Wan-Ke Dream city is gigantic in area, and the thunderbolt squad continued to move forward in this small sector.\"Pan Ya\" as they walked on the road, the old veteran frowned as he spoke.\"Senior Liu\" the captain of the tiger fang squad neared and lowered himself.The old veteran named Liu spoke solemnly: \"Since you tiger fang squad members accepted this mission, you should know that the young master's safety takes priority over everything! That twin headed black striped snake is indeed a treasure, but is not even close to the importance of young master's safety. If something happened to the young master, not only will I not be able to escape, but all of you tiger fang squad members will die too!\".The tiger fang squad captain froze, and soon nodded: \"Understood!\".\"Ok, as long as you understand\" said the old veteran named Liu coldly, \"We'll soon arrive at a ruined JJ liquor chain store. The young master will then kill the monsters in that area. If you guys want to steal others' prey, do it yourselves. Don't drag in the young master\".\"I understand\".The captain of the tiger fang squad replied that, but was cursing in his heart.Which fighter squad in the vicinity of #003 city is weak? If it wasn't for the two 'advanced level warlords', the old veteran named Liu and the white brute, the tiger fang squad doesn't even have the power to steal prey.The tiger fang captain slightly nodded: \"I understand. The fire hammer squad dared to enter #003 city, so I understand that their skill has increased\".\"Captain, we can't delay anymore. Especially that Luo Feng, he just became a fighter not too recently. I heard he's already a beginner level warlord\" said Zhang Ze Hu hurriedly. Zhang Ze Hu is clearly the one who holds the most hatred for Luo Feng.\"This kid, does have surprising potential\".The tiger fang captain said lowly, \"Leaving our enemies like that will just make their threat to us larger and larger! Since we met them in the wilderness this time, well good, I'll think of a way in these few days to kill them directly! Or else..... I'll spend some money and ask senior Liu and the other senior to help\".On the grass of the residential apartments filled with the scent of blood, Luo Feng, Gao Feng, and the three Indians were dissecting the gigantic snake. Not only did they take out the poison sacs, but they also took out things like the bladder. Of course, they'll have to skin it. The skin of this twin headed black striped snake is worth quite a bit.\"Half!\"\"Half!\"The Indian group and Luo Feng's group quickly split apart the large amounts of material.\"No matter toughness or hardness, the scales of this snake is amazing\" Gao Feng couldn't help but to say as he touched the scales, \"These scales are definitely important materials for battle uniform production!\". The most important invention by man--Ke Luo Alloy, is mainly made from all sorts of monsters' material.Of course, it was the 'Blue Gold' metal found on the moon that finally made the Ke Luo alloy! Ke Luo alloy allows human fighters to wear battle uniforms with extremely high defense and wield blades that are unrivaled in sharpness! Even some heated weapons gain a huge increase in power.\"Cooperate, great!\" the Indian leader, the bald brute, squeezed out some Chinese as he greeted Luo Feng and Gao Feng.\"Haha, great\" Gao Feng also laughed.Luo Feng and Gao Feng both carried their bulging bags and headed upstairs. The snake's scales seemed to have a huge area, but they were actually very thin. Half of the snakes' scales stacked together can't even fill up one bag! And fighter's bags already had amazing elasticity. With the bag's mechanism, you can adjust the size of the bag.At its largest, you can make it as large as a regular man. However, that size isn't needed for these scales.They quickly arrived at the 12th floor of the residential building. Right when they entered, they were greeted with cheering.\"Warm welcome, warm welcome\" shouted Wei Tie purposefully.\"Welcome back, captain and Luo Feng, from your battle\" Chen Gu also said purposefully. Of course they were happy. Since Luo Feng and Gao Feng came back successfully, they would get quite a bit of money too.Gao Feng didn't have such a happy look on his face: \"You guys saw the members of the tiger fang squad right?\".\"We saw them\" the faces of Chen Gu, Wei Tie, and Wei Qing immediately sank. Chen Gu even grit his teeth: \"I even wanted to shoot them in revenge for old Zhang!\". Out of the entire squad, Chen Gu was clearly the closest to Zhang Ke, since they were both from Ming-Yue sector.Together throughout the life threatening times, together as they went back home.All these years, they're even closer than brothers! But Chen Gu knew he couldn't fire back them. Even if he was able to kill someone, the thunderbolt squad would certainly immediately take action..... at that point, there's no turning back.\"Chen Gu, where's the tiger fang squad right now?\" asked Luo Feng.\"We've been watching them the whole time\"At the northern window, Wei Qing held his binoculars as he looked down, \"that group just walked out of the dream city sector and are walking east along that street!\".Whoosh! Whoosh!Luo Feng and the others immediately went. Luo Feng first took the binoculars and looked downwards. Indeed..... the nine members of the thunderbolt squad were walking along a street a few miles away. Thankfully, Luo Feng and the others picked a good residential building, a tall building that was farthest up north in their sector. In front of their residential building towards the northern sector were just some short buildings, so they could freely look towards the northern area.\"Captain, brother Chen\" spoke Luo Feng.\"Hm?\" the members of the fire hammer squad all looked towards Luo Feng.Luo Feng couldn't help but to clench his fists and say with his teeth clenched: \"I'll never forget what they did to brother Zhang. I swore long ago..... once I meet the trash of the tiger fang squad in the wilderness, I'll destroy them!\"\"Luo Feng, your point is?\" said Gao Feng in a surprised tone.\"I'll go after them secretly and find a chance to kill all the members of the tiger fang squad! Since they were prepared to kill all of us, of course we have to strike first!\". Luo Feng will never forget the two sniper rifle bullets. One of them was barely dodged thanks to his spiritual force.But the other one handicapped brother Zhang!\"Luo Feng, I'll go with you. We have to avenge brother Zhang\" said Chen Gu with his teeth clenched.\"Brother Chen, going alone is best for me\" Luo Feng said in a low tone, \"With my spiritual force, I can escape even from a wargod just by flying!\".This is why spirit readers are horrifying!Even if a wargod fighter is tens to hundreds of times stronger than them, even a weak spirit reader can fly! Other than spirit readers, only existences that surpass the wargod level can fly.\"Chen Gu, Luo Feng is right. You'll just be a burden\" commanded Gao Feng.Chen Gu clenched his teeth. The captain said it in a bad way, but he knew the captain said it for his own good.\"And if we want to destroy the tiger fang squad, then wouldn't they try to destroy us too?\" said Gao Feng, \"Ever since their scheme from last time, of course they wouldn't want us to live. However, they just haven't met us in the wilderness. Now that they've met us..... they'll take action for sure\".Everyone there was surprised.Indeed.....With the way the tiger fang squad handles things, they'll definitely do something like this.\"We killed enough monsters this time anyway and our bags are almost full. The other members of the squad will first return to the resupplying base\" said Gao Feng, and then looked towards Luo Feng, \"Luo Feng, you're a spirit reader. No one knows how many times better you are at escaping than us, but you still have to be careful and not let your guard down\".Luo Feng nodded.As they talked, the members took up their binoculars and observed where the thunderbolt squad was headed.\"They entered the JJ liquor chain store\" said Chen Gu excitedly, \"Looks like that'll be their temporary base\".\"No delay, let's go now\" said Gao Feng clearly.Luo Feng also stood up and saw the captain and the others off.This was already the border of the city, so Luo Feng saw the captain and the others off in just two to three miles on the highway. After leaving the #003 city section, there were barely any monsters. It'll be weird if something happens to the fire hammer squad on the highway with their current strength.\"Luo Feng, be careful\" Gao Feng and the other members of the fire hammer squad looked towards Luo Feng.This time, Luo Feng is going to take up the fire hammer squad's task alone.\"Captain, don't worry, none of the members of the tiger fang squad will make it out alive!\" laughed Luo Feng, and then he became a shadow and disappeared into the distance and towards the city densely filled with buildings far away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt times, Luo Feng would sprint, and at times, Luo Feng would suddenly hide behind a wall, waiting for the hungry monsters to pass by. Only until they pass does Luo Feng start moving forward again!With his spiritual force scanning the area, Luo Feng can correctly determine whether or not there's danger ahead.\"This house then!\" like a cannonball, Luo Feng directly flew into the third story's window of a three story villa.Since no one has lived here for dozens of years, the room was long filled with dust. However, a few electronic household appliances could be discerned with just a look. It's just that most of them were already split apart and broken. Luo Feng quickly flipped the Simmons mattress, since the opposite side was much cleaner. After a bit of cleaning up, he can sleep on it.After putting his bag down, Luo Feng took out his binoculars and went to the northern window.The window had tons of dust all over it, making the once transparent window seem like a black window. After opening the window halfway, Luo Feng took his binoculars and looked towards the north. His current position is within Wan-Ke dream city's inner sector. From here, he can clearly see the northern JJ liquor chain store.He can also see the street in front of the liquor store. Since there's only a difference of two miles between the street and his villa, with Luo Feng's eyesight, he doesn't even need binoculars to see what's happening on the street. But with the binoculars, he can see more clearly.\"JJ\" Luo Feng stood in front of the window and watched silently.5 minutes later.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng let out a face of happiness, \"It was originally that building!\". Through the binoculars, Luo Feng could see two people standing on the rooftop of the six story liquor chain store five miles away. They were both currently holding binoculars, and the two were Zhang Ze Hu and a gunner named Li Xiao.\"I have to wait for my chance\" Luo Feng put down his binoculars and started his days of observation.At this time, inside the JJ liquor chain store.The tiger fang captain said coldly: \"Tiger, Xiao, both of you look closely! We must find out where the fire hammer squad is hiding! Since their team's Chen Gu has to use his sniper rifle, then they must be at a high location! So you guys look towards the higher levels of the tall buildings and search for them\".\"Yes, captain\" Zhang Ze Hu and Xiao stood on the rooftop and, through their binoculars, continuously searched the tall buildings in Wan-Ke dream city.\"Pan Ya, the information you told me about the fire hammer squad is correct, right?\" the old veteran, whose hair was gray, frowned.The tiger fang captain followed: \"There is definitely no problem. The information for these six people are extremely accurate..... only this Luo Feng's info is changing. He was scouted by the Dojo of Limits and is extremely talented. His strength has already reached the beginner warlord level\".\"Okay\".The old veteran named Liu slightly nodded, \"If so, Pan Ya, find me after you have located the fire hammer squad's position\".\"Okay\" the tiger fang captain responded as he smiled.Unfortunately, the tiger fang squad couldn't even find the fire hammer squad's shadow. Dawn of the next day.\"Young master, according to the plan, young master's goal at dawn today is that low level commander monster. That monster is high in power but low in speed. At that time, Ka Long and I won't help\" smiled the old veteran Liu. The mixed youth laughed: \"Okay, you and Ka Long watch on the side. I'll take care of it myself\".The white brute also smiled.\"Pan Ya\" the old veteran named Liu turned his head and commanded, \"The two members of the tiger fang squad that were on night watch can rest today, the rest of the members will come with us\".\"Understood\" the tiger fang captain, Pan Ya, smiled.As of now, the tiger fang squad consists of two intermediate level and four beginner level warlords!\"Steel head, Dong. You two were on watch last night, so rest here today\" commanded Pan Ya. Protecting that young master is their first priority, so naturally, the members they leave behind are the weakest two..... and of course, the two are picked from the four beginner warlords.Today it was steel head and Dong. Tomorrow it'll be tiger and Xiao. Taking turns.\"Understood\" the bald brute and Dong, who was cleaning his gun, smiled.\"Let's go\" commanded the old veteran named Liu.The mixed youth, the old veteran named Liu, the white brute, and the four members of the tiger fang squad. The seven of them left the liquor store, leaving behind the bald brute and Dong in the spacious room.\"Damn, having a powerful father is just great\" the bald brute couldn't help but to say, \"To gain experience with fighting against monsters, two advanced level warlords can be summoned as bodyguards. Even our whole squad is here to cover him. Hmhm..... when I came out here in the wilderness the other year, I had to bring out everything I had with my life on the line\".Dong laughed: \"How can we compare with him? Didn't you hear him..... that senior Liu or whatever. He even said in a tone of a butler--'The young master's goal for today is a low level commander monster who is high in power and low in speed'. ****, he even has the training session all scheduled out! Which monster to kill first and which monster to kill next!\".In a dangerous place like the wilderness.When does the fighter ever have the chance to decide anything!If you encounter a powerful monster, can you just immediately shout 'I'm not fighting this monster'? If you don't fight, then the monster will chase after you and force you to act.\"But that young master is different. If they encounter a powerful monster, then that senior Liu can just take care of it. They'll especially wait for a low level commander monster for their young master to practice on\" laughed the bald brute as he shook his head.Luo Feng, who woke up early in the morning and was already squatting in wait, quickly saw the seven members of the thunderbolt squad walk out the liquor store.\"Seven? Wasn't there nine in total?\".Luo Feng immediately thought, \"Then the other two must still be inside the liquor store!\".Luo Feng understood his strength well.Against an 'intermediate level warlord', he can certainly wipe the floor with them. However, it's hard to say about what will happen if he fights against an 'advanced level warlord'. For example, he might be able to instantly kill his opponent if he attacks them by surprise, but if that fails..... then there'll be a problem. Since in a frontal fight, an advanced level warlord can immediately dodge away from a sniper rifle bullet.An advanced level warlord's reaction speed is much higher than his own.\"Out of the nine members of the thunderbolt squad, that white brute and the old veteran named Liu are most likely advanced level warlords. Or else they wouldn't have been so arrogant and have tried to steal the twin headed black striped snake's corpse\".\"Let's say that I go alone and face all nine of them! With a surprise attack and some luck, I might be able to succeed. However..... only one of them has to spread the word that I'm the murderer to the world via their communications watch and, once that happens, I'll be in huge trouble\". Luo Feng understood that, from the old veteran named Liu and the white brute's attitude towards that mixed youth and how they call him 'young master'.....That mixed youth's background is extremely horrifying!Since that person can get two advanced warlords as bodyguards, then that big person behind the mixed youth is at least a wargod! Or maybe even a position higher than a wargod!\"Right now, there are only two people in the liquor store, should I kill them?\".Luo Feng hesitated, and then decided against it.\"I can't kill them. If I kill these two, then the other seven will be on guard. If so, then it'll be much more troublesome to kill the tiger fang captain and Zhang Ze Hu\".\"I don't believe that my chance won't come!\"Day after day passed, and the thunderbolt squad never found the fire hammer squad. And Luo Feng never found a good chance to strike! Everytime the thunderbolt squad left the liquor store, only the two people who were on night watch remain. First it's steel head and Dong, then it's Tiger and Xiao.And they took turns.....Luo Feng waited for nine whole days!\"****!\"\"They're too systematic!\" Luo Feng had a bitter face on, \"This thunderbolt squad is just that young master's nanny squad!\". Not only did Luo Feng watch the liquor store, but he also watched the seven people that came out to hunt these past few days. He tried to see if he could find a moment where the tiger fang squad was separated from the old veteran named Liu and the white brute.But, not even one moment was found!The thunderbolt squad was always protecting that mixed youth and never strayed too far, giving Luo Feng no chance at all.The tenth day!\"If I keep waiting like this, then I'll probably never get a chance by the time they start to return to the headquarter city! I can't wait anymore!\" Luo Feng clenched his teeth and a cold light flashed across his eyes, \"Today is the tenth day, so it should be Zhang Ze Hu and that gunner Li Xiao guarding the liquor store..... Zhang Ze Hu, hmph, I'll destroy both of you two today!\".At the JJ liquor chain store.\"Tiger, Xiao, you two haven't slept all night so take a good rest now\" said the tiger fang captain and he smiled.\"Understood, captain\".Zhang Ze Hu and Li Xiao both smiled as they replied.\"Let's go\"With a command from the old veteran named Liu, the tiger fang squad and the others followed him. A total of seven people left the liquor store. And Luo Feng, who saw that the seven people have left the store, quietly left his own spot and went along another road headed towards the liquor store.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe dawn of winter was quite cold, and some of the monsters' corpses on the ground were freezing up. Luo Feng slowly walked on this road, and there were two shadow cats enjoyably feasting on a wild boar's flesh. However, right when they realized someone was coming, they quickly hid.Monsters had some intelligence too. In #003 city, all the humans meddling around here were very powerful, so one or two soldier level monsters can't stop them at all.\"Those two shadow cats probably went to summon the other shadow cats\".Luo Feng swiftly went through the road and continued going forward, going around in a huge circle on purpose to waste some time. He slowly moved forward, and took around half an hour to arrive at the northern door of the liquor store.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe door to the liquor store was extremely dirty, and there was some black colored blood that not even rain can wash away on the ground. Luo Feng stood alone there.\"It's been half an hour already, so the seven members of the thunderbolt squad have probably walked far away by now\". Luo Feng looked at the door in front of him that has been long broken, and immediately focused his spiritual force onto his armbands, the shield on his back, and his blade. This powerful force made Luo Feng's body extremely light; every one of his steps became light.\"Upstairs!\"He went along the staircase step by step without making even the slightest sound.Luo Feng was extremely careful, but right when he reached the third floor, with a glance, he saw that there was a huge mastiff tiger that was slowly moving forward. That mastiff tiger also instantly found this human fighter, Luo Feng! Both of them practically noticed each other at the exact same time, and Luo Feng was so scared he immediately broke out in a cold sweat!Whoosh! Whoosh!Two black shadows basically instantly drew across the mastiff tiger monster, and its gigantic head fell off before it even had the chance to roar. The two throwing knives flew around in a circle and then landed in the outer pockets of his pants.\"Phew, no problem\" Luo Feng was relieved, \"Thankfully this monster didn't remember to roar. If it attracted Zhang Ze Hu and Li Xiao's attention, then there would be some trouble\".Even though killing Zhang Ze Hu and Li Xiao is as easy as killing chickens.But if Zhang Ze Hu and Li Xiao were cautious, then they might be able to contact the other members of the thunderbolt squad right before they die..... once the other members of the thunderbolt squad know that there's a human fighter targeting them, then Luo Feng's next action would be tens to hundreds of times harder to carry out.\"Sixth floor!\"Luo Feng couldn't help but to let out a smile when he reached the sixth floor, luckily he only encountered one monster on the way to the sixth floor. The thunderbolt squad probably quickly scanned the building the first time they came here, and that mastiff tiger monster probably just entered the liquor store not too long ago.On the hallway of the sixth floor, Luo Feng slowly moved forward.\"In the room with the window pointed towards the south, the eighth window from east to west\". Luo Feng couldn't be sure as to which room this eighth window corresponded to.\"It's probably one of these three or four rooms\".Luo Feng held his breath and his light body made no sound. He walked into one of the rooms and stopped, then put his ear near the wall and listened carefully. Indeed, he could slightly hear some chatting sounds, which made Luo Feng determine that those two were in that room. He then quietly walked outside the room.\"It should be this room\" Luo Feng scanned the situation of the room with his spiritual force.\"They're just chatting there?\" Luo Feng laughed.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdInside the room.Zhang Ze Hu was currently sitting against the broken sofa, while Li Xiao was cleaning the machine gun in his hand. Both of them were nonchalantly chatting.\"That fire hammer squad sure has no balls. Last time they met us, they directly ran straight back to the resupplying base. No wonder we couldn't find them no matter how long we searched\" insulted Zhang Ze Hu as he said. Li Xiao laughed coldly: \"They can escape for now, but not forever. Since we're enemies now, they're dead for sure\".Zhang Ze Hu sneered: \"They think they can fight against us with just them? Hm?\".Zhang Ze Hu's face slightly changed, and Li Xiao's face also slightly changed.\"I felt like there was something just now\" Zhang Ze Hu looked towards Li Xiao. Li Xiao also frowned as he said: \"I also, felt something\".Since fighters are always on the border of life and death, they'll have some feeling in their heart when they encounter danger. And they had such an obvious feeling because..... Luo Feng scanned the room with his spiritual force. When this spiritual force spreads out, regular people have a hard time noticing it, but powerful fighters will still have some feeling of it.\"Could there be a monster outside?\" said Zhang Ze Hu quietly.\"Probably\" Li Xiao nodded, \"Even though we cleaned up all the monsters in the entire liquor store when we first came, there could still be some monster horde that just entered the store\".\"KA!\"Li Xiao held his machine gun while Zhang Ze Hu held his machete. Both of them stood up and headed towards the door. After several dozen years of corrosion, the locks of these doors were long broken. With a light pull from Zhang Ze Hu, the door easily opened. And outside of the door was neither a human's shadow nor a monster's shadow.\"Not many sounds\" Zhang Ze Hu and Li Xiao exchanged glances. Zhang Ze Hu then took in a deep breath and cautiously started to exit the room.And then!Whoosh! Whoosh!Two eerie, black lights instantly appeared in front of Zhang Ze Hu and Li Xiao. One of the eerie, black lights instantly drew across Zhang Ze Hu's left arm and instantly cut his left arm off. After cutting the arm off, without slowing down, it instantly drew across gunner 'Li Xiao's neck, causing Li Xiao's head to fly up.And the second eerie, black light instantly drew across Zhang Ze Hu's throat!PUCHI! PUCHI!Fresh blood poured out.\"Eh--eh--\"Zhang Ze Hu's eyes were wide open, but he couldn't make a sound.These two black lights were way too fast. There was probably only one or two meters between Zhang Ze Hu and the black light, and Li Xiao was only three or four meters away from it. In such a short distance...... against a speed even faster than a bullet fired from a sniper rifle, how could they dodge?Maybe an advanced level warlord would have a chance of survival but, as for them, they didn't even have the tiniest chance.\"Eh--\"Zhang Ze Hu wanted to speak, but he couldn't make a sound. He wanted to press his tactical communications watch, but his left arm was already cut off and the tactical communications watch was on the ground.\"I'm going to die? How, how could I die?\"Zhang Ze Hu grabbed his throat with his right hand. As fresh blood crazily poured outside from his throat, he could clearly feel his life slowly fading away, \"How could this happen? HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN!!!\"Suddenly--A shadow appeared at the door, wearing a fighter's battle uniform, alloyed boots, and had a shield and blade on his back. His two eyes were coldly staring at him.\"Eh!\" Zhang Ze Hu's eyes instantly became round as he stared, as he couldn't believe which fighter was in front of him!Luo Feng!It was actually Luo Feng!It was actually that rookie Luo Feng who he didn't take seriously at all???\"You go on first, the other members of the tiger fang squad will join you soon enough\" Luo Feng's voice rang. Zhang Ze Hu's mouth was wide open, but with his throat slit, he couldn't say anything at all. And as Zhang Ze Hu felt his vision starting to fade, the two eerie, black lights returned to Luo Feng and hovered in front of him. Clearly, they were two throwing knives.The two throwing knives just hovered like this, and then landed inside Luo Feng's thigh's pockets.\"Ah, ah!\" Zhang Ze Hu's eyes were wide open as if he wanted to say something, but his body froze and instantly, lifelessly fell to the ground.Before dying.....He finally realized Luo Feng's biggest secret--Luo Feng was actually a spirit reader!!! Before dying, Zhang Ze Hu saw the grave, nightmarish future of all the members of his tiger fang squad.Silence!Only the 'DRIP' sound from the blood hitting the ground rang throughout the room; there was no other sound. The two corpses just lay there, and Luo Feng silently stood there as he looked.\"Zhang Ze Hu\" Luo Feng lowered his head as he looked at the person in front of him.Right from the start, Zhang Ze Hu thought he was a seasoned veteran while Luo Feng was just a rookie. So that's why he didn't lower his head at all when they were discussing about Zhang Hao Bai's case. And it was then that Luo Feng's spiritual force awakened.That argument was just a small case.If you want a reason, then blame the time where the tiger fang squad tried to kill everyone in the fire hammer squad. Thankfully, Luo Feng managed to save everyone in the end, but even so, Zhang Ke still lost his arm.Because of that, the fire hammer squad clenched their teeth as they swore for revenge.The tiger fang squad also feared that the enemy would grow strong, so they tried to destroy them completely! Both of squads wouldn't rest until one side was dead!\"With Zhang Ze Hu and Li Xiao's death, there are still four members of the six tiger fang squad members remaining\" Luo Feng stood at the door as he thought to himself, \"Once they come back here and realize that these two have been killed, they'll certainly get cautious and think about the various possibilities! Then..... I have to decorate this scene and trick them. It's up to the heavens whether or not this works\".Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For his plan, he wants to trick the other seven members of the thunderbolt squad into thinking that Zhang Ze Hu and Li Xiao were killed by monsters.After that, Luo Feng sprinted along the alley towards the outer area. After leaving the alley, with a glance, he noticed a large horde of horned boars. There were at least one hundred of them. If a regular fighter saw this, they probably wouldn't even have time to run away, but Luo Feng let out a smile.\"It'll be them\" Luo Feng swiftly got closer to them.\"HOWL~~\"Quite a few horned boars were staring at this human fighter. One enraged roar carried from the horde, which was from the leader of this horned boar horde! Suddenly, all the horned boars spread out and crazily rushed towards Luo Feng. In an instant, the entire street started rumbling.RUMBLE~~ The horned boar horde came rushing!\"****, I was going to kill one or two monsters first to make them hate me first. I didn't know it would be this easy to get them to chase after me\" Luo Feng turned around and started running away. He quickly headed towards the alley and started running in there.RUMBLE~~The alley was quite wide, so two horned boars could run in it side by side. Luo Feng was sprinting ahead while the horde of horned boars were crazily chasing from behind.\"PUCHI!\" \"PUCHI!\"Two eerie black lights flew around a circle and returned to Luo Feng. The two horned boars in front of the horde instantly died, and another horned boar behind them also had a gigantic wound. At this time, the horned boars' enraged howls became even louder, showing that they were clearly even more enraged.\"The angrier the better!\" Luo Feng, like lightning, went up the stairs past the backdoor of the liquor store.RUMBLE~~The horned boars crazily flew up the stairs one by one. The quality of the concrete making up the stairs was pretty good; even after a dozen years, it can still support the running of the horned boars. Luo Feng purposefully ran ahead the horde by around 10 meters and rushed to his destination--sixth floor!After arriving at the sixth floor, under the effects of Luo Feng's spiritual force, Zhang Ze Hu's machete and Li Xiao's machine gun started hovering. The machine gun even dragged along the long, long bullet chain with it.The machine gun floated in front of Luo Feng, and so did the machete.\"HOWL~~\" the monsters, like a flood, rushed into the sixth floor. Each of them went along the hallway as they crazily charged towards Luo Feng.\"Come at me!\"Luo Feng sneered and a crazed light appeared in his eye. His spiritual force pulled the trigger, and the large barrel of the machine gun started roaring as it crazily fired bullets out one by one. The force of each boar's charge was absurd, so even though the bullets crazily shot into the horned boars, they couldn't make them stop!Puchi! Puchi!The floating machete started crazily dancing around, drawing across the throats of the horned boars one after another. The bodies of the boars that lost control started slamming into the walls, \"RUMBLE~~\" , the walls started splitting apart after getting slammed into so many times. With the power of both the machine gun and the machete, dozens of horned boars were killed in a breath. The hallway was filled with corpses.\"HOWL~~\" an enraged roar came.A huge horned boar with black spots and shining silver fur appeared.However, the machete and machine gun already fell beside the two corpses in the room, and Luo Feng himself has long jumped out the northern window!Whoosh!Luo Feng shot down the window like lightning and, using his spiritual force on both of his arm guards, created an uplifting force which slowed him down. Luo Feng easily landed on the roof of a two story building, sprinted right into an alley, and quickly disappeared.......\"HOWL~~\"The horned boar horde, which lost a couple dozen monsters, madly rammed the insides of the liquor store as they tried to find that damned human fighter. They didn't find that human fighter, but they did find two fresh human fighter corpses. These horned boars then immediately crazily chewed up the flesh of these corpses.To horned boars, the flesh of humans is indeed a delicacy.Even more horned boars went for the corpses of the dead horned boars! For the monsters that live in such cruel environments, they are rarely able to eat any humans, so they mostly eat other monsters' corpses..... for especially savage monsters, eating corpses from the same species is very normal.Whether the human corpses or the horned boar corpses, they quickly became a pile of crushed bones.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdLuo Feng snuck back to his original spot and watched silently.\"The seven members of the thunderbolt squad will probably come back in around two hours\". Luo Feng finally saw the seven people in his field of vision, \"Well yeah, you could hear the roars of the monsters everywhere in #003 city, and the battle just now occurred in the liquor store..... since the thunderbolt squad is only a few miles away, it'll be weird if they didn't notice\".......In front of the liquor store, the seven high-spirited members of the thunderbolt squad laughed as they returned.\"Young master's blade just now was beautiful, it so accurately drew across the throat of that commander level monster, 'Rapid Wolf'\" the captain of the tiger fang squad smiled as he praised, but his expression suddenly froze.\"Hm?\"The tiger fang captain looked towards the interior of the liquor store, and the other members of the thunderbolt squad did the same.\"The scent of blood!\" the old veteran named Liu directly walked into the liquor store, and the others followed, \"The scent of blood became stronger\".\"A large scale battle happened here, one or two monsters can't have such a heavy scent of blood\" the tiger fang captain frowned, and the one eyed middle aged man beside him immediately pressed his tactical communications watch and yelled: \"Tiger, Xiao! Tiger, Xiao, both of you hurry and respond. What happened?\".The faces of the four members of the tiger fang squad all changed.\"Captain, they didn't reply\" the one eyed middle aged man looked towards his captain.\"Maybe they didn't notice that their watches were vibrating\" the bald brute couldn't help but to say.Fighters are all extremely sensitive, how can they not notice?The tiger fang captain said quietly: \"Let's go take a look upstairs\".\"Go, let's go see\" the old veteran named Liu also commanded. Soon, the seven of them all arrived at the staircase, but after seeing the marks on the staircase in front of them, all of their faces changed slightly. Clearly, this staircase was just stomped on by a huge amount of monsters; quite a bit of the concrete was already split open.\"Everyone be careful\"The seven of them carefully and slowly moved forward.Even though they went slowly, they arrived at the sixth floor without spending too much time.\"Hu!\" the seven members of the thunderbolt squad all took in a deep breath. The entire sixth floor of the liquor store was clearly a huge mess. The walls of the rooms of the liquor store were smashed to pieces, the floor was filled with marks of blood, and there were large amounts of crushed bones from corpses, most of them being from monsters.All the hearts of the seven members of the thunderbolt squad sank, they knew..... that Zhang Ze Hu and Li Xiao weren't lucky today.\"Look, there are even bullet holes on the wall\"\"There are quite a few bullet shells on the ground. Xiao probably fired his machine gun to try and stop the monster horde. Sadly, there were just too many of them\".Everyone quickly found various marks.Soon after, everyone looked at the ripped up battle uniform, the slightly deformed machete, the completely smashed up machine gun, and a few human bones.\"Tiger's machete and Xiao's gun\"\"These two battle uniforms......\"The battle uniforms were extremely sturdy. Even though they were chewed up by the horned boars and were in tatters, they could still be made out. They were precisely Zhang Ze Hu and Li Xiao's battle uniforms.\"How could this happen?\" the bald brute couldn't help but to clench his teeth as he said, \"Tiger and Xiao were in their room. How could they be so unlucky to meet a hungry monster horde?\"\"Go, let's go downstairs!\" the old veteran named Liu suddenly ordered.\"Downstairs?\" the one eyed middle aged man, the bald brute, and Dong were all shocked, and then were slightly angry.The tiger fang captain frowned as he ordered: \"Alright, tidy up Tiger and Xiao's remains and then go downstairs!\". Since their captain gave an order, of course they wouldn't dare to refuse.......Moments later, the seven members of the thunderbolt squad stood in the lobby of the liquor store's first floor.\"Everyone should know\" the tiger fang captain, 'Pan Ya', said quietly, \"With Tiger and Xiao being as cautious as they are, even if a monster horde enters the liquor store, they should have had over a 50% chance of escaping! Even if they couldn't escape, they should have been able to contact us once they noticed danger!\".The faces of the other members slightly changed and couldn't help but to nod their heads.\"Indeed\" the old veteran named Liu nodded and said, \"It's suspicious because these two didn't contact us at all before dying. So I'm worried that someone purposefully set up the scene and left a listening device at the scene. That's why I brought everyone downstairs to discuss about this\".The other members of the tiger fang squad couldn't help but to respect the old veteran named Liu even more.To be able to instantly find the problem and make his decision, old veterans are clearly more experienced.\"This is one possibility, the other possibility is...... the commander level monster in the monster horde! Once they found the traces of those two, they sneakily attacked them. Huge amounts of monsters rushing upstairs...... under such an urgent situation, the two of them didn't have the chance to contact us\" the old veteran named Liu continued speaking.The four members of the tiger fang squad exchanged glances.The mixed youth let out a worried expression, and the old veteran named Liu laughed as he quietly said: \"Don't worry, young master. Even if someone made this scene, he isn't necessarily targeting you. Wargod fighters wouldn't use such tactics and warlord fighters wouldn't dare mess with you\".\"Senior Liu, taking the young master's safety into consideration, we should return back to the headquarter city\" spoke the tiger fang captain, 'Pan Ya'.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But it's even more likely that a fighter was behind this! And what kind of regular fighter would dare to go against young master Li Wei? They most likely have a grudge against my tiger fang squad!\".He was clear of this young master's identity. Even though he's a mixed youth, his father is Chinese.Whether the strength of the young master's father, or his background..... few fighters would dare to anger this young master Li Wei.\"No need\" the old veteran Liu waved his hand, \"With me and Ka Long here, the young master's safety is guaranteed\".The white brute also looked at the few members of the tiger fang squad and laughed coldly.\"Young master Li\" Pan ya couldn't help but to look at the mixed youth.\"My training schedule isn't over yet\" frowned the mixed youth.Senior Liu slightly frowned as he said, \"Fighters always walk on the border between life and death. How can you be so afraid about some uncertainties? If you're always so afraid, how can you ever accomplish anything in the future?\".Pan Ya and the others said nothing.\"You guys can just keep following us. Wouldn't that work?\" when senior Liu said this, Pan Ya and the other members of the tiger fang exchanged glances. All of them abandoned the thought of returning to the headquarter city. They were clear..... that following two advanced warlords was indeed very safe.\"Senior Liu is right. If we're always so afraid, can we even be considered as fighters? Even if someone is actually after us, right when we find him, we'll kill him directly\" a cold light flashed across Pan Ya's eyes.\"We'll listen to senior Liu\" the one eyed middle aged man laughed as he said.The members of the tiger fang squad all signalled that they'll listen to senior Liu.\"This place is full of the scent of blood, let's switch a location\" said senior Liu.Immediately, the seven members of the thunderbolt squad left the JJ liquor chain store.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdLuo Feng silently watched with his binoculars from his original location.\"They indeed left the JJ liquor chain store\" the seven members of the thunderbolt squad left the store and went along the street for quite a bit, and then disappeared from Luo Feng's field of vision.\"Shit, this villa isn't high enough so I can't see that far\".Luo Feng swiftly got his backpack, shield, and blade and flew out the villa like a jaguar. He sprinted at an astounding speed and directly rushed into the tall apartment building across the street. This apartment building was 18 stories tall. With Luo Feng's shield and blade all affected by his spiritual force, Luo Feng's speed was shocking.A shadow continuously dashed up the stairs.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Within a few seconds, he went from the first floor to the 18th floor! In one of the rooms on the 18th floor, Luo Feng stood beside the northern window and looked down through his binoculars. From such a high location, he was able to see further. He quickly found the seven members of the thunderbolt squad walking along the street. These seven people walked along for quite a bit, and then finally entered a broken residential apartment that was six stories tall.\"I wonder if the scene I made had any effect\" Luo Feng squinted, \"Whether it works or not is up to the heavens\".\"I'll keep waiting for my chance!\".Luo Feng started his days of watching again.As a fighter, you first need enough patience and determination! Without either of them, how could you ever achieve astonishing power? Naturally, Luo Feng was fine with watching alone.On the first day, the thunderbolt squad went hunting during the afternoon. This time, all seven of them left together.The second day, the thunderbolt squad went out in the morning and afternoon, allowing their mixed youth young master to train. Like before, the seven of them left together, giving Luo Feng no chance.The third day, they still went out in the morning and afternoon, and they still went out with all seven members together.\"Looks like this tiger fang squad is actually suspicious\" Luo Feng sat on the bed that he already slightly cleaned and silently looked through the window. As of now, the sky was dark and filled with stars. The starlight shone into the room through the window. The air was slightly filled with the scent of blood.\"What should I do?\" Luo Feng frowned.If it keeps going on like this, then that mixed youth young master's training schedule will finish and might return back to the headquarter city.\"Ring~~\"Luo Feng felt the tactical communications watch on his wrist vibrate slightly. When he looked down, he saw that it was a phone call from his brother.\"Recall\" commanded Luo Feng.\"Beep--beep--beep--Hello, bro!\" Luo Hua's voice came from the watch.\"Luo Hua, how come you're calling me?\" a smile filled Luo Feng's face, as he was extremely happy. Hunting down other people in the wilderness all alone is lonely..... to be able to chat with his family, his entire heart felt warm.\"I've just been thinking about you bro\" Luo Hua was clearly relaxed and happy, \"Bro, I've recently made a ton of money from my stocks again, it feels great\".\"Oh?\" How did you get the money?\" laughed Luo Feng as he asked.Luo Hua excitedly said: \"Six of the eight stocks that I've been dealing with are quality stocks, while the other two are investment ones. The quality stocks are great and earn me lots of money every year. But out of these six stocks, one of them started plunging in value rapidly! I was so scared and thought something went wrong with the company. After looking into it, I didn't find anything wrong with it! Jeez, if this happened to my investment stocks, then I would probably cut my flesh off\".\"But I have faith in these quality stocks and I'd rather hold on to them for a long period of time. And since I didn't find anything wrong with the company, there's nothing for me to be afraid of\"\"If it drops, I'll buy it!\"\"It kept falling continuously, ****, it dropped for like a dozen days and lost 50% of its value. I virtually took 80% of all my money and threw it at those stocks. Who could've knew that it would start flying up in value these past few days. Within 20 days, not only did it return to its original value, but it even went a bit higher! Jeez, just from this, I basically doubled my money. Haha, feels great\".Luo Feng could feel his brother's excitement from the tone coming from the watch.\"Nice, way better than your brother\" Luo Feng laughed as he complimented, \"Don't you have around 100 million right now?\".He gave his brother 50 million last time, so Luo Hua should have around 80 million.\"Yea, now it's around 170 million\" laughed Luo Hua, \"Bro, this is all thanks to the money you gave me. If my principal wasn't great enough, how could I earn so much money?\".Since he doubled the money.If he only had 10 thousand, he would only have 20 thousand in total.But since he had around 80 to 90 million, he turned it into 170 to 180 million. This is also why people say that your first 100 million is the hardest to earn, while your second 100 million is way easier to earn.\"You're good. Your brother has been hunting in the wilderness for around two months, but I only earned around 100 million\" said Luo Feng, but in his heart, he was amazed..... Playing around with stocks earns tons of money. You're making money with money; the more money you have, the more money you earn! Of course, you could potentially lose tons of money too.\"However, bro, these chances don't come around often\" laughed Luo Hua.Luo Hua has been playing around with stocks for years already, so making this much money in such a short time is indeed quite rare.\"Hm\"Luo Feng thought to himself while he operated his tactical communications watch. He entered his bank account and transferred 180 million to his brother's account.\"Ah!\" exclaimed Luo Hua in a surprised tone, \"Bro, my account.....\"\"Your brother just made a ton of money recently, so that's for you. Work hard and use them in the stock market. If, one day, you reach 15 billion, your brother will give you a huge surprise!\" said Luo Feng as he laughed. Luo Feng never told his brother about the 'elixir of life'.Since that thing is too expensive. But according to Luo Feng's plan, if he and his brother both earn money.....He can give some of his money to his brother, and his brother can use that money to make even more money. If they keep making money out of money, then maybe reaching 30 billion isn't impossible!\"15 billion\" exclaimed Luo Hua.\"Don't worry, I'll keep lending you money\" laughed Luo Feng. Maybe then, his money and Luo Hua's money combined will reach 30 billion.After he gets the money, he'll think of a way to purchase the 'elixir of life' so that his brother can stand up again!\"Okay, bro, I'll work hard\" said Luo Hua in a confident tone.\"Okay\" laughed Luo Feng, \"well, you should rest earlier\".\"Okay, bro, be careful in the wilderness\".The two brothers quickly finished their call.......Ming-Yue sector, Luo Feng's home. In his brother's room on the first floor, Luo Hua excitedly closed his phone and started chatting on his computer.\"Hua, look's like you're having fun\" smiled a young girl on the screen.\"Hehe, of course I'm happy\" Luo Hua excitedly chatted with this young girl on the screen. This young girl's cheeks were like a baby's and had small ears and short hair. She seemed like a very bright and pure girl. She is Luo Hua's girlfriend, 'Xiao Nan'.......Since Xiao Nan's college is right here, even if she's a college student, she's still sleeping at home.Xiao Nan was currently in her bedroom chatting with Luo Hua through her computer.And outside of her room, in the living room.A middle-aged couple was currently sitting on the sofas in the living room. Even though they were watching TV, neither of them were focusing on it.\"What should we do?\" the middle-aged woman said hurriedly, \"You know Xiao Nan's temper, if we split them apart by force, she'll surely hate us\".\"If she wants to hate us, then let her. This is for her own good!\".The middle-aged man couldn't help but to angrily say, \"She never went through any sort of hardship since she was young. Does she still think she's living in a fairytale? We aren't extremely rich, but we are still living a good life. Our girl has nice looks, so why is she with a handicapped person? That handicapped person's brother is a fighter! But so what if he's a fighter? It's not like his brother is in a relationship with our girl\".\"No matter what, I can't watch our girl jump into a fiery pit like this!\"\"If it wasn't for old Li, I never would've known that our girl was dating that Ming-Yue sector's handicapped person behind our backs. I'm so infuriated right now\" the middle-aged man's face was livid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how angry you get, it's no use. You only have this one daughter, so what can you do? Most importantly, we should think of a way to separate our daughter with that handicapped person, and try our best not to hurt our daughter's feelings\".\"I UNDERSTAND!\"The middle-aged man was then silent with a frown on his face as he smoked.The smoke from the cigarette emanated around the room, and the room remained silent for a while. The only sound was the \"Tick, Tock\" from the mechanical clock.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe second morning, #003 city was filled with a deathly, cold air as usual. And the usual heart-chilling monster roar carried from the city from time to time. If we say Jiang-Nan city is a technologically advanced city teeming with life, then this city that used to be the greatest city of China a few decades ago is now a playground for the monsters. Here, you could see the stains of blood and corpses anywhere and everywhere.This is the monster den!In that 18 story apartment that was filled with dust, Luo Feng, in his battle uniform, held his binoculars as he looked down in one hand and ate a skewer of meat on another hand, taking a bite and chewing twice before he swallowed.Chew, swallow.In the aged room, it was clearly quiet: there was only the sound of Luo Feng's chewing.\"Gulp gulp~~\" Luo Feng took out his water sack and drank a bit. After a moment, he took another drink.Luo Feng didn't bring too much food and water to the wilderness, so he has to conserve a bit every day.\"All seven of them together again!\" Luo Feng looked through his binoculars and clearly saw that the seven of them left the six story apartment building together under the morning mist. Luo Feng frowned as he angrily threw his binoculars on top of the bed on the side.Luo Feng massaged his temples and spent the whole day stooping; his eyes were extremely tired.\"All seven of them together every day. They don't give me even the slightest chance\" frowned Luo Feng, \"At this rate, I'll have to keep waiting until that young master finishes his training plan. When that happens, I would've wasted all my time waiting! What should I do?\" Luo Feng quickly started thinking, since he hasn't even had a single chance to take action.Is he just going to wait like this?\"There are no chances\"Luo Feng's eyes flashed and he clenched his teeth, \"Since there aren't any chances, then I can make them!\"\"Aren't they always together? I'll force them to separate!\" Luo Feng lightly tightened the cap on the water sack.......Around three hours later, the seven members of the thunderbolt squad carefully treaded forward in the old den of the monsters. Sometimes they move forward, sometimes they walk around, and finally they arrived at the six story residential apartment from before.\"Time to act!\"Luo Feng, who was fully equipped, slightly smiled as he left his room and ran down the stairs like a swift monkey. Even Luo Feng can't be too cocky after leaving this 18 story residential building, so he carefully moved forward while searching the area.Avoiding monsters is hard, but finding them is easy!15 minutes later, Luo Feng arrived at a dog-type monster horde that had around two to three thousand monsters. This dog-type monster horde was staying in a gigantic factory that manufactured home appliances. Usually, no human fighter would even try to challenge such a horde, since the threat of two to three thousand monsters is too great.\"Roar~~\"The roars of the large monsters echoed around the factory and the smell of urine emanated around the area.\"Heh, what a strong monster horde\" Luo Feng looked through the cap of the wall, \"Let's begin!\".Soon after--\"Roar~\"\"Roar Roar Roar~~\"The monsters in the factory howled madly. The death of a few dozen monsters caused this huge monster horde to become enraged, because they have never suffered such shame before. Even the leader of the monster horde and two high leveled commander level lion mastiffs started howling. The entire monster horde crazily chased after.\"They sure run fast!\"The hexagonal shield on Luo Feng's back was under effects of the powerful force of his spiritual force; in an instant, Luo Feng became a flying hurricane.RUMBLE~~Some tiger mastiffs were mixed into the lion mastiff horde. The tiger mastiffs ran just as quickly as the lion mastiffs as they chased after Luo Feng. The ones in the front of the horde were sprinting at a rate of 70 to 80 m/s! Under such astonishing speed, it would take only 30 seconds for them to cover the 4 miles between the factory and the six story residential building!Just 30 seconds!And Luo Feng ran towards the six story residential building like lightning.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIn one of the suite rooms on the sixth floor of the six story residential apartment, the seven members of thunderbolt squad were resting. Actually, when the entire monster horde was howling as they chased after Luo Feng, the seven members of the thunderbolt squad weren't alerted at all.... because what kind of place in the city doesn't have a monster howling in a four mile radius?But after around 10 seconds.\"Seems like a battle has occurred to our east\" laughed the one eyed middle aged man.\"Who cares, there's always a fight going on between fighters and monster hordes here in #003 city. This time, a fighter probably enraged some monster horde\" the tiger fang captain, Pan Ya, was completely calm. Since he has dozens of years of experience as a fighter, he has seen this type of scenario way too many times.But in the time that these words were passed around.\"The monster horde seems to be really close to us now!\"\"Even the building is shaking a bit\"Within an instant, the seven members of the thunderbolt squad rushed towards the northern window and looked down, and saw that there were large amounts of mastiff monsters near the entrance to the staircase of the six story residential apartment. Some of the lion mastiff monsters were even charging into the staircase. In just these few seconds, the entire residential apartment started shaking, like an earthquake was occurring. The roars of many monsters also echoed around.\"BOOM!\" The door to the room where the seven members of the thunderbolt squad were in was blasted open.The lion mastiffs with their SUV sized bodies charged in the room one by one. Not only was the door directly smashed into smithereens, but even the walls were startling to crumble. The over a thousand monsters were continuously smashing the residential building up. It seemed like the building could fall down at any moment.And outside of the residential building were around one to two thousand more lion mastiff monsters. These lion mastiff monsters can't even enter the building, so they just surrounded the residential apartment completely. If you can imagine a scene where one to two thousand SUVs are surrounding a building, then you can imagine how scary it'll be for so many monsters to surround a residential apartment.\"WHAT'S GOING ON!!!\" the mixed youth immediately started screaming as his face turned pale.Anyone would panic after witnessing the apartment building that has shook so much that it's on the verge of collapse, the large amounts of monsters pouring into the room, and the densely packed horde of monsters surrounding the residential apartment building below.\"Protect the young master! Tiger fang squad, protect the rear!\" roared the old veteran named Liu.\"DADADADA~~~\"Dong Zi's machine gun was crazily roaring and the bullet shells crazily flew around. The powerful bullets shot into the bodies of the lion mastiff monsters one by one. The monsters were charging so quickly that even when they were hit by the bullets, they would continue charging forwards. The bald brute, the one eyed man, and the tiger fang captain Pan Ya relied on their cold weapons to smash the monsters to the side one by one.\"PENG!\" \"PENG!\" \"PENG!\"The old veteran named Liu and the white brute already brought the mixed youth along with them as they directly jumped out the window.\"Let's go!\" The tiger fang captain roared and was the first to follow as he jumped from the window.\"Dong Zi, hurry!\" roared the one eyed man.When comparing physical fitness, gunners are the weakest. The gunner, Dong Zi, also clenched his teeth as he jumped out the window. Finally, the one eyed middle aged man and the bald brute also jumped out the window. Even if a beginner level warlord fighter is carrying several hundred kg of things on him, they wouldn't suffer any injury from jumping from a height of six stories.However, the thing awaiting them below isn't a flat ground, but over a thousand monsters!......The walls of the second floor of the residential apartment were already smashed into pieces. And Luo Feng was hiding in the corner of a room on the second floor!When Luo Feng rushed into this room, he used his spiritual force to control the concrete walls, the stone tables, etc. to completely seal the bathroom he is in, and he even broke the ceiling. After the concrete fell down, the room was completely ruined, so even after the monsters charged in, they wouldn't be able to find Luo Feng.After that, the monster horde spotted the thunderbolt squad on the sixth floor and directed all their attention onto them.Standing beside the bathroom's window, Luo Feng stared outside and his ears were listening closely.\"They're fighting!\" Luo Feng heard a few faint roars from the sixth floor.After that, three shadows quickly fell from above.\"They jumped\" Luo Feng's eyes flashed and two black throwing knives immediately hovered beside him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Closely following them was the captain of the tiger fang squad, 'Pan Ya'.\"HOWL~~\"\"Protect the young master, charge out!\" right when the old veteran named Liu landed, his legs smashed onto two nearby lion mastiff monsters like two war axes. The two lion mastiff monsters howled in pain as they flew away and smashed into seven or eight nearby lion mastiff lion and tigers, causing chaos in the area for a moment.The white brute had a gigantic two handed sword in hand as he crazily charged forward! The tiger captain, 'Pan Ya', supported the white brute beside him.One of them had unrivaled strength while the other was sinister and unpredictable. The two of them combined were like a bulldozer, sweeping away the monsters in front of them.\"HOWL~~\"A low, thunder-like sound started rumbling. Not too far away, a huge body that was around four to five meters tall and even larger than an average truck appeared. It's whole body was silver and was even slightly reflecting light, since there were some silver scales on it's fur. There was a small bump on it's huge forehead, as if it was going to break it's fur open.This is one of the two high level commander level monsters in the whole horde!A high level commander lion mastiff!\"BOOM!\" With just a leap, the commander lion mastiff flew a distance of 20 meters like a silver light and shot straight towards the thunderbolt squad.\"Pan Ya, you protect the young master and hurry up and run\" roared the old veteran named Liu. With a blade in hand, he howled, \"KA LONG!\".\"UNDERSTOOD!\" The white brute also roared.The old veteran named Liu and the white brute engaged the commander lion mastiff at virtually the same time. There was no helping it; if they didn't engage it..... then the mixed youth would be in grave danger. \"HOWL~~\" The commander lion mastiff roared and it's body started to blur a bit as it's claws headed straight towards the two humans in front of it.\"QIANG!\"\"KUANG!\"\"BOOM!\" The clash between the two advanced level warlords and the high level commander level monster caused chaos. The surrounding lion mastiffs were caught in and blown away. Even the surrounding walls and the floor was affected and messed up. With large amounts of lion mastiff monsters supporting, the commander lion mastiff was practically even with the veteran named Liu and the white brute.PENG! PENG! PENG!The gunner Dong Zi, the bald brute, and the one eyed middle aged man also jumped out at this time.However, the one eyed middle aged man, the bald brute, and the gunner Dong Zi were all panicking. The group of the old veteran named Liu, the white brute, the mixed youth, and Pan Ya were able to mess around in the monster horde, but the one eyed middle aged man and the others were clearly having a hard time.\"Hurry, let's go\" said the one eyed middle aged man.\"Hurry!\"\"DADADADA~~\" Dong Zi dragged his machine gun along as he freely fired at the surrounding monsters.At this time--\"HOWL~~\"After the heart shuddering howl, another huge body that was also completely silver came jumping down from the six story apartment. Suddenly, the lion mastiff leader that was fighting against the old veteran named Liu and the white brute immediately started roaring excitedly as it conversed with the huge shadow coming from above.Another lion mastiff leader! Also a high level commander!The faces of the old veteran named Liu and the white brute changed drastically. They glanced at the tiger fang captain 'Pan Ya' and the mixed youth who were already far away..... when the two of them were stalling the large amounts of monsters, Pan Ya and the mixed youth were able to get away.\"Hurry, go!\"\"Go\"The white brute and the old veteran named Liu didn't dare to delay at all. Even without the monster horde, they couldn't go head to head with two high level commander monsters..... and there's a gigantic monster horde surrounding them!\"HOWL~\" \"HOWL~\"The two high level commander level lion mastiff leaders roared as they charged; would they allow these two damned humans to get away?......On the second floor of the ruined six story residential apartment, Luo Feng watched what was going on outside through the window silently. The white brute and the old veteran named Liu ran away while the one eyed middle aged man, the bald brute, and Dong Zi were still bitterly charging out, Luo Feng let out a smile on his face.\"Now's the time!\"Two black throwing knives instantly flew out from the window towards the one eyed middle aged man and the bald brute in the horde of the lion mastiff monsters.It's better like this!If he fought out in the open, then the one eyed middle aged man who has reached the intermediate warlord level could put up a bit of a fight, but under this ambush.....\"PU!\" \"PU!\"The brains of the one eyed middle aged man and the bald brute were instantly pierced and blew up like watermelons. Soon after, the two eerie black lights virtually instantly pierced through the head of the gunner Dong Zi, who was currently crazily shooting his machine gun! When the three of them died, they were filled with fear, question, and dissatisfaction.They didn't even know what killed them.\"RUMBLE~~\" the three human corpses were instantly charged at by the large amounts of monsters. The lion mastiff and tiger mastiff monsters excitedly ripped apart their flesh.In the bathroom on the second floor, Luo Feng quietly watched the two lion mastiff leaders charge after the old veteran named Liu and the white brute.\"Out of the six members of the tiger fang squad, five of them are already dead!\"\"Good, all according to plan. Even though I was the one behind this, they're clueless\" Luo Feng was satisfied with what he has done so far, since he doesn't want to hurt that mixed youth. As long as you aren't dumb, you can figure out that..... the power behind the mixed youth is great!So--Luo Feng didn't attack the members of the tiger fang squad when they were with the young master!However, because of the monster horde's attack, the seven members of the squad split into three. Running in front was the mixed youth and Pan Ya, being chased by the two high level commander monsters was the old veteran named Liu and the white brute, while the last section was the one eyed middle aged man and the others!Because the mixed youth, the old veteran named Liu, and the white brute have ran far away already, they couldn't see what was going on with the one eyed middle aged man and the others at all, which was why Luo Feng chose that time to strike!\"However, the young master is probably in big trouble this time\" Luo Feng thought to himself.However, suddenly--A blurry shadow of a human appeared in Luo Feng's field of vision. This human was carrying some type of staff-type weapon. With a flash, he covered a few hundred meters and charged straight into the monster horde.\"RUMBLE~~\"A shocking blasting sound carried out, and the dozens of lion mastiffs and tiger mastiffs around Pan Ya and the mixed youth instantly turned into piles of flesh. The speed that surpassed the speed of sound caused the blasting sound.The shadow moved again!It directly arrived in front of the two lion mastiff leaders. The two lion mastiff leaders immediately let out an astonished howl and, surprisingly, started to run away!\"BOOM!\"The staff-type weapon harshly smashed onto the body of one of the lion mastiff leaders like lightning. The silver lion mastiff leader was launched up by around twenty meters, and all the scales on its body completely split open. Fresh blood sprayed around in the air, and while this lion mastiff was launched up by around twenty meters--\"BOOM!\"The shadow instantly chased after the other lion mastiff leader and also gave it a ferocious smash!The lion mastiff leader was like a thrown bowling ball as it was launched away and then smashed into the large amounts of lion mastiffs and tiger mastiffs behind it. The lion mastiffs that were near were directly shocked to death, while the other large amounts of lion mastiffs and tiger mastiffs were smashed away.As for the high level commander level lion mastiff leader, it rolled on the ground a few times and then stopped moving completely. Large amounts of blood came pouring from it's nose and ears.\"BOOM!\" And at this time, the lion mastiff leader that was launched high up into the air came crashing down onto the ground, not moving an inch.In an instant!Two high level commander level monsters instantly dead!\"AO WU~\" All the lion mastiffs, tiger mastiffs, and some other low level commander level monsters were completely shocked. All of them wailed as they all started running away.Only at this time did the shadow start to take up more of a form..Luo Feng just saw what the guy looked like: a huge brute that was around 2.3 to 2.4 meters tall and a face that looked like it was sculpted. He wore a completely gray battle uniform and held a gigantic..... mace! One can't help but to shiver after seeing the spikes on that mace!\"Too messed up\"Luo Feng looked at the two lifeless lion mastiff leaders' corpses and was completely stunned. He was so shocked that he didn't even dare to breathe loudly, \"This is a wargod level fighter! It must be! I should be careful. If he finds me here, then there'll be trouble\".Even the throwing knives that were originally shot out, under Luo Feng's will, dug into the ground. Luo Feng was too scared to retrieve them.\"Uncle Li!\" The mixed youth came running over and thanked him repeatedly.\"Mr. Lee\"The old veteran named Liu and the white brute respectfully bowed.The large brute laughed as he looked at the mixed youth: \"Li Wei, when your dad received your SOS signal and found your location, there were two wargods nearby: me and brother Wang. He quickly contacted me first. Luckily, I wasn't too far away..... so I could make it in time\".\"Uncle Wang is here too?\" the eyes of the mixed youth flashed with light.At this time.....As if a wind blew past, a blurry shadow appeared in the vicinity. After stabilizing, a handsome person who seemed to be around 20 to 30 years old wearing a blue battle uniform appeared.\"Uncle Wang\" The mixed youth yelled.\"Look at your shameful self\" said the man as he slightly laughed.The white brute and the old veteran named Liu didn't dare to make a sound on the side, while the tiger fang captain Pan Ya was looking around the area. When he saw that there were some battle uniforms, remains from corpses, and a machine gun lying on the ground, his eyes couldn't help but to turn red.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he looked at the bloody remains, the tiger captain bitterly clenched his fists.\"Pan Ya, they're already dead. What's the point in being sad?\" lowly shouted the veteran named Liu.\"Oh, what's going on?\"The man named Wang smiled as he looked over and the mixed youth immediately laughed as he explained: \"Uncle Wang, it's like this. My dad let me come out here to get some combat experience. Not only is old Liu and Ka Long protecting me, but a warlord level fighter squad was also hired to protect me, in case we need more people. However, five out of the six members of their squad died, so he's the only one left\".\"Six of them, and five of them died?\"A deep voice carried out from the throat of the huge brute, \"Isn't this squad just too weak!\"\"Mr. Li\" said the veteran named Liu respectfully, \"It's actually not because the tiger fang squad is too weak. Truthfully, in the past few days when we left to give our young master some combat experience, the two squad members guarding our point encountered an attack by monsters and died right there! And this time, when we were resting on the sixth floor, we were also mysteriously attacked by a gigantic monster horde.... those three were weaker, so they died in the monster horde\".The man named Wang slightly frowned.The huge brute also said in a confused tone: \"What's going on?\".It's very rare for a monster horde to attack a location where the fighters are hiding. And since this happened twice in a row, there's clearly something wrong!\"Someone's causing this behind your backs\"said the man named Wang silently, \"It's probably someone who has a grudge against the tiger fang squad!\".Luo Feng was hiding in a bathroom on the second floor of a residential apartment building. His breathing was already as weak as it could get, but Luo Feng, who didn't dare to make a sound, couldn't help but to be surprised after clearly hearing what that man named Wang said: \"This guy sure hit the mark!\".\"Someone with a grudge against the tiger fang squad?\" Pan Ya walked over here.\"Uncle Wang?\" The mixed youth also had a confused look on his face as he looked towards the man named Wang.\"Even though your dad has enemies, all of them are wargods! A wargod wouldn't bother to come and kill a child like you. If that happens, then your dad will surely go mad and eradicate that person's entire family\" the man named Wang smiled as he said, \"And also, if a wargod wanted to kill you, you would be dead within your first day of leaving the headquarter city\".The mixed youth nodded.\"Your dad did the right thing. Li Wei, the training you're undergoing is the best of the best. However, your current fighting strength is quite average\". The man named Wang asked, \"How's your fitness level now?\".\"My fitness level counts as an intermediate warlord. However..... I can only fight against most 'low level commander level monsters'\" answered the mixed youth.\"Average! Very average! Or you could say..... below average!\".The man named Wang said in a dissatisfied tone, \"Man's intelligence is higher than monsters'! A horde leader's intelligence is only roughly equal to a human's! So..... a true fighter should be able to fight against a monster that's the same level as him. A few messed up fighters can even fight against monsters above their level! Your fitness level is that of a intermediate warlord's, and yet you can only fight against a beginner level commander? You still lack lots of training!\"The mixed youth earnestly nodded his head.\"Your fitness level is good, which is why your mom and dad bothered to spend tons of money on you!\" said the man named Wang seriously, \"With your talent, and your parents' support, there's a chance for you to step into the 'wargod level' within 10 years! So right now, you should seriously absorb some real battle experience! Only when you become a wargod and enter the 'Palace of Wargods' will people start to respect you and not treat you like a weak, spoiled child of a powerful man\".\"Understood, uncle Wang\" the mixed youth clenched his teeth as he nodded.His father is a first generation fighter, and his mother is one of the powerful wargod fighters in one of the super families in the European Union. With his parent's genes, Li Wei is very talented. Even without entering the wilderness, after around twenty years, his fitness level has reached the intermediate warlord level!If his dad and mom spend large amounts of money, then it won't be hard for Li Wei to step into the 'wargod' level.\"Dare to ask you senior, what is the Palace of Wargods?\" the tiger captain 'Pan Ya' who didn't make a sound until now couldn't help but to ask.Even the hiding Luo Feng couldn't help but to pay attention, yeah, what exactly is the Palace of Wargods?\"Usually, people will only get contacted when they reach the \"advanced warlord level\"\" the man named Wang glanced at him, \"Your skill is pretty good, so it's alright if I tell you in advance! The Palace of Wargods is a group formed by not only all the wargod level fighters, but also all the existences that surpass the wargod level in every headquarter city in all the five major countries on earth!\".\"You can say that all the wargods on the entire earth are part of the Palace of Wargods!\".\"And the strongest fighter 'Hong' and 'Thunder God' are the creators of the Palace of Wargods! It's a power made for us fighters\" smiled the man named Wang.The tiger captain Pan Ya was flabbergasted.Even Luo Feng, who was hiding far away, was surprised. Holy shit, all the human wargods on earth forming one power together? And 'Hong' and 'Thunder God' partnered up to create that group? Once this power is established, not even those powerful countries can do anything about it!\"The Palace of Wargods is the palace for fighters\"\"The Palace of Wargods is the final fort for humanities battle against monsters!\"\"The Palace of Wargods exist for two reasons. One, to chase our limits as humans. Two, to eradicate the monsters on earth!\".Said the man named Wang as his eyes slightly flashed.The blood of all the people at the scene were boiling, including the old veteran named Liu. He was excited, because he is at the advanced warlord level. Even though he's just one step away, due to his age, it will probably be hard for him to get any stronger. Even Luo Feng, who was hiding far away, was excited.\"Alright, Li Wei, you guys should hurry up and leave\".The man named Wang smiled, \"Me and your uncle Li have to get ready to go and fight that 'high level horde leader level' steel armored dragon. This operation is very dangerous, so you should get far away from here. It'll be better if you guys at least get to the highway outside the sector\".\"Steel armored dragon?\" the mixed youth's eyes were wide open.Pan Ya, the old veteran named Liu, and the white brute all took in a deep breath.\"Holy shit\" Luo Feng, who was hiding far away, was also surprised, \"These two wargods sure are brave. A high level horde leader level steel armored dragon!\". A horde leader's intelligence is roughly equal to a human's. And naturally, the fitness level of this horde leader monster is higher than a human of the same level!So, against a high level horde leader monster, usually even an advanced level wargod has to run.Two wargods teaming against a high level horde leader?Are they out of their minds?\"Haha, that steel armored dragon just laid eggs recently, so it lost lots of its strength\" smiled the man named Wang, \"This is the best chance!\".\"Laid eggs?\" the mixed youth and the others were surprised.\"Alright, hurry and leave. That steel armored dragon is only 10 miles away from here. Once we take action, the large monster horde under it's control will start moving..... and the surrounding area will get affected. So it's safer for you guys to leave Shanghai city and run to the highway\" explained the man named Wang.All the horde leaders are intelligent, and will have a huge monster horde under it's control.\"Okay, understood\" nodded the mixed youth, \"Then your nephew wishes uncle Li and uncle Wang good luck\".\"Let's go\"After the mixed youth's command, Pan Ya and the others immediately swiftly left. They wouldn't dare not listen to a wargod's warning, so they all immediately ran outside the city.On the way.The mixed youth and the other three were completely astonished.\"Mr. Wang and Mr. Li sure are strong. Hunting a high level horde leader! Even if it's weaker after laying eggs, it's still a high level horde leader\" the old veteran named Liu couldn't help but to say.\"Are these two people the legendary shadow blade brothers 'Shadow Blade' Wang Tong and 'Bear Strength' Li Kan?\" Pan Ya couldn't help but to ask.\"Correct\"The mixed youth proudly smiled, \"When my dad and mom were young, they were in the same squad as uncle Wang and uncle Li. That's a friendship to the death!\"The tiger captain Pan Ya couldn't help but to be amazed.This is the background! His parents are wargods, so naturally, his parents have quite a few wargod friends too!\"One day, I'm also going to become a wargod and join the Palace of Wargods! Once I join the Palace of Wargods, I'll easily be able to make connections with other wargods..... at that time, I'll also have my own gigantic network of wargods!\" Pan Ya couldn't help but to look forward to, \"Yup, since I'm the only person left in the tiger fang squad, I'll go search for a more powerful fighter squad to join!\".And Luo Feng hid there without moving a hair.Voices carried from outside.\"Are you done dissecting? Let's go and prepare first. Our opponent this time is a steel armored dragon! If it was a high level 'SIlver Moon Wolf' or 'Black Cloud Tiger', then that'll be easy to deal with! But a steel armored dragon's speed, defense, power, and toughness are all too extreme. Now that it laid eggs, this is our best chance to strike\" after listening to this sound, it's clear that this is the voice of the man named Wang.And the huge brute's deep voice rang: \"Got it, brother Wang\".\"Alright, depart!\"A slight sound of wind could be heard for a moment, and then nothing more.Luo Feng looked through the window and saw the area outside. The two of them were already no where to be seen.\"That Pan Ya got lucky this time. Looks like I won't be able to kill him this time\" Luo Feng was clear that, once the mixed youth and the others leave the #003 city sector, this time's hunt is over, \"Yup, can't risk it! Well, it'll just have to wait until the next time I encounter him in the wilderness\".A flash of curiosity then appeared in Luo Feng's eyes: \"Two wargods hunting a high level horde leader steel armored dragon after it's been weakened after laying eggs? And it's 10 miles away?\"\"I must watch this battle\"Luo Feng's heart itched. If he doesn't watch such an amazing battle, then he'll surely regret it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And Luo Feng suddenly bursted out from the second floor of that residential apartment and the two throwing knives in the ground immediately flew back into Luo Feng's thigh pockets.\"Two wargods will, not long from now, fight against that high level horde leader steel armored dragon. I should hurry and get to a good spectating spot!\" Luo Feng glanced at the largest corpses, which were the two commander lion mastiffs, and shook his head as he sighed, \"The wargods sure dissected these two corpses cleanly. The two most important materials were taken away\".Originally, Luo Feng wanted to get some benefits for himself.Luo Feng became a blurry shadow and swiftly headed south.\"The steel armored dragon's nest is 10 miles away from here, which is that family mart..... then I'll pick a residential apartment three miles away from there\" Luo Feng made his decision while he sprinted. In this monster infested city made out of concrete and steel, even a spirit reader can't let his guard down.Sometimes he would sprint, and sometimes he would slow down to check around.Overall, he was still pretty fast. 10 minutes later, Luo Feng entered the 16th floor of a 18 story residential apartment building!\"PUCHI~~\"Two eerie black lights rotated as they landed into his thigh pockets. Luo Feng smiled as he lightly opened the door to a room on the 16th floor. The room was sealed shut, but the formless spiritual force easily opened the lock, causing the huge door to open.\"The door to this room was locked and wasn't destroyed. Looks like no fighter or monster came in here before in the past 30 to 40 years from the Grand Nirvana period until the present\" Luo Feng entered and closed the door behind him. Indeed, all the objects in the room were orderly placed.A glass cabinet, a sofa, a marble table, and a 24 inch T.V.All of these things are the style from before the Grand Nirvana period.\"Hu!\"Luo Feng took off the wool blanket that was on the sofa, since the skin of the sofa itself was cleaner. He took that blanket and immediately ran to the balcony and wiped the glass on the balcony, and then opened the glass window.\"What nice scenery\"\"I'll stand here and try to take a good look at the monster nest ahead\" Luo Feng threw the blanket aside and leaned on the railing as he looked at the area three miles away from his position. He only saw smoke, which completely covered the family mart that acted as the nest for the monsters. The naked eye couldn't see past the smoke at all.However, with the daylight sun shining down, the naked eye could see much more clearly than usual.With his binoculars in hand, Luo Feng closely looked towards the area with smoke. At the smoke's border, large pig-type monsters could be seen. Some of them were laying on the ground, some of them were walking around, and some of them even seemed to be competing against each other as they rammed into each other over and over again.\"There's no commotion at all. Where are those two wargods?\" Luo Feng tried his best to observe the area, but he couldn't find the traces of those two wargods at all.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdWhile Luo Feng was searching for the two wargods, in the room on the 12th floor of a residential apartment that was at a distance of around 500 meters away from Luo Feng, Wang Tong and the huge brute Li Kan sat cross legged as they drank some water, replenishing the water in their bodies.\"Kan\" the young, handsome looking Wang Tong lightly sipped a bit of water, \"When we directly barge into the nucleus of that monster nest and directly go against that steel armored dragon..... of course, it's two underlings, the two 'low level horde leader flame scale triple halberd boars' will definitely come to its aid. At that time, I'll leave those two flame scale triple halberd boars to you, Kan\".\"Okay\" answered the huge brute Li Kan in a low voice. He lightly waved his mace, as if it was as easy as waving a match.\"Flame scale triple halberd boar, rank 1 out of the pig-type monsters! Not good to mess with at all. Your mission is just to stall them, no need to kill them\" seriously reminded the young, handsome Wang Tong.A steel armored dragon and two flame scale triple halberd boars!With this kind of combination, they absolutely have the authority to rule over the entire #003 city sector. If it wasn't for the fact that the powerful steel armored dragon just laid eggs causing it to dramatically decrease in power, Wang Tong wouldn't dare to charge in.\"Brother Li, I'm ready\" the huge brute Li Kan stood up.\"Okay\"Wang Tong also stood up and coldly watched the smoke covered area far away, \"Go, let's depart!\"Whoosh! Whoosh!Two human shadows directly jumped off of the 12th floor, and as if they were human-sized grasshoppers, directly crossed a distance of 100 meters, landing on another building. Using that building as a boost, the two of them immediately flew into the forest of steel and concrete..... and the speed of both of them has long surpassed the speed of sound!BOOM~~When Luo Feng heard that sonic boom, he turned his head around..... and only saw two blurry images enter the smoke covered area.\"They already went in? So fast!\" Luo Feng didn't dare to be careless and closely stared at the smoke covered area.\"HOWL~\"\"ROAR~~~\"Enraged howls immediately rang from the smoke covered area, as if the entire world was coming to an end. And the huge amounts of monsters outside of the smoke covered area also immediately sprinted into the area, causing the earth to shake for a moment!\"They started fighting?\" Luo Feng could only stare at the smoke and guess, since he couldn't see what was going on inside at all......The family mart that was full of dust and had quite a bit of blood stains had no signs of human life, for this has already become the playground for monsters.\"HOWL HOWL~~\"A huge being that was covered in deep green scales was currently in deep sleep as it lay in the family mart. Two bloody smelling smoke currents blew out of its nose, emanating around the area. The first and second floor of the entire supermarket had long been destroyed, causing the entire supermarket to be quite spacious. Just the first floor alone was around seven to eight meters tall.Suddenly, the enraged howls of monsters carried from outside.\"HOWL~\" This huge being slowly crawled up, it's flaming red eyes could scare any human away.This is a being that is five meters tall and around 10 meters long. And it's tail is also an astonishing 10 meters long! It's body seemed to be narrow and long, and there was one curved black horn on it's forehead. When it stood up, a green egg that was around one meter tall appeared under it.With just a movement from this green scaled beast, it disappeared from the supermarket......This family mart supermarket is the nucleus of the monster horde! There was a sea of monsters surrounding it.Whoosh! Whoosh!The two human shadows were as fast as lightning, speedily jumping on the bodies of the monsters as they charged towards that family mart supermarket.\"Hurry! Don't fight or you might get held back by this monster horde\" shouted Wang Tong.\"Understood\" Li Kan was trying hard to hold back his tyrannical temper.In front of the door to the family mart was a huge 'Bloodthirsty Tank' monster, and there were also horned boars there too. The scales of each of these monsters were much shinier, and also seemed to be much more intricate, than a regular monsters'. There seemed to be some intelligence in the eyes of these huge monsters.Indeed......All these huge monsters, surpassing the count of a hundred, were all commander level monsters! This is the nucleus of the entire horrifying monster horde!In front of the horde made out of over a hundred commander level monsters were two huge monsters that seemed to be on fire, causing one's heart to skip a beat. The bodies of these two monsters were full of flaming red scales, not a single other color! Their large heads especially stood out, having three huge curved horns pointing forwards!Flame scale triple halberd boars! The race ranked one out of the pig-type monsters! Even the weakest flame scaled triple halberd boars were medium level commanders. And these two were low level horde leaders!\"HOWL~~\" a roar that shook the skies then followed.A blurry image appeared in front of the two flame scaled triple halberd boars. After the image cleared up, it turned into a body that was just a bit shorter than the flame scale triple halberd boars, a body that was full of deep green scales. Two smoke currents angrily shot out of its nostrils, and its eyes were staring at the two humans coming to kill it.\"Scum, die!\" Wang Tong roared as huge amounts of monsters charged at him, but Wang Tong brought a rain of blood along with him as large amounts of monster corpses came flying from the sky.The steel armored dragon felt like the two humans in front of him were powerful, and it turned back and looked inside the interior of the supermarket, it's dragon egg was still there......If they battle here!The battle between an advanced level wargod and a high level horde leader, if the dragon egg gets affected, it'll easily break!\"HOWL~~\" The steel armored dragon let out a deep roar and suddenly flew outside. When it sprinted, it even caused a sonic boom.\"I knew this would happen!\"Wang Tong and Li Kan were extremely happy as they saw this. They have guessed long ago..... that because of the dragon egg that the steel armored dragon laid, it would probably give up on fighting in the old nest. This way, without being restricted by huge amounts of monsters, the chances of Wang Tong and Li Kan's victory will increase by quite a bit.\"BOOM!\" \"BOOM!\"Wang Tong and Li Kan also instantly reached the speed of sound as they chased after it.\"BOOM!\" \"BOOM!\" The two low level horde leader flame scaled triple halberd boars too reached the speed of sound as they chased after.As for the commander level monsters, only around 30 of them chased after. The other elite commander level monsters were guarding the area, protecting their leaders' nest. Out of these 100 commander level monsters, there were around 30 high level commander level monsters. With such a team......Even a wargod can't instantly charge inside......On the high building, Luo Feng was standing on the balcony as he watched with his binoculars. He saw an image, two images, and then two more images all connected as they charged out of the smoke covered area.\"Haha, they actually came out to battle\" Luo Feng's eyes flashed, \"Hmhm, they're all horde leader and wargod level!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The pig-type monsters have many categories, the dog-type monsters have many categories, cat-type monsters, rat-type monsters, gecko-type monsters, wolf-type, tiger-type, snake-type, eagle-type, bear-type.....Each type has quite the number of species!Other than these, there are some extremely special and rare monsters. No one knows how they came to be or what they evolved from. They were probably monsters that were born under extremely special conditions! These monsters will have some unique names, according to their strength...... humanity will bestow upon them different names.Steel armored dragon! This is one of the special dragon species!Because it's speed, power, defense, knowledge, body structure, etc. are almost perfect, the humans have called it the 'steel armored dragon', giving it the title of 'dragon'. To be able to receive such a name, one can imagine how powerful and horrifying the steel armored dragon is!\"HOWL~~\" The steel armored dragon's tail, which was practically longer than it's body, was swiftly waving around, causing a dark green, hazy image to appear.The steel armored dragon's body was crazily headed towards 'Shadow Blade' Wang Tong.\"PU!\" Because of the steel armored dragon's attack, the asphalt sidewalk directly split open.\"RUMBLE~~\"Wang Tong and the steel armored dragon, one human and one monsters, first rammed into one of the residential apartments. The concrete wall of that residential apartment, like tofu, split open. With a brutal sweep from the steel armored dragon's tail, all the walls and pillars of the building came tumbling down.RUMBLE~~ The entire residential building fell, causing dust to fill the sky.Hu~ Hu~Wang Tong's body was like a wave of soft wind, each of his lightning-fast movements had the taste of wind in them. The rhythm was clearly free. Even though the steel armored dragon's attack was astonishingly quick and strong enough to cause a shocking shockwave, none of them were able to injure Wang Tong at all. And some of the scales of this steel armored dragon split into two.\"Who would've known that even after laying eggs, this steel armored dragon is still this powerful\" Wang Tong was extremely anxious, \"Since I'm a human, my body can't take as much of an impact as this steel armored dragon can\".\"The saying goes that if you always defend, you're sure to lose. I can dodge to the side for a time, but I can't continue this forever\".\"However, with it's defensive capabilities, unless I hit it's weak spot, just one or two broken scales wouldn't affect it at all\" Wang Tong frowned, \"No chances, looks like I have to risk it and make my own chances\"......\"Too messed up\"Luo Feng, who was spectating on the balcony of a tall building from far away, couldn't contain his excitement as he watched the two wargods, Wang Tong and Li Kan, battle against the three commander level monsters. All the concrete sidewalks, asphalt roads, commercial buildings, and even buildings that were over 10 stories tall that got in their way could only split open or fall. None of them could block their battle. And a falling building that's over 10 stories tall couldn't even hurt a hair on their bodies!\"It is said that the bodies of horde leader level monsters are even tougher than diamond and that even guided missiles can't harm them! Looks like they weren't lying!\"When the buildings that were over 10 stories high fell, even if some of them smashed against the steel armored dragon, a shake of the steel armored dragon's tail was enough to directly smash apart the falling concrete, exposing the reinforced steel within. After throwing them up, the scales of the steel armored dragon weren't even scathed at all.Easy and relaxed, the speed of the horde leader monster and the human wargod's movements all surpassed the speed of sound!\"Well, this is a high level horde leader monster and not a normal one, but a 'steel armored dragon'. This is way more powerful than the black-crowned golden eagle that I saw on T.V a while ago\" as Luo Feng watched, his blood boiled, \"Sadly, the exchange of blows between the them are just too fast, I can't even see them clearly\". Luo Feng could only see the terrifying destructive power caused by the fight between both sides.\"HOWL~~\"\"ROAR~~\"Along with the monstrous, enraged roars came over ten million monsters under the lead of around 30 commander level monsters that covered the entire ground as they came charging. For a time, the entire ground was shaking. The two flame scaled triple halberd boars that were currently cooperating as they fought against the huge brute, Li Kan, immediately let out some excited, sky-shaking roars......\"That huge brute named Li sure is strong\" Luo Feng was spectating from the balcony and looked at the scene below that seemed like the world was ending, \"That mace is powerful and his dodging is extremely quick, it's absolutely the 'Ru Wei class' dodging technique, and he's very experienced with it. He's able to use the every single part of the surroundings. He's even able to use the monsters charging at him. This control over the battlefield is way above me\".Luo Feng critiqued and at the same time, absorbed experience.Even though he's also Ru Wei class, he still isn't able to perfectly use every part of the surrounding area to assist him in a battle to the death.\"And that guy named Wang is even stronger\"Luo Feng's amazement showed through his eyes, \"His technique, not only does it far surpass the 'Ru Wei class', but it also surpasses the huge brute named Li's ability to 'control the surrounding'... it has reached a natural level with it's own will. His body is just like the wind. For technique, he's definitely a master!\".Even though Luo Feng's technique is superb, there's still an obvious difference when compared to these two wargods.Actually...... Luo Feng didn't know exactly who these two were.Shadow blade 'Wang Tong', an advanced wargod that is famous around the world! His best partner, 'Bear Strength' Li Kan, is an intermediate wargod whose speciality lies within his strength. His strength could be compared to an advanced level wargod's.These two people have gone through huge amounts of battles to the death and are the absolute elite of this world, so they have huge amounts of experience.Which is why their technique was so superb.\"The man named Wang is injured\"\"No wait, it was a trick. The steel armored dragon's head is injured now\" Luo Feng's eyes were wide open as he observed through the binoculars in hand.\"****, the entire monster horde is enraged, even those two flame scaled triple halberd boars are enraged too\"\"Wait, even though that steel armored dragon is heavily injured, it's even more enraged than before. That man named Wang is trying his best to dodge out of the way\".Luo Feng was extremely excited, \"Oh yea, that man named Wang is trying to avoid this steel armored dragon's spirit! This wargod sure is cruel, and his blade sure is fast!\". Luo Feng realized that the man named Wang desperately tried to control the rhythm of the battle, but even though the steel armored dragon has been weakened from laying an egg, it's body structure was still way above this Wang Tong.\"Rhythm, yes, control the rhythm of the battle\"\"If this goes on, then maybe the man named Wang can actually kill that steel armored dragon. Hmhm, at that time, maybe they'll even get the steel armored dragon's dragon egg. An egg that can give birth to the unique species 'Steel armored dragon', that sure is worth a lot\".Suddenly, Luo Feng's eyes flashed.....Dragon egg!\"Steel armored dragon, the two flame scaled triple halberd boars, these three horde leaders have all come out. The two wargods are here too! Which also means..... since there's no horde leader monster at the monster nest, I would have a chance to enter the nest and steal the dragon egg?\" Luo Feng could only hear his heart go 'THUMP' 'THUMP', as if it was about to burst out his chest.His heartbeat was like the beat of a drum!Excitement, nervousness!Luo Feng wasn't planning to steal the dragon egg before. He thought that once the two wargods head over there, they'll be fighting against the three horde leader level monsters at the old nest. If that happens..... then if he goes, he'll just be flying towards his death. However, the situation now is different.\"For brother to truly stand up from his wheelchair and walk under the sunlight like a normal person, he would need an 'elixir of life'. This 'elixir of life' is worth at least 30 billion! Unless I become a wargod, then, at this rate, it'll take a super long time for me to earn that much money. Stealing this dragon egg away is the perfect chance!\".Once this thought appeared in Luo Feng's mind, he couldn't contain himself anymore.The price of a dragon egg is beyond high. Since the corpse of a dragon isn't too hard to get, but a dragon egg is...... Since receiving the news of a dragon laying an egg is extremely difficult, and the monsters that have received the title of 'dragon' are extremely proud. Once they think they might die, they would rather destroy the egg than allow it to fall into human hands.Because of this, the amount of dragon eggs that humans have got around the world is extremely low. Naturally, the price would also be high.\"Even though that family mart is a monster nest and there are huge amounts of monsters stationed there... no horde leader monsters are there right now! If I fail, then I'll just escape!\" Luo Feng clenched his teeth, \"I'll go for it. If I succeed, then I'll earn a ton!\".Instead of continuing to spectate, Luo Feng immediately jumped off of the balcony on the 16th floor and headed towards the ground like an arrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A group of kids happily made some snowmen and fought in snowball fights. A couple old people were also slowly and freely taking a walk inside the sector. The streets outside of the sector were filled with manly sports cars and Coupes with beautiful curves. Sometimes, an extravagant car with flying capabilities could be seen flying by.Chen Gu and his wife sat on a clean stone bench as they watched their children make snowmen not too far away.\"The headquarter cities are definitely a better place to be in\" Chen Gu couldn't help but to sigh.\"They are good, since the wilderness is filled with monsters. Only fighters can go out there. I say, old Chen, when are you going to retire from your fighter squad?\" Chen Gu's wife on the side said sadly, \"You've been giving it your all for all these years. It's about time you take a break and enjoy life\".Chen Gu looked at his wife, and then looked at his son at a distance: \"My wife, I can't keep thinking about retiring! Our fire hammer squad is currently in a period of rapid growth, and I want to fight with my old brothers for a bit more. Maybe after another one and a half years, my strength won't be able to keep up with the squad's. And at that time, the squad is probably going to recruit new members. When that happens, I'll retire!\".Chen Gu was clear.....Besides Luo Feng, the members of the fire hammer squad were quite old. With Luo Feng's astonishing rate of improvement...... after another one and a half years, Chen G, Wei Qin, and Wei Tie probably can't keep up, so it'll be normal for them to retire.\"I heard from Luo Feng's parents that Luo Feng still hasn't returned. Is he still in the wilderness?\" asked Chen Gu's wife.\"Hm, yeah\" Chen Gu nodded.\"Isn't he trying too hard\" Chen Gu's wife couldn't help but to sigh, \"He should know when to stop. And the headquarter city is so peaceful and comfortable\".The headquarter city is comfortable, and it's free from the threat of monsters. Today's technology brings mankind various types of comfort.As for the wilderness, danger lurks everywhere.\"What do you understand, if everyone just wanted to enjoy themselves, then how would mankind fight against monsters?\" Chen Gu couldn't help but to scold, \"It is because of the efforts of countless scientists and their painstaking work and, more importantly, the power of the wargod fighters, and even the existences beyond the wargods! Because of them, humans can peacefully live in headquarter cities!\".A headquarter city and the wilderness are practically two different worlds.One is a comfortable, peaceful world.One is a bloody world where danger lurks in all corners. In the wilderness, only the absolute elite, the 'fighters', can venture there.\"Oh yea, my wife, when Luo Feng's parents ask you again, you just tell them..... Luo Feng will be back soon\" said Chen Gu.\"I understand\" Chen Gu's wife nodded.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdUnlike the atmosphere of the headquarter city, a peak showdown was going on with two wargods and three horde leaders in the northern outskirts of #003 city, a city with practically the largest amount of monsters in all of Europe and Asia.\"I need to increase my speed!\"\"Otherwise, if the monster horde leaders achieve victory and return to the nest, I'll have no chance at all. If the human wargods achieve victory, then I'll still have no chance if they go to the monsters' nest\" Luo Feng was speedily moving forward, \"My only chance is this small timing where they're fighting against each other\".Luo Feng, who was supported by his family and friends in the headquarter city, was now using all of his power to race through the city that was densely packed with monsters.Luo Feng quickly entered the smoke covered area.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng gasped and dashed into the 5th floor of a six story residential building. From the window and through the smoke ahead, tons and tons of all types of monsters were densely packed on the streets. Even some shops, residential buildings, offices, etc. were densely packed with large amounts of monsters.With the supermarket as it's core, the smoke covered area was filled with monsters!\"What should I do?\" Luo Feng frowned, \"The monsters are too densely packed. I have practically no chance of entering without attracting any attention\".Even the two great wargods Wang Tong and Li Kan can't enter this densely packed area without attracting any attention. They can only choose to barge in with force!\"If wargods can't sneak in, then if I try, I'll die for sure\".\"Looks like, there's only one way!\" Luo Feng shook his head as he laughed. Luo Feng's biggest advantage compared to the wargods is...... flight!KA! KA!Luo Feng unbuckled the hexagonal shield on his back and, under the control of his spiritual force, the shield hovered in front of Luo Feng.\"Hmhm, flying into the nest of the monsters. Exciting\" Luo Feng leaped onto the hexagonal shield, which just hovered around half a meter away from the ground.\"Go!\"Whoosh!The hexagonal shield shot out of the window with astonishing speed. When Luo Feng controls a knife, he can make it surpass the speed of a bullet fired from a sniper rifle! However, the weight of the shield added with Luo Feng's weight is a bit much. But with Luo Feng's powerful spiritual force, he can still make the hexagonal shield travel at near the speed of sound.However.....\"I can't fly too quickly, or else the sonic boom would be too loud and therefore attract the monsters' attention\" Luo Feng stood on his shield as he flew around 50 meters above the ground.Since the smoke was thick, the field of vision of both humans and monsters was small. Because of that, Luo Feng wasn't discovered!\"The smoke sure has helped me out a lot\"Just like this.....Even though the monsters were all over the ground, the shops, the residential apartments, and the offices, the monsters under the steel armored dragon's command were all land monsters and not flying ones, so none of them could fly..... that, and the small field of vision prevented the monsters from discovering Luo Feng.\"Family mart!\"Luo Feng, who was in midair, barely found the short building that took up a lot of space. The entire family mart had five stories. According to the original design, the first and second floors were part of the supermarket. As for the third, fourth, and fifth floors, they were used for larger home appliances, etc. Of course, after dozens of years, these goods are unrecognizable after being ruined by monsters.But the five story building was practically the same as it was when it was built.\"Hm?\"Luo Feng took out the binoculars from his bag and carefully observed. Even though there was a lot of smoke, looking through the binoculars was still clearly more effective than using the naked eye. Through the window that has long been shattered, a few monsters on the third, fourth, and fifth floors of the family mart could be seen.Strangely enough, there weren't any monsters on the first and second floor.And there were huge amounts of monsters everywhere in the surrounding area near the supermarket.\"The intellect of the horde leader is extremely high, like a human's!\" Luo Feng thought to himself, \"If I was the horde leader, then I would certainly wish that my underlings would be restricted from coming to the place I was living at. So the first and second floor is most likely where the horde leader, 'steel armored dragon', lives!\".\"As for the third, fourth, and fifth floor, his elite forces should be the only ones that have the right to live there. I guess they're commander level\".Luo Feng carefully observed from above the five story supermarket. He even circled around the supermarket and examined this monster nest from all directions. Without absolute certainty, Luo Feng wouldn't dare to barge into this monster nest.\"This is--\"Luo Feng was in midair, holding his binoculars as he observed the ground below him. This pair of binoculars was especially made for fighters. It was expensive, but at the same time, also very effective. Luo Feng could barely see the monsters standing in front of the front door of the supermarket..... These monsters were all huge and had slick fur and detailed scales.\"Medium level commanders, This one is a medium level commander, high level commander, medium level commander, high level commander..... medium level commander..... high level commander.....\" Luo Feng continuously differentiated.After differentiating 52 monsters, Luo Feng stopped looking at the other half of them.\"Out of these 52 monsters, there are 32 medium level commanders and 20 high level commanders! Not even one low level commander\".\"There are probably near a hundred commander level monsters in this horde stationed at the front of the monster nest. I estimate that there's around 60 to 70 medium level commanders and 30 to 40 high level commanders\" Luo Feng speculated as he gave out some numbers, and couldn't help but to be surprised.Holy shit!This monster nest, besides the huge amounts of monsters outside, even has this 'commander squad'! And there are 30 to 40 high level commanders!If it's a beginner level wargod, he'll probably flee! If he fights, he'll most likely die!An intermediate level wargod, might have a chance.An advanced level wargod, probably can rush through the defense of this commander squad.\"What should I do? There are monsters on the third, fourth, and fifth floors! And there are countless amounts of monsters surrounding the supermarket and there's even a commander squad in front of the front door..... How can I get in? How can I, under the condition of not attracting their attention, steal that steel armored dragon's dragon egg away?\" Luo Feng speedily thought to himself while he stood on his hexagonal shield in midair in the smoke filled air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That space was originally made for customers to leave their cars and to allow more customers to enter the supermarket. Before the Grand Nirvana period, there were over 100 million people living in the surroundings. And that's not including potential customers who visited from other areas.However, in the present day, the open space was filled with countless monsters.\"How can I enter the steel armored dragon's nest and steal the dragon egg away?\"\"Should I rush as fast as I can through the first or second floor's window?\" Luo Feng, still in midair, watched the densely packed monster horde below, \"With all these monsters, quite a few of them would see me rush in! And then it'll be over!\".\"I should go down first. Staying in midair like this uses up quite a bit of spiritual force\" Luo Feng flew above the center of the supermarket. The supermarket took up a huge amount of area! Likewise, the area of the roof was just as astonishing, and it was completely empty; not a single monster in sight.This isn't surprising, since even the monsters enforce their levels.Horde leader, commander, soldier!With the supermarket acting as the core of the monsters' nest, the monsters living here are also the ones with the highest position in the monster horde..... either commander level or horde leader level! These monsters don't like dealing with the weather, so most of them lived on the third, fourth, or fifth floor.As for the steel armored dragon, it had the first and second floor all to itself.The two low level horde leader 'flame scaled triple halberd boars' lived in a commercial building right beside the supermarket, around 100 meters away.Only the countless regular monsters have to deal with the rain and wind as they stay in the open space. And whether a horde leader monster or a commander monster, they naturally wouldn't allow those regular monsters to enter the core area, which is why there wasn't a single monster on the roof.Whoosh!Directly descending from the sky, Luo Feng flew down to the middle area of the roof. The monsters in the open space were all quite far from Luo Feng, so they didn't discover him.\"How am I supposed to enter the first and second floor?\" Luo Feng stooped on the roof, \"The third, fourth, and fifth floors are probably all filled with the elite of the monsters!\".\"The open space of the supermarket is also filled with countless monsters\"\"How am I supposed to get in?\"All the plans Luo Feng formulated were rejected in his mind. Clearly, the nest of the steel armored dragon was like a steel wall, extremely difficult to barge into.\"RUMBLE~~\"The battle between the two wargods and the three horde leader monsters made it seem like the sky was shaking and the ground was shattering. Countless howls of monsters quickly followed after a roar and the sound of a building falling carried over.And Luo Feng was still stooped as he thought to himself.\"That's it!\" Luo Feng's eyes flashed, \"The supermarket has five floors above the ground, but with the underground parking lot, there's six floors in total!\"\"These kinds of supermarkets all have elevators, and there should be two of them. One of them is opened to the customers, while the other one is used to transport the supermarket's goods. This elevator well is a direct passage! As long as I can find this elevator passage, then I can directly fall to the first and second floors in a breath!\"Of course, the elevator well could've been destroyed by monsters already.But since the elevator well is so small, and the monsters don't want to destroy the infrastructure of this supermarket, then the tiny elevator well in the side of the supermarket should have a huge chance of surviving. Furthermore..... the supermarket has two elevator wells: one for the 'customer elevator' and the other for the 'freight elevator'.\"The elevator well!\" Luo Feng started searching on the roof near the sides of building.The method for searching was quite simple: Luo Feng extended his spiritual force through the stairs of the roof and searched through the infrastructure below. Of course, only spirit readers can use this method! Luo Feng was extremely careful as he was virtually crawling across the roof, afraid of being caught by the huge amounts of monsters below.\"Found it!\" Luo Feng let out a face of happiness, \"Yes..... extend, extend downwards\"\"Fourth floor, third floor.....\"Luo Feng kept extending his spiritual force downwards as he investigated the infrastructure of the elevator well. The entire well wasn't damaged too much, since the monsters apparently protected this supermarket quite well. This is their home after all!\"CHI!\"Two black throwing knives started hovering and lightly drew a circle on the roof! This 9th series throwing knives was way tougher than diamond, so, as if it was cutting through tofu, it quickly cut out a circular hole in the roof. That stone circle, affected by Luo Feng's spiritual force, started hovering and then softly landed on the side, making no sound at all.\"Hmhm\" Luo Feng lowered his head as he looked down, \"This elevator well, yup, seems like it's a bit bent at the third floor's elevator door. But overall, it hasn't changed much\".Luo Feng let out a smile.The hexagonal shield started hovering beside him, and Luo Feng stepped onto it, \"Go down!\". The hexagonal shield slowly descended, making no sound at all. Fifth floor, fourth floor, third floor..... the steel wires and the steel elevator door could all be seen, but have long been covered by dust. It has been far too long since the last person has used them.\"This is where the first floor is\" Luo Feng hovered in front of one of the elevator doors.The elevator door was sealed shut, and with a heartbeat, two throwing knives immediately stuck into the gap between the shut elevator doors. They then lightly pushed towards both directions.\"CHI CHI~~\"Perhaps because the elevator door hasn't been opened for too long, but it actually made a sound at a time like this, frightening Luo Feng.\"I'm inside the supermarket and there aren't any monsters on the first and second floor. If the sound was extremely quiet..... then the monster squad outside shouldn't be able to hear it\" Luo Feng took a deep breath and extremely slowly opened the elevator door. Since he opened it slowly, the sound the doors made was also very small.When the elevator doors were half way opened, thanks to his spiritual force, Luo Feng easily used his understanding of the elevator's door's structure to bend the steel and jam the elevator door.'Done!\"Luo Feng continued to hold his breath. Not daring to relax even the slightest bit, he lightly moved forward and stepped on the ground. His hovering shield then immediately dropped beside him, and the two buckles on his back, with his spiritual force, naturally sealed the shield in place.\"This place smells so bad\" a thick, nasty odor emanated around the first floor. After breathing a bit of this smell, Luo Feng's body started to become uncomfortable.\"Where's that steel armored dragon's dragon egg?\" Luo Feng carefully moved forward, his spiritual force used on his body, shield, and combat gear to cause his body to become as light as a swallow. Each of his steps were light and made no sound.\"Hu! Hmhm!\"Luo Feng raised his head and looked above. The ceiling between the first and second floor was basically entirely broken. Only the framework of the supermarket on the side wasn't broken. All the broken, old stalls and rotten food have been pushed to the sides. Sometimes, Luo Feng's road is blocked, so he has to use his spiritual force to lightly make a path.\"The steel armored dragon would probably live in the center of the supermarket, since that's the most spacious area\" Luo Feng directly headed towards the center. Slowly, Luo Feng started to see an oval shaped ball.\"The dragon egg?\"Luo Feng held his breath and slowly moved forward.The monster howls from outside the supermarket carried in, causing Luo Feng to be even more careful. Each of his steps were as light as light can be.\"This place smells even more\" The closer Luo Feng got to the oval shaped ball, the more apparent the odor became, \"I guess the steel armored dragon is usually there, and this odor is caused by the steel armored dragon's body\". Quickly, Luo Feng arrived at a distance of around 10 meters away from the dragon egg and was already able to clearly see the dragon egg.This was a dragon egg that was around one meter tall. The egg shell was blue, and there were some light lines on it.\"The dragon egg of the steel armored dragon!\" Luo Feng's eyes flashed. He was already in grasping distance of the egg.\"But who knows what kind of traps the steel armored dragon could've put around the dragon egg to stop others from stealing it. However, since the dragon egg is alive, my spiritual force probably can't move it\". With a thought, Luo Feng's six throwing knives flew over and cut open an oval shape in the ground below the dragon egg and lightly dragged the entire egg, like an iron ring dragging the dragon egg.Just in case, the blunt side of the knives carried the dragon egg.\"Dragon egg, come\" Luo Feng already opened his bag and started to open the bag one layer at a time. He opened half of the bag. The entire bag can store an object as large as a person.The steel armored dragon's dragon egg slowly flew over.....Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The steel armored dragon's green, oval shaped dragon egg was currently surrounded by six throwing knives and was being dragged into the bag. After that, the six throwing knives swiftly returned to Luo Feng's thigh pockets.\"CHI!\" Luo Feng tightened his bag and immediately secured the dragon egg in the innermost area of the bag.\"I've earned a ton, now I gotta go now!\"Luo Feng carried his bulging bag and prepared to leave, but right when he turned around...\"What's that?\" Out of the corner of his eye, Luo Feng noticed some things laid out on the ground not too far away from him. Since this is where the steel armored dragon sleeps, it would probably sweep away the things that are distracting to him. Stuff like refrigerators and broken goods have already been swept to the side ages ago.The ground was empty.But on the empty ground, there were a few things that were placed not too far from the egg. One could guess that the steel armored dragon probably looked at these things every day.\"Why would the steel armored dragon put these things in its field of vision?\" Luo Feng's heart skipped a beat as he swiftly headed over.As he moved forward, Luo Feng's heart started beating faster and faster.\"Could it be.....\"\"Could it actually be.....\" when Luo Feng arrived at around three meters in front of the goods, he became so excited that he couldn't control himself. He couldn't help but to tightly clench his fists, \"It really is! Now I've really earned a lot, a ton!\".What was in front of Luo Feng was an entire armor set: alloyed battle boots, a uniform, etc. At the same time, there was also a sheathed sharp blade in the sheath of the armor. The material the armor was made out of was pure black. This utter darkness caused one to inadvertently hold their breath..... and the detail on that sheathed blade was way more intricate than Luo Feng's ghost blade.\"There's no doubt that this is the armor and weapon of a wargod\" Luo Feng was extremely excited, \"A glance is all that is needed to tell that this uniform is very special. That blade..... who knows how many times more powerful it is compared to mine\".\"And, this is a human's armor set, and yet the steel armored dragon collected it! Perhaps killing the owner of these items is one of the things that the steel armored dragon takes pride in\". Luo Feng was easily able to figure the situation out, since horde leaders have an intelligence level comparable to a human's. And sometimes, wargods can't defeat the monster horde leaders.However, the escaping ability of the human wargods is extremely high!In the entire country of China, the fall of a wargod is an extremely rare sight. Every time a wargod from their respective country falls, the entire country holds a memorial which is broadcasted live! One could imagine just how difficult it would be for a horde leader to kill a wargod!So a wargod's old gear is also an extremely rare sight in the wilderness!\"If this gear can make the steel armored dragon so proud, proud enough to collect this uniform set... then this human wargod must be extremely powerful..... And this uniform set has also went through a battle with a high level horde leader, and yet it's barely damaged. The quality of this uniform must be excellent, at least a 9th series!\" Luo Feng quickly extrapolated.According to the market price.An entire Q series battle uniform's full price is 12 billion Chinese dollars. So the half price put in place by the Limit Home would be 6 billion Chinese dollars.\"A second hand battle uniform probably can't sell for 6 billion. However, it's still possible to sell it for 2 to 3 billion!\"\"And this is using the price for a 9th series uniform. If this battle uniform is rank SS!\" Luo Feng could feel his blood boiling.1st series to 9th series, are respectively divided into the grades: H grade, G grade..... C grade, B grade, A grade, and S grade. These nine grades. A 9th series weapon and uniform would be an S grade weapon and uniform!And above the S grade is the SS grade!A SS grade battle uniform can defend against many SS Emperor level monsters' attacks. As for the horde leaders, they definitely are not able to destroy a SS grade battle uniform.\"If it's the SS grade that's even more valuable than the 9th series..... then that'll be an astronomical price\" Luo Feng was extremely excited.9th series (S grade) battle uniform set, full price 12 billion.And a SS grade battle uniform set, it's full price is an astonishing 120 billion! Definitely not a price that an average person or power could afford to buy!Know that, this battle uniform can defend against the bites and attacks of many Emperor level monsters. The level difference between an Emperor level monster and a horde leader monster is extremely shocking. An Emperor level monster can sweep the floor with a group of horde leader monsters; absolute domination! As for the existences that surpass the wargod level like Hong and Thunder God, they also can decimate other wargod level humans.Naturally.....The price of some SS grade gear would be much higher than the S grade.The full price of an SS grade uniform set is 120 billion, so even it's half price would be 60 billion!\"If, just if, this is a SS grade uniform set, then even though it's second hand and can't be sold for 60 billion, it's still possible for it to be sold for 20 to 30 billion\" Luo Feng was extremely excited, \"Perhaps my earnings this time would be able to earn enough money to buy my brother an Elixir of Life\".Of course..... whether or not this battle uniform set is actually SS grade, even Luo Feng doesn't know.But it's at least a 9th series (S grade) for sure, so it could also be SS grade.Even though all of this has been said, in reality, all of these thoughts passed through his mind in an instant when Luo Feng walked up to this battle uniform set and blade.Without delay, he immediately opened his bag.\"If it's SS grade, then it'll be worth much more than the dragon egg!\" Luo Feng swiftly controlled his spiritual force and moved the battle uniform, alloyed boots, arm guards, blade, etc. into his bag.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe commander monsters in front of the gigantic supermarket were patrolling the premises. A few dozen commanders were in front of the main gate. Occasionally, they would turn back their heads to look into the supermarket. Through the huge main door, with the commander monsters' eyesight, they could barely see the shape of the oval shaped dragon egg.Protect the dragon egg! This is the task that their leader, the steel armored dragon, has entrusted to this commander monster squad!This is also why this monster squad didn't follow to join the battle against the two human wargods.One of the high level commanders, the bloodthirsty tank, was laying there. His gigantic body was like a hill, and it randomly and slowly turned it's head towards the supermarket's interior..... it doesn't even know how many times it has repeated this action, and in the past, the blurry image of the dragon egg was easily seen.But this time\u04bb\u04bb\"BOOM!\" the bloodthirsty tank ferociously stood up, it's huge eyes opened wide as if they were about to roll out their sockets. It then immediately let out an anxious roar.\"HOWL.....\" the ear-piercing, enraged roar immediately rang around the area.The other commander level monsters in front of the main gate of the supermarket then turned their heads and looked towards the dragon egg's location in the supermarket, and let out enraged roars one by one.At the same time\u04bb\u04bbAll of the commander level monsters, whether the ones patrolling outside, the ones in front of the supermarket door, or even the ones resting on the third, fourth, and fifth floors in the supermarket all roared as they rushed together towards the first floor. Huge holes were smashed in the ceilings and walls. For a time, the entire five story supermarket was rumbling, as if it was about to fall over.Far away.The steel armored dragon and the two flame scaled triple halberd boars were still battling against the two human wargods, Wang Tong and Li Kan. At this time, the scales on the steel armored dragon's head were split apart and one of it's eyes was blinded. There were also some signs of blood on Wang Tong, but he was in much better condition than the steel armored dragon.\"HOWL.....\" a roar carried from the direction of the supermarket.The steel armored dragon's only eye basically instantly turned crimson red.\"ROAR~~~\" The ear-piercing howl immediately split the sky. The sound formed a visible shockwave that crazily swept around the area. The surrounding concrete floor instantly shattered and even the steel beams broke apart, causing a huge amount of dust to lift up. This enraged howl virtually rang across the entire #003 city!\"Not good!\" Wang Tong's face dramatically changed.Enraged!This steel armored dragon is enraged!\"ROAR~~~\" the steel armored dragon's roar started to become hoarse. One could feel from this roar the flame of anger that won't subside even if drenched in the three major oceans.The steel armored dragon's speed instantly accelerated to a level never seen before. It didn't even worry whether or not it's body could handle it, and just headed towards the family mart supermarket. The horrifying sonic boom caused the ground, buildings, etc. to burst open, throwing pebbles all around.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdWhen Luo Feng was swiftly putting the battle uniform set and the other objects into his bag, an enraged howl carried from outside the supermarket. Following that roar were the roars of all the commander level monsters, causing Luo Feng to jump.\"What's going on?\" Luo Feng hesitated; he was pretty sure he made no sound at all.The ceiling above and the walls on the Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern sides all burst open, causing gigantic holes to appear. And from these holes came charging the enraged commander level monsters! Protecting the dragon egg was the biggest task handed to them from their leader, the steel armored dragon.The dragon egg is also the life of the steel armored dragon!No matter what, and no matter what they have to sacrifice, the dragon egg must be protected!\"Fuck, I've been found. RUN!\" Luo Feng didn't feel any emotion from stealing the dragon egg. Humans and monsters, this is the war between the two! Monsters want to obliterate humanity, while humanity wants to wipe the monsters off the face of the earth! To make the monsters sad and enraged is a good thing.Luo Feng instantly accelerated to his maximum speed and headed towards the elevator well. The gigantic commander level monsters that charged into the supermarket immediately chased after. Since the elevator door has been long jammed by Luo Feng, he was able to instantly rush into the elevator well.\"ESCAPE!\" Luo Feng immediately soared through the air.Luo Feng only felt that the entire supermarket was about to crumble. After a \"SA\" sound, the elevator well was directly blown up. Several commander level monsters destroyed the elevator well from inside and outside the supermarket. At the exact same time, the monsters on the third, fourth, and fifth floor immediately came rushing over.\"Not good\" Luo Feng immediately stepped onto the wall and, like a bolt of lightning, rushed up the elevator well and towards the sky outside!As long as he can get to the sky, he can escape!But right when Luo Feng got out, he saw tons of commander level monsters rushing towards him. The monster horde comprised of regular soldier level monsters didn't act much; only commander level monsters came rushing over from all sorts of places..... the weakest monster in the monster squad is a medium level commander.And more low level commanders were spread out in the monster horde, since they were usually leading their own group of monsters.And at this instant\u04bb\u04bbEven all of those commanders came chasing after him!All of them jumped, and each of them were capable of jumping over ten meters high. As for the monsters in the third, fourth, and fifth floors, they charged up to the roof, blocking Luo Feng's entire upper entrance.Above! Below!Surrounded on all sides!As for the steel armored dragon whose speed has long surpassed the speed of sound, it was charging faster than it's roar could spread out! With a blurry shadow that laid waste to all in its path, it charged into the smoke filled area. In only a few short seconds, the enraged, crimson eyed steel armored dragon will arrive at the family mart supermarket!-Still going to use these this note thing I used before for now lol.

At this moment, over a hundred commander level monsters were directly above Luo Feng, and there were even more waiting on the ground! However, there are only around 60 medium level commanders and just 30 high level commanders within these hundreds of commander level monsters. The rest are all low level commanders.But with such an astonishing amount, even a beginner level wargod can't escape!\"Shit\" Luo Feng sharpened his gaze while he clenched his teethHis body was in midair, but with a peculiar turn, he dodged an attack from a commander level monster! Dodge! Dodge! Dodge! With his spiritual force used on his shield, sheath, blade, battle boots, and arm guards, he was able to apply various amounts of force on many different areas of his body, causing his body to dodge in a weird pattern in midair. Note that these monsters are all huge, so Luo Feng's body is quite small in comparison.Because of this, under normal circumstances, only two to three monsters maximum can attack Luo Feng at the same time! Dodge! Keep dodging! None of the monsters could change direction in midair, so they could only helplessly fall down as they let out disgruntled roars. As for Luo Feng, he was like a butterfly. His 'tiny' figure quickly, rapidly, and erratically changed directions in midair, causing all of the monsters' attacks to strike just the air.\"Almost, just one or two seconds more and the monsters in the air will dramatically decrease. After that, I'll be able to escape\" Luo Feng was basically using all of his energy to escape, and he didn't dare to touch the ground.\"HOWL~\"\"HOWL~ HOWL~\"Right when the commander level monsters in the air touched the ground, they virtually immediately organized after one of the high level commander level horned boar let out a deep howl! Around 60 monsters jumped together and formed a two layer 'encasement' in the air.Commander level monsters are quite intelligent, and high level commanders' intelligence is nearly comparable to that of a human's! Since they failed before, the monsters immediately changed their battle plan! They organized themselves and jumped together, forming an encasement to completely block Luo Feng.\"RUMBLE!\" Another group of commander level monsters came jumping.Another layer added to the encasement! Three layers, four layers, five layers! Nearly two hundred commander level monsters came leaping and formed a five layer encasement headed straight towards Luo Feng.\"Aren't these monsters a bit too smart, they found out a way in an instant\" Luo Feng looked at the 'encasement' formed by the monsters that gave him no room at all and couldn't help but to feel nervous. Adding on to that, the monsters gave no time at all for Luo Feng to think and instantly arrived in front of him.\"Gotta put everything on the line!\"Luo Feng clenched his teeth and pretended to dodge. Naturally, the 'encasement' formed by the large amounts of monsters froze, and Luo Feng finally got close to one of the medium level commander level bloodthirsty tanks.\"HOWL~\" The bloodthirsty tank with flaming red scale roared and widely opened it's mouth as it's eyes turned crimson red. The teeth in it's mouth were like a saw chain that could easily rip apart steel. The four powerful hooves that were able to support it's gigantic body also came cruelly stomping towards Luo Feng.\"Hmph!\" A black light flashed in front of Luo Feng.PUCHI! The black light instantly shot into the huge mouth of the bloodthirsty tank. With a BOOM, the tough skull of the bloodthirsty tank was pierced and it's cerebrospinal fluid flew out. The eerie black light then drew a curved light as it flew back towards Luo Feng. The eyes of the previously enraged medium level commander level bloodthirsty tank instantly dimmed.With a contraction of his body, Luo Feng was right below the abdomen of the bloodthirsty tank!\"CHARGE UPWARDS NOW\"Luo Feng was contracted below the abdomen of the bloodthirsty tank. With the bloodthirsty tank's gigantic, truck-like body, it was easy for Luo Feng to hide below it.Whoosh! Luo Feng pushed the bloodthirsty tank's corpse and directly charged upwards! The bloodthirsty tank's corpse acted as a shield. When the commander level monsters above saw their comrade charge up, they hesitated. With just this small instant..... Luo Feng already rammed away the other monsters with the huge corpse above him.\"HOWL~\"\"HOWL HOWL~\"The commander monsters in the back didn't delay and started crazily attacking the bloodthirsty tank's corpse.Trampling! Ramming! Biting!Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! More commander level monsters on the ground caught sight of that damned human and actually stepped on the monster's corpse to jump up. They started ferociously leaping one by one! These commander level monsters can usually jump to a height of around 10 meters high, and sometimes even 20 meters high. And they can also jump extremely quickly!\"RUMBLE~\" Luo Feng could only feel waves of powerful attacks coming from above the monster corpse on him.Thanks to the gigantic monster corpse, Luo Feng was able to pass through nine layers of the encasement. However, the shocks of the attacks still dealt Luo Feng's body a damaging blow. With his organs shocked and a \"PU\" sound, he couldn't stop a mouthful of blood from spurting out his mouth.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\"Not good!\" Luo Feng, whose mouth was still bloody, saw the coordinated monsters come swooping towards him one by one.\"With a cycle of jumping, falling down, and then jumping back down..... this attack will never end! I can't even escape!\" Luo Feng's face changed dramatically.\"RUMBLE\"And the uninjured eye of the steel armored dragon that was currently flying past the speed of sound seemed like it was about to shed tears of blood. Under such extreme speed, the floor split open every time it's foot touched the ground. Under it's astonishing speed, it wouldn't even need two seconds to cover the 800 meters left between it's current position and the city.The wave of monster attacks drove Luo Feng into despair.\"That steel armored dragon isn't even 10 miles away, so it's going to arrive soon with it's super speed\" this thought instantly flashed across Luo Feng's mind. Soon, that high level horde leader, the steel armored dragon, is going to arrive. When that happens, he'll truly have no chance of escape. With the steel armored dragon's speed, he wouldn't be able to dodge any of it's hits.\"I gotta stake everything!\"\"I gotta keep trying as long as there's even a sliver of hope. If I don't give it my complete and absolute all, there's no doubt that I'll die!\"Within a second, Luo Feng made his decision.With his teeth clenched, Luo Feng had his ghost blade in hand and his shield on his back as he made an erratic movement in the air, causing him to directly ram into a commander level horned boar in midair. Luo Feng cruelly stomped onto the spine of the horned boar, sending it flying back towards the ground and even killing a regular soldier level monster in the process. Luo Feng used this force to ferociously fly back up!Charge! Charge! Charge!\"Howl~\" \"Howl~\" \"Howl Howl~\" The commander level monsters flew towards Luo Feng with bloodshot eyes, but Luo Feng's spiritual force has already spread out and has covered a scope of 15 meters.Five meters to the upper left came a medium level commander level 'horned boar', while three meters to the upper right came a low level commander level bloodthirsty tank.The two monsters came flying down from above. Luo Feng mind, who was on the verge of death, was able to work at an unprecedented speed and instantly make his decision.PU! Luo Feng used the horned boar to give himself a boost, thus increasing his own speed.PENG! Three monsters rammed into each other in midair.In just one second! Luo Feng turned into a mirage and continuously charged upwards as he passed 21 commander level monsters. Whether he used them to gain a boost, killed them, or even suffered injuries from them..... no matter what, he used every way possible to increase his speed! He has to use any and every method in his arsenal to reach the sky!\"Pu! Pu! PUCHI!\"Luo Feng finally escaped from the leaping monsters in the air. Once he got out, Luo Feng consecutively spit out three mouthfuls of fresh blood. His 5th series battle uniform was damaged and fresh blood was leaking out of his chest.\"I SURVIVED!!!\"Luo Feng, whose face was already pale, was extremely excited. He became even more excited as he looked at the surrounding smoke. If he even made one tiny mistake, he would've died. And yet, he couldn't believe that his frenzied struggle enabled him to escape.\"Looks like a human's limits can be forced out\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to laugh, \"In that short moment, I actually managed to take into account the positions of all 81 commander level monsters in the area and approached 21 of them to escape. Is this..... the technique that's above the Ru-Wei class, the 'Perfect' level that's able to take the surroundings into account?\"Luo Feng knew that the classifications for technique were 'Basic level'\u04bb\u04bb'Intermediate level*', \u04bb\u04bb'Perfect level', 'Conception level'.The intermediate level uses the smallest amounts of movements to dodge an attack and therefore using the movements as efficiently as possible.The perfect level takes the environment into control. It uses anything, like life, rocks, structures.... etc. in the surroundings to accurately dodge. This is the 'perfect' level technique! The old wargod 'Li Kan' is at this level! And shadow blade 'Wang Tong' has reached a level even higher, the 'Conception' level.\"There's still a huge difference between me and that huge wargod brute. First, he's just a fighter so he doesn't have any spiritual force to help him investigate the surroundings. As for me, I'm constantly spreading my spiritual force throughout the surroundings to see what's going on. Next, it was only on the border of life and death was my mind able to calculate that quickly. A truly perfect, 'perfect' level wouldn't need even the mind's calculation\".Just a short second of extreme calculation was enough to give Luo Feng a slight headache.\"HU!\" In a short moment, Luo Feng rushed up to a height of 60 meters in the air. The several hundred commander level monsters and the uncountable amount of regular soldier level monsters either angrily roared or leaped with all their might. Some dozens of monsters already in the air even jumped on each other to give themselves a boost!\"Get out of here!\" With a thought, a black light flew over! PUCHI! The high level commander level monsters that couldn't dodge in midair had their heads pierced through by Luo Feng's throwing knife and fell down to the ground.\"Haha...... Time to go!\" With a thought, the buckles on Luo Feng's back loosened and the shield flew below Luo Feng's feet. Whoosh! Luo Feng directly and speedily flew away.\"ROAR\" An ear piercing howl instantly carried over. The sound waves rippled the layers of Luo Feng's ears. \"My ears hurt like crazy\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to cover his ears as he looked back.What was seen was a gigantic body with deep green scales covering its entire body. It was like a light drawing across the sky as it directly flew over. The owner of that cold, one eye that gave off an enraged killing aura was indeed the steel armored dragon! High level horde leader\u04bb\u04bbSteel Armored Dragon!!! \"This is 80 meters up in the air, isn't that jumping distance a bit too messed up\" Luo Feng was shocked as he immediately and swiftly turned in the air and moved along a beautifully curved arc as he tried to evade the steel armored dragon.*TL note: I didn't know that 'Ru Wei' was actually talking about an actual level, since they never mentioned the classifications until now. If I wasn't sure, then I can't just say \"Intermediate\" since that would imply there are low and high levels. So from now on, Ru Wei class will be changed into intermediate level.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It can only sprint and jump. And of course, it can't change direction in midair, so getting rid of it should be easy\" Luo Feng was certain that he could escape. With his hexagonal shield below his feet, he directly flew across a curved arc in the air and headed straight towards the clouds!The only eye that the steel armored dragon had left stared at Luo Feng menacingly.\"ROAR~~\" Under its enraged howl, the steel armored dragon ferociously swung its tail!The 10 meter long dragon tail instantly turned into a green mirage as it swept towards Luo Feng. The distance that Luo Feng pulled apart was instantly covered again by this 10 meter long dragon tail. The high level horde leader level 'steel armored dragon' could sprint past the speed of sound, and the speed of its sweeping tail was 10 times faster than its sprinting speed!This dragon tail was several times faster than a bullet fired from the best sniper rifle! This is why high level horde leaders are horrifying!\"CHI!\"Probably because the dragon tail was too fast, high pressured airstreams were produced.\"It won't hit me, it's still 50 to 60 cm off!\" Luo Feng instantly determined.The tip of the dragon tail was off by Luo Feng's chest by half a meter; it couldn't hit him. However, the extremely high pressured airstream smashed against Luo Feng's chest like a gigantic sledgehammer. Thanks to that, Luo Feng felt like he couldn't breathe for a bit.\"PENG!\" Luo Feng's body was thrown away and he had to start stabilizing the shield.\"Just what one would expect from a high level horde leader. The high pressured airstream brought by the dragon's tail almost knocked me out\" Luo Feng could feel a mouthful of fresh blood coming up his throat and couldn't hold it any longer. With a \"PU!\" sound, a mouthful of fresh blood shot out.Luo Feng looked at the steel armored dragon that was still in midair and only saw its gigantic body falling towards the ground: \"You're not even a flying type monster. Unless you reach the Emperor level, you'll never be able to fly!\"Luo Feng smiled, completely relaxed himself, and then set his foot on his shield and flew upwards.HU!The feeling of flying is really fantastic!\"ROAR~\" the steel armored dragon stepped on the sidewalk in the city and leaped to the roof of a residential building that was a couple stories high. Once again, it ferociously jumped..... and at that instant, the roof of the residential building instantly crumbled. As that happened, large amounts of concrete directly tumbled down from the building.And the steel armored dragon used this jump to jump to a height of around 100 meters high, roaring as it charged towards Luo Feng.\"Steel armored dragon, no matter well you can jump, it's futile\" when Luo Feng saw that steel armored dragon jump to the roof of the residential building, he started ascending..... by continuously ascending, he easily reached a height of 300 meters above the ground.The steel armored dragon could only powerlessly fall back to the ground.HU! The steel armored dragon whipped its tail against the air, using the resistive force to make it fall back to the ground more quickly.\"It's useless\"Luo Feng continued to pull higher and even started to head away from the city.\"RUMBLE~~\" an ear piercing sound carried from below.\"Hm?\"Luo Feng, who was up in the sky, lowered his head and saw that steel armored dragon running around in the city. Sometimes it would jump over residential apartments, sometimes it would run on the sidewalk, and sometimes it would step on the buildings as it sprinted. It tried to stick to Luo Feng like glue as it chased him.\"I can't believe it's not giving up!\" Luo Feng's face slightly changed, \"As a high level horde leader, the steel armored dragon's sight is extremely messed up. Even if I fly up to a distance of two to three thousand meters above the ground, it'll still be able to see me as long as nothing is blocking its vision!\". Putting high level horde leaders aside, even Luo Feng can see a human two to three miles away.So, of course, it wouldn't be weird for this steel armored dragon to see someone five to six miles away.\"I'm not flying past the speed of sound, but its sprinting past the speed of sound, so it'll be hard to lose it. I guess the only way left is to fly above the clouds!\" Luo Feng started pulling higher again!Whoosh!Feet on his hexagonal shield, he directly started flying upwards again, hoping to past the clouds. After he's above the clouds, the steel armored dragon won't be able to see him again. Naturally, it won't be able to chase him any longer.\"GA~~\" \"GA GA GA~~\" as ear piercing calls from birds rang, a black, gigantic, densely packed flock of flying type monsters was seen coming from the West. And this gigantic flock was headed towards Luo Feng.\"I'm such an idiot!\" Luo Feng insulted himself. The sky was the territory of the flying monsters. Only astonishingly powerful aircraft are able to fly in the sky..... as for human fighters, if they dared to fly in the air, they'd naturally get hoarded by the flying type monsters' attacks!Before the Grand Nirvana period, the birds had superb vision. So it's not even necessary to explain how great their vision is now.These flying type monsters probably saw that he was flying in midair, so they instantly summoned the flock to surround him!\"I'm much more flexible compared to the monsters on the land near the family mart supermarket\"\"But compared to these flying type monsters..... that'll be jumping towards my death!\" Luo Feng didn't hesitate at all. Right when he noticed the black, dense flock of flying type monsters, he instantly charged back down towards the city.Fighting against the flying type monsters in the air means absolute death!And as long as he stays far away from the lone steel armored dragon, he still has some hope.\"ROAR~~\" when the steel armored dragon saw that the flying human actually started to come back down, it immediately headed towards Luo Feng.Luo Feng, in the process of his descent, followed the path of a huge arc!SHA!Luo Feng, like lightning and with a BOOM, directly smashed into a window on the balcony on the 12th floor of a residential apartment. The glass on the balcony immediately blasted open and Luo Feng charged in.\"RUMBLE~\" Like a deep green flash of light, the steel armored dragon ferociously charged and directly smashed into the balcony of the 8th floor of the residential apartment that Luo Feng charged into. Under the horrifying force of impact, the entire residential apartment shook violently. The concrete walls supporting the center of the building started to burst open, and the entire building started to slowly fall down.\"HUMAN!\"The steel armored dragon roared its monster speak and locked onto a moving shadow in front of it. The shadow that Luo feng formed, once again, charged into another residential building.\"ROAR~\"The steel armored dragon was afraid that its hesitation would allow Luo Feng to escape, so, without any hesitation, it directly rammed into the spot that Luo Feng passed through..... the entire residential building was sliced in half from the center, and then slowly started to fall down again!This is a medium sized sector, so only taking 12 story residential apartments into account, there are at least 20 of them. However, in chasing Luo Feng, the steel armored dragon has already led to the destruction of eight of them..... by going through the windows of the residential apartment, Luo Feng wasn't affected much. For the steel armored dragon's gigantic body, blasting away a residential apartment had a large effect on it.But, the steel dragon had no other choice!Because the residential buildings were blocking its vision!\"RUMBLE~\" When it destroyed the 8th residential apartment, the steel armored dragon suddenly stopped and stayed still on the ground.The 8th residential apartment slowly fell down and towards the steel armored dragon. However, the steel armored dragon didn't dodge. With a BOOM..... the entire residential apartment smashed into the steel armored dragon, but with the hardness of its scales, the residential apartment was like tofu and didn't harm the steel armored dragon at all.\"HUMAN, HUMAN.....\" the steel armored dragon angrily roared as it looked around.Yes!It lost Luo Feng!\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIn a dark electrical room in an underground parking lot below the small sector, Luo Feng was leaning against the wall.\"Breathe, breathe\" Luo Feng breathed slowly. He could feel a throbbing pain coming from his chest, and fresh blood soaked out of the chest area in his battle uniform.\"I received quite a serious wound this time. I already received a heavy wound when escaping from the encasement comprised of large amounts of commander level monsters from earlier. And now, the pressurized airstream generated by the steel armored dragon's tail hit my chest, making the wound even worse\" Luo Feng lightly rubbed his chest and a throbbing pain carried from it, causing Luo Feng's face to go pale.Even though he was heavily wounded, Luo Feng was in quite a good mood.\"That steel armored dragon probably can't find me if I hide in this electrical room in this underground parking lot\" Luo Feng let out a smile. When he charged towards this sector, his escape plan was already formed.In a sector like this, there must be an underground parking lot.He went through the residential apartments over and over to block the steel armored dragon's vision..... no matter how sturdy the steel armored dragon is, ramming into the residential apartment buildings over and over again had to have some sort of effect on it. Then, Luo Feng managed to grasp his chance. The entrance to an underground parking lot was not too far away from the 8th residential apartment. Naturally, he took his advantage and directly charged towards it.After the 8th residential apartment fell, the rubble covered the entrance to the underground parking lot. It looks like it would be quite difficult for the steel armored dragon to guess where Luo Feng is afterall.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"ROAR~~\"On the surface, the steel armored dragon's enraged roar carried over. This roar was much louder than its previous roars.\"RUMBLE~~\" What quickly followed was the vibration of the earth. At this time, all sorts of different roars also started ringing.Note that this steel armored dragon is the leader of all the monsters in a 20 to 30 mile radius. With a command, the monster horde comprised of over 100,000 monsters immediately spread out and headed towards every direction! Under the command of low, medium, and high level commanders, the monsters scanned the area in search of the human.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIn the dark, cold underground parking lot, the electrical room.\"The roars of the monsters aren't stopping and the ground keeps shaking. That steel armored dragon probably mobilized the entire monster horde in search of me\" Luo Feng's face changed. It would be hard for the steel armored dragon to find him alone, but with several tens of thousands of monsters searching in every possible location..... he'll probably be discovered if he stays put here.Since this sector is definitely where the steel armored dragon will focus on.\"Looks like I won't have the chance to tend to my wounds\"Luo Feng stood up and was quite relaxed, since the previous scenario was much more dangerous than his current one. After all, he has already escaped.And now, would he still not be able to get away?There are tons and tons of tunnels making up the #003 city's subway system.\"Hm, if I remember correctly, there should be a tunnel not too far away from here! I'll enter the underground tunnel and follow it. Then I'll be able to easily get out of #003 city. The tunnels are small, so even if there are monsters, they'll be smaller and weaker ones. At the very least, monsters like the steel armored dragon won't be able to squeeze in.\"It's time to go back home, back to the headquarter city\".\"Once I get back, I'll sell this dragon egg, that battle uniform set, and the blade! I don't know how much it'll sell for and whether or not I can get 30 billion\" even though Luo Feng's chest was throbbing with pain, his heart was only filled with infinite hope.Even though he has been working himself like crazy this time, if he's able to allow his little brother to grow out a new pair of legs, then it'll all be worth it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTwo shadows were currently standing on top of the messy roof of the family mart. Those shadows were precisely shadow blade, Wang Tong, and bear strength, Li Kan.\"Brother Wang, I can't believe we were taken advantage of this time\" Li Kan's voice was extremely deep, \"Since that steel armored dragon just laid an egg, a highly skilled fighter must've stolen the egg while we were fighting against the steel armored dragon. This was why that steel armored dragon went into a frenzy!\".\"Indeed, the city is also empty. There's nothing here\" Wang Tong nodded. When they came over, they've already checked the surroundings.As for that commander level monster squad, they can easily kill a low level wargod and can at least injure an intermediate level wargod.However! Against an 'advanced level wargod' like Wang Tong, the commander level monster squad will instantly crumble. After destroying the monster squad, Wang Tong and Li Kan searched the area.\"But seriously, this person..... really has no shame!\" said Li Kan lowly.Wang Tong laughed, \"Indeed, he has no shame! But to be able to safely escape from the assault of a commander level monster squad and successfully steal the dragon egg. This skill...... he's at least an intermediate level wargod! But an intermediate level wargod has so many different ways of making money, so why steal this dragon egg?\".Dragon eggs are worth a lot of money, but it depends on what you're comparing it to! For example, the difference between a dragon egg and a SS grade battle uniform set is gigantic.If this dragon egg hatches, then it'll be a 'young' steel armored dragon. Even after it grows, most steel armored dragons are only low level horde leaders. Only by going through battles over and over again can it grow and improve..... it's not always the case for the child to surpass the parent.For example, it's extremely difficult for the children of the strongest fighter on earth, 'Hong', to catch up to the strength 'Hong' possesses.A fully grown, normal steel armored dragon, in other words, a low level horde leader steel armored dragon, is worth around 3 billion.And since unhatched dragon eggs are extremely rare, they're worth more than a fully grown steel armored dragon. However, they're worth around 5.3 billion Chinese dollars. Even though 5.3 billion is quite a bit, an 'intermediate level wargod' can use his own strength to hunt monster horde leaders. There's no need for him to take advantage of other people.Which is also why Wang Tong and Li Kan aren't angry. They're only exclaiming the fact that this person has no shame!\"An intermediate level wargod taking advantage of us\" Li Kan shook his head.\"Well, no matter. Since that steel armored dragon is heavily injured and has pushed itself to its limits by sprinting that quickly, it must've worsened its injuries\" laughed Wang Tong, \"Our goal is to kill this high level horde leader level steel armored dragon, so we better not let it escape\"\"Let's go......\" Li Kan also nodded.A low level horde leader is worth around 500 million to 3.9 billion. Since there are many different species of low level horde leaders, the price would also vary by quite a bit. And a steel armored dragon is worth 3.9 billion.A medium level horde leader is worth around 1.5 billion to 9 billion.A high level horde leader is worth around 5.3 billion to 20 billion.Most of the horde leader monsters fall into this range. Of course, there'll always be exceptions. Naturally, there's no need to explain any further about those extremely rare monsters.This high level horde leader is worth around 18 billion. Sadly, only an extremely, extremely small portion of the 'advanced level wargods' have the ability to hunt a high level horde leader level steel armored dragon. Of course, this isn't including the existences that surpass the wargod level.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdOn the plains near the border of #003 city, the four members of the thunderbolt squad were currently staying in a room on the 8th floor of a 8 story building.Wang Tong and Li Kan told them them to leave the city and go to the highway, since that's the safest course of action. Despite that, the members of the thunderbolt were curious on how the battle between the two wargods and the 'high level horde leader level steel armored dragon' would go, so they decided to hide on the side of the city. From here, they can escape any time they deem it too dangerous to stay.\"RUMBLE~~\" within a radius of tens of miles of the city, the roars of tens of thousands of monsters rang across the skies.\"That steel armored dragon went mad and summoned its entire monster horde, which is now going out of control\" the old veteran named Liu couldn't help but to laugh, \"Mr. Wang sure is powerful, to be able to beat up the steel armored dragon to such an extent\".\"Yup, just what you would expect from the shadow blade\" tiger fang captain, Pan Ya, nodded in agreement.Even though they are on the outermost edge of the border and aren't too sure of what exactly has happened in the city, they naturally can guess based upon the sounds they can hear.\"A monster horde out of control, I wonder what that looks like\" the eyes of the mixed youth, Li Wei, flashed.\"Young master, even though this monster horde is tens of miles away, we should still leave now just in case. We can't hear anything else anyway\" laughed the old veteran named Liu. The white brute on the side, Ka Long, also looked towards the young master. The young master Li Wei nodded: \"Alright, let's depart and head towards the headquarter city\".Following that, the four members of the thunderbolt squad left the building and directly went to the nearest highway. They then proceeded to leave #003 city.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdIn the small sector, Luo Feng was walking inside the underground parking lot.The underground parking lot was quite vast. Most importantly, all the basements of the buildings in this sector were connected to this underground parking lot..... this way, the owners of the apartments can just go down their basements and enter the underground parking lots directly to find their cars.This layout also took the owners into consideration.\"Haha, interesting! I can't believe all of the buildings here are connected\" Luo Feng was carrying his bag as a throwing knife drew across a door. He then entered one of the basements of the connected buildings.This basement was divided into a billiard room, a music room, a bar area, etc.\"They sure know how to enjoy themselves\" laughed Luo Feng as he followed the staircase and headed towards the first floor of the building. He carefully hid behind the northern window in the living room and observed what was going on outside.A shaking deep green dragon tail could be seen around a hundred meters away. The dragon tail's green scales looked especially horrifying under the winter sun's light. As for the other parts of the steel armored dragon's body, they were blocked by a building.\"This steel armored dragon is quite intelligent. It probably thinks I'm hiding somewhere in the sector so it's looking for me carefully\" laughed Luo Feng as he went up to the third floor of the building. He lowered his body so that the steel armored dragon couldn't see him through the windows of the building...... well, after dozens of years, the windows of these buildings were already filthy dirty.Third floor of the building, one of the bedrooms.Luo Feng looked carefully through one of the bedroom windows and searched for the entrance to the subway that he caught a glimpse of when flying from before.\"Hmhm, it's over there!\" Luo Feng quickly discovered it. One of the entrances to the subway was right outside the small sector.Taking the underground parking lot's size and the terrain of the sector into account.....Luo Feng calculated the closest way to get there! \"I'll do it like this!\"Luo Feng carefully went downstairs to the basement and then went into the underground parking lot. According to what he remembered, he swiftly ran to a corner of the underground parking lot! \"From here, I'll directly dig forwards. I should be able to arrive inside the subway station within 30 meters\". Even though the distance is quite far, this is still the closest path.\"How am I supposed to dig?\"Luo Feng looked around and saw the various dirty cars in the underground parking lot.\"I know!\" Luo Feng slightly smiled.With a thought, a throwing knife suddenly flew out. It made no sound as it cut off the steel covering the front engines of two cars. With his spiritual force controlling them, the two pieces of steel immediately curled up and became cone shaped! Luo Feng himself lay inside the cone shaped pieces of steel.\"Go!\"Under control of his spiritual force, the throwing knives cut open a huge hole out of the tough concrete wall of the underground parking lot. The 'cone shaped steel' then directly flew in and started going through the soil! CHICHI~~ The subway station was long filled with dust, and one of the walls, with a \"PENG\" sound, had a half meter hole burst open from it. Concrete pieces fell all over the place. The tip of the cone shaped steel came out first, and the shadow hiding inside the cone rolled out onto the ground.\"Even though this way of digging is slower than the monsters with digging abilities, it's still quite fast for a human fighter\" Luo Feng's body was quite clean.Inside the subway, it was clear that it has been abandoned for far too long.Luo Feng observed the subway map and wiped off the dust on the glass covering the subway map. He closely observed, \"Hm, if I follow this tunnel, then I'll arrive at Kunshan city? What city is Kunshan city?\". People of the modern age have long forgotten the names of most cities before the Grand Nirvana period.Even Luo Feng only remembered the famous cities, like Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, etc.Kunshan? Who knows from where that popped out of. But one thing's for certain\u04bb\u04bbKunshan city isn't part of Shanghai.\"Yep, this line\" Luo Feng came to a subway tunnel that subway trains used to pass through and immediately jumped into it. He then speedily headed towards the direction of 'Kunshan' city.There were actually still some monsters in this subway tunnel. As Luo Feng progressed, he encountered quite a few monsters, most of which were weaker soldier level monsters. However, he also encountered three low level commanders and even one medium level commander. All of them were quite small though.And of course, the throwing knives that were under the control of his spiritual force\u04bb\u04bbcleaned them up quickly.Some portions of this subway tunnel were also above the ground. This line is the same subway line that connected Shanghai to Kunshan a long time ago.\"I've advanced around 100 miles, so I'm definitely out of #003 city\" Luo Feng checked the GPS on his tactical communications watch and, indeed, he was around 50 miles away from Shanghai city.\"I should get on the highway and head back to the headquarter city..... who knows what kinds of monsters will appear in the subway tunnel. And I also don't want to go to some Kunshan city. Who knows what kind of place that is\" Luo Feng was smiling brightly and was in a great mood. How can he not be happy? He has already escaped from Shanghai city.Luo Feng smiled as he carried his big backpack that held the dragon egg and the battle uniform set and, with his GPS' guidance, headed towards the highway's direction.\"Time to go home!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The stars were looking fine, and the weak starlight they emanated barely allowed one to make out the outline of the highway. On a certain section of the highway, the four members of the thunderbolt squad were sitting on top of a toppled bus.\"Even though the young master's training plan wasn't entirely completed, the young master's skill still raised by quite a bit\" said the old veteran named Liu as he smiled.\"Nothing special. But it's still quite a bit from what my dad wants\" said the mixed youth, Li Wei, as he shook his head.\"Young master, for your age, you're quite powerful already\" said the old veteran named Liu. Ka Long and Pan Ya nodded in agreement.Li Wei shook his head: \"It's not enough, not even close to enough! There are plenty of intermediate level warlords that are around 20 years old in Jiang-nan city. My parents are both powerful wargod fighters, so how can their son be so weak? Oh, also..... Pan Ya, you previously said that fire hammer squad's Luo Feng was only 18 years old last year right? And he's already a low level warlord! Me, the son of two great wargods, can't even compete with some random kid?\"\"Yes, yes\" responded the old veteran named Liu.\"Young master, you're the strongest\" added the white brute Ka Long.Li Wei slightly smiled.The tiger fang captain, Pan Ya, exclaimed, \"Indeed, it is as the young master says. Compared to the young master, Luo Feng isn't even worth a dog's ass! However, this Luo Feng is like a thorn in my side now. The fire hammer squad and tiger fang squad have always been on bad terms, and now that I'm the only person left in the tiger fang squad, the fire hammer squad will surely try to deal with me! Maybe the others won't pose too much of a problem, but this Luo Feng improves way too quickly!\".\"He just recently became a fighter and he's already a low level warlord. I'm sure that he'll soon surpass me too. When that happens, there's no doubt that I'll die!\" Pan Ya let out a long sigh.Indeed, Pan Ya was full of regret.When he previously met Luo Feng in the resupplying base, Zhang Ze Hu advised him to kill off Luo Feng. However, Pan Ya was afraid of making the rest of the fire hammer squad enraged, so he didn't take action! But who knew that ever since then, Luo Feng's skill rapidly climbed up and even managed to earn the nickname of 'crazy'. Killing off around ten thousand monsters in two months, most of them being high level soldier level monsters. This crazy incident has long spread throughout the circle of fighters in Jiang-Nan city.Sadly, Pan Ya never encountered Luo Feng until he came to #003 city.\"Aren't you going to join a new fighter squad when you get back\" said the mixed youth Li Wei.\"Yea, but the fire hammer squad will never forget this grudge. They might pick a time to secretly shoot a bullet at me\" said Pan Ya with a bitter face. He didn't forget that the tiger fang squad did the exact same thing to the fire hammer squad. And with his current strength, he'll certainly die if he was ambushed by a sniper rifle all of a sudden.Pan Ya looked towards the mixed youth Li Wei and asked: \"Young master, if you ever have the chance to go through your information network in the Underground Alliance, could you notify me where Luo Feng is in the wilderness?\"\"Sure, no problem\" said Li Wei heartily.The old veteran named Liu and the white brute exchanged glances. They have long knew that Pan Ya purposefully put on a worried look to try and get that young master to use some of his power.However, since the two of them are just bodyguards, they weren't going to bother with such a thing. And these days, Pan Ya was pretty good at kissing ass, which put the old veteran named Liu and the white brute in a good mood. Adding to that, Pan Ya's squad did indeed suffer great losses, so it's okay to help him out a bit. \"It's not early anymore, so we should rest now. We still have a long way to go tomorrow\" spoke the old veteran named Liu.Immediately, the four members of the thunderbolt squad started to rest.Unlike in the summer, most fighter squads rest in the night during the winter and hit the road during the day! It's hot in the summer, so they rest in the morning to avoid the sun and run in the night when it's cool.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdDeep in the night, the members of the thunderbolt squad either had their legs crossed or were laying on the ground as all of them rested. Except for the young master, the other three were only resting with their eyes closed. They didn't dare to fall asleep..... who knows when a monster will appear in the wilderness.Getting eaten by a monster while you're still in your dreams, that'll surely be something to regret.\"Hm?\" Pan Ya, the old veteran named Liu, and the white brute virtually opened their eyes at the exact same time as they heard a sound.The sound of footsteps!Suddenly, a shadow passed the bus and then suddenly turned his head..... the passing fighter established eye contact with Pan Ya, the old veteran named Liu, and the white brute.\"I can't believe I encountered them!\"Luo Feng wanted to curse the heavens. He was originally in a great mood and wanted to return home, but who knew that the four members of the thunderbolt squad were hiding behind a bus and resting. Because the bus was blocking his vision, Luo Feng didn't know that there were four people ahead of him. By the time he walked past the bus and discovered them, it was already too late!\"Luo Feng!\" Pan Ya roared, his eyes flashing with anger.Jeez..... he thought he would have to search long and hard for him! But who knew that this Luo Feng, this Luo Feng actually appeared in front of them alone!\"Oh, so this guy is that Luo Feng. I've seen you before\" the mixed youth, the young master Li Wei, just woke up and was already standing up. He coldly looked at Luo Feng..... Li Wei wasn't dumb: he long knew that the tiger fang captain Pan Ya wanted to kill Luo Feng. Now that Luo Feng has come to them himself, nothing more needs to be said.Pity could be found in Li Wei's eyes as he looked towards Luo Feng.\"Luo Feng, you barged into the gates of hell yourself\" the tiger fang captain Pan Ya glanced at the old veteran named Liu. The old veteran named Liu slightly nodded...... previously, Pan Ya asked senior Liu to help him eliminate the fire hammer squad. However, they weren't able to find the fire hammer squad that time.\"Tiger fang captain!\" Luo Feng's face changed dramatically.Barged into the gates of hell? Even a stupid person could figure out that Pan Ya had the intent to kill!However, without the other three on the side, it'll be hard to say who'll kill who.The three people on the side were a problem. Both the veteran named Liu and the white brute were 'advanced level warlords'. And even though that young master was weak, his background was horrifying! Several wargods are standing right behind him!Luo Feng turned towards the old veteran named Liu, the white brute, and the mixed youth and said, \"This guy here, the tiger fang captain Pan Ya, has a grudge with my fire hammer squad. I'm sure the three of you can see what he's about to do. The law says that fighters aren't allowed to kill each other! Of course, since we're in the wilderness now, the law is powerless\"\"I don't ask for the three of you to stop them, but to just stand by and not interfere. Let me and this Pan Ya have a battle to the death!\" Luo Feng looked towards the mixed youth, \"This young master here must be young master Li Wei. Even though I have not exchanged many words with young master Li Wei, I have heard of young master Li Wei's huge name before. It was from my fire hammer squad comrades that I heard you were young master Li Wei..... if I knew that, then I would've gave the twin headed black striped snake to you\"Luo Feng humbled himself and praised this young master Li Wei.\"Yup yup\" young master Li Wei slightly smiled, as he was clearly enjoying the praise of this genius fighter.\"As long as this Li Wei and the other two don't interfere, this'll be easy. Even if I kill Pan Ya in a direct confrontation, with Li Wei and the other two's status, they probably wouldn't bother to deal the matter\" Luo Feng expectantly hoped.Pan Ya immediately glanced at the old veteran named Liu. They had an agreement to get rid of the fire hammer squad.\"Who are you? Speaking in such a roundabout matter like this!\" scolded the old veteran named Liu.\"Senior\" Luo Feng humbled himself.\"Who's your senior\" the old veteran named Liu glared, \"Pan Ya's two comrades were probably killed by you! Since you killed Pan Ya's comrades, even death won't wash away your guilt!\". Li Wei smiled on the side as he prepared to watch how his subordinates will go about killing Luo Feng.Luo Feng is a genius?Killing a genius is also a very interesting thing.\"What should I do, what should I do?\" Luo Feng's face was bitter.\"I can definitely kill Pan Ya alone, but it'll be hard if the other three come into play. Especially that young master Li Wei..... if they act, should I fight back? If I don't fight back, I'll die. If I do fight back..... then even if I can kill all of them, I'll be in gigantic trouble after killing Li Wei\"\"But if I don't kill him and Li Wei takes his revenge, it'll be even worse!\"Many different kinds of thoughts flashed across Luo Feng's mind instantly.The old veteran named Liu, the white brute, and Pan Ya split up as they approached Luo Feng.Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!Luo Feng threw three throwing knives straight towards Pan Ya, turned around, and then ran![DANG]! [DANG]! [RING]!Pan Ya's triangular saber swiftly blocked two of the throwing knives. He then dodged the third one.\"Hu!\"The old veteran named Liu, the white brute, and Pan Ya instantly accelerated as they prepared to kill Luo Feng.But right when they did that, the two throwing knives that fell on the ground after being deflected by Pan Ya instantly shot towards the heads of the veteran named Liu and the white brute! The veteran named Liu and the white brute were turned away from the two throwing knives. Adding to that, Luo Feng's spiritual force accelerated the throwing knives to insanely high speeds!The throwing knives were a bit faster than a bullet fired from a sniper rifle! Before the sound of the sonic boom reached them, the throwing knives that were several times faster than speed have already arrived!\"PU!\" \"PU!\"Two eerie black lights instantly went through the heads of the veteran named Liu and the white brute from behind! With two \"PENG\" sounds, their heads directly bursted open. These two unsuspecting advanced level warlords were directly and instantly killed!\"WHAT!\" exclaimed Pan Ya.The throwing knife that pierced the head of the veteran named Liu flew along a curved arc and instantly shot towards Pan Ya! A direct attack! Sadly, Pan Ya was only an intermediate level warlord. He desperately waved the triangular saber he had in hand and barely grazed the edge of the eerie black light. However, the eerie black light slightly changed paths.PUCHI!Pan Ya's head was directly sliced off!\"AH!\" All of this happened too quickly. The mixed youth, Li Wei, who was happily observing couldn't help but to widen his eyes and immediately go for his tactical communications watch as he saw the heads of the old veteran named Liu and the white brute burst open.PUCHI!The third throwing knife dodged by Pan Ya directly drew across Li Wei's neck!A huge head, a head worth an astronomical price, flew up just like that. Fresh blood sprayed from the wound like a fountain!In an instant!The four members of the thunderbolt squad, killed!\"The rabbit got hasty and tried to bite someone!\"\"You really think I wouldn't have killed you!\"\"Fuck you, you just have wargod parents. Even if they actually find out that I'm the killer..... I could always expose my identity as a spirit reader, give up my freedom, and join the core of the Dojo of Limits.Furthermore...... who knows whether or not your old dad can actually find me!\" Luo Feng put away his throwing knives and at the same time, turned into a shadow and ran off the highway into the grass filled fields.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLike an arrow, Luo Feng shot through the grassy fields; his speed reaching an astonishing level. Using his spiritual force to lighten the burden and also using it to push on the shield on his back..... Luo Feng is moving much faster than he would if he was empty handed.\"Hu~~\"Sprint! Sprint as fast as you can! Don't stop sprinting!\"I need to leave the scene as fast as possible. With Li Wei's background, once he dies, his family will probably have some special type of advanced technology to notify them! When that happens, they might use a satellite to investigate the scene! If they find me, then I'll be in trouble\"Luo Feng doesn't know much about satellites, and he doesn't know how they work either.But when the wargod 'Lu Gang' died, the satellite recorded the rat tide explosion. Quite a few people observed the recording through special means.\"After they find out about Li Wei's death and find the spot where he died, they'll use a satellite to investigate..... all of these steps will certainly take time. What I need to do now is get as far away as possible as fast as possible. And running in the grassy fields should make it harder for the satellite to discover me\" Luo Feng ran with his eyes red. Without his spiritual force, it'll be impossible for Luo Feng to sprint faster than 100 m/s.But now, his speed was around 150 m/s.150 m/s, which is near 900 meters every 6 seconds. That'll be 9 km every minute! 45 km in 5 minutes!This speed is extremely horrifying. Usually, only 'intermediate warlords' can achieve such a speed.However, Luo Feng didn't dare to take any chances.....He'll never forget the time where two great wargods came to save the thunderbolt squad when they were surrounded by a monster horde. This shows how big Li Wei's background was.\"Thankfully, I'm a member of the Dojo of Limits\"\"Well, it's too late to regret it now! My parents and brother are all living in the fighter sector of the Dojo of Limits anyway\" Luo Feng has never worried about the safety of his family..... since if the fighters of the world join the Thunder Dojo or the Dojo of Limits, the safety of their families is guaranteed after moving to the respective Dojo's 'fighter sectors'.There was once a case of the 'Blood Blade'.'Blood Blade' was an advanced level wargod who had a grudge against 'Fang You', one of the fighters in the Dojo of Limits. However, 'Fang You' has long passed away in the wilderness, so the powerful 'Blood Blade' took his anger out on all of Fang You's family: relatives, parents, children, nephews, nieces, and grandchildren......All of them were killed!Immediately, the public was enraged! Note that fighters frequently pass away in the wilderness. The family these fighters leave behind are always protected by all the fighters in their Dojo! Because nobody knows who will die and who will live, so naturally, everybody works together to protect each other's families.So\u04bb\u04bbwhoever dared to lay a hand on a member of the dojo's family, becomes the enemy of the entire dojo!Once the news of Fang You's families' death spread around, all the fighters in the Dojo of Limits around the world enraged!A fighter's family is something you should never touch!If you kill them, you become enemies with all the fighters in that dojo!After that, the world's strongest fighter, 'Hong', personally appeared to investigate the matter. After finding out that the murderer was 'Blood Blade', he used all of the information networks in not only all the governments of the world, but also the HR alliance to search for the advanced level wargod fighter who fled to the wilderness. After that, an investigator whose authority was only below 'Hong', the chief instructor of the world headquarters of the Dojo of Limits, was sent out. This person was also an existence that surpassed the wargod level!This investigator brought a staggering 36 wargods with him to hunt down 'Blood Blade'!In the end, Blood Blade killed himself. He was probably afraid of being caught and tortured!After that incident.....The creators of the two largest Dojos, the 'Dojo of Limits' and the 'Thunder Dojo'\u04bb\u04bbHong and Thunder God even hosted and broadcasted around the world the memorial meeting for Fang You's family. These two absolute strongest fighters also expressed their anger in this memorial meeting!Whoever dares to touch a fighter's family is declaring war against all the fighters in the Dojo of Limits and the Thunder Dojo.And in this memorial meeting, representatives have been sent out from each headquarter cities in the five countries of the world and even from the HR alliance to respond to these two strongest fighters! From then on..... nobody dared to harm a fighter's family!Every country has made it the law to prohibit fighters from killing each other. But as everyone knows, nobody can control what goes on in the wilderness. Also, fighters frequently fight on the border of life and death, so once they have a grudge, it'll be normal for them to kill each other. So the killings between fighters..... every organization can only keep pretend to ignore it, unless someone has enough evidence like a video.Only then, will the dojo or government take action.Or else, they wouldn't deal with it.However..... if a grudge between two fighters start to affect their families, then they are dragging in all the powers of the entire world into the conflict!\"Let's enter #023 city\" Luo Feng charged from the highway to the closeset city, #023 city. He was finally able to let out a sigh of relief when he arrived.This #023 city is what was called 'Suzhou city' from before the Grand Nirvana period.\"This city is big, so there are probably a lot of fighters here. I don't want to attract a lot of attention while I'm here\" thought Luo Feng to himself.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdNight.On the highway, blood was splattered onto the bus on the side. The corpses of the four members of the thunderbolt squad were also on the ground.Ten seconds after the mixed youth, Li Wei, died.\"BEEP!\" An area near the chest on the battle uniform of Li Wei's headless corpse immediately sent out a signal!Jiang-Nan headquarter city, main city area. In a small sector called 'Jiang Nan mountain water' that was ranked #2 out of the six most extravagant sectors in China and ranked #1 in Jiang-Nan city.Jiang-Nan mountain water sector.In the most extravagant area of the entire main city area were some preserved mountains and rivers. When Jiang-Nan headquarter city was first built, many of the mountains and hills had to be leveled in order to make room for the dense population. The mountains and hills were removed and replaced with many tall residential buildings. Only in this sector, which took up several miles, did these beautiful mountains exist. There were even man-made waterfalls and lakes, making this the place where countless high ranking government officials and rich people wished to live.You can't get into this place with just money. You can't get into this place with just power!In all of China, there are six headquarter cities!In these six headquarter cities, beautiful sectors like these aren't common. And this sector ranks first in Jiang-Nan headquarter city and ranks two in all of China.In Jiang-Nan mountain water sector, a villa on the peak of Marvelous Mountain.The misty starlight encapsulated the entire peak of the mountain. \"HUAHUA~~\" the sound of a waterfall carried from far away. On the balcony of the villa on the peak of the mountain was a person wearing a loose, deep blue uniform and sitting with his legs crossed. His cold face looked like a sculpted rock and, even though his eyes were closed, one could feel his cold aura emanating from him.His entire body gave off a heart chilling feeling!He was one of the strongest fighters on the entire earth, an advanced wargod 'Li Yao' whose nickname was 'Vulture'!\"BEEP BEEP!\" An ear piercing sound suddenly came from a seemingly regular looking watch on his wrist.\"Hm?\" Li Yao suddenly ferociously opened his eyes, which flashed like lightning.\"Wei!\" Li Yao's sculpture-like cold face suddenly let out a face of surprisement and rage.\"Contact Wei's two bodyguards\" Li Yao commanded his watch. His watch was one of the most advanced products of the HR alliance, which is currently not sold on the market.\"The two bodyguards died too?\" a faintly glowing light could be seen in Li Yao's eyes.Whoosh!Li Yao instantly transformed into a shadow as he directly rushed into the third floor of the villa. This third floor had dozens of rooms, one of which was a large auditorium. The hazy shadow came together and stood in the auditorium.\"Turn on! Enter fighter search mode!\"With Li Yao's command, a gigantic apparatus on the side of the auditorium shot out a misty light, which focused in the center of the auditorium and became a 3D hologram.\"Mr. Li Yao\"All that could be seen in the 3D hologram was a person, who was an old man wearing a black suit. This black suit wearing old man was looking at Li Yao.Actually, right when the 3D hologram was formed, the apparatus projecting the hologram also recorded Li Yao, which was then projected into another target in the auditorium.\"Confirm the location of my son Li Wei\" all that could be seen on Li Yao's face was haste, \"Search for the positions of all the wargods in a 100 mile radius of his position.\"There are no wargods within a 100 mile radius of Li Wei's position\" said the black suit wearing old man.\"How is that possible? Not even half a minute has passed yet\" Li Wei's face changed dramatically.With the device in his son's battle uniform, it'll send a signal 10 seconds after it detects the heart stops beating. From then until Li Yao began his search, not even 30 seconds has passed. Even if a wargod runs past the speed of sound at a speed of 400 m/s, that isn't even 30 miles yet. So how come nothing could be found?To Li Yao, only a wargod level fighter could kill his son's two advanced level warlord bodyguards so quickly that they didn't even have the chance to report.\"How can this be.....\"Li Yao didn't dare to hesitate and immediately commanded, \"Search for all the advanced level warlord fighters within 100 miles!\"\"Searching for wargods is a privilege granted through membership of the Palace of Wargods. Searching for warlords..... needs an S rank member of the underground alliance\" said the black suit wearing old man. The HR alliance has a way to find out the positions of all warrior and warlord level fighters. However, the way the HR alliance uses to find them is a bit sneaky!The 'tactical communications watch' they sell have a secret to them.Since the tactical communications watch is able to perform various functions like transferring money to another person's bank account, it's connected to their respective fighter's fighter card and identification number! Through the tactical communications watch, they can naturally pinpoint anyone's location.However, they wouldn't dare to reveal this secret! Once they reveal it, millions of fighters will start to boycott their things. Even though they're the only power that currently sells tactical communication watches, they didn't dare to enrage the public. So...... only an S rank member of the underground alliance is allowed to use this function to search for fighters lower than the wargod level.Only the highest of highest ranking members in the underground alliance have the authority to do that.And advanced level wargod 'Li Yao' did not have such authority.\"BOOM!\" an explosion carried from far away.A shadow instantly charged into the auditorium, a white, blond haired lady. However, her delicate face was a bit twisted and her dress was a bit ruined under her extreme sprinting..... she was previously attending a banquet and, like Li Yao, received news of her son's death.\"Yao!\" this elegant lady's eyes were red.\"We can search now right\" Li Yao stared at the 'black suit wearing old man' in the 3D hologram. However, the black suit wearing old man was looking at the elegant lady.This lady was the blood sister of the current director of the Paulinus family, one of the nine core families of the HR alliance. At the same time, she was also the advanced level wargod Venina\ufffd\ufffdPaulinus, nickname 'Scorpion'. As of now, she's the director of HR alliance's Huaxia sector.She ranks 3 in the members of the HR alliance in China, so she is an S rank member.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the center of the map was a red dot, which represented Li Wei's location.Six light dots appeared within a 100 mile radius of Li Wei's location, \"There are six advanced level warlord level fighters within a 100 mile radius!\"\"Investigate each of them, and display each of their distances from Li Wei\" coldly commanded Li Yao.BEEP BEEP~ The hologram slightly vibrated twice, and both holograms started to display a huge amount of information.\"Six advanced level warlords, other than Wei's two bodyguards, the other four are in #003 city?\" Li Yao's face was extremely unhappy. He only has four suspects, since the other two are dead already, \"Out of these four, the closest one is 20 miles away. WIth an advanced level warlord's speed, it's pretty much impossible for him to run 20 miles away within a minute\".\"Yao! Just who killed Wei?\" the blond haired lady's Chinese had a bit of an accent, but it was still quite fluent.\"Search for all the intermediate warlords! All the beginner warlords!\" said Li Yao as he clenched his teeth.\"How can they be an intermediate or beginner level warlord?\" the blond haired lady's face was also full of nervousness, \"With Ka Long and the other's strength, how can they die to an intermediate or a beginner level warlord without even having the chance to report?\"\"Shut up!\" LI Yao couldn't help but to scold.The blond haired lady held in her objections.\"Within a 100 mile radius, there are 21 intermediate level warlords\" answered the black suit wearing old man. On the holographic map, 21 lights that were a bit dimmer than the others appeared, \"There are 21 beginner level warlords within a 100 mile radius\". Once again, dots representing the low level warlord level fighters appeared on the map.Li Yao's words seemed to barely be able to squeeze past his teeth: \"Record all the information on these fighters, including their distance to Li Wei! Also, search for all the warrior level fighters and record their information too.After that, send it to me and Venina\".\"Yes\" the black suit wearing old man bowed respectfully.Li Yao glanced at the huge amounts of flashing dots on the map. They were dense and almost uncountable. Clearly, compared to warlord leveled fighters..... there were at least 10 times more warrior level fighters! These hundreds of flashing dots were quite bright.And one of these hundreds of flashing dots, was Luo Feng's!Even though Luo Feng has the skill of a beginner level warlord, according to his battle record and information on his fighter card, he's still an 'advanced level warrior'.\"Use their battle records to determine their rank! And activate the satellite to record Li Wei's position!\" interrupted Venina.\"Because of the weather, the recording won't be too good.As for the recording, our professionals will enhance it. We'll send it in half an hour\" said the black suit wearing old man. Actually, satellite recording isn't as amazing as regular people think it is.There are many restrictions.One of the major ones is weather, which has an enormous effect on the recording quality.\"Mr. Li Yao, director Venina, there are 8 advanced level warlords, 21 intermediate level warlords, and hundreds of beginner level warlords and soldier level fighters.All the information has been sent.\" said the black suit wearing old man.Li Yao and Venina lowered their heads.The photos and information of various fighters flashed across their watches, and one of them was Luo Feng! Of course, as a warrior level fighter, he didn't stand out at all.After just three minutes.On top of the starlight covered mountain peak, two blue UFO shaped fighter aircraft flew up and soared through the sky.\"BEEP!\"\"Signal read, pass\"Only after that were the two blue UFO shaped fighter aircraft able to leave the city's defense system.If their signal wasn't read and they tried to fly out, the two fighter aircraft would've been instantly shot through by lasers and engulfed in flames.In the cockpit.Li Yao and Venina both had their battle uniform sets on.Each of them had their own weapons, and their faces were extremely unamused. The pilot of the aircraft and the other six wargod subordinates didn't dare to make a sound.They knew...... that something terrible has happened. The only son of the husband-wife duo nicknamed 'Vulture' and 'Scorpion' has been killed! This couple isn't normal at all. Whether in the circle of wargods or in underground alliance's community, both of them have an extraordinary amount of influence and power.\"Yao, could a monster horde leader have killed them?\" said Venina as she frowned.\"How could a monster horde leader appear on the highway? And even if they did encounter one, how could they not have the chance to send a message?\" The muscles on Li Yao's faces started twitching as the cold light in his eyes flashed. As if he just lost everything to him, he's become cold and enraged like a lone wolf, \"I've already told Wang Tong at the city to go and check the scene. When he gets there, we'll have a general idea of what happened\"\"Okay\" Venina slightly nodded.Deep into the winter night, the winter wind was chilling. On the highway, the four corpses have long turned dark red. One tall and one skinny, short shadow was carefully investigating the scene under Li Yao's request. These two were precisely the two great wargods Wang Tong and Li Kan who rushed from the city.\"Whoosh!\" \"Whoosh!\"Two eerie blue lights flew from the faraway horizon and quickly arrived on the highway as they slowly descended. \"Hua!\" Not waiting for the fighter aircraft to descend, one of the fighter aircraft's hatches was opened and two shadows came jumping down from the air. They were precisely Li Yao and Venina! Vulture, Scorpion, Shadow Blade, and Bear Strength, these four have teamed up quite a few times.Wargods helping each other is a very common occurrence.\"Vulture, I'm sorry\" sighed Wang Tong.\"What's the conclusion?\" Li Yao attempted be more polite, but it was clearly filled with rage.Wang Tong didn't bother arguing over Li Yao's tone and pointed to the for corpses: \"All I can say..... it kind of seems like the work of a spirit reader!\"\"Spirit reader?\" Li Yao and Venina both frowned.\"Of course, the possibility remains that the enemy purposefully made it look that way so he wouldn't be suspected\" added Wang Tong.At this time, a few figher bodyguards jumped from one of the blue fighter aircraft. And five people wearing dark gray uniforms jumped from the other fighter aircraft, all of them carrying some sort of machine on their backs. There were two females, one Asian and one white man out of these five.There was also a pale old man.\"Nobody else is allowed at the scene\" commanded the old man.\"Begin\"The other four suddenly opened the things they had on their back and pulled out all sorts of sensors and detectors as they started to investigate the scene as closely as possible.Time passed a second at a time.Li Yao and Venina could only wait silently. Wang Tong and Li Kan exchanged glances, both of them not knowing what to say.The Vulture and the Scorpion are extremely famous throughout the entire world. Other than the existences that have surpassed the wargod level, there's virtually nobody that can suppress this couple.And with their already cruel personalities, would they not avenge their only son's death?\"Mr and Mrs.\" bowed the pale old man respectfully, \"We already have results, please come see them\"Li Yao and Venina, and even Wang Tong and Li Kan walked over.A notebook was there with a simulation already on the screen. The pale old man said, \"This old fighter and white fighter probably died in an instant. They died the exact same way: something pierced their heads from behind! This middle aged fighter and young master Li Wei also died at around the same time.The white fighter died a little later than the old fighter\" as he said that, the old pale man tapped the simulation screen.Suddenly, the simulation began.....The only thing that could be seen were two lights that seemed to have pierced the heads of the old veteran named Liu and the white brute. After that, two lights shot through Pan Ya and young master Li Wei, cutting off their heads.\"Yea\" nodded Wang Tong, \"I've also checked. The old fighter and the white fighter probably haven't been able to respond when they died.As for Li Wei and the middle aged man, their eyes were filled with horror...... clearly, they witnessed the scene\".The pale old man continued, \"We have investigated the surroundings and are 100% sure that no horde leaders have passed by\".\"Using the footprints around the surroundings and the position of the victim's legs, this old fighter, white fighter, and middle aged fighter were probably charging towards the same point! Which was why they weren't able to respond to an attack from behind\" the pale old man tapped the screen and a figure of a man appeared.Li Yao and Venina were both squatting beside Li Yao's body. Li Wei's head and body were already connected, and his eyes were clearly still in shock.\"I've checked! After 30 seconds of Wei's death, no wargod was within 100 miles!\"\"One minute after Wei's death, there were four advanced level warlords, the closest one being 25 miles away!\" said Li Yao deeply, \"So..... the killer must've hid his strength!\"A person's strength is determined by their battle record.Even though some extremely powerful men have killed extremely powerful monsters, they gave all the credit to their allies. Without a battle record, their skill ranking would naturally be low.\"That's one possibility! The killer is a regular fighter with an average battle record whose actual strength is that of a wargod's! Second possibility! The killer is a spirit reader who has hid his identity of a spirit reader. A spirit reader is two levels above his fitness level..... so this person could be a beginner or intermediate level warlord.Of course, we aren't ignoring the possibility that this person is really good at hiding his skill and only appears as a warrior level fighter! said Li Yao lowly.\"There's still a third possibility, the killer is one of my enemies, a powerful wargod fighter! He isn't wearing a tactical communications watch, so I can't find him\". Wargods usually share their information frequently, so quite a few of them know about the secret behind the tactical communication watches. They're just too lazy to tell anyone else.When they're executing top secret missions, they don't wear their tactical communication watches.Silence.Beside Li Wei's corpse, only Li Yao spoke. Venina's eyes were both wet with tears, and Wang Tong and Li Kan kept their distance.\"No matter who, I'll never forgive the person who killed my son!!!\"\"Spread the news of Wei's death around the world and let every single fighter know\" seethed Venina, \"I, Venina\ufffd\ufffdPaulinus, will give all my earnings of this year, a bounty of 100 billion, to anyone who can find out who killed my son with enough proof!\"\"I don't believe that this person doesn't have family or friends! As long as he tells this to someone, as long as he even utters a single word in his dreams or while drunk, as long as he accidentally lets it slip out under any circumstance...... then, even his closest friend might not keep the secret!A bounty of 100 billion! I'll make him unable to ever sleep peacefully again in case he accidentally mutters it! I'll make him unable to ever drink any alcohol again! I'll fill his life with horror and fear!\" seethed Venina.Wang Tong and Li Kan both took a deep breath on the side.100 billion?This gigantic bounty can even mobilize the invincible wargod existences. Know that even a legendary Emperor level monster isn't even worth 100 billion, so this is an astronomical bounty! With this much money, you can instantly enjoy all the fun in the world.All sorts of information networks and powers will search for the killer for the sake of this bounty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHumans can be controlled by money, and a gigantic amount of it can make one go mad.100 billion!\"Pretty cruel\" Li Kan couldn't help but to take in a deep breath.\"Even I'm affected\" sighed Wang Tong as he shook his head, \"Just what you'd expect from the director of the Huaxia sector, blood sister of one of the nine families' Paulinus family's director. The rich are always going to be rich\". Even around the entire world, not many advanced level wargods have such wealth.Yes, hunting horde leader level monsters and selling them is good money, but are horde leader monsters that stupid?They have intelligence equal to that of a human's. Once they sense danger and feel like they have no chance of winning, they'll choose to run away! Once a horde leader level monster decides to run away, it'll definitely command thousands of thousands of monsters to obstruct the wargod's path...... even if they can't obstruct the wargod, it'll definitely slow them down.So killing a horde leader level monster is extremely difficult! The stronger they are, the harder it becomes. So the usual situation is, 'an advanced level wargod hunts a medium level horde leader', 'an intermediate level wargod hunts a low level horde leader', and 'a beginner level wargod hunts a high level commander'. The chances of success are higher this way.For example, Wang Tong and Li Kan's attempt to hunt the 'steel armored dragon' ended in failure.And the amount of monsters isn't limitless. The stronger the monster, the fewer there are! For example, when Luo Feng and the others of the fire hammer squad were in that small sector and hunted large amounts of commander level monsters, it became significantly harder to find them later..... because the amount of commander level monsters in that area lowered. But this isn't the worst part, the worst part is\u04bb\u04bb you'll attract the attention of the commander level monsters' leader, the 'horde leader'. The fighters are usually able to discover the danger after killing a lot, so they'll run away. However, this also proves the point that killing monsters to earn money is no easy task. Most importantly...... wargods also have to spend tons of money. Things like weapons and battle uniforms, which one of these things doesn't cost a gigantic amount? A top tier instruction manual also costs so much that it's frightening! Many wargods even have to borrow money from the bank.There's no helping it, wargods need to spend too much money.For example, if an advanced level wargod fights against a 'high level horde leader', then he'll have to buy a 'SS grade battle uniform set' to be safe, since a Q series (S rank) battle uniform can only defend against most S rank horde leaders' attacks, but not all of them.SS grade battle uniform set, SS grade weapon, which one doesn't cost a fortune?A SS grade instruction manual and even ultimate instruction manuals like the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd are just as expensive! To fully equip yourself with the perfect gear, how many 'medium level horde leaders' will you have to kill? This is something that most advanced level wargods won't be able to achieve.And don't even mention the special treasures available in the 'Palace of Wargods': those treasures are even more expensive.It is no lie that many wargods on the entire earth have to borrow money from the bank! Of course, an extremely small amount of wargods are an exception. For example, wargods with special abilities like wargod level 'spirit readers' or wargods with extraordinary skills, or wargods with a huge background! It'll be easy for the sons and daughters of 'Hong' to get money, simply because of the influence of 'Hong'.The HR alliance is the world's top financial group. They control over half of the world's economy and have control in virtually every field.Their wealth is also just as astonishing.Venina\ufffd\ufffdPaulinus is the director of the HR alliance in China and is the blood sister of the man who is both the head of the Paulinus family and a top executive of the HR alliance. Does anyone even need to ask about her wealth? Her wealth mainly comes from her family and the HR alliance, and not from hunting monsters. Even her husband, Li Yao, can't compare to her.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdJiang-Nan headquarter city, Limit Hall.Zhu Ge Tao was wearing a black dojo uniform and sitting cross legged in a training room. As time flowed, the morning light slowly started to shine into the room.\"Hu\" Zhu Ge Tao opened his eyes.\"Open\" as Zhu Ge Tao spoke, the projector projected some light which formed a gigantic display onto the wall. Zhu Ge Tao has a habit: every morning, he'll check the news on T.V to figure out what's going on around the world.The reporter's voice echoed around the training room.\"What?\" Zhu Ge Tao froze as he stared at what the morning news was describing on the display.\"100 billion?\" Zhu Ge Tao blinked twice.100 billion!!! Zhu Ge Tao fiercely stood up as his heart rate increased. This amount of money is too crazy. He, one of the Big Four of Jiang-Nan city's dojo of Limits headquarters, couldn't even control his surprisement.\"Vulture and Scorpion, so it's that couple! Well, makes sense. What kind of normal wargod can bring out 100 billion!\" Zhu Ge Tao was amazed, \"And this news broadcast was directed at the entire population in the country. In other words..... not only fighters, but regular people will know about this too. The HR alliance's influence is sure great, being able to bring out this news on China's television channel\"100 billion, even Zhu Ge Tao is affected! It seems like that he, Zhu Ge Tao, frequently offers some geniuses and powerful fighters many benefits. However, he does most of that with his special privileges in the dojo, so he barely has to take out his own money.\"Enter the Home of Limits, wargod fighter discussion section\" commanded Zhu Ge Tao.The display suddenly and quickly changed as it entered the wargod fighter's discussion section.As an advanced level warlord, he doesn't have the rights. But as his identity as a chief instructor, he's granted access to the section.\"Hmhm, the entire discussion section has indeed become lively. It looks like fighters from South America, North America, Europe, Africa, and other places all have their blood boiling\" laughed Zhu Ge Tao, \"However, this case happened in China, so this gigantic sum of money will probably end up in the hands of a Chinese\"\"100 billion is just like throwing a fat sheep into a pack of wolves\"Indeed, the entire world has been stirred up by this gigantic sum. Even existences surpassing the wargod level have to sigh at this. Since wargods are so moved by this...... don't even mention a regular citizen! Regular citizens are toiling just for their rent; even 100 million is an astronomical number for them. Don't even mention 100 billion.Stirred! The entire world is stirred up! Virtually every information network couldn't help but to start investigating this case: find this person! #023 city was a huge city that contained hundreds of millions of people. #023 city is high risk high reward, so many fighters are attracted there.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdOn the eighth floor of some 12 story residential building in the western section of an old city.\"Huhu\"The crazed winds howled and the snowflakes danced. The chilly air charged into the house incessantly, and the floor of the room was absolutely freezing. Luo Feng sat cross legged on a torn cushion as he lightly polished his throwing knives. The only thing in his mind was the astonishing news his tactical communications watch just received: the news of the astronomical bounty.\"I can't believe they're spending so much money on my bounty. Even I feel like reporting myself\" Luo Feng lightly placed his throwing knife onto the ground, took out another knife, and started polishing it, \"100 billion. However, the parents of Li Wei aren't fools. They'll only give the money to someone who can bring clear and absolute evidence\"Evidence?Luo Feng doesn't think that there's anyone on this earth who has evidence of him killing Li Wei! Back then, to prevent himself from being caught by the satellite, he rushed straight into the fields after killing Li Wei and the others.\"Unless my luck is really that horrible. So horrible that there just happened to be someone hiding next to the highway and happened to record my face and my actions\" but Luo Feng thought that the chance of this is no higher than the chance of fishing up a needle in the sea. Actually, the only thing Luo Feng is afraid of is.....His fire hammer squad comrades!\"This bounty described the identity and skill of the other three people who died with Li Wei. And the bounty even said that the murderer is most likely either someone with the power of a wargod level fighter, or a spirit reader\" Luo Feng's face sank, \"If the captain, Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and brother Chen see this, they'll probably connect this to me!\"Without a doubt, the other four members of the fire hammer squad easily connected this bounty with Luo Feng! First, Luo Feng stayed in #003 city to kill the tiger fang squad. And one of the four people that died was the tiger fang captain, 'Pan Ya'.Next, the bounty itself said that the murderer is either someone with the power of a wargod or a spirit reader! And everyone in the squad knows that he's a spirit reader. Extrapolating with the two points above is indeed very easy.As a matter of fact, this was exactly the case. When this astronomical bounty was revealed, the other four members of the fire hammer squad were stunned as they guessed it was Luo Feng.\"Just because they can guess, doesn't mean they have evidence!\" Luo Feng shook his head.The fire hammer squad guessed it was Luo Feng.And a few wargods guessed that the murderer was a wargod who had a grudge with the Vulture, Scorpion couple! Anyway, all of these are just groundless accusations: not one person had sufficient evidence.\"When Li Wei encountered danger last time, Li Wei's parents instantly found the two closest wargods and asked them for help\" frowned Luo Feng, \"In other words, Li Wei's parents have enough power to instantly find the fighters in a location. If they can find wargods, then warlords and warriors would be even easier to find\"From Luo Feng's point of view.....Locating wargods is much more difficult than locating warlords and warriors!\"They'll probably find out that I wasn't too far from the scene at the time\" frowned Luo Feng.This point is extremely disadvantageous! Actually, Luo Feng didn't know that wargods can locate other wargods through a system in the palace of wargods. Most wargods definitely can't locate other warlords and warriors. However, Luo Feng's blind guess hit the mark, since Li Wei's parents did indeed locate the hundreds of people around the area.And he, Luo Feng, was one of them!\"I'm probably one of the suspects, but since I'm weak, the chances of being caught should be quite low\" frowned Luo Feng, \"However, captain, brother Tie, brother Qing, and brother Chen... if one of them reveals the fact that I stayed in #003 city to kill the tiger fang squad and the fact that I'm a spirit reader..... then, even though it's not pure evidence, Li Wei's parents will definitely make me into the 'number one suspect'\"Suddenly, Luo Feng felt a vibration on his wrist.He lowered his head and looked at the display on his tactical communications watch.\"A phone call from captain Gao Feng?\" Luo Feng slightly frowned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After taking a deep breath, he lightly said: \"Redial!\"Beep.....beep.....beep.....\"Hello, Luo Feng\" Captain Gao Feng's voice carried over.\"Captain, something happening?\" said Luo Feng as he laughed.Gao Feng's voice immediately sank: \"I'm sure you saw that astronomical bounty, that's a whole 100 billion, definitely enough to make countless fighters go crazy. Especially since the notice said..... the murderer is a fighter with either wargod level strength or a spirit reader! No matter what, you must not reveal your identity as a spirit reader, or else you'll bring upon yourself huge trouble..... since our fire hammer squad and the tiger fang squad were already in conflict, and one of the four people that died was the tiger fang captain Pan Ya, you'll easily come under suspect once people find out that you're a spirit reader. When that happens, you'll become the target of thousands of thousands of people. No matter how careful you are, the unexpected could always happen\"\"I understand. But since I didn't do it, there's nothing for me to be afraid of. However, captain, this murderer is pretty strong; he was able to make these four die before any of them were able to contact that couple. He sure is powerful\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to compliment.\"He is indeed strong\" Gao Feng also gave his compliments.Luo Feng continued: \"And since Pan Ya died, this is also great news. Our fire hammer squad won't have to deal with any troubles in the future\"\"Indeed, this is quite beneficial to us. I'm just going to remind you again. Be careful, careful, and even more careful! This case has too much riding on it. I'll remind Chen Gu and the others when I get back. Don't worry...... if any of them dare to reveal anything, I won't spare them\"\"Oh yea, when are you returning to the headquarter city? The materials of the monsters we hunted are still stored there and we're waiting for you to return to decide how to deal with them\"Luo Feng smiled: \"I was going to stay in the wilderness for a bit longer, but since the tiger fang captain is dead, I don't have any more business. I'll return within two days\"\"Okay, I'll see you then\" Gao Feng's voice carried from the tactical communications watch.\"See you later\"Luo Feng hung up and his expression immediately became serious.From this phone call, it seemed like the captain was seriously passionate about reminding him. After hearing the captain's words, his heart was indeed warmed. However, one thing can be discovered after thinking this through\u04bb\u04bbthe other four members of the fire hammer squad could suspect him.However, none of the four have sufficient evidence! What can the four of them do for Luo Feng's trust?\"The best way for me to trust them is if none of them call me. If they don't call me, then they won't be able to find any evidence\" Luo Feng frowned, \"But the captain called me and seemed like he was comforting me..... if I wasn't careful, along with the pressure brought along by the 100 billion, I might get hot headed and reveal everything to someone I care about\"After Luo Feng thought about that, he couldn't help but to be afraid! Indeed, a youth who hasn't even reached the age of 20 just killed an important person and received an 'astronomical bounty'. Most people would be extremely nervous. Deep relationships with their seniors would easily move them and they might get hot headed and let all the secrets out!\"Using all sorts of ways to ask me actually makes me more cautious instead. And this concern easily makes people drop their guard. Once I reveal the secret, it might get recorded if the captain was using a recording device\" Luo Feng took in a deep breath, \"With the information that I was hunting down the tiger fang squad and my identity as a spirit reader, along with the fact that Li Wei's parents are sure that I was one of the fighters nearby... and finally, along with the recording...\"How can there be so many coincidences? With this much evidence, the murderer's identity is practically 100% confirmed.Luo Feng took in a deep breath..... indeed, if he admitted the fact with his own mouth, then he'll be in huge trouble.Thankfully, he's been under pressure ever since he was young. He worked and worked to become a fighter. After long periods of stress, he's able to handle much more than a regular 20 year old youth.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdTime flowed slowly, and yet the snow started falling faster and faster, causing everything within sight to be covered in pure white. At the same time, the temperature has dropped to an astonishing level. Soon enough, the time reached midnight.In the dirty, little room.Luo Feng sat cross legged: \"I received a total two phone calls today! One from the captain and one from Wei Qing. The captain seemed to be extremely comforting while Wei Qing seemed to be in complete shock\". Earlier in the afternoon, the first thing Wei Qing said when he called was\u04bb\u04bb \"Damn, Crazy, the captain just told us to be careful not to reveal your identity as a spirit reader. You didn't kill those four did you?\"Wei Qing and Gao Feng's phone calls rose Luo Feng's suspicions.Of course, only suspicions! Maybe the captain was truly being considerate, and maybe Wei Qing only talked like that because he truly thought of him as a brother.\"Humans are the hardest to read, since they're so unpredictable\"\"In the face of money, brothers turn on each other, couples divorce, parents and children cut ties..... I've seen these types of things on the internet way too many times! And needless to say, this is a gigantic sum of 100 billion!\" through his tactical communications watch, Luo Feng entered the internet and looked at some discussion boards.And he soon discovered how crazy the entire world was going over this bounty.The night was even colder than the day.Luo Feng was curled up in a corner, but his heart was a bit cold. Ever since he started suspecting captain Gao Feng and Wei Qing, Luo Feng's entire attitude started changing..... in the past, he was extremely cheerful and straightforward, just like a regular fighter. He was able to fight in front of the face of death with the other brothers in his squad. He was easily able to treat others as his good brothers.But now..........\"Are they thinking of me as a brother, or are they planning on turning me in for the huge sum of money? Maybe the lack of evidence is the only thing keeping them from doing that\" Luo Feng's gaze was cold.\"What am I thinking!\"\"I'm randomly suspecting them\" Luo Feng shook his head. He finally realized how his attitude couldn't help but to change under the gigantic bounty of 100 billion..... He can't be sure that the others won't be affected by 100 billion, since, after all, this is 100 billion. This is what caused him to change! Even though Luo Feng knows he shouldn't be so suspicious, he can't help himself! One of Venina\ufffd\ufffdPaulinus' goal was already reached..... Luo Feng started spiraling down under all the pressure brought by the 100 billion bounty.\"Nevermind, I'm not going to think about this anymore\"Luo Feng immediately lowered his head and looked at his tactical communications watch. He then lightly pressed the button and started reading through all the different types of messages on the tactical communications watch's screen. Suddenly, he flipped through the phone book and was calmed by one of the names that appeared........ within these names was the good friend that always played with him, 'Wei Wen'.\"I wonder how Wen is doing \" Luo Feng couldn't help but to let out a smile as he thought about the things he did with Wei Wen back in the days.There were quite a few of his high school friends within these names.There were also some friends in the Dojo of Limits.The names of his parents and his brother were here too.\"Dad, mom, brother\" Luo Feng's gaze was soft, \"No matter what, you guys won' be in trouble! I'll definitely overcome this problem\"Suddenly\u04bb\u04bbLuo Feng's gaze landed upon a name\u04bb\u04bb Xu Xin! They exchanged phone numbers back when they chatted in the HR alliance's market. However, he never called her after all this time.\"Dial Xu Xin's number\" said Luo Feng.For some reason, he started to get nervous after dialing the number...... maybe his identity as the murderer will be revealed one day. When that happens, the Xu family definitely won't allow Xu Xin to have any contact with him.\"Hello\" Xu Xin's voice carried from the tactical communications watch, \"Is this Luo Feng?\"\"Yep, it's me\" Luo Feng's heart warmed.\"How rare, a big time fighter like you thought of calling me\" mockingly laughed Xu Xin, \"What, returned to the headquarter city?\"\"I'm in the wilderness and it's night time and I'm bored, so.....\" after Luo Feng said this, he suddenly felt a bit awkward.Bored during the night?How come this sounds like he's trying to get a hooker; finding women when he's bored during the night.\"*Cough*\" Xu Xin coughed a bit, \"I never knew even you were so 'playful'\"\"'Playful'? Uh...... how's college for you right now. As someone who never went to college, I'm quite curious\"Luo Feng immediately changed the topic and the two continued to chat like this. Maybe because it's the first time they chatted over phone, or maybe because they're both bored in the quiet night, so they chatted for a long time.Only until he hung up did Luo Feng realize..... this phone call lasted for 1.5 hours.\"I never knew that chatting over the phone could last for 1.5 hours\" Luo Feng's heart was filled with happiness. Indeed, chatting with your crush for 1.5 hours over the phone can make one really happy.All the fear previously brought by the 100 billion bounty and all the negative emotions were.....Completely swept away! The previously nervous, panicking person changed back to the little boy in love..... this change in attitude washed Luo Feng's spirit.Luo Feng steadily started to calm down.This was a peacefulness he never felt before, a peacefulness brought by a gigantic change in attitude. Well indeed, how many normal people go through such huge changes in attitude?His heart was peaceful and still like water! \"This feeling feels so great\" Luo Feng really enjoyed this feeling that he never had before. And at this time, he had an urge\u04bb\u04bb the urge to practice his blade technique! Hu! He pulled out the shadow blade from the sheathe on his back.In this deep, cold night, while countless people were stunned over the astronomical bounty, Luo Feng was swinging his blade and practicing his \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd in the room of an abandoned building in the wilderness' #003 city with unforeseen peacefulness. Each swing of the blade gave him comfort he never felt before.One swing... two swings...Luo Feng's spiritual force naturally spread out, and the slight movements the swings imposed onto the surrounding area were clearly checked by the spiritual force.The cold light, like snow, slowly floated around the room.-Back from Europe! Next chapter will either come out today or tomorrow (probably tomorrow). After that, chapters will be every other day. I thought I could release one a day but I'm unexpectedly busy..... or maybe I could release double chapters every so often, but we'll have to see how things turn out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter going through a gigantic change in emotion, his current state of mind was crystal clear, for now at least.Without a second thought, his entire body and mind was focused on his blade.\"Hm?\" after practicing for a bit, Luo Feng frowned and thought to himself as he tested some swings. After that, he would then again return to practicing, pause and think for a bit, and then practice again.....The overall feeling of this was like Luo Feng's experience of solving math problems while he was still enrolled in school.To solve a really difficult math problem, you would have to try several different ways. With the information you know, you would continuously fix up your attempts..... until you solve it. The big math problems on the high school tests are super difficult. Sometimes, you can't solve them by just putting in one or two hours.And now, Luo Feng studied his blade technique like he was solving a math problem! However, unlike usual, Luo Feng's current state of mind caused his brain to work much faster than before and allowed him to clearly control even the most obscure parts of his body.One night of hard work. The morning of the second day was still filled with hard work.In the afternoon of the second day, Luo Feng was deep in thought as he was holding his ghost blade and sitting on the balcony. He continued to sit there for three hours.Luo Feng continued to study his blade technique and, as a result, forgot to eat, forgot all about the astronomical bounty, and forgot about all of his suspicions.Late into the night of the second day, Luo Feng continued to swing his blade in the dark living room on the 8th floor of this residential building! The blade's cold light completely chilled one's heart.Hu! Who knows how many times he has swung his blade by now, but this time, just a slight movement of the ghost blade caused a silver flash to brighten up the entire living room. There was a slight, odd vibration hidden in that light. Like a flash of lightning, the surrounding air caused a shockwave similar to a sonic boom with a \"PUPU~\" sound.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng's eyes widened in astonishment.\"It worked?\"\"I actually completed it! I finally finished the the third stage of the\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd!\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to let out a shout of excitement and happiness.The third stage of the thunder blade! Completed not too long after the announcement of the astronomical bounty.\"Each stage of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd gets harder and harder, and I just successfully completed the second stage not too long ago. Who would've thought that I could finish the third stage so soon!\" Luo Feng let out a smile, \"Indeed, I'll have to thank Li Wei's parents\". If Li Wei's mother, Venina\ufffd\ufffdPaulinus, knew that this happened, she'll probably spit out blood from anger.The\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdgets progressively harder! The only person able to complete all nine stages on this earth is 'Thunder God' alone.This ultimate technique is extremely messed up.The third stage is your strength multiplied by 28! Luo Feng's current fitness level places him at the advanced warrior level. Multiply that by 28, and his attack power rivals an intermediate level warlord's! 28! Keep in mind that one level only differs by around a multiple of two.\"My one blade, along with four exertions of force, rivals an intermediate warlord. If my spiritual force assists my ghost blade and adds a fifth or sixth force exertion..... my blade might rival an advanced level warlord!\" Luo Feng clearly understood the power of his spiritual force. If you combine the spiritual force with your attacks, its power will stand out even more.Surprise! An unexpected surprise brought about by the astronomical bounty! The astronomical bounty indeed put Luo Feng under huge stress. Some people could even collapse under this pressure. But some people would work even harder under this stress and improve at an astounding rate.And Luo Feng received improvement! \"I have to thank Li Wei's parents\" Luo Feng's face was full of happiness, \"That 'astronomical bounty' indeed spawned fear in the bottom of my heart and made me feel like anyone could betray me. Thankfully, I became happy after chatting with Xu Xin..... this gigantic change made me extraordinarily calm\"His heart was still like water, in other words, not even the tiniest bit of distractions existed! This extreme level of calmness is very difficult to maintain over long periods of time.Usually, an ordinary person could occasionally enter this state when his life is in danger or during an emergency. During that time, their skill will explode pass their usual limits! For example, Luo Feng, who was absolutely calm and had no hesitations at all, managed to escape from being surrounded by hundreds of commander level monsters at the family mart super market in just a short 12 seconds.However, that state can usually be maintained for just one or two minutes.However, with this gigantic change in attitude, he managed to stay in that state for over 20 hours! In these 20 hours of blade training, he managed to complete the third stage of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd! At the end, it was because of his intense joy that caused him escape the state he was in.\"The astronomical bounty..... sure did affect me. According to the history books, most of the falls of any ancient emperor were caused by their suspicions of their ministers; their suspicions made them ill and therefore led to their death\" Luo Feng's mental state also went up by another level.The astronomical bounty also has very little effect on him now.\"The captain and the others have no evidence. Without any evidence, naturally, they won't be able to receive the bounty. If they can't receive the bounty, then why would they report anything?\" Luo Feng's ears slightly moved, and then he rushed towards the balcony and looked below. Below this residential apartment were dozens of monsters gathering towards the building.Luo Feng froze, and then laughed: \"Looks like my howl from completing the third stage attracted quite a bit of monsters\"\"Right now, it's time for me to return to the headquarter city!\" After Luo Feng picked up his bag, blade, and shield, he directly jumped off the balcony of the 8th floor with a lightning-like leap and fell onto the roof of a three story apartment building nearby. After that, he disappeared with a shake of his body.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe train station.The train station is always the most crowded place, crowded to the point where it's absurd. The endless chattering spread around the area. A long train slowly entered the train station and, as the ear-piercing brakes of the train came from the tracks, the doors of the train opened. The large amount of passengers, like sardines stuffed in a can, came out.\"The headquarter city, now this is home\" Luo Feng walked out of the train's doors and smiled as he looked around.\"I'm back!\"After riding on the private car of the Dojo of Limits, Luo Feng returned to the Ming-Yue sector after the sun has set.\"This small sector is still the same as always, quiet as usual\" through the window, Luo Feng saw the large amounts of residents chatting and relaxing in the small sector.\"Beep!\" the car stopped in front of the Limit Hall.Luo Feng opened the door of the car and walked out. A large group of people could be seen standing in front of the entrance of the Limit Hall: there were quite a bit of fighters with their families, and even some of the people from the fire hammer squad. Of course, his brother and parents were here too.\"Feng\" Luo Hong Guo and Gong Xin Lan couldn't help but to yell.\"Bro\" Luo Hua's face was full of happiness.\"Papa Feng\"\"Captain Crazy\"Quite a few fighters also yelled passionately.\"Captain, you guys are here too?\" Luo Feng laughed and said with a tone of surprisement. Captain Gao Feng, Wei Tie, and Wei Qing also laughed as Gao Feng said: \"Didn't you tell us you'll be returning these two days. We need to deal with the monster materials we have anyway. Furthermore, we haven't seen old Zhang for a while, so us brothers can meet up and have a chat\"Luo Feng smiled as he nodded: \"Captain, I'll chat with you guys later tonight, I'm gonna go back first\"\"Alright\" Gao Feng smiled as he nodded and watched Luo Feng leave. He thought to himself in his heart: \"Hm? Looking at Luo Feng's face and attitude, it seems like he's quite happy and relaxed and is under absolutely no pressure at all. The culprit might actually not be him\". Even Gao Feng himself didn't know what his own thoughts were now.He couldn't help but to want to investigate and find out whether or not Luo Feng was the culprit, since the attraction of 100 billion was just too great. He didn't want Luo Feng to be the culprit so his heart could be at ease. How many people on this earth can be not only absolutely worry-free, but also happy under the pressure of the astronomical bounty? At least, it'll be difficult for a young man who hasn't even reached the age of 20 to do such a thing.Gao Feng shook his head, \"Whatever, I'm not going to think about this anymore\". Gao Feng had to admit, even he was a bit thrown off by the large sum of money.\"Let's go, us brothers will have a drink\" shouted Gao Feng.\"Go\"\"Haha, let's go together\"The members of the fire hammer squad, including handicapped Zhang Ke, walked into the Limit Hall. Only Luo Feng was in his home.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe second floor of Luo Feng's home.After he returned home, Luo Feng placed the bag containing the valuable blade, battle uniform, and dragon egg into his own personal safe in his room. Actually, even if he placed it on the floor, nobody would steal it. This is the fighter sector of the Dojo of Limits; nobody would dare to come here to steal things.\"Without a doubt, Li Wei's parents have the right to find the fighters in an area. With the number of fighters gathered at the edge of #003 city, they probably searched over thousands of fighters. Since I'm just one of them, the chances of me being suspected are low\"\"Li Wei's parents are already suspecting spirit readers, so they might look into the profiles and bank accounts of fighters they suspect\"\"Because of that, from now on!\"\"I can't deposit large amounts of money into the bank account that's under my real name. I should put the money into an account that doesn't require a name\". As of now, many banks on earth support 'nameless accounts'. These accounts don't care about the person's identity: you just have to set some passwords and then you're set!\"One, large amounts of money can't go into my real bank account\"\"Two, until the right time, my identity as a spirit reader can't be revealed\"\"Three, I can't tell anybody the fact that I killed Li Wei\"\"Four, I also can't tell anybody about the dragon egg and the wargod battle gear, including my family\" Luo Feng was clear, that even the tiniest action could ruin everything. So, before he has enough strength to go against the Vulture, Scorpion couple in the open, he definitely can't reveal anything! For a warlord level fighter, having hundreds of millions to even around a billion isn't too over the top.But if their bank account has over tens of billions, how could Vulture, 'Li Yao', and Scorpion, 'Venina\ufffd\ufffdPaulinus', not get suspicious? Keep in mind that the HR alliance controls over half of the world's economy. Many large banks are under the flag of the HR alliance: with their authority, they can easily find out Luo Feng's wealth through their global banking network.Only a nameless account is the safest.If even the bank itself doesn't know who owns the account, then don't even talk about investigating.\"For me right now, the most important thing is strength! So I better go and buy some more advanced \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd stages\" Luo Feng slightly nodded. At this time, his cell phone started ringing.\"Hello, Luo Feng, are you ready yet?\"\"I'm ready, I'm coming now\" said Luo Feng as he laughed.\"We're at the bar at the Limit Hall, come here\"After hanging up, Luo Feng headed towards the Limit Hall inside the small sector.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And the people around one of the tables were precisely the members of the fire hammer squad. Soon enough, Luo Feng started walking towards them.\"Hey, Luo Feng\"\"Crazy, you're here?\"All the people in the bar gave their greetings. After Luo Feng smiled as he replied to them, he sat at the fire hammer squad's table. The men at the table were indeed Gao Feng, Wei Tie, Wei Qing, Chen Gu, Luo Feng, and the handicapped Zhang Ke. The six of them sat down together as they drank and chatted, all the way until around 9 PM. They then accompanied Zhang Ke as he left.Only Luo Feng and the other four remained at the table.\"Luo Feng, what do you think we should do with the materials we received this time?\" smiled Gao Feng as he asked.\"I think we should just sell it all for money\" Wei Tie couldn't help but to yell.Luo Feng shook his head: \"Captain, for my portion of the materials, I'm preparing to sell them to the Dojo of Limits to receive some contribution points! Right now, I only have a sad few hundred points; I don't even have a one star contribution rank\". These few hundred points were received when he sold a small portion of the materials he got from crazily hunting around 10,000 soldier level monsters back then.\"Indeed, Luo Feng still doesn't even have a one star contribution rank yet\" nodded Gao Feng.The others couldn't help but to laugh as they nodded.\"Yea, he should get some more contribution points. There are quite a few benefits brought about by having a high amount of contribution points\" laughed Chen Gu as he said, \"For example, you have to buy your own instruction manuals. Only by having enough contribution points can you purchase the instruction manuals at a good price! And only with the saint rank can you enter the special training rooms of the Dojo of Limits\"Luo Feng nodded. Even some large powers can't afford to buy those highly expensive and technologically advanced training rooms.Only gigantic powers like the Dojo of Limits and the Thunder Dojo can afford to build such special training rooms in each headquarter city. However, your contribution rank has to reach a certain level before you can access them, and you only receive a set amount of time to train in them every year.\"We'll do it like this\"Gao Feng took out a piece of paper, which had all of the materials the fire hammer squad hunted printed on it, \"This list contains what we earned this time. Each material has its own market price, so the price of all of these materials added together comes to around 2.2 billion\" Gao Feng toned his voice down a bit.It's a bit late now, so there aren't many people remaining in the bar. Well, it isn't a big deal even if someone else overhears.\"For this time's hunt, Luo Feng and I were the main force while Chen Gu, Wei Tie, and Wei Qing were support. So Chen Gu, Wei Tie, and Wei Qing each get 10%, which is 220 million each. Luo Feng and I each get 35%, which is 770 million each!\" Gao Feng looked at everyone, \"Nobody has any objections right\"The members of the fire hammer squad all laughed.Objections?They usually earn 100 million over the course of a year or two. How long has this been? Chen Gu and the others have already earned 220 million! Of course, that's connected to the fact that they used genetic medicine to increase their skill. If their skill didn't increase, then they wouldn't have been able to assist Luo Feng and Gao Feng at all in #003 city.\"Luo Feng, pick some materials that are worth around 770 million. You decide how you want to deal with them\" Gao Feng passed the paper over and immediately yelled towards the bar, \"Bring a pen over here\"Luo Feng looked at the paper in front of him and carefully inspected the list.After the pen came, Luo Feng swiftly checked the materials he wanted. Because fighters frequently communicate with each other over the internet and the purchasers of the materials are always competing with each other, the prices have long been clear. Usually, there isn't much of a difference.\"Luo Feng, you're selling the materials to the Dojo of Limits for contribution points to buy an instruction manual?\" asked Gao Feng.\"I'm preparing to purchase the first four stages of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd\" said Luo Feng helplessly, \"I just want to buy the fourth stage but, unfortunately, they don't sell them one by one!\". When you purchase an instruction manual, you have to buy it starting from the first level. Actually, Luo Feng wanted to purchase the fifth stage of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd too.However, you would need 2 billion, half price of 1 billion, to purchase the first five stages! And the half price requirement is a three star contribution rank, which is equivalent to a million contribution points! If you convert money into contribution points, then each contribution point is equivalent to 100,000 Chinese dollars. This means that you need 10 billion! Even if it's cheaper to sell materials to the Dojo of Limits in return for contribution points, Luo Feng doesn't have that much.So, for now, he can only purchase the first four stages.The first four stages of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd costs 500 million, half price 250 million. The half price requirement is a 'two star contribution rank', which is just 100,000 contribution points.\"Buying instruction scrolls are indeed a gigantic money sink\" Wei Qing couldn't help but to nod his head on the side, \"The HR alliance sells instruction manuals at a much cheaper price compared to the Dojo of Limits' full price. However, it's also much more expensive than the Dojo of Limits' half price\".\"I know, the full price of the first four stages of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffdat the Dojo of LImits is 500 million, half price 250 million. And at the HR alliance, even though there isn't any contribution rank requirement, it still costs 400 million!\" Luo Feng shook his head helplessly. The half price offered by the Dojo of Limits is clearly the most attractive option! Sadly, the requirement for that half price is also very high.\"I already calculated that selling the monster materials to the Dojo of Limits is more cost efficient\"\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe second day. The fire hammer squad directly went to Jiang-Nan headquarter city's HR alliance market. First, captain Gao Feng, Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and Chen Gu went to take out the materials stored in the large safes. After that, Luo Feng received the materials that he selected earlier.Layer after layer in the bag was opened. Only until it was stretched to a height of 1.2 meters was it able to fit all of the materials.Gao Feng, Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and Chen Gu sold all their materials to the HR alliance. After bargaining a bit, they earned a slight bit more than they thought they would have. Gao Feng earned 780 million while Wei Tie, Wei Qing, and Chen Gu earned a little bit more than 220 million.\"Go, head towards the Limit Hall\"The Limit Hall was the headquarters of the Dojo of Limits in Jiang-Nan headquarter city, but Luo Feng rarely visited this place.\"Gao Feng\"\"Big fire cannon\"\"Crazy\"After entering the first floor of the Limit Hall, quite a few fighters recognized Luo Feng's group and passionately gave their greetings. Luo Feng and the others also smiled as they chatted; most of them recognized each other while they were resting in the resupplying base. And, as of now, Luo Feng is quite famous.Under the lead of a woman wearing a blue suit, Luo Feng and the others got on an elevator and arrived at the 23rd floor.\"Ding!\" The doors of the elevator opened.\"Please follow me\" the woman wearing the blue suit smiled as she brought Luo Feng and the others into an office. There was a middle aged woman sitting in this office.\"The fire hammer squad, welcome, welcome\" the middle aged woman smiled as she said, \"My name is Luo Yun Qin\".\"I'm familiar with manager Luo\" smiled Luo Feng as he said, \"Manager Luo, we've brought you some materials this time, have a look\" after saying that, he placed his gigantic bag on the floor and released the ropes. Instantly, the huge amounts of materials poured into a metal machine on the side.Luo Yun Qin's eye's flashed and she immediately pulled out her safe. After opening it, she pulled out a tool.\"Beep beep beep beep~\"From the scanning of the machine, each material's quality, name, and price directly displayed onto the screen. Without the need to check anything by hand, the total price quickly showed itself on the screen.\"A total of 510 million and 255,000 contribution points\" said Luo Yun Qin as she smiled.Luo Feng slightly nodded.If you sold this batch of materials to the HR alliance, you would probably earn around 770 million. And at the Limit Hall, you only earn around 2/3 of the price: 510 million. Even though you lose 260 million, you earn 255,000 contribution points in its place. If you rely on pure donations to earn contribution points, you need 2.55 billion.In other words.....Every 10 million you lose by selling the materials to the Limit Hall earns you 10,000 contribution points.This is 10 times more efficient than donating! clearly, the Dojo of Limits hopes for everyone to earn contribution points by selling them their materials. There's a bit of punishment in donating, since you need 100,000 dollars just for 1 contribution point.\"Are you sure you want to sell them?\" Luo Yun Qin smiled as she looked at Luo Feng.\"I'm sure\" Luo Feng nodded.Unlike the HR alliance, there is no bargaining at the Limit Hall. But naturally, the Limit Hall's prices are usually very fair and transparent.\"Add the two low level commander monster materials into my battle record\" said Luo Feng.\"Alright. Going by your battle record, your fighter rank is now 'beginner level warlord'\" nodded Luo Yun Qin. A fighter's rank is determined by their battle record.For example, if you want to reach the 'beginner level warlord' rank, you have to have slain two low level commanders! .....However, battle records are usually not too reliable.Because nobody knows whether or not you actually killed the monster yourself. You can easily purchase the material and pretend it's your own.As a result, the so called 'fighter rank' isn't really that useful. In the circle of fighters, everyone knows who's strong and who's weak. For example, if some kid from a rich family purchases two horde leader corpses and says he killed them, his rank would become 'beginner level wargod'.And once he does this, he'll easily attract many fighters wanting a spar.If he has the strength, then nothing will happen.If he doesn't have the strength, then he'll be super embarrassed when he gets walked all over by a group of warlords. So most people aren't willing to try and advance their ranks until they have enough strength to back it up.\"When I killed around 10,000 soldier level monsters in two months, most of them being high level soldiers, most of the fighters were sure that I was a beginner level warlord! If so, then I might as well directly raise my fighter rank to 'beginner level warlord'.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdLate into the night of the same day. Luo Feng's audiovisual room.The display on the wall entered the 'Home of Limits' page. The clearest thing on this page was this list:Name: Luo FengSex: MaleAddress: Jiang-Nan city, ChinaFighter identification number: 426123205608010002Level: Warlord (beginner)Contribution: 255612 Points (two stars)Balance: 1189800000 Chinese dollars\"Internet market, instruction manual \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd\" Luo Feng swiftly tapped on the wireless keyboard and entered the page to purchase the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd instruction manual. After browsing for a bit, he saw the first line at the top '\ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd all nine stages \u04bb\u04bb 100 billion (full price) 50 billion (half price requirement: four star contribution rank). This is a gigantic amount! Even more expensive than the elixir of life*, and it needs a four star contribution rank.Luo Feng shook his head and lightly tapped the purchase button for the first four stages.\"Please confirm whether or not you want to purchase the first four stages of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd. You need to pay 250 million Chinese dollars\"\"Confirm!\" Luo Feng tapped.\"Please verify your fingerprint and confirm again\"Luo Feng placed his finger on the fingerprint scanner on the wireless keyboard and shook his head as he sighed..... too bad the first five stages of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd needs a three star contribution rank for half price. Having no choice, he could only purchase the first four stages. Usually, the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd gets harder and harder as you progress.Because of some special circumstances, he was luckily able to finish the first three stages. This fourth stage will probably take an extremely long time, unless something special happens again.\"Beep!\"\"Fingerprint confirmed\"\"Purchase successful! Deduction successful! The instruction manual for the first four stages of the \ufffd\ufffdNine Stage Thunder Blade\ufffd\ufffd will arrive at Mr. Luo Feng's home within 24 hours\" the screen continuously displayed the messages.Luo Feng let out a long sigh of relief: \"Now that I've purchased the instruction manual, I gotta figure out how I'm gonna safely sell the dragon egg, the battle uniform, and the blade!\"*TL note: For those who are curious and forgot, the current market price for an elixir of life is 30 billion (of course, there's only demand and no supply).Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"The HR alliance, the Dojo of Limits, and the Thunder Dojo. Even though my identity will be revealed when selling materials to them, I can still tell them to put the money into my nameless account. However, their higher ups could easily reveal the fact that I earned a ton of money\" frowned Luo Feng, \"Looks like I can only sell them through the black market!\"Where there's light, there's darkness!The competition over buying materials has always been quite fierce. The HR alliance is the alliance between many families and financial groups. Even though this alliance is, for the most part, stable, there's still quite a lot of competition going on inside. Some financial groups and families hold more positions in the HR alliance and therefore enjoy more benefits.Because of competition, all sorts of services exist.You're a fighter that wants to hide his identity and sell some materials? Alright! If other managers won't do it, I'll do it!You're a fighter that wants to store money in another country's nameless account? Alright, everything will be done for you!As long as you have valuables, tons of material purchasing managers will fight over them!\"Hmhm, so many messages\" Luo Feng entered the 'Warlord fighter discussion area' and just simply typed in the three words 'Selling monster materials'. Tons and tons of posts then appeared.Reading the huge amounts of replies also shows safety and credibility.\"I want to sell the dragon egg, battle uniform, and blade. Yea, I better not sell it in Jiang-Nan headquarter city. I better sell it somewhere else\" Luo Feng read the posts one by one, \"Hm, this one seems good! Quite a few famous warlord fighters are replying to this post. Huh, even a wargod has replied to this post!\"The Home of Limits discussion area is divided into three ranks: Warrior level, Warlord level, and Wargod level.Warrior level fighters can only view and post in the warrior discussion area. Warlord level fighters can view and post in both warrior and warlord discussion areas.Wargod level fighters can view and post in all three discussion areas. Everyone's account corresponds to their personal ID, so they can't fake it.\"Quite a few people sell their things to him, so his credibility is pretty good. From Kyoto headquarter city?\" Luo Feng slightly smiled as he nodded, \"Wang Hou? This name sounds pretty boss, yup, it'll be him\"\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdMorning of the second day, Luo Feng left home to walk around several places in Yang Zhou city and purchased a cell phone and sim card. Most cell phones need your real name, but some stores sell sim cards without the need to check your ID card. In this world, as long as you have money, people are willing to take risks.As he bought the cell phone and sim card, Luo Feng also bought glasses, a fake moustache, and some other simple accessories.\"Hello\" Luo Feng stood in his home's training room and dialed that Wang Hou's phone number using the new cell phone.\"Hello, how are you. I'm Wang Hou. How can I help you today?\" Wang Hou's voice was gentle. He left some special contact information in the Home of Limits' fighter discussion area just for these types of scenarios. Most of the people who call him are pretty powerful fighters, since normal fighters don't have any treasures to sell.Luo Feng smiled, \"I want to sell you some things that will blow you away\"\"Oh? What kind of treasure?\" Wang Hou's voice, carried from the phone, had a hint of surprise in it.\"Worth over 10 billion!\" said Luo Feng.On the other end of the phone.Wang Hou was originally happily chatting with a white skinned beauty with a great body, but when he heard this, he immediately stood up. Ignoring the beauty, he directly went to a corner near the window and said quietly, \"I can handle this. As long as you can bring it out, I can take it! I'm sure you have heard of my credibility. This credibility was built up from trade after trade, so you have no need to worry about the price\"Over 10 billion!This is definitely a huge trade. Usually, only wargods offer such a huge trade.\"Alright, when you pay, I hope you can send the money to Europe's Swiss international nameless bank, is that alright?\" Luo Feng continued to speak.\"Absolutely no problem. Many fighters who cooperate with me like to store their money there\" laughed Wang Hou.Swiss international banks have always been popular even before the Grand Nirvana period.Building up the name of a bank or a financial group is extremely difficult, but destroying it is simple. These Swiss international banks have been building up their name over such a long period of time, therefore bringing them lots of business.\"May I ask when you plan on coming?\" asked Wang Hou.\"I'll go to the main sector of Kyoto headquarter city these two days. I'll contact you at that time\" said Luo Feng.\"Alright, alright. I still don't know your name\"\"My last name is Wei\" answered Luo Feng.\"Oh, Mr. Wei, then I'll wait for your grand arrival\" Wang Hou's voice had a bit of passion in it.Luo Feng smiled as he hung up. He has never attempted these kinds of things before, but it seems like..... it's really easy. Just one phone call and everything's organized.\"First, I should open an account in a Swiss international bank\" Luo Feng used his new phone in his hand to swiftly enter the web page of a Swiss international bank and quickly applied for a 'nameless account'. The password was simple, yet safe with its triple part 12 character code comprised of Chinese characters, alphabetical letters, and numbers.\"Done, now I just have to wait to sell my stuff\"That night, under the light of the first floor's living room, Luo Feng sat around a table with his family and ate dinner.\"Dad, mom, I'm going out tomorrow to deal with some business\" laughed Luo Feng, \"I'll probably be able to return the day after tomorrow\"\"Oh, where're you going?\" Luo Hong Guo looked at his son with a look of astonishment.Luo Feng laughed: \"To meet a fighter friend\"\"Hong Guo, don't bother asking. Maybe Feng is going to meet his girl friend\" snickered mother Gong Xin Lan on the side. Luo Feng was dumbfounded because of this. Gong Xin Lan continued, \"However, son, truth be told, you're quite old now. After next year you'll be 20. You should start getting into a relationship. A relationship needs at least one or two years before marriage. By then, it won't be early\"Brother Luo Hua also laughed on his wheelchair: \"Yea, bro, even I'm faster than you. You better step up your game\"\"You little kid\" Luo Feng shook his head as he laughed, \"Oh yea, how're you doing with your girlfriend Nan?\"\"What else, of course the same as usual I guess\" Luo Hua was extremely happy.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe morning of the next day. After eating breakfast with his family. Luo Feng carried his gigantic backpack as he left his home. He didn't ride on the Dojo of Limits' private car, but took a cab to the train station.Beside the train station was a 'Kungfu' fast food restaurant.Fast food restaurants like Kungfu, KFC, McDonalds, etc. always have an astonishing amount of people entering and leaving them. Luo Feng entered this 'Kungfu' fast food restaurant, randomly ate some stuff, and then entered one of the rooms in the restroom. After locking the door, Luo Feng swiftly drew some basic makeup.He wore the glasses, pasted on the moustache, slightly darkened his skin color, wore a hat, and made his shoes taller.Suddenly, Luo Feng seemed like a completely different person.In this kind of fast food restaurant, hundreds of people are inside at any time. With people passing and going every single moment, who would notice Luo Feng? After Luo Feng finished his basic makeup, he left the fast food restaurant and rode the fastest train leaving Yang Zhou city.As of now, it's quite costly to protect the trains, so regular people rarely leave the headquarter city. Fighters don't have to pay anything..... as long as they show their fighter ID card, they don't even need to purchase a train ticket to board the train. They can also get off whenever they want.This is one of the privileges of a fighter.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe same day, around 6 PM.\"Dear guests, the train is about to enter the station. Guests who are getting off at Kyoto headquarter city, please get off the train from the front door with all your belongings\" with the broadcast inside the train, Luo Feng carried his bag as he got off the train.\"Kyoto headquarter city!\"Luo Feng looked around, \"The largest, most populous city in China that's also its political center?\"\"However, compared to Jiang-Nan headquarter city, it's not much bigger. It's just that the humidity here is way lower, so it's a bit colder\" Luo Feng smiled as he left the train station and called a cab. He headed straight towards an entertainment area, 'Will Palace', that's quite famous in Kyoto city. It's also considerably high class.In front of the main gate to the area stood uncountable beauties wearing all sorts of clothes, which made it seem like one was entering the country of women.\"Mister.....\" a man wearing a suit slightly smiled.\"Give me a personal, quiet room. I don't want anyone to bother me\" Luo Feng flashed his fighter ID, which made the receiving manager much more polite: \"Understood, please follow me\"Will Palace, room G #3.\"Mister, all the wine is inside here\" said the manager respectfully, \"May I ask if you need anything else?\"\"No need, and without my permission, I don't want anyone to come in here\" ordered Luo Feng.\"Understood, there's a service list and phone over there. If you have any sort of request, feel free to order us\" said the manager as he smiled and left. Luo Feng easily locked the door and, at the same time, scanned the entire room with his spiritual force. There was no sort of recording device in the room. The room also had a beautiful design with an extremely delicate flooring made out of monster fur on the ground.Luo Feng looked at the screen on the wall, which displayed a list of services.\"Damn, they sure can enjoy themselves\" Luo Feng shook his head as he laughed and dialed that Wang Hou's number.\"Hello, Mr. Wei\" Wang Hou passionately yelled.\"Wang Hou, I'm in Will Palace's 'Chinese Lobby' G #3 room in the main sector of Kyoto headquarter city\" responded Luo Feng.\"Alright, understood, I'll be there within an hour\" a hint of excitement could be heard in Wang Hou's voice.After Luo Feng hung up, he laid on the sofa and made himself some tea with a tea bag taken from the cabinet.\"Hm?\" Luo Feng felt his phone in his pocket vibrating.\"Who's calling me?\" the phone in his pocket is Luo Feng's old phone, and not his new one.Luo Feng picked up his phone and looked: a call from home.\"Hello\" Luo Feng picked up his phone.\"Feng, your brother, your brother had an accident\" mother Gong Xin Lan was sobbing as her voice carried over.Luo Feng was startled as he ferociously stood up.Smash! The dropped tea cup shattered as the tea inside spilled out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Luo, don't, don't panic\" mother Gong Xin Lan sobbed as she spoke, \"Your brother almost drowned, but he's been saved and is fine now\"\"Drowned? Mom, what's going on?\" Luo Feng just couldn't understand: how could something happen to his brother in the headquarter city? Isn't the nanny always with him?\"Feng, this is what happened: This afternoon, the nanny brought your brother Hua to the nearby park to play. You know that your brother frequently goes to the park..... this time, he met his girlfriend's parents in the park. That Nan's parents invited your brother for a chat on the side\"Luo Feng frowned. They never told his girlfriend's parents about Luo Hua and his girlfriend's situation.And this time, his girlfriend's parents are clearly talking to his brother Luo Hua for a reason.\"At that time, your brother asked the nanny to bring him there and talked to Nan's parents for a whole hour. After that, Nan's parents left\"Luo Feng's mom's voice was a bit hoarse in the phone, probably due to crying too much, \"Afterwards, your brother said he wanted to stroll around the park alone and told the nanny to wait for him at the gate to the park\"\"The nanny believed that there wasn't any danger in the park, since it was all scenery, and didn't think any further. She then proceeded to wait for your brother at the gate to the park\"\"However, who would've thought that your brother would actually push his wheelchair into the beautiful lake, which froze a long time ago. There was only one hole, which was created by some playing children. And your brother went right into the lake through that hole\"Luo Feng's face turned pale as he listened. Even though he knew that his brother was eventually saved, but falling into a frozen lake as a handicapped person showed that he didn't want anything more to do with this world.Virtually suicide.\"Thankfully, one of the fighters in our sector, a young man named 'Qiu Yi', directly jumped into the lake, broke through the ice, and swam below to search for your brother. He finally found your brother and saved him! At that time, your brother wasn't breathing anymore, but thankfully, Qiu Yi knew some CPR and saved him. Afterwards, the doctors in our sector said that if they were just a little bit late, he would've passed away for sure\"\"I wonder what kind of cruel words Nan's parents said that pushed my son to the brink of death. Don't they have a child too?\" His mother couldn't hold it in at all and started sobbing again.Luo Feng just clenched his fists.Ever since his brother became handicapped, he was usually alone at home. He attended classes through the internet at home too! Being alone for long periods of time caused him to be quite introverted. The only people he opened his mind to were his family.Mentally, his brother was extremely weak.\"That Nan's parents probably only cared about their daughter and said all sorts of harsh words to make my brother leave their daughter. Of course they wouldn't care how my brother would feel\"People are all the same.In Luo Feng's heart, his parents and brother are the most importantAnd in Nan's parents' hearts, their daughter is, of course, the most important!\"Mom, how's he now?\" Luo Feng continued to ask.\"The doctor in the sector said that there isn't any problem now. However, your brother is emotionally unstable, so your dad and I are taking turns to take care of him, in case he does something foolish again\" mother Gong Xin Lan shook her head as she said, \"Feng, you should come back earlier. Hua opens more of himself to you and isn't willing to tell us many things\"Luo Feng and Luo Hua are close in age, so Luo Hua was naturally willing to open up more to Luo Feng.\"Okay, I'll be able to return home tomorrow morning\" nodded Luo Feng.After he sells the dragon egg, battle uniform, and blade, he'll ride the train through the night and rush back.After hanging up, Luo Feng sat on the couch; he was quite depressed. His brother actually had a decent life all these years. After moving into Ming-Yue sector and becoming familiar with that Nan, his brother became even happier.But who would've known...... that this first love made his brother extremely happy, and also drove him to death.\"This experience, compared to a regular person, has an even larger impact on my brother\"\"That Nan's parents are probably against their relationship just because my brother is handicapped\"Luo Feng took in a deep breath, \"Soon. If I'm lucky this time, I might be able to earn that 30 billion needed for that 'Elixir of Life'!\" 30 billion! Of course, that dragon egg isn't worth that much. The main things are still the battle uniform and the blade.\"I hope they're SS grade. If they are, then I'll be rich\"Luo Feng himself didn't have a way to grade them, for he would need some professional detectors to do so. Sadly, Luo Feng didn't have these detectors, and he didn't want the HR alliance or the people from the Dojo of Limits to examine these things.Time passed slowly.Bang! Bang! Bang! The sounds of the door knocks carried over. Luo Feng walked over and opened the door.\"I'm here\" smiled Wang Hou.\"Please enter\"Luo Feng let him in and then directly closed the door.The two of them sat on the couch.\"I heard that Mr. Wei has some valuable things?\" Wang Hou's smile was bright, and his eyes looked like they just found some prey.Luo Feng slightly smiled as he directly opened the huge backpack he brought with him. The green dragon egg took up the most space in the bag, and Luo Feng carried it over and put it on the couch as he smiled towards Wang Hou: \"Wang Hou, this is a dragon egg. I'm sure you can guess what kind of dragon egg it is\"\"Dragon egg? A dragon egg worth over 10 billion? Could it be the East China Sea's green dragon's dragon egg?\" Wang Hou was flabbergasted.Luo Feng froze.The East China Sea's green dragon? That's an emperor level monster, way stronger than a horde leader.After all these years, only one green dragon's egg showed itself on this world. According to the Home of Limits, it sold for an astronomical price.\"What's with this guy's guess? After doing business for so long, I thought he would be able to recognize it straight away\"Luo Feng shook his head and said nothing.What Luo Feng didn't know was that dragon eggs are extremely rare. Wang Hou himself has only personally seen two of them. Of course he wouldn't know what kind of dragon egg this was.\"No, the green dragon's egg is larger than this\" said Wang Hou.\"I never said it was the green dragon's egg, hurry and examine it\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to say.He said that his things were worth over 10 billion, not just one dragon egg.\"This is the first dragon egg I have received, hehe\" Wang Hou's eyes flashed.\"A dragon egg\" Wang Hou swiftly opened his bag, which contained three locked safes. He took out one, and took out a pair of detectors from it afterwards. As if they were spiders, one of the detector's antenna touched against the surface of the dragon egg. Suddenly, the display of the detector swiftly showed a large amount of numbers.Wang Hou smiled as he looked at the numbers, \"Mr. Wei, you sure are powerful. You even got a dragon egg! In today's world, none of the monsters worthy of the title of 'Dragon' are easy to deal with\"\"The test is complete?\" Luo Feng looked towards the display.\"Almost\" Wang Hou smiled and was totally relaxed.\"Oh\" Wang Hou's eyes flashed and then looked at the screen. He then smiled towards Luo Feng, \"According to the database, this is a steel armored dragon's egg! A steel armored dragon is above average out of all the monsters with the title of 'Dragon'. I'll be straightforward and go by the market price for this dragon egg: 5 billion Chinese dollars!\"Of course, before coming, Luo Feng already got all the prices straight. 5 billion is indeed quite a generous price: even if you go to the HR alliance, you probably won't be able to get such a price.\"Alright, straightforward enough\" Luo Feng smiled, \"This price is fine\"\"There are tons of people willing to speak up for how I do things\" Wang Hou smiled, \"Business always pays attention to the details. If I scam you, you'll probably trash talk me on the discussion boards..... if my credibility lowers, then I won't be able to do any business. So\u04bb\u04bb once anyone does business with me, they'll know that Wang Hou is fair\"Luo Feng slightly smiled in reply.\"Mr. Wei\" Wang Hou couldn't help but to say, \"You probably still have more things?\"\"I do\" Luo Feng nodded as he took out a blade still in its sheath from his bag.\"Oh?\" Wang Hou's eyes flashed as he looked at the blade and looked at Luo Feng with a face of astonishment, \"This is a really nice blade. Even this sheath is extremely expensive. May I have a look?\"\"Please do\" Luo Feng started to get a bit expectant: I wonder what grade this blade is, at least S grade for sure.\"CHI\"After unsheathing the blade, Wang Hou examined it carefully and couldn't help but to nod, \"Great blade, great blade, this is a really great blade. I'm 100% sure that a wargod used this blade. If I'm seeing this correctly, this should be a SS grade blade. This blade is indeed worth quite a lot\"Luo Feng was extremely happy inside: this blade was actually SS grade!\"We'll need to see how damaged this blade is before we determine on the price\" smiled Wang Hou, \"Of course, a blade starts off with no damage, but slowly gets damaged as it battles against monsters. The blade itself suffers damages unseen to the eye and, as time goes on, the damages pile up. It'll continue like this until one day, the blade itself breaks\"Luo Feng nodded...... the description for an A rank weapon is that it can virtually fight against all A rank monsters without suffering any damage.Knowing this, weapons can still break.\"The less damaged it is, the more it's worth. Naturally, the more damaged it is, the less it's worth\"\"Let me check\" Wang Hou immediately opened another safe and took out another pair of detectors to examine the blade. A dreamy light shot out from the detector and enveloped this blade.The detector's display immediately showed large amounts of information in the form of numbers. Soon enough, the detector calculated the results.\"0% damaged\" Wang Hou was extremely surprised.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Feng couldn't help but to let out a smile. The fact that the blade is 0% damaged means that it'll definitely sell for a good price.\"This weapon was probably used to battle against a monster lower than the SS grade\" smiled Wang Hou as he said.If an SS grade weapon is used to battle against an SS grade emperor level monster, miniscule damages will start to pile up on the blade. As long as the damages continue to pile up over time, it might break.However, if an SS grade blade is used to battle against horde leader and commander level monsters, then it'll take absolutely no damage at all.\"Wang Hou, what price can you offer for this blade?\" continued Luo Feng.\"If you try to purchase a blade like this, it'll cost 30 billion, half price 15 billion. If you purchase it in the Palace of Wargods, the lowest price will be 10 billion\" smiled Wang Hou, \"I'm sure that you know all of this already\"Luo Feng said nothing.Know this?He didn't know much about the legendary 'Palace of Wargods'. He didn't think that the best deal for a weapon in the palace of wargods would be even cheaper than the Dojo of Limits' half price.\"'100 billion' is the cheapest price possible in the Palace of Wargods, and the cost to create this blade is around 9 billion. If I purchase this blade, then I'll have to pay tons of fees before I can sell it again! So the highest price I can give you is 8 billion: any higher, and I won't gain any profit at all\" explained Wang Hou.Luo Feng understood that if you ask for 9 billion when the cost to make it is 9 billion, you might as well ask the market to make one again. Why would they bother buying your used good? Even though this blade is 0% damaged, there's no guarantee. After all, the weapons sold by the HR alliance, the Dojo of Limits, etc. all have their word to back up the quality!\"Alright, 8 billion then\" smiled Luo Feng as he nodded.\"Straightforward\" Wang Hou also smiled, \"Mr. Wei, how about we have a friendly chat for a bit later? I'll pay! This Will Palace is one of the nine greatest palaces, so if you want to find some girls, feel free to mention your requests. Age, height, three sizes, education, looks, virgin or not, etc.\"Wang Hou explained skillfully. This is a huge trade! The best service in this Will Palace is probably a couple million per night.However, with this trade, a couple million isn't even worth mentioning.\"Wang Hou, don't rush, I still have more things\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to say.\"More?\" Wang Hou froze.He thought that they were done with the dragon egg and blade, since the price has indeed exceeded 10 billion. Who would've thought that there were even more treasures to be revealed? And clearly, this Mr. Wei in front of his eyes brings out his things from worst to best! If the dragon egg was 5 billion and the SS grade blade was 8 billion, then what about the final treasure?\"Hurry, hurry and show me\" Wang Hou was getting a bit excited.Luo Feng slightly smiled and brought out the final treasure from his bag\u04bb\u04bb\u04bb an entire battle uniform set! Including the boots, arm guards, vest, etc.\"Man, what a person\" Wang Hou couldn't help but to take in a deep breath, \"Could this battle uniform set also be SS grade?\". Depending on what kind of equipment it is, even if they're both SS grade, the difference could be enormous. For example, when comparing a throwing knife, which doesn't need that many materials to make, and a blade, the price difference is huge.And the harder it is to make, the more expensive it is: an extremely flexible battle uniform is way more expensive than blades and swords.\"Take a look\" Luo Feng placed the battle uniform set on the table.\"Okay\" Wang Hou immediately used the detectors that previously examined the blade. The dreamy light once again enveloped the battle uniform and examined every part. The detector's display also swiftly showed a huge amount of numbers. Wang Hou looked at the display and smiled at Luo Feng: \"Mr. Wei, I can tell that this battle uniform is at least S grade. Whether or not it's SS grade, we'll have to see\"Luo Feng smiled and said nothing.\"Hm?\" Wang Hou's expression suddenly focused as he stared at the display; his smile was completely gone.\"What happened?\" Luo Feng frowned.\"Look at this\" Wang Hou turned the display towards Luo Feng, and Luo Feng took a close look.....Two items have already been evaluated\u04bb\u04bbS grade battle boots, S grade combat trousers, the rest were still being evaluated.Luo Feng's face slightly changed.S grade?This uniform set was S grade! Even though SS grade and S grade are only apart by one grade, the price difference between the two is like the difference between the sky and the earth.\"How could this be?\" Luo Feng didn't think that Wang Hou would deceive him, since Luo Feng has seen these delicate detectors before when selling his materials to the HR alliance and the Dojo of Limits..... and according to what he knows, these detectors always compare their data to the main database before making their conclusion.In other words, the results are always recorded by the main database, so no one would dare to falsify the results.\"Hu!\" Wang Hou took in a breath, \"Alright, it's all done. Mr. Wei, I'll give you some bad news first. Your uniform set isn't a SS grade set. At the same time, I'll tell you some good news. Your battle uniform set isn't a S grade uniform set either\"\"Because, it's a uniform set made out of both S grade and SS grade components!\" smiled Wang Hou, \"The vest of this uniform set is SS grade\"Luo Feng secretly let out a breath.The results were clear on the display: all the components of the uniform were S grade except for the vest, which was SS grade. And the most important part of the uniform set was the vest, since it's the main part of the whole uniform.\"The powerful fighter that used this uniform set probably didn't have enough money, so he only bought an SS grade vest!\" smiled Wang Hou, \"This is a very common course of action in the palace of wargods\". Luo Feng could figure out that the other parts of the uniform set were still S grade.\"What price will you offer?\" inquired Luo Feng.\"A complete SS grade uniform set is worth 120 billion in the Dojo of Limits, half price 60 billion. In the palace of wargods, the lowest price is 40 billion! This SS grade vest is the core of the entire uniform set, so the price of it is half of the price of the entire uniform set! 0% damaged; if you purchase this in the palace of wargods, the lowest price is 20 billion\"\"However, the material of this vest is clearly not worth 20 billion, so my offer will be lower. The highest price I can give you is 15 billion for this SS grade vest\" smiled Wang Hou, \"Of course, with my authority, I'm unable to move such a large amount of money so quickly. If you're willing to sell it to me, you'll probably have to wait 15 minutes for me to get the money together\"Luo Feng's heart pounded.Dragon egg for 5 billion, SS grade blade for 8 billion, and this SS grade vest for 15 billion. Totaled up: 28 billion! Extremely close to 30 billion.\"What price can you offer for the other components of the vest?\" asked Luo Feng.Keep in mind that everyone's body size is different so, naturally, the battle uniforms come in different sizes too. Luo Feng has tried on this uniform set before, and it was clearly too large for him. This was why he didn't plan on keeping it.\"This.....\" Wang Hou slightly frowned, and then said, \"Mr. Wei, I'll be honest with you. First, all the other parts of the uniform set are damaged. Because of this, we can't directly sell them. Next, the market for battle vests is extremely good, but for battle boots and combat trousers..... \u04bb \u04bb\u04bb \u04bb \u04bb we'll do this!!\"\"In the Dojo of Limits, a complete S grade battle uniform set is 12 billion, half price 6 billion. The lowest price for it in the palace of wargods is 4 billion. And your S grade uniform set is missing the core component: the 'combat vest'. In the first place, the price wouldn't exceed 1.5 billion, and your parts aren't 0% damaged, so I can only give you the price of 800 million!\" Wang Hou shook his head as he laughed, \"And this is because of the previous trades we just did. I dare say that no one else would be willing to buy these parts for 800 million\"It was because of Wang Hou's credibility that Luo Feng went all the way to Kyoto headquarter city.Wang Hou's price offers are fair, so there's no need to bargain any further.\"800 million\" Luo Feng hesitated, and then nodded, \"Alright, 800 million!\". These parts were useless to him anyway.\"Mr. Wei, do you have anything else?\" asked Wang Hou.\"Nope\" Luo Feng couldn't help but to laugh, \"Calculate the total and then transfer the money to this account\" as he said that, Luo Feng took out a paper which had the nameless account he applied for at the 'Swiss international bank' and the corresponding identification password.Wang Hou smiled as he nodded: \"Dragon egg for 5 billion, SS grade blade for 8 billion, SS grade battle vest for 15 billion, damaged parts of an S grade battle uniform set for 800 million. In total: 28.8 billion!\"\"Mr. Wei, please wait a moment. I'll prepare the data of the uniform set and send it over to get permission to transfer the money\" Wang Hou swiftly typed some numbers on the detector's keyboard as he said that. The dreamy light from the detector enveloped the battle vest and sent the specific data values to his headquarters.Around 10 minutes later.\"Beep beep\" Wang Hou took out his cell phone and let out a smile.\"Mr. Wei, the money should be in the account now\" said Wang Hou as he looked at Luo Feng, \"We contacted headquarters to make an internal transfer at the Swiss international bank, which was why we were able to instantly transfer so much money\"Luo Feng's cell phone also rang.After taking out his cell phone to take a look, a message was displayed\u04bb\u04bb\"Valuable diamond level guest, your account ending in 189891, as of 23:36 on the 8th, has received a transfer of 28800000000 Chinese dollars. Remaining Chinese dollars in account: 28800000000 dollars. (Swiss International Bank)\"\"Glad to do business with you\" Luo Feng smiled as he extended his hand.\"A big customer like Mr. Wei needs to help me more in the future\" Wang Hou passionately shook hands with Luo Feng, \"Is Mr. Wei planning to......\" Wang Hou gave a look.\"Sorry, I have things to do\" Luo Feng carried his backpack, \"Then I'll be going first\"\"Oh, go ahead. I still need to organize these things anyway\" Wang Hou smiled. Luo Feng got on the train and left Kyoto headquarter city. Only until the morning of the second day at around 7 AM did he arrive at Jiang-Nan city's Yang-Zhou train station. Luo Feng went inside the bathroom at the Kungfu fast food restaurant next to the train station and took his accessories off. After washing his face, he returned to his original appearance.\"Time to go back home\"Luo Feng got on the cab and arrived at Ming-Yue sector's gate. Ming-Yue sector was a fighter sector, which was very strict on who could enter. Naturally, the cab had to stop in front of the gate.\"I'm back\" Luo Feng let out a sigh. That dragon egg, blade, and uniform set were like a hot potato. 28.8 billion! That, added with the money he already has, nears the total to 30 billion. Furthermore, he'll have more opportunities to make money in the future.\"Luo Feng\" the bald, old guardsman of Ming-Yue sector yelled.Luo Feng turned his head.The bald, old man laughed: \"There's a young lady named Zhen Nan. Last night, she came to the gate of the sector and called over and over again, hoping to meet your brother, without success. Later on in the night, she came to the sector again and asked for my help to transfer a letter to his family member. She hopes you can hand the letter to your brother Luo Hua\"\"Oh?\" Luo Feng's heart skipped a beat as he accepted the letter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swallowed StarCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter stepping into Ming-Yue sector, Luo Feng directly opened the letter.Even though his brother's girlfriend, Zhen Nan, wrote it for his brother, Luo Feng was worried about its content...... his brother just tried to kill himself yesterday and is extremely emotionally unstable. If there are some stimulating things in the letter, it could make his brother go out of control. Luo Feng wasn't willing to risk it! \"I want to see as to what exactly is written in here\" Luo Feng's face was filled with anger but, as he read the letter, his expression started to loosen up.\"Sigh\" Luo Feng shook his head, \"At least my brother has an eye for people\". Luo Feng realized from this letter that.....Nan's parents talked with Luo Hua behind her back! Nan didn't even know that her parents knew that she was dating Luo Hua; she only realized when she heard that Luo Hua tried to kill himself in the pond.After hearing this, Nan almost fainted.Her parents wouldn't allow Nan to meet Luo Hua no matter how much she cried and argued. After that, she begged with everything she had and convinced her parents by telling them that this is the last time she'll meet Luo Hua.However, no matter how many times she called Luo Hua at the gate of Ming-Yue sector, she never received any reply. Since she couldn't even meet Luo Hua, she had no choice but to write a letter and ask his family to hand it over to him.\"Secretly continue their relationship? Hide it from their parents? Marry after they graduate?\" Luo Feng read the letter and sighed. Looks like that Nan girl is quite stubborn about this, as she's clearly not convinced by her parents.Ming-Yue sector villa #199, which is Luo Feng's home. The atmosphere was clearly quite heavy: father Luo Hong Guo sat on the couch in the living room and he seems to have aged a lot just over one night.\"Dad\" a voice carried from outside.\"Feng\" Luo Hong Guo stood up. At this time, Luo Feng already entered the house and Luo Hong Guo said to him quietly: \"Your mom is currently in the room with your brother. Your brother's emotional state has stabilized a bit, but, no matter what we say to him, he won't reply at all\"\"I understand\" Luo Feng took in a deep breath and headed towards his brother's room.Squeak! After opening the door, mother Gong Xin Lan, who was sitting beside the bed, saw Luo Feng and stood up: \"Feng\".\"Mom, you can go outside and get some rest first\" said Luo Feng.Gong Xin Lan glanced at her little son, Luo Hua, who was sitting on his wheelchair on the balcony without making a sound, and then shook her head before leaving the room.\"This time, my brother is quite.....\" Luo Feng found that his brother's face was much paler than before. He made no sound as he just blankly stared out the window; who knows what was going on in his head at that moment.\"Luo Hua\" yelled Luo Feng.Brother Luo Hua sat on the wheelchair without making the slightest movement, as if he didn't hear his brother Luo Feng's voice.\"Luo Hua, I promise you that you can marry Nan\" Luo Feng followed up with a second phrase.Luo Hua's body slightly moved on the wheelchair and then finally turned towards Luo Feng, let out a bitter smile, and then shook his head as he whispered: \"Brother, there's no point in you saying anything now. Nan and I have no future..... and I have completely given up. I'll never marry a girl in my life! Never! I'm not worthy\"\"What kind of dumb words are you spouting?\" Luo Feng slightly frowned as he scolded.\"Dumb words?\" Luo Hua immediately became agitated, \"Am I wrong? Can a handicap like me with useless legs marry Nan? Yea, Nan is willing to be my wife, but what about after that? In the future, everyone will point their fingers at Nan and say her husband's handicapped. How will Nan's family and friends look at her?\"\"I'm a handicapped person! Just a handicap!\"\"Nan and her parents won't have any face to meet their relatives and friends after she marries me, and people will always talk behind their back. Even if I make become successful, people will only think that Nan is with a handicap because of what I have and not who I am!\" Luo Hua shook his head, \"I don't want such a good girl like Nan to fall to the point where people will always point fingers at her and look down on her\"\"I don't want to drag her down!\"\"I will ruin the life of whoever marries me, so I might as well not marry anyone. There's no point in a handicap like me thinking about girlfriends and weddings\" Luo Hua let out a smile, which carried a bit of insanity in it.\"PA-!\"A loud slap landed on Luo Hua's face, which almost made Luo Hua fall out of his wheelchair. Blood flowed out of the side of Luo Hua's mouth.\"Bro\" Luo Hua froze.All these years.Until now, Luo Feng has never hit him before.\"COWARD!!!\" Luo Feng's expression was horrible.\"There are plenty of handicapped people that can shake the world! There's even one right in our Jiang-Nan city: the wargod 'Yu Yang' whose arms have been useless from birth. But with just his two legs, he earned the nickname 'Gigantic Axe' for himself, for his legs were comparable to gigantic axes! There are tons of similar cases in the circle of fighters, so don't even mention regular people\" after Luo Feng said that, his brother's face changed again.Of course Luo Hua knew about these cases.Ever since he was little, he has been reading way too many cases like this. He can probably spit out over 100 of them in one breath. \"Your girlfriend wrote this letter for you, take a look\" Luo Feng handed the letter over.Luo Hua accepted it with suspicion and, as he read it, the expression on his face started to change yet again.\"Marry?\"\"Nan is a good girl, a very good one, and when I'm with her, I feel like I'm in a dream. However, I don't want people to point fingers at her in the future. I really, really don't want that to happen\" after saying that, Luo Hua couldn't hold back his tears anymore as they dripped onto the letter. Luo Hua raised his head and looked towards Luo Feng, \"Bro, as long as I can secretly watch Nan enjoy her life, that'll be enough, more than enough\"\"If you truly care about her, then you'll stay with her\" scolded Luo Feng.\"But I just\u04bb\u04bb\"\" Luo Hua couldn't help but to reach towards his legs, but the location where his thighs should be have long been... \"Come with me\" Luo Feng pushed the wheelchair and directly went out the room.\"Feng\" father Luo Hong Guo and mother Gong Xin Lan, who were outside the house, were shocked.\"I'm going to talk to Luo Hua for a bit\" with just a slight push from Luo Feng's hands, his brother's wheelchair was horizontally aligned as it rushed towards the second floor's audiovisual room.Inside the audiovisual room.\"Bro\" Luo Hua looked at Luo Feng.\"Look at the display\" at the same time, Luo Feng gave his command, \"Turn on!\". Beep\u04bb\u04bbBeep the projector swiftly projected some light onto the wall. Luo Feng sat on the couch as he tapped on the wireless keyboard, entered the 'Home of Limits, warlord discussion board', and searched the board for the three words 'Elixir of Life'.Very few people actually talk about the elixir of life.This item is just way too rare, so most warlord fighters can never find any. Naturally, there'll be very little news on it. However, there were still a few dozen related posts.Luo Feng directly opened one of the posts. Of course, Luo Feng has already read all of these since he has been searching all over for information about the elixir of life.\"This is.....\" Luo Hua froze.\"Look at this post and finish reading it\" said Luo Feng coldly.Luo Hua turned his head and started reading the short post that was described the 'Elixir of Life'. Even though it was short, it still explained about the most important ingredients along with the elixir's effect. Naturally, it also mentioned the price that it sold for a while ago. This elixir of life is extremely rare; there's no supply, only demand. Every time it appears, it appears in an auction.\"The main ingredient is the essence of the horde leader-surpassing, SS rank Emperor level monster, 'Earth Dragon's soul. The elixir can let you grow out new arms and legs? As long as you're still alive, you can grow them out no matter how bad of a condition you're in?\" Luo Hua was completely stunned by what this post was describing and, at the same time, his eyes were shining.Whether at the ingredients or the effect.\"No supply and only demand? The most recent elixir of life sold for an astronomical price of 30 billion Chinese dollars?\" Luo Hua, who was extremely excited, felt like a huge bucket of cold water poured onto him.\"30 billion?\" Luo Hua was familiar with investment and stocks.Since he's familiar with this field, he clearly understands what a gigantic sum 30 billion Chinese dollars is!\"See that? You can just grow out your legs again with an 'elixir of life'! At that time, you can stand up and confidently stand in front of Nan and her parents!\" as Luo Feng said that, Luo Hua shook his head.\"Bro, 30 billion man\"\"Yea, the assets of the extremely rich men of China near 100 billion. However, that's just the price of their stocks. First, their stocks are restricted so they don't have the authority to sell off all of it. Next, even if they could, the enormous amount would smash the market, since the value of them nears 100 billion. They'll be lucky to sell it off for 40 to 50 billion\" Luo Hua shook his head, \"30 billion in cash. Very, very few people in all of China can pull that out\"Luo Feng took out his cellphone from his pocket and started to log into the Swiss international bank's nameless account.In just a mere moment, he entered the account.\"Bro, what're you doing?\" Luo Hua looked at Luo Feng with confusion on his face.\"Look at this\" Luo Feng passed the phone over.Luo Hua was full of confusion; why is his brother passing his phone over at a time like this? He lowered his head and looked at the phone's display, which was clearly showing the amount of money stored.\"One zero, two zeroes, three zeroes.....\" Luo Hua blankly stared at the number '28800000000'.\"28.8 billion!\"Luo Hua raised his head towards Luo Feng; his face full of shock. His brother just became a fighter recently, so how did he make this gigantic sum of money! This amount of money is frightening. What he didn't know was that Luo Feng took so many risks that he almost lost his life, and that's with his special spirit reader powers too.\"Luo Hua\" said Luo Feng.Luo Hua blankly stared at his brother, not knowing what to say.\"All I want to say to you is: your brother definitely has the ability to purchase an 'elixir of life'\"Luo Feng looked seriously at his brother, \"And you, will definitely stand up again!\"Luo Hua's entire body was shaking.He wasn't dumb; obviously, his brother took a gigantic risk to earn that 28.8 billion, since nothing is free on this world. The larger the risk, the larger the reward. And all of this..... was for him.\"Bro!\" Luo Hua hugged Luo Feng and couldn't hold back his tears any longer.Luo Feng lightly patted his brother's back.A long moment later\u04bb\u04bb\"Luo Hua, you're smart, even smarter than me\" Luo Feng said seriously, \"You probably know that such a gigantic amount of money can bring about many troubles. So, you definitely can't utter even a single word about this to someone else, including mom, dad, and your girlfriend. Once you say something..... your brother could lose his life!\"Luo Hua was shocked: \"Bro, I won't say it even if it means death, I won't let you.....\"\"No worries\" smiled Luo Feng.Luo Feng only said that to make his brother understand the importance of this matter. Actually, even if the two wargods 'Vulture' and 'Scorpion' find out, they won't be able to trace it back to him. Even if his brother foolishly lets the cat out of the bag, how many people would actually believe him?\"Luo Hua, I told you that you'll confidently stand in front of lady Nan and her parents. And I always back up my words\" Luo Feng said softly.\"Okay\" Luo Hua heavily nodded.He knew that he'll probably never be able to forget the astronomical number that was showed to him on his brother's phone in the audiovisual room.And he'll never forget..... the promise his brother gave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
