    "Chapter 1": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 1Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cListen, sinner, Yudrain Aile.\u201dAn abstract voice came from above his head.\u201cYou are a sinner who forgot your duty and responsibility as the commander of the Cavalry, and attempted to conspire against the world with your unassailable claims. You dared to deceive the world and also tried to steal the World Sphere by invading the prohibited sanctuary. Do you admit that you tried to run away to another country when the truth came to light, the truth in which it was revealed and connected with the murder of the Duke of Peletta nine years ago, the destruction of the Pearl Tower seven years ago, and the riots and the red field five years ago?\u201dYuder laughed inwardly. He was a great sinner who would go down in history for a very long time.Was there anyone here who wanted to know the truth when they were only reciting the answers they already decided were the truth?Anyway, what they wanted to believe was not the gruesome reality that the world might soon fall into a crisis of existence, but the belief that the half-hearted Omega that was originally a lowly commoner dared to plot against them, so killing him would solve everything.Meanwhile, Yuder had been wandering around the world for years, trying to find someone who would listen to him and believe him. So many signs were saying that something bad was about to happen to the world. Yuder could feel something so huge that even he couldn\u2019t tell what was slowly approaching, but no one listened to him.With his cranky and sharp personality, Yuder, who repeatedly wandered outside without any family nor connections, was thoroughly isolated, and receiving criticism for being crazy.Even at this moment, he was all alone.If he had really left when he was asked to transfer to the next empire, would he have experienced this? Yuder moved one of his remaining eyes to look at the jade on the far-off platform.The emperor\u2019s place in the dim view was empty. At one time, he only relied on him instead. The emperor who whispered and ordered him to do many things that couldn\u2019t be handled publicly turned away when Yuder was caught.Instead, a man stood beside the throne with a black thorny tree cane. Embedded in that is a red stone.Not long ago, the cane belonged to Yuder. The uniform he wore as the commander of the Cavalry and the authority to stand right next to the throne once belonged to him.The man standing in his place\u00a0was once Yuder\u2019s subordinate. A man who had never dared to make eye contact with Yuder before had now taken his place. His attitude with the cane was remarkable.Who would blame him, now?In retrospect, so many things had been lost in the name of a great cause. He thought there would be no regrets no matter when he died, but it was not so when he stood before death. Many things were mixed up and swirled in his head.The stubbornness and pride that had sustained him.A great deal of work that still needed to be done.An unanswered question.The first one to leave.The future after he disappeared.And\u2026 the face of someone he had been forced to repress.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIn history, there has never been a criminal like this. The sinner does not reflect on his actions at all, even though he has committed a felony in which he tried to take advantage of the Emperor\u2019s trust and ruin the entire nation. His Majesty is sickened by the shock of putting such a man who does not know his honor and responsibility in an unbecoming position. So the punishment of the sin is death penalty, he is to be beheaded here today. Bless the generous Emperor forever!\u201dWAAAAAAThe petals fluttered and cheers rang out. Yuder was dragged onto the high altar by the arms of the soldiers.On the altar especially built to punish the high-handed criminal, a giant guillotine which made everyone see the decapitating scene, was shining a navy blue blade.A long torture threw his crushed body like a minced meat under the blade. Until his mana hole was destroyed, the strange pain, which had little to feel surrounded by a low and gentle energy, had been overwhelmed breathlessly. Yuder gasped as he felt his eyes whitened.Usually, criminals sentenced to death had a chance to leave a will, but Yuder was not given such an opportunity. Yuder finally looked up at the blue sky, enough to make his eyes grow cold.It was strange. He thought it would be unfair enough for him to shed tears of blood, but he didn\u2019t feel bad. He rather felt relieved thinking that he could soon be freed from all this tedious work.So, what was so funny about him, who was about to die, who cared about the future anyway?It was them who didn\u2019t listen to his damn warning.Ah, I see. I was actually exhausted\u2026\u2026.As soon as he realized it, the blade fell from his head.Death was neither sweet nor painful.. . .Yuder was born in a small village in the corner of the Orr Empire.He grew up under his father and his grandparents, but then his parents died, and his grandfather also passed away when he was 13 years old. Since then, he took charge of everything on his own, digging up trees and herbs and selling them to fill the table with bread.Such a change in life occurred when he was 18, when the huge Red Stone fell from the sky one day and surprised the whole world.Fortunately, the stone that fell in a mountain range in the middle of the uninhabited Orr Empire, quickly overturned the entire land and filled the world with strange vibes.After that day, some of the ordinary people began to awaken strange powers. A child who had never held a knife could cut a rock with just a branch, and a common village maid could kill all monsters attacking the village with one finger.There was a strange energy that filled the world with the Red Stone falling on the foundation of all that power.Since they couldn\u2019t understand the situation, those people decided to believe that the energy filling the world was a kind of mana.There used to be mana in the world before. It was only then that very few of the chosen talents had to train for a very long time before they could feel and use it.It only existed.Very few were mages who belonged to the tower and studied for decades, or knights who were able to wield the sword after intense training.However, the new Awakeners did not have to put any effort into using their ability regardless of age or gender. Just as they were able to use their hands and feet from the beginning, so was their power.As a result, the structure of the world, which had been unchanged for more than a thousand years, began to change. There was a sudden tension between those who had previously held power and authority and those who had new power- the Awakeners.Over time, the tension continued to increase as it was revealed that if a person with power met certain conditions, they could develop beyond the level of their first awakening.Those in power in each country were worried about how to deal with the newly powerful ones.It was then the Orr Empire Yuder lived in had made a public announcement across the country, choosing to attract the awakeners to form a new organization.[Whoever has power, come to the capital by the Imperial Palace. If you can prove your strength to be true and swear to use it only for the Empire and the Emperor, no matter your standing you will be entitled to join the Cavalry!]T/N: I\u2019ve seen other people who read the book call them the Calvary and some call them the Demon Corps. The name will be used interchangeably by me depending on the contextThe announcement spread everywhere in an instant as if wings were stretched out. Even Yuder, who lived alone in the deserted mountains, found out.Among those who gained strange strength after the fall of the Red Stone was Yuder.One day, he was suddenly able to cut down trees without using an ax. He could cross the city without breaking a sweat. Without firewood, he could set the stove on fire, and without avoiding predators or monsters, he could move stones with one finger to attack them.But he didn\u2019t think he would have to show that power to others. He just thought he would live alone in a small hut where he lived with his grandfather all his life. However, his heart suddenly moved when he heard that he had gone to the market to sell trees.Gathering powerful men from the palace. It was an opportunity that ordinary commoners would never dream of.His grandfather left a will telling him not to be greedy and to live, but he was still young. The announcement seemed like a brilliant opportunity and a heart-rending adventure for him who was unable to take off his boyhood.It was a time when he didn\u2019t know yet that everything came with a price, and that he didn\u2019t really agree with those prices.Yuder packed his things and left home. If he didn\u2019t get accepted to the Cavalry, he would just go back home.The shabbiest accommodation he\u2019d ever had in the capital. In the accommodation which was about to collapse and had an inappropriate name called \u2018Giant\u2019s Sleep\u2019, Yuder opened his eyes again after apparently being decapitated by a guillotine.\u201c\u2026What the hell is going on?\u201dNo matter how much he looked into the dirty mirror, the way he saw it didn\u2019t change at all. Yuder looked at himself unfamiliarly in the mirror.A face that was still young, black hair with a grim coat. The neck that had been cut was clean without any incontinence. Cheap clothes made of rough cloth and shoes that were too big to wear were so realistic.Everywhere he looked, it was him after leaving home for the first time 11 years ago on his way to the capital.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWas everything that happened so far a dream? The whole lot of things that happened after he got into the Cavalry, and the cold sense of blade that ended up slashing his neck?If it was a dream, it would be a terrible nightmare. From the first day he came to the Capital, he just saw his future ending.\u2018But it\u2019s too detailed and realistic to be called a dream\u2026\u2019Did someone use magic to bring him back to 11 years ago? Or the power of God that felt sorry for his death?Turning back time was something no power-bearing follower could do. God often showed his power through his followers, but none of them were said to have been saved from death and sent back to the past.But if he really went back to 11 years ago, there were many chances for Yuder to undo the things he regretted.\u2018That\u2019s right, the future!\u2019He had thought he\u2019d lost it forever. When he realized it, his hands trembled with joy and surprise.He could do anything now. It was enough to leave the country and go somewhere else, building up his strength quickly, or even joining the damn Cavalry.\u2018\u2026 And maybe now I can figure out the cause of the global change and stop it.\u2019Yeah, it was not only about the Cavalry. Yuder recalled the things he had hung on to the brink of death.Years later, cracks slowly began to appear in the world. Starting with the climate changing and natural disasters that could be called calamity, God\u2019s power gradually hid its presence.Strange madness and disbelief that would haunt people as things that had never existed began to appear, and there were countless other things that would happen.It was something Yuder couldn\u2019t solve alone, but now countless people still lived and existed in the world. If he told them and asked for help in advance\u2026\u2018No\u2026Wait.\u2019The thought of running busily stopped for a moment. Yuder shook his head and realized there was a loophole in his opinion.The former Yuder had the power and authority that no one could ignore as the commander of the Empire\u2019s Cavalry, but now he was just a young boy who had just come to the Capital from the countryside. Who was going to listen to him anyway?\u2018They will never listen.\u2019The Cavalry was the first organization to start in the Orr Empire. It was possible because the former Emperor, who was now the current Emperor, had a very limited attitude towards Awakeners.No matter how strong he was now, it was still difficult to go to any country and be treated better than here.Other countries, which had been half-confident about the effect after the establishment of the Cavalry, realized years later that giving some power and status to Awakeners was much better than unconditionally suppressing them.And there were some places where similar organizations were belatedly established, but the timing was late, creating irreversible conflicts between the nation\u2019s leaders and Awakeners.Such countries had often entered the path of civil war because even late-made organizations could not be properly controlled.Therefore, the Cavalry of the Orr Empire boasted the most powerful status and reputation of any similar organization.The organization\u2019s commander, Yuder, was also always in the glare of envy and jealousy wherever he went\u2026As he recalled the past, Yuder briefly lowered his gaze toward the floor. He didn\u2019t want to think about those days.\u2018Anyway, there\u2019s no better place than here now\u2026 And there are the most appropriate people here to get help about what will happen in the future.\u2019Yuder knew that the magnitude of the force hovering around his body did not make much difference from when he just Awakened thirteen years ago.With this power, ordinary people could create miracles that they couldn\u2019t even dream of, but it was not comparable to the great masters of the Pearl Tower, who had been digging only a path for a long time.It was an eternal truth that the stronger someone was, the less they would listen to others. It was best known by Yuder himself who had lived like that.It took that strength and position to persuade such people to find and prevent future disasters that didn\u2019t happen immediately.\u2018Okay, let\u2019s get into the Cavalry for now. I can start after I make some other conditions.\u2019Yuder quickly accepted his reality and decided to dream of a better future than before.It was not a condition that would be an obstacle for him to return to a commoner with less power and nothing at all.He recovered an asset that couldn\u2019t be exchanged for anything called time. The important thing was that he was back from his terrible future and now he was standing here. That was all.Yuder stayed in his room all day and night to organize the information he remembered and thought about what to do in the future.He went out of the room in the morning of the third day after realizing that he had regressed eleven years back.\u201cHey, new guest. The innkeeper said you have awakened too.\u201dWhile Yuder was going down to wash his face, someone talked behind him.\u201cYou\u2019re here to take the test at the palace, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m the same. It\u2019s convenient to have a colleague to share information with, isn\u2019t it? Do you want to converse with me?\u201dYuder turned his head and opened his eyes wide without realizing it. He knew this person. Not now, but in the future.Red hair and vivid green eyes from the South. The colorful look was reminiscent of a rose and stood out.A man who quickly became a celebrity among those who passed the Cavalry with Yuder, he had been dispatched to suppress monsters and died in an accident early on.There was a lot of talk about the premature death of such a precious talent\u2026\u201cI\u2019m Gakane Bolunwald. And you?\u201dYeah, that was his name. Yuder opened his mouth quietly as he looked at the man\u2019s face, shining as fresh as in his revived memory.\u201cYuder.\u201d\u201cAlright, Yuder. I\u2019m going to have breakfast for now. How about you?\u201dHad he encountered Gakane before? Yuder looked back on his memory. It\u2019d been eleven years, so it was blurry, but he was sure he\u2019d never encountered him\u2026\u2018Oh, I did.\u2019When he was in the room preparing for the Cavalry test, he once had said hello, saying something similar to now.At that time, Yuder had refused at once because he had little experience mixing words with other people approaching him unnecessarily, and Gakane went back with embarrassment. After that, they had hardly encountered each other until his death.Before, he didn\u2019t like to treat others who might join the Calvary when he didn\u2019t even know if he would go home soon.The huge Capital city he had seen for the first time was filled with displeasure and vigilance instead of positive feelings for Yuder who had lived alone in the quiet mountains.But now that he saw him again, he thought Gakane might have been a pretty good person. It was not common for a person from a renowned family to voluntarily stay in such an old inn, not showing reluctance even though he would have heard his name and knew Yuder was a commoner without a home and last name.It was something he hadn\u2019t noticed eleven years ago.\u2018What was his power again? Only impressions remain that it was quite good, but I don\u2019t remember the details.\u2019\u201cAll right.\u201dYuder decided to dine with Gakane and learn more about him. It was meaningful that he was the first person he met after returning to the past.The story would bring back memories of the past, which were now blurry.\u201cI\u2019m going to order chicken stew and bread, and you?\u201dGakane spoke informally even though he might not know Yuder\u2019s age. Yuder had always been used to people being intimidated in front of him and couldn\u2019t even look at him, so he was quite impressed by his attitude.\u201cSame with you.\u201d\u201cOkay, you won\u2019t regret it. Here\u2019s your order!\u201dThe menu Gakane ordered was as good as his guarantee. It was a dish that he didn\u2019t even know what ingredients were being used in such an old inn, but it was quite delicious.\u201cHow do you like it? Is it good?\u201dGakane asked with a cheerful smile. Yuder nodded as he put the stew in his mouth.\u201cI\u2019ve tried all the menus here, but this combination is the best. They put in a lot of meat and bake bread every morning. I\u2019m glad to see you, comrade.\u201dIt had been a long time since he thought food was something other than just edible. He felt strange.\u201cI\u2019m from Southern Ulan. I came here a week ago. I was worried if I could make some friends before I went to take the test, but I think it\u2019s a relief that I met you.\u201dGakane was quite sociable. Yuder felt comfortable to keep his mouth shut when he saw the green eyes that wanted answers from Yuder after telling him where he was from.\u201cI am from the central.\u201d\u201cCentral? Where? Quan? Bellec? Or\u2026\u201d\u201cAiric.\u201dYuder said the name of his hometown after such a long time. As in the past, his last name \u201cAile\u201d he had received once he was accepted into the Cavalry was named after his hometown.Of more than 300 successful applicants, all of the commoners were given their last names, so most of them were not sincere with their names. Since then, the depth of sincerity was different from \u201cYudrain\u201d side, which was made and given with care similar to the original name when he became the commander of the Cavalry.\u2018This time I will not be the commander of the Cavalry, and I will not be given that name again.\u2019\u201cAiric? You mean the place near the Ric Mountains?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAiric? You mean the place near the Ric Mountains?\u201dGakane couldn\u2019t tell what Yuder was thinking and seemed surprised hearing Yuder\u2019s hometown name.\u201cYou know of it?\u201d\u201cHow could I not know? The Red Stone fell in the Ric Mountains!\u201d\u2018That\u2019s right.\u2019\u00a0Yuder smirked. The place where the Red Stone fell was quite aways from where Yuder lived, so he couldn\u2019t see the scene in person. However, the whole sky had turned red and he could hear a loud roar enough to shake the heavens and earth.At that time, he was surprised and thought that the world had suddenly collapsed. It resulted in severe damage to a small village where Yuder often sold trees.\u201cThen did you happen to\u2026 see the Red Stone?\u201dSince Gakane only heard rumors, he asked with curiosity. Yuder fumbled about what had happened in the past and nodded casually.\u201cReally? You saw it?\u201dGakane jumped and shouted. His face turned red with excitement.Only then did Yuder realize that he should have answered that he hadn\u2019t seen it eleven years ago, but he had already nodded his head.\u201cI heard that His Majesty the Emperor\u2019s knights made guarding camps so that no one could enter. How did you see the stone? Did it fall near where you live? Did you see the stone? What size?\u201d\u201cWait, I\u2026\u201dYuder hesitated for a moment about what to say. Did he see the Red Stone? Of course he did. But it was in the future at this point after he joined the Cavalry.The stone had been collected by the first commander of the Cavalry. And after that, the archmages of the Pearl Tower had cut and refined the impurities over a year.Since then, the stone has been called the \u2018World Sphere\u2019. The name was given to mean that it had the power to support the world.The fact that the stone gave Yuder a decisive reason for his death actually calmed him down.\u201cI didn\u2019t see it in detail. As you said\u2026 the knights are guarding it.\u201d\u201cBut didn\u2019t you say you saw it?\u201dGakane was persistent. He was so adamant to listen to it somehow.\u201cIf I have to keep it a secret, I will never tell it to anyone else. I swear on my sword, on the Temple, and on my mother. I will do anything you ask me to.\u201dWas Gakane Bolunwald always this kind of guy? Yuder felt his faint impression of him was collapsing considerably.No matter how distant he looked, he was a young man who couldn\u2019t hold back his curiosity. Yuder sighed quietly and opened his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s not so great that you should make such an oath.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s not something great, you can just tell me.\u201d\u2018If you don\u2019t listen to me now, you\u2019ll find out about it after you get accepted to the Cavalry. You\u2019re so persistent.\u2019After thinking so, Yuder recalled that Gakane was already dead by the time the Red Stone was acquired and returned to the world.Then suddenly, the young man in front of him seemed a bit pitiful, making him feel a bit of sympathy. Yuder hesitated and began to speak.\u201cIt\u2019s a normal stone. It looks just like any other stone, and it\u2019s about the size of a fist.\u201dHe wouldn\u2019t mind telling him this much. Gakane opened his eyes wide at Yuder\u2019s words.\u201cIs it that small? Then how do you know it\u2019s the Red Stone? I thought its color would be red because the name is \u2018Red Stone\u2019.\u201dYuder raised the corners of his mouth faintly so that it wouldn\u2019t be noticed. Everyone had the same imagination. Yuder also thought so eleven years ago.The reason why the name was \u2018Red Stone\u2019 was because the whole sky was colored red when it fell. When someone faced the stone, they would only need a glance to feel that there was unusual energy coming from it. That was why anyone could immediately tell its identity.For average people, the stone was so overwhelming with energy that they couldn\u2019t even approach it.\u201cI don\u2019t know that.\u201d\u201cSo you don\u2019t know. Well, I\u2019m curious. We will know when we join the Cavalry, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYuder ate the stew without saying anything. Gakane also closed his mouth as if he didn\u2019t want an answer to that question.\u201cOh, right. Did you finish registration? You have to register for the test to join the Cavalry. Do you know how?\u201dBy the end of the meal, Gakane suddenly looked up. Yuder nodded.\u201cI know.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t known before. There was no one who was willing to tell the poor country bumpkin with a grim impression like himself in detail. Therefore, it was not until the day before the registration was completed that the application for the test was received separately.He had vivid memories of the silly days when he had lost his way in the wide Capital while trying to find a place to receive the applications.\u201cYou have to get to the Blue Crown. When I went there, it was actually quite far to walk from here. It would be much easier if you\u2019re guided by me than getting lost. So how about it?Perhaps because Yuder told him about the Red Stone, Gakane\u2019s expression was full of goodwill. How long had it been since he received such a pure favor without any conditions? It was very awkward, but as he tried not to show it, Yuder looked at him quietly.\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dGakane smiled widely. The handsome man also smiled. Yuder thought the world was unfair after a long time.***The Blue Crown was not far from the palace. It was a workplace for officials mainly in charge of administration.Actually, there were quite a number of theories as to why it changed to a rather strange nickname, \u201cBlue Crown\u201d, even though it had a long formal name, Paklamannuteia. The theory was because part of the roof was blue, and some blue rose patterns were painted on the road leading to the largest entrance.However, the most received theory was because the paint ink that the administrators used to sign documents was a special blue color.Standing in front of the huge building built in an antique style, Yuder felt a mixture of emotions. His life had changed for the first time in that door.\u201cFortunately, the line isn\u2019t that long today. Let\u2019s get right in.\u201dGakane was looking at the people queuing in front of the entrance, nodded his head and took the lead.Those who had come to the test had to stand in line to apply. It was because there were only a few receptionists compared to the many who wanted to apply.In the past, Yuder was lucky to jump in and register just before the registration time ended, but not this time. As they approached the end of the queue, the woman right in front of them turned her head.\u201cHello. Are you guys applicants?\u201dShe looked angry and her speech was stiff as if she was arguing. Yuder had no memory of this woman. She was probably one of those who came here because she had the ability that couldn\u2019t be used in real life, or because she thought she had awakened her ability.This was the first recruitment of Cavalry, so there were countless of such people. It was a question that would\u2019ve been ignored, but Gakane kindly answered.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve already registered, though.\u201d\u201cReally? You\u2019re here to help the man next to you?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201dThe woman glanced back at Yuder who was standing next to Gakane.\u201cThen you know what to answer when you apply. By any chance, can you tell me? I was so nervous about it that I couldn\u2019t eat anything since this morning.\u201dOnly then did Gakane\u2019s eyes soften even more because he realized that her stiff expression was actually from being nervous.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much. Name, age, origin, whether you have a second gender, then you can explain your second gender, and the most important is your ability.\u201dSecond gender was literally one\u2019s second gender, aside from the visible gender of women and men.It was also a new feature that began to emerge after the Red Stone fell. Initially, it was seen as God\u2019s curse because it was expressed arbitrarily regardless of the first gender. However, people\u2019s response then changed after it was revealed that most of the changes were only made to those who awakened their abilities.The Orr Emperor and Pope officially announced the decision to set it as\u00a0\u201cA second gender gifted by God\u201d.\u00a0And the general public who had been terrified knowing their bodies would change was greatly relieved.Whatever the first gender was, the second gender named \u201cAlpha\u201d could impregnate another second gender named \u201cOmega\u201d. They were able to pair up with others to make their offspring, but most of those with a second gender felt sexual attraction to each other only.At first glance, it didn\u2019t seem like much other than this concise matter. But as time went by, more and more things were revealed, and new discrimination grew between them.Those identified as \u201cAlpha\u201d were usually admired by everyone because they had exceptionally good physiques and strong Awakening abilities, but those identified as \u201cOmega\u201d were weaker than ordinary Awakeners who didn\u2019t have a second gender.Both Alpha and Omega\u2019s rut and heat passed relatively quietly. However, compared to Alpha\u2019s rut, Omega\u2019s heat released a strong scent that even non-awakeners could smell. They were criticized as an animal who couldn\u2019t resist sexual desire and were secretly despised.Because of their scents, many Omega had been used as sex toys for nobles. They had been kidnapped and treated like precious and unusual things because of their inability to work properly as capable people.By the time Yuder died, most of those identified as Omega couldn\u2019t enter the Cavalry. It was because of the discriminatory perception that they would be useless thieves even after passing the entrance test.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It did not manifest until he was accepted into the Cavalry, but it suddenly began several months later.T/N: For those that don\u2019t know what the omegaverse is, this is a quick crash course: LinkThere had been countless people over the years who had disapproved of the fact that an Omega was the Commander of the Cavalry. So many of the fellow Awakeners did not want to acknowledge him in that position.They couldn\u2019t drive Yuder out openly because he had the strongest power than any Alpha, and he was the only scent-free Omega that didn\u2019t experience heat.But the only one with such ability was Yuder, so no matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t even stop discrimination and crime against Omega.\u2018Will I manifest at the same time this time around?\u2019Someone who hadn\u2019t manifested a second gender couldn\u2019t detect another person\u2019s second gender. Therefore, Yuder did not know whether Gakane in front of him, or the woman he was talking to, had any second genders.\u201cDo I have to demonstrate while explaining my\u2026 \u2018ability\u2019?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t sure. The woman\u2019s expression changed more seriously when she heard Gakane saying so.\u201cThat\u2019s going to be a problem\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy is that so?\u201d\u201cMy ability is\u2026 well, it needs to be prepared. I can\u2019t even see the results right away.\u201d\u201cDo you have such ability? Usually, everything is visible\u2026 I heard it\u2019s like magic and sword.\u201dGakane tilted his head. However, Yuder did not question the statement at all. Although it was not well known that many early Awakeners had unusual abilities, there were still various kinds of abilities out there.Over the years, the number of Awakeners would increase, and more diverse people would emerge. However, the number of those\u00a0 who were capable was very small, and they usually died quickly because they did not have the ability to protect their bodies.If she met an official who did not understand her ability even though she was a proper competitor, the application itself could have been rejected. Yuder suddenly felt a surge of interest in her.\u201cWhat kind of ability?\u201dThe woman turned her head surprised when Yuder, who had been silent so far, suddenly talked to her. She gave a hesitant look, but she answered shortly.\u201cI can read information from what I touch.\u201d\u201cInformation? How is it possible?\u201d\u201cWell, for example, if I hold an object in my hand, suddenly information about it comes into my head. If it is a book, it would contain things such as who wrote it and what is inside. Though not all things are possible, I think it is only possible when I have information to read. There is almost nothing to read about new things. And the older the thing is, the more information is available for me to read, the longer time it takes. That is what I\u2019ve figured out so far.\u201d\u201cWow.\u201dGakane exclaimed. He looked half-confident.\u201cCan you read people, too?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s never been successful.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s real.\u2019Yuder read her eyes that she meant it.\u2018But she can\u2019t make up words. It\u2019s the perfect ability that feels like a scam. In the past, she probably couldn\u2019t even apply and got rejected.\u2019The ability to read information about objects in her hand. At first glance, he couldn\u2019t feel how great it was.But what if the ability could be further developed at this level? What if she could read people, nature, and finally read invisible things?\u2018Everyone\u2019s going to want it.\u2019It could be a scary weapon beyond just great. It was an ability to kill or save people depending on who their superiors were.Thinking so far, Yuder suddenly recalled some information he had heard and forgotten in the past.\u2018And it turns out that a few years ago\u2026 The King of Duvern ever said that he had an Awakener who could read the future?\u2019Duvern was a neighboring kingdom of Orr Empire, bordering on the west.Yuder had been nervous at that time, feeling the world situation became dark when he heard about the king talking about having an Awakener that could read the future. He then had ordered one of the Cavalry members to visit there.But all the returnee reported was very little information that the future-reading Awakener had already died in Duvern\u2019s political strife, and that the Awakener was originally from the Orr Empire.At that time, he thought there would be no way the Awakener who could read the future would die in vain like that, so he judged it as false information and forgot it.But if there was someone who read information about things like the woman in front of him, there might also have been someone like that Awakener.Perhaps now she could only read the past, but if her ability developed, she could read into the future.Yuder needed information. More information than he had known in the past. In order to do so, it was\u00a0necessary\u00a0for those who had the ability like the woman in front of them to join the Cavalry.Yuder looked at how many people were left in front of the line. There were still about seven people.That was still plenty of time.When he put his hand in his pocket and searched, he caught something familiar. When Yuder took out the old bracelet from his pocket, the woman and Gakane looked back at him curiously.\u201cWhat is with that?\u201d\u201cRead this.\u201dThe woman received the bracelet she had just given out and looked confused.\u201cWhat? All of a sudden\u2026 I told you that my abilities don\u2019t work for everything\u2026 Huh?\u201dThe woman who had been saying something suddenly stopped. Yuder saw hazy energy rising from her whole body. It made everything clear. She definitely had an ability awakened by the power of the Red Stone.\u201cIt was an old man who made this. Your grandfather?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAlright. About 7 years ago\u2026 You got it before he died. Yu\u2026der. Yuder? Is that your name?\u201dInstead of answering, Yuder raised the corners of his mouth dimly.\u201cYour ability is real.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBut the officials probably won\u2019t believe it.\u201dThe woman\u2019s expression stiffened by Yuder\u2019s cold words. Gakane opened his mouth as if he was too much. Yuder quickly continued before they responded.\u201cSo, when they ask you to explain your abilities, don\u2019t do what you told us. Just say that it has very big destructive power.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dBoth the man and woman tilted their heads in unison.\u201cThe officials just need to file the application. They won\u2019t have to check the ability that seems hard to be checked indoors. Actually, the information that you read is a very good ability to destroy your enemies depending on how you use it, so you\u2019re not lying. When you take the test yourself, you can tell the examiners there about your ability properly and ask them to bring you anything old, so for now, you can only succeed in accepting applications. If you don\u2019t apply that way, you won\u2019t have a chance.\u201dYuder\u2019s voice was very calm, with few highs and lows. However, the content of his words in that calm voice contained sharpness that no one had ever thought of.A trick would be a trick, but it was definitely not a lie. Gakane and the woman felt the same curiosity because he seemed to know the test process very well, but soon the surprise took over.\u201cT-that\u2019s awesome. But is that really okay?\u201d\u201cIt depends on how much you want to join the Cavalry.\u201dHe would never have said that to others before. But after going through the same process as them, he became a member of Cavalry. And when he saw all the abnormalities of the world, he had died. He changed his mind when he regressed.For Yuder now, people like Gakane and the woman felt like new yet very young Awakeners in the Cavalry he was responsible for. Those who didn\u2019t know what the future held before them, so there was still a chance.It was a kindness by necessity, but on the other hand, he was a little bit bitter because he didn\u2019t seem to have completely escaped the heart of a Cavalry Commander.\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. Officials are just for applicants and not examiners. If we don\u2019t get in, we won\u2019t have another chance.\u201dGakane tapped Yuder on the shoulder with an admiring look. The woman thought for a moment and nodded as if she had made up her mind.\u201cI will have to do that. Thank you for the advice. I\u2019m late for an introduction, but my name is Kanna.\u201d\u201cThis is Yuder as you read earlier, and I\u2019m Gakane Bolunwald. I hope we can all register safely and get accepted to the Cavalry and meet again.\u201dKanna smiled with a much relaxed expression at Gakane\u2019s words.\u201cYeah, just those words will be fine.\u201d\u201cNext, come in.\u201dThen they finally heard a voice announcing Kanna\u2019s turn. Before they knew it, there was no one in front of them. Kanna exhaled deeply, waved her hand, and went inside. The entrance and exit were designed separately, so it was no longer known whether she would have to see them again or not.If she succeeded in applying, she would be lucky to meet them at the test site or the Cavalry. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be able to see them.\u201cYuder. You\u2019re not nervous, are you?\u201dGakane asked Yuder with a strange look while he was thinking he should\u2019ve found a better way to contact Kanna in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI was actually quite nervous.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not. I\u2019m alright.\u201dWhy would he be nervous about something he\u2019d already experienced once with an obvious result? But he couldn\u2019t say that, so he swallowed his words.\u201cI don\u2019t think you really know. More than anyone I\u2019ve ever seen\u2026 I\u2019m sure you will pass the Cavalry test right away.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I will pass.\u201dGakane gave a brief blank look at Yuder\u2019s answer. And soon he couldn\u2019t hold back and burst into laughter.\u201cPfft. What is that? Do you have the ability to see the future? What about me? What do you think I\u2019m gonna be like?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have the ability to see the future, but I think you will pass.\u201dGakane laughed even louder.\u201cOh, by the way, you\u2019ve said all these pleasant things with that look on your face. Thank you.\u201dHe seemed to think it was empty words, but Yuder was telling the truth. Gakane would really pass through to the Cavalry.He wanted to say something more to Yuder, but he couldn\u2019t because he heard a call from inside.\u201cOkay. Get in there. I will be waiting at the exit.\u201dYuder tried to say that he could go without waiting, but Gakane was faster to turn around. Yuder stepped into the Blue Crown. The application would be finished soon anyway. The important thing was the test after the application.***The test was not conducted at one time every day because of the large number of people wanting to join the Cavalry. Once the application was completed, the test was conducted on the site of the Imperial Knights for three days. And whether or not the test was passed was immediately determined.Yuder was instructed to take the test on the third day, the last day, and Gakane took it the day before. He didn\u2019t come back to the inn, so he seemed to have passed just like before. Yuder took his simple luggage bag and left the inn with it on his shoulder.The Imperial Knights site for the test was not far from the inn. A training camp on the site of the Imperial Knights, consisting of several tall buildings, was the place where applicants would join the Cavalry.Yuder looked at the tense faces of those hovering around the building and identified several familiar faces. They were the faces of those who would pass the test.\u201cYour turn number 423!\u201dCountless people were called into the building. Now it was Yuder\u2019s turn. Yuder walked leisurely into the building that hadn\u2019t changed from his memory.Now the test was only conducted by renting a training center for the Imperial Knights, but a few years later, the position of Imperial Knights and Cavalry would be completely reversed.The knights who were mostly ordinary couldn\u2019t beat even the natural Awakeners. The commander of the Cavalry continued to be trusted by the emperor and was given half of the buildings once owned by the Imperial Knights and half of the newly built buildings to show off their prowess.\u201cI am number 423.\u201dAfter following the guide, Yuder faced the five test-examiners. He hadn\u2019t known before, but now he could see most of their faces. From the left, the deputy commander of the Imperial Knights, the assistant of Chancellor Mooker, a mage sent from the Pearl Tower, the court mage, and\u2026The moment he saw the man sitting on the rightmost side, Yuder\u2019s eyes changed. Unlike the other four, he was a man of ordinary impression, dressed in clothes that showed no characteristics of his position.The other participants might not have felt any peculiarity in that man, but Yuder was different.The man\u2019s face was a fake, elaborated with magic. Yuder had seen the face, which was deliberately made ordinary so that it wouldn\u2019t remain in other people\u2019s memory, a long time ago.\u2018That face, no way.\u2019\u201cNo. 423. You wrote a very grand description in your ability section. Is this all true?\u201dWhile Yuder couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the man on the right, a sharp question awakened his mind. The Pearl Tower\u2019s mage was waving Yuder\u2019s application form with a frown on his face.\u201cYou can create fire and water on a sword? I\u2019ve never heard such nonsense in my life.\u201dIn the past, they used to say that to his application form. Yuder at that time was angry because he was still young,\u00a0but not anymore. He fully understood why they had such a reaction.Until the Awakening, magic was once very careful and difficult to use because it was very hard to train. Not only that, it was also difficult to accumulate mana in the body and use it through complicated processes based on it.Therefore, mages mainly dug into one type of magic that was mostly the easiest to use to achieve even a little faster.It had already been more than a thousand years since using fire magic only or water magic only was the standard.Learning the magic of different natural attributes together took too long to get used to and learn how to move the mana, and above all, it was very dangerous because the mana built up in the body might collide.Therefore, a mage that could use more than one magic attribute was often treated as a story that appeared in a novel.Of course, it was just a story before the Awakening.Among those awakened by the power of the Red Stone, many dealt with various elements. Of course, proficiency and power differed widely, but it was clearly a break from the existing common sense.And among them, Yuder was the best. He handled all the elements freely and knew he would turn every weapon in his hand into something more powerful. Putting attributes on a sword was not a simple job.\u2018Truthfully, even what I said about fire and water is not all of what I\u2019m capable of.\u2019In fact, in the past, he only said he could handle all attributes, but he didn\u2019t say it could be put on a sword. It was after several stages of development he learnt that he could put attributes on weapons.If he had told them all his ability, he would have been eliminated at the application stage because no one would\u2019ve believed it, so he needed some reduction, but he didn\u2019t want to go the same way as before.This was the result of such worries. Yuder believed this level of skill would make it easier for him to achieve his goal by standing out immediately after passing the test.When Yuder didn\u2019t respond to the mage\u2019s anger, the deputy commander of Imperial Knights who had been sitting on the left began to speak while touching his beard.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell when we\u2019re talking to each other until we see it in person. Yes, if what you said is true, show us. Make us believe it.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dYuder looked around. He was now bare-handed because he was not allowed to carry a personal weapon to take the test. Not far away, however, a blunt exercise sword and some tools were seen by the test examiners. He walked there without hesitation and picked up an iron sword.\u201cHmm.\u201dNo matter how much it was for practice, it was still a heavy sword that ordinary people could never hold.The examiners\u2019 atmosphere changed as he lifted the sword like a branch with his arms, which were not very muscular.Because it was a desired reaction, Yuder positioned himself in a place where they could see him with his sword well. The reason why he was able to hold the sword lightly was because he had the ability to handle natural attributes at will.If anything was made of nature beyond just the top five attributes, it could be moved in Yuder\u2019s hand just like his own hand and foot. Weapons were mostly made of irons, so it was natural.For that reason, when caught and tortured, he was dismantled by getting stabbed on the mana hole under the navel, the biggest vital point and weaknesses of all Awakeners.His arms and legs had been crushed and tied with a rope made of monster\u2019s tendons, not a creature from nature.Even so, he was somehow still alive until the day he was executed because he was an Awakener, nothing more or less.But now, Yuder\u2019s mana hole was perfectly fine and in perfect condition. Those in front of them didn\u2019t yet know how far his awakening could be.They were just watching without knowing how far Yuder could go with a blunt practice sword he was holding.\u2018Of course, I\u2019m only going to show you the right level for now\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t want to waste any time in the world that had regressed. Yuder wanted to pass with a decent impression, showing a level of power that overwhelmed the examiners but wouldn\u2019t exert himself.Thinking so far, Yuder\u2019s eyes glanced toward the man with a fake ordinary face on the far right.\u201c\u2026I will get started.\u201dYuder lifted the sword. Seeing all the examiners\u2019 eyes were drawn to the end of the sword, he slowly awakened his spirits. It\u2019d been a long time since he felt it, but he wasn\u2019t confused at all because the method was well imprinted on his head as easy as breathing.Hold onto the energy flowing around you. Then add it to the end of the sword you\u2019re holding, turn it into a fire. It was hard to explain because it was so naturally possible for Yuder, but the process was about that much.The sword blade was covered with flames in an instant. The heat was delivered to the examiners because it was much hotter and redder than usual so that they would feel the flame was real.Yuder held up the sword and slowly lowered it from the top to bottom. It seemed simple, but the power in it was never small.Some of the examiners were surprised and backed down to their chairs when the fire broke down with the sound of cutting the wind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHoo!\u201dIt was an act of forgetting dignity, but no one could blame them. It was such an amazing sight.Next was water. Yuder changed the energy around the sword. Then the fire melted down and a swirling stream of water wrapped around the entire blade. The sound of a whirlwind reverberated in the room.Yuder grabbed the sword and swung it a few times before slowly moving forward.\u201cThat is all I will be showing you, and I\u2019m going to prove that it\u2019s real water. Would anyone like to touch it?\u201dYuder watched as examiners agonized between curiosity and fear. Everyone was afraid of what they had never seen.They had seen a Swordmaster covering a sword with aura and an archmage dealing with attribute magic, but when the two were combined, even what they thought they knew, suddenly became unfamiliar to them.The examiners were all speechless. No one was willing to do so. Yuder waited. Eventually, when he tried to withdraw the sword, the examiner sitting on the far right opened his mouth for the first time. It was the man with a\u00a0fake\u00a0face.\u201cIf there is no one, then I shall do it.\u201d\u201cNo, you cannot. Your\u2026\u2026!\u201dAt that moment, the deputy commander of the Imperial Knights shouted with a frightened face and immediately shut up.\u2018Hmm. I guess my prediction is right.\u2019The deputy commander seemed to have barely held back his words because he thought he should not let others find out the identity of the rightmost examiner, but it only added confidence to Yuder.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. Relax. I am not \u2018that\u2019 one.\u201dThe examiner sitting on the far right smiled in a relaxed manner at the one who stopped me.If anyone other than Yuder were here, they would never have guessed why he seemed the most relaxed out of the rest examiners.Hearing his words, the deputy commander of the Imperial Knights opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but eventually, he sighed and shook his head.\u201cDo as you please.\u201d\u201cI think so. Something interesting came in after a while, isn\u2019t that the case?\u201dWho would fearlessly touch a sword wrapped in the stream of water and who would stop him? If he didn\u2019t know that one side was the deputy commander of the Imperial Knights, Yuder would ignore it without thinking much. But the meaning was different for those who knew.The Imperial Knights were mostly composed of high-ranking nobles. Born in an unmanned family that had served the imperial family for generations, it was the best place where only those who practiced hard holding a sword even before holding a spoon could barely come up through difficult tests.Of course, promotion could only be achieved when one was deemed to have both skills and family influence, meaning that a person who rose to the position of deputy commander of the Imperial Knights was from a family who could at least be a Count.Who would be the only one they bowed down to and stepped down to? The answer was simple.They were the royal blood, the royal family, born with the power of light that belonged to the Sun God.The royal family was all born with a striking appearance, with light-like blond hair and red eyes. The examiner in front of him would have used magic to change his appearance to be ordinary to hide it right away.In this world, there was magic called metamorphosis that was created to be used at times like this. Of course, it was very difficult magic, so he mostly never saw anyone who changed their appearance by using it. But Yuder knew a member of the royal family who used it as he wanted before.A weird royal family member who frequently changed his appearance. Yuder didn\u2019t know all of his appearances when in disguise, but he knew a few for sure. One of them looked just like the examiner in front of him now.\u2018If I haven\u2019t seen it, it would be difficult for me to guess. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen it, but it\u2019s still very sophisticated magic.\u2019He was Yuder\u2019s predecessor, Kishiar la Orr, the Duke of Peletta, the first commander of the Cavalry.Among the numerous crimes Yuder heard just before his death penalty was that he had killed him. The murder of Duke Peletta was one of the biggest suspicions that followed Yuder for a long time. It was also the only incident that remained a burden on his mind.Because it really was Yuder himself who took his life. It was the first mission under the order of the emperor\u2026\u2026.He never thought he would meet a man he killed with his own hands so soon. He thought he was the first person Yuder should meet when he joined the Cavalry, but he didn\u2019t expect him to be in the examiner\u2019s office.Yuder tried to calm down his complicated mood and held out his sword to the man rising from his seat.\u201cPlease just touch the water around it, not the blade.\u201dHe was polite, but his voice held no emotions, which made him sound a bit arrogant. The examiners thought so and looked at the commoner, saying,\u00a0\u2018How crazy\u2019.\u00a0But Yuder remained there with no change in expression.If the man Yuder suspected was indeed correct, he would never be angry. He\u2019d rather find it fun\u2026\u201cHahaha, it\u2019s fun.\u201dYes, just like that.The man reached out without hesitation while Yuder felt somehow strange. When he was sitting, Yuder didn\u2019t know, but when he stood upright, he was taller than anyone else here.It was hard to change one\u2019s physique even though one could change their face with transformation magic. Yuder added more confidence in his identity than he had suspected.Yuder\u2019s sword was big enough to look like a toy sword, but his movements were not dull at all and were surprisingly laid back and elegant.The moment the man\u2019s fingers touched the spinning stream of water wrapping around the sword, the examiners flinched their shoulders in unison.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd the water in his hands jolted like ordinary water and splashed vigorously everywhere.In an instant, there was water on Yuder\u2019s face, as well as on that man\u2019s hands and clothes.\u201cThat is real water.\u201d\u201cI told you so.\u201d\u201cHow dare you..!\u201dOne of the men couldn\u2019t bear listening Yuder\u2019s words and made a loud noise, but the man in front of him just raised one hand and squinted to shut him up. Yuder made eye contact with the man who looked down at him interestingly.The only real jewel-like red eyes in the mask under the guise of mediocrity.It was strange to see those red eyes shining vividly in front of him. He thought he had removed them forever\u00a0with his own hands. Did he feel this way for the first time he had seen him in the past? He didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t remember.\u201cThat\u2019s interesting, such a great ability. You\u2019re not as scared as I thought.\u201d\u201cIs it a failure if I\u2019m not scared?\u201dYuder ignored him and said only what he had to say. The man listened to Yuder and smiled softly with the corners of his mouth up.\u201cNo, of course, you are accepted. We cannot miss a talent like this, can we?\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dYuder took his energy from the sword. All that was left was to go out and head to the accommodation where the successful candidates would stay.\u201cNumber 423.\u201dBut just before leaving through the door, someone from behind called Yuder. The man with red eyes was smiling.\u201cI will remember you. I\u2019ll see you again.\u201dOf course, we will see each other again. You\u2019re the commander now.Yuder pushed the door out, feeling sorry that he couldn\u2019t answer like that.* * *A total of 330 Awakeners for the first recruitment since the establishment of the Cavalry. It was a huge number, but only natural because it was the first recruitment.The first recruitment was a time when they didn\u2019t know how to classify those Awakeners and what kind of people they needed in the Cavalry. Information about the Awakeners themselves was also ridiculously scarce.However, the number of successful applicants had decreased significantly since the second round of recruitment after such information accumulated as well as trial and error.Later, even though professional workers were allowed to recruit and take exams at all times, the number had decreased to the point where no one passed the exam in a month.But that was all about the distant future. The first successful applicants gathered at a huge indoor training ground with a mixture of joy and bewilderment.It was the only place where 330 people could gather in one place.\u201cThe commander will be here any minute. Keep your eyes on the heat.\u201dIt was not some fellow Awakeners, but the Imperial Knights who managed them. The organization was just built and there was no system, so there was nothing they could do.The knights could not get a look of disgust at the huddled Cavalry members. The Awakeners in their eyes were nothing but unidentified, vulgar, dirty lepers.Most of the Cavalry members who had just passed were intimidated by those gazes, but some of them were brave enough to turn over with a snort.\u201cLook at those eyes. If I swing my hand, they will die right away.\u201d\u201cI know right, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. If they put their sword against me, they will die without getting to swing it five times. But they are a nobleman and cannot be condescending.\u201d\u201cWeak but ugly.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t even know my specialty.\u201dThe knight\u2019s face standing solemnly guarding with a spear heard the whispers of a blue-haired man and woman who talked openly as if for him to listen. His face turned red. He gritted his teeth but couldn\u2019t answer at all because it was not the place.The new members who were intimidated by the appearance also cheered up to some extent. All of those were the same scenes Yuder had seen in the past.\u2018Hinn and Finn siblings. They used to be famous.\u2019The twin siblings, characterized by their blue hair, came from a family rumored to have mixed fairy blood among their ancestors and were hated by their superiors for their outstanding appearance and excellent ability but overly outspoken personality.However, Yuder heard that eventually within a few years, they would quit the Cavalry and return to their hometown.Unlike their innocent appearance, they were impressive with their unbelievable physical strengthening ability, so they remained in Yuder\u2019s memory.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yuder found noticeable red hair not far away. It was Gakane.He didn\u2019t seem to have found Yuder yet, but it was a little funny for him to keep looking around to find Yuder.\u201cHere comes the commander. Everybody, stand up straight.\u201dFinally, the outside was humming and someone stood on the podium in front of the training ground.Several knights followed him as if escorting him, but only one stood on the platform.The tall, blond, red-eyed man in a white uniform caught everyone\u2019s attention as soon as he appeared. Just standing there felt like everything was losing its light in an instant.\u201cNice to meet you. I am Duke of Peletta, Kishiar la Orr.\u201dA man who was like the sun. That was the real face of Kishiar la Orr when he did not use metamorphic magic.All 330 Cavalry members and the Imperial Knights could not take their eyes off Kishiar. He took a light glance around as if to make sure everyone was looking at him.Yuder saw his red eyes bent so thin that it was hard to mistake as soon as he saw him, but he didn\u2019t show any signs.\u201cAs you can see, I am a member of the imperial family born with the power of light and a duke. But does that mean anything to you all? No, that doesn\u2019t mean anything here.\u201dEvery time Kishiar\u2019s low voice rang in space, it felt as if it were possessed. Only the Imperial Knights were embarrassed.\u201cI\u2019m just a man awakened by the power of the Red Stone similar to you here. And I\u2019m a little more familiar with it than you are, so I\u2019m just a representative. The banner of the Cavalry is only the safety and strength of the Empire and your own freedom. That\u2019s more than enough. You may not know what that means yet, but I hope you will realize it someday.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBeyond the unconventional, everyone shut up at the almost shocking declaration. They couldn\u2019t even hear the sound of breathing.\u201cThat\u2019s it for the inauguration. In the future, we will rent the Imperial Knight\u2019s site for a while until the proper construction of the exclusive building for the Cavalry is completed. If you have any questions, feel free to visit the general manager\u2019s office. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cG-Greetings to the commander.\u201dThe Imperial Knight shouted, unable to hide his embarrassment. New recruits like baby chicks, who had not even learned a salute yet, greeted each other. The knights watched the scene as if it were absolutely terrible and let out a breathtaking sigh.The only person smiling there was Kishiar la Orr.* * *\u201cYou know the Commander-nim. He\u2019s a very strange man.\u201dAfter the shocking inauguration ceremony, the Cavalry members were guided to the temporary accommodation building. Based on their first and second gender, they were divided into four people and lived in one room.They heard a fairly blunt explanation that they should stay like that until the division of duties within the Cavalry was completed, but no one complained.It was because they were shocked by Kishiar at the inauguration ceremony, and they were curious to see people like them for the first time in their lives.\u201cYuder! You\u2019ve passed the test!\u201dYuder saw Gakane who finally found him among the new members, running like a puppy who found its owner.\u201cI passed, too. And Kanna did, too. Did you happen to see Kanna?\u201dApparently, he talked without using honorifics, but before he knew it, Gakane\u2019s affinity for Kanna who also spoke informally was quite surprising. As Yuder shook his head, Gakane patted his back pleasantly, saying he would soon be able to meet her.\u201cI can\u2019t believe all three of us passed, thanks to your guidance. Where\u2019s your room?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dYuder looked down at the paper in his hand. it said his quarter was located in the 36th room on the third floor of the building. Gakane looked at the paper as well and cheered quietly.\u201cIt\u2019s the same room as me. Who are the other two?\u201d\u201cWell, we will find out when we get there.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter to Yuder to share the same accommodation, but Gakane didn\u2019t seem to. He could not hide his excitement, saying he had never shared accommodation with someone like this.\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve become a real knight. Sleep together, train together. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s gonna be fun?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2018Fun, he says\u2026\u2019Yuder recalled the most difficult times in his memory. After joining the Cavalry for the first time, they would roll to death for about a month. It was a time when even what training methods were appropriate for each person with abilities were not formalized yet.Kishiar rolled the first members here and there literally like subjects to create the system. This allowed them to manage to become the systematic Cavalry in the next recruitment.Maybe this time wouldn\u2019t make a difference. Even if Yuder was in Kishiar\u2019s shoes right now, he would not come up with a good way to establish a better system than before.\u2018Let\u2019s see if he can say it\u2019ll be fun even after a week.\u2019It wasn\u2019t bad to return to the past, but it wasn\u2019t nice to think about doing hellish training again. Yuder himself knew best how to improve his ability anyway. There was very little physical rolling there.But he couldn\u2019t explain it to Kishiar, so he just hang in there.Two other men had already arrived at the accommodation heading for the same room with a sigh.\u201cAre you both our roommates?\u201dThe scrawny freckled man asked with a frightened face. His name was Juan and he said his ability was to be able to move at an invisible speed at the moment.\u201cI\u2019m Juan, and that is Kurga.\u201dYuder saw Kurga lying shamelessly on one side of the bed. He looked more like a bear than a human being.In fact, his ability was to maximize his combat capabilities by greatly inflating his body, so it was a fitting appearance.He remembered both of them passing before, but they weren\u2019t very good at it so they had never talked properly until he died.It was because Yuder and the other ordinary Awakeners were different from the standing position. He received the position of commander shortly after joining the Cavalry.In the past, he couldn\u2019t afford to pay attention to others who were less capable than him. Yuder\u2019s interests had always been to be stronger and to protect his limited body, and since the world\u2019s strange signs, he had been focused on finding out the cause and preventing them.But this time was different. He knew by death that it was something he couldn\u2019t solve alone, so he thought he would pay as much attention to his surroundings as possible and never be the commander of the Cavalry.\u201cI\u2019m Gakane, this is Yuder. My ability is to call out my shadow whenever I want, and his\u2026 Come to think of it, Yuder. I don\u2019t know what your ability is.\u201dYuder clearly remembered Gakane Bolunwald\u2019s ability, which he thought would be quite useful before.\u2018Yes, he was highly regarded for using the shadow as a liaison or conducting combat by pulling out the alter ego from the shadows.\u2019\u201cI can put fire and water on a sword.\u201d\u201cFire and water? Two?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201dThose listening to Yuder opened their eyes in unison. In fact, it would have been even more surprising if they learned that Yuder\u2019s ability could be more than that, but this was not the time to reveal it.\u201cOkay. I will be in your care from now on.\u201d\u201cUh, yeah. Me, too.\u201dThey greeted each other and divided beds and zones. There was no conflict because many people expected such a group life even before joining the Cavalry.\u2018It\u2019s like a dream to the commoners.\u2019Of the four who would stay in this room, all but Gakane were commoners without last names. It would have been a very strange experience for them to live in a spacious room with four beds, clean bedding, and meals.\u2018They\u2019ll get used to it soon.\u2019That was how his second experience in the Cavalry began.* * *Of the 330 Cavalry members, just over 200 were without last names.That meant that more than a majority didn\u2019t even know how to write. Before the Red Sone fell, they couldn\u2019t have met eyes with those with last names, but their fate had now completely changed.All training facilities that could only be used by the Imperial Knights were occupied by the Cavalry members.Every day, fireworks exploded on the training ground and instruments broke, but no one thought it was strange. It was natural for people who had abilitiesCommander Kishiar ordered the Cavalry members to train their physical strength, train them to familiarize themselves with their power, and train their individual skills at the same time, even studying letters.It was tremendous enough to burst into resentment, but everyone knew how much of a privilege this was, so they all moved according to the training schedule.Thanks to this, weeks later, the Cavalry members achieved remarkable results at a rapid pace.Of course, no one would follow Yuder, who did all that twice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018So far nothing has changed from the past.\u2019Of course, Yuder\u2019s roommates or Kanna\u2019s acceptance had changed from the past, but the faces of his roommates that he didn\u2019t remember at that time, and the degree of Kanna joining the Cavalry wouldn\u2019t affect the flow yet.Most of the current events in the Cavalry went as Yuder knew.There were only small incidents of the blue-haired twin siblings having a verbal fight with the knights passing by while cursing them out or a brief disturbance due to the powerful explosion caused by someone during training.\u2018And maybe the accommodation will change soon.\u2019They would move from the Imperial Knight\u2019s dormitory building where they were temporarily staying to the newly constructed building dedicated to the Cavalry. It became his real home for a long time until Yuder was imprisoned.After he had become the commander, the emperor offered him several houses because it didn\u2019t look good, but Yuder didn\u2019t go there.His house was always the small room in the top corner of the accommodation where the Cavalry members stayed.But this time he wouldn\u2019t be the commander, so he would never be able to stay in that room.Yuder let out a small sigh because he strangely missed the place that had not yet been built.\u201cYuder, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re already having a hard time?\u201dGakane, who was training next to him, asked in disbelief. He became a celebrity in the Cavalry for his outstanding appearance and sociability, but he still hadn\u2019t left Yuder\u2019s side.In addition, he had always talked about this and that next to Yuder regardless of his reaction. It was strange to deal with him like that.In fact, the most changed thing since Yuder regressed was his relationship with Gakane.But in the next year or so, Gakane would be on duty and get killed in an incident. The incident that used to feel casual had now occasionally haunted Yuder\u2019s mind.\u2018I intend to prevent the death of capable people as much as I can, so I plan to prevent Gakane Bolunwald\u2019s death, but\u2026\u2026.\u2019Was it possible? He\u2019d never twisted anything big enough to save a man destined to die. He didn\u2019t know whether he would succeed or not even if he tried. The consequences of things that did not happen were still unknown.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dYuder erased all thoughts from his head and got up again.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s how you are.\u201dWhat did he mean by it the way he was? Yuder seemed to have done the same things. No one had tried to make eye contact with Yuder before, but now Gakane in front of him was looking at him thoughtlessly. It was mysterious and strange.* * *A month later, the Cavalry members escaped from the temporary quarters and entered a new building properly built for the Cavalry. It was right next to the Imperial Knights\u2019 site.It was made in anticipation of training there, but the knights were furious that the Cavalry members, who they hated like bugs, had better accommodation than them.Yuder\u2019s roommates were the same as before, but the room was much bigger. So when each person lay in bed, the space between each other could be seen separately.After that, as he recalled, they would continue to change their ways, followed by intense training. There were no losers, but the wounded came out from time to time.The surprising thing was the commander, Kishiar, attended the same training as them. The members were surprised, but only Yuder was not. Because it used to be like that.\u2018It\u2019s not something that can be helped when the highest person moves directly to determine the way of training.\u2019Unlike the members who strengthened their comradeship with each other, Kishiar disappeared immediately after training, but the fact that he trained together with them encouraged everyone.After spending three months like that, Kishiar finally called in the Cavalry members again.They stood in front of the commander, looking the same and different. The biggest change was the officially paid black uniform.As more than 300 people gathered in it, looking similar to Kishiar\u2019s white uniform but had a much simpler look, the atmosphere was unusually heightened.\u201cFirst of all, I would like to thank all of you for following me well even though the training you have received has not been organized.\u201dKishiar was the first to greet briefly before bringing it to the fore.\u201cFor three months, I have tested your limits. The reason was to establish and complete the system of the Cavalry, and now it\u2019s over. So you have to make a choice based on your experiences.\u201d\u201cA choice?\u201dAsked Hinn, the older sister of the blue-haired twins. If the knights were here, they would have looked at her, saying she dared to ask the Duke back, but now there were only Kishiar and Cavalry members here. Kishiar nodded with a smile, with no sign of displeasure.\u201cYes. All of you will choose the divisions divided within the squad. The options are three in total: First is Shin division, the second is Sul, and the third is Jung.\u201dThe explanation that Yuder heard a long time ago was repeated again.Kishiar la Orr separated the huge group of Cavalry members into three smaller divisions. Shin division gathered those who focused on physical abilities; Sul centered on those who had magical abilities like Yuder, and Jung gathered other types of abilities.\u201cI am not asking you to choose here right now. Let me know by the end of the week.\u201dKishiar used the entire top floor of the new Cavalry lodge alone.It was not until everyone answered that the announcement was over.\u201cYuder, which one will you choose? Of course, it\u2019s Sul division, right?\u201dOn their way back to the dorm, Gakane spoke to Yuder.\u201cWhat about you?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t say for sure that that would be the case right now, so Yuder avoids to answer instead. Fortunately, Gakane did not doubt Yuder\u2019s intentions and immediately turned away.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about Shin and Sul, but I\u2019ve been training so far and I don\u2019t think this ability is going to end here. If I could get better\u2026 Maybe Shin division and I are a good match.\u201dYuder looked a bit surprised at Gakane for a moment. It had only been three months since they joined the Cavalry, and he had a hunch that he could develop his abilities.It was an extremely rapid development.It was still all the more so early that the researchers hadn\u2019t even announced that Awakeners\u2019 abilities could develop depending on their efforts and conditions.He didn\u2019t know because this guy died early, but in fact, Gakane\u2019s talent might have been better than Yuder had thought.\u2018Then which division should I join?\u2019Yuder was in agony. After three months of calm training, he was convinced that this situation was not a dream and that he could change the future if he did really well.In the past, he entered Sul division without hesitation and immediately became the deputy commander representing the Sul division. But that was not much different from the past. He wanted to avoid the consequences of repeating what was already set.\u2018Then the only thing left is Shin.\u2019Shin division\u2026\u2026Shin division was it. Yuder repeated the name several times.Although his greatest ability was handling all-natural attributes, he was also able to handle weapons freely. That was why he was likely not to fall behind even if he went to the Shin division.Of course, he might not make it to the position of Deputy Commander as before, but that was rather what Yuder hoped for.\u2018And if I join Shin division\u2026 Maybe I will see Kishiar la Orr more often.\u2019Yuder recalled Kishiar la Orr\u2019s ability. His ability, which no one knew so far, was specific to Shin division.\u2018Someone who is freely able to handle force and speed and good at defending physical and rapid attacks based on excellent physical control.\u2019The most special part was the \u2018body control\u2019.When he had joined the Sul division before, he barely met Kishiar, the commander, because he didn\u2019t have enough time to clean up after his subordinates as the deputy commander. It just so happened that they had met regularly later, but that\u2026 was not what Yuder wanted.But it would be different if he joined Shin division. Kishiar used to direct the training by taking care of the Shin division members frequently.Kishiar was an incredibly brilliant commander. Back in time, it felt more obvious.He did not form this group of Cavalry simply by short-term judgment. Every time Yuder saw everything he did, future events overlapped and he was speechless.\u2018But why the hell?\u2019Why did Kishiar la Orr hand over the commander position to Yuder at that time?It was as if he had planned to do it from the beginning without any worries.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dYuder also thought he would go to the Shin division and find out why.* * *Most of the Cavalry members finished choosing which division to belong to in less than three days.Even for those who initially had no idea, that the training and education they received over the past three months were enough to make objective judgments about their abilities to some extent.Those who expressed their physical abilities strongly went to Shin division, and those who expressed magical abilities went to Sul division. The abilities of neither two chose Jung division, which was less than 10 out of 330 members.\u201cYuder! Yuder! Hold on a second.\u201dAnd now Kanna, who was calling Yuder, was also one of the ten.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYuder! Yuder! Hold on a second.\u201dYuder stopped at her call as he tried to leave the school as soon as the tedious reading and writing classes were over.In the world before Yuder\u2019s death, Kanna was not in the Cavalry, but she was one of those who better adapted to the Cavalry more than anyone else.Maintaining some friendly relationships with everyone among Cavalry members, who varied in status, age, gender, and origin, was not usually done by ability alone.She had enough appeal to many people since she didn\u2019t say anything difficult about the hard training even though she had special abilities but her physical abilities were not very good. Just as her overly nervous face when they first met was like a lie, Kanna as a Cavalry member was praised for being sociable and competent.Kanna did not forget to thank Yuder for helping him the most in getting into the Cavalry. Although there were few occasions to meet because the training hours divided by the number of people did not overlap, they would always greet each other whenever they met.Thanks to Kanna and Gakane\u2019s mysterious experience of telling others about the test advice for Cavalry that Yuder had given, Yuder now became the subject of much more friendly attention from his comrades than in the past.In the past, he used to go around almost alone among Awakeners with the same power because he was quiet and grim, which was a very strange experience.\u201cWhew, it\u2019s so hard to meet each other.\u201dKanna, who called out to Yuder, was running out of breath and smiled.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s not a big deal. I was wondering if it\u2019s true that you haven\u2019t decided on your division yet.\u201dYuder looked at Kanna\u2019s blue eyes and nodded briefly.\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIs there a reason? The Commander was wondering.\u201dAt that word, Yuder paused for a moment.\u201cCommander?\u201dWhy did Kishiar la Orr\u2019s name appear here? Yuder\u2019s face, as he leaned back and asked, had such subtle emotions that Kanna could hardly notice.\u201cI went to the commander\u2019s room with Jodie since we were going to report on our division of choice. But he asked me if I had any idea which division Yuder would choose.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cActually, I thought you would definitely choose Sul division on the first day. Do you have any concerns? I\u2019m confident in reading information. If you need any advice, you can tell me anything. I\u2019ll help you for free if you need me.\u201dKanna sometimes used her ability at the behest of fellow members. The ability to read information about objects had been surprisingly helpful to people.The ability to regain what someone had forgotten, or to realize things someone did not know, felt similar to fortune telling.It was such a fascinating power that many would want to see it in person even if they had to pay for it. Everything was as Yuder expected.\u201cNo, thank you.\u201dBut Yuder never asked her for help. Not yet.The only thing that mattered to him now was to not stupidly lose useful human resources that had been forgotten in the past.\u2018But\u2026 I\u2019m a little concerned about that man\u2019s intentions\u2026.\u2019Yuder hesitated for a moment and started to speak to Kanna.\u201cDid he say anything other than that?\u201d\u201cOther than that?\u201dKanna glanced around and shook her head as if to recall memories for a moment.\u201cI don\u2019t remember much.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cMaybe because I\u2019m the one who talks to you the most, he didn\u2019t mean anything. It\u2019s only until tomorrow anyway, so don\u2019t feel pressured.\u201dKanna said, but Yuder didn\u2019t think so. She didn\u2019t know what Kishiar la Orr was like.The members usually had endless faith and affinity for Kishiar, who shared hard training and showed a fair attitude. But that man was not a very fair man. If they knew\u2026Yuder frowned as he recalled a few memories. The memories associated with that man usually didn\u2019t taste so good.\u2018But the fact doesn\u2019t change that he\u2019s the first person I need to save here and get on my side.\u2019He had killed that man with his own hands in the past, but not this time. He hadn\u2019t died yet, and he wouldn\u2019t. Not only that, but Kishiar also had to live to maintain his position as the commander of the Cavalry. That was what Yuder was going to do.Yuder pulled himself together. When he bowed his head lightly to say thank you to Kanna, there was a sign on her face that she wanted to see his face.\u201cOh, speaking of which\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dAnything else to say? As Yuder looked at her with the intention of saying so, Kanna frowned slightly.\u201cThe commander thinks that I\u2019m very close to you, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit too much for you to still not talk comfortably to me? Why do you keep speaking formally to Gakane and your roommates, Yuder?\u201dYuder was stunned for a moment by such a completely unexpected remark. It was the first time anyone had said that to him both in his previous life and even now. Why was he talking to someone and speaking formally to someone? It was\u2026\u201cBecause you spoke formally to me first, so I speak formally, too.\u201d\u201cWhat? So it doesn\u2019t mean that much?\u201dOf course, it was meaningless. Before and now, Yuder was always terrible at building relationships with other people. Perhaps because he had lived alone in the mountains for a long time.He was able to serve as the commander for nearly a decade because the Cavalry was a special group that could promote someone only by considering their abilities strengths and weaknesses.\u201cI actually cared a lot. I was curious about the reason. But if that\u2019s the reason, I\u2019ll talk to you informally from now on, okay? Everyone talks comfortably regardless of the conditions.\u201d\u201cDo as you please.\u201dKanna\u2019s expression brightened as Yuder answered slowly.\u201cOkay, I should have asked you earlier. It\u2019s so refreshing. I\u2019ll see you later!\u201dYuder looked from behind at the disappearing Kanna and turned his head.Since then, he had never imagined that many of the Cavalry members, who had not been able to talk to him properly because they thought it was difficult, would start speaking informally at once after hearing Kanna\u2019s words the next day.At that time, there was only one thought in Yuder\u2019s head. As soon as today\u2019s schedule was over, he would go to the place where Kishiar la Orr was staying and tell him that he had decided on a division. That was that.* * *The Cavalry\u2019s training was over by sunset. As soon as Yuder finished having dinner, he took off the clinging Gakane who urged him to play cards together and headed upstairs to the accommodation building instead.As he circled the stairs that seemed to run endlessly and reached the fifth floor, an antique white door with a golden mane of a lion\u2019s head as a doorknob appeared. It was a lion that swallowed light, the symbol of the imperial family.Yuder paused the moment he saw the doorknob. He felt a strange feeling.After Kishiar la Orr handed over the position of the commander to Yuder, he used the original shape of the room structure without changing anything.The only difference was that, unlike Kishiar who used the entire floor for personal use as a high-ranking person, Yuder changed the rest of the space except for one small bedroom into a publicly available place.People thought it was creepy to casually use the commander\u2019s space, which was rumored to have killed that man. But for Yuder, it was almost the only place where he could breathe without looking at others.If he opened that door, he thought the room he\u2019d used for nearly 10 years would appear right away. It felt familiar yet very unfamiliar.Yuder calmed down and put his hand on the doorknob. But before he could knock on the door, the door opened from the inside and a tall man appeared.\u201c\u2026 Hmm?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dKishiar, wearing a long coat over simple plain clothes, opened his eyes a little wide and soon returned to his usual expression.Yuder intended to visit with his heart fully prepared. But maybe because he encountered such an expected situation, he also felt his heart beating a bit loudly at the moment.It was the first time that he faced Kishiar properly since his regression, and it was also the first time that he saw him alone.When Yuder took the Cavalry test, he was able to maintain objective emotions because that man had transformation magic on his face. And there was no reason to pay much attention because he only saw that man\u2019s occasional glance among 300 Cavalry members.But now was different. Would he feel this way if he faced a monster waiting for him at a dead end where he couldn\u2019t find any other place to look away?Yuder looked up at Kishiar and took a deep breath. My heart, which had only been beating loudly, sank a little.The reason why Yuder kept finding these uncomfortable and unnecessary feelings even though he knew that man had no such thoughts was that he still had great memories of the past.Kishiar la Orr.Yuder had known him for less than two years, in fact. But his existence had left an indefinitely strong mark in Yuder\u2019s life, whether it was short or long.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKishiar la Orr had taught Yuder\u00a0many\u00a0things.How to stand in the position of commander of the Cavalry, how to stand in a court full of hyenas, and how to live as a capable person after awakening and as an Omega.In the past, he had felt resentful because he thought Kishiar had handed over too much baggage unilaterally to him, but by the time he died, he had changed his mind a little.Kishiar la Orr obviously chose Yuder as the commander of more than 300 members with a certain will. But what he had hoped for and chosen was still unclear.Did he hand over the position of Cavalry commander without knowing that Yuder would become a lion coming to take his life? Could he possibly not know the royal family and nobility circumstances that such an order would eventually come?Kishiar\u2019s ability would certainly have prevented him from dying and could have fled in advance or killed Yuder instead, but he did not. Yuder could not ask why he did it because he noticed it too late. The dead had no words.But now Yuder might know his meaning even without receiving his baggage as the commander. In order to do so, he should not let him die as before.\u201cI was wondering when the top accepted member of Cavalry would come, and now he has arrived. Have you finally decided on your division?\u201dKishiar talked leisurely with a smile. His tone was too comfortable for a noble of the imperial family to speak to a commoner, but Yuder was not surprised. Because he already knew this man had that kind of personality.\u201cYes, but if you\u2019re about to leave, I will be back next time.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t really have a scheduled occasion, I was just about to go out for a while and come back.\u201dKishiar took a few steps back and smiled.\u201cCome on in.\u201dYuder had a rare experience of stepping back as a guest in a place he had been using for a much longer time. Although the building was built at short notice, it was a place where engineers could feel traces of their efforts to meet dignity as much as possible, considering that it was a place for the imperial family member to stay.The top-of-the-line carpet from the southern mountain was tightly laid under the ceiling that soared in a round dome, and the central fireplace, which collected and burned magic stones from the north, looked more like a beautiful statue than a fireplace.The majestic bookshelf filled one side of the wall and the black basalt desk beneath it was dignified enough that no ordinary people would dare to touch it.What about the beauty of dozens of famous paintings based on old myths handed down to the Orr Empire?The white annular wall with the paintings shone brilliantly without light. Visitors who saw the sight fell into the same wonderful feelings as when they stood in front of the temple altar.Of course, Yuder, who was so familiar with the landscape here, only took a glance and was not surprised at all.Instead, his gaze was on the top of the burning fireplace sprinkled with red and blue light.Looked like it was floating in the air, Yuder saw a sword sheath made of fully transparent jewels and a huge sword supporting it.\u2018Orr Divine Sword.\u2019At a glance, it was not a sword that could be used by ordinary people. Even though it was contained in a collection of all kinds of sacred forces, mana, and techniques of different races, the energy itself was unique.The sword, which seemed to be sharp enough to cut him just by looking at it, was a divine sword that the first emperor who founded the Orr Empire was said to receive from the messenger of God.The sword could not be lifted without the blood of the imperial family. But even if it could be lifted, it wasn\u2019t something that could be used.That divine sword was famous for being picky about its users\u2019 abilities and qualities. Less than ten people in history were able to use that sword.And Kishiar la Orr was the only human of his time to be chosen by the Orr Divine Sword.After his death, a man who could wield the sword did not reappear even until the day Yuder died.A high-regarded sword that even the confident Yuder could not touch. No one but the chosen could move the sword. That was why, after Kishiar la Orr died, it was left forever at the Peletta Duchy, where Kishiar stayed at the end.With such a tricky story, not many people, including the nobles, knew what the divine sword actually looked like. It was only natural that Kishiar did not carry or use it often even after it was revealed that he was chosen by the divine sword.Why did the divine sword choose Kishiar when it would not be used properly by the owner it chose? Would it have made the same choice if the sword had known that it would be separated from its owner so quickly?Sometimes Yuder got curious, but it was something he never knew just as much about as Kishiar\u2019s will.\u201cIs the sword amazing?\u201dKishiar spoke to Yuder, who was only looking at the sword.\u201cUsually, people get distracted by other parts of the room first, so they don\u2019t care much about the divine sword.\u201dIndeed. It was not a reaction that ordinary commoners would have.Yuder murmured in his mind. Although that sword is the legendary divine sword, it was nothing more than an ordinary ceremonial sword for those with a high reputation.In fact, it did not look like a sword that could be used in practice, and the scabbard was so large and colorful that no one would normally give attention to the sword first.\u2018But that sword used to bother me the most.\u2019Yuder recalled something a long time ago. Now that he knew the appearance and ability of the divine sword and the future events involved in it, of course, his gaze went there, but even before the regression when he saw the sword for the first time.It was possible because Yuder was sensitive enough to feel mana to even look inside the divine sword\u2019s scabbard that hid its energy. Kishiar was the first to show great interest in Yuder at that time.Only then did Yuder turn away from Orr Divine Sword and turn to Kishiar. That man looked at Yuder still, gently rising up the corners of his mouth with a look that was hard to understand.So far, he was interested in Yuder, who\u2019s a little out of the ordinary, but that was just a look.\u201cIt seemed to be a sword with an unusual feeling, so I just looked at it.\u201d\u201cUnusual? Which part?\u201dAt this time, Kishiar had not yet publicly revealed that he was the owner of the divine sword. It was not long before he took on a top-secret mission to collect and bring back the Red Stone that he was revealed to be the divine sword\u2019s owner.So now it was important to stimulate Kishiar\u2019s interest while pretending not to know properly.\u201cJust looking at it makes me feel like I\u2019m being targeted. The scabbard is blocking it, but it can\u2019t seem to hide it completely.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t lying. In fact, he was still feeling the sharp energy flowing out of the sword.\u2018I think it\u2019s a lot stronger than I used to feel\u2026 Am I mistaken?In the past, he had felt an unusual energy from the sword, but even if he stayed still like this, he couldn\u2019t feel it in his whole body.Back then, Yuder was strong enough to be told that he would no longer have a rival in the world. Did the sensation become more sensitive than the original level due to the fact that the time had regressed? It was unknown.Kishiar\u2019s gaze turned toward the sword after hearing Yuder\u2019s comment. After a while, the energy toward Yuder diminished like a lie.\u201cHmm. Do you feel the energy has decreased?\u201dPerhaps he saw Yuder\u2019s shoulders go still, so Kishiar began to speak with an interested look.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re not lying.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a sword with such power before.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of it?\u201dFor a moment, he wondered if Kishiar had noticed something. Even though he knew it couldn\u2019t be, Yuder was nervous for a moment.\u201cEveryone knows the story of Orr\u2019s First Emperor and his holy sword.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah.\u201dIt was a useless worry. Yuder nodded, exhaling a small breath.\u201cSo do you mean that is the sword?\u201cYes, to be exact, I\u2019m the 12th owner. He\u2019s a fastidious guy that won\u2019t move except for the one he let touch.\u201dIt was a story that he already knew. But Yuder looked a little surprised, like a stranger. Kishiar continued the story without much doubt about the reaction.\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of people Awakened by the power of the Red Stone, but I\u2019ve never seen anyone as sensitive as you. Was it ever since you Awakened? Or have you ever felt more sensitive to energy than others in your daily life?\u201d\u201cSince\u2026 Awakening.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dKishiar rubbed his lower lip and nodded.\u201cNow that you are here, I was there as an examiner when you first came to the test as number 423. Do you happen to know that?\u201d\u201cYou were on the rightmost seat.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re so sensitive to energy that you can tell exactly what it is. It\u2019s a rare talent.\u201dYuder recognized him not because he was sensitive to energy, but because he had seen Kishiar change into that appearance before, but decided not to reveal the truth.\u201cAt that time, I thought your talent was rarely suitable for both Shin and Sul divisions. But if I had to choose, I thought it would be Sul\u2026 Am I wrong?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAm I wrong?\u201dIn the past, he said something similar and different to Yuder, who briefly said he would come here faster than anyone else and apply for Sul Division.\u2018Your ability is fit for the Jung division. It\u2019s good to know the direction of your ability before anything else.\u2019How strange it was to hear different things from the same person in the same place. Indeed, the future he had already known was changing by his choice.\u201cActually, I was just here to tell you that I would choose Shin Division.\u201dAt Yuder\u2019s, Kishiar tilted his head as if to grasp what he meant.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhy would you choose Shin Division?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been training and thinking that I want to go further towards Shin rather than Sul.\u201d\u201cHmm. Even though your talent can blossom much faster and bigger if you move toward Sul Division?\u201dIt was like reading the future. However, Yuder did not panic this time and answered calmly as he had prepared.\u201cWill there be many consequences?\u201d\u201cThere you go.\u201dA smile came to Kishiar\u2019s red eyes.\u201cUsually, if you catch someone off guard like this, you\u2019ve thought it through and come to a conclusion, and they will stop and think about it again. But it doesn\u2019t seem to change your opinion, so it doesn\u2019t matter. All right, take care of Shin Division.\u201dIt was such a simple answer that didn\u2019t feel realistic. Yuder somehow felt dejected.It was clear in his memory that Kishiar had made him a deputy commander responsible for Sul Division and the whole thing almost at the same time for no particular reason. Because of that, he thought that if he went to Shin Division, he would doubt and refuse to accept it.But there was no sign of such a thing in Kishiar\u2019s attitude right now.\u201cOriginally, you have to write your own signatures on the paper, but that will be after something else.\u201dKishiar did not say what the other job was. But Yuder could tell what it was.\u2018Soon there will be time to receive a surname.\u2019In the past, he was given a surname name not long after joining the Cavalry. It was unprecedented to give a surname to hundreds of people in just a few months.Most of them were made without sincerity after the origin region or the names in the scriptures, but there was still an insurmountable gap in status between those with surnames and those without.Now that he thought about it, the emperor who authorized such work was also great. Obviously, the nobles\u2019 opposition must have been ridiculous, but how did he deal with it?In fact, there was not much he remembered about the former emperor, who passed away just before Yuder became the Cavalry commander and the current emperor as of now.At most, Yuder only knew that he was Kishiar La Orr\u2019s only brother. How many years had passed since he got sick before he died and did not even show up in front of his vessels? And the crown prince, who inherited the throne after his death, was an adopted son, not by blood.Yuder was stuck in the mountains and didn\u2019t even know the face of the lord ruling the village he lived in, let alone the emperor, but what could he remember?It was the first and last time that the emperor\u2019s face was seen during the opening ceremony.\u201cAnything else to say?\u201dWhile thinking about it, Kishiar asked, as if he thought Yuder had something else to say. Yuder looked at him and began to speak impulsively.\u201cWhy is Your Highness\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Commander.\u201dHe interrupted out of the blue. His relaxed red eyes were shining with mischief.\u201cAccording to Orr law, status does not take precedence over the position. Of course, there are a lot of people who ignore it, but as long as I\u2019m here, my title is just the commander.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. May I ask why you built this place, Commander-nim?\u201d\u201cBy this place, you mean this building? Or the Cavalry?\u201dHe clearly knew what Yuder was asking, but he hated the side of the snake. Yuder opened his mouth feeling anew.\u201cOf course the latter.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the first time anyone ever asked me that, so I checked just in case. The emperor didn\u2019t even ask why.\u201dThere was no sign in his expression that seemed reckless or arrogant.\u201cThe reason I made the Cavalry. It\u2019s simple. Power has to go in the right direction. If you try to stop or get rid of it, you\u2019ll always get the price of bad harmony. As a person with an ability just like you, I thought I\u2019d make a way for this power to flow toward the empire\u2019s safety. And I thought I was the best candidate because I was the only Awakener in the imperial family. That\u2019s all.\u201dIt was a standard answer that was hard to argue against.Yuder hesitated for a moment and decided to ask one more question.\u201cThen in the future, leading this Cavalry\u2026 Is it just you, Commander-nim?\u201d\u201cWhy would you ask that? Do you want this seat?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201dIf anyone else heard that, they wouldn\u2019t say anything, they would jump and blow the cocky commoner\u2019s head off immediately.Kishiar laughed louder than before as Yuder answered with a frown. It was a very pleasant-looking smile.\u201cWell, not now. But once the division is decided, I\u2019m going to hire a deputy commander to assist with my work. If you\u2019re as good as you are, you could be in that position.\u201d\u201cI would be ineligible.\u201dYuder answered immediately without a second thought.\u201cI\u2019m not very sociable and I\u2019m not very close to my fellow members.\u201d\u201cMy goodness. I thought you were quite high, but you were softer than I thought.\u201dKishiar shook his head.\u201cSocial friendship is definitely a good thing, but if that\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m going to pick, I could just bring a non-awakener. Keep in mind that your abilities are not from birth. Right now, you\u2019re used to your old life and intimidated by status, but in a few more years, it will probably be the opposite.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cEven if you didn\u2019t understand what I meant\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, I understand.\u201dThe reason why Yuder couldn\u2019t open his mouth immediately was that Kishiar\u2019s answers, which were spoken lightly, were all as accurate as if they had penetrated the future.That was what he said. As he mentioned, the Cavalry might be intimidated by the high-status Imperial Knights or nobles right now, but things would change over the years.The only thing that could solve the growing catastrophe was the Cavalry, and they would break away from the previous system and gain extraordinary status, promotions, and strength.When traditional strong men such as the Imperial Knights and the Pearl Tower mages could no longer treat the Cavalry and Awakeners recklessly, only those who had stronger power than the Awakeners could defeat them.For example, the commander, Yuder.Yuder had unconditionally played one-on-one sparring when a member who did not listen well appeared. And he beat them mercilessly in front of everyone, making them never do anything rebellious in front of his eyes again.There were many complaints that he seemed to be dealing with animals, not humans, but it was the most comfortable way to solve the problem. That was why there was nothing they could do.But now that hadn\u2019t happened in the past. Yuder thought Kishiar would have the vision to deal with the members in a different way than he did. But this was\u2026 maybe\u2026\u201cIf you don\u2019t have any more questions, get up.\u201d\u201cAh, yes sir.\u201d\u201cThis room is always open, so if you have any more questions, feel free to come. If I\u2019m not here, tell my aide.\u201dListening to Kishiar, Yuder began to think of it\u2026He\u2019d entered this room a few times before when Kishiar was the leader, but there was only one difference today. It was the presence of an aide.Nathan Zuckerman, was an aide famous for standing by Kishiar La Orr since he was a prince, not the Duke of Peletta. Was he here before to decide on a course?Kishiar turned his head, \u201cAh,\u201d as if he had guessed something while searching for a blurry memory.\u201cCome to think of it, you don\u2019t know who my aide is. Now he\u2019s working for me in Peletta Castle. He will be here soon after he finishes. He\u2019s not an Awakener, but he\u2019s quite a swordsman.\u201d\u2018Quite\u2019 he said. Yuder put up with a laugh for a moment.Nathan Zuckerman was a Swordmaster. It was not officially recognized, but it was clear that Yuder had heard it himself in the past. He thought of Kishiar, who casually says,\u00a0\u201cHe uses a sword quite a bit,\u201d\u00a0was also like a snake.\u201cI understand.\u201dAfter answering that question, Yuder left Kishiar\u2019s quarters. As he finally escaped from the holy sword\u2019s energy which had been sharpening his nerves because he felt it softly behind his back, he let out a long sigh.\u201cPhew.\u201dFirst of all, one thing was certain.Kishiar did not intend to hand over the Cavalry to anyone from the start.He was incredibly well aware of the Awakeners\u2019 propensity and future impact even though they had only been around for two years.If that snake-like man had stayed in the Cavalry, he wouldn\u2019t have failed as horribly as Yuder in the past. Because he had a noble lineage and connections from birth.Why did such a person suddenly give up his position as the Cavalry commander and go back to his hometown?It was his homework to look into from now on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFinally, all the Cavalry members had decided on their division.Commander Kishiar la Orr said he would allow a month\u2019s vacation period to live and make sure everyone is settled in.He also said that he would expand the treatment of Cavalry members to the level of the Imperial Knights, and everyone was surprised when he announced that soon they would be bestowing a surname for those without one.The Cavalry members were now under the command of the Imperial Palace and could receive a large salary equivalent to third-degree management. They were eligible to live anywhere in the Orr Empire and could use facilities directly operated by the state without paying.If they were accused of sin, they would be punished after being judged by the commander and emperor, not by the local lord, which was tantamount to the absolute immunity of the Imperial Knights.As a result, accommodation had changed, allowing people with homes in the capital to commute from home, not from their dormitory.Members who chose to stay in their dormitories received one room each. There was a limitation that it was possible to live in accommodation for up to five years except for the commander, but that was enough for those who still didn\u2019t have enough property to buy a house in the capital.\u201cHow awesome. It\u2019s a big deal like the real Imperial Knights. Of course, when they are assigned accommodation, they also receive one servant, but we don\u2019t need that much.\u201d\u201cYes, we can put on our own clothes.\u201dAfter the shocking morning presentation, a burst of laughter broke out among the Cavalry members gathered for a meal.Everyone\u2019s faces were bright. In the faces lit with hope, Yuder silently dipped his bread in the stew and chewed.\u201cYuder, did you hear that? They say we will get 30 days of vacation just like the Imperial Knights. If our children later are Awakeners, we can pass on this treatment.\u201dGakane talked to him with a smile.\u201cIf you tell this to your family, everyone will love it. The years of being ignored as a family with no land to inherit will be over.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Right.\u201d\u201cOh, come to think of it, shouldn\u2019t you tell your family about it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alone.\u201dWhen Gakane opened his eyes wide at Yuder\u2019s words, he soon looked sorry like a drooping dog.\u201cI see. Sorry. I thought you had a family back home because of what Kanna said when she read your bracelet before.\u201d\u2018My bracelet? \u2026 Ah.\u2019Yuder recalled the day he went to take the Cavalry test. To test whether Kanna\u2019s ability, whom he met for the first time that day, was real, he handed over a bracelet in his pocket to read it.The bracelet, made by cutting small gemstones and threading them, was the only relic of his grandfather that Yuder had. The only gift he\u2019d ever made for his young grandson, who will be left alone just before he died.Although he kept it in his bag in case it broke off because it was too old now, he just came up to the capital and couldn\u2019t organize all his luggage, so he carried it in his pocket instead.After becoming the commander, he didn\u2019t even care about it properly, so when he regressed, he felt quite unfamiliar when he saw it in his pocket.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dIn a brief response to Gakane, Yuder recalled his lodge in his hometown mountains. He didn\u2019t organize his house properly in case he didn\u2019t pass the Cavalry test, so he thought he should visit and take care of it at least once when he took a vacation.\u201cRight, Yuder! If you take a vacation, why don\u2019t you come over to my house? I told my parents and younger siblings about you in a letter, and they were all very curious. There are many great foods and fun things to play in the South. I\u2019ll treat you right, so give me a visit.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell, Gakane. What about us?\u201dSome of the other members who were eating by their side asked in voiceless tones.\u201cAren\u2019t we friends?\u201d\u201cOf course. I want to take Yuder first, so you guys next time. Shouldn\u2019t you go home first?\u201d\u2018I didn\u2019t tell him I would come, but he\u2019s already on about the vacation.\u2019Gakane\u2019s outspoken attitude was a bit astounding, but Yuder said nothing. The rose-brimmed handsome red-haired man would not always fall from Yuder\u2019s side.Yuder didn\u2019t know what he liked so much, but even after falling into his private accommodation, he came to play every day and Yuder kicked him out several times.The other members\u2019 attitudes who had difficulty in knowing how to treat Yuder had also changed a lot.The mere presence of Kanna and Gakane alone surprised Yuder that he could be accepted to this extent among the members.\u201cYou\u2019re going to receive a surname, too. I envy you for receiving a surname from the Emperor. I\u2019d love to get it, too.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019d better not say that anywhere else.\u201dGakane shook his hand while saying\u00a0\u2018Ack!\u2019\u00a0as Yuder frowned and murmured.\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m jealous of the commoners or anything. It\u2019s just a great opportunity. There were few people in the Empire\u2019s history who received the first and last names given by the Emperor. I\u2019m jealous of the opportunity to be recorded there.\u201dThe names and surnames given by the emperor were very special gifts that only went to those who made great contributions. But it didn\u2019t mean much to Yuder, who had an enormous record of receiving both.\u201cIt won\u2019t do much good.\u201d\u201cSometimes you talk like you know everything. If you get a surname, your status itself changes. Of course, it\u2019s good to be free from the tax and labor obligations of commoners.\u201dHe was right, but there was nothing in the world that was unconditionally good. People with genders were given new duties and responsibilities of their own.Cavalry members who would receive much for having abilities would now have to fight another war.\u2018And there is not a bit of sincerity to be given.\u2019Yuder rose from his seat after eating, ignoring Gakane, who was poised to recite a hundred good things that would happen if he received a surname.\u201cI\u2019m going first.\u201d\u201cYuder, I\u2019ll come with you.\u201dGakane woke up with a stew that he couldn\u2019t finish.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you eat up and come back.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to the sword training ground anyway. I just feel like throwing up even if I eat a lot.\u201dGakane shook his head and pretended to throw up lightly.The Sul division which focused on those using magic-like power spent most of their training strengthening their abilities and giving them more accurate and stronger power.Therefore, there was little need to gather and train individually, but there were many people who had similar abilities in the Shin division.Since most of them were able to strengthen their body or use weapons well, they had to learn how to use various weapons properly and how to protect others and work together.Among those skills, it was the swordsmanship that Kishiar la Orr asked the Shin Division members to learn the hardest. Yuder thought he could guess his intentions.Swordsmen had traditionally been treated better than other weapons. Swordmasters that had made their mark in history appeared relatively often, but they did not exist like Bowmasters and Lancemasters.Swords had traditionally been the martial arts of the nobility. The most common weapon available was a sword.As it was easy to access, there are many holders and countless admirers, so the probability of Swordmasters coming out in proportion had also increased.Swordmasters reminded them of the noble image of a general or a commander in charge of each country\u2019s military power. The biggest feature of a Swordmaster was that they were able to freely use the aura that energized the sword.And there were a lot of Cavalry members in Shin Division who could do it without any effort. Although the usage and inspection proficiency were lower than those of real Swordmasters, the strength or output of their energy was no less than that of a master.Kishiar la Orr intended to gain strength from the ranks of Cavalry members through that very thing.\u201cBut what made him designate the new training ground as the Imperial Knight\u2019s first training ground? I heard it\u2019s only used by people above deputy level?\u201dAs they entered the site used by the Imperial Knights, the surrounding energy became sharp.It meant that those who saw the Cavalry members coming in felt bad.Over the past few months, Cavalry members had been trained at boot camp in the corner of the site. Even back then, the Imperial Knights showed signs of discomfort.However, now that they had notified them that they would use the first training ground, which was the same as their pride, he wondered how they pushed ahead.\u2018I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s been able to give an order with the emperor\u2019s seal on it.\u2019Yuder deliberately did not go all out for months of basic training. Even without all his might, his ability was beyond the normal level of the unit.Instead, he became accustomed to the energy flowing around his body based on his past memories and practiced bringing them into his body momentarily.Mages and knights who used traditional mana accumulated the energy flowing in nature for a long time and were only able to use it as much as he did, but those who awakened the new mana were different.They were able to use the strange energy that filled the world through the power of red stones freely through tricks and practice without having to build up their bodies.It meant that it was more important to attract and use more energy in a more instant of time, and how familiar one was with the use and application of their abilities.However, it also required adaptation and practice, so it was good to get used to energy through meditation for a few hours every day. It was only about three years from now that this turned out to be true, but there was no harm in doing it in advance.Gakane seemed to have mistaken Yuder, who meditated every morning, for actually being a faithful believer of the Sun God, but Yuder was too lazy to correct it, so he let him misunderstand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe first training ground of the Imperial Knights was built magnificently in the center of the huge site.Right next to the training ground was Orr\u2019s Glory Hall, a key organization of the Knights, built in a structure to watch the place. Administration and duties within most of the knights, important events, various tasks being carried out, and knights above the deputy level gathering all often happened here.In other words, it was at the heart of the armed forces that protected the capital and moved the entire empire.In a place like that, people who used to be \u2018bigots\u2019 a few months ago crawled in and stepped on it. It was an insult to the Imperial Knights.\u201cLook, there\u2019s a couple more punks coming.\u201dA sharp voice was hurdled toward Gakane and Yuder, who had just entered the training ground.Several knights didn\u2019t hide their anger-filled eyes. They were gathered and acted sarcastically toward the Cavalry members.\u201cLook at those muscle-less arms. How about those hands that don\u2019t show any calluses? What the hell can we do with them? Do they even know how to\u00a0read?\u201d\u201cWhat a ridiculous insult to the thousand-year history of the Imperial Knights. What the hell was His Majesty and the Commander thinking?\u201c\u2026\u201dYuder glanced at them and ignored them. Gakane\u2019s face turned a little red but he didn\u2019t show much.\u201cWelcome, Gakane, Yuder.\u201dThey met the Shin division members already arriving in the middle of the training ground. They, who were listening to the knights\u2019 sarcastic comments first, also looked unhappy.Among them, a woman with long hair tied up came forward and greeted Gakane first.\u201cEver, you\u2019re here first.\u201d\u2018Her name will be Ever Beck when she receives her surname.\u2019Yuder had known her for a long time. She was one of the first people in the rumors spread in the empire after the Red Stone fell two years ago, drawing more attention because she was a country girl who had never been ordinary before.A slender woman who killed a flock of monsters from the mountains with just one finger. There was no more disturbing news in the world.Her rumors spread all over the world like hotcakes by witnesses. A few of the members who learned her identity after being admitted to the Cavalry knew the story.Her ability was muscular strength and skin strength. She was strong enough to tear alive many monsters without using any weapons, so she performed several duties in the Cavalry even before Yuder died.She looked normal on the outside and should not be ignored. Few people knew how to use that power as effectively as her, even if they had a stronger or more defensive power than her.According to old memories, Ever was also in charge as the deputy commander of the Shin division.\u201cIt\u2019s been very noisy since the first training session after the division sorting. Well, we can\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve been doing that all along?\u201d\u201cYeah, they\u2019re never tired, they\u2019ve been doing that.\u00a0I\u00a0could hardly believe they\u2019ve been doing that since dawn. Well, busy nobles wouldn\u2019t possibly do that.\u201dWhen Ever talked with a cold face, a small smile spread between the Shin division members.\u201cI tried not to let them in at all.\u201dThe little boy standing next to Ever waved and grumbled with a brighter face. He was one of the earliest awakeners and as famous as Ever. Jimmy Ocker, an ordinary commoner boy, cut a rock with a branch at the age of just ten years old.\u2018Of course, before he receives a surname, his name is just Jimmy.\u2019Two years after the fall of the red stone, Jimmy, who was now 12 years old, left his parents and passed the Cavalry exam.His parents were told that even commoners could generously support their son because they owned a store that managed to run soundly.He was the youngest successful candidate among the 330 Cavalry members, but he knew better than anyone else how to perform similarly to the legendary Swordmaster. He used a weapon with an aura of a Swordmaster was enough to dampen the enemy\u2019s chills.\u201cI don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t because all the children who enter the Imperial Knights\u2019 Order start at the age of 10, and I\u2019m 12.\u201dAs Jimmy said, most prestigious knights began their career as knights around the age of 10.They didn\u2019t have to suffer because they became a servant of a knight who had a relationship with their parents, and most of them used to live by learning experiences over their shoulders and taking occasional sword tutoring.Then, when they got older, they officially joined the Knights and were commissioned. It was no exaggeration to say that the lowly commoners couldn\u2019t intervene in their own world.\u201cShow them your strength when you train later. You can do that.\u201dThe Shin division members nodded as Gakane stroked Jimmy\u2019s head and gave him advice. There were more members from commoners in the Shin division than in Sul.They were terrified and intimidated by the Imperial Knights\u2019 presence, but were trying to overcome it.\u2018Yeah, it\u2019s still tough now.\u2019It would work out in a few years, but not yet. It took time and experience to get out of that deep-rooted sense of identity and gain confidence. Kishiar la Orr was going to make it happen.Yuder looked at their faces and nodded. It was at that moment.\u201cI wondered what was so loud. The vermin have gathered.\u201dA young knight with a frown on his face appeared with several subordinates. Unlike other knights, he wore three more lilies on top of a gold eagle engraved on his chest.\u201cWhat do the lillies mean?\u201dWhen Jimmy asked with a puzzled look, Gakane opened his mouth without taking his eyes off the knight.\u201cThe golden eagle is a symbol of the Imperial Knights. And the lily is a symbol of nobility. Five lilies in a uniform mean the Knights commander, four is deputy commander, and three is just below it.\u201d\u201cThen he is someone of a very high position.\u201d\u201cYeah. Well, most of them didn\u2019t have any lilies until retirement.\u201dGakane once said he had learned the sword as a child, aiming to join a famous knighthood. However, he gave up because he could not afford the money needed to become a knight because he had a family name but had no power.The reason why there were no commoners in the Knights with known names was that the shiny uniforms, armor, swords, and horses were not all paid for by the superiors.They spent quite a lot of money trying to maintain dignity. It was also added to the Imperial Knights, who were all aristocrats.The blue uniforms the knights wore were made of high-quality cloth, and their swords were famous, like family swords.Except for wearing a black uniform that had just been paid for, it was completely different from the Cavalry, which had few individual swords.\u201cWho said you guys were allowed in here?\u201dA knight with three lilies approached the Cavalry members. No matter how confident they were in their skills, few people had been able to stand tall in front of such an arrogant high-ranking noble so far, causing embarrassment among the members.Yuder sighed softly as he watched even the imposing Gakane show signs of momentary distress on his face.\u201cWe are here to train under the commander\u2019s instruction.\u201d\u201cCommander, you said. Are you talking about the Duke of Peletta?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dHe was asking even though he already knew. Yuder could tell by his arrogant expression.\u201cI\u2019ve known him since I was a kid. He was a frequent traveler, but I didn\u2019t expect him to do this. It\u2019s the best whim he\u2019s ever had, having a bunch of guys like you as the boss there. His knights in Peletta must be crying.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHis friendship with Kishiar was just sarcastic, and anger spread all over the Cavalry members\u2019 faces. When someone clenched their fists and heard a thud, the knights behind the three lilies also put their hands on the sword hilts with frowns against him. He was threatening to take out a weapon at any moment.And in that atmosphere, only Yuder maintained a calm, expressionless look.\u201cExcuse me, who are you to say so?\u201dYuder genuinely did not know who he was. In the past, he was in the Sul division, so there was not much chance for him to see people of the Imperial Knights.He thought he knew quite a bit about the faces of nobles he met since he became the commander, but he only had a few reasons to know the man in front of him now.One, he died before Yuder became commander. Two, he retired and moved into the lands.Either way, it was not an honorable reason for that young knight in his prime. Even more so, if he was a member of a family prestigious enough to talk about the imperial family, he would be able to live in the capital.Perhaps the man in front of Yuder was the one who disappeared from here two years later. There was nothing to worry about as long as he knew it.\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s alive in the future.\u2019\u201cWho am\u00a0I?\u201dThe knight with the three lilies looked around and laughed. His sleek face bright enough to seem like gold was of a handsome man who deserved to be considered noble anywhere. But he was just a child in Yuder\u2019s eyes.\u201cKiolle da Diarca. Have you ever heard of the Duke of Diarca, commoner?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere were a total of five dukes in the empire. Most of them were from the founding of the empire, as well as the children of the first emperor.This was because after Ivanar la Orr, the eldest son of the first emperor, was crowned, the other four brothers were assigned and became dukes.Kishiar, the Duke of Peletta, was a rare case. There were only a few cases of a person inheriting the duke\u2019s title within the empire who had the surname of \u201cLa Orr\u201d.There was only one reason why it was possible. Because his father, the former emperor, personally conferred him a new duke when he was alive.Under the imperial law, the prince would be deprived of his right to inherit and would never be able to seek the throne again. It was a precedent that had been followed since the first emperor and a good system to use to prevent blood-spattered power struggles between children.However, the duke\u2019s title was not granted proper land because it was close to a temporary job. Most of them had no power and had to defend their celibacy until they died for some reason, or were knighted in that way, and lived quietly in a corner of the estate and died.The nobles thought that Kisiar la Orr had a very big problem. Rumor had it that he was seemingly fine but seedless and had low intelligence.Kishiar did not deny the rumor and played with many.His love affair history had been famous since his days as a prince, but the rumor was treated almost as true because no one showed up saying that they had his child.It was also said that the emperor was generous with his younger brother Kishiar without killing him. And he was only letting Kishiar go because he didn\u2019t cause any big accident with his only younger brother.So when he first appeared properly and established the Cavalry and became the commander of it, some thought that the play-loving duke wanted to persuade the emperor to play a commander for a while after Awakening his power. It was a misunderstanding that would soon be broken.On the surface, it would seem to be the first meaningful Awakener group on the continent founded by a duke from the imperial family. But it was not just beautiful from the inside.Anyway, the fact that Kishiar, who had the last name \u2018La Orr\u2019, took charge of the armed group, could give him the image of trying to challenge the emperor\u2019s power. But it was done without much noise because there was a power structure underneath it that no one else could see.Yuder didn\u2019t know this until after he became the commander. There might be other circumstances that he hadn\u2019t known, but it was not known at the time of Kishiar\u2019s and the former emperor\u2019s death.So even more, Yuder wondered what the real reason for Kishiar\u2019s creation of this group was. Because he knew that Kishiar wasn\u2019t as stupid as people said, nor was his sexual function crippled.Was the good justification that Kishiar la Orr said indeed true? Was that really all?\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re so surprised to hear my name that you can\u2019t even speak?\u201dWhile continuing to think, Yuder came to his senses at the sound of Kiolle da Diarca snorting.The Duke of Diarca had a blood relationship with the next crown prince. Therefore, he understood that this young knight, a member of that household, was complaining and citing Kishiar\u2019s name.The question, however, was why this person with such a background disappeared without a trace in the past.Considering that he joined the Knight brigade, he was certainly not the duke\u2019s successor. None of the four duke families had an infliction to martial arts, so they preferred to make their remaining children ministers or priests rather than sending them as knights.Nevertheless, anyone of them who became a knight would have been a nobody there.The energy flowing through his body didn\u2019t seem to be that great either, so it was more likely that he\u2019d risen to that position thanks to his family\u2019s name than to his ability.\u2018Did he live like that, infuriated someone, and was assassinated?\u2019Under his expressionless face, Yuder began to speak with a nonchalant thought.\u201cThe Duke of Diarca. Of course, I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d\u201cI guess so. Now just get out of here. This is no place for people like you to step in.\u201d\u201cI cannot do that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dKiolle\u2019s cold face was distorted.\u201cHow dare you ignore my orders?\u201d\u201cShall we get him out now?\u201dOne of his servants asked, unable to resist an unpleasant look.\u201cIt\u2019s our commander who asked us to come here for training. Do you think you would\u2019ve done this without discussing it with the commander of the Imperial Knights?\u201dIn other words, he meant \u2018why are you telling us what to do when the commander of the Imperial Knights already gave us permission?\u2019.As if he understood what Yuder meant, Kiolle\u2019s eyes turned red with anger. Yuder thought he would try to get his men to drive them away, but he was more thoughtless than Yuder thought.The young knight immediately drew a sword from his waist and pointed it at Yuder\u2019s neck.\u201cCome. I will let you know your position today. Because you are one of the punks who are proud to\u00a0believe\u00a0that you have power.\u201d (Kiolle)\u201cYuder!\u201dGakane jumped out from the back and tried to block Yuder\u2019s front.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the Imperial Knights don\u2019t draw swords meaninglessly. It wouldn\u2019t be good for the knight to grow up like this.\u201d\u201cThis bastard and that bastard, both of you don\u2019t know your position.\u201dThe sword Kiolle aimed at did not shake. Yuder grabbed Gakane\u2019s shoulder as he tried to go further forward to defend him.\u201cGakane. Back off.\u201d\u201cYuder? Don\u2019t tell me, you are\u2026\u201d\u201cLegally, the Cavalry members are not much different from the Imperial Knights. Even if we have a duel, it is fine as long as we have mutual consent.\u201dOriginally, there was no duel between commoners and nobles. But this situation was extraordinary.When Yuder pointed it out quietly, the Cavalry members, who were at a loss behind their backs, opened their mouths in unison. The same was true of Gakane\u2019s expression.\u201cIt can\u2019t be all right, Yuder. No matter how\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dYuder said with confidence. Gakane\u2019s green eyes momentarily drained after hearing his powerful voice. Yuder turned to his side and tilted his head.\u201cIt\u2019s great to be on the training ground. If you apply for a duel, I will accept it. But I don\u2019t have a weapon, so the knight needs to provide me with a sword.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ha!\u201dThere was a spark in Kiolle\u2019s eyes.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such an insolent man in my life. Congratulations on making me wonder about the name of a mere commoner. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\u2018Did he just hear that?\u2019\u00a0Yuder opened his mouth, feeling a subtle pity for his intelligence.\u201cI\u2019m Yuder.\u201d\u201cAll right. You there, offer him your sword.\u201d\u201cHuh? But my sword is a family sword handed down by my father\u2026\u201dAs Kiolle nodded and said to one of the servants behind his back, the servant shook his head with a tearful look. It was so funny that the Cavalry members forgot it was a serious situation and burst into laughter.\u201cPfft! He\u2019s not even a five-year-old, what the hell is that? I wouldn\u2019t want kids to play like that in my town.\u201d\u201cGive me yours! I don\u2019t want to! Huaa!\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s talking nonsense?\u201dThe Cavalry members were quiet again due to Kiolle\u2019s cold roar. But once the mood changed, it couldn\u2019t change again just because he was shouting.Even the Imperial Knights\u2019 faces surrounding the area with the intention of watching the Cavalry members spread an unbearable smile. They used to think that Kiolle trusted in his family\u2019s power.Recognizing it, Kiolle\u2019s face turned redder. He turned back and slapped the servant in the face.\u201cYou dare defame the master you serve. You\u2019re fired. Go back and pack up right away.\u201d\u201cPardon? N-no. I\u2019ll give you my sword, Kiolle-nim!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it. Don\u2019t you hear me say get out? Or I\u2019ll kill you here first.\u201dAs Kiolle\u2019s sword headed toward his neck, the servant screamed and fell down.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dMost of the Kiolle\u2019s servants looked to be in their mid-teens. Even though he knew how to use the sword to some extent, he was still young.Swinging a sword without hesitation against such a child. Thinking of such a character, Yuder added confidence to speculation that Kiolle probably had been assassinated in the past by someone for a grudge.\u2018What an irascible kid.\u2019Yuder raised his hand and swung slightly. Then Kiolle\u2019s sword stopped momentarily as if it had been caught in an invisible hand and swung toward Yuder.\u201cUgh! W, what!\u201d\u201cKiolle-nim!\u201dKiolle, fortunately, did not miss the sword handle. However, as if he was pulled by a sword moving freely, he couldn\u2019t get ahold of his body and fell forward.\u201c\u2026\u201dDust flopped over the nice training ground, where the soil was evenly spread like white powder.Everyone was in shock. Kiolle himself, his subordinates, and the others surrounding him were shocked and couldn\u2019t say anything. The only one not surprised here was Yuder himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Without even thinking about putting up his disheveled bangs, Yuder kindly told Kiolle who looked up at him.\u201cEverything pure in nature follows me. The knight\u2019s sword, made by smelting iron from nature with fire, means that it follows me more than you.\u201dAs he moved his hand once again, Kiolle\u2019s sword swung into the air and went down. Kiolle opened his eyes like a man seeing a ghost on his sword.\u201c\u2026 Impossible.\u201d\u201cYou can do more impossible things.\u201dYuder\u2019s finger flicked once more. Then a flame blew over the sword held by Kiolle.\u201cKiolle-nim!\u201dKiolle was unable to overcome the soaring heat of the flame and abandoned the sword. A beautiful flame burned on the sword\u2019s blade that fell on the floor and soon disappeared. But it wasn\u2019t really burned or scorched, leaving no trace on the blade and handle.In front of everyone, a disbelief sigh leaked out of Kiolle\u2019s open lips, who threw the sword that resembled the knight\u2019s life and even covered it with dirt.Yuder sighed quietly as that person glared at him with his bloody eyes.\u2018If he runs for it, it might be a bit of a headache. I was just trying to play with him.\u2019\u201cYou, why didn\u2019t you go to the Sul division?\u201dOne of the Cavalry members gathered behind asked mysteriously. When Yuder turned his head to answer it, someone else\u2019s answer came before him.\u201cIf you can do both, you don\u2019t have to limit your options.\u201d\u201cCommander-nim!\u201dBefore he knew it, Kishiar stood behind the cavalry. The knights, who didn\u2019t notice that he had come here because of the unprecedented surprise, looked alternately at the entrance and Kishiar with surprised faces.It was a shame of the Imperial Knights that they had no idea that the duke with such a noticeable appearance and a higher position than others walked in proudly.Training to feel sensitive was one of the things that all knights sharpened and polished from an early age.\u201cI was talking to Theo a little late, and you were doing pretty funny things.\u201dKishiar walked slowly in front of the Cavalry. His red eyes fell off the floor, at the sword fluttering away, and then at Yuder\u2019s face.Yuder felt a little uneasy when he saw the smile on that man\u2019s face looking at him.\u201cYuder.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCommander-nim, Yuder only stepped up for us!\u201dEver shouted from behind when Kishiar called out Yuder\u2019s name. Only then did the other members swallowing their breaths raised their voices one by one and sympathized with her.\u201cThat\u2019s right. They told us to ignore us first and leave.\u201d\u201cWe told them that we had to train, but they wouldn\u2019t listen!\u201d\u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t call Yuder to scold him. It\u2019s not bad to see that there\u2019s already a sense of camaraderie between you, but don\u2019t misunderstand.\u201dEver\u2019s ears turned red when Kishiar smirked and spoke.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cI forgive you generously. Alright, then. Yuder. Why don\u2019t you tell me why you didn\u2019t wait for me to come? I\u2019ve already lost my motivation and I can\u2019t handle it.\u201dAfter joking and winking in an exaggerated way, Kishiar asked Yuder a question. The question never came with the intention of scolding or berating him. He was rather saying the opposite.The shock spread like a tremor among the knights. Kiolle was also looking at Kishiar like a man hit in the head.\u201cNow, as my unit says. Why do the other knights add up to the decision that I made after talking to Theo myself? Theo generously understood all the circumstances. If you have any complaints, tell your commander directly.\u201dKishiar casually called the Imperial Knights Commander Theorado van Tyne by the nickname \u201cTheo\u201d.However, the knights could not believe that the esteemed commander of the Imperial Knights had given permission to use an important training ground.\u201cWhy on earth would the commander give them such permission? This place is designed for the knights. Why do we have to cut down on our training time because of them? What kind of place is this\u2026?\u201dWhen one of the knights shouted unbearably, Kishiar burst into laughter.\u201cReally? Then you can train here. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re short of land. You can use whatever you want.\u201dHis low voice caught everyone\u2019s attention incredibly.Kishiar smiled as he looked directly at the knight who shouted at him.\u201cThere is no compensation for all the natural disasters that may happen during training. It happens during formal training hours. Whether the sword burns, the ground turns upside down, or the tree breaks\u2026 Any member of the brave Imperial Knights can handle it. Right?\u201c\u2026\u201dThe knight\u2019s face hardened with insult and fear.\u201cWe\u2019re about to start training. All those who are confident may stay here. If not, go back.\u201dAfter the silence, the Imperial Knights stepped down. Yuder saw Kiolle staring at him and rose on his own feet, shaking off the support from his servant.\u201cI\u2019ll remember you, you bastard.\u201dBut as soon as Kiolle picked up the sword and disappeared, Yuder soon forgot about him.\u2018Why would I remember someone who would soon disappear?\u2019\u201cYuder, are you all right?\u201dWhen the knights disappeared, the Cavalry members standing back rushed to Yuder in unison. They mentioned Yuder\u2019s work first thing first, swearing at the knights, and strengthening their camaraderie higher than ever before.\u201cYuder\u2026 that was great. I\u2019m sorry I should\u2019ve stepped up.\u201dYuder patted Gakane on the back with his mouth shut like a big dog.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cBut still\u2026 I don\u2019t deserve to be your friend. I\u2019m so ashamed.\u201d\u201cI told you it\u2019s okay.\u201dHe wouldn\u2019t have been much help to come forward anyway. But he thought it was amazing that Gakane gave him a chance. It was the first time someone had stepped up for Yuder.\u201cI always thought it was unfortunate because I didn\u2019t talk, but I saw it again.\u201dWhen Gakane stepped down, the other member behind him held out their thumbs and laughed.\u201cI think I\u2019ll have to change the training a little bit today. Learning the sword is important, but it\u2019s more important to figure out how much strength you have. This is the only training ground here with a protective magic circle on the ground, so you don\u2019t have to hold back. The protection magic circle engraved with the mana of the archmage Est is still functioning. I want all of you to participate with confidence.\u201dOnly then did Yuder understand why Kishiar had to use this place as the training site.They followed Kishiar\u2019s instructions to properly inform each other of their abilities and trained to control them by comparing the maximum and minimum output.Yuder succeeded without difficulty, but there were more clumsy members among them, who couldn\u2019t project the power in the direction that they intended.\u201cOur ability has never been before. That is, the more you know about yourself, the more it becomes your asset. Keep that in mind.\u201dDuring the training, Kishiar used a clear and determined tone instead of his usual languid smile.The whole ground shook with a bang as someone swung a huge transformed hand on the floor. Still, it was true that the protection magic circle was on, but the aftermath did not reach the buildings outside the training ground.\u201cYuder, when you\u2019re done with your training, come to my quarters this evening.\u201dBefore the training was over, Kishiar came close to Yuder after watching him proceed with the training and left instructions in a voice so small that no one else could hear. Yuder looked at him and nodded slightly.* * *\u2018What is he calling me for? Is it because of that knight kid?\u2019After washing up after all the training, Yuder climbed the stairs alone. No matter how hard he thought about it, that was all he could guess for a reason that Kishiar would secretly call him.\u2018It didn\u2019t happen in the past\u2026 I can\u2019t guess what\u2019s inside of his head.\u2019Yuder\u2019s reality had changed by choosing the new division. More things hadn\u2019t been done before, and his future information had often become obsolete. It was still like that.Standing in front of the top floor where Kishiar was staying, he grabbed the lion-shaped doorknob and tapped it twice. Soon the door opened and the person inside showed his face.\u201cWelcome. Are you the one who was supposed to visit this evening?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a strange face. He\u2019d seen it in the past. But it was their first time meeting now. Yuder nodded at the icy handsome man.\u201cThe Duke left for a moment. He\u2019ll be back soon, so please sit down.\u201dThere was a thin scar over this unique muscle that had long been held by the sword.The man, who had light reddish skin unique to Southerners, guided Yuder to the table with an emotionless expression and held out a teacup that seemed to have been boiled in advance.It was ironic that a beautiful ceramic teacup didn\u2019t fit in the big hand.\u201cHave a drink.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter finishing everything he had to do, the man silently stepped back to the bookshelf and stood up. He seemed to be just standing there, but it was a place where one could always see everything in this room at a glance.\u2018Is he the swordmaster?\u2019Yuder felt a slight push for him at heart.He was Nathan Zuckerman, the aide and hidden swordmaster who followed Kishiar la Orr. Yuder heard that his origin was somewhere in the southern country, not the empire, but he forgot.That man blindly followed only Kishiar. And after Kishiar\u2019s death, he disappeared like a man who had never existed never appearing again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayExternally, Nathan Zuckerman was not a swordmaster. In fact, Yuder was surprised that he was so talented that he could not be pushed back against Awakeners.Unlike the colorful knights he met during the day, he could feel the dense energy emitted from Nathan Zuckerman\u2019s body, steadily refined and piled up for a long time. The amount was comparable to the outstanding mages Yuder had faced in the past.For mages, the mana quantity built up was important, but for swordsmen, the quality was more important than the quantity of mana. Since it was much harder to load the sword with energy than to use magic, only the well-filtered pure mana could have the power to be loaded with the sword.To build such a thing as a swordsman meant that Nathan Zuckerman had great skills.\u2018I didn\u2019t know because I met him later\u2026 He is already great from the start.\u2019This was also possible because Yuder\u2019s sense of feeling others\u2019 energy was incomparably developed.The use of the ability was no different than it was 13 years ago, but its senses didn\u2019t fade even though he regressed because it was carved into the soul.Maybe because it was more of a trick that he\u2019d learned over a long period of time by meeting a lot of powerful people.\u201c\u2026\u201dYuder looked around the room without drinking the tea Nathan gave him. The appearance of the room hadn\u2019t changed much from before. The divine sword on the transparent scabbard above the fireplace remained the same.\u2018Still giving off those uncomfortable vibes.\u2019Yuder tried to ignore the elusive divine sword as if it were aiming for his body.\u201cMy goodness. You\u2019re here first. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHow many minutes had passed? Kishiar was back. Nathan, who opened the door, took his coat off his shoulders and the gloves to arrange them without a word. An imperial duke who didn\u2019t have a servant to attend to him, but everything was taken care of by his aide.It was strange, but Yuder knew he had done it in the past, so he didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cOh, it\u2019s clam tea. Is it the season already? Nathan\u2019s tea brewing skills are excellent, so you can drink without worry. Don\u2019t tell me he put something in it?\u201d\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\u201cHahaha. I\u2019m just kidding.\u201dAs Kishiar sat in front of Yuder, a fragrant scent came out at the tip of his nose. He thought it was a high-quality soap fragrant used in baths, but what he smelled afterward was the lingering scent of strong perfume. Yuder immediately stiffened his shoulders and turned his eyes toward him.The tip of Kishiar\u2019s golden hair was a little wet.\u201cYou must have taken a bath.\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh. That\u2019s right. You have a good eye.\u201dKishiar smiled as he swept through his hair. But Yuder did not smile back.\u2018It\u2019s a perfume popular among the ladies. I\u2019m sure of it.\u2019How could the scent of someone\u2019s perfume remain on his body and wouldn\u2019t be erased even after washing up? Who did Kishiar la Orr meet and what did he do? Yuder could guess roughly.\u2018He said they had a good time\u2026\u2019Although Kishiar\u2019s rumors weren\u2019t good, he\u2019d always been popular. Because he was the type of person with a confident physique and beautiful appearance like a God\u2019s child.He was famous for not rejecting the temptation that poured on him.Yuder thought Kishiar had lived quietly after becoming a commander in his past memories, but he guessed he didn\u2019t know everything.Well, it was none of Yuder\u2019s business. However, he only thought that such a sword-wielding fire play would help increase his order.\u201cI was wondering why you called me.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. I called you to talk about what happened today.\u201dKishiar sipped his tea.\u201cThis time, fortunately, I arrived properly and it ended well. But my arrival could have not happened. Or maybe I wouldn\u2019t have stood up for you. Why did you do such a reckless thing? I thought you were far from a reckless type.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cKiolle da Diarca is unnecessarily persistent and can be annoying. But he\u2019s a man of a very noble family.\u201dWho was Kiolle da Diarca? Only a few seconds later did Yuder recall that it was the name of the knight he ran into during the day.He\u2019d decided to remember what he did with the young knight and forget the rest. It really went past his head. It meant that his brain didn\u2019t feel the need to remember.\u201cI acted as such because I thought that would never happen, so it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cThat would never happen?\u201dKishiar asked back with an interested face.\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cMy side is much stronger. Besides me, there were many other members who could win even if those knights gathered all behind their backs. That\u2019s as far as we can go with whatever happens.\u201d\u201cYou mean, you didn\u2019t wait for me to arrive, you just believed that your side was much stronger?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201dKishiar burst into laughter.\u201cSo how do you intend to resolve your problem with Kiolle da Diarca? His family is already putting pressure on us and they want to punish you.\u201d\u201cAm I in trouble?\u201dInstead of answering, Yuder threw a counter-question.\u201cIf I am in trouble, you can kick me out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKishiar\u2019s smile grew a little thicker. He leaned his face against his hand on the chair\u2019s armrest. Red eyes shone through the golden hair.\u201cYou passed the Cavalry test, but you have no attachment feelings.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFor Yuder, it would be better if the future didn\u2019t flow the same way as before. Being kicked out of here didn\u2019t mean the other way disappeared.On the contrary, if he left, the chances of Kishiar remaining as the commander of the Cavalry may be greater. It wasn\u2019t a bad result if he thought about it.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen someone who doesn\u2019t hesitate. Were you always this fearless?\u201d\u201c\u2026I guess so.\u201dLooking back on his memory, Yuder had received similar reviews from Kishiar in the past.[\u2026 Yudrain, you\u2019re too fearless that it becomes a problem. But that\u2019s what makes me\u2026]\u2018No.\u2019By closing his eyes, Yuder let go of a useless memory of the past. No, that future wouldn\u2019t come. He didn\u2019t have to think about it because he wouldn\u2019t make it happen.\u201cWhy do you look so stiff all of a sudden? As if I just asked something I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. It doesn\u2019t matter if they have a grudge against me. I will take care of it on my own so that it doesn\u2019t damage the Calvary.\u201d\u201cHaha. Nathan, did you hear what he said? He\u2019ll figure it out on his own.\u201dKishiar burst into laughter again.\u201cThat\u2019s what a commoner orphan says as if he could defeat a great duke family who has been around for a thousand years. It\u2019s really interesting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNathan\u2019s icy blue eyes glanced at Yuder\u2019s face. After a while, he turned ahead.\u201cI wonder why you think your power is so great. From what I\u2019ve seen so far, it\u2019s amazing, but I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re that confident. Do you think you can win against me?\u201dAgainst Kishiar la Orr? It was a dangerous conversation. If someone else heard it, Yuder would be reported for the crime of the attempted assassination of the imperial family. But he focused entirely on the meaning.Would Yuder be able to win if he fought against Kishiar?Kishiar\u2019s ability that Yuder had seen before was almost limited to physical ability. Each one seemed to have tremendous power and a high level of magic defense, so if Yuder fought him in person, it would be tricky.\u2018And it\u2019s not like we would go all out\u2026 I guess he\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve ever seen go all out.\u2019Still, Yuder was probably the only one who knew Kishiar\u2019s ability to that extent. It was possible because he followed him around when he was a deputy commander.Kishiar was the type of leader who usually identified the situation and put the necessary talents in the right place when an incident occurred, so he was extremely less likely to come forward himself.It was the opposite of Yuder who would step up before his subordinates and sweep it all away.\u2018I\u2019ve seen one or two abilities he used at a time, but he\u2019s never used them all at once\u2026 Come to think of it, I\u2019ve only heard of it and never seen it in person.\u2019It was during the Red Stone Retrieval mission that Kishiar was known to be the master of the divine sword. Yuder wasn\u2019t included in the mission and didn\u2019t know the detail of what had happened, because all those who had been there were ordered to never speak of it.Later, it was heard that Kishiar first pulled out the divine sword to deal with the enemy\u2019s surprise attack, and the situation was immediately cleared up.That was the first and last time he used the divine sword as far as Yuder knew.What if Kishiar used all his abilities at once and even held the divine sword?\u2018I don\u2019t know how the power of the new sword works\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s more like making it easier to use existing skills.\u2019During training, Kishiar didn\u2019t show his ability directly but participated mainly in teaching. There was a limit to imagining abilities that he didn\u2019t know.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re capable of, Commander-nim.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRather than measuring, Yuder decided to just answer honestly.\u201cThere\u2019s no way that you don\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t you judge the skills of the Imperial Knights without looking at them? For example, alright. What about Nathan behind me now?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026\u201dYuder casually turned to Nathan standing behind Kishiar\u2019s back. At this time in the past, he wouldn\u2019t have known that Nathan was a swordmaster.However, since he was believed to have a very good grasp of other people\u2019s skills, he needed time to think about how to answer properly.\u201cI feel like your aide is a man of unwinnable strength, even compared to all the Imperial Knights I saw today.\u201d\u201cHoo, did you hear that, Nathan? He is regarding you very high.\u201dKishiar smiled. Nathan Zuckerman\u2019s gaze also touched Yuder\u2019s face.\u201cAnd what if he\u2019s compared to you?\u201d\u201cIf compared to me\u2026\u201dYuder paused and let out a small sigh.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I can win right now, but I think it will change over time.\u201d\u2018I didn\u2019t expect it to be this hard to answer what I can see.\u2019Nathan Zuckerman was definitely one of the best sword masters in the world, but Yuder was once a Cavalry commander praised for having no one matching his strength.Currently, he hasn\u2019t fully developed his skills, but if he achieved the same level of development as before, he was confident that he would win even if a few sword masters came all at once.It used to take nearly 10 years to get to that level, but this time, he would walk faster on the path he\u2019d taken once, so he would be able to develop in a much faster time.\u201cHahaha. You said my aide seemed stronger than the mighty men of the Imperial Knights, and now you\u2019re sure that my aide would be weaker than you. What confidence.\u201dKishiar laughed very loudly. Yuder lowered his head slightly, wondering if that man had laughed so well before.\u201cBut you cannot judge my skills?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No.\u201dYuder had no choice but to say so.\u201cHmm. Alright.\u201dFortunately, Kishiar did not ask any more about him. Yuder felt that Kishiar\u2019s red eyes looking at me seemed to be aiming for an interesting game.\u201cThen what about the Cavalry in your eyes? Can you tell me that, too?\u201dYuder thought that man would tell him to go now, but Kishiar asked another question instead. Yuder was taken aback for a moment.As long as he asked for opinions about individuals, he could answer them, but the answer to the entirety of the Cavalry could sound like the activity reviews of Commander Kishiar.Yuder couldn\u2019t understand why Kishiar would ask something he should ask other important people, not a member.\u201cThat\u2026 I think other people could give you a better answer.\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m also asking others. But I\u2019m asking you because you look good enough. I have no intention, so feel free to answer me. Whatever you\u2019ve felt while training. Or something regrettable. I\u2019m not going to kick you out, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYuder turned to Nathan Zuckerman, Kishiar\u2019s aide. He was wondering if he would stop this dangerous conversation, but Nathan was just standing silently looking ahead as if nothing could be heard.\u2018I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s doing this all of a sudden when I don\u2019t remember it happening before. Of course, I will just have to give him a rough answer and get out of here.\u2019\u201cThe Cavalry is\u2026 a good place. Everyone hasn\u2019t fully realized their ability yet, but I think it\u2019s going to develop and complete the system as you wish and contribute to the safety of the Empire.\u201d\u201cYeah. Do you think so?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes.\u201dYuder already knew the future would be like that. Even when Kishiar died, the Cavalry developed and established itself as he said, and became the strongest organization ever before.After a few years, it was only the Cavalry and the Awakeners, not the knights or mages, who could protect the empire and the world. So there was no doubt in answering that.\u201cThat\u2019s interesting. Everyone else says the opposite.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dBlinking back to the unexpected answer. Before he knew it, Kishiar lifted his finished teacup and turned it slightly to the side. Nathan Zuckerman, who approached him, took the teapot with both hands and filled the cup with red water again.\u201cEveryone says I\u2019m going to fail. What can you do without any system and with people you don\u2019t even know? It\u2019s unprecedented because no one in other countries have tried it. We have to make rules and systems from beginning to end.\u201dIn his eyes as red as tea water, a deep thought that Yuder couldn\u2019t know passed by.\u201cThere are already plenty of powerful mages and knights in this country, and all I have in me is my own strength and the support of the Emperor.\u201dAfter saying that, Kishiar suddenly smiled softly.\u201cBut the promising member that passed the entrance test as the best said it doesn\u2019t matter if he is kicked out of the Cavalry, but then he also said that he is sure the Cavalry I\u2019ve created is a good place and will succeed. Isn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was too honest. A word Yuder never thought he would hear from him all in his previous memories.Yuder momentarily doubted whether what I heard was really from Kishiar\u2019s mouth. But the duke in front of him was still drinking tea with a drowsy smile.\u201cI\u2019ve found you quite interesting from the start.\u201dYuder lowered his head to avoid the red eyes, but this time he came to see the red water in the teacup in front of him. There was no escape from the red color.\u201cIf anyone else said so, I would think it was just a good answer. But your eyes seem certain as if seeing what others can\u2019t see. So somehow I\u2019d like to believe it.\u201dWith that said, Kishiar gazed through Yuder.\u201cSo I don\u2019t want you to say you\u2019re leaving without any hesitation next time. That\u2019s all I have to say.\u201dYuder got up, bid goodbye, and left Kishiar\u2019s quarters.He felt a very strange feeling. He didn\u2019t expect to have such a conversation with Kishiar la Orr. The only thing he had left about him was that he was a mysterious creature until the end.\u2018What the hell are you thinking, Kishiar la Orr.\u2019A man who seemed so motivated. Or did he feel something from Yuder?Yuder even wondered if he remembered it wrong because it was strangely different from the man Yuder knew. Or he thought he knew.\u2018He was more pessimistic\u2026 More annoying\u2026 Anyway, I still didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.\u2019But what was clear was that Kishiar on this side was not bad for Yuder.\u2018If I do this well, I won\u2019t be able to take over the commander position like before.\u2019He was sure that was a good thing. However, the strange feeling of seeing Kishiar\u2019s strange appearance did not disappear until he fell asleep and remained deep in Yuder\u2019s mind.* * *\u201cNathan.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter Yuder went out, Kishiar opened his mouth, looking at the cold teacup on the other side. Kishiar\u2019s teacup was empty, but the one on the other side remained intact from the start.\u201cWhat does he look like to you?\u201dIt was an unusual question. Nathan thought about it for a while and began to speak.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t heard from you beforehand, I wouldn\u2019t have thought he was a commoner.\u201dNathan was told that Yuder was only twenty, a commoner and orphan, but he wasn\u2019t intimidated at all not only in front of Nathan but also in front of a duke as precious as heaven.Was that all? With a blank look on his face, he measured his opponent as if he were doing something quite natural.It was a familiar look of judging something, and at the same time, it made him feel like he had long taken it for the upper hand.When their gazes met earlier, Nathan thought briefly of the swordsmanship teacher who taught him as a child.One might think he didn\u2019t know courtesy because he was a commoner, but something was different. That person just went back without drinking a sip of tea like that.Usually, when one thought someone greater than them had given them tea, they wouldn\u2019t ignore it so comfortably and couldn\u2019t stand up.It\u2019d only been two years since he realized his ability. Meanwhile, Nathan Zuckerman grew up rolling all kinds of rough spots with the sword.He\u2019d never seen anyone who\u2019s trained for more than a few times as many years and had so much more.Usually, when someone met Nathan or the Duke, they couldn\u2019t even meet their gaze properly so they flinched and got scared.So how could a 20-year-old man feel that way? The man was\u2026 strange because he wasn\u2019t bold.\u201cHe might have something to hide, so we\u2019d better look into it.\u201d\u201cActually, I\u2019ve already done some investigation. There really wasn\u2019t much.\u201dKishiar smiled.\u201cHe participates hard in training and has excellent grades. If he went to Sul division, I might have offered him the position of deputy commander right away.\u201d\u201cIf I do some investigation again, something might come up.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dHis master that would normally instruct him to do so thoroughly had a somewhat subtle expression. A strange smile that he seemed to hold back appeared and disappeared.\u201cMaybe we need more people like him here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And against the Diarca Duchy at that.\u201dNathan shut up at those words. A hint of joy sparkled in Kishiar\u2019s red eyes.\u201cIt was a very interesting sight. It\u2019s a shame I can\u2019t show you.\u201dKnowing how much Kishiar disliked the nobles and the Four Dukes, Nathan sighed at the smile of his heartfelt master.\u201cYou must have liked him a lot.\u201d\u201cLike him\u2026 Well, yeah. I think so.\u201dHe was interesting and unique. From the beginning, Kishiar\u2019s eyes were on him. With such a murmur, Kishiar rose from his seat.\u201cCome to think of it, Nathan, did you receive anything while I was out?\u201d\u201cYes, there was a message from the Sun Palace.\u201dNathan handed a short letter to his master from the leg of a carrier pigeon that flew to him just before Yuder came in.The Sun Palace was where only the emperor of the Orr Empire could stay, and even a small rolled letter was stamped with the emperor\u2019s symbol, the sun pattern, clearly visible on the wax sealed with paper.Kishiar took it, opened the seal, and quickly read it down.\u201cHmm. It says, \u2018Bring me the Red Stone as soon as the ceremony is over\u2019\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say the ceremony is the day after tomorrow?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s going to be a pretty tight schedule.\u201dKishiar threw the paper into the central fireplace. The paper thrown into the flames of the mana stone, burning in five brilliant colors, quickly burnt away without a trace.\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem to retrieve it. However, the Calvary system is not fully established yet. I\u2019m a little worried about what might happen while I\u2019m away for a long time.\u201d\u201cBut please don\u2019t overdo it. The Peletta Knights are on standby, so if you tell me the number ofpeople you need, I shall have them ready.\u201dKishiar turned his head toward Nathan. He furrowed his eyebrows and smiled softly as if he were doing nothing.\u201cYou\u2019re worrying so much, Nathan. I think my late mother would be less worried about me than you.\u201d\u201cEveryone else is worried after your Awakening, Duke-nim. If your plate gets worse\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know my body the best.\u201dKishiar quietly cut off his aide\u2019s words.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong so far.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I speak too forward of myself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. And the Knights\u2026 Yeah, make sure about five people are prepared.\u201d\u201cFive is too few. Then I will join you-\u201d\u201cYou have to act on my behalf here. When the Sun Palace calls, who else will get it if not you?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dHe would take only five people to carry an unknown object called the Red Stone. No matter how little Kishiar himself tried, the number was too small.\u201cI have to go quickly, so I can\u2019t move heavy. And there are only five knights, so I think I\u2019ll pick a few people from here to join the mission.\u201d\u201cFrom here\u2026?\u201dKnowing that it meant the organization his master made, Nathan\u2019s voice inevitably worried.Kishiar continued with a look as if he knew it by heart.\u201cDidn\u2019t you just see? This is where someone who said he could win against you if he has more time comes from. I\u2019ve been looking at a lot of people with quite interesting abilities. They\u2019re the ones who got the power from the stone, so maybe it will be of help. In many ways, it\u2019s the best opportunity to make the name of the Cavalry known worldwide.\u201dHis master had already made a decision. Kishiar was not a man who changed his mind once he decided on something.Nathan looked at him for a moment and lowered his head.\u201cYes, sir. So are you going to take him with you?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201dKishiar smiled softly again, talking about Yuder.\u201cI wanted to take a closer look and see how confident he is because he has so much power. His attitude that doesn\u2019t care whether it\u2019s a noble or imperial family is very interesting. Don\u2019t you think he will be pretty fun to poke at?\u201d\u201cPlease do not develop too much interest.\u201dNathan\u2019s icy face was worried about him. Kishiar la Orr didn\u2019t pay much attention to something, but once something interesting happened, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate until he solved it.Until now, his master\u2019s disposition never caused any major problems. But he thought if his master\u2019s interest in a commoner man he just met deepened, it might become a problem for the first time. Too little had been revealed about Awakeners since two years ago. As long as it wasn\u2019t fully known how strong he had power, he had to prevent anything that might harm his master as much as possible.\u201cHaha. Just in case I get hurt?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I know it won\u2019t happen, but there\u2019s a possibility.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Nathan. If it was so common to hurt me, there would be no reason to suffer.\u201dKishiar patted Nathan on the shoulder.\u201cIt\u2019s a boring life where I have to catch anything and release what I\u2019ve accumulated inside forcefully. By comparison, it\u2019s natural and interesting.\u201d\u201c..Well, now you should go in and rest, too.\u201dLowering his head at his master who said so, Nathan stepped down from his quarters and entered another room for him.Even after the faithful aide disappeared, Kishiar la Orr stood still in front of the burning central fireplace without getting into bed.Unlike the red flame made by burning wood, the fire produced by burning the magic stones created a mysterious five-color, burning more than 10 days with a handful of stones without spraying any soot or ash. Moreover, it was possible to create such a beautiful type of fireplace because it didn\u2019t require ventilation.When first invented, it was treated as magic by the wood-burning fire and mages, but now it could be seen anywhere.That\u2019s why Kishiar la Orr specifically instructed to install the fireplace at the very center of his place to stay.Would the results he created here be considered like the fire? The answer was not yet known.***Two days later, a surname ceremony was held at an open space in front of the accommodation where the Cavalry members stayed, involving more than half of the entire members of the Cavalry.It was a special ceremony that had only been held a few times in the empire\u2019s history for more than a thousand years. The faces of the members who received a surname directly from the emperor were filled with emotion.\u2018Even though the reality is shabby.\u2019Yuder stood in a black uniform as one of them. Originally, an event such as a ceremony should be attended by the emperor who would give them a surname or name.However, the number of people to be granted was too high, and it\u2019d already been several years since the emperor didn\u2019t properly appear at a meeting to discuss state affairs because of health reasons.Therefore, the venue for the ceremony was not an imperial palace, but a small vacant lot in front of the Cavalry building. And instead of the emperor, it was the Cavalry Commander, Kishiar la Orr, carrying a royal edict bearing the seal and standing on the podium. It was no different from what it looked like when the members were gathered and announced.But that alone was enough to impress the members. Receiving a surname meant escaping commoner status and rising above them. The commoners were freed from many hard duties, given many benefits, and could pass on their surnames to their families.In other words, a family could be formed. They could even become nobles, although they were not the same as nobles with territories and titles.When a commoner became a knight, the only occupation that could aim for advancement in status, they were given the title of \u2018Sir\u2019. And the title couldn\u2019t be passed on to his family, which was an incomparably better benefit.That was exactly what it meant to be called.\u201cAnd it\u2019s a surname that His Majesty the Emperor gives. Oh my God, it feels unreal.\u201dAs the name was called one after another, Kanna, who was next to Yuder, held her cheek with a moved face.\u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything yet and I don\u2019t know if we really deserve all this.\u201d\u201cOf course, you can take it. Later, you\u2019ll get used to getting more rewards every time you come back after completing a big mission.\u201dIn Yuder\u2019s case as the commander back then, he received lands and a surname from the emperor himself. And how many mansions did he get in the Capital?With so many rare treasures, servants, and all kinds of honorable titles, none of them seemed meaningful later on. It was rather a funny memory to think about now.\u201cYuder, aren\u2019t you happy? Smile a little more.\u201d\u201cI am happy.\u201dKanna whispered, lowering her voice as if Yuder\u2019s expression of recalling the past seemed stark.He answered but did not seem convincing.\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re happy? I don\u2019t think so\u2026\u201d\u201cNext up is Kanna.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dLuckily, at that moment, Kanna\u2019s name was called. Yuder watched Kanna go up to the podium.\u201cI hereby bestow Kanna of the Cavalry the honorable surname \u2018Wand\u2019.\u201d\u201cI- thank you very much.\u201dKanna Wand, who received the new surname, turned back and greeted with tears in her eyes.That was the only view that didn\u2019t exist in the past.\u201cNext, Yuder.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he walked out of the line, Gakane, the red-haired young man who stood out among the crowds outside the vacant lot, waved at him with a happy face.The Cavalry members who already had a surname didn\u2019t have to attend the ceremony, but most of them watched from outside the vacant lot like Gakane, giving them a big round of applause and cheers.The Imperial Knights, who passed by scoffing, were sometimes seen, but no one cared.Yuder took a look at Gakane and continued to walk up the podium. On the podium stood Kishiar, dressed in an imperial robe on top of the white uniform he usually wore.The shining red eyes under the golden hair like the sun were as beautiful as the painting of the Sun God in the temple.But the way he looked at Yuder was shining with interest.\u201cI expected it, but there\u2019s really no sign of nervousness.\u201d\u201cShould I be nervous?\u201dBefore raising his voice loudly, he smiled even deeper as Yuder tilted his head and replied back to Kishiar, who spoke quietly.\u201cNo, I would\u2019ve been disappointed if you were.\u201d\u201cHm.. alright.\u201dIt was the second time he\u2019d been through it anyway. Was he a little nervous before? I couldn\u2019t remember very well.Yuder knew everything without seeing what was written on the paper that Kishiar was holding. Towards Yuder\u2019s expressionless face, Kishiar slowly raised his voice and opened his mouth, \u201cI hereby bestow an honorable surname. \u2018Aile\u2019 to Yuder of the Cavalry.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAs expected, the surname he received didn\u2019t change. It was the same as the \u201cAile\u201d from where he lived. However, it wasn\u2019t bad to have the name of Yuder Aile, the member, not Yudrain Aile, the commander. He decided to think so.Yuder went down the podium without looking back at Kishiar. Not far away, Gakane was smiling broadly and shouting congratulations.\u201cYuder! There\u2019s going to be a celebration party. We should go.\u201dAfter the ceremony, Gakane ran after Yuder who was heading for the accommodation. He wrapped his shoulders and shouted brightly.\u201c\u2026Where?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bar outside the Imperial Knights estate. Juan contacted me already and said he emptied everything. A three-story building won\u2019t be short of people. They\u2019re all going.\u201dHe asked just in case, but the answer came back as expected. Yuder recalled his old memories, spilling Gakane\u2019s words with one ear.\u2018I think I was training by myself in the past, refusing to go.\u2019Not long after joining the cavalry, Yuder didn\u2019t understand the motives for clinging to friendship. At that time, what was important to him was to prove to himself how far his power could develop.There was nothing interesting except building up strength, so even then, he resisted the recommendation that someone had made and just trained at the training ground all day.He still didn\u2019t like drinking or social gatherings. However, since he became the commander of the group, he had been called by the emperor\u2019s orders, so he understood that there was a place in the world where he had to go even though he hated it.This was nothing compared to all the dirty meetings he had attended back then.And now his goals were different.Currently, Yuder\u2019s goal was to prepare for future disasters by preventing as many talents from escaping from the Cavalry, not to increase his own power.\u2018I can always improve my abilities again. But I know once I lost someone, it\u2019s lost forever.\u2019\u201cSo let\u2019s go, Yuder. It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201dYuder answered quietly following Gakane\u2019s last remark, which had been much chatter. Then Gakane let out a relieved sigh and hugged him tightly.\u201cWell thought! I was actually a little worried that you wouldn\u2019t go.\u201dIt\u2019d been a long time since he was hugged by someone. In an unfamiliar mood, Yuder blinked, and Gakane let go of the arm hugging him in surprise.\u201cAh, sorry. Did you feel uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s go. Everyone\u2019s going to be waiting.\u201dGakane grinned and led Yuder by the arm.Yuder left the Cavalry site for the first time after joining. After a long time, the waterway was still noisy and full of people who had a headache.Gakane escaped with surprising smoothness. Yuder admired him a little.\u201cIt\u2019s here. The Black Whale! They said it\u2019s an inn, but it\u2019s really big, isn\u2019t it?\u201dFinally, the destination appeared. As they approached the neat wooden building that Gakane pointed to, they heard louder and louder laughter. Many people had already arrived.\u201cI\u2019m here! Yuder too!\u201dCheers burst out as Gakane, who grabbed Yuder\u2019s arm, pushed the door into his chest.\u201cGakane finally brought Yuder!\u201d\u201cI won my bet, so everyone who lost, throw me a coin!\u201d\u201cHey, I bet on the wrong side.\u201dSomeone grumbled and tossed a copper coin. Beyond the second floor and on the third floor, someone with a hat spilled coins and received them all.It wasn\u2019t just a good athletic ability, but a simple use of the ability to generate wind. The sound of laughter filled the bar.\u201cGakane, Yuder! Over here!\u201dKanna, who was sitting not far away, waved her hand. Yuder sat next to her with Gakane. He saw familiar faces.Not long ago, Ever, whom he met during training at the Imperial Knights\u2019 First Training Center, and Kurga, who had a bear-like impression as a roommate before, were seated at a round table. There were already several bottles of alcohol on the table with quite a lot of dishes.\u201cI bet Yuder would be coming. I\u2019m already looking forward to the dividend because it\u2019s going to be a little salty.\u201d As Kanna smiled brightly, a voice of regret and joy burst out at the same time.\u201cDon\u2019t be so mean. What if he doesn\u2019t want to come next time? Why are you all betting so openly?\u201d (Gakane)\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think Yuder would even care about those stupid nobles of the Imperial Knights. Right?\u201d (Ever)Gakane pushed the alcohol glass in front of Yuder with a worried look. Yuder gave a brief \u201cYes\u201d answer to Ever, who held out her head in defiance of Gakane\u2019s comment.\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cLook, Gakane, you\u2019re being too careful with Yuder. But now that I\u2019ve made money, should I say thank you for today?\u201d\u201cKanna\u2026\u201dGakane shook his head and sighed as if he couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cWell, then let\u2019s start celebrating in earnest since we\u2019re all here except for our young comrades who can\u2019t come here and those who have their reasons! A toast to our fellow friends who have been bestowed surnames!\u201d\u201cWoohoo!\u201dThe Cavalry members raised their glasses in unison.\u201cCheers to His Majesty the Emperor\u2019s glory and to our noble commander!\u201d\u201cCheers!\u201dThen the raucous party began in earnest. While walking freely around the table, drinking and eating as much as they wanted, only bright smiles and happiness floated everywhere.The atmosphere heated up even more when someone from Sul division, a former wandering band, managed to play exciting music with an old stringed instrument and a flute lying in the corner of the bar.One by one, comrades sitting at Yuder\u2019s table left for another table or went out dancing. Yuder leaned against the wall and drank as he watched Gakane dance quite nicely. Even he was at a loss.When he didn\u2019t come here in his previous life, did they party in this atmosphere? Yuder didn\u2019t feel so bad just watching, but when he thought he didn\u2019t come at the so he had a bit of a bitter smile.\u2018I think it\u2019s much better than a sickly noble party.\u2019Although few people spoke openly to Yuder, all of his comrades with eye contact raised their glasses even from afar with a light smile and showed a toast.There was no negative feeling in their eyes towards Yuder. It was thanks to the fact that they knew everything about the incident at the Imperial Knight\u2019s training ground two days ago.The Cavalry members were in a state of disarray between the power they suddenly had and the original world perception that was separated. They were confident of winning, but they kept losing their nerves in front of noble knights weaker than them.Although not all of the Awakeners had high status, they were forced to distance themselves from the members of the common people even though they didn\u2019t apply for the Cavalry or come in.However, Yuder\u2019s incident was more than enough to give everyone a tremendous stimulus and cool vicarious satisfaction.A commoner-born cavalry member proudly confronted the knight of a Duchy family with only one strength, and the commander, Kishiar, expressed that he would protect any Cavalry members under him.Regardless of the origin, he delivered a message that the Cavalry would take precedence from now on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPreviously, Yuder was a dark and mysterious, but with powerful willpower among the Cavalry members.However, after the incident, he began to be recognized as a reliable person when something happened and a decent person to stand before themAmong the 300 people who were busy adjusting to each other and had nothing to do, there appeared a person who they thought would be okay to be the leader implicitly.The fact that Commander Kishiar took the side of the Cavalry, not the noble, made it easier for them to receive training, and their sense of camaraderie grew exponentially.Previously, only roommates and some of their congenial comrades were close. But two days ago, even if they did not know their faces and names well, it was evident that they began to treat each other without hesitation.Neither gender nor the original status was important anymore. Under the same black uniform they were all wearing, they were equal.Yuder didn\u2019t know that the Cavalry members had such an idea, but he felt that the expressions that looked at him had changed from before.It was the first time he saw equal intimacy in the faces of the Cavalry members that he saw, not the desire to win against the strong or the signs of random difficulty. It was a strange feeling that he didn\u2019t know until he regressed.\u201cJeez. They keep asking me to dance again whenever I try to step back. I\u2019m sorry, Yuder.\u201dGakane, who had barely returned after three dances with different partners, sat down in front of Yuder, wiping off the sweat slightly formed on his forehead, and gulped in his drink.\u201cWhat do you say, the party isn\u2019t so bad, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cYes, I thought so.\u201dGakane smiled and began to talk about the story he picked up during the dance.\u201cI heard that the Commander pays all the expenses we spent here today. He said it would be worthwhile to join us, but he said we need more time to spend with fellow members. He is a great guy.\u201dKishiar did? That was a fact he didn\u2019t know.\u2018If I think about it\u2026 It must\u2019ve cost a lot of money to rent the whole bar.\u2019It would\u2019ve been a lot of money for the members, but it wouldn\u2019t have been ticklish for Kishiar.When Yuder was also the commander, he had several times asked to prepare meals and drinking parties to raise the morale of the members, but he had left the room simply because he didn\u2019t want to attend.Did the members interpret Yuder\u2019s intentions in a good way like Kishiar? Now he didn\u2019t know, but he was a little curious.\u201cYuder! Do you know how to dance?\u201dThen Ever, with a slightly red face, appeared and asked.\u201cHe can\u2019t dance. He can\u2019t!\u201dGakane desperately stood before Yuder, but it was useless in front of Ever\u2019s finger. Gakane flew out of the way in a flash just by her slight push\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cGakane, I didn\u2019t ask you. I asked Yuder. You\u2019re noisy, really.\u201d\u201cI know how to dance.\u201dYuder opened his mouth as he glanced at Gakane, who was being rescued by the laughter of other colleagues from afar.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to dance now. It\u2019s better to just stay like this.\u201d\u201cReally? What a shame. I like dancing.\u201dEver smiled.\u201cWhen I first came here, I never thought I\u2019d ever have to dance and talk to anyone like this again. But I\u2019m happy to know that I\u2019m wrong. It\u2019s all thanks to Yuder.\u201d\u201cIf you didn\u2019t step up to them, I wouldn\u2019t think I could enjoy it like this.\u201dYuder looked at Ever and put down the glass he was holding in his hand.\u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201dIt was true that he came before the knights, but he didn\u2019t come forward with a pure purpose enough to hear that from Ever. Rather, it was enough to blame knights from nobility for having a quarrel.\u201cI didn\u2019t have a huge goal, and even if it wasn\u2019t me, someone would have stepped up soon. I\u2019m glad it helped, but don\u2019t think it\u2019s because of me.\u201dThe reason why Yuder stepped up at that time was simple. It was nothing more than because he thought the only person who could stand out the most without being intimidated at the time was Yuder himself who had already experienced those times and gotten used to standing in front of the others as the Cavalry commander for nearly 10 years.Now, he was thinking of never aiming for the top, but instead as a member of the group. However, the years he\u2019d lived in front of them remained as a duty and a sense of debt deep down in Yuder\u2019s heart.He didn\u2019t know the importance of each of them before. He thought he could do everything by himself, so he hit the wall and was wary.But he didn\u2019t realize it until the time of his death. It wasn\u2019t the condescending emperor, or the nobles themselves, but other beings with the same power that could help Yuder.\u201cNo matter what happened, it would end up like that.\u201dYes. Even if there was no Yuder, the Cavalry would eventually realize that they were much stronger than the Imperial Knights and the Pearl Tower mages. They deserved to be paid as much as they did for their country.Yuder\u2019s actions were just trying to reduce a little bit of trial and error until the future came.He had to correct this Cavalry.Too many people, who were the backbone and core of the Cavalry, disappeared in the early and mid-stage due to accidents caused by ignorance or little discrimination that could have been simply prevented in the future.Furthermore, the commander, Kishiar, who could\u2019ve been much more supportive than Yuder, died as soon as he made Yuder commander. Once that was corrected, it would\u2019ve been a tremendous boost to prevent future disasters.\u201c\u2026That sounds like a prophecy, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dEver, who was blinking his eyes, soon smiled.\u201cIt\u2019s not a prophecy, it\u2019s a fact.\u201d\u201cI hope so. So far, I\u2019m not used to being looked down on for daring to set foot in a precious place. I hope that someday I will be able to step forward like Yuder and say that I\u2019m ignoring others weaker than me.\u201d\u201cThat will happen for sure.\u201dYuder said with confidence. In the future or past where he lived, Ever was one of the earliest members of the Cavalry who was working hard until the end.She was very famous within the Cavalry as she pushed incompetents who believed in their lineage without blinking an eye in a cold manner.Now she was dancing with a much softer expression, but Yuder didn\u2019t think that she was weaker than her future self.The only thing lacking was experience. She could\u2019ve changed as much as she could in the future if it were filled.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s have another toast for that future.\u201dYuder bumped his glass into Ever\u2019s without saying a word.\u201cYuder, did you manifest a second gender?\u201d\u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d\u201cI heard I\u2019m an Alpha, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the difference yet.\u201dA few more years later, there was a trend that it was impolite to openly ask whether someone had a second gender or not. But not now.Yet the world knew little about the existence of Alpha and Omega. It was unfamiliar and free.How could this atmosphere last forever? Yuder nodded, swallowing the idea inwardly.\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201d\u201cWhat is the power of the Red Stone? The invisible thing gave us a lot of strength and even changed our natural gender. Everything about me has changed and I don\u2019t even know what the stone is about. Is it really the power of the Sun God, as the priests say?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dThen Gakane, who\u2019d been held by other comrades, managed to return and sit next to him. Ever began to speak.\u201cIs the power of the Red Stone really the power of the Sun God? Have you ever wondered? Was I the only one curious?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m curious, too, but I\u2019m sure we will find out someday when we are in the Cavalry.\u201dGakane answered with his eyes slightly round.\u201cThere\u2019s a saying that the reason for Cavalry\u2019s formation was to retrieve the Red Stone and protect it.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dEver sighed. Gakane\u2019s words were one of the strong rumors that had circulated together since the initial announcement of the Cavalry recruitment came down to the country. Yuder had heard such rumors in his old memories.\u2018In the end, it\u2019s half right and half wrong.\u2019The Red Stone that Kishiar recovered was refined in the Pearl Tower over a year. After that, it would be named the World Sphere and enshrined in the deepest forest of the sanctuary located north of the capital.It was close to a seal, but one of the main duties of the Cavalry was to keep the useless individuals out of there.There were only two people who could access it without anyone\u2019s permission. One was the emperor, and the other was the Cavalry commander, Yuder.Thinking about it, he somehow felt as if his intact mana hole was poking. Yuder frowned.\u2018Come to think of it, the time to retrieve the Red Stone\u2026 won\u2019t it be soon?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yuder was fine, but Kanna and Gakane, both standing on each side, were faceless.\u201cYuder, I think you\u2019ve had quite a lot of drink, but why are you still fine?\u201d\u201cIs that an ability, too?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Something like that.\u201dHis ability to freely handle all nature\u2019s attributes made him not influenced by water and grain alcohol.The only thing that could harm his body was something not naturally created in this world.\u2018I could get drunk from monster\u2019s blood, though.\u2019That kind of \u2018alcohol\u2019 was commonly used with the intention to poison someone. But for Yuder, he\u2019d get drunk after consuming it instead of getting killed.\u2018I remember being surprised after learning that someone sent it to kill me but I ended up getting drunk instead.\u2019\u201cI\u2019m so jealous. It would\u2019ve been better if I had that ability, too.\u201dAt the same time as Kanna whined, Kishiar raised his voice from afar and began to speak.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for those not feeling well after yesterday\u2019s activity, but the first mission has come down to the Cavalry. Five of these people will be packing up and leaving with me today.\u201d\u201cA mission already? What on earth?\u201d\u201cFive people?\u201dKishiar\u2019s words immediately spread buzzing around. All the members forgot their hangovers and got all worked up. How could they not?Finally, it was the first time since the creation of the Cavalry to appear under its official name. Anyone on any mission wanted their names to be called within those five.And today Yuder was one of them.\u2018Is it today that he announced the Red Stone Retrieval Operation? This fast?\u2019In the past, he thought they retrieved the Red Stone after receiving surnames, but Yuder couldn\u2019t remember how fast it was. Because Yuder wasn\u2019t interested in such things at that time.\u2018Back then, there were 2 people from Sul, 2 from Shin, and 1 from Jung division.\u2019He looked back hard at the blurry memories of the past. At that time, Kishiar chose those with somewhat unusual abilities rather than those considered to have strong abilities.All of the selected people signed a pledge not to talk about what happened during the mission until they died, and despite a minor accident on the way, they succeeded in retrieving the Red Stone safely and returning.\u2018After that, the world knew that Kishiar la Orr was chosen by the divine sword because of the accident that happened.\u2019Yuder back then was disappointed that he wasn\u2019t selected, and afterward, he stopped paying attention and focused more on training. When Kishiar was found to be the master of the divine sword, Yuder just treated it as another person\u2019s business.After that, he was busy after being elected as the deputy commander of Sul division, and then suddenly took over the commander position, forcing Kishiar to retire and return to Peletta Duchy.As time went by, the stone was safely asleep in the sanctuary. But Yuder couldn\u2019t care less about the World Sphere.However, when many things happened afterward and disasters came, and the moment he felt that only he knew the great disaster was weighing on the world, Yuder felt the need to investigate the events related to the world once again.The reason was simple. Because he needed power to protect the world, and he judged that there was no object in the world that had as much power as the World Sphere made by refining the Red Stones.The problem was the original power of the World Sphere was largely damaged and crushed by rough refining work in the Pearl Tower, almost sealed.The mages of the Pearl Tower said that they\u2019d only carved impurities from the Red Stone, but it turned out to be the opposite.Even if Yuder wanted to tell them to take it back, the Pearl Tower had long collapsed. Yuder thought he should investigate the situation when the World Sphere was still just the Red Stone and restore its original power.So, since the Red Stone was discovered, I\u2019ve belatedly investigated the situation after the retrieval\u2026It was hard to know what happened at the time because so many years had passed already.What was certain, however, was that all the Cavalry members selected by Kishiar who went on the mission together ended up retiring, disappearing, or dying in the middle of a mission.Yuder needed strength, but he couldn\u2019t find a way to get it or anyone who had it. To make matters worse, Yuder, who began to investigate past events for the source of the power, was exposed to many doubts and limitations.Perhaps from then on. The world that Yuder built began to crumble down.\u2018I don\u2019t know based on what criteria Kishiar chose at the time, but if it\u2019s the same, it\u2019s highly likely that it won\u2019t be me.\u2019What should he do if he didn\u2019t get picked again this time? Should he visit Kishiar in person and warn him of something? While he was thinking about it, Kishiar slowly began to call out the names of those who would leave with him.\u201cFinn Eldore, Hinn Eldore, of Sul division.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201dWhile everyone was enthusiastic, only Yuder was shocked.\u2018No, those are not the names called in the past. I\u2019m sure it used to be\u2026\u2019Was it Isis and Edin? He remembered that perhaps those people were chosen. It was never as conspicuous as Finn and Hinn.Yuder turned to Finn and Hinn the twins who shared surprise not far away. The blue-haired siblings, who have an interstellar face like a fairy, chose Sul division, not Shin, even though they had the ability to strengthen their bodies.Actually, the reason why they chose Sul was simple. It was to develop another ability to move, which could only be used when the two were together.Even though it was revealed, many people thought their talents should have blossomed more in Shin division.Yuder also felt the same way for he had put them primarily on tasks that require physical ability.\u2018Mobility is useful, but it\u2019s not necessary. It hasn\u2019t been long since that man knew their abilities and the prerequisites are tricky. He knew that, but why did he choose them? He didn\u2019t back then, so why?\u2019\u201cNext. Kanna Wand of Jung division.\u201d\u201cMe? Really?\u201dKanna looked around with a puzzled face. She was also, of course, an unidentified person before.\u2018There\u2019s already a third person not selected in the past. If so\u2026\u2019The next people to be called might not be the same as before. Yuder looked only at Kishiar on the podium, ignoring members who secretly made a scene around Kanna.Kishiar\u2019s lips opened slowly.\u201cNext. Gakane Bolunwald, and Yuder Aile of Shin division. The five of you will pack simply and come to my quarter as soon as you\u2019re done.\u201dYuder Aile.\u00a0The voice stuck deep in Yuder\u2019s ear.\u201cNo way\u2026 We both got picked, Yuder. Is this for real?\u201dEven the sound of Gakane talking next to him sounded far away. Yuder looked at him briefly and thought blankly about the disappeared face of Kishiar, realizing that the future he knew was changing.\u2018All five selected names are different from the past, so I didn\u2019t expect to be selected.\u2019It was fortunate that he didn\u2019t have to visit Kishiar personally and apply to join.After Kishiar disappeared, the vacant field where the members gathered was mixed with those who couldn\u2019t hide their excitement and those who disappeared with disappointment.In an instant, Yuder was trapped between those rushing to talk to him, as well as Gakane and Kanna.\u201cWhat the hell is the standard? Congratulations. Make sure you succeed in your mission and return safely!\u201d\u201cYou have to come back and tell me what you did!\u201dThey\u2019d probably have to sign a confidentiality pledge so they wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the others what happened. But Kanna and Gakane, who didn\u2019t know it, were puzzled and said yes.\u2018\u2026 What the hell are you thinking, Kishiar la Orr.\u2019Yuder was lost in thought as he watched the scene. It wasn\u2019t difficult to guess that Kishiar\u2019s mind had changed from the past.***It didn\u2019t take long to pack because he had little luggage in the first place. And the only clothes he could wear were the Cavalry uniforms.As Yuder went up to the floor where Kishiar\u2019s accommodation was, he saw the rest of the group arriving in advance. The luggage everyone had was very simple.As soon as Kanna greeted him with a nervous face and Gakane smiled brightly as if he had met the light in the dark, the two short people jumped out of the side and talked to him first.\u201cHi, you\u2019re Yuder?\u201d\u201cThe one that others said facing the Imperial Knights alone?\u201dHinn Eldore, Finn Eldore. For the first time since Yuder regressed, he personally saw the two siblings again. Their tone of speaking was still straightforward enough to feel a bit rude.They were a handful of comrades who used to talk casually to Yuder, who had never approached anyone before. A faint smile came out at the attitude of meeting them again, which was nothing short of memory.\u201cYeah.\u201dWhen Yuder nodded down at them, the sister, Hinn, came forward and introduced herself.\u201cI\u2019m Finn. This is my brother Finn.\u201d\u201cIf you think we look too alike that you can\u2019t tell who is who, just call us Eldore.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIf you think we look too alike that you can\u2019t tell who is who, just call us Eldore.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay because I can tell.\u201d\u201cReally? How?\u201d\u201cEven our parents sometimes can\u2019t tell us apart.\u201dNo matter how hard it was to tell who was who, their energy was slightly different, so Yuder could only distinguish them through it.He didn\u2019t think they would understand if he explained, so he agonized for a moment. Fortunately, however, the door with a golden lion knob opened, showing up Kishiar\u2019s aide, Nathan Zuckerman.\u201cIs everyone here already?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Nathan Zuckerman, the Commander\u2019s aide. I will let you know about this mission before he arrives. You can ask questions after I\u2019m done explaining.\u201dBoth Nathan Zuckerman\u2019s exotic features and cold expressions made it difficult for the members to open their mouths easily. Even the frank Eldore siblings didn\u2019t.Nathan continued nonchalantly as if he were accustomed to that gaze.\u201cThis mission is very important because it is under the order of His Majesty the Emperor. You may think it\u2019s just a return to the capital by retrieving the Red Stone, but we don\u2019t know all the power behind it yet. That\u2019s why we have to prepare thoroughly. It\u2019s unlikely, but maybe a third force will intervene in the middle, aiming for the Red Stone. Therefore, the Duke- no, the Commander has selected five knights of the Peletta Duchy who are proficient in this mission to join in. I want you to cooperate with the knights when something happens that you don\u2019t think you can solve with your own power.\u201d\u201cAre you coming too, sir aide?\u201dWhen Hinn raised her hand and asked, Nathan shook his head.\u201cNo, I will be staying here to act as the Commander\u2019s Lieutenant.\u201d\u201cHow long will it take?\u201d\u201cHe said it would take about a week.\u201dA week. Yuder pondered upon the plan that was much earlier than expected.\u2018I don\u2019t know how long it was going to take to get there.\u2019Yuder remembered that he, who lived near where the Red Stone fell, spent almost 15 days only coming to the capital after taking a test to join the Cavalry.Of course, it must\u2019ve been slow because he was young at the time and didn\u2019t know how to find his way. Still, no matter how fast he moved, it was questionable if they could perform this mission within a week.\u2018How long did it take for Kishiar to finish up? I think it took more than a week. Did he consider the Red Stone? Is the retrieval mission easy? Or was the given time limited by the Emperor?\u2019The current emperor was the predecessor of the emperor that Yuder had served, so he didn\u2019t know how to handle things. However, the emperor that Yuder worked under back then would order Yuder to finish the missions under a time limit.If the current emperor had such a personality, it would be understandable that he was trying to move so fast.\u201cMy goodness. I guess I\u2019m the last one.\u201dAt last, Kishiar appeared from the inside. He was dressed in a black cape over a white-clad uniform and with a sword. The hood of his cape was big enough to cover his face whenever he wanted.Everyone else seemed to be overwhelmed by his extraordinary atmosphere and elegant beauty, but Yuder was the one to notice the splendid appearance of the sword Kishiar was wearing.\u2018He\u2019s bringing it, too.\u2019The Divine Sword.But no one but Nathan and Yuder could even imagine it was the legendary Divine Sword.\u201cWe will not use wagons for fast transportation. Is there anyone who can\u2019t ride by horse?\u201dHorses were the most common means of land transport. There was even a joke that there were more horses than dogs and cats on this continent.In particular, the Orr Empire was famous for paving the way for wagons from a long time ago, as most of them consisted of plains.Therefore, all Orr people learned how to ride horses from an early age. Even Yuder who grew up alone with his grandfather in the mountains also learned how to ride a horse and drive a cart.\u201cWe can.\u201dAfter seeing everyone nod, Kishiar gave a signal to Nathan. Nathan, who greeted him with a gentle manner, went down first.\u201cThe horses we\u2019re going to ride aren\u2019t normal horses. Maybe you\u2019ve heard it at least once. We will ride the Mist horses brought by the mages of the Pearl Tower.\u201d\u201cMist horses\u2026\u201dKanna muttered mysteriously. Yuder, of course, knew what it was.\u2018Mixed species created by magic.\u2019Once upon a time, the mages of the Pearl Tower did a lot more extraordinary experiments than now.The most useful was the birth of Mist horses made by hybridizing horses with ancient monsters that lived only in fog and storms.\u2018I never thought I\u2019d ride it. Come to think of it, they must still be used a lot by this time. I forgot.\u2019Mist horses were alive, but no matter how long they ran, they wouldn\u2019t be as tired as a real horse and left no footprints. Instead of mane, they were made to listen only to mages commanding them through the stone lodged in their bodies.Since they were not truly alive, they could travel much faster than real horses, but most of them were used by mages from the Pearl Tower because of the small population.But, only the Pearl Tower mages knew how to create a Mist horse.Good thing they dug up the secret of making the horses before they collapsed. Because of that, even after the terrible mixed breed disappeared, the technique could still be used elsewhere.Old mages who have been stuck in towers for many years and stubbornly abiding by their own rules. Until the Cavalry was made, they were the only people in the world who had the power to work miracles.It was them who felt the fate that the Cavalry would replace them and protested the most. And it was them who engaged in excessive interference and occasional attacks. In the end, their greed brought anger.The Mist horses naturally disappeared together after the tower collapsed. Yuder followed Kishiar downstairs, recalling another tower and its iconic monster years later.\u201cYour Highness, these are the Mist horses you\u2019ve instructed us to prepare.\u201dIn front of the entrance intentionally vacated, four mages in robes with pearl buttons, which could be seen as mages from the Pearl Tower, were dragging several Mist horses. The figure was simply spectacular.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dMost people never get a chance to see Mist horses.The horses\u2019 appearance was forced to be visible by spraying a handful of silver powder at where the whirlwind gathered. They were also huge enough to look twice the size of a normal horse.They needed reins and mana crystals made of special materials in order to keep the horses controlled.Every time the Mist horses tied to the red reins held by the mages rolled their feet, only the sound of wind blowing spread quietly over the shadowless ground.Looking at the beast\u2019s black hole-like eyes, Yuder didn\u2019t like the look of them.\u201cThey look amazing. They\u2019re glowing silver, too. Does it sparkle like that at night?\u201d\u201cYeah, but not enough to catch the attention of a beast or a monster.\u201dBeasts or monsters rather avoided Mist horses. Because something not born naturally tended to be ostracized anywhere.Only humans tried to distort and exploit it.Yuder, who unconsciously answered Kanna\u2019s self-talk, blinked after a while, feeling the gaze toward him.\u201cHow do you know that? Have you seen one before?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve heard about it. There was a mage I met while passing by.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dFortunately, his comrades did not question the authenticity of the answer. It was the same for everyone who traveled to the Capital for a long time just a few months ago, away from where they used to live all their life.\u201cDuke-nim. It\u2019s been a while.\u201dAs they waited a little longer, knights wearing light armor appeared not far away and rebuffed themselves in front of Kishiar.Compared to the shining armor of the Imperial Knights, they were dressed as simple mercenaries, but the pattern on their capes was the same as the flame pattern used by the Duke of Peletta.They were the Knights of Kishiar\u2019s Peletta Duchy.\u201cWe had a hard time getting eleven Mist horses. These guys have a habit of trying to fight each other when they\u2019re gathered, so when you tie them, you will have to keep them at a distance. You don\u2019t need a saddle, but you will need a signal of a certain sound to adjust the speed.\u201dAfter confirming that all of those who will retrieve the Red Stone had gathered, the tallest mage from the Pearl Tower briefly explained how to handle the horses.\u201cIf you have to slow down and stop, you will need to do a long whistle. And if you have to run fast, you will need to whistle short and fast. The whistle doesn\u2019t have to be loud. They\u2019re designed to understand the sounds of the humans on their backs. Other than that, be careful not to put them near fire. They could melt or disappear.\u201dThose who were new to the Mist horses listened very carefully to the guide. Of course, Yuder knew even if he didn\u2019t listen, so he paid more attention to the faces of the crowd.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And one Kishiar\u2026\u2019The Peletta Knights were disciplined as if they had gathered their elite members, but their strength didn\u2019t seem to be that great. Well, of course, that was the case.\u2018I guess it\u2019s not about force, it\u2019s about experienced people.\u2019It didn\u2019t matter if the Peletta Knights were a little weak. The other members alone didn\u2019t even feel threatened.\u2018If anything happens, they won\u2019t have to draw their swords for Kishiar.\u2019They must have gone with this number of people in the past, too. And the combat power of Cavalry members selected at that time wouldn\u2019t be so low. Then why did Kishiar have to pull out the Divine Sword?What the hell did the small accident happen back then? Would there be the same problem this time?It was still unknown, but Yuder decided to prioritize the safety of Kishiar and the Red Stone as much as possible.\u2018If either of them gets hurt, there could be a big problem in the future.\u2019There was one more goal. Changing the fate of the Red Stone being sent to the Pearl Tower after recovery.This time, Yuder intended to prevent the Red Stone from going to the Pearl Tower.\u2018First, focus on the retrieval and then face Kishiar.\u2019He didn\u2019t like Kishiar, but at least he was on the same wavelength. Before Yuder\u2019s death, no one would understand or listen to him, but he wanted to believe that Kishiar would be different.Even if he didn\u2019t have to say everything, wouldn\u2019t it be possible to prevent the same future as before if he let them know that \u2018refinement\u2019 in the Pearl Tower was not a real refinement?\u2018If Kishiar doesn\u2019t understand what I say, I\u2019ll just sneak a peek.\u2019If he couldn\u2019t prevent the stone from being refined, he had to check first what form and properties the stone had. And he wouldn\u2019t mind stealing it if he had to.They climbed the horses guided by the Pearl Tower mages. Previously it was doubtful how the wind could be ridden because the shape wasn\u2019t precise. But if you actually touched the Mist horses, there was a tactile sensation on your hand even though it was unexpectedly invisible. It was over when you measured it well and sat on the horse kneeling.\u201cBe careful not to let go of the reins. If you feel like you\u2019re going to fall off the horse, it\u2019s okay as long as you hold the reins.\u201cIt feels weird.\u201d\u201cSame. I feel like I\u2019m sitting on an invisible lumpy slime.\u201dHinn and Finn siblings pressed their hips with frowns. The invisible horse\u2019s body repeatedly sank under the palm and returned.\u201cWhat if we use our power on this horse?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quite profane to say because this horse is more expensive than a cart full of gold.\u201dAt that time, Kishiar, mounting the biggest horse, said a word from behind the twins. His voice sounded like laughing, but it was enough to surprise the siblings.\u201cCommander-nim!\u201d\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d\u201cI really didn\u2019t mean to-\u201c\u201cCuriosity is a good virtue. The answer is, when you use your power more than the tolerable limit, the Mist horses would be destroyed and scattered.\u201dIt was a joke, but Kishiar\u2019s voice strangely felt clear as if it were real.The Eldore siblings were looking at each other\u2019s faces, hesitated for a moment, then began to speak.\u201cHave you tried it?\u201d\u201cHave you seen it yourself?\u201d\u201cOf course, it was when I was 11 years old. My father the previous emperor had to pay for the horse because the Tower Master was angered. I was punished with transcribing scriptures a hundred times.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone shut up at the casual title. It was an outspoken attitude, but everyone realized that the person in front of them was from the imperial family who continued the blood of the Sun God, and he was also a prince until a few years ago.Yuder was a little surprised in a different sense.\u2018It\u2019s a childhood story\u2026 Come to think of it, I\u2019ve never asked or heard of it myself.\u201dYuder was one of the people who had been with Kishiar the most before his death.He recalled that he had to meet Kishiar voluntarily or unintentionally, but he\u2019d never talked to him like this before.He thought so, back then, but it really was a stark relationship.So stark that he didn\u2019t even know that his face would remain on his mind for so long after everything.\u201cWho\u2019s in the front most among those who are leaving?\u201dThe mage of the Pearl Tower, who confirmed that everyone was on the horse, asked who would ride the horse at the front.\u201cThese Mist horses have been trained to run along the path when the one holding the particular seat got ahead. Usually, it\u2019s not necessary for our mages who are used to using them, but I prepared it because many people said it was their first time riding it. I\u2019ll give this stone to the person standing at the front.\u201dThe stone they took out was a black mana crystal the size of a finger. One of Peletta\u2019s knights raised his hand and drove his horse closer as he held high the crystal woven into a bracelet so that it wouldn\u2019t easily be dropped.\u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019ll be the guide at the front.\u201d\u201cAlright. Take this, and don\u2019t take it off when you\u2019re on the horse.\u201dThe Peletta knight wore the bracelet from the mage and raised his hand a few times. He looked down and judged whether it was uncomfortable or not.As he nodded as if he\u2019d decided it would be okay, Nathan, who was watching everything from not far away, came close to Kishiar\u2019s horse.\u201cPlease have a safe trip, Duke-nim.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with that stiff face? As if I wouldn\u2019t make it back safely.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNathan had a blank expression. There was no such thing as a laugh, but Kishiar smiled with his red eyes. Yuder watched as Kishiar bent down with the reins of his horse and tapped his aide on the shoulder.\u201cI know. I\u2019ll leave it to you until I get back.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes\u201d\u2018What does he know?\u2019As soon as a short question crossed Yuder\u2019s mind, Kishiar straightened his body and turned his head. His gaze stopped on Yuder\u2019s face as he looked through the group of ten people riding on Mist horses.\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dTwo Peletta knights stood at the forefront of the guiding role, with Kishiar and the Cavalry in the middle. The rear was also three Peletta knights.\u2018Actually, it is the knights that should be protected\u2026\u2019Yuder pulled the reins with a quaint irony. With a short whistle, the Mist horse that Yuder rode slowly began to shake and move.If they escaped to the west of the Imperial Knights\u2019 site, they could pass directly out of the unauthorized wall. The party headed toward it, took a full-fledged direction, and ran southward.The golden sun cast a long shadow over the plains where eleven Mist horses ran to their heart\u2019s content. The journey to the Airic Mountains to retrieve the Red Stone began.***The Mists were able to run more than three times faster than ordinary horses, characterized by less burden on the body even if it ran for a long time due to its unique touch.The Cavalry members riding the Mists for the first time were all surprised by the fact ad talked about the time they decided to take a break for dinner.\u201cIt\u2019s so weird. Why doesn\u2019t my butt hurt when I\u2019m on a horse?\u201d\u201cMy back doesn\u2019t hurt either.\u201dGakane stepped in between the Eldore siblings and patted their backs as they talked.\u201cBecause the ones who usually use them are mages. Mages are infamous for being weak in physical strength and in transportation. So, when they made Mists, they improved it as much as they could to make up for the shortcomings.\u201d\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d\u201cWhen I first rode the horse, I asked the Pearl Tower mage who came to help me. Actually, I really wanted to ride this horse before.\u201dListening to that, Yuder recalled the faces of mages who were slowly avoiding him rather than coming to help him when he was about to mount the horse.But in a short time, Gakane had a detailed conversation with a mage from the famous Pearl Tower, which, if true, was unusual.Yuder, who thought that Gakane\u2019s talent might be in the speaking field, also thought it was a waste that such a person would easily disappear into death from an accident a few months later.\u2018As expected, he needs to be saved.\u2019\u201cEveryone here? The meal is ready.\u201dThe Peletta knights had taken out a pot from afar and cooked skillfully, waving at the Cavalry members. Unlike the members who didn\u2019t bring anything but a few clothes, the Peletta knights had enough luggage to have two bags each, divided on each side of the horse.He wondered what it was all about and it was all necessary to make ends meet.The knights skillfully made a fire in the field without the Cavalry members\u2019 help and boiled soup by hanging a pot on a portable pot rack made by breaking branches.Whenever there was a constant stream of condiments, dried beef jerky, and dried bread in their luggage, Yuder admired their viability.\u201cBy the way, the Duke said he\u2019d go to the nearby stream for a while, but he hasn\u2019t returned. Would anyone mind bringing him back?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yuder stood up, sighing small at the gazes that looked at him as if it were his responsibility before he agreed to it.\u2018Yes, it would be too much for anyone to personally go to see a high-ranking person. I get it.\u2019Even Yuder, who used to be a deputy commander assisting Kishiar and later live in the high position for several years, was not in a situation he wanted to be in, so wouldn\u2019t others be embarrassed?Still, he decided to think that it would be better for him to move for those who were younger and had a better future after about 10 years.\u201c\u2026 Commander-nim.\u201dAs the knights said, Kishiar stood next to a tree not far from the dining area with a Misty horse\u2019s reins tied to it. Even though he was standing in a place where darkness had fallen, he looked strangely bright.\u2018I think he used to say it was some kind of pedigree effect, but\u2026 I don\u2019t remember exactly.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to have dinner.\u201d\u201cOh, so that\u2019s what happened.\u201dKishiar looked back.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you came here alone. You\u2019re the most trusted of all ten of them.\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dHe must be quickly realized that there would be no one like Yuder when putting off a hassle because they were scared. That man quickly found out who gave them room to hide behind his back.Yuder walked a few steps in front of Kishiar without looking back. Since it was polite to walk in front of or behind the upper person, he thought it would be better to walk in front of Kishiar so that his face couldn\u2019t be seen.\u201cWhen I called your name earlier.\u201dHowever, when words were heard from behind his back, his effort was useless. Yuder stopped walking in silence.\u201cYou looked so surprised. Did you really not expect it? I mean, I was going to nominate you in the first place.\u201c\u2026My ability is not to read the future.\u201dHe just remembered what happened in the future. But this time, everything that happened had changed. How could he not be surprised?Even so, he didn\u2019t know that Kishiar would look at him so carefully and talk to him when they were alone.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. But it was quite refreshing to see such a look for the first time. It was fun.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see. Can I just say I\u2019m glad you had fun?\u201dYuder\u2019s voice was as cold as ever. There was no one here who didn\u2019t know that the tone was polite but the meaning of it was the opposite.\u201cHahaha.\u201dKishiar laughed.\u201cSo, are you unhappy about following me? If you want to go back, you can go back now.\u201d\u201cI must do what I\u2019m obliged to do.\u201dYuder answered as succinctly as he could. Whether he liked Kishiar or not, he would never go back from here. He had a goal of protecting Kishiar and the Red Stone with his own hands.\u201cHow fearless. It\u2019s interesting.\u201dYuder turned around without answering and started walking toward the site again.\u201cYuder Aile.\u201d\u201cI like you. Do you want to be more open-minded and close to me?\u201dYuder stopped walking for the second time. When he looked back, he saw a smile that he couldn\u2019t understand.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019Had he been like this before? No. He\u2019d never been on a mission like this before, so it was impossible to compare. Yuder looked at that man\u2019s face in confusion and began to speak.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve been trying to treat you with respect enough, but if there\u2019s anything lacking\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, I\u2019m not talking about that right now.\u201d\u201cMy apologies. I\u2019ve been living alone in the mountains, so I\u2019m not very good at manners and socializing. If I misunderstood something\u2026\u201dAt heart, he tried to figure out what Kishiar\u2019s intentions were, and on the surface, he made excuses. Kishiar smiled again.\u201cYou don\u2019t like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, I get it.\u201d\u201cDuke-nim, this way!\u201dBefore Yuder could reply, a voice was heard shouting at them not far away. Yuder had to head back to where his party was, missing the opportunity to respond to Kishiar.***Two days later, until they finally reached the Airic Mountains where the Red Stone had fallen, Kishiar remained with his usual attitude.It meant that he did not speak personally, but only opened his mouth to the extent that he properly controlled between the Peletta Knights and the Cavalry.Unlike the Imperial Knights, Peletta knights did not show any hostility to the Cavalry. He didn\u2019t know what was on the inside, but it was an impeccable attitude.The Cavalry members seemed to think it was because their master, Kishiar la Orr, was also an Awakener, but Yuder\u2019s thoughts were slightly different.\u2018If that\u2019s the only case, they wouldn\u2019t be this neat.\u2019The Peletta Knights were the first group to be created after Kishiar la Orr received the duke title.Therefore, that was also the first place to be disbanded in Imperial Order after his death.\u2018They\u2019re following their master quite blindly.\u2019Even after three short days together, he could clearly see what they thought of Kishiar. For them, Duke Kishiar la Orr was a true \u201cmaster\u201d who received all the respect in one body beyond mere mastery.Why did those who felt this blind loyalty agree to disband without showing any action when Kishiar died in the past?\u2018Well, even though they\u2019re loyal now, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in about two years. This time, however, their master would not die and they wouldn\u2019t be disbanded.\u2019\u201cThere! I see a military flag stationed.\u201dAt that moment, a Peletta knight riding in the front yelled loudly. As he said, not far away, he saw a flag with a golden lion on a red background flying high in a tree. It was an imperial flag used by the Orr army.\u201cWe\u2019ll be there soon, so please slow down.\u201dThere was a long whistle that sounded around them. Yuder also whistled to slow down the Mist horse he was riding.The Mist horse was a great means of transportation. The speed and tireless stamina that could not be compared to a living horse were great, but the most amazing ability was that the rider\u2019s body was barely strained even though they ran without hoofing.The ability was represented by the fact that even though they ran for three days except for the time to eat and sleep, he could hardly feel tiredness on the group\u2019s faces.Perhaps if they had come by horse or carriage, they wouldn\u2019t have arrived. And they would have been exposed to indelible fatigue on their faces.The group slowly followed the guide to the entrance of the Imperial Army\u2019s temporary base camp at the bottom of the mountain range. Soon after, soldiers stood guard with large log walls and windows appeared.\u201cWho are you? Tell me where you came from!\u201d\u201cWe came under the order of His Majesty the Emperor. There is his brother, the Commander of the Cavalry, the master of Peletta Knights Brigade, His Highness Duke Kishiar la Orr.\u201dThe soldiers straightened up in unison with the loud voice of the knight.\u201cPlease wait a moment. I\u2019ve heard the news, and he shall be out to greet His Highness soon'\u201dYuder felt the Mist horse he rode purring and breathing coldly. Every time its mane shook like smoke and disappeared, it gave him goosebumps like cold ice. Since it was a creature not born naturally, Yuder\u2019s body naturally causes rejection. That was why he didn\u2019t use to ride this horse.\u2018It\u2019s not unbearable, but I feel uncomfortable.\u2019Yuder hoped that those coming to greet them would appear soon so he could get off the horse.\u201cYour Highness, welcome. I\u2019ve been waiting since I heard the order.\u201dFinally, people showed up from inside. Soon, a sharp-looking middle-aged man striding along with several armed soldiers raised his hand and saluted Kishiar in a gentle manner.\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t he the Confederate General, Count Gino Bordelli?\u201dYuder doubted his eyes for a moment. He knew that face. Everyone knew that the army sent by the Emperor was blocking the area and guarding it thoroughly after the fall of the Red Stone, but he never thought a General would be here as well. It was a fact that even Yuder in the past didn\u2019t know.Unlike the soldiers, Gino Bordelli did not wear armor. He only wore a golden lion brooch that the Emperor gave on the shoulders of his military uniform and then wrapped a blue cape, but the energy he exuded was heavier and more intense than anyone else in this seat.On the surface, he had an impression that he was only in his 40s, but Yuder knew that he was actually at least 20 years older than that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Gino Bordelli. He was in charge of this place at that time as well\u2026\u2019Imperial forces divided the great empire into two main sections, the South and the North. The southern and northern armies were generational rivals, and in many ways, the discipline and atmosphere were different, but they had one thing in common.The General, whether South or North, must be a Swordmaster. It was a component that allowed the empire to show off its strength among other nations, and those who took up the position of General became the core forces of the empire, becoming the Emperor\u2019s closest servant and sword.And Gino Bordelli, a Confederate General, was famous for being an upright fighter who had been serving as a General for nearly 40 years with little gossip or drama.Born as a Count and holding a sword even before he walked, he didn\u2019t join the Imperial Knights or any other famous knighthood like other nobles. Instead, he wandered around the world and devoted himself to sword training, becoming a swordmaster at the age of 30.Usually, after becoming a General, he would pursue more power without stopping there, but Bordelli didn\u2019t want anything and only worked hard to protect the empire. He was an idol of all swordsmen, and it didn\u2019t change after those Awakened by the Red Stone appeared.A general who only followed the Emperor\u2019s orders and strove to defend the empire silently like a huge rock. However, he retired a few years after Yuder became commander, and his subordinate succeeded him as General.\u2018I kept thinking he might have helped me back then.\u2019After identifying the signs of disaster, Yuder visited several people and asked for advice and support. Gino Bordelli was also one of those he was trying to find. But after retiring, he went away and his whereabouts couldn\u2019t be found.\u2018I didn\u2019t know him very well before. If possible, I wish we can make some connections from this.\u2019Retiring in a few years didn\u2019t change Gino Bordelli\u2019s status. He was still the most respected swordmaster on all continents. His words are worth more than a hundred of Yuder\u2019s words even when he was Commander.\u2018I wonder if he\u2019s been here for two years? Or is he here ahead of the retrieval operation? Either way, he moved because of the Emperor\u2019s orders.\u2019The Emperor sent his only brother and the Commander of the Cavalry, Kishiar, here to retrieve the Red Stone, and in addition to that, General Gino. What that meant was clear.\u2018The Emperor considers the stone to be a high priority.\u2019If true, it was quite a different direction from what Yuder had previously speculated.Because the only thing the Emperor did was to retrieve the Red Stone and leave it to the Pearl Tower mages and put it in the sanctuary with only a name, \u201cWorld Sphere.\u201dHe\u2019d even heard that the Emperor never visited until he died. So Yuder assumed that the current Emperor had only a slight curiosity about the stone.But what if that wasn\u2019t the case?\u201cLong time no see, Gino. I\u2019m glad you look healthy.\u201dKishiar took off the hood he was wearing and showed his face. Seeing the solid blonde hair and red eyes, the soldiers gasped in unison. It would be surprising to see that such a man had really come.Yuder, along with the rest of the group, got off the Mist horses. Kishiar was the first to greet them and shook hands lightly with General Gino.\u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve had a hard time keeping your guard.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t deserve your praise. Of course, I just did what I had to do.\u201d\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t have much to worry about except for the citizens nearby trying to sneak a peak.\u201dAs the two naturally entered the entrance of the barrier while talking, the soldiers widened the path in unison so that the rest of the group could enter.Yuder grabbed the reins of the Mist horse and followed suit, listening and trying not to miss Kishiar and the General\u2019s conversation.\u201cWhat\u2019s the total number of people here right now?\u201d\u201cAround 300 people.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more than I thought.\u201d\u201cWe had to watch the whole mountain, and the number got higher. It took more eyes over abilities.\u201d\u201cEyes over abilities?\u201dKishiar burst into a light laugh. General Gino was also a tall man like a swordmaster, but Kishiar was noticeably bigger than him.The sight of the two walking together seemed to be a scene of a different world. As much as the soldiers were amazed by the presence of the Duke and the General together, Yuder noticed that they were also interested in the Peletta Knights and the Cavalry members who followed them.The existence of the Cavalry had yet to be officially announced in the world. So very few people knew about it. It was understandable to think it was strange because men and women were wearing uniforms but were not knights, and had a different feeling than the Pearl Tower mages.But if nothing happened here, the soldiers would move on without knowing who they were.\u201cPlease come in.\u201dGeneral Gino led them to the building in the middle of the base. Originally, the small building, supposed to be a mountain cabin where hunters stayed, was fixed and extended in its own way and had a camouflaged appearance.\u201cWe\u2019ve got all the status reports here. You must\u2019ve had a hard time coming here, but I have the order to finish this work as soon as possible, so I shall report the situation here as soon as you unpack. Would that be alright?\u201dAfter listening to General Gino, Kishiar\u2019s eyes turned toward Peletta knights and the Cavalry.\u201cAre any of you tired?\u201d\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for us, sir.\u201dPeletta knights shouted out, and Gakane responded sternly. Kishiar nodded and turned his eyes back at General Gino.\u201cSo let\u2019s get started.\u201d\u201cAll right, will you be the only one to hear about the report and the Red Stone? Or\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll listen to it with the Cavalry. And Sir Brugg?\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThe knight in charge of guiding at the front stepped forward.\u201cWith you, too.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dWhen the four Peletta knights left, the rest of the group followed General Gino into a room further inside. The room had a map almost the size of a wall and several old chairs with no uniform design were scattered randomly around it.\u201cMy apologies. We don\u2019t have the facilities to greet such a high-ranking person. It won\u2019t break, so please sit.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t a chair enough to sit down?\u201dKishiar sat down with no sign of displeasure, pulling a chair close by.\u201cEveryone, sit down.\u201dAt his words, Hinn and Finn were the first to sit quickly, followed by others carefully putting their hips together in a clumsy manner. Yuder sat in the backmost chair where he could see everyone in the room.T/N: Essentially, his back was against the back wall and his front was facing everyone in the room. In real life this is common for security to do so they can survey any situation in the area no matter the time.General Gino approached the map after everyone sat down, pointing to a black dot in the middle of the map with his finger.\u201cThis is where we are right now. It\u2019s a mountain range in Airic across the middle of the Empire. Among them, it\u2019s exactly in the northwest.\u201dThe military map itself was different from the one used by the upper or nobles. What General Gino showed was part of the military map.The map, painted green to show that it was a mountain range and marked with contours according to height, was marked in detail enough to quickly tell the surrounding geography even if it was the first time he saw it.In addition, a simple picture of where troops scattered around the mountain range were stationed was displayed on top. The Cavalry, who had never seen a military map before, opened their eyes wide.\u201cThe Red Stone fell on this part two years ago. It\u2019s a mountain valley a few hours up from where we are.\u201dThe General moved his hand a little further down from where he pointed out his current position. There was a red dot on it.\u201cBut, you know, since it fell, the surroundings have been devastated, and it\u2019s become a place where no one can access.\u201dA place where no one could access\u00a0recklessly. Yuder read a double meaning in the words. It might be a place where no one could access because the army was guarding it, but it might also mean that the power of Red Stone made it difficult for the troops to access.Yuder recalled a memory related to the Red Stone that he had seen a short time before. Before returning back in time, Kishiar, who just returned from the Red Stone Retrieval Mission, was seen from a distance from the other members.He didn\u2019t remember the condition of the Cavalry he took at the time, but he remembered no one was noticeable, so it was probably enough for everyone to walk on their own.Back then, Kishiar was holding the Red Stone with a rare look on his face. To be exact, it would be correct to say that the stone he was carrying was a bundle wrapped in several layers of thick cloth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was just a memory passing by for a moment, but Yuder felt very strange.Even though the stone was thickly wrapped in cloth, he clearly felt that there was something inside it with great power. Just being in the same area, the air filling the space became heavy creating an almost drowning feeling. The intense energy filled the entire site.Yuder wasn\u2019t the only one who felt that way. All the Cavalry members who were there at the time said in unison that they felt strange energy that could not be explained in words.The next day, Kishiar appeared with a red silk cushion in a box carved from a transparent stone, and the Red Stone on top of it. It seemed to be wrapped like that to show to the Emperor.Just before Kishiar got on the wagon, Yuder saw the Red Stone in the box through the window of his room. The stone was not actually red and was smaller than expected.If he didn\u2019t know in advance that it was Red Stone, he wouldn\u2019t know what it was on the surface. It was such an ordinary-looking stone with a strange energy.Then the stone didn\u2019t return to the Cavalry but was instead immediately headed to the Pearl Tower, making it the last time Yuder saw the intact red stone in his previous life.\u201cHave you ever tried to approach?\u201dGeneral Gino replied briefly, \u201cYes,\u201d to Kishiar\u2019s question.\u201cThe soldiers didn\u2019t even dare to approach. Those skilled enough to start building up an oracle could get to where they could see it, and I saw it right in front of me.\u201d\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\u201cIt was a very strange thing. It\u2019s hard to judge exactly, but maybe it\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t belong to this world. The priests of the Sun God said it was different from God\u2019s energy, and the mages of the Pearl Tower said it was difficult to access at all. so no one came to see it.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m afraid if Your Highness touched it yourself, you would be in danger.\u201dGeneral Gino uttered words of concern to Kishiar, who came all the way here.\u201cSome of the soldiers forced to approach the stone threw up blood. It\u2019s a commodity with unknown energy. It has the power to make a difference on the continent, but if it hurts your precious body, is it really worth the trouble?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty believed that I\u2019m the most appropriate person to bring it to him without harm. Are you, General, concerned about what His Majesty believes?\u201d\u201cI-\u201dGeneral Gino, who suddenly became a person who could not believe what the Duke was saying, immediately opened his mouth, and Kishiar reached out and stopped him.\u201cI trust your eyes that have watched over me since I was a child. I\u2019m the only one in the world who can move without being defeated by that stone.\u201dGeneral Gino\u2019s face might seem like a middle age man, but his actual age wasn\u2019t strange to have a grandson. So, as Kishiar said, he would have seen him since childhood.General Gino closed his eyes and sighed deeply when he heard Kishiar.\u201cHow could I even manage to stop you?\u201d\u201cHaha. That\u2019s what I always say then managed to stop you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the mind of an old servant who knows it\u2019s no use, but eventually worries.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not that out of it to be defeated by a stone.\u201dKishiar stood up from his seat after saying so. As everyone\u2019s eyes were on him, Kishiar smiled and opened his mouth.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s all write a secret pledge before we leave.\u201dThe Cavalry members looked dumbfounded, but Yuder thought it had come. Not only this mission, but most of the missions that the Cavalry would handle in the future were absolutely in need of secrecy. Therefore, it was hard to count how many times Yuder also wrote a pledge before going on a mission.\u201cIt\u2019s a magical pledge that many knights and mages use before they go on important missions. After you write down your vows and sign them, the mana in the paper intertwines each other\u2019s hearts.\u201dKishiar continued, holding up a seemingly plain piece of paper.\u201cWhat is written this time is simple. Prohibit speaking without permission to anyone other than those who have performed this mission with regard to everything seen, heard, and experienced during this mission. In case of a breach, the magic in this pledge will tighten the heart, making it impossible to breathe. I think people here can keep this much a secret, but just in case. Those who are not confident may step down from here. I\u2019ll send you back without saying anything.\u201dThe word \u2018impossible to breathe\u2019, actually meant \u2018death\u2019. Yuder was the first to move toward the pledge taken out of his arms by Kishiar while everyone could not move easily. There was no hesitation at all.\u201cI will take it first.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dUp close, it was a pledge made by the Pearl Tower. In other words, it was the most reliable and powerful pledge anywhere else on the continent.He didn\u2019t need any other supplies to pledge. If he read the contents and put a finger on the pledge, the mana that stretched out from the paper would naturally wrap around one\u2019s body, and it all ended in an instant.When Yuder finished his pledge casually and stepped back, Gakane, who had a hard look on his face, gulped down the words with a determined face and followed suit.\u201cThe next will be me.\u201dAs if feeling relieved when he confirmed that it was a small process, the others also took their fingers one by one. Finally, General Gino stamped his finger with an expressionless face, and Kishiar rolled up the pledge and put it back in his arms.\u201cThen we will go back to rest and leave early tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll show you where to stay.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to hear more from General. We don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll see each other again.\u201dFor the first time, a smile appeared on the stiff General\u2019s face as he heard Kishiar\u2019s words.\u201cWhile waiting for your arrival, I happen to have a good drink in this area. I shall take show it to you on our way.\u201dKishiar was guided by General Gino and left for his quarters. The Peletta Knights and Cavalry members followed a young soldier who appeared under the direction of the General to a small town near the base.\u201cFollow me, please.\u201d\u2018He looks familiar.\u2019Yuder was lost in thought as he looked at the back of the guiding young soldier. He felt like he had seen him somewhere even though the man wasn\u2019t a Cavalry member. Had he ever known anyone he\u2019d ever encountered in a place like this?If he heard the name, he might remember it, but it was 11 years ago from the time he remembered. It could have been some sort of illusion.\u2018Let\u2019s keep a watch for now. If I keep looking at it, I might remember.\u2019The village, which is only about 10 minutes away, was incredibly lively to be in such a mountain range.Others seemed surprised, but Yuder didn\u2019t find it difficult to guess why.\u2018Maybe it was an ordinary village where they lived by gathering and hunting.\u2019The Airic Mountains were very wide enough to match the nickname of the continent\u2019s spine. This village was also a long way from where Yuder originally lived.But it was all human beings living there, right? Villages located in the mountains had a small number of residents due to their characteristics, and there was little contact with the lord.However, the situation might have changed since the Red Stone fell nearly two years ago, attracting a large number of soldiers.The military is by no means a free movement. Many of them stayed in one place for as long as two years without fighting or doing any special activities. Providing a place for them to eat, drink, and stay, this small village would have quickly become a place full of money and energy.\u2018Of course, after the Red Stone is retrieved by Kishiar, the glory will soon be lost.\u2019Once the Red Stone was retrieved, there was no reason for the soldiers to stay here anymore. Therefore, the vitality of this village was not so pleasant in Yuder\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhy are there so many people here?\u201d\u201cMost of them are soldiers resting. Instead of taking turns performing tough surveillance missions scattered across the wide mountain ranges, we can relax here while drinking and hanging out with others. General Gino\u2019s consideration.\u201dThe soldier guiding answered Kana\u2019s question with the same answer as Yuder\u2019s guess.\u201cWhat is it, Sunz, where are you going with strangers?\u201dAt that time, those sitting at an outdoor table and drinking loudly near the young soldier waved their hands and pretended to know.The young soldier sneaked off his solemn look like a soldier he had just made and looked back at those who had been talking to him with a youthful smile of that age.\u201cI\u2019m on a mission. I have to show the General\u2019s guests to their quarters.\u201d\u201cOkay, come here when you\u2019re done. Sunz, It\u2019s not as fun playing cards without you playing too.\u201d\u201cWe can talk about that later, not here.\u201dFunny thing was that soldiers in plain clothes laughed out loud drunk. The young soldier apologized to Yuder and his party with a slightly awkward look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cMy apologies. We\u2019ve spent two years here doing nothing but patrol duty, and they\u2019re all a little lax and drunk, so please understand.\u201dThere were many commoners within the Cavalry familiar with such scenery, so they said nothing. The same was true of Yuder. But it was a bit surprising that the Peletta knight, who he thought might say something, only nodded without coughing.Yuder thought he was on the side of being unbiased along with his master, Kishiar, but maybe there was something more to them.\u2018By the way, that soldier\u2019s name is Sunz. Sunz.\u2026 Sunz is it?\u2019Yuder tried to recall someone by the name of Sunz, or by his last name. But he still didn\u2019t remember very well.Around the time he thought he was getting somewhere, Sunz stopped walking in front of a building located in a deserted place.\u201cThis is the accommodation we have for you. It\u2019s small, but most of the buildings here are like that. You shouldn\u2019t have a big problem sleeping for a few days.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dGakane thanked him on behalf of everyone.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Then excuse me, but\u2026 Was that the Duke of Peletta who went with you earlier?\u201dSunz had been curious about it since a while ago, but he asked carefully with a clear expression that he couldn\u2019t ask.\u201cYes.\u201dSunz opened his eyes wide and opened his mouth when the person who played the role of a guide in the Peletta Knights simply answered back.\u201cAs expected! My goodness, I never thought I\u2019d see a man who continued the blood of the Sun God in my life. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Then, are you\u2026 Are you the Peletta Knights that follow him?\u201dSunz couldn\u2019t erase his excited gaze over his charred cheeks. He hung busily between the Peletta Knights and the Cavalry.Yuder saw the Peletta Knights\u2019 guide look back at him with a troubled face.\u00a0\u2018What should I say?\u2019\u00a0He looked as if he wanted to ask that.Seemed that it was hard to think about what to say to others about the existence of the yet-unknown Cavalry, but what was there to think of as difficult?Anyway, after this operation, the existence of the Cavalry would be known to the world. Even now, General Gino and other high-ranking people would know they were here, so there was no reason to hesitate. Yuder began to speak quietly.\u201cThe five of them here are Knights of Peletta. And we\u2019re members of the Cavalry.\u201d\u201cYuder.\u201dGakane\u2019s eyes also raised concerns and boundaries over whether it would be okay to say so easily. But Yuder was nonchalant.\u201cCavalry\u2026 Isn\u2019t that where the Emperor said to be recruiting? Recruiting people who gained strength from the Red Stone. So that was true?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you so soon.\u201dSunz\u2019s expression showed no reluctance to the Cavalry. He just looked at Yuder with a look of pure wonder.\u201cOh, you\u2019d better be careful when you\u2019re walking around the village.\u201d\u2018Village? Why?\u2019Sunz scratched his head and smiled clumsily as the look on Yuder\u2019s face showed up.\u201cIn that place, there is\u2026 a lot of resting soldiers who have abilities like you. One of them is the one you saw earlier.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dWhen Eldore siblings looked at him with sparkling eyes, Sunz replied obediently, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not of great abilities, but they\u2019ve never seen anyone other than us, so everyone will be noisy if they know who you are. There are a lot of guys in the Confederate Army who are crazy about fighting.\u201d\u201cEven so\u2026 Why didn\u2019t people with abilities apply for the Cavalry test?\u201dKanna asked in a puzzled voice.\u201cI don\u2019t think there was a rule that soldiers weren\u2019t allowed to take tests\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dSunz also agreed with Kanna.\u201cBut just because there are no rules, it\u2019s hard to run away. There was no guarantee of passing, and we are satisfied with our current life. I thought there would be a lot of people like us.\u201d\u2018Wait.\u2019Yuder felt something in Sunz words. Wouldn\u2019t the \u2018us\u2019 that he said include him, too?\u201cAre you by any chance one of them?\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dSunz nodded slowly as if he had belatedly noticed his slip of the tongue. Yuder\u2019s sense which had been trained for a long time was good at identifying the strong around him, but it didn\u2019t mean that he was as accurate as an Awakener with magic or detection ability.He didn\u2019t think Sunz was an Awakener because he didn\u2019t see any sign of a strong person in him. Hinn, who had a curious look on her face, stepped up first before Yuder asked what ability he had.\u201cWhat kind of ability do you have?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing. Just a little\u2026 I can see what\u2019s behind the cover. It\u2019s the ability to play card games.\u201d\u2018Vision ability user?\u2019It was only at that moment that Yuder realized where he saw the man named Sunz.\u2018Yes, Sunz\u2026 Sunz\u2026 there was that.\u2019As Sunz said, there were certainly people with abilities already Awakened from their jobs. Among those not taking that direction even though they had enough ability to join the Cavalry, the largest number were mostly in the army.Long ago, by the time General Bordelli retired, they had gathered on their own to create a new unit in the military. It was a man named Sunz in charge of that unit.It was a secret creation. The founding ceremony was not held properly, so Yuder barely heard the information from sources in the military, but he remembered the name properly.He had no choice but to remember him because it was Yuder himself, the commander of the Cavalry, who felt the most displeased and surprised at the news of the unit\u2019s creation.\u2018If I remember correctly, the exact name was Sunz Messial.\u2019The special forces, made up of men of abilities in the military, remained silent as if they hadn\u2019t existed since their foundation until just before Yuder\u2019s death.Therefore, Yuder thought they weren\u2019t a threat to the Cavalry and were created to separate them from ordinary soldiers in the military. That was why he was displeased but focused on what he was supposed to do.When Yuder was caught before he died and imprisoned, he first learned that maybe it was his illusion.The soldiers who had captured, tortured, and kept an eye on Yuder were not regular soldiers. Although his mana core was destroyed and he was no longer able to use his abilities or identify other Awakeners, it was not ordinary people who kept a watch on him, who was previously the Cavalry Commander.Those who caught him were thoroughly wary of whether he would escape or regain at least one piece of power until the moment he died.Even when he was trapped unconscious by torture, Yuder desperately opened his ears and tried to hear what others said. It was the name of the Special Force that he picked up back then.The Emperor no longer trusted the Cavalry. The only thing he acted like a hand was the Special Forces. For this \u2018big hunt\u2019, they would receive greater rewards, guarantees of honor, and status.When he heard such a story secretly coming and going among the soldiers in a joyful voice, all of Yuder\u2019s hopes were gone. How bitter he was to have a strong hunch that there would be no more way for him to survive.Of course, what they meant by the \u2018big hunt\u2019 was Yudrain Aile.He didn\u2019t know who, when, or for what purpose the Special Force department he thought was nothing was created. He didn\u2019t even know where the information coming into him was intercepted.But now, it was a different story if he\u2019d met the Special Force representative that he knew.The Special Force had yet to be established, and their representative was stuck in the corner of Airic Mountains as an ordinary soldier. Now, and in this state, it was easy enough to get rid of him in advance. Kill Sunz and the future would be different!Yuder momentarily tried to boost his power to kill the man in front of him. But when the ungreedy black eyes looked at him, the power he had lifted was momentarily shaken and scattered.\u201c\u2026 Did I say anything strange?\u201d\u201cYuder, what\u2019s wrong? You look stiff.\u201dNext to the bewildered Sunz, Gakane tapped his shoulder and talked low.Only then did Yuder sigh, feeling the rest of his murderous intent completely disappear.\u2018\u2026 What the hell am I thinking.\u2019In his life, he had killed many people and ended up kneeling down on the guillotine. Even though he was told that he was a stubborn and dirty devil by his subordinates, he still had some principles he had set for himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIf not ordered by the Emperor, do not use force to kill someone, but if possible, save them and get them to surrender. Do not punish those who have not yet sinned without proof. As long as you are the Commander of the Cavalry, you will always put the Cavalry and Empire before your own safety.A person with greater power than others could cause a great storm in other people\u2019s lives just by moving a finger, so you should not move recklessly without such clear standards.It\u2019s easy to kill and beat someone at will, but if you live like that, you\u2019ll soon have a big problem that won\u2019t be able to be solved by strength alone.Judge more rationally than anyone else, but overwhelm when you have to use your powers.It was Kishiar la Orr, currently drinking with General Gino, that put that fact thoroughly in Yuder\u2019s head.\u2018\u2026 It\u2019s easy to kill Sunz now. But will that really change the future of Special Force?\u2019Yuder took a deep breath and thought rationally.\u2018The representative can be just anyone else. But if I keep Sunz alive\u2026 Through him, we can understand the trends of Awakeners in the military, and we can connect much more closely even if there is for Special Force in the future.\u2019It was much better to think rationally about making a connection by keeping him alive. After repeating it so many times, his mind became calm. Yuder looked around with a more composed look.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Perspective is a rare skill that our Cavalry doesn\u2019t have. So I was just surprised.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dSunz tilted his head in relief and smiled.\u201cIf there are any other people here besides you, would you mind introducing them to me?\u201d\u201cBut not everyone is available. Some of them are on duty\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough to tell me about the people resting in the village right now. You don\u2019t have to worry, it\u2019s just personal curiosity.\u201dYuder also smiled to make him feel comfortable. Sunz nodded without much doubt.\u201cI don\u2019t mind. After I show you to the dorm, my work is over, and you\u2019ll have free time. If you want to meet other Awakeners in our military, please unpack and come with me.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAnyway, the Red Stone Retrieval Operation was led by Kishiar, so there was nothing for Yuder to care about. It was fortunate that boring things disappeared thanks to the discovery of an unexpected thing here.Yuder arrived at the accommodation under Sun\u2019s guide, casually overlooking the eyes of the others.\u201cThis is where you will stay. Once you\u2019ve unpacked, you\u2019re free to wander around.\u201dThere were a total of two accommodation buildings for them. One was to be used by the Peletta Knights, and the other was to be used by the Cavalry.However, since the building was so small that there were only two bedrooms, there was a need to divide the members before unpacking.\u201cSorry, is there any second-gender Awakener?\u201dHinn stepped up and looked back at the rest of the unit.\u201cFinn and I are both non-manifested Awakeners.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a non-manifested Awakener, too.\u201dAfter Kanna answered, she turned her eyes to Yuder. Yuder nodded lightly, meaning he was the same. Then naturally all that remained was Gakane. He scratched his head with a more bewildered look at the four pairs of eyes looking at him.\u201cI\u2019m an Alpha Awakener.\u201d\u201cReally? Then we can divide it based on first gender. Kanna and I will use a room. Alright?\u201dHinn took Kanna\u2019s hand and entered the quarters before she could hear the answer. Naturally, the remaining room was occupied by three men.\u2018Gakane was an Alpha Awakener.\u2019As Yuder entered the room, he brooded over the new information he had learned. It was surprising that aside from Gakane, there was no word when people around him talked about the second gender.\u2018I\u2019m glad I know now. Maybe later I will manifest the same as before.\u2019Yuder hadn\u2019t forgotten the memories of his manifestation as an Omega. It was one of the most intense experiences of his life, so he couldn\u2019t forget it.The manifestation of the second gender itself was tolerable, though painful. Most importantly, there should be no Awakeners of an opposing second gender around during the manifestation.It didn\u2019t matter until now because it wasn\u2019t properly known and there were just a few Awakeners gathered nearby, but a lot had changed since the formation of a huge group of Awakeners called the Cavalry.To date, those who had manifested a second gender usually would have Awakened their abilities. However, it wasn\u2019t until a long time after Awakening abilities that one could manifest a second gender. The problem mainly arose at that time.Yuder was also one of the Awakeners who suddenly manifested after joining the Cavalry and went through an unexpected incident because he didn\u2019t know the truth properly. So he knew well enough about what problems would arise.\u2018\u2026 I\u2019m going to deliver this to Kishiar in advance, along with the story of military Awakeners.\u2019So far, he hadn\u2019t seen a member suffering damage from related matters since joining the unit. However, it was necessary to come up with alternatives in advance because they didn\u2019t know what would happen in the future.If Kishiar asked where he knew about it, he would have to exaggerate. Even if he was suspected, he needed to let him know this in advance.While Yuder went into the room with that thought and put down his bag, Finn left the room, saying he would find the bathroom.Gakane threw off his uniform coat and laid on the bed, breathing out a long sigh, and began to speak.\u201cYuder, why do you want to go see Awakeners all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cI just got interested.\u201d\u201cEven so, you didn\u2019t care much about your fellow Cavalry members?\u201dYuder couldn\u2019t believe he suddenly said something that caught him off guard. He smiled in vain, looking at Gakane.\u201cBecause I already know you guys. They are different.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d\u201cThink about it, there are a lot of people in the military who are similar to us and have unknown abilities.\u201dAt Yuder\u2019s words, Gakane nodded with a boyish look.\u201cThen what? They\u2019re not the only ones who didn\u2019t apply for the Cavalry on purpose, even with their abilities.\u201d\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the army here, it wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201dThere were certainly Awakeners among the mages of the Pearl Tower, the Imperial Court Mages, and the Imperial Knights. They just hadn\u2019t shown themselves.But they were absolutely small in number, and the military wasn\u2019t. At least the Southern army, led by General Gino, boasted a huge number of Awakeners.Even if only some of them were awakened, they would be second only to the Cavalry.\u201cHow long will they be able to stay as normal as they are now before they show their abilities to the Cavalry?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Do you mean that the high-ranking people in the military might try to create a second Cavalry?\u201dHe didn\u2019t say in detail, but with this hint alone, Gakane\u2019s eyes changed momentarily.\u201cIf it were you, what would you do?\u201d\u201cMaybe\u2026 No, I think so, too.\u201dGakane, who was at odds between signs of doubts and creepy realization for a moment, eventually got up from his seat and looked at Yuder with admiration.\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re trying to get as much information as you can. That\u2019s amazing! I never thought of it.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a good reason to be told that was great. If Gakane Bolunwald had endured all the storms at the top of a huge organization called the Cavalry for nearly a decade, he would\u2019ve thought of this first.\u2018And even if he were in the same situation, he wouldn\u2019t have thought of murder as I did just now.\u2019Gakane had a talent. In addition, he could\u2019ve been a much better leader than Yuder when he became the commander, considering that he had an easygoing personality, good appearance, and noble origins.If he were alive, Kishiar might not have chosen Yuder as the next commander. He didn\u2019t know what Gakane himself would think, but Yuder was pretty much appreciating his ability.In his old memories, he didn\u2019t expect himself to agree with others who were regretful that such a talent died so quickly. Yuder shook his head with a wry smile inside.\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is not something so great.\u201d\u201cYou two were friends before joining the Cavalry?\u201dThen Finn Eldore, who opened the door and returned, stepped in and talked to them. On the way here, Gakane seemed to have spoken to the Eldore siblings quite a bit, but Yuder seemed to rarely have a personal conversation with them as of yet.\u201cWe stayed in the same accommodation before the test. I got help from Yuder.\u201d\u201cI see. Is that how you got to know Kanna, too?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going out now.\u201dYuder took off his uniform coat like Gakane. Then, he was dressed in plain clothes that he\u2019d originally been wearing. Gakane looked anxiously at him as he opened the door.\u201cBe careful, Yuder, even if Sunz is around. We have to leave early tomorrow, so come back as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cWow. At that age, you sound like a parent with a child already?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201dYuder grinned and closed the door as he listened to Finn and Gakane\u2019s conversation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s go.\u201dWhen he talked to Sunz waiting outside the accommodation, Sunz shook his head and began to take a more comfortable step ahead.\u201cCome to think of it, what should I call you?\u201d\u201cJust call me Yuder.\u201d\u201cAlright, Yuder. Please call me Sunz, too.\u201dSunz grinned, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like being called a position because it\u2019s difficult.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been stuck here for two years, and it\u2019s nice to have a new friend.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been here since the Red Stone fell?\u201dYuder decided to ask questions while he was at it. Sunz gave a relaxed answer.\u201cSort of. Originally, I was in the Southern county of Gulcan under Airic. But after the incident, all the troops nearby were called up. After that, the numbers gradually increased, and General Gino came a few months ago.\u201d\u201cYou must have been bored.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s both true and false. I still use my Awakening abilities when I\u2019m bored these days. Time goes by so quickly when I work with the new Awakeners.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better this way than to work in the frontier and face a life threat on a war day,\u201d said Sunz.But Yuder found something unusual in his words.\u201cDoes that mean there is a constant Awakening among the soldiers?\u201d\u201cYes. Isn\u2019t that the case in other parts of the country?\u201dThat would be the case on a regional basis. But it wasn\u2019t as common as Sunz said.\u201c\u2026 Is it because they are close to where the Red Stone fell?\u2019Yuder thought it would be a pretty likely guess. After the fall of the Red Stone, Awakeners began to emerge throughout the continent, but the largest number came from the Orr Empire.And among them, the percentage of central regions was high. It was quite a significant proportion considering the stretch of Airic Mountains where Red Stone fell across the central region.Assuming that any force emanating from the stone existed, the soldiers who have stayed here for two years were the ones who have encountered it the most.It occurred to him that the constant Awakening here could be some proof of the stone\u2019s power.\u2018Did Kishiar from the previous life know this?\u2019Yuder quietly organized his thoughts and followed Sunz to the center of the village where resting soldiers were gathered.Unlike a small village, there were many tall people who were far from the villagers at a glance, where bars, restaurants, and shopping streets were well prepared.\u201cYo! Sunz, are you done?\u201d\u201cYeah, but where\u2019s the Emon over here?\u201dThose still playing cards at the outdoor table waved at Sunz. When Sunz asked back if the one he was looking for was there, someone answered loudly while pointing to a nearby building.\u201cHe\u2019s not having fun playing cards at the bar over there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what they say so. Let\u2019s go.\u201dYuder followed Sunz to the bar. It was still a time when the sun hadn\u2019t set, but the inside was quite crowded. Sunz explained that there was nothing to do, so they often gathered here and talked regardless of time.\u201cIt\u2019s a bar only by words, but they usually sell food and drinks during the day, too.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dAs he said, most of the men inside were drinking with bored faces. Not alcohol, but ordinary drinks.Some people inside saw Sunz and greeted him pretending to know him again. Sunz gave a brief explanation, accepting their greetings.\u201cHe awakened a year ago. His ability is to become strong like a bear. The one over there, too. Was it the ability to jump as high as the ramparts\u2026\u201dMost of those introduced in that way had the ability to strengthen the body. Yuder looked closely at their faces in case any of them had caught him in the past, but he could not find any.\u201cOh, and there\u2019s Emon. He\u2019s the one who works with me the most. He has a rough personality, but he\u2019s not a bad friend. Emon!\u201d\u201cOh, Sunz. you\u2019re finally here.\u201dThe man playing a dice game with others inside the bar raised his head. He was one of the men who pretended to know Sunz on his way to the accommodation.\u201cBut who\u2019s behind you? I\u2019ve never seen him before\u2026 A new recruit?\u201d\u201cNo. He\u2019s one of the people I dropped off.\u201dThe face of a man named Emon looked surprised as if he didn\u2019t think he was the same person as before because he wasn\u2019t wearing the uniform.\u201cOh, I see. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t recognize you. What brings you here\u2026.\u201d\u201cI asked him to look around here. I will go back after this.\u201dHe answered with no intention of making them uncomfortable, so it was okay to pay attention. Emon looked at Yuder with a strange look on his face for a moment, then he nodded and turned to the dice game.\u201cEmon\u2019s ability is\u2026\u201dWhen Sunz opened his mouth to explain Emon\u2019s ability, suddenly there was a loud noise from the back.The bar owner with a tray piled up as a mountain appeared. He put a tray on the table of those playing dice and smiled nicely.\u201cThis is the snack you ordered earlier. Eat while you do it. We also tore dry beef jerky for free.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the best!\u201d\u201cI like the sausage made by the owner here the best.\u201dThose playing dice cheered in unison and touched the tray. In an instant, the number of sausages was decreasing one after another, and the dice game took a short break.Yuder saw Emon stepping back a few steps, taking a small cloth bag out of his arms, and filling the dried scented cigar leaves in an old portable pipe. He didn\u2019t seem to have anyhow.After a while, a flinty little spark caught fire inside the pipe. A fragrant yet acrid smell spread through the smoke.\u201cThat\u2019s what Emon can do. He can make sparks. It\u2019s unusual among the Awakeners here.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201dEmon turned his head, showing that he heard the sound as Yuder nodded.\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not just here to look around, you\u2019re here to look at the Awakeners?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just like us. I was just explaining because he said he was curious.\u201dSunz answered first before Yuder came forward. Emon was fortunately not too curious about Yuder\u2019s identity.\u201cOh, really? Then you\u2019ve also seen that there aren\u2019t any men of great abilities here. I can only make enough flames to light a pipe.\u201dWhen Emon smirked and raised his index finger, a small spark burst on it. Yuder looked at it and opened his mouth.\u201cThe flame, can\u2019t you keep it?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t. It might\u2019ve been more useful if I could, but I\u2019m satisfied that I can enjoy the freedom to smoke cigars anytime without fire.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s still a good ability. If I work with Emon and climb the mountain for a patrol mission, at least I won\u2019t be cold all night for not being able to make a fire.\u201d\u201cYes, and thanks to you, I\u2019m glad we can avoid monsters and predators at night. That\u2019s about it.\u201dEmon smiled gently at Sun\u2019s praise and shrugged up and down again. Sunz burst into laughter.And Yuder\u2019s eyes as he watched them sank coldly.\u2018They don\u2019t have any idea of what they\u2019re capable of.\u2019This world currently didn\u2019t know any of the possibilities and characteristics of Awakeners\u2019 abilities. Even the Awakeners themselves didn\u2019t know.Awakeners\u2019 ability didn\u2019t stop but was given endless growth opportunities according to the development of the owner. Even if it was considered a small ability, it could be developed into a strong one depending on how the owner trained.\u2018In addition, most people have useful enough abilities even if they don\u2019t develop them.\u2019The soldiers introduced by Sunz usually had physical strength.The things to fight here were to deal with beasts and monsters that sometimes went the wrong way, so it would have been rarely used. But that ability was worth it when you go to the battlefield. Explosive growth was also expected.\u2018Sun\u2019s vision ability\u2026 So far, it seems to be visible regardless of obstacles or day and night, but that alone could have a great advantage in combat. The direction and potential for development are enormous.\u2019Emon\u2019s flame was similar. Now, the size was small and the duration was instantaneous, but instead, it had the advantage of creating flames immediately regardless of location whenever the owner wanted.There were also members of the Cavalry dealing with flame properties, but most had the disadvantage of taking a long time to recall or having poor retention.In that sense, Emon\u2019s flame was a very useful ability to engage in close combat against the enemy and attack them simultaneously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018After a few years, information on ability development will be known to the world. They will realize their potential.\u2019It would\u2019ve been better to be in the military. Then it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to give them a hint in advance and be well-liked.Yuder was a person who rose to the top by developing several levels of attribute-related abilities, which were otherwise said to be difficult to develop.There was even a saying that no one in the world would understand the mechanisms of Awakening as proficiently as the Commander of the Cavalry, Yuder Aile.The possibility of future development, which even those with abilities had not yet realized, seemed as easy to see in Yuder\u2019s eyes as the palm lines stretched out.He quickly finished his judgment and began to talk.\u201cIt seems to me that it\u2019s a very great ability, but it\u2019s too much of a self-imposed ability.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you just see it? It\u2019s a flame that can\u2019t even get a monster\u2019s fur burned. What\u2019s so great about that?\u201dEmon waved a smoke pipe and laughed like a man who heard a funny joke. Yuder opened his mouth without laughing a bit.\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019d feel if you tried to burn a monster\u2019s fur. But what if you put a spark in the eyeballs or mouth while fighting a monster?\u201dThe pipe of Emon, which was shaking lightly, stopped. Sunz\u2019s light smile disappeared for a moment.\u201cYour flame is as short and strong as a flint. It\u2019s like a big fire, and you don\u2019t have to worry about the rest, you can keep practicing if you need to.\u201dYuder continued, looking them in the face.\u201cIf you get used to calling out more, faster, like hitting flint many times, you can pop dozens and hundreds at the same time. And yet, do you still feel your abilities are insignificant?\u201d\u201c\u2026 That idea\u2026 I\u2019ve never done it before.\u201d Emon muttered with a puzzled look.\u201cIf you haven\u2019t, try it. I\u2019m sure that much will be possible soon. And Sunz.\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201dSunz, who was watching what Yuder was doing to Emon, instinctively answered with his mouth wide open. It was the same attitude when he met his superiors, but none of the three felt strange there.\u201cIt\u2019s a great reconnaissance ability to locate an enemy in the dark. Train yourself to close your eyes and feel beyond. As your senses become more sensitive, your ability will develop gradually. You can increase the distance that you can see, or you can only see what you want.\u201d\u201cClose my eyes\u2026 and train?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t understand what I mean, close your eyes now.\u201dYuder\u2019s words contained persuasive power that he had learned from serving as a commander for a long time. Sunz somehow closed his eyes, feeling as if he were listening to orders.\u201cDo you see anything?\u201d\u201cAh, no. Nothing right now\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen you use your abilities, do you usually have to concentrate a lot?\u201d\u201cYes. How could you\u2026?\u201dIt was obvious, even ordinary people who didn\u2019t have the ability to see things needed to concentrate their minds to look into them. If you had the ability to do it yourself, you\u2019d need more concentration.Yuder had seen a lot of such people.\u201cYou\u2019d better start by practicing so that you can focus right away when you need to. Anyway, now I\u2019m going to spread some fingers in front of your face. Focus and guess how many I\u2019m holding up.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Excuse me? Like, right now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already done it. How many do you feel?\u201d\u201cH- hold on.\u201dWithout giving Sunz time to think, Yuder straightened three fingers in front of his face.Sunz pursed his lips and frowned. There was a very feeble feeling around him.\u201cGuess until I count down from five. 5, 4, 3.\u201d\u201cHang on. I\u2019m still\u2026\u201d\u201c2, 1. How many?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No. Was it 3?\u201dSunz murmured with a hint of desperation. But that was the answer. Yuder smirked as he watched Emon open his eyes wide next to him.\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201dSunz opened his eyes and looked puzzled at the three fingers in front of him.\u201cYou got it right.\u201d\u201cBut I was in such a hurry\u2026 It\u2019s just a coincidence.\u201d\u201cNo, you got it right.\u201dYuder responded with all his might.\u201cThe more you doubt yourself, the harder it is to function. Be confident.\u201d\u201cBoth of you, what I just said might sound strange. But I\u2019ve seen people with these abilities over and over again, and I\u2019m still with them. Please take my word for it.\u201dAt Yuder\u2019s words, the two men looked at each other with strange expressions. There was no indication of what to think of this strange conversation that took place so suddenly.\u2018They must be surprised and confused. But on top of that, they have to change their perception of their abilities.\u2019\u00a0Yuder started to speak while looking back at their faces.\u201cIt\u2019s not a useless ability. I can bet anything that high-ranking people will soon need your ability.\u201d\u201cHigh-ranking people? No one\u2019s been looking for us for two years now.\u201d Emon muttered, shaking off the scented grass ash piled up in the pipe.\u201cWe are ordinary soldiers. Aren\u2019t there countless people in the Orr Empire with this level of ability? The one recruited by the Emperor this time\u2026 Like the Cavalry or something.\u201d\u201cYou know that. Why do you think they recruited the Cavalry? Because it was necessary.\u201dIt was said that no one had looked for them in two years, but in other words, it was only two years. The past two years, when there was no Cavalry, were too much for the world to be wary of and adapt to the emergence of new people with new abilities. And from now on, when the adaptation was over, a new world unfolded. Now that was a world that only Yuder knew.\u201cThe world still doesn\u2019t know the value of abilities. But it will be different soon. It\u2019s going to be different when a lot of people realize the value.\u201d\u201cDo you really think so?\u201dSunz tilted his head and asked. So far, there has been an air of doubt.\u2018I might seem rather like an instigator if I say yes immediately.\u2019Yuder just smiled quietly.\u201c\u2026 If you don\u2019t know the power you have, you won\u2019t be able to use it properly even when you really need it. Be aware of the extent of your power until someone who needs it appears, and do not underestimate its value. If you think lightly of your ability, others will think even less of it.\u201dAt the same time, Sunz and Emon were lost in deep thought by Yuder\u2019s words. It would\u2019ve been hard to understand immediately because they were people who learned that it was only right to follow the General and the Emperor unconditionally. And it was a virtue of a soldier to faithfully follow orders from above.However, only at this point could they shake off the deep-rooted military spirit and change the situation when the Special Force would be created in the future.\u201c.. Well, I don\u2019t know, maybe you\u2019re right. It would seem even more ridiculous to others if I said my power was nothing. I didn\u2019t think of any part of what you said because it was an atmosphere where you were treated like that from the beginning.\u201dEmon pulled up the tip of one lip, looking down at the pipe with the lights off.\u201cIf the training improves the way we use our powers as you say, then maybe our situation, which doesn\u2019t seem like it will evolve for years, can improve.\u201dIn the Orr Empire, there was a strong perception that the military was only under a group of knights with strong power and only filled the number of heads.Since mana and aura became available to humans, war had always belonged to those who knew how to use such power.There was a time in ancient times when tactics and individual soldiers\u2019 skills were important. But now no one had ever thought of such a thing. It had just been a long time since it was more important to win whether a swordmaster and an archmage were on our side or not.After all, it was no exaggeration to say that the main duties of the Orr\u2019s Imperial Army were to protect its borders, maintain security, and deal with annoying monsters.Still, the generals who led the military came from nobility, but they didn\u2019t accept the position with real force.Only generals who led the Southern and Northern armies took over as swordmasters for generations and used them as a way to enhance their honor and gain higher power.It was as rare as possible to maintain the position of General for a long time despite his outstanding skills as General Gino Bordelli when he had no desire to be promoted.Nevertheless, the reason why the number of commoners entering the military was not decreasing was simple. Because of the two advantages of being able to receive money stably without suffering from the exploitation of the landlord, and being able to move around from home to home rarely.Those who applied for the military were mostly children born into poor commoners\u2019 families and pushed to reduce their mouths to feed.Still, things were a little better if they could join the army. In many cases, the mercenary corps or the upper and lower ranks only worked as chores until they died.Sometimes, even though they were a commoner who came in like that, they would be promoted to a fairly high position when it was revealed that they had a great talent for martial arts during training.However, such incidents were few and far between the one thousand years of the empire\u2019s history.Yuder speculated that the lethargic attitude of soldiers wandering in the mountains for two years and the attitude of undermining themselves was probably attributed to that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOne of the main reasons Yuder had initially paid little mind to the news that a special forces unit was being formed was because he knew the military's morale significantly deteriorated.The soldiers in front of him lacked confidence in their strength and couldn't imagine a future better than their current circumstances.How could such people have possibly come together to form a special unit? Could it have been that someone with power secretly helped them establish it by offering a sweet reward? Perhaps someone like the emperor who had promised glory to the special forces while driving Yuder towards death.Yuder opened his mouth, looking into their eyes.\"This power can certainly be an enormous opportunity. Be sure to understand its value properly so you can grasp the opportunity when it comes. And if you need help with this matter, feel free to seek me out at any time.\"\"You seem to know more about this power than we do... but how are we to know who to look for?\"Emon asked with a hesitant expression. Instead of replying, Yuder picked up a metal fork that was lying on the table.A moment later, a thin stream of water swirled above the fork, forming a beautiful spiral. Upon witnessing this, Emon and Sunz's eyes widened in astonishment.\"I am Yuder of the Cavalry.\"Yuder purposely didn't mention his rank. It was likely to win him more favor from them.\"I've only been in the Cavalry for a few months myself. I'm not much different from you all. However, I believe in the future that this power can bring about. I hope that you too will come to understand its true value.\"That was all. There were no ulterior motives. By stating this upfront, he preemptively eliminated any potential for misinterpretation.Yuder stood up, looking at Sunz and Emon, who had stunned expressions. He had seen all he needed to see. It was time to leave.\"Thank you for showing me around the village, Sunz. I'll be on my way now.\"\"Ah...\"Yuder turned his back before Sunz could speak. Young soldiers were laughing raucously, completely oblivious to what had transpired at the corner table.Even after he had left, the two men behind him sat in silence for a long time, unable to utter a word.------The next day, the Cavalry, together with the Knights of Peletta, all left their lodgings at dawn. Kishiar was waiting for them in front of the base they had seen last night, alongside General Gino.\"I'm not sure if you all managed to get a good rest last night.\"Despite the fact that he had said he was going to drink with General Gino, Kishiar looked completely unweary.\"As I mentioned yesterday, we will start retrieving the Red Stone from today. For today, we will identify the location of the stone and assess the extent to which we can approach it, and gather information.\"Yesterday, General Gino had said that a strange energy was emanating from the Red Stone, making it difficult for ordinary people to even approach it.However, people who were skilled enough to use Aura, particularly General Gino, could approach it quite closely. The Cavalry could not predict how they would perceive this.\"If during the journey, anyone feels it's too difficult to approach due to the strange phenomena caused by the stone, they should stop walking and report to me before starting their descent. There is no shame in descending. That, too, will be helpful in gathering information.\"'Well, with General Gino, the Swordmaster, by our side, we wouldn't need to worry about the nuisances.'Yuder reinterpreted Kishiar's words from his own perspective. Kishiar's rhetorical skills, able to sugarcoat any message, were still amazing.If Yuder had been in that position, he would have bluntly told the nuisances to immediately descend and stay out of the way.'If they get into trouble while descending, or after they have descended, I would have threatened them, saying I won't let them off easily.'\"Now, let's move.\"Despite many people's concerns, Kishiar said he would lead the way. He did say that he would keep General Gino right behind him, but the Pelleta Knights, who had the duty to protect him, showed clear signs of anxiety. Yuder, knowing Kishiar's ability, was not very worried.'Rather... I should find the right moment to say I want to talk, but I wonder when that would be.'Kishiar moved forward without hesitation, as if he knew the path ahead. His steps were light, like those of a man out for a stroll. If it weren't for the divine sword hanging at his waist, one might truly believe it.Not long after they began walking, the traces of human footsteps gradually disappeared. The birds that had been chirping from the trees also became invisible, leaving only the dense forest and the occasional sound of the wind.'So far, I don't feel anything unusual.'Yuder was keenly observing the aura surrounding them as he moved.The steep uphill began, but the Cavalry, who had undergone rigorous training, ascended the mountain without showing any signs of fatigue. Yuder felt as if he was returning home, which was quite invigorating.'After all, having grown up in the same mountain range, it's not an exaggeration to say that I've returned home.'The clear and majestic energy of the Airic Mountain Range, which he hadn't walked in a long time, seemed to welcome Yuder.To the Yuder of eleven years ago, it would have been a few months since he last visited, but the current Yuder, who had lived and died without setting foot in his hometown for a very long time, was experiencing this feeling after a long time.Before joining the cavalry, he would wander these mountains alone, chopping wood and digging up medicinal herbs. He spent his days endlessly repeating the cycle of wandering all day and returning home to rest before sunset. He never felt lonely living alone. Probably.Others asked how he could live alone in a mountain teeming with monsters and wild beasts, but Yuder never found the mountain scary. It must have been his natural disposition.Even though he was much more naive than he is now, the essence of Yuder back then wasn't much different from the present.'A creepy human who only knows himself, ignorant of emotions.'Yuder recalled the words others used to describe him during his youth.Would those who couldn't even meet his gaze out of fear back then say the same about the current Cavalry and Yuder?\"There's a spring over there. We'll take a short break.\"About two hours into their silent trek up the mountain trail, Kishiar gestured towards a spot and declared it was time for a rest. As he had indicated, there was a spring up ahead, seemingly man-made.A man-made spring with no signs of recent human activity. It was evidence that until two years ago before the Red Stone fell, humans had relatively free access to this area.The party members each found a rock or tree stump to sit on and rest. Some approached the spring to drink water. Yuder watched Kanna chatting with the Eldore siblings, thinking that Kanna and Hinn had become quite close since they had shared the same accommodations the night before.Kishiar was discussing something with General Gino, a map that they'd taken out from their belongings in hand. Would there be an opportunity for a personal conversation with him until they retrieved the Red Stone and returned? If no such opportunity arose, Yuder wondered if he might just have to approach him directly.\"Yuder.\"Just then, Gakane sat down next to Yuder. Despite the fast-paced climb up the mountain, Gakane looked perfectly fine, without a single drop of sweat on him.\"Feeling anything yet?\"\"No.\"\"Me neither. Seems like everyone is fine so far.\"Could the Red Stone really be up there? Gakane murmured, looking up at the sky. It was a cloudless, clear day.\"Where did you live? Is it far from here?\"\"Hmm... It would probably take a few days to get there.\"\"That's quite far. It would have been nice to drop by if it was closer, after we finish our business.\"Yuder studied Gakane's regretful face, trying to understand his intention. Was it just an extension of him inviting Yuder to visit where he lived?Yuder himself didn't particularly want to visit the place he used to live, so he found Gakane's words hard to understand. If he were to take a vacation, he could visit, but only to tidy up the house.In the past, when he became a Cavalry Commander, he had tidied up his original house and spent his whole life in the barracks. He had no longing for the house where he used to live.\"There's not much... to see there.\"\"But it's where you lived. Don't you want to go back and see it, even for a little while?\"What would Gakane think if he said no here? Yuder was lost in thought and only noticed the approaching presence behind them later than usual.\"Go back where?\"\"Commander.\"As Gakane startled and tried to rise from his seat, Kishiar raised his hand to stop him. He seemed to have finished his conversation with General Gino and was now alone.\"Did you have other business besides the mission?\"\"No, no.\"Gakane seemed rather intimidated by Kishiar, their commander. Yuder saw him looking for help and calmly opened his mouth.\"My hometown is around here.\"\"Hmm. Your hometown?\"Interest flickered in Kishiar's red eyes.\"I see. So it's relatively close, then?\"\"Not exactly. The Airic Mountains are quite vast.\"\"So you were discussing visiting it if it were nearby.\"Finally, Kishiar seemed to piece together the conversation that had been going on between Gakane and Yuder.\"Yes.\"\"I see... Yuder. I remember you didn't have a family, do you miss your hometown?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Do you miss your hometown, Yuder?\"Kishiar, as usual, wore a gentle smile.Yuder didn't attach much significance to the question. However, Gakane, who was sitting next to him, was incessantly shifting his expressions. He seemed to believe that the commander was scolding Yuder indirectly.'Kishiar is not the type to do that. He's indeed a bit eccentric, but\u2026.'Ah, another unnecessary thought. Yuder shook his head and briefly replied, \"No.\"\"As you said, I have no family, and no lingering regrets, so I do not miss it. I only feel that I should go back someday to tidy up, as I left without doing so, not knowing I would be accepted into the Cavalry.\"\"That's a valid point. I hadn't considered it. After we successfully complete this mission, I'll have to give everyone a few days of leave.\"At Kishiar's smooth response, Gakane's eyes widened in surprise.Not only was Yuder's audacity to converse so casually with the commander, who held a high noble title, shocking, but so was Kishiar's easygoing nature. He did not reprimand Yuder for his insolence and even casually mentioned future plans.\"Um\u2026 Commander, is that okay?\"\"What do you mean?\"Gakane cautiously composed himself and posed the question.\"Deciding on something like a sudden leave for everyone...\"\"Of course, it's okay. I have the discretion to make such decisions. I won't change my mind, so Gakane, you too should start planning ahead.\"Kishiar gave a slight wink. Gakane had always thought of Kishiar as a person of great dignity, his conduct fitting his imperial lineage. However, seeing Kishiar's casual demeanor, all thoughts disappeared from Gakane's mind due to shock.\"I'll... I'll go get some water.\"Yuder watched Gakane rise shakily and disappear, guessing the kind of shock he must be feeling.Those who judged Kishiar by his outward appearance were bound to be shocked by the discrepancy with his true character. Yuder had once been the same.On the surface, Kishiar might appear as a dignified commander with a handsome face, reflecting his divine lineage, but that was not all there was to Kishiar La Orr.He was an imperial family member, who never married and maintained an insignificant noble title until his death. He was a womanizer, indiscriminately sowing seeds of scandal with countless individuals.Now, the newly formed Cavalry needed to establish discipline, so he maintained a calm demeanor externally. However, once you peeled back one layer of his mask, he casually winked at his subordinates. That was another side of Kishiar.The Cavalry members would probably have to get used to this aspect of his.'Come to think of it\u2026 Now that Gakane is gone, this is the only time I can speak privately with Kishiar?'Despite the lapse in conversation, Kishiar remained seated next to Yuder. After hesitating for a moment, Yuder opened his mouth.\"May I ask you something?\"\"Only if it wasn't about disappointment in my unfitting behavior as a leader.\"Kishiar responded as if he had been waiting. Yuder sighed lightly and shook his head. Could a mere member dare to do so?\"Of course not.\"\"Really? You, Yuder, seemed like someone who could.\"What did he mean by someone who could? But Yuder knew well that digging into that here would only waste time.Pointlessly making unnecessary comments to break down the opponent's walls and guess their intentions was one of the things Kishiar used to do well in the past.\"Fine. If not, then what are you trying to say?\"\"Do you know that among the southern army soldiers who have stayed here for two years guarding the Red Stone, there are unusually many Awakeners?\"As there wasn't much time, he went straight to the point.\"From what I heard from the soldier who guided us yesterday, the ratio was significantly higher than expected. If you add them all up, there are dozens of Awakeners in these mountains.\"If Kishiar had asked why he suddenly mentioned this, it would have been quite a conundrum as to where to begin the explanation. However, fortunately, he seemed to understand right away what Yuder intended to say.His playful red eyes immediately became serious.\"...I have never received such a report.\"\"I heard they were mostly ordinary soldiers.\"\"And they didn't even apply to the Cavalry.\"Why didn't they apply to the Cavalry, why didn't anyone think to report it as an unusual occurrence when there were so many Awakeners, how much had Kishiar realized?Yuder quietly waited for his response.\"If it's true, then we need an investigation. Originally, the military is not something I can interfere with, but if what you say is true, this is not a normal situation. The words you just said, they are based on the truth, right?\"\"Of course.\"Kishiar's reaction was more favorable than Yuder had expected. With a calm face, Yuder nodded. It was something that would come out sooner or later if they investigated anyway.Kishiar, who seemed lost in thought for a moment, stroking his chin, turned his gaze with a soft chuckle as if he had finished sorting things out.\"Well, I didn't expect that the serious thing you wanted to talk about with such a grave face was this.\"\"...\"\"I heard you're not particularly interested in your comrades, but it seems you're quite interested in the Awakeners?\"\"I...\"What should he answer here to smoothly move on and establish a not-so-bad relationship with Kishiar in the future? Underneath his emotionless face, Yuder was having a fierce internal debate.\"It's not that I'm interested... I just thought it could be dangerous. Since you, the leader, are the one commanding us, I thought it would be best to tell you about matters related to the Awakeners.\"\"Dangerous... Unmanaged Awakeners gathered in one organization, it could be.\"It was a fundamental answer, so it probably didn't feel strange. Kishiar murmured lowly and slowly nodded.\"Interesting. It's curious that so many Awakeners appeared in this one place. I wonder if it's because of the Red Stone.\"He turned his gaze towards Yuder as if contemplating something.\"What do you think?\"Yuder maintained a moment of silence. What should he respond? Would it be better to feign ignorance and take a step back in this situation? However, it was him who had brought up a matter that a normal, commoner-originated awakened individual wouldn't even care about to Kishiar.'He seems to want to know how far I've thought.'In that case, he could just show him. After all, Kishiar would have already speculated about what Yuder could answer.Yuder slowly opened his mouth.\"When the Red Stone fell, its emitted power caused awakenings across the entire continent. If such a powerful force can do that, isn't it not coincidental that many awakened individuals would come from among those who stayed closer to it for a longer period?\"\"Right. I also think the same.\"Kishiar smiled like a teacher who had finally heard the answer he was seeking.\"However, those who haven't reported to me about the unique awakening ratio among the soldiers here even after two years since the stone fell probably didn't think that way. You've quickly noticed this anomaly and even reported it to me, which is a matter they might have considered insignificant. I admire your ability. Is that observational and judgmental ability part of your awakened ability?\"\"...No, you're flattering me.\"\"It's not flattery. It's sincere.\"With a single sentence, Kishiar had rated all the soldiers here, including General Gino, as inferior to Yuder. As Yuder hesitated about how to respond, Kishiar's red eyes sparkled like a clever beast, without a hint of his usual languor.\"Hmm. Indeed.\"\"Yes?\"\"I proposed before that we should get to know each other better. Would you seriously consider it? I promise you won't be disappointed.\"His voice was sweet, more like throwing a charm towards someone he liked rather than talking to a subordinate. Any ordinary person would have blushed at such words, but Yuder, on the contrary, became calmer.\"I'm already your subordinate, Captain. You've been more than generous with me. I'm not sure what you mean by getting closer here, but\u2026\"\"Oh? So, you're going to dodge it this time?\"Kishiar grinned, pulling up the corners of his mouth.\"Well, fine. I'm the type who feels more accomplished when I break down a higher wall.\"A high wall. It was not an expression that someone of imperial lineage would use to a commoner.\"Just as I said, you're already my subordinate, so let's take a long-term view.\"That was a declaration that he wouldn't give up on his intention. As Yuder's eyes twitched, Kishiar stood up from his seat. It seemed he was about to set off again.\"Yuder Aile. If you notice any strange circumstances in the future, feel free to report them to me anytime. If I'm not around and you meet my deputy or other people, feel free to talk to them as you would to me. I'll let them know.\"\"\u2026Understood.\"For a single conversation, it was a remarkable achievement. It was also a gesture that proved Kishiar had a significant interest in Yuder's mind and abilities.'He's certainly no ordinary man.'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay'He's certainly not an ordinary human.'And Yuder, too, marveled anew at Kishiar's abilities during their brief conversation.Swift action and decisiveness upon identifying the necessary skills. A privilege that seemed trivial but was likely the result of foresight into the future of the Cavalry. An unpretentious attitude, disregarding status. A mind capable of sincerely and unbiasedly receiving and considering others' words.Having held the same position as Commander of the Cavalry, Yuder felt Kishiar's capabilities even more vividly.During his time as commander, Yuder had met many kings and nobles, including the Emperor of the Orr Empire, and respected abilities within and outside the country.It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that he had met almost all the high-ranking individuals of the continent. However, possessing power and status did not necessarily mean one also had wisdom.Those with power and status were suspicious of others. The more one had, the more human nature dictated the need to be wary of one's surroundings. Those who deviated from this norm were either uninterested in worldly affairs or displayed an indifferent attitude toward everything.Yet, Kishiar didn't fit into either category.'I think it was the same back then. I was often surprised because he was different from the image of the imperial family that I vaguely imagined.'\"...\"Suddenly, he felt a bitter taste in his mouth. He had recalled the reason why Kishiar had died so quickly.\"Alright, let's get moving again.\"Before Yuder's thoughts could wander further, Kishiar announced the end of their break. The scattered members regrouped and reformed their ranks. Gakane, who had gone to drink water, also returned to Yuder's side.\"Yuder. What did you talk about with the commander?\"There was a look of disbelief in Gakane's eyes.\"We didn't talk about much.\"\"Even so...... It seems like you're not having any difficulty with him at all.\"\"I haven't done anything wrong, so why would it be difficult?\"\"Well, I guess that's true.\"Gakane sighed quietly, gazing at Kishiar's strong back as he walked ahead.\"I always feel scared when I stand before him. I must be a coward.\"His last words were a whisper barely audible, but Yuder heard them clearly.'Coward? Gakane Bolunwald, the social butterfly?'Yuder found it laughable, almost as if a passing dog had spoken, but Gakane seemed to be quite sincere.Gakane Bolunwald was tall and well-built, even among the 330 Cavalry members. He came from a reputable family, was cheerful, and had a dazzling appearance. He was even an Alpha, according to what he heard yesterday.With such promising future prospects, it was hard to believe he was a coward. It felt as if he was being too modest.'I didn't think he had a self-deprecating personality.'But that wasn't a big problem. The Cavalry was only going to thrive from now on. Once Gakane adapted to that, he would change.Reminiscing about how Gakane had actively represented the Cavalry, being pulled into all sorts of tasks from Yuder's past memories, he looked away from Gakane's worried expression.Right now, something more important came to his mind after hearing that Gakane was an Alpha.'Come to think of it, I haven't told Kishiar about the matter regarding the second gender manifestation.'Even so, he was not worried because of what Kishiar had said earlier. He had said that it was okay to come and talk comfortably in the future, so he thought he could pass on the information whenever he had the time.------As they approached the place with the Red Stone, the mountain forest grew increasingly quiet. At first, they had felt no signs of beasts or birds, but now even the sounds of insects had ceased.Around this time, the first signs of physical distress appeared. It was one of the Knights of Peletta.\"Guh... Hah...!\"\"Lug!\"As one knight staggered and knelt, another knight who had been beside him called out his name in haste and supported him. Everyone stopped and turned to look at him. The fallen knight's face was terribly pale, and sweat poured from his forehead like rain.\"What happened?\"\"S-sorry, Your Grace. Suddenly, it feels like something is pressing down on my head...\"When Kishiar approached and asked, the knight tried to force himself to stand. However, just as he said, it seemed as if something really was pressing him down, and he collapsed again. His face became even paler.\"Urgh...\"\"Don't try to move forcefully.\"Kishiar, who had reached out to prevent the knight from moving, turned his head and looked at General Gino. The general was calmly examining the knight.\"It begins now. They held on longer than my men, but we'll start to see dropouts soon.\"\"Do they all react as if they're feeling physical pressure?\"\"Yes, it's similar. But it seems that knight endured too much.\"\"Didn't I tell them to step back as soon as it gets tough?\"At Kishiar's words, the knight's expression darkened.\"I apologize. But thinking I might be the first one to fall behind...\"The knight's gaze moved sequentially to Kishiar and General Gino, both with unblemished faces, and then to the horsemen beside them. Yuder thought his pointless stubbornness was foolish.\"General. You said it gets better as the distance increases, right?\"\"Yes. It heals as if it were a lie.\"\"He doesn't seem capable of going down on his own. Someone has to help.\"As Kishiar carefully surveyed the surroundings, his gaze halted at the Eldore siblings.\"Hinn Eldore, Finn Eldore.\"\"Yes.\"\"The ability you said could only be used when you're together, can you use it now?\"The siblings, who looked identical as if they were reflections in a mirror, looked at each other. The knights looked puzzled, but the Cavalry, who knew why the siblings had joined the journey, remained calm.\"It should be possible if it\u2019s near the place where we rested by the spring earlier.\"Hinn estimated the distance and asked her younger sibling, Finn, who responded with a nod.\"Good. Try it right away.\"\"Understood.\"As the Eldore siblings approached the fallen knight, the knight seemed a little frightened.\"W-what ability is this? I can go back by myself. There's really no need to...\"\"Don't worry. It's nothing. How can you say you can go back by yourself when you can't even stand?\"\"We'll send you back to the spring where we were earlier in no time, rest there a bit and then go back.\"The siblings easily quelled the knight's defiance with a single sentence and stood facing each other, enclosing him between them.\"I've heard about their development of movement abilities during their training, but it's the first time I'm seeing them use it in person. Do you think it'll work?\" Kanna, who had moved closer to Yuder, murmured in a small voice, her expression filled with concern. However, Yuder wasn't particularly worried.'There may be various restrictions when casting, but it should not be a problem in a situation like this. We're not in the middle of combat, and we're not pressed for time.'The Eldore siblings had the ability to teleport entities or objects between them to any ground they both had previously set foot on.However, the ability had its limitations. The teleportation distance was short, the casting took considerable time, and they couldn't use it while in transit, which made it not the most practical of abilities.'So, their tasks mainly involved being deployed to places requiring combat power. The teleportation ability was used when they needed to relay tactical orders to the following forces. That would have been enough.'Yuder had never undertaken a mission with them before. Although he had sent them on a few assignments since becoming the leader, he had hardly interacted with them personally, so the current situation felt quite novel.'Well, let's see how well they do.'Kishiar, too, seemingly shared his sentiment as he watched the siblings holding hands around the knight, his arms crossed casually. As Hinn and Finn closed their eyes to concentrate, the knight looked up at them with growing fear.\"Your Grace. Deputy Commander. I'll descend on my own. I'm truly sorry for being stubborn out of embarrassment. But this...!\"\"Quiet. It's almost done, let's go!\"As Finn, who had just opened his eyes, shouted, a whirlwind of blue energy erupted from the hand they held together. As the energy enveloped the knight, a slight gust of wind blew, and the knight gasped as if he was about to faint.\"What is this? Wait. Just wait a moment...!\"But he couldn't finish his sentence, for the moment the blue whirlwind completely enveloped him, he vanished. When he disappeared, the wind subsided, and the blue energy that had been rippling was absorbed back between the hands of the siblings as if it was being sucked in.\"It's like the teleportation magic that was said to be used in ancient times.\"General Gino, who had watched the scene, quietly made his comment. Seeing him show interest for the first time, having been composed all this while, a sense of pride spread across the faces of the Eldore siblings.\"I was wondering why such young-looking kids were brought along. Was it for this purpose?\"\"I can't say that's the only reason, but you could say that. Their true abilities are more geared towards offense.\"General Gino's gaze swept over the Cavalry members.\"I'm curious about the abilities the others possess, given Your Majesty's statement.\"\"Even at your age, your competitive spirit remains.\"\"Do I appear so? Rather than wanting to compete, it's merely curiosity.\"At Kishiar's words, General Gino gave a faint smile.\"Well, you may deny it, but I see it all.\"After saying that, Kishiar told the others that they would now resume their journey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you notice any symptoms, no matter how minor, speak up immediately. If anyone appears unable to walk on their own, Hinn Eldore and Finn Eldore will assist them as before.\"\"Understood.\"The gaze of the remaining four members of the Peletta Knights hardened. They too must have been reluctant to be swept away by the mysterious blue wind to an unknown location.Not long after, two of the Peletta Knights raised their hands, confessing they couldn't bear the pressure any longer, and descended.As the surrounding scenery gradually turned barren, with lush trees and grasses disappearing and only rocks beginning to surface, another one retreated.What remained were a single Peletta Knight, five Cavalry members, Commander Kishiar and General Gino. Compared to the Cavalry members, who showed no signs of fatigue, the lone Peletta knight's breath was growing ragged, seemingly struggling.Yuder identified him as the knight who had led the way here, the one the other knights had called 'deputy-commander.' He seemed to be the highest-ranking of the Peletta Knights who had come this time.'He seems to be the most capable among them, too.'It was believable that Swordmaster General Gino and Commander Kishiar were unaffected, but was it really coincidence that all five Cavalry members seemed fine? Yuder had kept a close eye on the energy flowing around him as he ascended. However, so far, he hadn't noticed anything unusual.\"Gakane, how are you feeling?\"\"I'm fine. If anything, I feel a bit more energetic as we get closer to where the stone is... I've been wondering if the stone that awakened us might be the reason.\"Gakane, after hearing the question, examined his own arms and legs before responding. Yuder thought his theory might have some merit.\"We're almost there. If we climb up there, we will be able to see the massive crater created by the falling stone at once.\"As the trees began to disappear and they finally arrived at a slope primarily composed of rocks, General Gino addressed Kishiar.\"Right, that place, called the Navel of the World or something equally grandiose. I'm quite eager to see what it looks like.\"The Navel of the World. Listening to their conversation, Yuder sifted through the information he remembered from the past.The Yuder of the past had not participated in the Red Stone retrieval operation, but before his death, he had read a brief piece of information about the massive crater created by the falling stone while researching the Red Stone.One day, the Red Stone fell from the sky, landing in the middle of the Airic Mountains, instantly destroying all surrounding trees and land and creating a massive crater. It was said that the size of the crater was so large that nearly a whole city's worth of forest disappeared. Even after the stone was retrieved, no trees or grass grew there.Finally, the party stood at the end of the slope. And before their eyes lay a breathtaking sight\u2014an endless, gigantic chasm.It was as if someone had scooped out a part of the mountain with a colossal spoon. The enormous crater wasn't just a crater\u2014it was more akin to a valley or a rift.\"I have a feeling the air is different from here on out. It gives me the chills.\"Gakane crinkled his nose, peering down into the abyss. His statement was not just a figment of his imagination. Yuder also felt a similar sensation, looking at the dizzyingly vast pit.'Yes, this is the feeling.'Long ago, when he saw the Red Stone that Kishiar had retrieved from a distance, he felt a strange energy. It was as if the invisible air from all around was pressing down on him, a faint pressure that seemed to ride on the wind.\"What a refreshing sight. Let's proceed downward now.\"Kishiar looked around with a unique appreciation. There didn't seem to be any safe paths, but they had to descend. The Red Stone they were seeking lay right in the middle of that immense pit.\"Your Highness, I... I think I should not proceed any further.\"The last remaining Peletta Knight spoke to Kishiar, who was about to descend a suitable slope.\"I'm having difficulty breathing.\"\"Alright, understood. Stay here, a little further away.\"\"I apologize. I should follow you until the end... I am ashamed.\"\"You've done an excellent job just by following us this far. Don't worry about it.\"Finally, the last remaining knight withdrew as well. Tension appeared on the faces of the Cavalry members.They carefully stepped down, ensuring they did not slip. As they descended, the pressure became stronger, until it felt as if thousands of needles were prickling their entire bodies by the time they reached the bottom.'It seems that all the Cavalry members are in a similar state... Is it because we are Awakeners?'Yuder scanned the faces of the slowly moving members. Although they felt the pressure, none of them seemed to be having trouble breathing.\"General, which way should we go now?\"\"Head straight towards the center of the pit. The stone is very small, so you can only see it when you get close.\"Kishiar questioned, and General Gino answered. Even he seemed to feel a significant pressure now, as his brows were furrowed.Only Kishiar and Yuder did not show any changes in their expressions.'The World Sphere didn't emit such strong energy.'As Yuder approached the location of the Red Stone, he recalled the World Sphere he had seen countless times.The World Sphere, long kept embedded in the Sanctuary Forest, did give off a slightly strange sensation when approached, but it did not emit such rough and intense energy.'It's clear that the energy of the Red Stone was reduced and disappeared due to the refining process in the Pearl Tower. What the hell were they trying to do?'The mages of the Pearl Tower, who had refined the Red Stone into the World Sphere, Yuder did not know what their purpose was, but he thought it probably wasn't a good one.'They did more than one or two pieces of trashy research there.'Originally, the Pearl Tower was a place created by the Archmage Pierre Mice, who wanted to lead mages who did not want to be influenced by any political purpose and solely desired to practice magic.Like a clam that coats a foreign substance with hundreds, thousands of layers of nacre to create a single pearl, they were obsessed with magic and lived only for magic, layering countless magics to achieve the essence. They named it the Pearl Tower, symbolizing their aspiration to pile up countless magic to form the essence.At first, they were indeed ostracized, but as time passed, the situation changed. The Pearl Tower produced numerous archmages and released several outstanding research findings.Until recently, when people thought of mages, the image of court mages working exclusively for the state was strong. But the mages of the Pearl Tower didn't work for anyone. They researched and trained freely.Those bound by the state, moving for the elite, couldn't compare with those who trained freely. After a few centuries, all the countries could no longer ignore the Pearl Tower, and it grew into an organization representing all mages.The problem was that over time, their original good intentions gradually twisted into something strange.The goal of existing solely for magic was gone. The current Pearl Tower clung to the power structures of various nations, using their power for them and consistently conducting inhumane research.The creation of the Misty Wind Horse was one of the less inhumane experiments they conducted. At least it was a product of research using captured monsters and beasts.The mages of the Pearl Tower struggled to the bitter end to not lose the power they obtained through the Awakeners' Red Stone. Yuder strongly suspected that their efforts to refine the Red Stone into a World Sphere were part of that struggle.'Good riddance. Even if I didn't do it.'Yuder chuckled as he recalled the destruction of the Pearl Tower, one of the charges that led to his execution.\"The stone is in sight.\"At that moment, General Gino spoke heavily. Yuder's gaze, lost in the past, followed his. Half-buried in the ground where General Gino was looking was a stone the size of a fist.The stone looked completely ordinary. If it wasn't the only stone in this desolate place, no one would have thought it was the Red Stone.It was a slightly gloomy color, rough but generally round in shape.Even though they were still quite far away, the stone was very clearly visible because there was nothing around it. The party all stopped, each absorbed in their own emotions. Some showed reverence, some fear, and some simple curiosity.Yuder also felt a very strange feeling the moment he saw the stone. But what he felt was far from the reverence or fear of the others.'Because of that.'Because of that, his fate had changed.Yuder, once an ordinary peasant boy, had become an Awakener, possessing the greatest power in the world, and was eventually executed for the crime of trying to touch that stone. His life and death had essentially been determined by that stone.'And now it's a stone that needs to be carefully observed and protected.'Previously, he had not been able to closely examine the stone before it was chipped away. But this time was different. Yuder resolved to use this opportunity he'd been given more wisely than anyone else.\"How's everyone feeling?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"How is everyone holding up?\"Kishiar, who had halted his steps to scrutinize the stone, turned to the others as though he had made some kind of assessment.\"We previously stopped a little further from here. Roughly, that's the limit we can endure while the gods protect our bodies.\"General Gino answered first. He appeared calm on the surface, but as he drew closer to the stone, his movements gradually slowed. This signified that he was experiencing a pressure strong enough to restrict the movements of a Swordmaster.\"I, well, my skin hurts a bit, but I think I can go a bit further.\"\"Same here. It feels like something is pricking my face, but I can endure it.\"\"I'm in the same boat.\"After Kanna's response, Hinn and Gakane also chimed in. Since Hinn would obviously share the same opinion as her brother, the only one left was Yuder.\"Me too.\"\"I'm the same as you lot. It's rather unpleasant but bearable. If all five of us are experiencing the same thing, it's likely due to us being Awakeners.\"Kishiar grinned, seemingly amused. Before moving forward, he glanced towards the Red Stone and then gave a brief order to General Gino.\"General, there's no need for you to follow us to the limit. Just stay there. The Cavalry and I will be back.\"\"...Understood.\"They began to move cautiously. Now, the stone was so close that they could touch it if they fell.As they got closer to the stone, the prickling pressure on their skin increased, and every step became incomparably heavier. It was like forcefully traversing the depths of a turbulent sea.However, it was not so painful that they'd collapse, spilling blood. It was surprisingly bearable, to a startling degree.\"Everyone, halt.\"Finally, when Kishiar declared it was okay not to proceed any further, they were only about ten steps away from the stone.'That's the Red Stone.'He hadn't expected to see it this close, in this way. Yuder quietly gazed down at the half-buried Red Stone and took a deep breath.'It's just a stone... But let's not let our guards down.'\"It looks surprisingly ordinary.\"Kishiar, while looking at the red stone, verbalized what everyone was thinking.\"Now then... Kanna Wand.\"\"Yes? Uh, yes.\"Kanna, startled by her name being called out of the blue, responded. Kishiar gave her a gentle smile.\"Do you think you can read that stone using your ability?\"At Kishiar's words, the same thought occurred to everyone, except Yuder.'So that's why she was brought along.'The others possessed abilities useful in combat, but not Kanna. If the reason she was chosen was to read the information from the Red Stone, it made sense. It might be impossible, but if possible, they might learn something truly astonishing.'That's right. There was hardly any known information about the Red Stone even before.'Yuder had suspected that Kishiar might ask this of Kanna ever since he chose her. Even if he had been the leader, he would have certainly tried if there had been someone with Kanna's ability.From the very beginning, the reason Yuder had insisted on Kanna's successful admission into the Cavalry was precisely in anticipation of situations like this.'Back then, I was desperately lacking information. In all respects.'By the time the past Yuder had realized something was off, it was already too late. The people and the information that had vanished with the passage of time couldn't be retrieved, no matter what he did.However, with Kanna, the story was different. Of course, provided that she could touch and read it.\"I'm not sure. If I can touch it... I think I could at least try. But whether I'll be successful...\"Kanna's ability required her to physically touch the object to read its information. Could she really touch that stone, which radiated such a tremendous pressure that it stung the skin even from a distance, for an extended period of time? Could she guarantee she wouldn't get hurt? It was something no one could tell.And as if he had been waiting for her to say that, Kishiar's red eyes turned towards Gakane.\"You're right. So, you might need some help. Gakane Volunbolt?\"\"Yes!\"Gakane responded loudly, his face startled.\"Use your shadow to touch the stone first.\"'...Indeed. I hadn't thought of that.'Yuder sincerely admired it. Gakane's ability was to summon shadows, primarily used for communication or to aid in combat.But to use it to first touch something as dangerous as the Red Stone... That was an inventive yet promising directive.Gakane, seemingly not expecting such an order, had an astonished look on his face. However, he soon used his ability without a word.The black shadow at his feet squirmed and distorted, then rose up and took on a black, doll-like form that mirrored Gakane's.'This is the first time I'm seeing it properly, even though he rarely uses it in practice.'Despite its apparent usefulness in daily life, Gakane rarely used this ability. When asked why, he said it was because the ability could become a sharp or a blunt knife depending on the user's capacity.'Such sound judgment indeed.'Gakane's shadow clone moved according to Gakane's will. That meant it couldn't exert more power than the main body was capable of.Would a sword wielded by a commoner and a swordmaster exhibit the same power? Of course not. A sword swung by a competent person could obliterate mountains and divide seas.Gakane's ability was similar. The higher the combat sense and skill of the main body, the brighter his ability shone. Recognizing this early and striving to enhance his own ability first, Gakane was already exemplary. There was a reason he shouldn't die young.\"I'll give it a try.\"After giving a terse response, Gakane directed his shadow clone, which cautiously began to walk towards the Red Stone. It didn't take many steps for the clone to reach the stone. It slowly knelt down and extended its hand.The shadow clone had effortlessly approached the stone that even the Swordmaster couldn't touch. Everyone held their breath as the shadow's fingertips were about to make contact with the stone.Sizzle!\"Ah!\"However, when the hand touched the stone, a blindingly white light burst forth.For the first time in his life, Yuder felt a strange energy trying to pierce his body. He quickly exerted his power, creating a barrier of water and air around everyone.A fierce gust of wind blew, and gasps of surprise echoed around, but there was no time to react.The energy, an enormous energy that felt as if it could engulf the entire world, was spreading out radially!'This is\u2026\u2026!'Maintaining the barrier was challenging, but it was better than nothing.Yuder gritted his teeth, closed his eyes, and maintained his strength. He felt as if the energy moving around him and the new energy emanating from the stone were interlocking, pushing and trying to erode each other.Despite his efforts to block the external energy, maintaining multiple barriers while focusing was a difficult task.How long did he keep that up?After a while, the pressure he felt through his skin suddenly decreased. Only then did Yuder withdraw the barrier and turn his gaze forward.Gakane's shadow clone was still sitting in its place. However, starting from the hand that had tried to touch the red stone, half of its upper body seemed to have exploded, leaving it in a ragged state.'Did the shadow clone explode?'If the one there had been a real person, if it had been Kanna, what would have happened?No, what would have been the outcome if the invisible force he had desperately blocked just now had pierced his body?A horrifying imagination suddenly dried his lips. Yuder, seeing everyone with similar expressions, turned his gaze to Gakane.\"Gakane. Are you okay?\"\"...I think, I'm okay.\"Gakane's face was pale, but he didn't seem to have suffered from the damage his shadow had taken. With a slight wave of his hand, the half-disappeared shadow returned to the ground and came back to his side.\"\u2026 It's a good thing we tried touching it first. We almost had a person injured. But what was that barrier that blocked the front just now?\"Kishiar, who seemed to have seen the barrier even amid the bright light, turned his gaze towards Yuder. There was no point in hiding it if he already suspected who had done it.\"I did it. I thought it would be better than nothing.\"\"Wasn't your ability to apply attributes to weapons only?\"\"... It's a utilization method I've recently realized. I haven't used it properly yet, but I exerted my strength desperately as it felt dangerous.\"\"What? Did Yuder do something?\"Yuder's answer was a bit forced, but it wasn't nonsensical. Indeed, there had been many instances in the past when he suddenly realized a new way to use his abilities.'It was a good idea to think ahead in case something like this happened.'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe party members were perplexed, unable to see Yuder's protective barrier, but only Kishiar widened his eyes slightly and smiled.\"Interesting... Marvelous, indeed. In that brief moment, it wasn't just self-preservation but the will to exercise your power for everyone else.\"\"No, it wasn't like that.\"Yuder lowered his head, but Kishiar's gaze lingered on his face for a while.\"Just by touching the stone, such an event unfolds. Moving it might not be as easy as we thought.\"\"...\"Everyone's expression darkened. Yuder was equally perturbed.'Has this happened before? How did they transport it then?'Before, Kishiar had retrieved the Red Stone and returned to the Cavalry with it in his hand. Since he had taken it directly to the palace, it wasn't that he couldn't move it. What had changed between then and now?While Yuder pondered, Kishiar issued a new command to the Eldore siblings.\"Is it possible to move it by placing the stone between you? Even a short distance would do. It would be great if you could try.\"\"Um... We'll try.\"However, the attempt was doomed before it even began in earnest. As soon as the siblings, who had struggled to position themselves on either side of the red stone, reached out to touch it, energy surged from the stone once again.\"It's clear that it reacts to something, even without direct contact.\"In the end, Kishiar decided it was unnecessary to attempt any further and suggested they head back.The group retraced their steps. Throughout the journey, the party members were silent, their expressions grave.\"You've worked hard today. I didn't expect everything to go smoothly from the start. Let's rest for now and regroup tomorrow. If anyone has something to say about what we've seen today, feel free to find me, no matter how late.\"As he spoke, Kishiar's gaze subtly shifted towards Yuder. Yuder, feeling the weight of that look, pretended not to notice.'I can't possibly know all the answers.'Although he had memories of the future, he couldn't know now what he didn't know then.Back in his quarters, Yuder lay on his bed, quietly pondering the day's events.The strange power emitted by the Red Stone, the reason only the Cavalry members could approach it, the reasons for its explosive behavior, the differences between the past and the present...Numerous memories swirled in his head, rapidly comparing and analyzing.'The biggest problem at the moment is that we can't move the stone.'In the past, Kishiar had quickly retrieved the stone and returned. There was a minor incident that revealed him as the owner of the divine sword, but that happened after the stone was retrieved.In other words, it was correct to think that the retrieval operation itself had been completed quickly without major delay.Then and now. What has changed?Of course, the party members chosen by Kishiar were all different. But that alone shouldn't have made a big difference...Deep in thought, Yuder's expression suddenly changed.'Come to think of it, when Kishiar brought the Red Stone in the past, he wasn't holding it directly in his hand.'The first time he saw Kishiar with the Red Stone, it had been tightly wrapped in a thick cloth to prevent it from being seen. The second and final time he saw it, it was encased in a box carved out of a transparent magic stone.He had never touched it directly.Could it have been the answer? It was an unknown, but it seemed worth trying.Yuder pondered for a moment before rising from his seat.\"Where are you going?\"Gakane, who had been lying on the adjacent bed immersed in thought like Yuder, looked up in surprise.\"Just need to clear my head a bit.\"Yuder quickly left the lodging, fearing Gakane might offer to accompany him. After sunset, the surroundings were dark and quiet.Once he confirmed that no one was around, Yuder looked at a stone near him. Although it was small, he decided to consider it a substitute for the red stone.'And... wrap it.'The force extending from Yuder's fingertips moved the earth beneath the stone. Sand slithered up, wrapping around the stone and starting to form a round sphere.When he felt it was the right size, Yuder wrapped the stone in soil, then called forth water by waving his hand in the air. The water flew towards the lump of earth, wrapping it before freezing into a shiny white shell.Yuder's ability allowed him to freely manipulate the elements of nature. Not only could he change the forms, but he could also control temperature. He picked up the large ice sphere, feeling its weight.'So easy with a regular stone.'Would the same method work with the Red Stone? It might be prudent to bring along a thick cloth as well. Yuder decided to pack one in his bag tomorrow.He dropped the ice sphere, and with another wave of his hand, the solid ice and earth broke and melted, seeping back into nature until they disappeared. All that was left was the original pebble.As he looked at it, Yuder wondered why Kishiar had needed to wrap the red stone so tightly.'The most likely reason is to shield even the slightest bit of the energy it emits.'The energy emanating from the stone was powerful. Just looking at the shattered shadow of Gakane, who had been hit directly by it, made it clear. Even with a protective barrier, the invisible force tried to penetrate into his body, making him feel breathless to this day.'And all that power came from a single small stone.'Yuder slowly looked down at his palm. He hadn't noticed until he came down the mountain, but after returning to the lodge and taking a closer look, there was a bruise on the back of his hand, as if something had pierced it.He couldn't tell when he got the bruise that looked as if something had exploded from within, but as he looked at it, he remembered.'Just before I put up the barrier, some of the force from the stone passed through my hand.'Something invisible had brushed through his body. It was a subtle but strange sensation. If this mark was indeed caused by that force, then putting up the barrier at that moment seemed to have been the right decision.'If that power had pierced my head, heart, or mana hole... I don't even want to think about it.'The damage was fortunately limited to his palm. The body of an Awakener was much more resilient than that of a normal person, but it wasn't invincible.In particular, the mana hole, located below the navel, was an extremely important organ. Although it didn't make its presence known regularly, if it were to be destroyed, one would neither be able to use abilities nor detect energy. As Yuder looked down at the area around his lower abdomen, he thought about this organ that was to be revealed to the world in about a year's time.At a glance, the bodies of the Awakener didn't seem to have changed much since their awakening. However, in reality, their bodies underwent many transformations. Were these changes really the natural ones prepared by God, as announced by the Pope and the Emperor?He had known well before his death that their words were not all trustworthy, but since he didn't consider this to be of significant importance, he had never thought deeply about it.However, having seen the original form of the Red Stone up close and personal, it seemed extraordinarily strange that the energy emitted by this tiny stone changed the bodies of countless people, including himself, and gave them new abilities.Yuder kicked the stone he had been looking at with the tip of his foot. The rolling stone came to a halt against someone's foot. Surprisingly, Kishiar La Orr was standing there.\"What brings you here?\"\"I was just taking a night stroll. What about you?\"\"Me too...the same.\"He actually had come out to sort out his thoughts on the Red Stone, but he fumbled a vague response. It was quite something to run into Kishiar in such a place again.Yuder intended to return to his quarters immediately, but Kishiar was a step quicker in striking up a conversation.\"Since we've met, shall we walk together for a bit?\"How could a mere member refuse the commander's request? Yuder sighed softly and nodded his head.Though Kishiar had invited him for a stroll, he remained silent for a while. Because of this, Yuder felt a strange pressure to start the conversation.\"...Sir...\"\"You are...\"In a coincidence, the words they had decided to speak overlapped. Yuder widened his eyes slightly, looking up at Kishiar who was gazing down at him, and lightly bit his lip.\"Please, you first.\"\"No, it wasn't important. You first.\"\"No, I was not going to say anything important either.\"There was nothing particularly friendly to be shared between him and Kishiar. His plan was to bring up today's events first and if there was nothing more to say, throw out a topic related to the second gender. As Yuder shook his head, Kishiar narrowed his eyes.\"Is that so? If it's not important, there's no harm in you going first. Even if I order you to speak first as your leader, you wouldn't like it?\"'This crafty...'Yuder's eyebrows twitched.His past of using the invincible excuse of 'orders from the leader' to make his subordinates do similar tasks momentarily disappeared from his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He found it amusing that a commoner, neither royal nor noble, could hardly disguise his displeasure over such a trivial matter.\"Understood... I was wondering what you would do if we couldn't find a way to retrieve the Red Stone as it is. Did I get it right?\"\"A way to retrieve it, huh?\"Kishiar was not at all bothered by Yuder's slightly prickly tone.\"Were you worrying about that?\"Well, it was his first mission, so it must have been worrisome. Kishiar surmised Yuder's concerns and met his gaze, his red eyes shifting slightly.\"Ever since before I came here, no, from the day I received the report that the stone had fallen from the sky, I've been receiving updates on the state of the Red Stone. No one else had come as close as we did, but that didn't mean others did nothing against the stone. Today, we simply intended to observe.\"\"So, are you saying that you're confident about retrieving it tomorrow?\"How? Yuder's black eyes, not hiding his doubt, gleamed quietly in the darkness. Instead of answering directly, Kishiar smiled.\"Curious, are you?\"\"Of course, I am.\"\"What about accepting the position of deputy to the Shin Division?\"\"I refuse.\"\"You said you wanted to know?\"\"I would know when I wake up tomorrow anyway, so there's no need to accept that just to find out a few hours earlier.\"It was a wise answer.\"While others would have readily accepted the offer for a higher position, you are quite obstinate. Why do you refuse?\"\"As I've said before, I'm not fit for such a position.\"His voice sounded cold, even to his own ears. But even if Kishiar found it strange, Yuder had no intention of accepting the deputy's position.A member with commoner background could never become the commander directly, even if the commander died. But a deputy could succeed to the commander's position. So, it was impossible. Yuder was resolved never to become a commander again, as he had been before.Reading his firm resolve, Kishiar let out a long sigh.\"If we go tomorrow and try a few more methods, and if they still don't work, I plan to dig up the land around the stone in its entirety and put it in a box. It might be safe as long as we don't touch it directly.\"A method of physical isolation and movement. It was the same conclusion Yuder had come to.\"I thought you'd find it ridiculous, but you seem surprisingly calm.\"\"It's not ridiculous. On the contrary, I might be able to help with my ability if we go with that method.\"\"That's reassuring.\"Kishiar let out a low laugh.\"I'm counting on you for tomorrow.\"\"...\"One topic had ended. Now it was Kishiar's turn to speak. Facing Yuder's silent gaze, Kishiar paused for a moment before opening his mouth.\"About what you told me during the day.\"There was only one thing Yuder could have said to him during the day. It was the story related to the information that there were unusually many awakeners among the regular soldiers of the Southern Army guarding the red stone.'Could he have already figured that out?'\"It turns out it was true.\"Kishiar immediately confirmed Yuder's speculation as true.\"And despite knowing, I never considered it important... knowing yet ignoring\u2026\"His smile wasn't his usual leisurely one, but one that exuded incredulity, hinting at his feelings.\"Gosh, what a close shave. If I had gone back and forth without any knowledge\u2026\"What would have happened? He would have been blindsided by the news of the special force's establishment years later.Unable to voice his thoughts, Yuder closed his mouth. Kishiar would have had the same prediction anyway.\"Your insight and judgment might be the abilities most needed by the current Cavalry and me. But no matter how good my proposition is, you keep refusing\u2026 What should I do with you?\"It seemed like a big dilemma. Although it sounded like a mumble, there was truth embedded in his words.\"What is there for you to do? If you need my abilities, I can be of help here.\"\"But you refuse to get closer, you don't want the deputy commander's position, you keep putting up walls\u2026 how far can I trust you?\"\"...\"His argument was not groundless. From the perspective of the commander who had to lead a newly formed Cavalry, Yuder's refusal could be seen as untrustworthy.Yuder pondered over how to convince him. However, his serious contemplation shattered with Kishiar's next words.\"Well then, shall we spend the night together? I'm confident in that aspect. I can make you forget about time.\"Yuder doubted his ears for a moment.'What did he just say?'\"I think\u2026 I misheard something.\"\"It seems like you heard it right.\"\"Spend the night together? What do you mean?\"\"Literally. Status and walls become meaningless in bed. It's a good way to improve our relationship. Or\u2026 perhaps you've never spent the night with someone at your age?\"That was surprising. Kishiar looked Yuder up and down. It was an act that, had the other person been anyone but Kishiar La Orr, could have provoked a physical response.Barely suppressing his urge, Yuder gritted his teeth. His head was spinning.'Kishiar La Orr. What on earth\u2026'Yuder's shock wasn't merely because his superior, of noble standing, proposed a deeply personal relationship for a trivial reason.'...I can't believe I'm hearing this kind of proposition again in my life.'A fragment of a past conversation fluttered up in Yuder's eyes:...Now that things have come to this, what can we do? I value your abilities and have no intention of discarding them. Isn't it okay if we just share the night when needed?......'Damn!'With the curse swallowed back into his mouth, the memory from the past dissipated.He thought he would never hear those words again. Wasn't that why he had built up walls?But Kishiar, whom he had met again after a long time since he had killed him with his own hands, never acted as Yuder had anticipated.Yuder looked at the handsome face of the nobleman of Imperial lineage, who was seriously proposing a relationship of sharing nights with a man from humble origins.It wasn't good.Perhaps the present situation was even worse than before. At least in the past, there had been an unavoidable circumstance that had changed their relationship. But that wasn't the case now.His goal had simply been to become a subordinate close enough to give simple advice. Where on earth had he gone wrong?'No, it's not over yet. It's not too late. What he just said was merely a probe.'With a deep breath, Yuder calmed his shock. It seemed unbelievable that a proposal to share a bed and a proposal to become the deputy commander could be in the same context... but if it was Kishiar, it was possible. He was someone who could do just that.'Let's just take it as him expressing his interest to that extent.'\"I can't,\" Yuder flatly refused. It was a rare spectacle for a commoner like Yuder, a mere member of the unit, to outright refuse the most personal proposal from Kishiar La Orr.\"Why? Are you the type who can't accept such a relationship between men? Or are you a devout follower of the Sun God? Or, did you leave a lover back home?\"\"Do you think there has to be a reason?\"If Kishiar, a nobleman, a duke, and a commander of the Cavalry, was trying to take a commoner man by leveraging his power and position, it might be understandable. But that wasn't the case.\"Even if it's just once?\"\"I refuse.\"\"Quite firm.\"Fortunately, Kishiar did not push further. It meant he had proposed without attributing any significant meaning to physicality.'But he's clearly aware that others could interpret the proposal as meaningful.'That made it even more repugnant. No matter how talented and visionary he was, Kishiar La Orr was an enigma. It had always been that way.\"I quite liked your face and body, too bad.\"\"If you don't want me to voluntarily quit, please stop.\"Yuder decided not to beat around the bush any longer. Kishiar chuckled lazily.\"I can't do that. But if you ever change your mind, you can always tell me.\"A long sigh escaped involuntarily.He spoke well for an Alpha drawn only to Omegas.While it wasn't widely known, Kishiar La Orr was an Alpha. Although they could mate with Betas or other genders, most Alphas felt a distinct desire only for Omegas.In other words, Kishiar, an Alpha, should not have felt a desire for Yuder, who had not manifested a second gender...Upon this thought, Yuder decided to shift the topic in that direction.\"Rather than such talk, how about considering potential issues related to second genders that might arise among Awakeners?\"It wasn't a problem that had clearly emerged yet, so he couldn't speak definitively. Yuder had intended to speak of a problem that might arise, and barely managed to rephrase it, finding the whole situation challenging.\"Problems related to the second gender?\"Kishiar tilted his head slightly, as if asking if there was such a thing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"What are you referring to?\"\"I've heard that those who manifested second genders periodically emit a scent from their bodies both during and after it manifested.\"Emitting a scent from their bodies. It was a roundabout way of saying they were in heat.\"It hasn't happened in our Cavalry yet, but wouldn't accidents occur if they are in close proximity during such periods? As a place where the awakeners gather, I believe it's an issue you should consider, Commander, for the sake of the future.\"Furthermore, it was absolutely necessary to establish a system quickly for organizations with a particularly high ratio of awakeners, like this Southern Army, and for the sake of the country where more and more awakeners would live together in the future.'In the past, laws could only be established after numerous accidents had occurred.'Two years had passed since the Red Stone fell, and until now, the number of awakeners had not been that great. However, as time went on, the number of awakeners steadily increased, and the types of abilities diversified. Along with this, the number of those who manifested second genders also increased, leading to many accidents due to unavoidable reasons.A considerable amount of time was needed for people to recognize and familiarize themselves with a new phenomenon and find a way to cope with it. The same went for those who manifested second genders.The notion that those who manifested a second gender must be separated from people for a while. That one should not carelessly encounter Alphas or Omegas in heat. Even such basic information was unknown to everyone at this point.Normally, someone would have to suffer for such information to be gradually disseminated, but Yuder didn't like that.\"Accidents caused by the manifestation of second genders... That's a valid point.\"\"If there are no rules when an incident occurs and requires handling... it will be too late.\"It must be designated as early as possible. When the Cavalry was newly formed and everything was still possible, and when there was no one to threaten Kishiar's position.\"Understood. I was in the process of creating internal regulations with the help of jurists anyway, so there will be no problem adding this. I'll take it into consideration.\"\"Thank you.\"\"But how did you, a non-manifested, think this far?\"He couldn't reply that it was because he was the one who would manifest as an Omega in the future, so Yuder lied.\"I heard about these things before joining the Cavalry, so I wanted to propose it.\"\"I see.\"No matter how smart Kishiar La Orr was, he couldn't deduce the absurd truth that Yuder had memories of the future. Kishiar easily accepted Yuder's answer.\"We've come this far while talking. It's late, let's meet tomorrow.\"While they were conversing, they had unknowingly returned to the place where they first met.Glancing up at the starry sky and estimating the time by the position of the moon, Kishiar turned away even before receiving Yuder's farewell.He was refreshingly indifferent, not the type of person who would suggest spending the night together.Yuder watched silently until his figure completely disappeared into the darkness.------The Red Stone fell from the sky one day. Some thought it was a message from God to humans, while others believed it was a stone that flew in from another world. Yuder was neither of these.\"Evidence is clear. Or, I can only believe what I see with my own eyes.\" That was his principle.So, it wasn't strange that he had a different thought in front of the Red Stone the next day, an anomaly he had witnessed and experienced firsthand.'Could it really be an object that came flying from another world?'\"Yuder, what's wrong?\"Gakane, who stood by Yuder's side, asked with a concerned look in his eyes.\"Are you affected by the energy the stone is emitting?\"\"No.\"He no longer cared about the energy that the Red Stone emitted. Although the air became heavier and his skin tingled as he approached the stone that day, it was considerably less intense than the previous day.It wasn't only Yuder who had become accustomed; Kanna, who had barely managed to reach this distance yesterday, seemed much calmer today.'She seemed to blame herself quite a bit for being unable to help yesterday. There was no need to worry.'Kanna had been gloomy all the way back to their lodgings yesterday. Despite her lack of combat abilities, they had gone to great lengths to bring her here, yet she hadn't been of any help when they needed her most. It was understandable.But, considering her arm might have disappeared if she had touched the stone, rather than just Gakane's shadow, it was fortunate for the others that she hadn't.'The issue today isn't the tingling energy... it's the stone itself.'The reason for Yuder's seriousness was simple: his attempts to move the Red Stone had all failed.Before coming here today, Yuder had cut out a piece of an extra blanket back at their lodgings and put it into a small bag. His original plan was to apply his power to the stone, forming it into a sphere of dirt and ice as he did yesterday, and then attempt to make contact by covering it with the cloth.But the moment he faced the Red Stone again, he remembered something he hadn't tried yesterday.If the Red Stone belonged to the natural world of this realm, it wouldn't reject his touch. The ability to freely manipulate all natural attributes and the materials born from them was perhaps the most necessary power for transporting the stone.So, Yuder secretly tried to use his power on the stone itself, not the earth beneath it. But the stone didn't move a bit.It was fortunate that he didn't cause an energy explosion like the Eldore siblings who had tried to use their power on the Red Stone yesterday, but there was no reaction at all.Yuder's power couldn't directly affect things not born in this world, like monsters, for example.When he tried to use his power against those creatures, known to be born in places where the world's mana was distorted, nothing happened, just like now.Of course, it didn't matter since he could attack indirectly, but it was a problem that he had a weak reaction to things like ropes made from monster tendons or alcohol mixed with monster blood.In the future that only remained in Yuder's memory, there was a law prohibiting Awakeners from using their powers around the World Sphere. So, he never thought to try moving something directly in this way, and he regretted it now.'Well, knowing that my power doesn't work doesn't mean I've found a better way to move the stone...'Still, he was now free to try indirect methods without hesitation.'Let's watch what Kishiar does and then try to help.'Kishiar had brought a relatively light yet sturdy wooden box and a large shovel to the site today. Of course, the knights had handled the transportation, but now, at the edge of the vast pit, he was the one holding the shovel.\"Well, let's try digging a bit.\"Kishiar, who had placed the box next to the Red Stone, slowly picked up the shovel and approached.\"Captain, are you sure you want to do this alone?\"\"Yes.\"Gakane looked at the large shovel in Kishiar's hand as if it were a massive weapon. It seemed unthinkable to him to have the highest-ranking among them do such work, but Kishiar was adamant.'I am best suited for this task, considering what happened yesterday. It would be absurd if I did nothing while my subordinates worked hard, wouldn't it?'Gakane could say nothing against Kishiar, who stood firm with such resolve.\"Yuder, be ready to erect a protective barrier immediately if you sense anything strange, like yesterday.\"\"Yes.\"\"Then, I'll start digging.\"Without hesitation, Kishiar plunged the shovel into the ground next to the Red Stone. At that moment, Yuder noticed a shimmering energy from Kishiar's hand, narrowing his eyes.'Is it an enhancement ability?'The shovel, sinking into the ground with a sound like settling dust, paused for a moment. Kishiar stood still, seemingly scrutinizing the Red Stone for any anomalies. Then, in a single swift motion, he dug up the Red Stone and swept it into the box.\"Ah!\"The Eldore siblings screamed in unison. Kanna also shrunk back, seemingly anticipating something to happen. From Gakane's feet, his shadow clone swiftly rose.\"...\"And nothing happened in the box.\"It seems we're in the clear.\"Everyone stared at the box with puzzled expressions. The only ones who remained composed were Kishiar and Yuder.With a relieved look on his face, Yuder turned to Kishiar, who was handing the shovel to Gakane, and spoke.\"It seems that as long as we don't touch it directly, we're safe. That's fortunate. Shall we fill it with water and freeze it to prevent it from moving around inside?\"\"Can you do that?\"\"I can also melt it instantly if needed.\"\"Hmm... No, I'd like to see that, but not now. The water created by your ability might trigger a reaction from the stone like yesterday.\"Despite being inside a box, the Red Stone was still a red stone. It soon became clear that General Gino, a Swordmaster, and the Peletta knights could not approach the box at a certain distance.Hence, it was decided that the box containing the Red Stone would be kept in Kishiar's private quarters.\"Yuder Aile, carry the box and follow me. Everyone else, return to your quarters. After resting tonight, we will depart for the capital tomorrow. That's all.\"Yuder complied with Kishiar's orders and cradled the box containing the Red Stone. While it wasn't heavy, the energy emanating from the box still made his body feel heavy, and his skin prickled just as before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I'm glad it ended quickly.\"\"Thanks to you, our Southern Army will be able to leave this place for the first time in two years.\"\"I'm sure you must be happy to regain your freedom after a few months.\"Hearing Kishiar's casual response, a faint smile appeared on General Gino's face. He had always seemed so serious that it was surprising to see that even he had grown tired of this place.\"But, it's strange that the stone threatens to explode if touched by a person, but is fine when placed in an object. How did you guess that?\"\"I think it's not exactly about human touch that makes it explode.\"For a moment, Kishiar's gaze turned toward the box held by Yuder.\"It's still a hypothesis, but I think the likely trigger is Awakeners, like me or the Cavalry members I brought. It reacts to direct contact and to the use of abilities.\"\"I see. So that's why you decided to move it with a shovel and a box, which have no connection with the Awakeners.\"While stroking his chin, lost in thought, General Gino asked Kishiar another question after a moment's pause.\"Then, it's possible that those of us who have not gained power from the Red Stone, like me, might not cause it to explode if we touched it. What do you think?\"\"Maybe. But what does it matter? Ordinary people can touch it but can't approach it, and the Awakeners can approach but not touch it directly. The best option was to shovel it into the box. Fortunately, it worked.\"\"Quite strange.\"General Gino slightly furrowed his brow. He looked at the box containing the Red Stone as if it were a magic bomb ready to explode at the slightest touch.\"General. We will leave early tomorrow morning. As previously discussed, the withdrawal of the Southern Army stationed here should commence once you receive the signal that we have arrived at the capital.\"\"Understood.\"\"Try to skip the greetings tomorrow as well. It could draw unnecessary attention.\"Upon hearing Kishiar say that he would even skip greetings, General Gino let out a sigh.\"You say we may not see each other again once we part, but you want to leave without even saying goodbye to this old general?\"\"Haha. Wasn't playing dozens of strategy games with you over the past two days for this very moment?\"\"Considering we haven't seen each other in years, it's only right that you do at least that much.\"Despite not appearing to be significantly older, General Gino's gaze towards Kishiar was as affectionate as a grandfather looking at his grandson.Yuder suddenly remembered that the reputedly upright and reticent General Gino had never had children, having devoted his life to the way of the sword.\"We've arrived, so let's go into our quarters.\"Not long after, Kishiar's quarters, located on the outskirts of the village, came into view. Unlike the other relatively shabby houses, it was a beautiful mansion, properly constructed with bricks.Yuder was a bit surprised to find such a lodging in this place, but he guessed it was probably a summer villa built by someone in the past.\"Always take care of your health, Your Majesty.\"\"I'm always healthy. Aren't you due for retirement soon, General? Do patrol the border areas moderately and come to Peletta after you retire.\"\"You always speak so sweetly.\"General Gino bowed his head with a laugh, said his farewells, and turned to leave. Yuder also bowed his head towards him, but as expected, there was no response to a mere soldier like him. Yuder quietly watched the General's figure as it quickly receded into the distance.This time, there was no opportunity for him to have a personal conversation with the General. But he wasn't disappointed. It was enough to know that Kishiar was considering inviting the retired General to his side.Their relationship seemed deeper than he had expected, so as long as Kishiar was alive, there would undoubtedly be another opportunity to meet in the future.\"Don't feel left out. The General is older than he looks. He still doesn't fully understand the value of the Awakeners.\"Thinking Yuder might be upset about the General's indifference, Kishiar quietly initiated the conversation. Yuder didn't immediately understand what he meant, blinked in confusion, then nodded in realization.\"I'm not upset. Rather, if he showed too much interest, it would have been burdensome.\"He was sincere. How much attention could someone like General Gino, who had lived high up for a long time, show to a greenhorn like himself who had just joined the cavalry?In his eyes, the members of the Cavalry were no different from the common soldiers that populated the Southern Army.They might be interesting because of their unique abilities, but that was about it. There was no reason at all to treat them as equals to someone like Kishiar, whom he had watched since his young prince days.Yuder never for a moment fooled himself into thinking that his status had elevated simply because he had joined the Cavalry and received a title.\"I like that you're consistent.\"Kishiar chuckled and opened the door. The unusually high, arched wooden door was heavy enough to be hard to open even with both hands, but Kishiar easily opened it with one hand.\"Now, let's go in.\"Kishiar, who had opened the unusually high, arched entrance door with one hand, gestured for them to go inside.It was a completely different behavior from when he was walking elegantly with General Gino.\"...Where should I put the box?\"\"Just put it anywhere nearby. You'll have to come back and get it tomorrow anyway.\"Normally, the knights of Peletta would have taken care of it, but they couldn't even approach the box containing the Red Stone. The reason they had decided to follow at a distance from the Cavalry on the way back tomorrow was also due to this.Yuder set the box down under a pillar's shadow, where it wasn't very noticeable inside the entrance. As he moved away from the box, his skin felt significantly less prickly.\"Then, I'll be heading back.\"\"You've worked hard carrying it all the way here, it would be quite heartless of me to just let you go. At least have a cup of tea before you leave.\"\"No, I'll be......\"\"Don't tell me you're planning to heartlessly reject the request of a leader who has spent two whole nights without an adjutant? Even so, that would be going too far. I believe that Yuder Aile, who deeply cares for his fellow Awakener, wouldn't do such a thing.\"\u2018Since when did you know that?\u2019Before Yuder could reject the idea, Kishiar had already made the first move. He had lit a fire in the magic-stone stove of the mansion's parlor. A handful of magic stones thrown in crackled as they burned, quickly illuminating the room and filling it with warmth.As the room brightened, the summer-mansion-style interior of the house became visible to Yuder.When the fire was out, he thought the place was too old and decrepit for anyone to stay alone, but it was not the case.Though not luxurious, the interior was cozy, and the emblem of the aristocratic family who were the original owners was engraved in various places. The emblem was a long-tailed blue bird next to a shield.\"You won't have many opportunities to drink tea that I've personally prepared. Are you still leaving?\"Despite having stayed here for only two nights, Kishiar moved as freely as if he were the original owner.Yuder watched as he filled the empty teapot with water, placed it on the stove, and scooped tea leaves from a shelf onto it. His movements were as fluid as flowing water.\"...\"Finally, Yuder sighed and sat in the chair Kishiar pointed to in front of the stove. Not long after, steam rose from the teapot, and a savory, aromatic scent tickled his nose. Kishiar poured the hot water into two tea cups he had brought from somewhere and set them on the table.\"You don't seem surprised. Usually, people are surprised when I do this.\"How regrettable it was that he couldn't respond that he had drunk this tea many times in the past.Swallowing a fragment of an old memory, Yuder shook his head.\"I am surprised, in my own way.\"\"You don't look like it.\"\"That's just my face.\"A grim expressionless face. Emotionless, chilling eyes. A pallid, sallow face like a corpse's. These were common remarks Yuder had heard about his face since long ago.\"There's no one who's naturally like that. Anyone can learn to have a brighter expression. How about practicing in front of a mirror? I can help if you want.\"\"...That won't be necessary.\"\"No need to refuse.\"Why on earth was he having this ridiculous conversation with Kishiar? Despite his resolve not to be swayed, Yuder found himself startled to realize that he was responding dutifully to his absurd comments.'I can't afford to let my guard down.'\"How is the tea?\"Previously, Yuder had left without drinking the tea that Kishiar's adjutant, Nathan, had brewed at the Cavalry barracks. This time, he couldn't. As he lifted the tea cup with a feeling of lifting a heavy stone and moistened his lips, Kishiar asked as if he had been waiting.\"I'm from a peasant background, so I don't really know the taste of such fine things.\"\"So you mean you don't want to talk. Still, finish your tea.\"Kishiar hit a nerve, and Yuder was momentarily at a loss for words.\"...That's not what I meant.\"\"I was just kidding.\"Knowing it yet being struck by the other person's words wasn't a pleasant feeling. Feeling a slight headache, Yuder decided to finish his tea as quickly as possible.\"Yuder. How was it while you were carrying the box?\"But before he could take a sip, Kishiar started talking again. From his gaze, Yuder had a hunch that this was going to be the main point.\"What do you mean by 'how was it'?\"\"When you first saw the stone yesterday and when you carried it in the box today. Didn't you feel any difference in the energy emanating from the stone, being so close to it?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was only then that Yuder understood that Kishiar's order to bring the box had not been thoughtless.'Come to think of it.'He recalled thinking that he had grown somewhat accustomed to the energy emanating from the Red Stone more than he had been the day before. He hadn't even had a conversation with Gakane.Could it be that he hadn't just become accustomed to it?\"\u2026I thought I had grown more accustomed to the energy it was emitting than yesterday.\"\"It's not that you've become accustomed to it, but the Red Stone has weakened.\"Kishiar's response was succinct.\"The energy it was emitting has diminished a bit today. Don't you notice?\"Yuder suddenly turned his head to look at the box he had placed behind the pillar. He could not see the Red Stone inside, but the energy it was emitting was still perceptible. A strange energy that made the surroundings feel heavy and tingling, like being deep underwater.If, as Kishiar said, it had diminished slightly from yesterday, there had to be a reason. Was there a plausible cause?'...Could it be?'\"Is it because of the explosions that occurred yesterday? Because of the energy that escaped from the Red Stone?\"Yuder ventured to speak, his voice filled with uncertainty.\"I think that's likely the case. There's no other explanation.\"A satisfied smile crossed Kishiar's face, as if he were speaking with a conversational partner who understood him well.\"Yuder, you're clever enough to understand what that implies, aren't you?\"\"...The energy contained within that stone is not infinite.\"\u2018Bingo.\u2019 Even without Kishiar's response, Yuder understood what he had been trying to say. He tried to suppress his astonishment.He had never heard such information in the last eleven years. Compared to the Red Stone, the World Sphere was a mere shell, its power nearly depleted. And it was impossible to recover what had already been lost.But if, as Kishiar and his conjectures suggested, the tremendous power emitted by the Red Stone was not infinite but finite, like water in a jar, then that would mean\u2026'Could the purification work done in the Pearl Tower in the past have been an attempt to separate the power of that stone?'Back then, he had thought that the mages, consumed by their research, were simply destroying and shaving away at the stone, causing all its inherent power to scatter.But what if that had been intentional? What if someone had tried to forcibly separate the power within it, just like Yuder of the past who wanted to possess the power within the stone...?'...That's too much of a speculation at this point.'Yuder tried to suppress his complicated thoughts, listening to Kishiar's continuing words.\"The energy contained in that stone is completely different from any mana that has ever existed. It's so remarkable that it can influence humans by its mere presence. We need to be particularly careful to ensure that none of it leaks out during transportation. Do you understand what I'm saying?\"\"...I'll relay this to the others when we return.\"The Awakeners, unable to directly touch the stone, would protect it as they returned to the capital. Although it sounded easy, Yuder remembered a slight 'accident' that had occurred during this task in the past.The very accident that became the catalyst for Kishiar to draw the divine sword and announce himself as its new master to the world.Baseless rumors and the Imperial family's downsized official statements. With time, the individuals involved had become nearly impossible to find, and the information Yuder managed to gather about the incident wasn't much. After all, no one who could detail exactly what transpired then remained.But it was beyond doubt that during that time, Kishiar and his party had engaged in a battle of such magnitude that he had to draw his divine sword against some adversaries.When did that battle occur? It was highly likely to have happened quite a while after they had departed from this place, which was guarded by countless soldiers.'It's tricky. The stone would limit or slow our movement, and the Peletta Knights would follow from a distance. If someone attacks us in a situation where the group is separated...'Yuder furrowed his brows after thinking that far.\"Do you suppose we might be ambushed on our return, Commander?\"Indeed. As soon as Kishiar had retrieved the Red Stone, he planned to return to the capital as quickly as possible. He even declared that he would leave without bidding farewell to General Gino, whom he had known for a long time, and ordered not to disband the Southern Army, which had been safeguarding this place for so long.'Kishiar ordering to move only after the news of his return to the capital is spread means we need even more stringent security than when we came here.'However, if the same event that happened in the future were to occur this time, Yuder had to understand Kishiar's intentions beforehand and instill a stronger sense of caution in him.\"Nathan didn't explain it before we came here? Always be wary of the unexpected. After all, everyone in the world knows that the stone is here.\"\"\u2026Yes.\"\"The reason no one coveted the stone, even though everyone knew it was here, was because no one had found or attempted a way to touch the stone. But things have changed now.\"Fortunately, Kishiar had a proper sense of caution.\"We must return to the capital as quickly as possible. I'm counting on your remarkable abilities should anything happen.\"\"\u2026Understood.\"Good. He had eagerly taken up the duty of protecting the Red Stone that Kishiar had outright entrusted to him. It was what he originally wanted, so he was quite pleased.'Even if attackers show up as they did before, as Kishiar said, this time I'm here.'So, he would minimize Kishiar's need to step in. Absolutely.Yuder planned to gather the remaining Cavalry members as soon as they returned and prepare how to act in case of an emergency.He had to get going since there was no time to lose.\"I enjoyed the tea. I'll head back first.\"Yuder drained the remaining tea in one gulp and rose from his seat. Kishiar then opened his mouth with a dissatisfied look.\"You shouldn't gulp down tea all at once\u2026\u2026.\"Crash!Just then, something flew past his head with the sound of shattering glass, crashing into the magic stone heater. A dense smoke spread, and a chilling, intense murderous aura targeted Yuder.'An intruder!'Yuder immediately cast a wide water barrier around himself and Kishiar.With a 'puff' sound, something was felt rebounding off a barrier. Then something else flew towards it but was likewise repelled.\"What the hell is this!\"A bewildered deep voice echoed.'They must be new to something like this. They're not professional killers, it seems.'Many had laughingly considered his water-made wall to be weak. However, what Yuder had created was different. He could instantly freeze the water to be as solid as steel and then melt it again. That was the main reason why he often used water for defense.'It seems like several people have entered, but it's too dark to see ahead. For now, let's deal with this darkness...'If he were to reveal all his abilities, he could just summon dozens of flames to push back the darkness, but he couldn't do that. Yuder paused to think for a moment, then removed the barrier in front of him.'If there's any guy with a sword, I should take it and use it.'The magic stone heater had shattered, and smoke had exploded, making the interior as dark as pitch-black. However, to the focused Yuder, the positions of those inside felt distinctly clear.\"Commander, please stay still for now.\"Worried that Kishiar might try to grab the divine sword, Yuder advised him and then lightly waved his hand. If there was a steel sword in the place, it would respond to his power, escaping from its owner's hand and flying towards him.\"Uh! What, what is this!\"Soon, one of the enemies not far away let out a bewildered sound. The sword that flew through the darkness landed in Yuder's hand. Yuder immediately gripped it and infused it with his power.With the sound of a soft roar, flames climbing the blade quickly illuminated the smoke-filled darkness, revealing the surrounding scenery.The interior was a mess due to the shattered magic stone stove, and several masked men appeared, not knowing what to do. Kishiar was also seen inside the barrier, his face as usual.'Good. The box containing the red stone...'He glanced at the box that was still lying there, unnoticed by anyone. It was a relief.\"Who the hell are you guys?\"Yuder opened his mouth with a more relaxed attitude.'The Red Stone makes it inaccessible to ordinary people. Considering they got in... they must all be Awakeners. I wonder who sent them.'\"Where's the Red Stone?\"A man standing at the front of the masked people growled in a low voice.\"Hand it over quietly. If you don't want to die.\"\"Are all of you Awakeners? Who sent you?\"\"We're the ones asking the questions, not you.\"Due to the energy emitted by the Red Stone, the air enveloping the entire mansion was very heavy. If they knew that the energy became stronger as it approached the stone, they could track its location without asking, but the enemies were unaware of this.'They know that the stone is here, but they don't know its characteristics... It's safe to say that there wasn't a traitor among those involved in the recovery operation.'Even though Yuder had lit the darkness with a flame-wrapped sword, its range wasn't very wide. It was fortunate that he had pushed the box containing the red stone behind an inconspicuous pillar.'I need to uncover the mastermind, so I shouldn't kill them. And Kishiar might go for the divine sword, so I should prevent that in advance.'The tingling energy emitted by the Red Stone wasn't good for either Yuder or Kishiar, but it was the same for the enemies. Besides, no matter how much Yuder had returned to his state from 11 years ago, he was not so weak as to lose to these enemies.Having made his decision, Yuder looked back at Kishiar and spoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The area within the wall is safe, so all you need to do is watch, Commander.\"\"Are you sure you can manage alone? From what I can see, there are at least ten of them.\"Kishiar asked, glancing at the enemies with a look of interest. Like Yuder, he showed no signs of tension.\"No problem.\"His casual tone, as if saying two plus two equals four, momentarily disrupted the enemies' murderous intent.\"Are you unable to grasp the situation? If you're choosing death...!\"'Does he sound like someone ready to die?'Yuder shook his head at the masked figure. He sighed at the thought of having to expend energy against these people, who couldn't even properly assess his abilities.\"It's you who fail to understand the situation. You know the Red Stone is here, but you seem unaware of its nature - that it explodes the moment it comes into contact with an Awakener's body or abilities. If you falter, touching it could be fatal.\"\"What did you say?\"Of course, Yuder had no intention of wasting the limited power held by the Red Stone in such a way. However, the enemies would not know this and would likely flinch even if they believed his words to be nonsense. In a battle between Awakeners, the one unable to fully use their abilities was at a distinct disadvantage.\"If you think we'll back down just because of that...!\"\"Should I show you whether it's true or not? All we need to do is set up a defensive wall.\"As if to make a point, Yuder moved his flame-encircled sword. The sight of the dancing flames caused tension to flicker across the enemies' faces.They didn't know what abilities he had, but anyone who could easily snatch a sword, create a water barrier, and use flames while doing so was no less than a legendary mage. It was an incredible power.\"...What should we do?\"\"Even so, we can't back down. It's a bluff.\"Among the enemies, the one who seemed to be thinking the most called out loudly enough for the others to hear.\"No one knows we're here. He's just buying time. You'd better discard any hope that someone will come to help. If you want to lessen your suffering...\"\"Goodness. Even when I explain kindly, you talk too much.\"Before the enemy could finish his words, Yuder slightly swung his sword upward. Instantly, the flames surrounding the blade shot up like a pillar.Boom!It was a small pillar of fire, but its power was undeniable. The flame that pierced the ceiling and roof illuminated the night sky for a moment before disappearing. It was powerful enough for those far away to sense something unusual and rush over.\"...\"\"Now everyone should know you're here.\"Looking at the remnants of the fire falling from the sky through the shattered window, Yuder chuckled. The dumbstruck looks on the enemies' faces were quite amusing.\"And what was it you said? 'If you want to lessen your suffering?'\"Through the gaps in their masks, he could see their eyes trembling.\"I suggest you start hoping your suffering will lessen.\"\"Damn it. Everyone, attack at once!\"As the enemies rushed at him all at once, Yuder swung his outstretched arm.'If you wanted to overpower us, you should have attacked the moment you broke in.'Upon hearing Yuder's words, the enemies knew they couldn't fully utilize their abilities. After all, they didn't know the exact location of the Red Stone. But Yuder was the opposite.Even a mere graze from his flame-engulfed sword sent the enemies screaming and collapsing. A normal sword might cause minimal damage with a slight cut, but when fire seeped into the wound, it was a different story.The flames rapidly penetrated the wound, immediately spreading throughout the victim's body.'Fortunately, they're all physical enhancement types.'There was no one more familiar with the battles between Awakeners in the current world than Yuder. Those who strengthened their bodies appeared strong in close combat due to their high offensive power, but their defensive power was weak.Even if they could enhance their skin, it wasn't invincible. Even the most conditioned individuals struggled to enhance softer parts of their bodies from the get-go, like the inside of their mouths or their eyeballs.Yuder dodged a punch thrown by someone whose skin was as hard as stone and gently jabbed his sword into the opponent's eye before pulling it out.\"Argh!\"When another enemy attacked with nails elongated like a sword, Yuder momentarily erected a small ice wall, seizing the moment of hesitation to slash at their side. The burning smell accompanied the transfer of fire to the body.Someone hurled a spell, but since it was ultimately made of metal, it was enough to direct it towards the ground, and he even managed to redirect a few back at their casters.\"Aargh!\"It took Yuder less than a few minutes to take down more than ten enemies. The mansion was filled with individuals who were scorched black and writhing in agony, unable to die.\"The wall will now be dismissed since it's over.\"\"Very well.\"Yuder nonchalantly passed by these individuals, looking out through the broken window. He could see the torches carried by those rushing toward them from not too far away.\"Fortunately, no one has escaped.\"Fearing that delaying would allow someone to escape, he resolved the situation as quickly as possible. He couldn't afford to let information about the Red Stone leak out.Once Yuder verified the outside, he approached the pillar holding the Red Stone and brought the box containing it. Kishiar accepted it.'Now then... shall we check the mastermind behind this?'The moment Kishiar retrieved the stone, he eyed his private quarters. The enemy's intrusion was completely unexpected.'I thought they would come after I left this place.'The fact that so many had invaded meant that the enemy had prepared for this operation for a long time and had underestimated Kishiar.In other words, the enemy wasn't someone who knew about Kishiar's power.Had they been waiting for such a moment in the past? If so, it would make sense even if Kishiar had dealt with them wielding the divine sword.Yuder checked the faces of the ones still breathing. Out of the thirteen, eight were dead, and five were still alive.\"Your Grace!\"\"Commander!\"While Yuder extinguished the fire on the bodies of the living and gathered them in one place, the sound of General Gino and the Cavalry members' voices came as the door shattered.\"Your Grace, it's Gino. Are you all right?\"\"There was an intrusion, but it was quickly suppressed. I'm fine, so be at ease.\"At Kishiar's leisurely response, General Gino seemed to calm down.\u201cDue to the box, I cannot reach you. I will send someone.\u201dMoments later, the Cavalry members passed through the corridor and entered the reception room. Their eyes, filled with urgency as they hastily put on their uniforms, turned to horror upon seeing the several bodies lying on the floor.\u201cMy goodness. What in the world\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come any closer, Kanna.\u201dAlthough they were dead, one could never be too cautious. Yuder had Kanna, who lacked combat abilities, step back and then looked at Kishiar. As if waiting, Kishiar opened his mouth.\u201cThese five are still alive, so I plan to interrogate them immediately. This place is messy, so let's move them to the next room.\u201d\u201cThe next room\u2026you say?\u201dGakane swallowed nervously and asked.\u201cUnderstood. But who exactly sent these people?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to find out now.\u201dYuder's calm response cast a cold atmosphere over the room, which was broken by Kishiar's low chuckle.\u201cYes, we\u2019ll find out now.\u201dGakane's shadow clone carried out the task of moving the intruders to the next room. The shadow clone, carrying all five people at once, strode into the room and threw them down.\u201cKanna, Gakane, you two stand guard outside the room and make sure no one enters. Move the dead ones outside. The rest, come inside.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Kishiar's simple command, everyone moved swiftly and efficiently. Yuder closed the door after making sure Eldore siblings, and Kishiar had all entered the room, preventing any sounds from escaping.\u201cNow then.\u201dKishiar approached the groaning men, his relaxed smile gone. His cold, red eyes bore into the enemies.\u201cWho sent you? Answer me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlthough they were clearly alive, the enemies did not answer. Kishiar turned his head quietly and looked at the Eldore siblings, who stepped forward.\u201cSo, we just need to make them talk, right?\u201d\u201cLeave it to us.\u201dThe Eldore sibling\u2019s specialty wasn\u2019t their mobility, but their extraordinary physical enhancement abilities. Although there were many people with abilities to strengthen their bodies, the Eldore siblings\u2019 abilities were quite exceptional.As they stepped forward with their innocent faces, the siblings smiled, and their once slender arms and legs began to swell.With thumping and ripping sounds, their clothes were torn apart without mercy. The enemies, who had been firmly clenching their mouths shut, began to tremble uncontrollably.Moments later, two massive figures with rock-solid muscles stood where the Eldore siblings had been. It was the transformed Eldore siblings, their power activated.\u2018Remarkable, every time I see it.\u2019Yuder thought that their ability was incredibly visually striking, as he looked at the cute faces attached to the grotesquely swollen bodies.With their childlike innocence intact, their bodies had transformed like giants, causing most enemies to lose their will to fight and flee as if they had encountered a massive monster. The enemies before them seemed no different.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Or perhaps the toes?\"\"I prefer toes.\"\"Fine. Let's crush the toes first.\"\"W-wait.\"One of the enemies tried to crawl backwards, bowing his head. But Finn's foot moved faster.\"I'll talk. I'll talk... Wait! Aaaaagh!\"Thud. Finn stepped on the enemy's leg and a crumbling sound echoed.\"I'll... I'll talk...!\"\"Hold on, wait...!\"The enemies gasped for air in unison, but Kishiar simply laughed and didn't stop the Eldore siblings.Then, inside the room, the thumping sound of earth-shattering and faint screams reverberated.\"Ugh... ugh...!\"\"So, ready to talk now?\"Kishiar casually asked again, looking at the enemies covered in burns, their faces wet with tears and snot.\"You attempted to assassinate a member of the imperial family. Your lives are already forfeit. Isn't it better to die cleanly than to be dragged off to the Pearl Tower for experimentation?\"\"It might be more effective to say you'll spare the first one who talks.\"Finn Eldore, back in his original form, suggested another method, tilting his head. Yuder also thought his method was much better.\"Really? Well then....\"\"We, we wrote an... oath....\"Before Kishiar could finish, one of the fallen enemies murmured.\"We agreed... not to talk... so I can't...\"\"An oath?\"A peculiar look crossed Kishiar's red eyes.What they were talking about was probably similar to the magic oath that the Cavalry had used to promise not to disclose any information about the Red Stone retrieval mission.Oaths were expensive and were rarely used except when those with considerable power were assigning important missions. Furthermore, they were not readily sold to just anyone.This meant that the person who hired them had significant power. Kishiar, his eyes narrowed, turned towards Yuder.\"Yuder, keep this for a moment.\"He handed a box containing the Red Stone to Yuder and approached the fallen ones.'What is he trying to do?'Yuder watched him curiously. Kishiar was known to have great physical abilities, as far as Yuder knew.Breaking the power of an oath was not impossible, but it was known to be feasible only for high-ranking mages or priests.\"Keep what you've just seen a secret.\"Kishiar turned to the Eldore siblings and Yuder, winked playfully, and extended his hand. Then a white light emanated from his fingertips, enveloped them, and faded after a moment.'...Is that divine power?'Yuder, who always maintained his composure, was momentarily taken aback. If his eyes weren't deceiving him, what he just saw was undoubtedly the power used by the priests of the Sun God to purge impurities.\"It's a useless power passed down through the blood. I never thought I'd use it like this.\"The Eldore siblings, oblivious to all this, showed no reaction, but Yuder was different. The imperial bloodline had divine power? This was something he had never heard of, even when he had served the emperor closely in his previous life.Moreover, Kishiar had never mentioned to him that he had such a power, not even at the moment of his death.\u2018There used to be Awakeners among the priests. But\u2026\u2019Their numbers were too few, and those who did possess powers had abilities that were embarrassingly weak. As a result, the idea that divine power and the power of the Red Stone neutralized each other became accepted as a standard.The fact that there wasn't a single priest-origin Awakener in the Cavalry until Yuder's death added credibility to this notion.However, Kishiar was a powerful individual even among the Awakeners. Moreover, he was acknowledged by the divine sword, which was notoriously selective about its wielders.The individuals the divine sword had chosen as its masters, though not at the time of acceptance, eventually all became sword masters with strength significant enough to make history.There had been no precedent of a sword master becoming an Awakener, but it existed in the future. About a year later, one of the sword masters in a foreign country would awaken, serving as that very example.And while not of the sword master level, there were quite a few instances of strong knights who knew how to use aura becoming Awakeners. So Yuder didn't find it strange that Kishiar, who was acknowledged by the divine sword, had become an Awakener.However, there had never been a case of someone with such strong divine power that they could break the power of the oath becoming a powerful Awakener.If he was deemed worthy of the divine sword's approval, then it was certain that Kishiar had the skill to become a sword master, even if not right now.But on top of that, he possessed such extraordinary divine power that he could forcibly break the power of the oath, and furthermore, he awakened as a powerful Awakener?That was truly an inconceivable matter.Was such a case even possible? Even to Yuder, who could manipulate five attributes at will, it seemed like an absurdly far-fetched idea.To his knowledge, there wasn't a single human who possessed all three aspects: the power of the Awakeners, aura, and divine power. Despite seeing Kishiar use divine power right in front of him, it was still hard to believe.He had assumed that the reason Kishiar, despite having powerful abilities, didn't fully use his power was simply due to his leadership style, prioritizing command. But in truth, he could also use divine power and wanted to keep it a secret?'What could be the reason for wanting to keep it a secret?'If he was hiding such an unparalleled ability, there must be a reason. And perhaps that reason might provide the answer to the questions about Kishiar's death that remained for Yuder.Kishiar La Orr, who at the moment of death, as if he had been waiting for it, quietly accepted everything and did nothing.A duke in name only, unable to vie for the emperor's succession, and a man who had lived a lifelong bachelor. He had always wondered why such a smart and capable individual had accepted his position without vying for the emperor's throne.If Yuder had the same power and had been born a prince, he would never have lived in such obscurity.'When I get back, I'll have to investigate whether divine power truly descends to the imperial bloodline, and how the other dukes of prince origin who lived like Kishiar fared.'While Yuder was lost in thought, Kishiar continued to interrogate the intruders nonchalantly.\"Now, you should be able to talk. Answer me, who sent you?\"\"W-we, we don't exactly, um, know ourselves.\"The intruder answered, gasping in pain.\"We are all mercenaries from different places. Our client never revealed their identity and only contacted us through intermediaries and letters...\"\"Mercenaries?\"The Eldore siblings muttered to each other, glancing at each other's faces. Only then did Yuder stop his thoughts on Kishiar and lift his head.'Not professional assassins, then... I see. They were all mercenaries.'\"You must have heard something from your client beforehand. What did you know when you came here? What were you planning to do after stealing the Red Stone? Or was the Red Stone just an excuse, and the client wanted me killed?\"\"No, no.\"At Kishiar's question, the intruder cried out with a contorted face.\"We're lowlifes, but we know we won't die a decent death if we do such a thing. Assassinating an imperial family member, we wouldn't accept such a request.\"\"How amusing. Assassinating an imperial family member is scary, but stealing the Red Stone is fine?\"When Hinn added her comments as if for the intruders to hear, regret and anger flashed across the bloodied faces of the intruders.\"...The client said there would only be one person, Duke Peletta, staying here. If we timed it right, we could have handled it easily. We didn't think anyone else would be here.\"Fearful eyes discreetly turned towards Yuder. Even without moving a finger, Yuder, as reflected in the intruders' eyes, was as good as a grim reaper.But Yuder was not looking at him. If those words were true, this was no ordinary problem.'The information was completely leaked.'Yuder took a fleeting glance at Kishiar's expressionless face. When was it decided that he would come here to retrieve the Red Stone? Whoever planned this daring act must have accessed that information very early. There was no doubt about it.Furthermore, the fact that the location where Kishiar was staying was reported in real-time meant that the instigator was much closer than expected.\"Seems like they knew this place very well. Was that all the information they gave you?\"At Kishiar's question, the intruders hurriedly responded, each adding a little more information.\"No, at first they just told us to go to the Orr Empire and wait until the messenger arrived.\"\"We waited at the edge of the mountain range for a few days, and then we received a letter yesterday to move here...!\"\"We were told to observe the mansion and if it seemed like the Red Stone had been retrieved, to invade and steal it. We really thought we only had to steal the stone. After retrieving it, we were to return to our original hiding place and wait until the client contacted us...!\"\"A letter that arrived yesterday...\"Kishiar murmured meaningfully, narrowing his eyes. Surely, he must have realized what Yuder was thinking.Even the Cavalry members who came to retrieve the Red Stone in person had only just found out that only the Awakeners could approach the Red Stone.Therefore, the likelihood that the one who sent the intruders knew this fact in advance and gathered only the Awakeners was very low. Yet the fact that they sent only the Awakeners meant they deemed it necessary to have people with powerful abilities.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYuder visualized the unknown client in his mind. A figure of wealth and power, and incredibly meticulous. Likely, the client had chosen to hire mercenaries to ensure that even if the tail was stepped on, no harm would come to them.They had gathered and dispatched over ten Awakeners, probably figuring that would be enough to confront a Kishiar and obtain what they wanted.Had they known the extent of Kishiar's power, they would have realized that a dozen or so were insufficient. However, by sheer coincidence, Yuder's presence at the site was the client's downfall.\"The client had a proxy, you said. How did you contact them?\"\"Th-they were always different people. Moreover, since we entered the Orr Empire, the proxy never appeared in person. It was always through letters...\"\"Naturally, you burned all the letters.\"\"...Yes.\"Kishiar fell silent, seemingly lost in thought. His gaze drifted to the box Yuder held. The box, containing the Red Stone, still radiated a heavy and sharp aura.\"Alright. I'll ask one last thing. If you were successful in retrieving it, where were you planning to take it?\"Where could they hide from the watchful eyes of the numerous Imperial soldiers patrolling the mountains, who had been guarding the Red Stone? Where could these ten or so people be hidden?Everyone's gaze turned to the intruder's mouth.\"That place, it's, from here... uh...uh?\"Suddenly, the man who had been speaking choked and bent over, retching.\"Cough, hack. Urgh, aah!\"The man's body started to swell grotesquely at a rapid pace, turning a violet hue. Seeing his eyes bulging as if they were about to burst, Yuder felt an ominous premonition.\"A barrier!\"Instinctively, he created a barrier of water and air around everyone just as the man's body exploded. A black mass spread in all directions, releasing a toxic energy into the confined space.\"...What on earth happened?\"After the explosion subsided, Finn mumbled, his mouth agape in a daze. The scene that had unfolded was truly horrific. Even the remaining intruders, who had still been alive, were now all dead.The room, from ceiling to floor, had transformed into a terrible sight, melted by the toxic energy. If Yuder had not quickly put up a barrier, they would have shared the same fate.\"What was that noise... Commander! Are you okay?\"Gakane, who had startled and opened the door, was shocked at the sight inside the room.\"I'm fine. Is everyone else alright?\"Even Kishiar looked around with a furrowed brow, seeming surprised by the unexpected event.\"We're fine.\"\"We're okay too.\"After Yuder and the Eldore siblings responded, Kishiar's gaze turned to the box holding the Red Stone. Yuder subtly nodded to confirm that it too was intact. The Red Stone in his hand was safe, and so were his companions.\"That was a close call. I didn't expect they would have laid a double layer of the Oath's prohibition.\"\"The Oath's prohibition? But you said you broke it, Commander.\"\"Yes, I definitely did break one. But I didn't expect that they would use two different types of Oaths.\"At Hinn's question, Kishiar let out a dry chuckle. It wasn't laughter born of genuine amusement, but more of disbelief that their enemy could have gone so far, something they hadn't anticipated.\"Originally, only one oath could be written at a time. But occasionally, there are cases where people use illegally made oaths to impose a double prohibition. The stronger the prohibition becomes, the more terrible the consequences of breaking it, a wicked strategy indeed. We've been outplayed.\"During his time as the commander, Yuder had seen people imposing double prohibitions to control others. Such people usually knew the prohibition imposed on them very well and never dared to speak about it.But those who had just died unexpectedly seemed completely unaware that a double prohibition had been placed on their oath. If they had known, even if Kishiar had used his power to lift the prohibition once, they would not have opened their mouths so easily.'...Did they deliberately create this situation?'The body of the man, shattered into pieces by the swelling prohibition, was saturated with a potent poison, lethal at the slightest touch. If it had grazed his comrades or Kishiar, even if it didn't kill them, it would have caused severe injuries.Yuder felt an astounding, silent malice directed towards Kishiar. Now, with Yuder present, they could fend it off, but what about before his return? Had Kishiar also faced such attacks before, and was he truly unscathed?\"Commander, do you have any suspicion about who might be behind this?\"Yuder asked Kishiar quietly.\"Well...... I'm not sure yet.\"Kishiar shook his head, his expression inscrutable, making it unclear whether he genuinely had no suspicions, or if he had some idea but did not wish to share it with his team.\"Unfortunately, we couldn't find out where they were hiding, so I plan to order General Gino to spread out and search.\"\"Now?\"\"The sooner we find them, the higher the chances of finding traces they didn't manage to erase.\"After saying this, Kishiar looked again at the box quietly nestled in Yuder's embrace.\"However, we should not participate in the search and should leave immediately. Pack up and get ready to move out, despite the fatigue.\"Kishiar seemed to feel strongly that they could no longer remain here. Yuder agreed. It was the middle of the night, and they couldn't move alongside the Peletta Knights, so it would be dangerous, but being away from this place, which was under the unseen gaze of an unknown enemy, might be better.\"Understood.\"The team members, with serious expressions, began to exit the mansion one by one.Yuder looked at the bodies strewn on the floor, the shattered windows, the broken ceiling, and the destroyed furniture, and thought that the mansion's owner would shed quite a few tears later. The elegance of the mansion when they first entered had long since vanished.\"Yuder.\"As he was about to turn around, Kishiar quietly called his name from behind. When he looked back, Kishiar was staring at the box containing the Red Stone again.\"Ah, I almost forgot to return the box to you, Commander.\"Yuder, interpreting the gaze as a silent command to return the box, reached out his arm.\"No, the box is fine. But your hand, what happened to it?\"...Hand?Only then did Yuder realize that it was not the box but his own hand holding it that had caught Kishiar's attention.'Ah. That spot where the energy from the Red Stone exploded through yesterday... Hmm?'On the back of Yuder's hand, a purple bruise had swelled to the size of a small bird's egg.It hadn't been that large when he had gone to retrieve the Red Stone earlier in the day. It was a tiny bruise, as if punctured with a nail. When exactly had it grown this much?There was no pain, and he hadn't felt any signs of the bruise growing, so Yuder looked at it in surprise.'It's definitely bigger, it's not just my imagination.'\"Judging by your expression, you only just noticed,\" Kishiar said, apparently guessing the situation from Yuder's expression and sighing softly.\"I wanted to see the extent of your abilities, but I didn't wish for you to get injured in the process.\"\"No, it's not that. I didn't know because it didn't hurt.\"\"So, what does that make me, who said I'd treat you well?\"With that, Kishiar extended a hand towards Yuder. His palm faced upwards, as if inviting him to dance. Yuder was momentarily captivated by the elegant movement, almost forgetting they were inside a half-destroyed mansion.\"Put your hand here, I'll treat it. You should put the box down, just in case it reacts.\"\"\u2026Are you going to use your divine power?\"\"What else could it be?\"Kishiar's response was gentle when Yuder asked out of curiosity. He wanted to say it was okay, but his curiosity to verify if Kishiar could truly use his divine power was stronger.As Yuder hesitated and put the box down, Kishiar immediately grabbed the bruised hand.Yuder unknowingly tensed his shoulders.\"Relax. This is a pure contact with no impure intentions.\"Kishiar whispered lowly, a twinkle in his eyes, as if he had sensed Yuder's movement.\"\u2026I wasn't thinking that way.\"\"Hahaha.\"Kishiar burst into laughter at Yuder's stiff response.Living and working alone for a long time, Yuder's hand was knotted and scarred. Unlike his, Kishiar's hand was pale and smooth.But that beautiful hand was surprisingly cold and hard, like a swordsman's hand hardened by the hilt of a sword.The touch of that hand, which he had long forgotten, tried to force back memories into Yuder's mind.Yuder bit his lip and tried to suppress unnecessary thoughts. From Kishiar's hand, a white light flowed out, gently covering the back of Yuder's hand. It was an unmistakably divine power, even more certain when felt directly.'At this level, it would be among the top ranks of the priests of the Sun God\u2026\u2026.'\"Is it that surprising for me to use divine power?\"Kishiar asked softly. Yuder was startled for a moment, thinking his thoughts had been read, but then he nodded.\"...Yes.\"\"Well, it's understandable, given that very few people know about this.\"\"Can... Can His Majesty the Emperor also use such divine power, besides you?\"\"Of course, he can.\"The answer came easily, as if it was the most natural thing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There's no need to hide it, is there?\"\"I suppose so. But it's a power that, when revealed, wouldn't bring much good. It's as if it might as well not exist. I think it's better to believe it doesn't from the start.\"At such a seemingly jesting response, Yuder blinked in puzzlement, to which Kishiar responded with a smile.\"Seeing you risk your life and use your strength to save others time and time again is what made me decide to use this power. If it were revealed that I've used it, my adjutant Nathan would be furious. He might even forbid me from going out at night. So, keep it a secret, will you? Let it be our little pact.\"Yuder stared at Kishiar's smile, unable to discern what was truth and what was deception.Could someone truly exist who, for such a simple reason, wouldn't use their healing power until the moment of their death? But he couldn't ask the Kishiar of the past for an answer.\"...I understand. But, may I ask one more thing?\"\"Sure, as long as it's not whether I possess the power of the awakened, the divine power, and the power accumulated as a knight.\"Yuder was momentarily lost for words. Kishiar smiled, looking like a boy who had successfully played a fun prank.\"You're the only one in this place who knows that I was chosen by the divine sword. I guessed you'd have questions as soon as you saw me use divine power.\"Kishiar's red eyes, like a sun illuminating all, seemed to read everything in a person's mind. His nonchalance, despite seemingly having figured out Yuder's thoughts yet not hinting at it until now, was masterful.\"...Is that possible?\"Yuder asked softly, deliberately omitting the subject 'the three powers'. Though his comrades had left and there was no one within earshot, one could never be too sure.\"Well, what do you think?\"\"If it's true, then what in the world could harm you?\"That is, assuming he deliberately chose not to dodge an incoming attack.\"...Even if anyone charges at you, they wouldn't stand a chance.\"Kishiar, adept at reading people's intentions, couldn't discern the fleeting memories of the past that had momentarily flickered in Yuder's dark eyes.\"Haha, you're more skilled at flattery than I thought. I never would've guessed, considering you never seemed the type to say things just to please.\"\"I merely stated the truth.\"\"Yes, your words might indeed be true. But, what does it matter?\"A strange look briefly flitted over his red eyes.\"No matter what I possess, it's meaningless to me. What I truly need isn't anything like that.\"His words suggested that all of it was insignificant. Yuder was once again at a loss for words.Such things?To belittle the incredible notion of a single human possessing the power of an Awakener, divine power, and aura...The Kishiar he had met upon returning to the past was even more mysterious and unfathomable than the one he remembered. Even Yuder, who had experienced all sorts of things and grown over the past decade, couldn't clearly comprehend him.\"Then, what do you believe you need, sir?\"\"Do you want to know that?\"The once youthful, carefree, and world-weary energy in Kishiar's gaze vanished in an instant. He once again adopted the leisurely and languid countenance of a duke, his eyes gently curving.\"Accept the position of Cavalry assistant, then.\"\"Assistant... please wait a moment. There's no such position, is there?\"Indeed, no such position existed in the past. Kishiar had delegated all assistant duties to his adjutant, Nathan Zuckerman. Anything relating to the Cavalry was entrusted to the deputy commanders, including Yuder. It had always been sufficient. But now, a position as Cavalry Assistant?\"Just make one. It seems like you're reluctant to take on the role of Deputy Commander, so I thought about creating a comfortable position that no one would be responsible for.\"Kishiar responded in a smooth tone, as if he had thought of this all along.\"The Cavalry has been established not too long ago, so it should be possible to create such a position. I'm very fortunate.\"\"...\"\"So, you don't like this idea either?\"Kishiar's hand, radiating a white light, tightened its grip on Yuder's hand. With his treatment not yet complete, Yuder had no choice but to neither resist nor flee.Yuder shot a somewhat disrespectful look at the man before him, who seemed to thoroughly enjoy seeing him in a predicament.\"Why do you value me so highly?\"\"Isn't it obvious? Your determination to repay those who threaten your life with their own lives, your excellent judgement to protect others at the cost of your own safety. Your combat skills are as proficient as a knight who's been through countless battlefields. If I don't value you highly, then who should I value?\"\"I'm not the only one like that. Everyone else was the same.\"\"The other members did very well too. But the calmness you showed is something that can't be acquired through just a few months of training. I highly regard that.\"The light flowing from Kishiar's hand stopped. However, he still held Yuder's hand. In his grip, a certain determination could be sensed. Looking down at the hand held by Kishiar, Yuder opened his mouth.\"If I refuse again...\"\"Then I will create the position of Cavalry Training Officer.\"Even if he refused that offer, another similar one would follow.Yuder realized that Kishiar had already made up his mind. When he had suggested it before, it felt somewhat tentative, but this time was different. As Yuder had rejoined the Cavalry, there were limits to refusing the Commander's will. Even more so if it was sincere.\"I understand.\"In the end, Yuder nodded.\"You've made a wise decision. We'll discuss the details when we return.\"Kishiar released his grip with a smile.\"...Hm?\"However, a moment later, he opened his eyes wide in rare surprise, his face a picture of confusion. Yuder also felt a sense of bewilderment.\"This is...\"The bruise on the back of his hand, which should have completely healed by now, hadn't vanished entirely. It had only shrunk to its original small size, a small, dark red spot remaining on the skin. The two fell silent, looking at the spot.\"...It wasn't an ordinary injury.\"Kishiar's eyes narrowed.\"Tell me exactly how you got hurt, Yuder Aile.\"There was no need to hide the reason for his injury. Yuder looked at his hand and opened his mouth.\"When the Gakane\u2019s shadow clone touched the Red Stone and exploded yesterday, I was a bit late in putting up the barrier. I think it's a trace of the energy from the stone that pierced through my hand.\"\"Energy from the stone?\"Kishiar furrowed his eyebrows as he looked at the box placed at Yuder's feet. His eyes seemed to race with countless thoughts in an instant.\"So... there's no pain?\"\"Yes.\"There was no pain even when the bruise grew. It was the same now. Yuder clenched and unclenched his fist lightly, feeling a strange sensation.\"That's fortunate at least. But if anything feels off, report it immediately. We will need to investigate the injury once we return.\"\"Understood. I will also check if the other comrades have similar injuries.\"\"Commander, Yuder! What happened inside? General Gino is worried.\"Just then, Gakane's voice rang out. Kishiar and Yuder briefly met each other's gaze before rushing out of the mansion.Outside the mansion were the Cavalry members, General Gino, the Peletta Knights who had rushed here without sleep, and the soldiers. General Gino and the Peletta Knights were able to stand at a similar distance as the Cavalry members, but others could not. Faces staring from afar were full of confusion.Despite having protected the place for two years, the Imperial Army was of no help when those coveting the Red Stone infiltrated.It was fortunate that Kishiar was unharmed; otherwise, it would have been a great calamity. Naturally, General Gino, who led them, didn't look well either.\"I'm glad to see Your Highness unharmed. However, the fact that those beasts could reach this place is my responsibility. It's deeply shameful. Now that they're all dead, what should we do?\"\"I haven't been hurt at all, so don't worry, General. However, since the dead had been hiding around here for days, release your soldiers to search the vicinity immediately, and inform me as soon as you find anything.\"\"Understood.\"General Gino turned around and immediately began giving orders to his soldiers loudly.After most of the soldiers quickly disappeared, Kishiar called the general closer and said he would be leaving soon.Having seen the audacious moves of the enemy, General Gino didn't stop Kishiar. He immediately called one of the soldiers who remained at his side.\"Go and fetch the Misty Wind Horses right away.\"Despite it being late at night, preparations for departure were made in an instant. Kishiar, having draped a long cloak to cover his uniform, received the box containing the Red Stone from Yuder.His figure, lightly leaping onto the Misty Wind Horse and grabbing the reins, resembled a manifestation of the Sun God who had emerged to illuminate the darkness.\"I will lead the way. The Cavalry members will follow right behind, and the Knights will follow as closely as possible. We will run without rest, so be careful not to lose your way.\"\"Understood!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Peletta Knight, who had served as a guide on their journey, had given Kishiar the special magic stone that indicated he could handle all the horses.When their lord, whom they should protect, decided to lead in the most dangerous situation, the Knights should have naturally tried to dissuade him, but they remained relatively calm. Yuder read an absolute trust and belief in Kishiar from them.\"We're setting off!\"Leaving General Gino behind, they departed from the Southern Army base. The mood was extremely heavy and solemn due to their sudden departure under unfavorable circumstances.Eleven Misty Wind Horses ran unimpeded across the fields blanketed by the darkness of night. These horses faced no difficulty seeing in the dark, easily avoiding any obstacles in their path.The bodies of the horses, glowing as if sprinkled with powdered pearls, were the only sources of light in the place. Yuder gripped the reins more tightly, enduring the chilling and hair-raising sensation.No matter how convenient and fast a mode of transportation, an entity not born from nature was diametrically opposed to it.Kishiar rode his horse in a completely different manner than when they had arrived. Thanks to the incredibly fast pace, harsh even, by the time day broke, they had already traveled far beyond the mountain range.\"Yuder. We need to talk.\"Gakane, who had dismounted the horse to rest, approached Yuder and spoke in a lowered voice.\"What exactly happened yesterday? You took down those guys with the Commander, so you must know something more?\"\"I'm not really sure.\"In truth, Yuder had taken them down alone, but he didn't bother correcting Gakane. There was no benefit in flaunting his abilities.\"I was about to leave the box when they showed up. I just took them down to defend myself.\"\"How could so many of them have been here in advance? They figured out that we had recovered the Red Stone so quickly....\"\"Kanna Wand. Come over here.\"Just then, Kishiar called Kanna. Everyone's gaze instantly focused on Kanna. Surprised, Kanna, who was opening a water bottle, turned her head.\"Yes?\"\"Can you read these items while we rest?\"Kishiar took out several items from his pocket. A torn glove, a broken dagger handle, and a shattered piece of dice. Yuder recognized them as belonging to the dead intruders.It seemed he had taken them when he briefly entered the mansion before their departure.\"Of course. I'll give it a try.\"Kanna's expression turned serious. She had been unable to shake off her worry, believing that she had been of no help in this mission. She took a deep breath at the opportunity that had come once again.First, Kanna held the glove. As she closed her eyes and focused, a faint energy rippled within her palm.\"...I can only read personal information about the owner. This is the toughest material the owner possessed, so he often wore this glove during battles. And... he also used it when shaking hands with someone. It seems like a very strong memory. He placed a large bag of money on top of the glove. After counting the money, he removed the glove and marked the count with his finger....\"After saying this, Kanna opened her eyes. She had made a lot of progress over the months, training and using her ability countless times.Before she joined the Cavalry, there were many things she couldn't read, and most of the information she could decipher amounted to fragments of words. But now, she knew she could always decipher something. The information she could read had become much more detailed. Mostly, it consisted of the most potent memories related to the object.\"The one who gave the money is likely connected to the one I'm seeking.\"Kishiar nodded and handed her the next object. It was a broken dagger handle. Kanna gripped it and focused once again.\"Fear. I can read the immense fear and regret the last person who held this felt. And resentment towards someone. The person who commissioned them... a stranger they'd never met... a noble from the Empire.\"\"A noble from the Empire?\"Gakane, who had been silently listening, asked in surprise. Kanna opened her eyes. Her blue irises were filled with a serious look.\"It's a word the person holding the dagger thought strongly of. They seem to have speculated among themselves that the identity of the person behind the commission might be a noble from the Empire.\"The atmosphere turned cold in an instant at Kanna's words. The one to break it was Kishiar, who still bore a look of interest.\"Well... considering what they've done, it's not an impossibility.\"\"But why would a noble from our nation dare to act against our commander, a member of the imperial family? Isn't the commander's retrieval of the Red Stone for the peace of this nation? Why on earth would...\"As Gakane mumbled in confusion, Kishiar responded with a slightly deeper smile instead of an answer.\"Nobles have their own ways, Gakane Bolunwald. If everyone had the same loyalty as you, we would be quite comfortable by now.\"It was a loaded statement. Gakane seemed taken aback, as if he'd said something inappropriate, but Yuder recalled memories from a past life.In his previous life, Yuder had gained some insight into the power structure of the Empire by attending many parties and gatherings at the Emperor's command.The people believed that the Emperor held the greatest power in the world and that those serving him were filled with genuine loyalty. But that wasn't the reality. The four Duke families, long-standing throughout the Empire's history, were as arrogant as if the nation had four additional kings.Remembering the audacious faces of those even the imperial family had to tread lightly around, Yuder could understand what Kishiar meant. Indeed, nobles had their own ways.\"Now, the last object.\"Kanna held the last object, a broken dice, in her hand. From her concentrated face with closed eyes, a deep focus unlike anything seen before emanated.\"The owner of this object... was addicted to gambling. They needed a lot of money. They had awakened their power, but seemed dissatisfied with their unchanged life. Besides, fear and regret... similar to the previous objects I read.\"Kanna opened her eyes and looked at the commander's face. He was nodding with a satisfied look.\"Good. Thanks to you, we've obtained some interesting information. But can you read the stone inside the box?\"Kanna, who had just been smiling brightly at having her ability acknowledged, became serious again.\"I can only read the history of the box. I'm sorry.\"\"What a pity for such a good ability.\"Kishiar expressed his regret sincerely. Yuder agreed as well.How wonderful it would be if Kanna's ability had advanced enough to read stones without direct contact. Judging by the current rate of progress, it wouldn't take long.However, if things went as they had in the past, Kishiar would head to the palace with the Red Stone as soon as he arrived in the capital. By then, even if Kanna's ability had developed, the stone would have already become the World Sphere.'If only I could prevent or delay that.'Previously, he had thought that the ignorant mages of the Pearl Tower had recklessly chipped away at the power of the Red Stone and damaged the original. But having participated in this mission and realizing the extraordinary power within the Red Stone, his thoughts had changed.Several ways to protect the Red Stone whirled confusingly in Yuder's mind and then disappeared.The easiest way, of course, was to make Kishiar himself realize the value of the stone. Then, he could persuade the emperor not to send the stone to the Pearl Tower.Yuder's gaze stealthily turned toward Kishiar.------At the same time, in the imperial palace in the northern part of the Orr Empire's capital.A man with grizzled hair and a young boy were sitting across from each other, setting up several intricately shaped pieces for a strategic game. At a glance, it seemed like an old man playing with his young grandson, but a closer look revealed that their relationship was not so close.The old man's eyes were well-collected, cruel, and cunning, and the boy sitting in front of him had a fierce beauty that did not match his young age.\"The Duke of Peletta seems to have succeeded in his retrieval. He said he would be back soon,\" the old man muttered as he moved a piece on the board. His voice was nonchalant.\"Is that so?\"\"Were you already aware?\"\"I had to know naturally when the excitement in the Sun Palace reached the Bright Palace.\"The Bright Palace was a palace built for the crown prince. And the boy, with the golden hair and red eyes characteristic of the Orr Empire's imperial family, was none other than Prince Katchian La Orr, who was to be the next emperor.\"Did you also hear about the incident of those who coveted it appearing in the middle?\"The old man added another piece to his offensive. Despite the aggressive move, the Crown Prince was not flustered. He skillfully moved his piece to dodge and opened his mouth.\"Yes, I heard about that too. They say the subordinates of the Duke of Peletta resolved it adeptly. They say the monsters came from somewhere.\"\"Unfortunately, it seems that has not been revealed.\"\"Indeed. Quite a pity. They could have been on good terms with us.\"The words carried a ruthless intent, but the Crown Prince's expression was utterly calm.\"The Duke of Peletta is not the fool others make him out to be. He cunningly managed to establish that organization. He must never be underestimated.\"\"I thought he was a man too busy looking after himself to hide such a claw. It turns out those who scored this time were not Peletta Knights but members of a strange group the Duke established.\"At that, the Crown Prince stopped moving his piece for the first time and lifted his head.\"Was its name the Cavalry?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Was its name the Cavalry?\"\"I believe so. Kiolle has been making quite a fuss about them.\"The old man shook his head slowly, his brow furrowing.\"My ears are still ringing.\"\"Ah, due to the incident where he was humiliated by a commoner not long ago.\"\"I can't believe such a foolish one came from our house. We put him in the knight's order to gain some prestige, but instead of behaving, he came back humiliated by a mere commoner. It's a worry. He still doesn't understand what he did wrong.\"\"Don't be too upset, Duke Diarca. Not all children can be exceptional.\"Upon hearing the young crown prince's cool comfort, the old man, Duke Diarca, smiled.\"That's true. It seems that all the outstanding abilities that run in our blood have been granted to you, Your Highness.\"\"You flatter me too much.\"They returned their focus to the game. At first, the crown prince's pieces seemed to be simply avoiding those of the old man. But as time passed, surprisingly, the fleeing pieces began to knock down the old man's, starting to gain the upper hand. What seemed like retreat was, in fact, a meticulous strategy.In the end, the game concluded with the crown prince's victory. The crown prince spoke as he toppled the last piece the duke had placed.\"His Majesty will bestow rewards upon Duke Peletta and his subordinates this time.\"\"To make a name for themselves throughout the continent, that would be best.\"\"I'm very curious about what grand game they plan to play, investing so much effort. My expectations are high.\"\"Is that all you're curious about? Aren't you finally going to see the famous stone? That's what I'm most curious about.\"At the duke's words, the crown prince simply grinned.\"Yes, everyone will see it soon.\"------Duke Kishiar La Orr of Peletta returned to the capital, having successfully completed the secret mission assigned by the emperor. As his departure and return were both quiet, almost no one knew he had left his post.Only Kishiar and those who journeyed with him felt a mix of emotions as they entered the capital. The worrying times, fearing someone might target the Red Stone before they returned to the capital, were over.\"You all did well.\"Upon reaching the front of the Cavalry barracks, Kishiar dismounted and briefly praised everyone.\"It was a difficult journey, but thanks to you all, who willingly followed me, we were able to return safely. Neither I nor His Majesty will ever forget your hard work. As it's late, go rest now. After breakfast tomorrow, come up to where I'm staying.\"The Peletta knights, who had kept a respectful distance due to the box containing the Red Stone, saluted with emotional faces. The Cavalry members' faces showed a mix of fatigue and pride.Kishiar turned his head to look at the entrance of the quarters. His adjutant, Nathan Zuckerman, was already there. His gaze lingered on the small box in Kishiar's hand, clearly guessing what it contained.\"Nathan. We need to return the Misty Wind Horse, call someone.\"\"Understood.\"\"And after that......\"Yuder left behind the brief conversation that Kishiar was having with his lieutenant and headed into the quarters with his fellow Cavalry members.The inside of the quarters, now shrouded in darkness, was not too dark, thankfully, thanks to the regular placement of glowstones. During the day, these stones looked ordinary, but at night, they shone as if a lamp had been lit. They were so expensive that even a well-off household could only afford a few.That such stones were generously embedded throughout the quarters was testament to how highly Kishiar regarded his Cavalry.\"I'm really tired from riding non-stop. I want to go wash up and sleep right away.\"\"Me too. I hope they've cleaned while we were away.\"The Eldore siblings yawned and chatted quietly. Nearby, Kanna was discussing with Gakane how it still felt like a dream that their mission had ended successfully. Everyone was in a peaceful mood with their tension relieved, but only Yuder was engulfed in deep silence.However, the other members did not find his introspective demeanor odd, as he had often been lost in thought before. They well knew the remarkable things he had accomplished during this mission.\"Yuder, see you tomorrow.\"\"Rest well, and don't think too much.\"Yuder nodded at his colleagues' greetings and entered his room. The room, designated for one person, was small, but it had everything he needed.However, his gaze did not linger on the cleanly swept room, even though it had been cleaned in his absence. No sooner had Yuder placed his bag down and sat on the bed, than he rolled up his sleeve to inspect his hand.'Still the same.'The purple spot, which had not completely disappeared even after receiving Kishiar's divine power healing, had neither grown nor shrunk during his journey here. But Yuder could not be reassured. Despite his continuous pondering on the way, he could not figure out why the spot hadn't completely disappeared.While returning, he had pulled his sleeve or crossed his arms to hide it from anyone's view. If someone noticed the bruise-like spot that inexplicably grew or shrank, it would attract unnecessary attention.It was an injury sustained during a crucial secret mission they had sworn not to mention. To avoid any unnecessary trouble, he thought it would be best to get a separate glove.'And I need to find out if there are similar curses or diseases like this spot, and if they can be cured.'There had been many things he had planned to look into once he returned to the capital, but the spot had suddenly changed the priorities. He didn't like it, but he had no choice. If his body wasn't well, he wouldn't be able to do anything.Yuder finally stopped his worries after thinking up to this point. The accumulated fatigue from his long journey without proper rest surged in like a burst dam.He barely managed to undress and prepare for bed before collapsing onto it. Sleep washed over him as if it had been waiting.'...I have no regrets. Just a little... disappointed.'His voice held no strength, yet it sounded exceedingly elegant. Yuder blinked blankly. Through his blurred vision, he saw a figure.A man sitting upright at a beautifully carved desk, wearing a faint smile. Under his faded golden hair, his darkened red eyes shimmered.Yuder, upon seeing that smile, recognized who the man was, and when this scene took place.The man was Kishiar La Orr, as he appeared on the day of his death at the Duke's mansion in Peletta.The desk in front of him was carved from a unique wood that only grew in his territory of Peletta, as was the chair.The rugged yet stylish stone fireplace was completely empty and incredibly dark, as though it hadn't been used in a long time. The only thing in that space that hadn't lost its light was the divine sword, which lay atop a transparent scabbard on the fireplace.Everything was as vivid as reality, but it was undoubtedly a dream. An old memory was unfolding once again, of its own accord. Even though he was aware of this, Yuder couldn't escape from the dream.Was this a kind of punishment, to have to watch this nightmare until the end once it had begun? He wasn't pleased, but there was nothing he could do about it. Yuder decided to hope that it would end quickly. According to his memory, he was about to swing his hand, and everything would end.But then,\"What are you saying?\"Yuder was taken aback by the sound of his own voice in the next moment.What on earth was happening? He had no memory of giving such a response. Unaware of Yuder's confusion, Kishiar opened his mouth again.\"...I wonder where it all went wrong. Thinking about it, it seems like it was when we retrieved the Red Stone.\"\"...\"\"Yes... That's right. It must have been then that everything started going wrong. But even knowing that, I couldn't stop it. Because I had no other choice.\"In Yuder's memory, Kishiar hadn't said anything like that as he faced death. Amidst the immense confusion, Kishiar's words seemed to continue, teetering on the brink of stopping.\"If the injury I sustained from touching that stone hadn't shattered my vessel......\"\"...\"Yuder awoke with a start, drenched in cold sweat.The familiar ceiling of his quarters greeted him. He had finally woken from his dream. However, he wasn't able to calm down easily and spent quite some time panting heavily. It was no wonder why.In the dream, Kishiar and Yuder had a conversation that was not in the original memory.And it was precisely about the retrieval of the Red Stone.It felt too real to be simply a dream mixed with delusions. It felt so real that it seemed as if his original memory was the one that was wrong.Holding his throbbing head, Yuder recalled the words that Kishiar had said in the dream. He was saying that everything went wrong from the injury he got when retrieving the Red Stone.That was something that hadn't happened in reality. Currently, the one injured by the red stone was Yuder. He let out a long sigh while looking at the unchanging spot on the back of his hand.'I should consider the possibility that what I thought I remembered from that day might not be the complete memory.'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gradually, light was seeping in through the window. He was not likely to sleep anymore, so it seemed better to get washed early.However, the moment he saw the small table set up in the room, the image of Kishiar from his dream unexpectedly resurfaced in his mind. Red eyes staring at him as he sat quietly at the desk.Although he had claimed to be free of regret, the look in his eyes would have been impossible to believe for anyone who saw him.What exactly was the emotion wavering in those eyes?Had that really happened?If something in his memory had been wrong up until now, where was the line between truth and lies?Who dared to meddle with the memories of Yuder Aile? Yuder sighed as he wrestled with the unanswered question.'Even if that memory was true... everything is different now.'This time, Kishiar had not received any injuries during the operation to retrieve the Red Stone. Moreover, he had not used the divine sword when the invaders attacked. The fact that he was the master of the divine sword was still a secret known only to a few.That was enough. So far, Yuder's objectives were proceeding smoothly. With a firm clench of his fist, he decided to be satisfied with that fact for now.His hand bore a small, purplish bruise.Yesterday, Kishiar had told Eldore siblings, Gakane, Kanna, and Yuder to come to where he was staying the morning after breakfast.However, Yuder couldn't go down to the large dining hall where the Cavalry members gathered to eat. Thirty minutes before breakfast time began, someone knocked on his door.It was Nathan Zuckerman, as always, his face calm.\"The Duke is asking for you.\"\"...Now?\"\"Yes.\"Yuder had assumed that Kishiar had summoned all the Cavalry members who had accompanied him on his mission because something urgent had come up.But when he arrived, all he saw was Kishiar sitting leisurely alone in front of a table set for a simple meal. There were no other squad members in sight.\"You're here. Sit down.\"Kishiar waved his hand in a light manner, holding a piece of bread cut into bite-size pieces, skewered with meat and vegetables. His demeanor was so casual that, if not for the setting, one might have mistaken it for a picnic.Without realizing, Yuder turned his head to Nathan standing behind him. Nathan silently nodded. This meant that Kishiar had indeed called for Yuder alone.With a slight sense of apprehension, Yuder made his way towards Kishiar, surveying his surroundings. He could feel the heavy and tingling aura of the Red Stone pervading the entire space, but he couldn't see the box containing the stone. It must have been placed somewhere deep inside.\"Why have you called for me alone?\"\"Let's eat first and then talk. You haven't had breakfast yet, have you?\"Yuder looked down at the dishes set before him. He was slightly taken aback, not being able to guess the purpose of the summons, but it was indeed something Kishiar would do.'Anyway, once Kishiar said let's eat and talk, he'd keep his word.'Yuder, sensing that further speech would yield no results, sat down before him.\"It's all simple food that you can eat. There's no need to mind your manners, so feel free to enjoy. Just so you know, I like the dish that's right in front of me.\"The dish Kishiar indicated with a casual nod was a food skewered on a wooden stick. It was made by grinding various grains into dough, shaping it into a round form, and grilling it. Inside, it was filled with a variety of ingredients, making it easy to eat and tasty.While waiting for Yuder, Kishiar had already eaten a few, as evidenced by the neatly stacked empty wooden skewers on his plate.Yuder, looking at it, slowly picked up a skewer. As he awkwardly opened his mouth and bit into the well-grilled white lump, a wave of heat spread in his mouth. The dish Yuder had chosen was filled with meat that had been stir-fried and seasoned with a savory sauce.Despite his lack of appetite due to the nightmare he had the night before, he thought he could manage to eat a decent amount, as the food was not overwhelmingly flavored.Quietly chewing his food, Yuder caught sight of the red eyes looking at him, smiling as if expecting something. He began to feel a strange sensation.\"Do you have something to say?\"\"How's the taste?\"\"...\"Yuder maintained a brief silence. It was difficult to ascertain whether the question was genuinely asking for his opinion about the taste, or whether it was a probe for something else.\"It's delicious...\"He responded in a mundane, safe manner. But it wasn't sincere. Yuder had never really experienced a craving for food in his previous life.To him, there was no significant difference between the soup he ate at the rundown inn when he first met Gakane and the beautifully skewered dish he was eating now. If there was a way to live without eating, he would have been the first to adopt it.\"No, not such an insincere answer.\"Kishiar shook his head.\"Being my assistant means you have to answer such questions sincerely. Now, answer again. How's the taste?\"Yuder's eyebrows twitched slightly.'Surely being an assistant doesn\u2019t just involve answering questions about food?'Was he just messing around? Anyway, if he wanted such a 'sincere' answer, he could give it. Yuder pieced together plausible words and spat them out in a lengthy response.\"Though simple in appearance, one can feel the care and time that went into making it. The flavor is mild and clean, making it suitable for a morning meal. I can't express what a great honor it is to share such a meal with you, commander.\"There, was that alright? He'd done as requested, and he thought that would be enough, but Kishiar surprisingly shook his head again, a suppressed laugh shaking his shoulders.\"Disappointing. That's not the answer I wanted. You still don't get it?\"What was he supposed to understand from a question about taste? Yuder had never encountered such strange inquiries when he was Kishiar's assistant.Of course, Kishiar had been a very peculiar person then, too, but at least he hadn't started off like this from day one of Yuder's deputyship. Feeling slightly frustrated, Yuder opened his mouth.\"I've been indifferent to the taste of food since birth. There's hardly any difference between gruel and gourmet cuisine on my tongue, so whatever I say, I fear it won't satisfy you...\"\"That's it.\"\"Pardon?\"\"That honesty, that's what I wanted.\"Yuder blankly stared at Kishiar, who was finally nodding with a satisfied expression.\"Do you really expect the one chewing food with the expression of eating sand to say it tastes good?\"\"...\"\"If it tastes bad, say it tastes bad; if you have no appetite, say so. That's what I expect from my assistant.\"His voice, soft yet carrying an undeniable weight, resonated.Only then did Yuder comprehend the true intent behind Kishiar's persistent questioning. He didn't want to hear a superficial, polite answer.Kishiar had used the seemingly light and unexpected medium of a meal to break down the walls Yuder had erected and draw out his true feelings.It was surprising that such a serious matter lay beneath a seemingly trivial question. His method of making one let down their guard for a moment was brilliant. It was baffling but at the same time genuinely admirable.'Even knowing that Kishiar uses such tactics, I let my guard down.'Yuder blinked, then let out a small sigh.\"...In that case, I'll stop eating now. I'm not hungry.\"\"Hahaha! Do as you please. But at least have this juice. Nathan personally squeezed it for us.\"Kishiar laughed heartily, pointing at two glasses placed on one side of the table. It was juice made by grinding a mixture of vegetables and fruits.Yuder looked at Nathan, who stood behind him with a stern expression, then lifted his glass and drained it in one gulp. The green juice seemed like it would taste very strange, but it was surprisingly sweet.\"You're giving me a profound lesson on my first day as an assistant. Is this why you called me first?\"\"Not at all. The real matter is this.\"Kishiar, who seemed to be preparing to finish his meal as well, elegantly wiped his mouth with a white cloth and extended his hand towards Nathan. Nathan approached the large desk, picked something up, and respectfully placed it on Kishiar's hand.It was a pair of black gloves.Yuder's expression changed in an instant.\"You seem surprised. The wound hasn't healed yet, so it needs to be covered. These are special gloves with magic that sticks to the wearer's skin and promotes healing. They won't be damaged even if they get wet or bloody, so wear them without worry. There's no need to thank me for a wound you got while protecting me.\"He had been thinking that he would need to get a glove anyway. It was fortunate that he didn't have to go out and buy one, but that wasn't why Yuder was surprised.In his previous life, Kishiar often wore such gloves. Among the gloves he wore, there was definitely one that looked exactly like the one in front of him. The memories from that time, vivid as if he had forgotten them, suddenly came flooding back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the past, Yuder hadn't paid much attention to Kishiar's attire. There were occasionally members with unique abilities who wore odd clothes, so the fact that Kishiar often wore gloves wasn't particularly unusual. However, on reflection, Yuder realized that since his return, Kishiar had never once worn gloves.As soon as he realized this, naturally, a dream from the night before flashed through his mind.Could the Kishiar of his previous life have truly suffered the same injury as Yuder during the Red Stone retrieval operation? Could that be why he always wore clothing that covered his body, even needing to wear gloves?'Come to think of it, whenever I had to meet Kishiar regularly, it was always in the darkness of the night.'If he had been injured by the Red Stone, there would be a purplish bruise somewhere on his body. Yet, even Yuder, who might have seen Kishiar's body more than anyone else except for his wet nurse, had never noticed it.Kishiar always appeared out of the darkness and disappeared before Yuder awoke. The fact that Yuder had never found this odd was because, before Kishiar's death, he had simply accepted it as a part of who Kishiar was, and after his death, he had tried to bury those memories in oblivion.If he had realized something was amiss earlier, if he had taken an interest in Kishiar's condition, could things have changed?\"I said I didn't need any thanks, but isn't that expression a bit much? You're looking at me as if I'm a ghost.\"Kishiar, having noticed Yuder's expression, asked him with narrowed eyes. Only then did Yuder manage to calm his shock and complex thoughts, shaking his head.\"No, it's not that... Thank you.\"\"When someone asks, say it's a reward I gave you for accepting the position of aide.\"If Kishiar said it was a reward he personally gave, even if Yuder wore it every day, people around him wouldn't find it strange. Besides, it was even enchanted to be helpful, so not wearing it would be the odd thing.As Yuder nodded, Nathan, who had been standing behind them, quietly spoke up.\"It seems we will have visitors soon.\"\"Must be the other members. Nathan, clear away the remaining food.\"Kishiar nonchalantly ordered Nathan, one of the continent's top Swordmasters, as if he were a servant. There was plenty to say about such treatment, but Nathan simply followed his orders as if it were the most natural thing.While Nathan quickly stacked the plates and disappeared into the inner room, Yuder put on the gloves he had received from Kishiar.They seemed to be made of leather on the outside, but once worn, they felt slick, like a slightly cold liquid adhering to his hand. Even when he clenched and unclenched his fist, there was none of the stiffness characteristic of leather.\"Just as I thought, they suit you well. My judgment was indeed correct.\"Kishiar proudly complimented himself with a satisfied expression. Yuder didn't respond. He felt no need to feign agreement with insincere politeness when honesty, however unpleasant, was preferred.\"By the way, did you confirm that none of the other members were injured?\"\"Ah, yes. There were none.\"Throughout his return journey, Yuder had taken the time to ask his companions individually about any injuries. While some had minor scratches or muscle aches from climbing the mountain, no one else had sustained injuries like his own. It was a relief.At the time of the explosion, Yuder had been closest to the Red Stone. It was just a few steps away, and he had thought he shielded everyone, but that small distance had created the current outcome.'Looking back, I should have put up the shield from the beginning.'Regret filled his mouth with bitterness.A while later, a knock on the door came along with the murmur of conversation from outside. Since Nathan hadn't yet returned, Yuder got up to open the door himself.\"Commander, I apologize. I was about to bring Yuder with me, but he wasn't in his room... Oh... Yuder!\"\"Yuder, you were here? What happened?\"As soon as the door opened, Gakane, who had been apologizing loudly with his head bowed, was startled to see Yuder and shouted out in surprise. The other comrades were equally surprised.Yuder gestured for them to come inside as he looked at their faces filled with betrayal and confusion.\"...Come in.\"Once everyone had settled into the long chairs, Kishiar greeted them as if he had been waiting.\"Did everyone have a restful night? I called Yuder here for a personal matter. I apologize for not informing you earlier.\"\"Ah... I see.\"Gakane finally collected his surprised expression and calmed down. The Eldore siblings wore expressions of curiosity about what might have transpired between the two.\"You all look curious. Would you like to know what you'll soon find out anyway?\"\"Yes.\"Between the firm responses, Kishiar gave a soft smile.\"Today, you all will accompany me to the Imperial Palace with the Red Stone. We will show the Emperor the stone, and receive our reward for completing the mission. It's a secret mission, so we can't celebrate in front of many, but please be satisfied with meeting the Emperor directly and receiving an award. And while we're there, I plan to appoint Yuder Aile as my Cavalry assistant.\"Such enormous news came out all at once, the members were momentarily speechless.\"The Imperial Palace?\"\"We're meeting the Emperor?\"\"Yuder will be the Commander's assistant?\"Each member exclaimed the most surprising fact to them, and they all looked at each other. The Imperial Palace of the Orr Empire was not a place anyone could visit. Even those born into nobility sometimes never set foot in it in their lifetime.Moreover, the current Emperor had not shown his face at official banquets for several years, citing health reasons. It was only natural that everyone's expressions froze in surprise at the news they'd be meeting such a person and receiving a reward directly from him.Yuder had been in and out of the Imperial Palace countless times in his previous life, so he wasn't surprised for that reason. But the fact that they were going to the Imperial Palace before he could convince Kishiar not to take the Red Stone to the Pearl Tower, and that he would directly meet the Emperor, whom he had never seen in his previous life, was quite shocking.The Emperor, Kishiar's only full sibling. In his previous life, he had died not long after this point in time, so Yuder expected his health to be extremely poor. But if he was well enough to give a commendation today, the known and actual conditions might be different.'Well, I have to tell Kishiar not to send the Red Stone to the Pearl Tower... but it's going to be hard to find an opportunity like this. What to do?'\"If we're leaving today... when are you planning to set off?\"\"Right now.\"Kishiar's answer to Yuder's speculative question was clear cut.\"So, we don't need to prepare anything?\"\"What's there to prepare? As long as you're in your proper uniform, that's sufficient.\"Kishiar, who appeared to find the question amusing, rose from his seat with a smile. The members followed suit, getting up with hesitant expressions.Yuder scanned the faces of his comrades, his gaze stopping at Kanna, whose face was unusually pale.'...What's going on?'Her face was as white as a sheet, too pale for someone simply nervous about a visit to the Imperial Palace. Even a casual glance told him something was very wrong.Yuder approached Kanna slowly, lowering his head after seeing Kishiar head towards the inner corridor to fetch the box containing the Red Stone.\"What's the matter?\"\"Ah!\"Kanna, looking as though she had been deliberately startled, stepped back a few paces, casting a glance at the others with sweat beading on her forehead.\"I'm sorry. I, I mean. That is...\"\"Kanna?\"\"Oh, well... I mean, if I go there... I mean...\"Kanna was trembling, stuttering, a far cry from her usual lively self. Her behavior was puzzling.\"What's wrong, Kanna? Are you not feeling well?\"Upon hearing Hin's worried question, Kanna stepped even further back. Her shaking head revealed a mixture of confusion and fear.\"I mean... do I have to go there?\"\"Where do you mean? The Imperial Palace?\"The mention of the Imperial Palace drained Kanna's face of all color. It was clear that she was reacting excessively to the word 'Imperial Palace'.\"Why all of a sudden?\"\"No, it's not... I mean... I apologize for talking nonsense.\"\"It doesn't seem like nothing...\"Finn, standing next to Hinn, tilted his head in confusion. But Kanna closed her mouth. Their conversation was cut short by the return of Kishiar and Nathan from the inner corridor, Kishiar wearing a splendid cape.\"Alright, let's depart now. We'll be riding in a carriage this time, so it'll be comfortable.\"Kishiar, holding the box containing the Red Stone, led the way with a calm demeanor, unaffected by the tingling sensation penetrating his skin from the energy of the stone. Nathan and the members hurried after him.The carriage they would be riding was already waiting at the rarely used back gate. The carriage, large enough to comfortably hold seven people, was emblazoned with the emblem of the Imperial Palace. Its opulence, including the lavish use of gold, was overwhelming.Even the eight horses pulling the carriage had been replaced with Misty Wind Horse, possibly for fear that ordinary horses couldn't withstand the energy of the Red Stone. This sight drew spontaneous gasps from the members.\"Incredible...\"\"Nathan, I'm counting on you to handle the coachman's role.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKishiar gave Nathan a light command and stepped briskly into the open carriage door. Looking at the large door which allowed the tall Kishiar to enter without bending his body even slightly, Gakane swallowed his saliva.\"Is it really true that the imperial carriage has been designed by grand mages to prevent even the slightest jolt?\"\"We'll know when we get in.\"Yuder swallowed his affirmation silently and replied just so.Kanna did not marvel at the royal carriage like the others. After getting on, rather than being surprised at the smooth ride, she was constantly fidgeting as if there were thorns beneath her buttocks.Her gaze intermittently turned to the window, swirling with unfathomable thoughts.Why would she, a commoner, be so anxious upon hearing that she was going to the palace?Yuder kept his gaze on Kanna, perplexed. Yet, Kanna seemed not to feel his intense gaze, her mind continuously elsewhere.'The Red Stone issue is a problem, but something's off with Kanna too. If she stays like this even after we arrive, I'll need to keep an eye on her.'------The Imperial Palace of the Orr Empire, La Luma Palace, was situated in the deepest part of the capital. Built in an era when the relics of ancient times had not yet disappeared, the palace had maintained its unique beauty for a thousand years and enjoyed a special reputation.Poets praised it as the most sacred paradise in the world, and everyone wished to see the Sun Palace spire, said to bear the touch of extinct races, at least once from afar.\"I can't believe I'm crossing all seven walls of Luma.\"Hearing Gakane's trembling voice, Yuder offered a faint smile. He had had the same thoughts on his first visit to the palace.Even a commoner living deep in the mountains knew the tales of the heroes who aided the founding emperor of the empire, and the legend of the wicked black mage Modal.Among these tales was the story of the Archmage Luma, who helped the emperor and chose the place to build the new palace, constructing seven walls to protect it.The Archmage surrounded the palace with seven walls, each infused with different magic and made of materials possessing seven different powers. To reach the Sun Palace at the center, one had to pass through all these walls.There was a significant distance between each wall, so those staying at the palace remained in specific sections within the walls, according to their purpose, status, or profession.What people generally thought of as the capital was actually the area within the outermost seventh wall, where commoners or middle-class individuals resided.It was a matter of course that the quarters of the Imperial Knights, where the cavalry barracks were located, had been there since ancient times. It was the duty of the Imperial Knights to guard against external invasions from the outermost edge of the palace.Unlike the seven walls, which were raised high like typical city walls, the walls from the sixth inward greeted visitors with some rather unconventional sights. Yuder casually observed the swiftly changing scenes beyond the carriage window.Tall white trees growing in regular intervals, twelve fountains each bearing the sculpted figure of a sage, statues of seven knights holding a large window and riding horses, and the sweet and special scent of flowers that, while invisible, seeped into every corner, uplifting the mood....All of it was the walls that divided the districts, they were living legends.The carriage occasionally halted in front of the soldiers guarding the district boundaries, only to speed off again. The carriage, bearing the imperial seal, was in itself an absolute pass.\"We've passed through three walls. We should be at our destination soon.\"Kishiar, who had been sitting quietly with his arms folded, murmured as he casually glanced outside the window.\"The more I visit this place, the more I pity the Archmage Luma. Despite the trouble of creating seven walls, humans still conduct their own inspections before them. What a pointless effort. Don't you think so?\"It seemed like a joke, but on the other hand, it was a statement that was difficult to laugh at. It was a daring remark, especially for Kishiar, who was born and raised in the imperial palace.However, Kishiar's eyes were languid, as if they held no intention. No one could decipher the sincerity hidden in his smile.\"We have arrived.\"A while later, the carriage came to a smooth stop. A small window connected to the driver's seat opened, and Nathan's voice was heard in brief.The Cavalry members looked at the slowly opening door with tense faces. Kishiar, who was holding a box with the Red Stone in one hand, opened his mouth leisurely as if to reassure them.\"Don't be tense. Hardly anyone knows we are coming today. Our meeting with His Majesty will only be brief. After that, I will be the only one left to have a private audience with His Majesty. Follow Adjutant Nathan and wait. Everything will be over then.\"\"Yes.\"It is customary that the highest-ranking person gets off last when alighting from a carriage. The Cavalry members got off the carriage one by one, leaving Kishiar, who had been sitting inside. When it was Yuder's turn, he paused instead of immediately getting off.He had cleverly wasted time to let the other members get off first, leaving only himself and Kishiar inside the carriage.The reason was simple. After considering it during the journey, the only moment he could express his opinion to Kishiar was now.\"Commander, is that box to be delivered to the palace today?\"As Yuder spoke quickly and quietly, Kishiar's eyes narrowed as if interested.\"Why do you ask?\"\"You tried to examine the stone with Kanna's ability during the recovery operation.\"\"That's right. But it was impossible.\"\"It's too much of a waste to give up just because it was impossible at one attempt. Maybe... could you think about giving it a little more time?\"Yuder cautiously but clearly expressed his opinion. Kishiar, who had been examining Yuder's face as if trying to understand his thoughts, tilted his head and gently raised the corner of his lips after a moment.\"Well... Do you think that with more time, it would become possible even though it was entirely impossible?\"Kishiar's reaction wasn't as bad as he thought. Judging by his words, it seemed that it hadn't been decided from the start to send the stone to the Pearl Tower. If it had, he probably would have reacted much more negatively.Then, there was only one thing left for him to show in the negotiation.Confidence.\"I will make it possible.\"\"Hmm, this is difficult. Such a proposal just before I have to present it to His Majesty. This is indeed, unexpected.\"Contrary to his words, Kishiar, who smiled while gently stroking the lower part of his lips, sank into his thoughts for a moment. Yuder was teetering on the edge of whether he should prepare a fallback plan in case Kishiar refused his proposal.After a few seconds that felt like an eternity, Kishiar lifted his eyes again. Their gazes met.\"Originally, I planned to deliver the box today. His Majesty was very curious about it, and I thought I had examined it enough.\"\"...\"\"But, considering this is the first request from an assistant who I had to coax into service... I can't help but accommodate. I can't give you a lot of time, but since I've given my word, you must succeed.\"The nefarious plan that had been swirling in Yuder's mind, contemplating even breaking into the imperial palace with a mask on to steal the box if necessary, evaporated instantly.Looking at Kishiar, whose interest was hidden behind a lazy smile, Yuder blinked and slowly bowed his head.\"Thank you.\"\"What for? It's just this much. I'm a man who keeps his word. Aren't you glad you accepted my offer?\"Without answering his question, Yuder quickly descended from the carriage, feeling a great weight lift off his shoulders. Following him, Kishiar elegantly stepped down onto the ground.The place they arrived at was the dazzlingly bright palace. Despite reflecting only the sunlight and devoid of any grand adornments, it was a place that made those standing before it seem tiny. Even the imperial carriage, grand as it was, lost its glow before the mystical majesty of the palace.The palace, with its unique beauty as if the greatest painter had drawn it on white paper using only bold lines, was the Sun Palace where the emperor resided.Yuder quietly gazed up at the palace he had visited countless times in his previous life. Whenever the emperor called, Yuder had to come here, regardless of where he was or what he was doing.He knew a considerable number of the countless secret passages hidden in this mysterious palace and remembered what was where like the back of his hand.He had never wanted to return here at the moment of his beheading, but fate had quickly brought him back to this place. It was strange.\"Your Highness. I have been waiting for you.\"An elderly man who had walked out from the inner court bowed deeply in greeting. Though his hair was as white as snow, his back was still straight, and his eyes sharp.'He's more capable than he appears.'Yuder inwardly admired the old man's ability to greet Kishiar, who was holding the box with the Red Stone, without showing a pained expression despite their surprisingly close proximity.Like most palace servants, he wore a belt tied with a special knot around his waist.The color of the belt and the number of knots gave a rough idea of one's rank. The old man's belt was a deep sea blue with five knots. Yuder's eyes narrowed slightly at the sight of the golden tassel hanging from the end of the belt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe blue belt signified the individual who served the Emperor directly, and the five knots represented over fifty years of service in the palace. The golden tassel symbolized the most brilliantly shining sun, a privilege only the head of the Emperor's attendants held.Yuder had no memory of seeing him in his previous life. The man seemed to have vanished with the death of the current Emperor.\"His Majesty is waiting for you in the Second Palace. Please follow me.\"\"I'm here today not as the Duke of Peletta but as the Commander of the Cavalry. I'd appreciate it if you could address me accordingly.\"\"Ah, indeed. This old man's memory fell short.\"The head attendant seemed quite familiar with Kishiar. Yuder didn't miss the swift but careful glance he cast over the Cavalry members.\"...\"The Cavalry members hardly dared to breathe as they passed through the long corridor and the garden. Among them, Kanna was by far the most nervous.Yuder saw that her habit of bowing her head and walking excessively low was a continuation of the peculiar behavior she had displayed before they arrived here.She seemed to want to hide her appearance from the gaze of others. He was curious about the reason, but in this quiet situation, he regretted that he couldn't strike up a conversation.The head attendant confidently traversed the third corridor and walked through the garden. Since he mentioned the Second Palace, they would have to cross a few more corridors. Yet, despite walking for so long within the palace, there was hardly any sign of people in the Sun Palace.In his memories of a previous life, the Sun Palace was always bustling with numerous attendants, visiting nobles for the imperial audience, and foreign diplomats. This tranquility felt odd to Yuder, but the head attendant and Kishiar seemed used to it.'Is the Sun Palace devoid of people due to the current Emperor's decree?'Just as he thought this, the head attendant suddenly halted.\"Someone is coming.\"Moments later, as he had said, they felt the presence of several people coming from beyond the pond on the right side of the garden. As soon as they spotted the head attendant, Kishiar, and the Cavalry members, they stopped in unison.From the belts around their waists, they were attendants. However, the belts they wore were as deep a red as twilight. Yuder knew what that red color signified.Red was the color of the Crown Prince, the future of the Empire.And the current Crown Prince was none other than the Emperor, Katchian La Orr, whom Yuder would serve until his death in the future.\"I was taking a walk and thought I saw a familiar figure. It turns out Duke Peletta is visiting.\"The tall group of attendants parted on both sides, revealing a boy from within. His appearance bore an undeniable resemblance to the imperial bloodline, much like Kishiar La Orr.The beautiful golden hair blessed by the Sun God, red pupils, and outstanding looks, though still youthful, were unmistakably traits of the imperial family.Although he appeared much smaller and younger than when Yuder first saw him in his previous life, how could he ever forget that face?Without realizing it, Yuder clenched his fist tightly. The sharp pain digging into his palm helped distinguish between the past and the present.The boy before him was still the Crown Prince. Katchian La Orr didn't even know who Yuder Aile was. At this moment, his gaze was solely on the head attendant and Kishiar.Observing it, Yuder reiterated to himself several times.Now was not the past. Many things had changed since then and would continue to change.Preventing the Crown Prince, in a few years' time, from calmly issuing an assassination order against Kishiar La Orr. That was the future he wanted to stop.If he said he held no resentment against the Emperor before his execution, it would have been a lie. However, even such emotions eventually vanished. Yudrain Aile, the Commander of the Cavalry, didn't have his regrets rooted in that.He once again recalled the thoughts he had reflected upon with bitter self-deprecation moments before death, utterly exhausted. In them, there was no longing for revenge.He hadn't returned to the Cavalry for revenge.Of course, there were no intentions of letting Katchian La Orr become Emperor as smoothly as before, given that he had to save Kishiar and also survive.In his previous life, the person he had watched over was far from being an excellent ruler. But now wasn't the time when he had accumulated enough power to intervene. The timing was too early.Yuder opened his eyes that he had closed and looked forward. Coincidentally, the first thing he saw was the straight back of Kishiar La Orr. He stood leisurely, like a large tree casting a shadow over the members behind him.Seeing just that, the emotions boiling within his chest began to slowly subside, and his usual composure returned. After a few deep breaths, he was able to observe the conversation between Prince Katchian and Kishiar with cool eyes.\"What a surprise. To meet Your Highness the Crown Prince here, it seems like it's going to be a lucky day for me.\"As Kishiar responded with a leisurely smile, a grin also spread across the prince's lips. If you judged by his face alone, he seemed genuinely pleased.\"Duke Peletta must be busy. I heard you have been even busier these days, but I'm glad to see you looking healthy today.\"\"You've been concerned about my health? I'm honored.\"\"But who are the strangers following you, Duke? I don't recognize these faces.\"The prince's gaze skimmed over the Cavalry members. During that brief moment when his gaze landed on Yuder's face, Yuder clenched his fist tightly then gradually released it.\"They are members of the Cavalry I created a while ago. They are talents who will become the power of our empire.\"\"Oh? I've heard the story. Hearing the Duke say that, I suddenly have high expectations. I hope one day to see their skills firsthand.\"\"Haha. You'll certainly be surprised.\"While pleasant conversation was exchanged, the Cavalry members glanced at each other. After a few more words about the Cavalry, the Crown Prince finally got to the point.\"Actually, I felt a strange energy from afar, which led me here, and only after meeting you, Duke, did I understand its source. What exactly is inside that box that gives off such an impression that I should not approach it any further?\"His tone was smooth, but his intent was clear. Yuder glanced at the small box that Kishiar was holding.Judging by his intuition, after observing Katchian La Orr for nearly ten years, the prince wasn't asking because he didn't know. He already knew what was inside. He simply wanted confirmation.'Coming to see for himself, even though he already knows, indicates he wanted to verify something. It might be nothing, but if not... it could be related to whoever was behind the targeting of Kishiar and the Red Stone.'All the way to this place, Yuder had been pondering the identity of the intruders' mastermind. There were countless possibilities.Kings of other nations greedily eyeing the Red Stone, the Sun God's church, which, although proclaiming this newfound power as a divine gift, might not be thrilled about the current situation, the Pearl Tower mages who couldn't resist their desire to study the stone, and many more were possible culprits.And among them was Katchian La Orr, who in Yuder's previous life had directly ordered the assassination of Kishiar La Orr. Knowing that the prince, who was about to become a power within the empire, had no reason to covet the stone in such a way, this possibility was low, but it was still a potential scenario that could not be completely dismissed.Unaware of Yuder's scrutiny, the prince merely smiled.\"I apologize, but it's difficult for me to speak about it, as it pertains to a task His Majesty has assigned. I can't disclose anything before reporting to him.\"Kishiar, too, was smiling. Unlike the prince, who appeared quite cold and fierce when not smiling, Kishiar maintained an inscrutable tranquility and leisureliness.\"Ah, if your visit is due to such pressing business, I can't keep you any longer. Let's have tea together some other time when we meet.\"With the Emperor invoked as an excuse, the prince immediately stepped back.\"I understand. Today's weather is lovely, so I hope you continue to enjoy this beautiful scenery.\"From behind Kishiar, the Cavalry members also bowed in unison. But their uneven salutes, each different from the other's, caused the prince's attendants to frown. It was clear from a glance that they looked down upon the Cavalry members as uncouth individuals.Yuder followed behind Kishiar for a while, then stealthily turned his head. He saw the retreating figure of the prince, disappearing into the distance along with his attendants.\"Would you mind waiting here for a while? I need to report to His Majesty.\"Even after parting with the prince, the squad walked quite a distance across the palace. The building they arrived at was the Second Palace, located in the innermost part of a complex linked by corridors and gardens.The Sun Palace was composed of seven buildings connected in a unique pattern. When inside, it felt peculiar, but it was said that from the sky, it resembled a constellation.The reason the number attached to each palace seemed unrelated to its actual position was due to this design. The Second Palace, being the furthest from the entrance among the seven buildings, was extremely inconvenient to visit.In his previous life, when Katchian La Orr was the Emperor, he barely used the Second Palace. Previous emperors only used it when they were old, tired, and wanted to cut off communication with the outside world.The head attendant informed them that the current Emperor, Keilusa La Orr, was waiting for them there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayInside the silent palace, the head attendant, who had stationed Kishiar and the Cavalry members outside the door, politely knocked before entering. This place was eerily quiet, void of even the typical sight of a guard knight.Could this really be the residence of an emperor of an empire? A silent question sprouted in everyone's gaze.'Considering Kishiar doesn't usually carry a servant around, having only Nathan Zuckerman by his side, it's possible there's something in common between the brothers.'Yuder also made a plausible conjecture amidst the silence.\"His Majesty has granted an audience. Please come in.\"Moments later, the door opened, and the head attendant reappeared. Kishiar strode into the room that the head attendant opened. The members all followed him, and only Nathan Zuckerman, who had been quietly following the group, naturally remained outside the door.Walking just behind Kishiar, Yuder quickly surveyed the surroundings. The place seemed designed for maximum efficiency, allowing all work to be done within a single space.Beneath a window pouring bright light, there was an office desk neatly arranged with pens of various types. Next to it, a stack of mixed scrolls and documents exuded a strong scent of dry paper.Behind what appeared to be an arch-shaped partition installed to divide the space, a curtained bed was seen, and next to it, a table with black tea giving off a unique aroma. It seemed a place where eating, sleeping, and working could all happen at once.And the owner of the palace, the emperor, sat in a high-backed chair placed not anywhere special, but under the wall, ready to greet them.\"You have arrived. I sense an unusual energy, it might be best not to come any closer.\"Upon hearing the Emperor's voice, Kishiar halted, and all the members simultaneously bowed their heads. The emperor coughed a few times before slowly continuing.\"Under normal circumstances, I would have received you at the seventh palace and honored you in the most glorious way, but I hope you understand that I had to see you here.\"\"Being able to complete the mission you entrusted to us is honor enough.\"Kishiar elegantly replied, taking a knee and bowing his head. The cavalry members, who were utterly surprised by the unexpected scenery, quickly followed suit, kneeling.\"Good. Raise your heads.\"After a moment, the Emperor quietly commanded them to raise their heads.Finally, Yuder got a good look at the Emperor's face. He seemed less like a ruler and more like a scholar who had been immersed in research for a long time. His features bore a striking resemblance to Kishiar's, but the atmosphere he exuded was entirely different.While Kishiar was tall and solid, exuding an air of composure with his lazy smile, the emperor appeared sensitive, his thin figure hidden behind glasses, his eyes tired, and not even a trace of a smile.He certainly wasn't as radiant as Kishiar. Nevertheless, he didn't seem to be so sick as to be incapable of handling state affairs, as was publicly known.But why? While observing him, Yuder felt a certain premonition from his tired appearance.'Seems like I've seen a similar sight somewhere...'Ah.At that moment, the Emperor slightly turned his head to briefly survey Yuder's face. In an instant, Yuder understood the nature of the sensation he'd felt. It was the same feeling he'd had from Kishiar in the dream the previous night, and now, the Emperor bore the same aura.His hair and eyes, once lustrous, now lacked their sheen. His face, as white as a bonfire on the verge of being extinguished, had lost all of its light, leaving only ashes behind.For a fleeting moment, the Emperor looked eerily similar to the dream's version of Kishiar, who had lost all his brilliance and was standing on the precipice of death. Why was that?The moment Yuder opened his mouth to voice this peculiar sensation, the Emperor slowly began to speak again.\"Merely by observing your aura, I can believe that beloved Duke Peletta has completed his task perfectly. I'm overjoyed to finally hold what I've long sought.\"Even as he spoke of joy, there was no trace of amusement in the Emperor's eyes. It was questionable whether his smile wasn't entirely stolen by Kishiar, his brother.After finishing his speech, the Emperor took a long breath and scrutinized the faces of the five Cavalry members.\"I've wanted to get my hands on it since it fell two years ago, but no one was successful. Court mages, the valiant knights of the imperial guard, even secretly hired mercenaries all failed. But only one person, Duke Peletta, was confident of success. That is, if he was provided assistance in assembling those awakened by the power of the Red Stone into a cavalry.\"\"Why bring up such old stories?\"Kishiar chuckled lowly, pretending to chide the Emperor. But the Emperor ignored him and continued his tale.\"I didn't believe it at first. But now, after two years, today, the Duke really brought it before me. You all must have contributed to this, no doubt.\"\"We are humbled.\"On behalf of everyone, Gakane responded with a slightly trembling voice. He was genuinely moved by the situation.\"I do not forget those who have worked for me. I will grant each of you five the title of 'Knight', award ten high-grade magic stones of North Mountain, and establish a training ground for the Cavalry.\"Even those who were not knights could receive the title of 'Knight'. The youngest court mages usually started from this title and gradually received higher ranks.But to not only grant a last name to all the Cavalry members but also bestow titles upon those who brought the Red Stone, it was indeed an unprecedented honor.Even Kanna, who had been so tense since arriving at the imperial palace that she hadn't been able to lift her head, couldn't hide her surprise at the moment.\"We are humbled!\"\"Your Majesty, the reward you have given my subordinates is extremely generous. But you have forgotten the most important thing. Shouldn't you also give a reward to me, who took responsibility for the beginning and end of everything?\"Kishiar, who had been quietly listening, smoothly interrupted as soon as the awards were over. Even though they were brothers, it was audacious of him to speak so lightly to the Emperor.The Cavalry members were worried that the Emperor might get angry, but that didn't happen. The Emperor, pushing his glasses, made of silver and lapis lazuli threads, up the bridge of his nose, only slightly furrowed his brow as he looked at the smiling duke.\"Duke Peletta, you have already received much help from me over the past two years. Isn't that enough?\"\"It is not enough. Did you not hear the report of over ten unidentified Awakened beasts storming into my residence? The report that the Red Stone had exploded?\"\"...\"\"I risked my life to bring this here. So, give me more.\"Gakane swallowed hard at the audacious tone. The Eldore siblings subtly sent looks of admiration. Kanna, tense, bowed her head, and Yuder quietly observed Kishiar's bewitching smile.The Emperor, who had been glaring at Kishiar, sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. Fatigue had further accumulated on his face.\"Very well. Tell me what you want so badly that you're begging so shamelessly.\"\"I want time.\"\"Time?\"The Emperor questioned back, puzzled.\"Yes. I want to examine this further.\"Yuder's heart beat rapidly for a moment. Kishiar maintained the most composed expression, looking only straight ahead. The Emperor opened his mouth, indicating his incomprehension.\"Haven't you already observed it more closely than anyone else during the recovery mission? Your task was to retrieve it, not to investigate it. Such a task should be given to the mages. It's too risky to entrust it to someone who has never done such work.\"\"Oh, Your Majesty. I thought you had read all of my report from last night, but it seems you haven't finished it yet. Do you really think those who can't even approach this box properly can investigate it well? Truly?\"Kishiar chuckled softly, provocatively retorting.\"It's the same as when you entrusted me with the recovery mission. Ultimately, the only ones who can truly perceive the power it holds are those Awakened by its power. The Cavalry has many with unique abilities, certainly they'll yield far more meaningful results than the avaricious mages. I guarantee it.\"\"...\"His flowing, unyielding argument had taken the breath away from the listeners. It felt as if anyone who didn't believe his confident proposition would be the fool.\"...And if something dangerous happens during the investigation, what then?\"\"If that happens, which it won't, I will take full responsibility.\"\"Even if you have to give up your position as the commander?\"At the Emperor's slow question, the breath of the Cavalry members hitched. Even the abundant sunlight pouring in through the large windows seemed to freeze in that moment.Yuder also furrowed his brow, not having expected the Emperor to go so far. He had assumed that as his only sibling, he would receive some leniency, but that wasn't the case. The Emperor was a much tougher opponent than he'd thought.But Kishiar alone burst into laughter as if the Emperor had just made a humorous jest.\"Are you that worried about me? I hardly know what to do with such concern at my age.\"Concern? It sounded more like a threat to everyone. The same thought flickered and passed through everyone's minds in that moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 52Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Duke of Peletta, this is no joke. Answer my question.\"\"Very well. If something unsavory occurs while my Cavalry and I are investigating, I will take responsibility and step down from my position as Commander. Does that sound acceptable?\"His response was straightforward, but it only served to harden the Emperor's already grim expression. He stared at Kishiar for a long moment before letting out a deep sigh. That sigh bore down heavily on the shoulders of the Cavalry members, like a weighty burden.\"You have ten days.\"\"That's not enough time. If you're granting a favor, please extend it a bit more.\"The Emperor's brows furrowed as if looking at a disobedient child. Yuder thought that Kishiar's audacity had finally tested the Emperor's patience, but he remained silent before speaking again.\"One month. Not a day more.\"Only then did Kishiar turn to look at his men. It was a casual gesture, as if he wanted to gauge their reaction. His gaze met Yuder's, and his expression subtly changed.Is this acceptable? His eyes seemed to ask. Yuder gave a tiny nod. Kishiar promptly straightened up and bowed.\"Your Majesty, I appreciate your understanding.\"After smoothly ending the conversation, Kishiar rose from his place. The Cavalry members quickly followed suit, straightening their bent backs and legs.\"You may now leave. I have a few matters to discuss privately with His Majesty.\"Kishiar's words were not surprising as they had been briefed before they arrived. The men did not panic and immediately bowed before the Emperor and withdrew.\"Follow me.\"As soon as they left the Emperor's presence, Nathan, with his stolid expression, raised his hand to call them. Yuder and the other men quietly followed.\"Are we returning to the carriage to wait for the Commander now?\"After they had moved a considerable distance and were about to exit the seventh palace, Hinn finally decided it was safe to voice her curiosity and asked Nathan.\"We will return to the carriage, but we won't wait for the Commander there.\"\"Then where?\"\"We're heading to the Black Pigeon in the Second Wall.\"Nathan's response was concise and calm.\"The Black Pigeon?\"\"What's that?\"\"Do you remember going to the Blue Crown when you registered for the Cavalry test? It's similar but higher up. It's where all the affairs of the nation are processed.\"In response to the curious Eldore siblings, Gakane kindly answered. True to his word, the Black Pigeon was one of the core institutions that upheld the Orr Empire. It handled administration and diplomacy, as well as all other minor affairs that needed to be dealt with in the palace.Yuder surmised that Nathan was heading there because it was probably related to the palace's internal affairs, which dealt with the running of the imperial household.'The Emperor's order will require administrative work, so the sooner, the better.'\"I see. Why is it named that way?\"\"Hmm, I'm not sure about that.....\"Gakane scratched his head and flashed an embarrassed smile. Just as Nathan, who probably knew the answer, was about to reply with an indifferent face, someone unexpectedly chimed in.\"...It's because they're constantly sending and receiving messages, working without rest. The name is an old joke that the pigeons worked so much, they didn't even have time to clean themselves, so they became black with dirt.\"\"Kanna?\"Gakane and the Eldore siblings turned in surprise. Kanna, who had been following silently with her head bowed until now, had spoken for the first time.\"How did you know that?\"\"A long time ago, I heard it somewhere.\"Kanna's response was soft and vague. Gakane and the Eldore siblings seemed to accept her answer, but Nathan closed his mouth with a peculiar expression. Yuder, too, narrowed his eyes.'She heard it somewhere...'Even if he had responded, his answer would probably have been just as evasive.However, the reason Yuder knew the answer was because he had worked and lingered in the palace in his previous life, gaining all sorts of information. A commoner, growing up normally without a family name, wouldn't have known it even by chance.Rumors associated with the name of the Blue Crown official could be picked up by the commoners living nearby. But the Black Pigeon official was different.Even Gakane, who had grown up in a reputable family, was unaware of such minor and meaningless information. What was Kanna doing knowing it? What was he supposed to think?Only then did Yuder realize that he knew absolutely nothing about Kanna's family circumstances or personal information. Thanks to his memories from his previous life, he knew at least a little about the information of the other Cavalry members, but Kanna was a person he met for the first time in this life. Unlike Gakane, she did not freely discuss her own information.He had thought her a sociable person who got along easily with any colleague, but it was surprising to realize that she had this secretive side. If even Yuder was surprised, how had the others felt?'The most likely possibilities are... she was related to someone working in the palace, or she hid her identity. It must be one of the two.'The latter was less likely. Before the last name bestowment ceremony, Kisihar would have thoroughly checked the identity of each Cavalry member to be bestowed upon.Kisihar La Orr, who seemed to be a carefree person who only knew how to laugh on the outside, was actually more meticulous and careful in his work than anyone else.It was his nature to investigate again before the bestowment ceremony, even if it was a matter that had already been investigated when accepting them into the Cavalry. So if he had investigated Kanna and concluded she was a commoner, there was no need to doubt that.Therefore, Yuder decided to put more weight on the possibility of the former.'Those who work within the palace, or who have enough access to know the detailed internal affairs, are all nobles. But in the case of the Black Pigeon official, there are also middle-ranking managers and deputies who are chosen for their competence.'In a few years, the Awakeners would break into key positions and receive titles, changing the situation, but so far, that was the structure.So if Kanna was related to one of them, the likelihood was high that she was among those of the suspected status.'It might be a completely different third possibility... Whatever the situation, I hope it's not a big problem.'Yuder's gaze turned to Kanna, who wore a dark expression. Nathan, who had been leading them silently and skillfully crossing the paths between palaces, stopped at that moment and raised a hand.\"We are nearing the boundary of the wall. I will represent us during the inspection, so all you need to do is stay quiet behind me.\"As they had been riding the imperial carriage until now and hadn't had to face an inspection directly, a slight tension swept over the faces of the members. As Nathan had said, the inspection post was soon revealed.Inside the first wall, where only the imperial family resided in the palace, it was extremely quiet, with hardly anyone wishing to come or go. The expressions of the knights guarding the checkpoint were utterly relaxed.\"I'd like to head towards the second wall.\"\"What is your name?\"\"I am Nathan Zuckerman, an adjutant of Duke Peletta.\"The knights' gaze shifted from Nathan, who was clad in armor adorned with the duke's family crest, towards the Cavalry members wearing identical black uniforms. They merely glanced at the Cavalry members, not bothering to ask for their names.\"Understood. Please pass through.\"The members of the Cavalry were surprised at how easily they were granted passage. Yuder realized from the knights' glances that they had assumed the Cavalry members were new recruits brought along by Nathan, but he decided to say nothing.After all, Nathan had probably anticipated this and had offered to undergo the checkpoint procedures first. Being mistaken was actually beneficial for them as it expedited the checkpoint process.Nathan courteously bowed his head in a gesture of acknowledgment before striding past the checkpoint without hesitation.As soon as they passed through the checkpoint, the path widened dramatically, and the number of people passing by exploded. Huge buildings of various architectural styles were revealed.The empire's court, built immediately after the founding of the empire, was clean and majestic with a single floor, while the new building of the Palace Magic Corps boasted a dizzying height of over ten floors. They were side by side, forming a harmonious blend that was typical of the second wall district.'An area where all the institutions representing the empire gather...'Yuder murmured the nickname of the area within the second wall as he looked around.'It's been a while. With time, the Cavalry headquarters will appear among them.'He turned his head towards the location where the Cavalry headquarters had been in his memory. Now, it was just an inconspicuous small auxiliary palace. In his previous life, that palace had been expanded and increased in floors to become the Cavalry headquarters.The headquarters managed the operations of the Cavalry branches scattered throughout the empire and took on missions requiring coordination with other institutions. Yuder's official office had also been located there.\"Have we already crossed the wall?\"\"I didn't see anything, how did that happen?\"Eldore siblings, who were distracted by the surrounding scenery, belatedly realized that they had fully entered the second district and were taken aback. Nathan, who had been walking silently, seemed to think he should answer their question, so he slightly slowed his pace and opened his mouth.\"We have already crossed the wall.\"\"When?\"\"Just after we passed the checkpoint. The first wall is said to be in the form of a road paved with special magical stones, forming a circle and covering the entire area. They built a garden over it to deliberately conceal it, so it's natural that you wouldn't have noticed its existence.\"\"Ah...\"Only then did the Eldore siblings' expressions change, as if they had just remembered that the garden around the Sun Palace had been unusually long. Gakane, who had been quietly listening, also seemed excited by this new information, his cheeks flushing slightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"If passing through is this simple, anyone could infiltrate the First Wall. Isn't His Majesty too exposed to danger?\"\"No, that's not the case. The First Wall is more secure against outside intrusion than any other.\"\"How so?\"\"Well...\"Nathan was about to answer when he closed his mouth, his gaze drawn to the massive gate visible in the near distance.\"We've arrived at the Black Pigeon. You'll gradually learn more about the walls as you accumulate experience.\"The Black Pigeon was one of the more spacious institutions within the second district. Numerous visitors and officials scurried between the complex of buildings, and messenger pigeons, each with a small tube attached to its leg, flitted ceaselessly between the open windows and rooftops.While they weren't black pigeons, as the name suggested, the constant movement of the messenger pigeons gave a clear hint to the origin of the name.Nathan exchanged a few words with the guard at the entrance before he returned.\"We need to head to the Inner Palace, which manages the affairs of the Imperial Palace. Shall we?\"As Yuder had suspected, Nathan seemed to have come with the intention of delivering the Emperor's directive and receiving any necessary replies. The Inner Palace was one of the nearest buildings, so they were almost there.\"Wait, just a moment. Sir Nathan!\"Just as they were about to follow Nathan, Kanna suddenly raised her voice from behind. She stood rooted to the spot, stubbornly lowering her head as she continued to speak.\"I feel... my physical condition has suddenly worsened. If it's alright, could I rest here for a while? It's not necessary for all of us to go there, right?\"Kanna's pale face looked truly sickly, but Yuder didn't believe her. Given her peculiar behavior since before they arrived at the Imperial Palace, her words were almost certainly a lie. Nathan also seemed to think the same, tilting his head with a calm expression.\"...It might be dangerous to stay here alone.\"\"No, it won't be dangerous. We're in second district, who would harm me here? I just need to sit on that bench over there for a moment, and I should be fine. Still... is that not okay?\"Cold sweat glistened on Kanna's face as she shook her head. Nathan remained silent in response, seemingly pondering whether to directly ask Kanna about the reason for her strange behavior.'He must be quite troubled about how to handle a newcomer from a different department.'Nathan was merely an adjutant of Duke Peletta, strictly speaking, not a member of the Cavalry. Dealing with people outside of one's own department was always a tricky task, and Kanna was even a newcomer. It was quite reasonable that he would be unsure about how to address someone who might not even know the palace's rules.'Besides, he can't afford to waste much time considering we have a place to visit immediately.'Having thought this far, Yuder quickly came to a conclusion.'It seems I should stay back.'The Nathan that Yuder remembered was not particularly eloquent. Yuder was no different, but he had a better rapport with Kanna, thus he was less likely to upset her.The reason was unknown, but seeing Kanna reluctant to go into the inner palace suggested that the cause of the problem might lie there. Therefore, it seemed much better for him to stay and converse with her, attempting to uncover the cause of her unusual behavior.\"I'll stay here with Kanna. Wouldn't that be acceptable?\"\"...\"\"No, no, it's fine Yuder! You don't need to...\"\"Kanna, it's dangerous to leave an unwell comrade alone, no matter where. But if there are two of us, even Nathan would worry less.\"Confronted with Yuder's meaningful gaze, Kanna fell silent.Quick-witted as she was, she realized it was better to compromise and heed Yuder's words rather than persist stubbornly. However, seeing her reaction, other squad members stepped up as well.\"Hey, if we don't have to go, I'll stay here and protect Kanna too.\"\"Me too. If all we need to do is quietly wait here, right?\"\"I want to help, too. I won't move an inch from here.\"As the squad members quickly grew louder, Nathan furrowed his brow.\"Your camaraderie is impressive... but I can't leave everyone here. If you really need to rest because you're unwell, it would be best to ask the Commander's assistant for help. I'll leave it to you.\"Nathan was not a fool. He had roughly understood the hidden meaning in Yuder's words and seemed to judge it better to leave Kanna with him.If all the Cavalry stayed, a tense Kanna might not open up, but with only one person, her guard could be considerably lowered, especially if it was a familiar comrade.Furthermore, by mentioning the role of the Commander\u2019s assistant as a reason to leave Yuder alone, he had cut off any chance of rebuttal. There was likely no room for further discussion.\"I understand.\"As Yuder had predicted, the remaining three members, although disappointed, soon accepted the situation. Leaving words of care for Kanna, they followed Nathan inside.\"We'll be back soon, so wait quietly over there!\"Yuder watched their retreating figures until they disappeared from sight, then turned his head. Kanna's face was still full of anxiety. A brief glimpse of extreme fear could be felt in her eyes as she surveyed the passing people.\"Now that it's just the two of us, can you tell me honestly what's going on?\"\"What? What are you talking about? Nothing's wrong. I'm just not feeling well......\"Startled by Yuder's words, Kanna lowered her head, but no one would believe her words. Yuder, looking at her in terror, sighed softly.'I wouldn't have cared in the past.'But now was different. He was the one who brought Kanna into the Cavalry. Therefore, he had to take responsibility for this unusual situation.\"Did you betray the Cavalry?\"Staring at her quietly, Yuder suddenly asked a question. Kanna's eyes widened and her mouth dropped open.\"What?\"\"Or did you kill an innocent person?\"\"No!\"\"Then there should be no problem for you, Kanna. The reason I remain here is to help you. Don't tell me you think nobody noticed your peculiar behavior? The sooner you reveal it, the more time we'll have to devise a plan. No matter what you say, I'm certain I won't be surprised, so I wish you'd speak up.\"Kanna could only look at Yuder's composed face, lost for words. From the moment Yuder hinted he'd stay with her, she'd anticipated he would say something, but she hadn't expected to hear such words.Yuder's voice was always calm and cool, yet it held a peculiar power, as if imbued with strange magic. Upon hearing about going to the imperial palace, even the thoughts that had been tormenting her seemed ready to fly away momentarily.But if there really had been no problem... such an event wouldn't have occurred. Kanna bit her lip and lowered her head, temporarily wavering. She regained her composure just as she was about to open her mouth.Her anxiety being discovered was embarrassing, but this wasn't the sort of issue that could be improved by telling others.\"Really... it's nothing... it's not even something worth getting help for.\"'Saying it's not worth getting help for, it must be related to her personal affairs.'Yuder could clearly see what was going through Kanna's mind. If it had been like before, he would've had his underlings investigate the troubled individual and solve the problem, but now, being alone, he couldn't. However, that didn't mean there was nothing he could do.\"Who is it?\"\"Huh?\"\"Seeing as you don't want to enter the palace, I guess the cause must be there. Who is it? Family? Relative? Friend?\"\"What, what are you talking about, Yuder?\"\"The most likely is family.\"The awkward smile that had been on Kanna's face vanished in an instant. Seeing her tightly clasp her pale hands and look lost, he knew he had hit the mark.\"I really don't know what you're trying to say. Stop talking nonsense. We told Sir Nathan we'd be waiting quietly on the bench. I, I'll sit.\"\"Kanna, a problem of a Cavalry member soon becomes a problem for the whole Cavalry. Sir Nathan has noticed the anomaly too, so it's only a matter of time before the Commander finds out and asks. Is that what you want?\"\"...\"Kanna's steps faltered.\"We can end it quickly before the Commander finds out if you tell me now. Who is it in this place that's causing you to act like this?\"The two figures, noticeably dressed in black uniforms and raising their voices, attracted quite a bit of attention at the entrance of the Black Pigeon, where many people were coming and going. Of course, Yuder had intended for this to happen, though the response came quicker than expected.\"But I told you, it's nothing...!\"\"Kanna?\"Hearing the sudden voice behind her, Kanna froze and clenched her jaw.Yuder saw a middle-aged man and his servant standing suspiciously behind her. They had apparently just arrived, their carriage still behind them.'That's him.'In an instant, Yuder sensed a blood relation between the man and Kanna. The neatly groomed, slightly greying hair at the temples, the overall golden-brown locks identical to Kanna's, and the highly similar facial features.Crucially, the man was dressed in the uniform worn by the palace's internal managers. He might have appeared gentle and elegant like a noble gentleman on the surface, but his eyes were as cold and arrogant as the winter wind, leaving an unfavorable impression.\"Kanna. I didn't want to believe it, but it really is you. I can't believe it.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With each soft sound of the staff's end meeting the ground, the color drained from Kanna's face.Having ascertained this, Yuder reached for the hood hanging on Kanna's uniform and pulled it over her head. The moment the large hood concealed her face, Kanna gasped and swallowed.\"Don't say a word.\"Yuder murmured softly, just loud enough for her to hear, then stepped forward towards the approaching man. This position naturally allowed him to shield Kanna behind him.\"What's going on here?\"\"Who are you?\"Despite not knowing Yuder's affiliation or status, the man talked down to him. This meant he was looking at him in a belittling manner.\"I am Yuder Aile, affiliated with the Cavalry. And you are?\"\"The Cavalry?\"The man tilted his head as if hearing the name for the first time, then let out a sound of realization a moment later.\"Ah, right. That group collected by His Grace, Duke Peletta\u2026\"He left the rest unsaid, but the underlying tone was clearly negative. Yuder coldly looked at his face while subtly glancing down at his gloved hand.'He dares to ignore my question twice. In the past, I would have immediately forced him to his knees...'Not that he couldn't do it now. His hand itched to act, but the sound of shaky breaths from the hooded figure behind him held him back.\"There's no need for pleasantries. The woman behind you is from my household. She committed a crime recently and ran away. We couldn't find her until now. Step aside, so I can take her.\"Kanna's trembling breaths abruptly stopped. Yuder briefly glanced back at her before returning his gaze to the man. Seeing Yuder's nonchalant demeanor, the man commanded with a ruthless attitude once more.\"Didn't you hear me? I said to step aside.\"\"Heh, don't you hear the Count's words? Step aside!\"The servant standing next to the man also raised his voice. Nevertheless, Yuder remained stationary, not budging an inch.\"Are you deaf?\"\"There's no need for you to deal with these lowly beings yourself, Master. I will go...\"\"Can you prove it?\"Finally, Yuder spoke.\"What?\"\"How can you assure that the person behind me is the one you've been looking for?\"The moment Yuder's deep, gloomy voice echoed through the air, everyone who had been watching felt a chilling intensity that made them shiver uncontrollably.The man who introduced himself as Yuder Aile felt incongruous, like a single incorrectly placed piece in a perfect puzzle.Two pitiless eyes under jet-black hair. The dark shadow cast beneath them was terrifying, as if merely meeting his gaze could steal away one's soul. His ghostly pale face was equally unnerving.Yet, this ominous and intense emotion made it impossible for anyone to look away from Yuder. No one had paid him any attention until now, but once recognized, everything about him appeared different.Despite being right in front of them, he seemed like a shadow with no presence - appearing inconsequential yet, upon closer inspection, swallowing something terrifying like the darkness. Someone unconsciously swallowed their saliva.Who on earth was this person? Many who hadn't heard Yuder's self-introduction simultaneously wondered.\"Sir...You cover her with a hat to hide her, and now you want to argue?\"The servant who had been confidently trying to drag Kanna from behind Yuder stuttered, barely managing a response. He didn't even realize he had unconsciously used honorific language.\"You came out of nowhere and tried to take her without even confirming whether she's the person you're looking for. I didn't know that a nobleman of the palace, like yourself, could just take anyone within the imperial palace without even revealing their name.\"Yuder didn't show the slightest sign of fear or confusion. His chilly words caused a murmur to spread among the crowd.\"A nobleman from the palace?\"\"A nobleman was trying to take someone? Who is it?\"Realizing that the attention of the crowd was focused on his master, the servant's face turned pale.\"Ma... Master.\"Contempt and anger dwelled in the eyes of the Count, who resembled Kanna. If there had been no witnesses, he would have simply ignored the situation and done as he pleased. Unfortunately, this was in front of the Black Pigeon, one of the busiest places in District 2.Once the attention had been drawn, he had to act considering his status and dignity.\"It seems there's a misunderstanding. My servant must have misspoken, but he didn't mean it. I am Hank Gallon, a Second Class Official of the palace.\"He was still condescending, but his tone had changed to a somewhat polite one, seemingly mindful of the onlookers. Yuder searched his memory for the name Gallon.'Gallon... Gallon. Right. He was a Count, that much is certain.'To perform all sorts of secret missions close to the emperor, one had to be well aware of the political landscape both inside and outside the empire.Remembering all the influential families in the empire was part of the necessary preparations for this. Yuder ransacked his memory before speaking.\"So, you are Count Gallon.\"\"I apologize for the sudden request, but that woman you saw earlier is undoubtedly a member of my household that I lost. If you allow me to confirm her face, it will quickly become clear whether my claim is correct.\"The only information about Count Gallon that remained in Yuder's memory was that his family had lived quietly in the capital for a long time. Even if they had never been at the center of politics, they had neither taken the initiative to cause trouble. They seemed to have conducted themselves wisely.Moreover, the palace was a place where only nobles with at least five generations of confirmed lineage could enter, as they directly handled imperial affairs. The power they could wield was limited, but it was good for elevating their honor.'He didn't refer to her as a blood relative, but specifically as a member of his household. This means their relationship isn't something that can be openly discussed.'Considering Kanna's reaction, it was clear that she had been acting strange since arriving here, perhaps fearing she would encounter this person. Yuder made up his mind and shook his head with a brazen expression.\"I'm afraid that won't be possible.\"\"Excuse me?\"\"My companion comes from humble origins, and has just recently received a last name and recognition from His Majesty. Why are you so sure that she belongs to your family, Count? Our Cavalry verifies the identity of all its members, so it's hard to believe there's a criminal among us. What is this crime you speak of in the first place?\"\"...There's no need for you to know.\"\"Then naturally, I cannot hand over my companion. To doubt my companion is to doubt our Commander, Duke Peletta. ...Did you come to us with some ulterior motive, Count?\"The people around them murmured as he let his words flow without hesitation. His argument seemed logical and hinted at various meanings.Was the person implying that the Count had an ulterior motive, that this was a family issue, or was there a hidden intention against Duke Peletta? Or was this just some lustful scheme targeted at a woman who had caught his eye? Tension crept into the hand of the Count, clutching his cane, as curious eyes watched.\"How dare you question my master's intentions!\"\"You stand back.\"Count Gallon waved his servant away. But his seemingly gentle fa\u00e7ade had long since hardened with anger.\"I tried to be respectful, but the way you speak is utterly vulgar. Does your audacity stem from the foolish belief that you're backed by someone of great power?\"\"Then why not answer my question? How could my companion behind me possibly be a criminal who has slipped through your fingers?\"\"I've already told you. If you remove the hat and reveal the face, all will be clear.\"\"Answer me first. How will I know the truth if you only speak after you've seen?\"The firm response from Yuder, hinting that he couldn't trust the Count, drove Count Gallon to the brink of fury.If it were up to him, he would have immediately summoned the palace knights to accomplish his goal. However, he had no choice but to hesitate as more and more eyes turned towards them.\"What did you say? A Count of the palace is eyeing a woman? Targeting someone who works here? How bold, under the watchful eye of the Sun Palace.\"\"No, they're from the Cavalry. You know, the place that Duke Peletta established a few months ago that caused quite a stir.\"\"But why is someone from there in a confrontation with the Count?\"\"I think he mentioned something about a family issue, but I don't know the details.\"Every noble values their reputation and safety above all else. Even if the emperor's health wasn't the best, everything that happened within the palace would reach his ears. The four major ducal families were even more cautious.The House of Count Gallon had managed to stay unscathed and cleverly navigate through the politics without allying with anyone. It wasn't their intention to stir up unnecessary controversy and expose their weaknesses.They couldn't afford to reveal their family's secrets to everyone over the pursuit of a young runaway girl.In the end, Count Gallon decided to take a step back.\"You said you're from the Cavalry, didn't you? Today is not the day, but I will pay a visit there soon. Once I speak with Duke Peletta, the truth will be crystal clear.\"Even at the veiled threat, Yuder's expression remained calm. His indifferent and arrogant demeanor, as if such words were no concern to him, made the Count grind his teeth in frustration.\"I'll remember your name.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Do as you will.\"In his previous life, there were many who vowed to remember the name of Yuder. However, none among them could lay a finger on him.\"That... that man until the end... Master! Please wait!\"The servant cried out with a horrified face and then dashed after the Count, who had turned his body, stirring up a cold breeze, towards the palace interior. Those who had been spectating lost interest and dispersed when Yuder showed no reaction.However, a few of them remained, observing Yuder and Kanna with interest. An old man who approached Yuder was among them.\"Do you know this? The Count Gallon's family has held their title for seven generations, and their main house is within the fourth wall, powerful enough to be in the inner sector.\"Kanna, who was behind Yuder, stiffened. A weak-looking young man, seemingly accompanying the old man, was watching them, not knowing what to do. Yuder gazed at the old man's face for a moment, then slowly smiled.\"And what does that have to do with me?\"\"You're not afraid of making a powerful enemy by hiding your comrade?\"\"If I were to put it bluntly, I'd say it's the other way around.\"\"The other way around?\"The old man, his long white beard giving him an imposing air, evoked the image of a dignified noble family head in his traditional attire. Anyone else might have been intimidated by his presence, but there was no change in Yuder's expression.\"You see, he has made a formidable enemy in me.\"\"Ha! Such confidence. May I ask what gives you the nerve to say such a thing?\"Why wouldn't he? Yuder opened his mouth with a cool smile.\"Of course, it's the power I possess.\"\"...\"The old man's eyebrows twitched. A moment later, he burst into hearty laughter, full of admiration.\"Power that transcends status and influence! I'd like to witness this formidable power myself. I hope your words aren't empty promises.\"After saying this, the old man patted Yuder's shoulder and headed towards the young man, who had been waiting anxiously.\"Master. You always say that watching a fight is the best, but why did you get involved here? I'm utterly embarrassed...! Do you realize how late we are? By now, everyone else would have gathered...!\"\"You fool. What does it matter if I'm late? I've seen the most interesting thing here. How could I simply walk away from that?\"\"But...!\"\"Quiet, and lead the way, boy.\"Yuder quietly watched the young man and the old man bicker and disappear, then turned his head. As if she had been waiting for this moment, Kanna spoke up.\"Yuder. Why did you do that?\"A small voice came from behind Yuder. Kanna was clutching his clothes tightly with her trembling hands. Yuder turned to face her.\"That's why, isn't it? The reason you didn't want to come here.\"\"Why would you do something like that? You have no idea how tenacious and terrifying that man is! How are we going to handle this...?\"Instead of an answer, a deep sense of despair returned. It was as good as any answer.\"I... I'll speak to the Commander. I'll tell him you're not at fault, Yuder. And I can resign before he comes... Yes, that might work...\"\"Resign?\"Yuder turned toward Kanna, who was making an absurd claim, and spoke firmly.\"Why are you trying to quit the squad?\"\"But you heard him. He said he would come to the Cavalry...! Aren't you worried?\"Kanna retorted, seemingly unable to understand.\"Didn't you hear what the other person said earlier? About what kind of person Count Gallon is? He\u2019s a terrifying person. Really, truly terrifying.\"Kanna's fear of Count Gallon seemed to run quite deep. What had she experienced? Yuder lightly tapped on her trembling shoulder, redirecting her gaze back to him.\"It's okay. If he doesn't come, I'd be more disappointed. I introduced myself hoping for that.\"\"What?\"\"It doesn't matter at all what power his family holds. All I'm curious about is your story. Kanna, what is your relationship with that family?\"\"Right. I'm quite curious about that situation too. I wish you would tell us soon.\"A soft voice interrupted from behind Yuder. At that moment, Kanna retreated in surprise.\"Co-Commander?\"Yuder saw Kishiar, wearing a large purple robe typically worn by court mages, slowly emerging from the shade of the trees.His striking appearance and outfit suited to conceal his white uniform were one thing, but the surprise was something else. Kanna mumbled with her mouth agape.\"When did you...? No, rather, why are you dressed like that...?\"\"Haha. Don't worry about it.\"\"Have you finished your conversation with His Majesty? Where did you leave the box and the carriage?\"Kishiar shrugged with a smirk at Yuder's sharp question, who, far from being surprised by his appearance, was rather unflustered.\"You're never surprised, which makes things quite boring. The carriage is where it was left, and His Majesty is briefly examining the box. But more importantly, wouldn't you like to discuss this interesting information about a squad member's secret that even I was unaware of?\"Seeing Kishiar's laughter, Kanna's face turned pale again.\"I...I...\"\"Hold on. If we talk here, we might draw attention. Come this way. There's a perfect place to talk inside there.\"Kishiar leisurely led them and entered the Black Pigeon office through the main entrance. Given the large number of people coming and going, no one recognized or stopped them.Kishiar, who was walking amidst the crowd, suddenly slipped into a very narrow space between two buildings.From the outside, it seemed too narrow for anyone to pass, but as they followed him, a path wide enough for a person to walk appeared as if by magic. The narrow gap they'd seen was an illusion created by the overlapping building and shadows.Upon exiting, surprisingly, a very small open space appeared.\"When buildings are continually constructed and inserted over a long period of time, occasionally unnoticed gaps like this are created. No one will come here, so feel free to talk.\"Even Yuder, who was quite familiar with the palace's geography, had never seen this place. It was astonishing.\"How did you know about this place?\"\"Forgot, did you? I was born and raised here. Exploring the palace was my favorite pastime as a child.\"The Imperial Palace extended to the Second Wall, but the palaces where the emperor and the imperial family resided were mostly within the First Wall. It was unthinkable that a young, noble prince would venture beyond the First Wall for exploration and play.It was a staggering answer, but it seemed all the more surprising because it was plausible, considering it was Kishiar.\"I'm really sorry, Commander. I didn't mean to cause any trouble for the Cavalry or you. I just... I needed a place to hide.\"In the quiet courtyard, Kanna finally removed her large hat with trembling hands and revealed her face. The first thing she did was to bow deeply in apology.\"A place to hide. From Gallon House?\"At Kishiar's question, Kanna nodded difficultly.\"Yes. I don't see any point in hiding anything anymore. As you've probably guessed, I lived in Gallon House. Count Hank Gallon would have been my... father, but I never called him that.\"Kanna's story wasn't too different from what Yuder had anticipated. She was born to a maid with whom Hank Gallon had spent a night. The Count did not give Kanna a name or a surname. It was a statement of his complete refusal to recognize her as his own flesh and blood.Her mother, with a bit of money she received when expelled, rented a small house in the Seventh Wall and raised her daughter. However, three years ago, when her mother died of illness, Kanna had to return to her birth house, where she lived a life of contempt, treated not as a daughter but as a maid.\"I thought that kind of life was better than living alone. But... my thoughts changed after I awakened a year ago.\"Kanna's ability was to read the information of objects. One day, while cleaning, she accidentally discovered the dark intentions of Count Hank through the objects she touched. He intended to hand her over to another noble, at any age.That noble was known for his vicious and despicable personality, and even though Hank knew that Kanna would likely die if she was given to him, he didn't care. The political gain he would receive by doing so was his priority.The moment she read that terrifying intent, she shivered. From that moment, Kanna began to plan how to escape from the Count's house.\"At first, I planned to flee to a foreign country. But then the Cavalry recruitment announcement came out... I decided to try out, and if I failed, I would change my plan and head abroad.\"But, to her surprise, Kanna passed. Thanks to Yuder's advice.\"I knew the Count worked at the Imperial Palace, and I was scared that I might run into him if I went there. If I was found, he would definitely recognize me and try to take me away immediately. But... considering how things turned out, I think it would be better for me to resign before he comes looking for me in the Cavalry. ...That's all.\"After Kanna finished speaking, silence fell among the three.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Yuder recalled the moment he first met Kanna, seeing the bitterness in her expression.When he first met her at the front of the Blue Crown for the Cavalry's entrance test, Yuder thought of her as a rigid and angry person. He simply thought that she was the type of person whose face would show such an expression when she was overly nervous, but that was not the case. After hearing her current story, he finally understood why her expression was so severe.For Kanna, that moment was a once-in-a-lifetime choice and challenge.After telling her entire story, Kanna's eyes conveyed more unease and sadness than the refreshing feeling of someone who had spilled her secrets. She bowed her head silently in front of Kishiar, like a criminal waiting for her punishment.\"What were you planning to do next if you left the Cavalry?\"Kishiar's first question was very succinct. Kanna blinked blankly, perhaps taken aback by his unexpected response, and finally opened her mouth.\"As I originally planned... I'm thinking about going abroad.\"\"With your abilities, it won't be easy to become a mercenary, will it?\"\"I was thinking of joining a wandering theater troupe. I think I would do well as a fortune teller.\"\"I see. That would have been fine. You've thought hard about it.\"\"\u2026Pardon?\"As Kanna asked with a puzzled face, Kishiar's voice suddenly turned cold.\"But Kanna Wand, don't you think the members who have known you will miss you a lot if you suddenly leave the troop?\"'Kishiar La Orr, why does he keep saying such strange things?'Kanna's abilities were essential to investigate the Red Stone. Her abilities were much more promising than she thought.How could a wandering theater troupe dare to compare with the safe and glorious Cavalry? Even if she really committed a crime and was dragged away, they had to stop it at all costs. Yuder was not pleased with what Kishiar was saying.As Yuder's eyes secretly sparkled, Kanna opened her mouth with a look of determination.\"If they miss me, I would be really grateful and sad. I was really happy while I was in the Cavalry, and it was fun to meet good colleagues. I owe a great debt to the Commander who accepted me and to Yuder, who helped me in many ways, which I can never repay. However, for that reason, I think it's right for me to leave the troop for the Commander, Yuder, and my colleagues. If I have to be punished for lying about my background as an orphan with no family when I joined, I am willing to accept any punishment.\"Her eyes were filled with sadness, but her face was incredibly calm and dignified when she said it was right for her to leave.\"You are willing to accept any punishment?\"\"Yes.\"\"If you're willing to accept it, there's no need to refuse.\"\"Commander.\"Yuder called Kishiar, frowning. However, the moment their eyes met when Kishiar turned his head to his call, Yuder realized that he had misunderstood something.He didn't realize it because his voice was so serious, but there was a mischievous glint in his red eyes that he was facing.\"My members are strange. I've worked so hard for two years to build the Cavalry, but the talented ones who have passed through numerous competitors all seem to have no attachment to the Cavalry.\"\"...\"\"I don't know whether my eyes are strange, or the members are strange.\"Kanna, who had been hanging her head, slowly rolled her eyes upward, seeming perplexed by the odd remark. Kishiar looked down at her with languid eyes, a leisurely smile on his face, and opened his mouth.\"So, Kanna Wand. Your punishment is to become the Deputy Commander of Jung Division.\"\"... Pardon?\"\"To be frank, one who has not received the last name can't be considered a family, so you didn't tell a lie. Regardless of what Count Gallon says, you can't leave the Cavalry. But you asked for the punishment yourself. You tried to leave the supposedly blissful Cavalrt so easily, so you have no choice but to work hard and pay for your sins.\"\"But, but Commander. What does that mean? I...\"Kanna was about to retort with a startled expression, but Kishiar cut her off with a decisive wave of his hand.\"That's the end of it. No more words are necessary. Go back.\"Yuder finally let out a sigh of relief. As he followed Kishiar, who turned without hesitation, Kanna shouted in confusion from behind.\"Commander. How did you understand my words just now? Me, a deputy, absolutely not. Yuder! Say something!\"\"It's better than being an assistant.\"\"What?\"\"What are you saying?\" Kanna shouted, but Yuder did not answer.He didn't want to admit that he had spoken of leaving the division like Kanna, refused Kishiar's offer, but ended up becoming the Commander's assistant.'Well, that aside\u2026 appointing a deputy in Jung division wasn\u2019t something I recall from my previous life.'In Kishiar's time as the Commander, he didn't appoint a deputy in the Jung division, which had a critically low number of members. Later, when Yuder took over the position and the Jung division grew, a deputy position was added. However, he didn't expect it to happen again now.The reason Kishiar made Kanna the deputy of a division with only ten members was probably not because the role was genuinely needed.It was more likely an act of consideration to lessen her burden and make her stay in the Cavalry more comfortable. But this again changed the future Yuder knew. It was a positive result.\"Yuder Aile.\"\"Yes.\"\"What were you planning to do with that power of yours when Count Gallon came to the Cavalry?\"While contemplating, Kishiar suddenly started talking. Yuder kept silent for a moment, then briefly glanced around to check where Kanna was. She was slowly following from quite a distance. It seemed safe enough to respond.\"I was planning... to give him a bit of a hand.\"\"How much is 'a bit' in your terms?\"\"Enough for rumors to circulate that anyone who messes with a member of the Cavalry won't be able to leave in one piece.\"Hearing Yuder's response, Kishiar tilted his head with a peculiar smile.\"Who do you think will clean up after that?\"\"Didn't you say you would take good care of your assistant, sir?\"He boldly retorted, implying that surely he couldn't handle even that much. Laziness, like a well-fed beast, shimmered above Kishiar's red eyes.\"That's right. I did say that.\"The Cavalry needed a strong presence and reputation now more than ever. Even with all kinds of praise from the Emperor, it would still only be known to those in the know.To make the existence of the Cavalry widely known across the continent, it was necessary to create a few noisy episodes.In his previous life, the event that had marked the beginning of that saga was when Kishiar announced he was the owner of the divine sword. However, in this life, that incident had not occurred. But what if an incident involving a malicious nobleman being soundly beaten and chased away by the Cavalry members trying to protect a comrade occurred?Even if it couldn't match the saga of the divine sword, the world would be profoundly shocked by the fact that commoners could dare to do such a thing to a nobleman and face no repercussions whatsoever.'And they would never forget the name of the Cavalry.'It seemed that Kishiar, too, had already done that level of calculation, hence his amusement.What would the nobleman's pretentious face look like after experiencing a disgrace that would forever stain his history? Yuder felt a rare sense of satisfaction and silently curled up the corners of his mouth.\"Then, I take it you approve.\"\"Don't keep all the fun to yourself. Invite this onlooker too. Is there anything more entertaining than watching a fight?\"A fight to watch. Upon hearing those words, Yuder remembered the old man and the young man he had met earlier. He had recognized who the old man was, a man who loved to watch fights, the moment he saw him.'Thais Yulman, one of the elders of the Pearl Tower, an Archmage. I didn't expect him to be visiting the imperial palace at this time.'Unlike other mages who had been honored with the title of Archmage, Thais wasn't proficient in attribute magic. He had gained his fame solely due to his diverse research results aimed at piercing the essence of the world through magic.He had proven that air and magic were different, and he had researched the differences between materials created by magic and real nature.Even though he couldn't use attack magic, it was well-known that nobody was better than him when it came to breaking down magic.Why would Thais Yulman, of all people, have come to the imperial palace? Moreover, why was he dressed like an ordinary noble old man instead of wearing the robe exclusive to mages of the Pearl Tower?'Well, considering his timing and his expertise, the conclusion is obvious.'Simply put, he may have just wanted to visit quietly without revealing his identity and meet the court mages of the Orr Empire.However, an Archmage who specializes in magic research appearing in the imperial palace as soon as the Red Stone was retrieved was a clear sign of his objective, wasn't it?Thais Yulman probably rushed here from the Pearl Tower the moment he heard the news of the successful retrieval of the Red Stone. He must have been unable to bear his desire to immediately take the stone and study it. His will could be considered the will of the entire Pearl Tower.'Kishiar must have secretly reported the retrieval to the Emperor alone, but for some reason, it feels like the news has already spread across the entire continent.'In his previous life, when he investigated the Red Stone, he could not find out who had refined the stone in the Pearl Tower. The information within the Pearl Tower was top secret.Moreover, by the time Yuder had started his investigation, several years had already passed since the collapse and ruin of the tower. Even whether Thais Yulman was dead or alive by then was unknown.'Thais Yulman... I'll have to remember that.'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57\"...I'm glad that your taste aligns with mine. It makes me feel that the effort to bring you on as my assistant was worthwhile.\"\"Pardon?\"Yuder was preoccupied with thoughts about Thais Yulman, and had missed Kishiar's comment. He turned his head a little too late to ask again, only to find that Kishiar was also looking in his direction with a slight tilt of his head.Their faces had stopped at a very close distance.\"...\"In that instant, Yuder's gaze was seized by Kishiar's face. Kishiar, too, blinked, staring back at Yuder.After a short pause, it was Kishiar who first broke away from the gaze and flashed a smile.\"We almost bumped into each other.\"\"Oh, yes.\"Yuder finally regained his senses and turned his head away.\"Did you fall for my face up close? You were looking rather passionately.\"The unfamiliar short pang Yuder had felt shattered instantly.\"No, that's never happened.\"Despite his immediate, firm denial, Kishiar persisted as if he had a winning hand.\"You didn't? Weren't you just looking?\"\"I never did.\"\"I should have just bumped into you. It seemed like a perfect angle for a kiss.\"Yuder felt a sudden chill in his spine and inadvertently looked back again. Fortunately, Kanna seemed to still be following from a distance, seemingly engrossed in her own pleasant thoughts.\"Making such comments to anyone could lead to unnecessary misunderstandings. Please refrain. I am your assistant.\"What was the point of making such a joke to Yuder, who had yet to awaken his second gender?Although he had accepted the position of assistant, there was clearly nothing more than that. The future would not be like the past.\"Anyone? That's a bit hurtful. Are you 'anyone'?\"Kishiar, who didn't care about other people's feelings, couldn't suppress a small chuckle, shaking his shoulders as he slowed down and quietly fell behind Yuder. It seemed he just wanted to tease.\"Alright, I won't do it anymore. Don't purposely distance yourself. Weren't we just happily discussing plans together?\"\"....\"\"Choosing you as my assistant seems like a good decision. I think we'll make a great team, don't you think?\"Kishiar had an extraordinary talent for expressing the same phrase in a strikingly different manner. As Yuder sighed lightly, Kishiar laughed once more.Looking at his laughing face, Yuder thought about the indescribable feeling he had just experienced. It was a face he had seen countless times, in his previous life and in this one he had returned to.But something was different this time.Was it the man with such vibrant eyes? He had always thought of him as someone whose smile concealed a world-weary blade and suppressed fatigue, but Kishiar's face up close showed none of that.It should be natural, given that he had returned to a past where nothing had happened yet, but this ordinary fact was shocking.The image of Kishiar in his dream, who had joked with a lonely face, empty as if it had been hollowed out, reemerged. It seemed as if he had just seen what that Kishiar, who had been facing death, had lost.Yuder instinctively raised his hand to his chest and pressed it lightly, then quickly pulled it away.He still did not know how to express the feeling he had just experienced.\u2014---That day, Kanna shared her past with her comrades in the carriage, briefly but confidently. The members, who had been deeply worried about her, all felt a strong resentment towards Count Gallon. They comforted Kanna and pledged to keep everything she had shared a secret.Kishiar returned holding the Red Stone in the box, just as he had when he first arrived at the imperial palace. The next day, he appointed deputy commanders and an assistant in front of all the members.\"Shin's deputy commander, Ever Beck. Sul's deputy commander, Steiber Rendley. Jung's deputy commander, Kanna Wand. And the Cavalry assistant, Yuder Aile. These four people will divide the duties of the commander and help each other.\"Among the three deputy commanders, the only one who didn't have a close relationship with Yuder was Steiber of Sul. However, Yuder already knew what kind of person he was through the memories of his previous life.Steiber was the oldest among the current members. He was a simple bakery owner and the head of a household, who was over 40. He had exceptional ability to handle water and was well-liked.In his previous life, Yuder had been the deputy commander of Sul, hence Steiber was a regular member without any special duties. However, the members of Sul respected Steiber more than Yuder.Yuder thought that Steiber Rendley would make a good deputy commander, and he once again admired Kishiar's insight. Kishiar seemed to know how the dynamics among the members flowed, and who stood out in what area, although it seemed like he didn't.With the exception of Ever from Shin, all the deputy commanders were different from the previous ones. It was a good start.And quite swiftly, that afternoon, a carriage bearing the emblem of Count Gallon arrived in front of the Cavalry's barracks within the grounds of the Imperial Knight's quarters.As he watched the arrogant nobleman and the soldiers he brought with him enter, Yuder grinned ominously along with Gakane and the Eldore siblings.The nobleman who had tried to sell off the unawakened Kanna from the Cavalry without even conducting a proper ceremony ended up in a terrible state just an hour later, which caused a huge shock within the capital.The disgraced noble family, who had become a laughing stock, belatedly protested to Duke Peletta and the Emperor, but nobody listened to his complaint.Are they supposed to believe and punish based on just one person's words about an event they didn't witness themselves? According to the complainer, dozens of robust soldiers couldn't handle just four Cavalry members. It was the complainer who had first declared he would attack and kill. Wasn't this a case of self-defense? If the opponent was a Swordmaster, could they have acted the same?The written reprimand that the Emperor issued to the protesting nobleman served as an evaluation of the Cavalry members' skills that had been shrouded in mystery, and it was incessantly discussed among the people.The nobles, who hadn't even known the name of the Cavalry until then, felt an unpleasant fear creeping up their spines for the first time.The news spread rapidly beyond the capital to the empire, and eventually to the entire continent.Everything was going exactly as Kishiar La Orr and Yuder had anticipated.------\"Your Majesty. The Empress has come to visit.\"The Emperor sat at his desk, rubbing his weary eyes, the paper he'd been grappling with for some time finally set aside. Through his spectacles, his fatigue-laden eyes concealed, he didn't feel like the Emperor of the immense Orr Empire that had spanned a millennium.\"Let her in.\"The door promptly opened and a woman with pale blonde hair entered under the guide of the chief attendant. After surveying the room, littered with empty tea cups, papers, and books, she sighed heavily as if to signal her readiness to hear more, then approached the Emperor.\"Whilst I understand you can't leave this place, didn't I tell you to at least clean up more often?\"\"You're nagging the moment you arrive?\"Despite his words, the Emperor's expression was incredibly gentle. A faint smile, one he wouldn't even show his brother Duke Peletta, rose to his face. Seeing this, the Empress moved behind him. The sight of the Emperor's thin frame, visible through his shirt, hurt her inside.\"I worry for you. You look even more ill than before.\"\"My face is the same as always.\"\"No, it's not. You really do look unwell. Have you been drinking the herbal medicine I sent?\"The Emperor, feeling the Empress's slender fingers on his shoulder, smiled quietly. Even the times of excruciating pain that always ate away at his body, and the unbearable humiliation, felt like nothing in that moment.\"Of course. Why wouldn't I drink what you sent? I even had some just before.\"Only after she had confirmed when and how he had taken the medicine did the Empress let her worry subside a little.\"So, you really did take it all.\"\"When have I ever lied to you?\"\"Never. You've never lied... but....\"His grip tightened around the Empress's shoulder. The Emperor slowly raised his hand and held hers. The Empress's hand was soft and warm, but the Emperor's was rough like old bark and cold as a corpse.\"Sorry, did I startle you?\"However, before the Emperor's hand fully withdrew, the Empress's hand came down and held his tightly.\"I wasn't startled.\"The Emperor was a little surprised, then he laughed. The two held hands for a long time, receiving the sunset that poured through the window.After a while, as the Emperor's hand warmed from the heat transferred from the Empress's hand, the conversation resumed.\"By the way, did the Duke Peletta's visit go well? How was he?\"\"I'm still unsure.\"The Emperor responded in a soft voice.\"But he seemed more enthusiastic than I thought. I was a bit surprised when he volunteered to do the task we had planned to delegate to the mages. I wonder what got into him.\"\"Isn't that a good thing? Duke Peletta is undoubtedly worried about you as well.\"\"Well, he would be worried. The ordeal I'm going through will inevitably be his burden someday.\"\"There you go again, speaking so harshly on purpose.\"The Empress applied a slight pressure to the hand she had placed on the Emperor's shoulder. Despite being brothers, closer and more caring for each other than anyone else, the Emperor never openly displayed it.Considering the enemies scattered around them, it might have been inevitable, but the Empress felt a faint sadness whenever she saw the pessimistic attitude the Emperor displayed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58\"Did you not say there is a mysterious power in the Red Stone? I am certain that Duke Peletta will find a way to make it serve your cause.\"\"...\"\"The court mages and the priests of the Sun God are all working day and night for you, Your Majesty. And I too...\"The Empress trailed off, forcing a smile onto her face.\"Please continue to take the herbs I've prepared for you, replenish your energy, and you'll surely find a solution. Everything will be fine.\"Hmm. The Emperor swallowed the murmurs he couldn't bring himself to voice directly to his Empress.Even if he could mend what was already broken, how long would it last?------On an unusually sunny afternoon, three people stood in a deserted physical training field set up behind the Cavalry barracks. They were Yuder, Kanna, and Gakane.\"Before we start, how are you feeling?\"At Yuder's question, Kanna and Gakane closed their eyes, seemingly checking their own conditions.\"I'm... fine.\"\"Me too.\"\"Commander, do you not need to step back a bit?\"\"Ah, I'm also fine, of course. Don't worry about me and proceed.\"Kishiar, who had elegantly seated herself at a table a bit away from the trio, waved his hand with a languid smile.At the same time, Nathan, who had appeared from inside the barracks, placed a teacup from the tray he was carrying in front of Kishiar.As he poured tea from a teapot - too small in comparison to his hands - into the cup, a crisp and fragrant smell filled the dusty training field, seeming rather out of place.\"Such a wonderful aroma.\"\"It's tea made from the leaves of a medicinal herb the Empress has recently cultivated. She sent it while you were away on your mission.\"\"Her Majesty? Always in her debt. I suppose I'll have to write her a letter of thanks.\"While Kishiar's side was filled with serenity, the area surrounding Yuder was tense.Starting that day, Kanna and Gakane had decided to train under Yuder for the development of their abilities. Although it might seem odd to receive training from Yuder, who was essentially a fellow soldier even if he was the commander's assistant, the two of them had no objections, having seen his skills firsthand.Normally, many soldiers should have been in full swing training at that time. But now, there was no one except them. This was because the entire Cavalry had started a holiday that Kishiar had granted the day before.When all the nobles turned their eyes to the Cavalry after the incident of driving out Count Gallon, Kishiar seemed to have been waiting for the moment, announcing a week-long holiday.The official reason was to celebrate the successful completion of the Cavalry's first mission. But in reality, a select few knew that it was a maneuver to prevent the Red Stone hidden within the Cavalry from being exposed to unnecessary attention.The soldiers didn't know that the secret mission of their comrades, which had ended in success and a big reward, was to retrieve the Red Stone. However, they were extremely pleased to get a holiday thanks to it.There were quite a few people in the Cavalry, like Yuder, who were not confident of their admission and had left things to settle back in their hometowns.Including those who wanted to show their families what they would be like after being admitted, most of the soldiers left the barracks immediately.The vacation plan had initially begun due to a conversation with Yuder during the mission to recover the Red Stone, but Yuder himself had ultimately given up the vacation. He couldn't afford to spend a whole week of his scant month dedicated to locating the Red Stone on something like a holiday.There were also a few members, aside from Yuder, who didn't take the vacation. Most of them either had no place to return to, or their homes were too far to visit within a week. Among them was Kanna, of course.At first, Yuder had planned to take her alone for personal training to improve her abilities. After the holiday, he intended to strengthen all members' abilities even further, and had requested Kishiar for permission related to the training.However, the problem was that Gakane was present when Yuder approached Kanna to propose training together during the holiday.\"Training with Kanna? For a whole week? I want to join too. Let me do it.\"At first, Yuder refused. Training two people with different abilities could reduce his focus. However, Gakane was extremely persistent. He immediately canceled his plan to spend his vacation in his hometown and clung to Yuder.Since he had received permission from Kishiar to participate in the training plan, he would train the other members like Kanna in enhanced training after a week anyway. So he argued there was no need to do it first. But Gakane was adamant. His obsession with strength was beyond what Yuder had imagined.\"You're training with Kanna because the leader ordered you to investigate the Red Stone, right? You think her current abilities are insufficient, so you're trying to teach Kanna something more, aren't you? Then my shadow will definitely be helpful too!\"It was natural for him to think so, having seen Kishiar take back the Red Stone that they thought would be presented to the emperor. However, the one who ordered it was not Kishiar but Yuder himself, something Gakane naturally could not guess.Until then, Yuder had thought of Gakane as just a good-natured and diligent guy. But seeing his determination not to shy away from following him even to the restroom, Yuder's perception changed.Gakane Bolunwald was a persistent bugger who pretended to be nice.\"Yuder, please. I already know how tremendous your skills are. How could I give up such an opportunity? I want to become as strong as you. If I can train with you, I'll do whatever you say. I really mean it.\"\"...\"After being hassled all day, Yuder finally let out a long sigh.\"It's just one week. Nothing might change, and you may only suffer. Even so, are you willing to do as I say?\"\"Of course! If I gain nothing, that's my fault. I'll never blame you.\"The Yuder from his past life might have refused nonetheless. But Yuder eventually nodded. If the one eager to walk the path of hardship regretted it, so be it - it wouldn't be his loss.\"Alright.\"\"Thank you, Yuder!\"Gakane hugged Yuder tightly, his face filled with emotion.When Kanna heard that Gakane would be training with them, she was greatly relieved that she wouldn't be alone.To her, Yuder was a cherished comrade who was nothing less than a lifesaver, but he was sometimes even more inscrutable than Kishiar. The thought of training one-on-one with such a person for a whole week had made her secretly anxious.And so, two members became the first subjects of Yuder's ability enhancement training. Kishiar expressed great interest in this training plan and declared that he would definitely observe it.Thus, today's situation had been set in motion.The training ground they were to use was constructed in a place that could never be seen from the outside. Despite being right behind their lodgings, it was not visible from within, making it exceedingly suitable for a training session like today's.\"Yuder. But, can I... can I really do it? Even with training, can I actually develop my ability enough to read an object's information without touching it within a month...?\"Kanna asked with a worried expression. She was aware of the potency of Yuder's ability, but she was the one receiving the training. With the leader, Kishiar, watching over her, she felt afraid that she might disappoint them again, like the time when she was unable to help during the Red Stone retrieval mission.\"You can do it.\"Yuder answered with short but assured certainty, then pulled out an object he had brought earlier. Kanna and Gakane's gaze focused on it.\"A book...?\"\"What are you going to do with that?\"\"Kanna, try reading the information of this book using your ability first.\"Yuder purposely turned the back of the book to Kanna so she couldn't see the title. With a puzzled expression, Kanna approached and placed her hand on the book. Soon, a transparent energy began to ripple slightly between her fingers.\"Hmm... it's a book that has been handled by many people. Most of them seem to think it's a difficult book. It seems to be about 20 years old... a source of warm comfort...\"As Kanna spoke, her words gradually became less coherent and eventually faded. Yuder quietly observed her.\"I can't read any more than this. This is my limit.\"\"Kanna, when you use your ability, what do you usually think about?\"At Yuder's sudden question, Kanna's eyes widened in surprise.\"Huh? I just... I don't think about anything. Only about needing to read quickly...?\"\"I see. Then, this time, try using your ability while focusing on the thought that you must read information related to the title or content of this book. Can you do that?\"\"I've never tried before... but I'll give it a shot.\"Kanna took a deep breath and closed her eyes. Once again, she placed her hand on the book, and a short time later, a ripple, larger than before, began to emerge. Gakane, who was right next to her, seemed to notice this ripple as well, as he held his breath and looked surprised.\"...In the beginning, there was a land without light. One day, God took pity on those wandering in the darkness and cast down light. The first light was small and hard, clustered like a pebble... Remember the first sentence well, as it's the most important. The first of 14 chapters, in total 99 chapters...? This is...\"Slowly muttering, Kanna opened her eyes and looked down at the book with a stunned expression.\"This is the Scripture of the Sun God, isn't it?\"\"Yes, that's right.\"Yuder flipped the book over. It was indeed an old copy of the Scripture of the Sun God. Despite being quite worn from many hands over a long time, the cover still looked clean, as if it had been carefully preserved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYuder had borrowed it from one of the Cavalry members returning home the day before.He remembered that the man, a devout follower of the Sun God from a pious family, always carried multiple holy books. Believing Yuder to be a fellow devotee, the man had willingly lent him a copy.While not everyone deeply believed in the deity, most people on the continent had grown up closely observing and interacting with the temples of the Sun God from a young age.Therefore, even the commoners who could barely read were generally aware of the contents of the holy book. It was common knowledge. This was precisely why Yuder had chosen the holy book as his first training tool.\"Well, do you understand something now?\"\"Huh?\"\"Kanna, if you want, you can limit the scope of the information you read.\"At Yuder's words, Kanna's expression reflected a sudden realization.\"Oh... I see. I didn't know. I've never thought about it before...\"Of course, she hadn't. Until now, she was satisfied as long as she could read anything, and that had been enough.However, to develop abilities like hers, it wasn't sufficient to just read anything well.If one attempted to absorb excessive information without restraint, they would soon hit their limit. Her habit of abruptly stopping after reading a few words without order was likely due to using her ability aimlessly.\u201cSo, you must start by setting a goal and start from a narrow scope. First, practice reading the small things in detail, then gradually move on to more detailed and broader aspects. Eventually, you should be able to select and read the more critical information.\u201dIt was akin to practicing speed-reading. Initially, you would read each line thoroughly, and later, you would skim while still identifying the essential sentences.Of course, this wasn't a skill that could be mastered overnight. It would require consistent practice daily. It was something that would gradually prove its worth over time.\"Practicing with books would be best. At first, just touch the book and read only the information related to the content, then check how accurate you were. Once you're comfortable with that, move on to the author, when the book was written, and its previous owners. It might be easier to read if you start from the most recent person and go backwards.\"\"Ah...\"Kanna nodded frantically, trying her best to remember Yuder's words.\"Do I do this every day?\"\"Yes. And there's something else you need to do.\"Yuder pulled out a thin cloth from his pocket, wrapped half of the holy book, and placed it on the ground.\"Try to read the information of the book you just read in this state.\"\"...But I'll only be able to read the information of the cloth?\"\"Place half of your hand on the book and half on the cloth. Which one do you think you'll be able to read?\"\"Well...\"Kanna's expression changed peculiarly.\"I'm not sure.\"\"Try it. If the information of two objects tries to come in at once, try to read only the book's information. It's a practice of selecting information. Since it's the information of a book you've read once, you should be able to read it more easily.\"\"I... I'll try.\"As Yuder suggested, Kanna placed half of her hand on the cloth and the other half on the book, then closed her eyes again. The formless energy bursting from her hand was even larger and clearer during the second attempt, pulsating intensely.Kanna's forehead was drenched in sweat, a clear sign of her struggle. Her energy had fluctuated, growing and shrinking several times.\"Uh...\"\"Keep concentrating. Keep at it. Don't give up.\"\"My, my head hurts... I didn't know choosing to read would be this tough...\"It was to be expected. Growth, after all, often demanded pushing oneself to the limit just to advance a single step.However, the moment of using one's ability to its limit was often a moment of life-threatening danger. Therefore, many Awakeners only managed to grow within the brink of death.This faulty method of growth was something Yuder realized only quite late.'If you steer in the right direction and continuously stimulate your limit without endangering your life, you can still grow without facing such a crisis.'The important thing was to keep trying to exceed the limit of one's abilities, not to actually put oneself in danger.After watching Kanna struggle so diligently, Yuder turned his head. Gakane, who had been observing the two with his mouth slightly ajar, quickly straightened up in surprise.\"Gakane. You're next. Are you ready?\"\"Of course! Just tell me what to do!\"It was admirable to see a student brimming with so much enthusiasm. Even recalling his past life, Yuder could not remember a junior who sought to learn with such passion. Viewing Gakane with the heart of a former Cavalry commander, Yuder nodded in approval.\"First, bring out your shadow.\"Before he could even finish speaking, Gakane's shadow abruptly rose to its feet. The black silhouette had the exact height and build as its master.\"How far have you tested the limits of your shadow?\"\"Limit... I'm not sure. It just moves as I think...\"Gakane muttered as he looked at his shadow clone with unfamiliarity. He believed that by strengthening his own abilities, he could better control his shadow, thus he rarely used his powers and focused more on physical training and swordsmanship.That, of course, was a good method of training. But in Yuder's opinion, a pioneer who had repeatedly clashed and eventually reached the end in his field, such a method alone clearly had limitations.'Blindly training the body without knowing how far the shadow clone can exert its power is like a horse running with its eyes covered. It can run, but reaching the destination is difficult. It's a reckless approach.'From what Yuder had observed so far, his clone was capable of effortlessly lifting several long spears at once. This indicated that it could exert physical force, and that its strength was far superior to that of humans.And when it touched the Red Stone, the arm that exploded out was returned to shadow by Gakane, and when it was summoned again, it returned to its original form.If a shadow clone could recover from damage in such a way, shouldn't one naturally want to find out how far its limits went?\"Have you ever struggled while handling your shadow clone?\"\"Um... No. I don't think I ever did.\"Gakane shook his head as he recalled his memories.\"Good. Then let's test today how far you need to go before it becomes hard.\"Yuder casually drew the training sword he had at his waist. The training sword was blunt without any sharp parts, but that was sufficient.With a light gathering of force, red flames erupted from the sword in an instant. Overwhelmed by the intense heat and momentum, Gakane's expression hardened.\"From now on, I will attack your shadow clone. Do not move your main body, stand still, and use your clone to evade and block the attacks.\"\"What?\"\"Let's start.\"Without giving Gakane any time to think, Yuder lunged at the shadow clone. As he swung his flame-wielding sword, the clone staggered back to avoid the blow. But it was too late; one of its arms had already been severed.\"...\"Unlike humans, the shadow did not scream or show any signs of pain. The severed arm vanished as if it had never been there.\"Defend properly. If you can't move, revert to shadow form and resummon. We're starting from the beginning.\"\"Ah, got it. But I don't understand how I'm supposed to block a sword with a shadow......\"\"How is it possible for a shadow to carry multiple people? You've already been doing it all unconsciously, you just haven't realized it. Concentrate.\"\"\u2026ugh\u2026!\"\"Move your clone solely through will. Don't open your mouth to command it, and don't move your own body.\"Even as he issued these instructions, Yuder continued to swing his sword relentlessly. The shadow clone, slower than a human, could not properly evade even the casually swung sword.As Gakane's shadow clone continued to take damage and disintegrate, just before a final blow was about to strike its head, Gakane closed his eyes tightly and swallowed hard.At that moment, a miracle happened. The shadow clone raised its remaining arm in a flash, wrapping around its head to block the attack.It felt as if Yuder's sword had struck an invisible wall made of wind. A strange sensation traveled up his arm, and moments later, the blade was deflected.\"Wha...?\"Yuder nodded at Gakane's shocked expression, which said, \"I can't believe I just did that.\"\"Good. Let's continue.\"\"Wait! Give me a moment to think about how I just did that... Just a moment!\"There was no moment to be had. Yuder continued to batter Gakane's shadow mercilessly, ignoring Kanna's increasing frustration from the noise disrupting her concentration. Watching from the sidelines, Kishiar sipped his tea with a look of pure enjoyment.\"Look, Nathan. Isn't it amazing? It's as if a swordmaster is training a novice. I was curious about his teaching skills when he confidently asked for training authority, but the dreams of the squad members returning from vacation will be shattered. Hahaha.\"\"...It seems so.\"From a swordmaster's perspective, Yuder's swordsmanship was not particularly impressive. However, the powerful fire and water constantly emanating from his weapon, as well as his exceptional battle senses and judgment, could not be ignored.How much practice must he have had to be so adept at this strange combat style, being neither a mage nor a swordsman?Even if he had awakened quickly, it was only two years ago. Was it really possible to build such skills in that time frame?Ever since first meeting him, Nathan Zuckerman had been continually investigating Yuder Aile's background. But just as his lord had predicted, there was nothing to find. His past was impeccably clean.The only certainty was that, as an Awakener, he was a prodigy to a degree that would make anyone envious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"If he can fight so well simply by spewing fire and water from his sword, he would become a complete monster if he mastered any more techniques.\"\"Do you see it that way?\"Upon hearing Nathan's muttering, Kishiar softly retorted.\"Do you think differently, sir?\"\"In my eyes, I see a powerful beast trying to make itself small.\"Kishiar, after taking a sip of his tea, followed Yuder's movements without missing a beat, his red eyes unblinking.\"Liars can recognize other liars. For some reason, that captivating beast is intentionally hiding his strength.\"\"You're saying he's hiding his strength?\"Nathan was the type who would believe his lord even if he claimed the sun rose in the west, but this time, he couldn't help but question him.It was plain to see that Yuder Aile possessed exceptional skills, and he was an audacious man who had no intention of hiding his superior qualities. The idea that this man, who seemed least likely to hide anything in the world, was concealing even greater power within, was difficult to believe.\"He's hiding it. A lot of it.\"\"So he's indeed suspicious.\"\"But your investigation turned up nothing?\"\"...\"\"Nathan. It's time to trust your instincts over your suspicions. I've decided that he is essential to the Cavalry unit I plan to create. I don't know why, but that charming beast isn't sparing his body for me and the Cavalry unit. Isn't he boldly demonstrating his ability and teaching two people in an environment where he might be doubted? And doing both at the same time.\"Nathan nearly blurted out, \"What exactly is charming about him?\" but managed to swallow the words. A charming beast? Was he referring to the formidable man before their eyes? Even he would doubt his ears if he heard such a nickname.However, as Kishiar watched Yuder, his red eyes truly seemed filled with joy. He was always cheerful, but Nathan, having observed Kishiar for a long time, knew how to distinguish between his genuine and fake smiles. Surprisingly, his lord was sincerely smiling now.\"If it wasn't for him, I might have been seriously injured while retrieving the Red Stone this time. Or, using an unexpected amount of power might have put a crack in the balance I was barely maintaining.\"\"That's too speculative.\"\"Yes. But you also know that there's no guarantee that such things wouldn't have happened, right?\"Nathan remained silent, knowing that Kishiar's words were correct. His lord was always teetering on the edge.But in the past few years, it had become even more precarious, the line he was walking on seeming as thin as a thread.Kishiar, who seemed to have received all the blessings of heaven, became even more dangerous as these blessings accumulated. Neither friend nor foe left him alone. Such was his destiny.\"Regardless, it's true that he risked his life for me that day. If he was a spy sent by the dukes, he certainly wouldn't have left me in that situation.\"\"...\"\"I wonder where such a character came from. It's really interesting.\"\"Too much attention can be dangerous...\"Nathan had only managed to utter a single word, but Kishiar merely responded with a soft smile, not a verbal reply. His gaze remained steadfast on the man with black hair, who was ruthlessly swinging his sword, not moving in the slightest.\"Well... it might be a bit late to worry about that.\"His voice was so soft, even Nathan, the Swordmaster, couldn't properly hear him.Nathan refilled the seemingly delighted lord's empty teacup. As he did so, Kishiar's eyes slightly narrowed at the sight of a small, neatly folded note that had slipped underneath the teacup's saucer.\"What's this?\"\"While I was preparing the tea, a courier arrived from the Rik Mountains. You must have seen enough of the training, please take a look at this as well.\"Kishiar knew this was Nathan's attempt to distract him from watching Yuder, but he showed no sign of it and merely smiled. As he unfolded the note to read it, a few unrecognizable emotions flickered across his eyes.\"Place this inside my quarters' desk later.\"\"Yes.\"Kishiar handed the note back to Nathan after reading it. Nathan clutched it in his palm as if it were glued there, naturally hiding it from the view of others.Yuder, Gakane, and Kanna continued their vigorous training, paying them no mind. Kishiar, while watching them, opened his mouth without changing his expression.\"It seems that they've discovered a place near the base that appears to have been inhabited by beasts. However, no evidence to suggest who might be behind this has emerged.\"As this was expected, Nathan was not surprised.\"If they're that thorough, they won't give up just because of one failure.\"\"Indeed. The thought of those we didn't dare to touch over the last two years now flocking to us is already tiresome.\"\"Even so, didn't you bring the stone for His Majesty despite all this?\"Kishiar didn't respond to that. The conversation he had with the emperor when he went to the palace with the Red Stone he had retrieved a few days ago flowed through his mind.'Kishiar. So, is your vessel still fine?''Thanks to your concern, brother, it's perfectly fine.'When they were alone, Kishiar called the emperor 'brother'. Although this was against etiquette, when they were alone, the emperor called him by his real name, not his title, so it was all the same.'What a pity. If the late empress saw you alive and breathing healthily without any outburst, she would undoubtedly have been so upset that she would have risen from her grave. It's quite regrettable that I can't show her that her most important decision was so wrong.'The emperor's red eyes, visible through his glasses, shone with a cold, mocking smile. That mockery was directed not at Kishiar, but at the now-deceased empress. Guessing what era the emperor was recalling, Kishiar replied with a soft smile.'Well, it's all in the past anyway.''Yes, it's all in the past. Her forcing you into the position of duke, and the fact that because of that, I had to hand over the throne to my enemies in my court, it's all in the past.'The emperor's gaze, coldly muttering, turned to the box that Kishiar was holding. Kishiar was opening the box from a distance, as the emperor had expressed his wish to see the Red Stone.'That worthless little stone is really the Red Stone. Even as I see it, I can't believe it.'\"Everyone seems to say so.\"\"If that tiny thing truly possessed the power to protect your vessel two years ago, I hope it could be of some help to me this time around...\"A bitter smile crossed the Emperor's pale face.\"After all that curiosity, seeing it in person doesn't instill much faith. Perhaps it's best to let go of any expectations.\"\"Such discouraging words after I went through all the trouble to bring it, don't you think that's a bit much? Would I have bothered to fetch this if it weren't for you?\"The Red Stone undoubtedly held an incomprehensible, immense power. However, Kishiar never once desired or admired its power. The Emperor knew this all too well.\"You have quite the way with words. Is this why the benevolent man I know put me through so much hardship by forming a Cavalry?\"\"If the Cavalry hadn't been formed, we wouldn't have been able to retrieve the Red Stone safely, so it was a necessary step. Holding onto resentment for so long isn't good for your health.\"\"At this point, what's health to a man on his deathbed?\"All that was left was the slow tightening of the noose and the inevitable end. The Emperor's eyes told this tale.\"Oh dear. Where did the tyrant who hurried me every day to fetch the stone go? Did you really issue such an order just to torment your only brother? How disappointing. When did you stop believing in miracles....\"\"Enough. Stop talking.\"The Emperor waved his hand with a tired face. After telling Kishiar to close the box, he beckoned him closer.Kishiar placed the box at his feet and knelt in front of the Emperor. The Emperor stared at the face of his brother, a face both similar and dissimilar to his own.Bitterness, worry, relief, and countless other emotions surged in his eyes before receding, like sand washed away by the tide.\"Kishiar.\"\"Yes.\"\"I didn't order the quick retrieval simply because of a vain desire to expand my power. I believe you still have a chance, unlike me. If, after you and the mages have finished investigating and it turns out that the power of the stone truly helps the vessel, I will order you to use it first, even if it's just a moment sooner.\"\"Your wife would have been saddened to hear that.\"The Emperor's gaze softened momentarily at Kishiar's calm response to his astounding declaration. A profound longing was replaced by renewed determination.\"I'm not joking. Listen well. But if the opposite happens...\"The Emperor coughed a few times and muttered with a grave look.\"If it turns out that the stone's power is of no help to us, I'll leave the next steps to you. Whether you take it or destroy it, it's entirely up to you. However, it must never fall into the hands of the Dukes or the Crown Prince....\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I will dispose of it and pour a fresh cup.\"Kishiar, reflecting on the Emperor's last words, blinked and straightened his posture. As Nathan had pointed out, the tea in front of him had completely cooled.The training that had been ongoing before his eyes seemed to have taken a brief respite, as Yuder, Gakane, and Kanna were all sitting on the ground, engaged in a conversation.\"No, it's fine. I'll be leaving now.\"Kishiar rose from his seat, his gaze lingering on them. He had intentionally refrained from making any noise to avoid disrupting the training, so he didn't attract the attention of the three.\"Nathan, even in my absence, have a few pairs of eyes nearby so that we can know how the training progresses.\"\"Understood.\"Nathan bowed his head as he cleared away the teacups. As Kishiar prepared to return to his quarters, he turned as though a thought had suddenly occurred to him.\"...Ah. And if my assistant shows any signs of abnormality, no matter how slight, report it immediately without making any judgments.\"His gaze lingered on Yuder Aile's gloved hand, then vanished.------\"That's it for today. Starting from tomorrow, come out an hour earlier, run through the basic physical training course, and be prepared.\"\"...\"\"Answer.\"\"Yes...\"\"Understood\u2026\"Upon hearing Yuder's firm voice, Gakane and Kanna managed to respond, gasping for breath. They lay strewn about on the training ground with no sign of getting up.The moment Yuder turned to leave, Nathan, who had been watching from afar, gestured as if he had been waiting.\"The Duke has instructed you to go to his quarters once training is over.\"\"...Understood.\"Yuder had thought Nathan would accompany him, but Nathan had other tasks and disappeared somewhere. Thus, Yuder had to climb the stairs alone.Gakane and Kanna, looked at Yuder, still standing strong even after helping with the grueling training, as if he were a monster. But in reality, he was far from fine.His body, which had been subjected to harsh training until sunset, throbbed with each step, and he had a substantial headache along with a pit in his stomach where his mana hole was. It was because he had pushed his strength to its limit.'If it were the old days, I wouldn't have thought it to be this hard\u2026 Returning to the past has certainly changed my condition.'\"Commander, I'll go in now.\"Yuder knocked on the door at the top floor upon arrival and immediately entered. Kishiar, seated at his desk, studying something, glanced up at Yuder and smiled.\"You look quite tired.\"\"If it's not tiring, it's not training.\"\"True.\"Nodding, Kishiar rose from his seat. Lighting a magic stone casually, he walked around the warmth-radiating stove and sat in the guest chair.\"Come this way.\"Yuder slowly moved toward the chair opposite Kishiar, his gaze inadvertently drifting towards the stove.His sword was beautifully positioned on top of the stove as it had been today. Its unusual aura was the same as before, but Yuder suddenly felt that the sword was somehow different from before.'The energy... it's somehow different from before.'Today, the peculiar energy that had previously reached out so blatantly as if to guard against him was absent. He wasn't sure if it was just his mood, or a temporary situation, but Kishiar didn't make any comment, whether he noticed it or not.Yuder sat down and decided to silently wait for whatever Kishiar had to say to him.'He'll probably talk about today's training.'\"Would you take off your gloves?\"But, as always, Kishiar diverged from Yuder's expectations. Yuder maintained a silent pause for a moment, then his face hardened in surprise.\"Pardon?\"\"I'm talking about the gloves. The ones I gave you.\"Kishiar repeated his request more explicitly, thinking that Yuder hadn't fully understood him.\"Why the gloves, all of a sudden? Do I have to take them off?\"\"I want to check something. Or, did you perhaps find a reason that you can't take them off?\"What more could be said when the one who gave the gloves was asking such a thing? Yuder hesitated for a moment, but then slowly began to remove his left glove first, then tugged at the end of the right glove.However, when half of the back of his hand was revealed, his movement halted as if time had frozen.\"Just as I suspected,\" Kishiar said, sweeping his gaze over the back of Yuder's hand.\"Why didn't you mention this earlier?\"\"How did you know?\"Yuder looked down at the purplish speckles that nearly covered the back of his hand. He felt a strange sensation, like a child caught hiding something. The situation was indeed not very different.Yuder quickly hid his surprise and spoke as calmly as possible.\"I didn't think you had clairvoyant abilities.\"\"Of course, I don't. But, I thought now was the most appropriate time to check.\"After saying that, Kishiar lightly tugged at one side of the glove hanging from Yuder's fingertips and pulled it off completely.\"When you explained the circumstances of your previous injury, you mentioned that the speckles started out very small and grew this big after defeating those intruders. So, I thought the speckles might also grow when you use your ability... but you didn't have a chance to use your ability since then, right?\"Just as Kishiar said, there hadn't been a need to use his power since retrieving the Red Stone and visiting the palace.However, on the day Yuder drove out Count Gallon by force, he discovered that the speckles on the back of his hand had slightly grown after taking off his gloves at night.Thinking it might recover on its own, he left it alone, but seeing how it had changed after a whole day of training, the cause and effect became undeniably clear. It was just as Kishiar had guessed.\"Why didn't you report immediately after the incident with Count Gallon?\"\"At that time, the change wasn't clear perhaps because I hadn't used my power for a long time. There was also no pain, so I thought maybe... I'm sorry.\"Regardless of the reason, he had to apologize. As Yuder immediately bowed his head, Kishiar clicked his tongue lightly from above. It seemed as if he understood Yuder wasn't accustomed to reporting every personal issue.\"Do you still feel no pain? What if I press it like this?\"Before Yuder could react, Kishiar grabbed his hand and pressed his thumb on the speckles.\"...It feels normal.\"\"Any unusual sensation when you use your power?\"\"None.\"Yuder answered promptly, but Kishiar, as if not believing, probed several timesHe had answered obediently, but Kishiar didn't seem to believe him, pressing various spots on the back of his hand several times. It was only after confirming that there was no change in Yuder's expression that Kishiar showed signs of believing him somewhat.\"Alright. Let's try healing now.\"\"Are you sure? You said I should treat this power as if it doesn't exist.\"When Yuder asked cautiously, Kishiar chuckled.\"I did. But where will you go to heal this injury? To a temple? A wound that doesn't fully heal is often seen as a sign of a curse. Even if the priests don't think you're cursed, they might find it strange and report it to their superiors.\"\"...\"\"What do you think would happen then?\"Kishiar, who asked as if he was curious, slowly sprinkled a white light over Yuder's hand as he continued speaking.\"You'd be dragged off without a bird or a mouse knowing, to deep within the main mountain of the Temple of the Sun God. There, under the guise of a noble sacrifice for all humanity, you'd be put on the experiment table.\"\"...You're not lying? If such things happened, why hasn't there been any rumor?\"Yuder, combining his experiences from his previous life, knew more about the internal affairs of the temple and the priests than the average person. But he had never heard of such things as Kishiar described.When he questioned skeptically, Kishiar let out a light laugh.\"Isn't it obvious? The dead don't speak, hence no rumors.\"With a single sentence, the noble main mountain of the Temple of the Sun God transformed into a terrifying group that wouldn't hesitate to commit murder. Considering the speaker was a member of the imperial family who wielded the power of the Sun God, there was no greater blasphemy.\"I heard that priests who blaspheme against the God lose their divine power, but it seems that's not true.\"\"I'm not a priest.\"\"...\"Something was strange, but he couldn't argue against the truth. After a few more such absurd exchanges that left Yuder speechless, Kishiar gathered the white light and slowly pulled his hand away.\"Indeed, it's better now.\"However, it was not entirely healed. The spot that had covered Yuder's hand was reduced to about the size it was when he first got injured.\"...Thank you.\"\"If you appreciate it, come straight to me when there's a change next time.\"That seemed to mean he would have to receive this type of treatment from Kishiar every time he used his power.Was it really necessary to go that far when there was no pain and it just got a bit bigger? Now he knew for sure when the spot changed and that it got better when he received treatment.After hesitating for a moment, Yuder spoke.\"Do I... have to do that? There's no pain, so it seems alright to just leave it alone for a while and see what changes occur.\"\"That's reckless. What if that spot spreads and reaches your heart or vital organs, and turns out to be a type of curse that kills instantly? You only have one life, and I only have one assistant, so take the treatment when I offer it.\"\"But if we have to do this every time...\"Divine power was a force that was wielded at the expense of the user's vitality. Thankfully, Kishiar's complexion was still healthy, but Yuder felt a great burden as if he was accumulating a debt to him.If he had to think about holding hands with him and getting treated every time, he wouldn't be able to use his power properly in critical moments.As Yuder swallowed his words and trailed off, Kishiar smiled gently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If we can understand the power held by the Red Stone, we might find the answer. If you feel burdened, well, then, take this.\"Suddenly, Kishiar, who had stood up from his place, went over to the stove. Yuder wondered what he was doing, and to his surprise, he detached one of the decorative gems embedded in the sheath of his divine sword and came back. It was a slender, rhombus-shaped red gem.\"With divine power filled in it, carrying it should considerably slow down the progression.\"\"I'm not sure if I can accept such a valuable thing...\"\"If you don't accept it, I'll have to come up and hold your hand every day, won't I? Ah, maybe that's what you hoped for?\"\"Thank you for your consideration.\"Yuder did not refuse a second time and quickly accepted it with a bow. Kishiar laughed.\"I'll overlook it until the range of that mark goes beyond your elbow. It should be fine up to that point. But not any further.\"His words were extremely affectionate yet firm. After all, wasn't his intention to train the members to find out about the Red Stone?In the history of the empire, Kishiar might have been the only imperial family member to treat a subordinate of humble origin with such care. However, Yuder didn't find it pleasant.Yuder\u2019s return changed many aspects of Kishiar. However, some aspects remained the same.In his previous life, even after the unpleasant incident involving Yuder, Kishiar had always been kind to him, and although he had built walls, he had treated him more than fairly. One couldn't deny that he was a very peculiar character, but he was never a bad person.But how did it all end up?'I need to figure out everything I can before my vacation ends.'If he wanted to avoid getting entangled with Kishiar and protect his life, he needed to understand him better than in his previous life. There was still too much he didn't know.------For the next five days, except for meal times and sleep, Yuder trained Kanna and Gakane without a moment's rest.Even the spectators were exhausted, but Yuder never showed any signs of fatigue. So, naturally, Kanna and Gakane could not show their tiredness either.The two realized that all the training they had received in the Cavalry was nothing compared to Yuder's training. As they got a bit comfortable, he increased the difficulty, and as soon as they got used to that, he immediately noticed and tried even harder training.It was astonishing how well he could come up with such brutal training methods.\"That's it for today. Let's take a day off tomorrow.\"And finally, on the sixth day, Yuder quietly declared the end of the training with a face no different from when he started. Kanna and Gakane simultaneously collapsed on the training ground floor.\"Ah... I guess this is what feeling like death feels like...\"\"Gakane, it's not feeling like death for me, I'm already dead.\"Despite their words, the expressions of the two lying down were significantly brighter. It was because they had achieved clear results during the hellish six days.Gakane had come to understand the limits of his shadow clone, and the movement, attack power, and defense power of the clone had grown so much that it couldn't be compared to before. It was thanks to being ripped and rolled thousands of times under Yuder's sword.Kanna too had succeeded in selectively reading only the information of the book, not the heavens, from a book that spanned the sky. Thereupon, Yuder trained her in a similar fashion to place both hands simultaneously on two objects and read only the information from one, and when that was successful, he began to drop the objects very slightly from her fingertips.At first, she thought it was impossible to read an object from a distance, but it wasn't. Kanna learned the astonishing fact that as long as an object merely touched the swirling energy flowing from her hands, she could read its information without touching it.Of course, the distance was only about the length of a fingernail for now and the success rate was very low, but she would gradually increase it.\"Yuder, we're training with the other classmates starting the day after tomorrow, right?\"\"Yes.\"\"Haha. I'm looking forward to it. Really.\"Gakane laughed cheerfully with a face caked in dust. Yuder wondered if Gakane had become a little strange due to the excessive training over the past six days.'As long as we continue like this, there won't be any sudden deaths wherever we go.'Gakane's death had not yet come, but the situation was constantly changing, and they didn't know what would happen next.However, if Gakane didn't lose his strong desire to become stronger and continued to train, he could achieve a rate of growth that couldn't be compared to the past.\"But Yuder. We're taking a break tomorrow, right? Do you have something to do? If not, with me...\"\"Huh? I thought I heard a noise in the training ground, and here everyone is?\"As Gakane was about to say something to the absorbed Yuder, someone popped their face out from the dormitory. It was Ever, who had gone back to her hometown for vacation.\"Ever! You're back now?\"\"Kanna. I came back early after seeing my family. But......\"As Kanna stood up with a half-smile, Ever began to approach with a smile but stopped short.\"Why do you all look like that? Covered in dust.\"\"Oh, yes. Hahaha. We three didn't take a vacation, right? We had nothing to do, so we did some independent training and ended up like this.\"\"But what kind of training did you do to......\"Kanna stuttered as she glanced at Yuder's expression. It wasn't time to let the other members know why they had been training so hard. Fortunately, Ever didn't suspect much.\"Training is good, but do it moderately. But if you've been here the whole time... Do you know when those strange people outside arrived?\"Ever's last question was directed at Yuder. After a moment of thought, Yuder opened his mouth.\"Strange people, what do you mean?\"\"Oh. Didn't you see? I saw a suspicious duo on my way back to the dormitory. They were going around the Imperial Knight's grounds, grabbing anyone and asking about the Cavalry, so I avoided them.\"\"A duo?\"\"How could such people enter here?\"Kanna and Gakane asked, their faces full of incomprehension. Yuder, hearing the word \"duo\", pondered for a moment before throwing a question at Ever.\"Did you happen to get a good look at their appearances?\"\"One was an old man. He had a very long beard. And the other was young, but they didn't look like a grandfather and grandson.\"The look in Yuder's eyes changed instantly. He seemed to know who they were. It was Thais Yulman, the elder mage of the Pearl Tower, whom he had met in the imperial palace, and his apprentice. As if recalling the same memory, Kanna turned her surprised face toward Yuder.\"Yuder. Could they be the ones we saw at the imperial palace...? Did the Count send people again?\"\"It has nothing to do with the Count.\"Yuder answered succinctly, shaking his head.\"But the people we saw, they must be the ones. They said they're looking for the Cavalry. We should go meet them.\"\"In that state?\"Ever asked incredulously. Yuder glanced down at his uniform, which was more dirty than its original black, and nodded.\"Yes.\"\"Yuder. I want to go with you.\"\"Me too.\"Upon hearing this, Kanna and Gakane immediately rose to their feet and volunteered to follow. Every time they moved, dust billowed up, causing Ever to crinkle her nose.\"Nobody will believe the three of you are from the Cavalry in that state. I'll come too.\"------The Cavalry's quarters were situated in the most remote corner of the Imperial Knight's compound. The Knights, proud of their Imperial Knight's ground, treated the intruding Cavalry as an eyesore, practically ignoring them as if they didn't exist.It was easy to enter the compound of the Imperial Knights, but no one among the wandering Knights reacted to the name of the Cavalry. Therefore, anyone visiting the Cavalry for the first time could never find their destination.Respected elder Thais Yulman of the Pearl Tower and his apprentice, Alik Pelgin, were also struggling, wandering around the vast compound since morning.\"Master. Wouldn't it have been better to send a formal letter to Duke Peletta expressing our wish to visit first? If we continue like this, we'll spend the whole day wandering around.\"\"You imbecile. Make sense. Do you think if I said I wanted to go there, the Duke of Peletta would welcome me warmly? If the Red Stone is in their hands, they wouldn't accept any outside visitors, especially us from the Pearl Tower! So it's best to go and try our luck!\"\"But first, we need to find them to take a shot, don't we? Moreover, we're not even sure if the stone is really there.\"\"We've already confirmed it's not in the palace. There's nothing more certain than the information leaked by the Duke of Diarca. They purposely leaked it to me, so we have nothing to lose. Stop complaining and move forward.\"Alik felt extremely aggrieved. Their purpose wasn't suspicious at all, so what was wrong with contacting them beforehand?He had long gotten used to his master's eccentricities, but it was heartbreaking to see himself suffer like this.\"There are a few more Knights over there. Go ask them.\"Just then, a few Knights with flashy swords appeared before their eyes. The Knight in the lead, who was guiding two young men, was particularly arrogant and sharp-looking, undoubtedly from a noble family.Alik, pushed by his master, timidly approached them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Alik quickly scanned the blue uniform of the leading knight, noticing the golden eagle emblem and three lilies engraved on it.\"I heard that somewhere around here, the Cav... no, the Duke of Peletta... is staying. I got lost while trying to find him. Could you kindly help me?\"Alik swiftly changed his words as he caught sight of the knight's expression twisting at the beginning of the word 'Cav'.Every Imperial Knight they had encountered so far disappeared as soon as they heard the word 'Cav', but this was the first time one had become outright hostile.\"The Duke of Peletta? For what reason do you seek him?\"\"I'm sorry, but I can't disclose that.\"How could he tell them that he was a mage from the Pearl Tower, who had heard about the Red Stone and came to conduct some research? Moreover, he wasn't even an invited guest.As Alik awkwardly smiled and shook his head, the knight studied him and Thais standing behind him, lost in thought. His deep, black eyes, shining arrogantly, turned fierce after a moment.\"Take these men and lock them up.\"\"Pardon?\"Alik couldn't believe his ears. Yet, the Knight's orders continued unabated.\"Considering they're hiding their purpose of visit, there's no doubt they're suspicious. They must be connected to those vile insects. We need to find out what they're planning. Arrest them immediately!\"The Knights behind him bowed their heads in response and rushed to seize Alik and Thais. Alik had been through a lot while serving his research-obsessed master, but being arrested by knights and facing the risk of imprisonment was a first.\"Wait, sir knight! We're not suspicious! We even have proper passes! If you check them, you'll see!\"\"Such things can be easily forged.\"\"Then we can go to the imperial palace...! We have everything there to verify our identities!\"\"The imperial palace? You expect me to believe that now?\"The knight smirked, looking them over in their shabby attire.Today, Alik and Thais had dressed as commoners to maintain their anonymity. Therefore, they had left their pearl badges, which signified their membership in the Pearl Tower, at the Palace Mages' Tower.If they had known this would happen, they would have definitely carried their badges! Alik heaved a deep sigh, but it was too late.'Master, this is all your fault. You need to say something!'As Alik internally fumed and turned his gaze towards his master, Thais, who had been quietly observing the knights holding his arms, finally spoke.\"Young knight, may I know your name?\"\"I have no name to tell suspicious people.\"\"We merely asked for help because we were lost. Do you think it's right to arrest us without any evidence, circumstantial proof, or even verifying our names, simply based on speculation and emotion? Is this what the Imperial Knights, the pride of the Orr Empire, stand for?\"Thais had held the position of a senior member at the Pearl Tower for over 20 years, and it wasn't without reason. His voice was filled with a dignity and gravity that couldn't be easily dismissed.It seemed the knights considered him an unusual man, as they exchanged glances, but the knight who stood at the forefront, bearing three lilies, merely snorted at his words.\"How dare you disparage the Imperial Knights with your foul tongue. I will not fall for such a ruse!\"\"Sir Kiolle, even so, shouldn't we at least verify his identity before making such accusations? Or perhaps we could contact Duke Peletta...\"The knight beside him grumbled with an uncomfortable expression, but the one called Kiolle flared up at his words.\"Yelsin! Are you on his side too?\"\"N-no, I'm not.\"\"Then keep your mouth shut and follow my orders!\"He had dealt with countless arrogant nobles, but Kiolle was different. Alik decided to never forget the name of this detestable man. Despite serving under his master as if he were a servant, Alik was a talented mage from a noble family with a surname.The position of the elder's direct disciple was not obtained for no reason. Being looked down upon in this way for the first time, despite being expected by his peers to succeed his master and be the future of the tower, was a new experience for him.'If our master, who became an elder through elemental magic, were here, he would've let out a blast of magic and put an end to this.'However, Thais was a master of magic research, not offensive magic. Alik decided to give up any further confrontation, thinking he would have to call someone who could verify their identities once he was taken into custody.That's when it happened.\"It seems those are the ones we're sure of.\"\"I told you so.\"From afar, the sound of noisy voices reached them, and four figures appeared.\"It has to be them. I saw them being ignored when they asked where the Cavalry was earlier. I'm sure.\"They were all wearing the same black uniform. But three of the four were so covered in dirt and dust that had it not been for the one clean-dressed among them, one would not have recognized they were in the same uniform.Alik was staring blankly at their faces when he suddenly recognized one. A pale man with black hair. Trying hard to remember where he'd seen him before, he suddenly recalled.'Right. The one who was fighting the noble in the palace! He definitely said he was from the Cavalry!'Alik did not remember Kanna, who had been behind Yuder with her hood deeply drawn. However, even though he had only seen Yuder briefly, he had left a lasting impression in his memory.\"Excuse me, knights.\"As soon as the Cavalry appeared, the gaze of the Imperial Knights sharpened. They menacingly placed their hands on their sword hilts, ready to draw at any moment. Among them, Kiolle's face was flushed with anger, as if he were about to explode at any moment.\"Filthy scoundrels. You have a lot of nerve showing up here.\"\"Cavalry members have the right to freely roam the grounds of the Imperial Knights. I'm not sure what you're talking about.\"The black-haired man slightly tilted his head with an expressionless face. There seemed to be no intent in his factual statement, but it was enough to further irritate Kiolle.\"We heard that the two of them came looking for our Cavalry, so we came to find them. May I ask why you are detaining them?\"Alik was moved by the fact that someone had finally come to his rescue. However, Kiolle was quite the opposite.\"Shut your nonsense! You came here knowing I was present! Fine. Now that I've finally seen with my own eyes that you weren't expelled, let's settle this!\"Kiolle roared, but the man remained unruffled. He simply blinked his eyes slowly, as if looking at a stranger.\"Um... I apologize, but when have we met? I can't seem to remember who you are.\"\"...What?\"Could there possibly be a more humiliating and insulting situation?Alik thought for a moment that Kiolle's face might explode. The other knights seemed to share the same sentiment, as they all held their breaths and glanced towards Kiolle.However, seeing the strange expressions on the faces of the man's companions standing around him, it appeared that Kiolle and the man truly did not know each other.\"You... are saying... you can't remember me?\"Kiolle stammered, seeming unaware of his own stuttering.\"Was there something memorable? I don't think there was... Gakane, do you remember?\"The red-haired man referred to as Gakane gave Kiolle and the man a sidelong glance and awkwardly smiled.\"Uh... Yuder. You really don't remember? That... time when you, uh... did that thing to his sword. And he fell over... And the Commander even came and said something...\"\"...Oh. That time. I remember now.\"A flicker of light finally returned to the man's eyes, which had been dim until he heard the word \"Commander.\" In contrast, Kiolle's face paled even more, consumed by extreme anger.\"How dare you insult me in such a way and hope to live? Fine. Draw your sword! I challenge you to a duel!\"\"I'm not a knight, so I'm not obliged to accept a duel. Also, this sword is... just a blunt practice sword made of iron.\"The man named Yuder calmly drew his sword slightly from its scabbard. As he had said, it was a worn and old practice sword without an edge.Thanks to that, Kiolle ended up looking like a fool for recklessly challenging someone wielding a practice sword to a duel without even recognizing his opponent. The knights standing behind him couldn't bear to look at Kiolle anymore.But the people standing behind Yuder had no need to hold back their laughter, and they openly shook with laughter. Alik felt regret that he couldn't join them in their mirth.'What an impressive man. To reduce his opponent to a fool with such calm demeanor.'\"That's right. It's a waste to use a sword to punish mere insects!\"In the end, Kiolle lost his reason. Instead of a sword, he swung his hand to slap Yuder across the face.\"Yuder!\"Yuder's companions hurried to intervene. However, Alik felt a sudden strange wind gusting around Yuder at that moment.\"Uh... oh...!\"Kiolle's body twisted in the wind. He missed his target and swung his arm into thin air. Unable to resist the recoil, he tumbled forward, landing face-first onto the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My goodness. The last time I saw something this ridiculous was eight years ago, when some fool vowed to create a spell that would force a monster to dance until it died of exhaustion!\"Shortly thereafter, as if caught up in his laughter, Yuder's comrades also began to chuckle, one by one.\"Hahaha... hahahahaha!\"Amidst the sea of laughter, Kiolle's fellow knights hurriedly helped him to his feet. Kiolle had fainted, his head hanging low.They disappeared without a word, as if marching away in formation. It was a humorous sight, hardly befitting the reputedly most beautiful and honorable knights of the continent - the Imperial Knights of the Orr Empire.\"Yuder, how on earth did you do it? We thought you could only use fire and water!\"\"Think of it as my own progress, just as you've progressed.\"\"Is it something to talk about so easily, having one more element you can use?\"Amid the unending laughter, Yuder, conversing calmly with the redhead, turned his gaze toward Alik. Alik, feeling as if his thoughts were being pierced by those eyes, nervously stammered.\"Hello. Do you, uh, remember us? You only met my master, to be precise......\"\"Yes. I remember.\"Luckily, Yuder replied coolly.\"I heard you were looking for the Cavalry. You don't seem to be invited guests, so may I ask what your business is?\"\"Ah, that's......\"Alik cast a resentful look at his master, who was still laughing heartily. It was about time for him to step in. But the master showed no signs of doing so.\"My master has something very important to say to Duke Peletta, which is why we came suddenly. But the road... uh, it was harder than we thought. Haha......\"\"Yes. It is difficult.\"A faint, cool smile flashed across Yuder's lips and then disappeared. He had noticed Alik cursing the knights who had ignored their request for help.\"Follow me. I'll guide you.\"Alik was quite surprised, as he had thought Yuder wouldn't be so compliant in offering help. But Yuder had already turned and was striding ahead.\"Master, that man said he would guide us. Shall we go?\"Alik grabbed the arm of his master, who was laughing so hard that tears were starting to form, and followed behind him.\"Alik. That guy, he's not an ordinary one.\"Thais murmured low enough for only his disciple to hear as they neared the Cavalry barracks.\"I came to see the stone, but it seems I have one more subject to study.\"\"So, they're downstairs now?\"\"Yes.\"After leading the mages from the Pearl Tower to the guest lounge on the first floor of the Cavalry barracks, Yuder went straight up to meet Kishiar alone. Gakein had wanted to accompany him, fearing that Kishiar might be angry, but there was no need. Kishiar was far from angry; instead, he seemed very interested in the situation Yuder had created and resolved.\"Good. I know you wouldn't act thoughtlessly. Meeting Kiolle Diarca again is nothing but bad luck... Anyway, now that the situation has been explained, let's move on to the next step.\"Yuder looked at Kishiar, who leaned back comfortably in his chair with a leisurely smile, carefully choosing his words.\"They did not clearly state so, but to my eyes, they are mages. Probably from the Pearl Tower. For such people to visit here, uninvited at this time, and only stating they need to see the Commander without making their purpose clear. They must have come for the Red Stone.\"The old man with a long beard who casually mentioned magic. The disciple who respectfully called such an old man his master - they perfectly embodied the tradition of one-on-one mentorship typical of mages. If they were court mages, there would be no need to hide their identities, so the only remaining possibility was clear.Of course, Yuder knew who they were immediately due to his memories from his past life, but he did not tell Kishiar that.\"If that's your interpretation, then so be it. So what?\" Kishiar's eyes softened as he rested his chin on the hand propped on his armrest.\"How should I deal with the mages who have come for the Red Stone?\"\"I think you need to figure out how they knew the stone was here and what they want to do with it. After all, you need to understand their intentions before you can use them.\"\"Use them...\"\"Even if they came here because of the Tower's will, in the end, they are mages. 'Even if the tower crumbles tomorrow due to the magic cast today'...\"\"'If you want to cast, cast it and face death.'... That's a maxim inscribed at the top of the Pearl Tower.\"That saying was known to have been left by a mage who dedicated his entire life to the magic of moving objects and ultimately tried to pull the moon to the earth hundreds of years ago. His magic failed, but his words remained, etched as a motto that symbolizes the spirit of the entire Pearl Tower.\"So, are you suggesting that we should try to persuade them by appealing to the mages' greed?\"He didn't say it directly, but Kishiar immediately understood Yuder's meaning.Mages of the Pearl Tower were famous for their fanatical obsession with the magic they were practicing. They didn't hesitate to engage in all sorts of unethical behaviors for the perfection of magic.If Thais Yulman had no particular interest in the Red Stone and was forced to come here due to the will of the Tower, he wouldn't have bothered to leave the palace and even seek out the Cavalry. But he came here in his shabby clothes and endured insults from the Imperial Knights without revealing his identity. Considering his major was researching such things, it could have yielded a good result.\"They did not seem like bad people. I plan to investigate the Red Stone with the help of a few members, including Kanna, but wouldn't it be better to have more help?\"\"Originally, the court mages were going to investigate the stone first. Why should I persuade a mage from the Pearl Tower instead of them?\"\"If you trusted them, wouldn't you have already entrusted the stone to the court mages, regardless of what I said?\"Yuder calmly spoke the most reasonable answer. Satisfaction spread across Kishiar's face.\"Indeed, my assistant is smart. It's fortunate that not everyone is as quick-witted as you.\"Yuder had seen in his previous life how sensitive the court mages were to power. It was only natural since those who wanted to gain power rather than improving their magic skills often became court mages.On the surface, they professed loyalty to the emperor alone, but behind the scenes, they colluded with various nobles and engaged in dirty dealings.What the current emperor was thinking, one couldn't be sure, but Kishiar certainly couldn't trust them fully. Considering the risk of information leaking, it was much safer to win over a single archmage obsessed with magic research rather than entrust the palace mages. This likely played a part in his easy acceptance of Yuder's suggestion.\"Fine. Let's go down then. Let's see what kind of talent the Pearl Tower has sent us.\"Kishiar rose from his seat. Yuder thought he would head straight out of the quarters, but surprisingly, he approached Yuder and peered closely at his face.\"...Commander?\"Yuder instinctively tensed and cautiously questioned.\"You seem to have had no time to wash your face after training. You're a mess.\"He took out a handkerchief and wiped Yuder's cheeks and forehead. The fragrance emanating from the handkerchief made his back stiffen for a moment.Yuder recognized Kishiar's slightly sharp body scent. It had been a faded memory in his mind for a long time. The sudden reality of the scent unsettled him.\"Please... stop.\"\"We're almost done anyway.\"He turned his face to evade, but it was in vain. Kishiar, who followed him till the end and wiped up to his nose, put the handkerchief back in his pocket. His nonchalant behavior left Yuder speechless.\"You could just tell me to wash up. Why do this?\"\"What's wrong with being kind?\"\"Why are you putting the handkerchief back? It's dirty, you should leave it.\"\"Don't be so sensitive. I'm fine.\"Kishiar laughed merrily and patted Yuder's shoulder. If anyone should act sensitively, it should be the noble Kishiar, not the commoner Yuder. Yuder deeply regretted not washing his face earlier.\u2014---\"You must have had a long journey. Thank you for coming.\"Kishiar, who had descended to where the mages were with Yuder, cheerfully greeted first.\"Are you His Excellency, Duke Peletta?\"\"Yes, indeed. However, here, my position as the commander of the Cavalry takes precedence, so please call me that.\"Finally seeing Duke Peletta in person, Alik was stunned once by his beauty, as if witnessing the incarnation of the Sun God, and twice by his seemingly snaky smile.'I heard he was a spendthrift, unintelligent, and impulsive, but what's with these rumors?'Casually glancing to the side, he noticed no change in Thais's expression.'Master is something. If you knew the rumors were wrong, you could have told me earlier!'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhile Alik grumbled internally, Kishiar invited the old mage and his apprentice to take a seat. Yuder stood behind Kishiar, an assistant in his stead. Although Yuder's face was cleaner than before, his attire was still unkempt, yet Kishiar seemed unconcerned with his subordinate's appearance.Did this signify the grandeur of the Duke, or was it a silent warning to Thais and Alik, stating that they didn't even need to show the slightest courtesy? Alik's mind raced.It was Thais who spoke first.\u201cI am grateful, sir, that you personally greet an old man who came uninvited. I am Thais Yulman, a mage from the Pearl Tower. This is my unruly apprentice, Alik Pelgin.\u201d\u201cI am Alik Pelgin, a mage from the Pearl Tower.\u201dAfter acknowledging the greetings of the two mages, Kishiar gracefully raised his hand towards Yuder.\u201cThis is Yuder Aile, my assistant. I've heard that my assistant had an encounter with both of you at the palace previously. Seeing as we meet again today, it seems like there must be a deep connection.\u201dIn reality, Kishiar had been secretly observing while in disguise, but the two mages didn't know that.\u201cIndeed, sir. If it weren't for Sir Aile, I wouldn't have been able to make it here today. I didn't have the opportunity to express my gratitude earlier. Thank you, Sir Aile.\u201d\u201cI just did what I had to.\u201dAlik was quite surprised by the identity of Yuder, something he couldn't have guessed just by appearances. A young man held a position usually occupied by those with much more experience, and he'd already received a last name. There was indeed justification for his confidence, even in front of nobles.\u2018Well, considering he knocked out that Knight named Kiolle at once, he's no ordinary skilled person. It's rare to see someone not from the Pearl Tower who can use attribute magic so quickly and simply. Are there many people of that level of skill here? Or is Yuder Aile extraordinary?\u2019Alik examined Yuder's pale face. The inscrutable cold expression and shadow-draped eyes were a bit intimidating, but considering he'd helped save him and his master, Alik felt a sense of goodwill.\u201cThais Yulman. I've heard your name before. You are a renowned elder within the Pearl Tower, currently focused on research. May I ask why you've come here, concealing your name and identity?\u201d\u201cIf you know me, haven't you already guessed my purpose?\u201dThais stroked his long beard with a calm smile.\u201cI heard that you managed to acquire something that no one else could for the past two years. As a researcher of magic, how could I resist coming when I heard the news? I am here to see it.\u201d\u201cSo such rumors have spread. Don't you think they are rather exaggerated? I wonder who could have spread such a story all the way to the Pearl Tower.\u201d\u201cDoes it matter what it is? The fame of you and the Cavalry has spread throughout the continent. Naturally, everyone will find out. Isn't there a saying that a tongue is the hardest weapon to control in the world?\u201dThais Yulman's rhetoric was very cunning. While he didn't hide his eagerness to investigate the Red Stone, he brushed off the issue of how he got the information as if it wasn't important.A trace of chilliness spread over Kishiard's smiling face, as if he had noticed something.\"His Majesty the Emperor values sincerity above all else when he embarks on a significant task. I do not think it was such a good choice to come here, escaping his sight.\"\"Commander, isn't it true that, even if everything else was exaggerated, the Red Stone indeed disappeared from its original place? At first, I intended to meet His Majesty the Emperor. However, when I found out that he has long stopped seeing even the envoys from foreign nations, I thought it better to grasp at straws than to wait aimlessly. Wouldn't anyone think the same?\"As Kishiar remained silent at his words, Thais seemed to gain strength and continued speaking honestly.\"I do not mean to boast, but I have devoted myself single-mindedly and earned the title of an elder. No one on this continent can investigate the Red Stone as thoroughly as I can. All this old man desires is the chance to see it even once and research what is hidden inside it. Please do not doubt this. Who sent me here is not important to me. If necessary, I will even write a vow.\"\"...\"\"Commander, isn't it true that you also need someone to thoroughly investigate the stone? Isn't that why we are face-to-face like this?\"'He had confidence from the beginning.'Yuder quietly speculated as he watched Thais.'Thais Yulman must have known that the Emperor and Kishiar wouldn't completely trust the court mages, so he came running. He believed that someone would eventually need to investigate, and that his skills were the best, so he came with such confidence.'If the Emperor and Kishiar really wanted to possess the stone, the best course of action would be to accept Thais's proposal. The old mage offered quite a tempting proposal: he would overlook everything else if only they entrusted him with the research. Now, it was time to see how Kishiar would respond.\"Well, in fact, His Majesty the Emperor once said that it would be better to destroy the stone right away rather than letting the peace of the entire continent shake due to it. And as we all know, we don't necessarily need to investigate in order to destroy.\"\"Are you saying... it was retrieved for destruction?\"Thais's expression subtly changed for a moment.\"Haha. I didn't say for sure whether it has been retrieved or not. But if needed, it could be so.\"Various thoughts seemed to flicker in the old magician's head.Was Kishiar's certainty a sign that the Emperor's side had already completed some investigation of the stone? Did they conclude that the power within the stone was, in fact, trivial? Or was this merely to shake Thais Yulman?Thais Yulman scrutinized Kishiar's face meticulously. He could not read any real intentions from his languid smile. However, when he spoke of destruction if necessary, it felt undeniably sincere.'The Empire wouldn't want change... They'd probably think it better to destroy it unless they deem it a power worth risking. It's a plausible story.'But even if the stone held no particular power, Thais Yulman desired to see it. The Pearl Tower had ordered him to bring the stone, but Thais wanted to monopolize this golden research opportunity, if possible.Thinking that his opponent would be the one regretting, he had mustered up courage, but now it seemed he was the one feeling regretful.Thais Yulman hesitated, then opened his mouth.\"The House of the Four Dukes... I believe they might have a better solution than destruction.\"It was a veiled hint. It implied that among the four ducal houses, someone had leaked information about the Red Stone to the Pearl Tower and Thais Yulman.'Or perhaps, it was all of them.'While Yuder finally watched Thais Yulman play his cards, Kishiar lightly tapped his crossed knee with his finger.\"A better solution, huh? Do you think so too?\"It was a short question, as if asking him to choose between the emperor and the four ducal houses. However, Yulman grasped another implication within it.A smile spread across his face after a moment.\"Oh dear. I am merely an old mage. Did I not tell you I have no interest in such important matters?\"Kishiar's tapping finger halted on his knee.\"That's a pity. I hoped to benefit from the wisdom of a wise elder.\"After saying this, he turned to Yuder and gave him a slightly different smile than before.\"Yuder, please prepare guest quarters for these two.\"\"Understood. Should I request the oath from Sir Nathan?\"\u2018You're always so quick to catch on.\u2019 Pleased, Kishiar lightly tapped Yuder's gloved hand before rising from his seat.\"Heavens... I have no idea what just happened. Would you believe me if I said the conversation between the Duke and Master was harder to understand than an introductory magic textbook? I still have chills.\"Entering the guest room Yuder had prepared, Alik shivered and threw himself onto the bed. He didn't want to imagine the hidden blades that must have been exchanged in the conversation that had just taken place.All he remembered was signing the oath with a trembling hand under the terrifying smile of Duke Peletta, and Yuder kindly offering to transfer their luggage from the palace.\"Well, at least we've found our destination. Isn't that good enough?\"\"What's good about it? Why were the rumors about Duke Peletta like that until now?\"Alik shuddered as he remembered Kishiar. The Duke's smile when he casually questioned Thais at the end had seemed more terrifying than his master's angry face.\"A young, unripe beast hiding its claws is not a rare event in history. As long as we don't provoke it, it will leave us alone. We only need to finish examining the Red Stone, so be careful with your words until then, Alik.\"\"Do we have to go through all this just for research.....\"\"If you don't like it, you can go back to the tower.\"\"Ah, damn it...\"Alik sighed heavily, looking out the window of the guest room.'Does the Red Stone really exist here? It's unbelievable.'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66What Alik saw in the Cavalry quarters was utterly different from what he had imagined before arriving. Having heard they were located within the Imperial Knight's territory, he had naturally assumed they were simply using an old, hastily patched-up building. But who could have known that it was instead a place constructed anew from the ground up?The expensive materials that adorned the solidly constructed building hinted at how grand the expectations and aspirations of its creator must have been.'The people working in the palace used to chatter that Duke Peletta just made the Cavalry unit for fun after awakening... How could this place possibly have been made for amusement? They can only speak so carelessly because they've never been here!'If there were a few more people here with skills as extraordinary as Yuder Aile's, they would become a formidable force that no one could dismiss. What on earth was a duke, unable to vie for the imperial throne, doing forming such an ambitious power under the tacit approval of the emperor?The Orr Empire was a nation famed for its lack of change over a long period of time. Nobody could break the order they had established, neither from within nor without.However, Alik sighed, contemplating that he and his master might have stepped into this dangerous time where the empire was finally facing the moment of radical change.------There was one day left until the end of the seven-day vacation period.Because he had told Gakane and Kanna to take the day off, it could be considered a true day of rest. Early in the morning, Yuder, to avoid the members who were gradually returning, quietly headed out from the Imperial Knight's territory.It had been a long time since he had walked the streets in normal clothes, having shed his uniform. Numerous people brushed past Yuder as he meandered through the old, unchanged streets, sparking old memories.Originally, it was said that common people didn't live within the 7th Wall district. However, as time passed, many people snuck in, settling down, and now it had transformed into a commonplace scenery.Unlike the other districts where the majority of the buildings were built in balance as if measured, just a little way off the main street in the 7th Wall district, things quickly turned labyrinthine. This was due to the influx of those inhabitants.Yuder navigated the dizzying streets adeptly and moved forward without any hesitation. As time went by, his surroundings became progressively grimier and darker. The stench that was strong enough to rot one's nose began to waft from between the shadows of the tightly packed buildings.Eyes filled with anticipation of possibly picking the pockets of naive foreigners who lost their way in the darkness that stretched out like a spider's long legs trailed after him from the alleys. Of course, they quickly gave up when they realized that the new visitor was quite familiar with this slum.The place where Yuder stopped was in front of a very small pharmacy tucked away in an old alley. It was extremely hard for first-time visitors to identify the place. The shop itself looked precariously close to collapsing, and the sign was so worn out that it was almost impossible to read the words on it.However, as Yuder was already aware of what the place was, he did not hesitate and walked right in.\"Get out. Not open for business today.\"A voice as dreadful as a hellish shriek barked from inside the opened door, the harsh tone hardly befitting for a potential customer.Yuder paid no attention to the clutter that filled the room so densely that neither the walls nor the ceiling could be seen. Instead, his gaze was drawn to the two feet propped up nonchalantly on the counter.\"What are you doing, deaf? I told you we're not doing business! Get out!\"\"I didn't come to buy medicine.\"\"...\"The two casually swaying feet stopped in their tracks at that moment. After a while, someone raised their reclining body and leaned over the counter to reveal their face. It was hard to believe that a man with such an attractive appearance had been lying in this disorganized and filthy space.\"What? Who are you?\"Yuder recalled the past as he looked at the man's ash-gray hair and deeply furrowed brow. He felt a strange emotion upon seeing that he looked no different from the last time he had seen him in his previous life.\"I came because there's something I want to hear.\"\"...Do you know me? Who are you to come all of a sudden and speak informally and give orders?\"\"The Guardian of Luma's Seven Walls, Enon.\"Yuder's voice was calm. However, the man's expression changed significantly upon hearing his words.\"...What did you just say?\"\"The Guardian of Luma's Seven Walls....\"\"Wait. Wait a minute, wait a minute.\"The man, who quickly leaped out from behind the counter, covered Yuder's mouth. His eyes were filled with curiosity, surprise, and wariness.\"Who are you? How do you know? Who told you? Strange... I definitely don't recognize your face?\"\u2018It was none other than yourself from your previous life.\u2019Yuder regretted a bit that he couldn't say that, pointing to the hand that was covering his mouth. The meaning was that if he kept covering it like this, he wouldn't be able to answer even if he tried.Although Enon's expression was still full of skepticism, he finally removed his hand.Instead of answering his question, Yuder quietly lifted the corner of his mouth.\"I can't tell you who told me right now. But I swear it's not information I obtained unfairly. As far as I know, you have to cooperate with anyone who mentions your name. Isn't that right?\"The look in Enon's eyes changed completely to one of utter astonishment.\"How... how do you know that too? No matter how I think about it, I don't know someone like you. How on earth did this happen? Is there something wrong with my head?\"Enon might not have known Yuder, but Yuder knew him. He was the one who helped Yuder, who had been seriously injured while carrying out a secret mission for the Emperor in his previous life and was hiding briefly near the slums.He was coarse in his speech, but he was more compassionate and kind than he appeared. He knew so much that it was almost mysterious, and he often shared information deeper than most information guilds without hesitation. At that time, he claimed it was because he had heard so much from living in the slums for a long time.Several years passed in this way, and when a disaster spread across the world and Yuder started chasing the signs of something strange, Enon suddenly disappeared.Before disappearing, he once mentioned that he thought he needed to leave the capital and find out something. Yuder found the last letter he left in the medicine shop months after he had a hunch about something.The letter revealed that he was not merely an ordinary person, but a Guardian who had made a pact with the Archmage Luma long ago to protect the seven walls of the capital. It also contained a few more pieces of information related to him.\"'Believe in my words or not, that's your choice. But if we meet again and I do not remember you, mention the name 'Enon,' Luma's Guardian. Then I will certainly help you again. I wish you luck on your journey, Yudrain.'\"Enon sometimes audaciously called himself 'elder brother' and meddled with Yuder. Even though Yuder had never once called him 'elder brother,' his disappearance was included in the fleeting regrets that swept past him just before his death.\"Your head is perfectly fine. And my name is Yuder Aile. Remember it; we'll be seeing a lot of each other.\"Yuder introduced himself anew, carrying memories from their brief relationship in his past life.\"Even hearing the name, I still don't recognize it...? And why should I see you frequently?\"Enon frowned and tilted his head.\"Because you're the only person who can help me now.\"Yuder casually pulled over a chair that was left around and sat down, ignoring Enon's gaping mouth at his nonchalant attitude.Enon had the uncanny ability to discern whether a person was lying or not. Thus, from this point on, he needed to speak with the utmost honesty.\"Currently, I need information about those who have held the title of Duke in the past while possessing the castle of La Orr. Even if it's small, if you have any knowledge, please share it. Especially about Kishiar La Orr, who became a Duke under the same conditions as now.\"\"...Why are you already talking as if I've agreed to help you? Are you planning some sort of rebellion? If that's the case, I absolutely won't assist you.\"\"No, it's not. The information you give me will only be known to me, and I won't use it anywhere.\"In his past life, Yuder did not highly trust the information Enon shared because he thought it was leaked from some back alley. But this time it was different. Yuder decided to trust Enon more than the information guilds he had used and been betrayed by multiple times in the past.\"It's very important to me. I can't ask anywhere else. Please.\"At Yuder's words, Enon's eyes twitched. He let out a deep sigh and slouched, then suddenly jumped up and began pacing around the narrow shop.\"This is crazy.\"\"...\"\"You understand how tricky it is to deal with information related to the imperial family's history?\"\"I do. That's why I'm asking you.\"\"I thought my luck seemed a bit off this morning. So this was it, meeting a crazy guy like you.\"He said this, then continued pacing the shop for a while. Eventually, he knocked over one of the piles of random stuff he had collected, snapped in frustration, and finally stopped.\"...If things were as usual, I would have kicked you out. But I'll help you, just this once. You did come here in my name.\"Yuder immediately tried to express his gratitude, but Enon cut him off.\"But the information you're asking for is too dangerous and covers a wide range. Anything related to the imperial family takes a backseat for me, so it'll take some time to verify.\"\"How long?\"\"At least three days.\"\"Understood.\"Yuder immediately nodded and stood up from his seat. At this, Enon's expression became strange again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67\"Leaving so soon?\"\"I told you. I can't afford to stay out too long.\"His vacation time hadn't yet ended, but staying outside unnecessarily for too long might pique the curiosity of his colleagues or Kishiar. He had thought of some excuses beforehand, but they couldn't serve as perfect justifications.\"I'll be back in three days.\"Yuder left the old drugstore, ignoring Enon's questioning gaze. However, he failed to visit the place again three days later as he had said.An unexpected event occurred two days later.\"He hasn't returned yet?\"Yuder was standing behind Kishiar, listening to the report of his members. He was supposed to implement a new training plan he had devised from yesterday. However, there were a few members who had not yet returned despite the end of their vacation, so he had postponed it for a day. The problem was that one of the non-returnees hadn't sent any news until this very moment.Kishiar called in a few who were close to the member who hadn't returned and listened to the stories related to him. The non-returnee's name was 'Devran Hartude', an ordinary member who had never caused any problems before.All the members who were close to Devran insisted that there was no reason for him to intentionally not return.\"Devran has told us many times how happy he is to have passed the Cavalry test. He isn't the type to not return without any reason or even send news. There must be something wrong.\"One of the members who used to share a room with Devran clenched his lips and declared so. Kishiar, looking around at the faces of the members who all agreed with the same sentiment, continued his inquiry.\"Did he say anything about his hometown, where he was headed?\"\"He mentioned going to see his family. Nothing else comes to mind.\"\"I'm the same.\"Most gave the same answer. However, one hesitated for a moment, lost in thought. Kishiar immediately pointed to him with his fingertip.\"Jol, do you remember anything?\"\"Well... It's not something he mentioned this time, but something he said before... It just came to my mind. I don't know if I should mention it...\"\"You can say whatever it is.\"Encouraged by Kishiar's response, Jol, a member of the Cavalry, overcame his hesitation and began to speak.\"After joining the troop, Devran and I once discussed our backgrounds and hometowns. He said at the time that he wanted to bring his family and relatives he had left in his hometown here as soon as possible.\"\"Doesn't every commoner say that?\"Another member standing next to Jol questioned with surprise.\"Right. But then, Devran said he was worried that the lord might not allow the transfer of residence. When I asked why, he mentioned his younger sibling and suddenly looked pale, closing his mouth saying that he had said something unnecessary. It seemed like there was something going on.\"Devran's hometown was a small rural village. He wasn't sure about the life there, but if his hometown was a good place for commoners to live, he wouldn't have wished to bring his family to the capital.Yet, for a noble who valued their dignity above all else, refusing the request of a promising Cavalry member from their own territory was unthinkable. It was a place personally established by the Emperor's younger brother, Duke Peletta, and if handled well, it could forge connections with him. How could the mere relocation requests of a few commoners possibly matter?Still, if Devran had been concerned about his request being denied, it likely meant he didn't think highly of the lord ruling his homeland.\"Because of a sibling...\"Kishiar muttered under his breath, rubbing his chin thoughtfully as he considered the words he'd just heard.\"Firstly, we should send a message to the lord of Devran's homeland, asking about the situation, and send someone to investigate. What do you think, assistant?\"\"In the event something has happened to Devran, it might be too late by the time we receive a response. How about sending a message and dispatching a person at the same time?\"\"That sounds better.\"At Yuder's reply, Kishiar nodded and, as if something had just come to mind, smiled subtly.\"Speaking of which, Yuder, why don't you take responsibility and handle this?\"\"...Are you suggesting me?\"\"Who else would be better suited than you, the assistant with the greatest skills among the 330 members?\"Kishiar raised his eyebrows slightly as he asked this question, and all the members present nodded in agreement. How could the Commander himself get involved over something as minor as a member who hadn't returned from vacation? It seemed appropriate for an assistant like Yuder to handle it.Yuder, who had thought he wouldn't be sent because there were only about three weeks left until the deadline for investigating the Red Stone, was slightly taken aback. Still, he quickly composed himself.'Well, it's most likely he's simply been delayed on his way back. It makes sense to send someone who can handle this quickly.'Furthermore, there was a high possibility that Kishiar saw this as a suitable opportunity to observe Yuder's abilities. In his previous life, he had created sudden circumstances where multiple things had to be handled simultaneously to see how Yuder coped. Compared to those instances, this situation was hardly burdensome.\"Leave today without delay. I will leave the number of people you need to your discretion, so choose freely from our ranks.\"\"I will follow your command.\"Yuder swallowed a sigh that he didn't let the others hear. This would affect the training schedule he had planned for the members and the promise he had with Enon, but there was nothing he could do about it.'Devran Hartude... I need to find out what kind of guy he was before I select who will accompany me.'Yuder's memories of Devran were extremely vague. All he knew was that he didn't seem to have been in the cavalry for long in his previous life. Therefore, he decided to meet with Steiber, Sul\u2019s deputy commander, to hear information about Devran.\"Oh, Yuder, so you're going to look for Devran? If you're the one going, I'm sure it'll be resolved well... That's really fortunate.\"Steiber, with his kind face, was very pleased to hear that Yuder had taken on the task of finding Devran. He provided all the information he knew without holding back.\"Devran is from Hartan in the east. His ability is to summon fire, which is quite powerful, but he has had difficulty controlling it.\"He praised Devran's character as good-hearted, fiery like a power. He added, worried that this personality might have gotten him swept up in some unfortunate incident on his return.\"Steiber. What do you think about the possibility that Devran didn't come back on purpose?\"\"There's no way. He was never late for training even once. If something happened back home and he thought he wouldn't be able to return on time, he would have contacted the Cavalry in advance.\"Steiber's answer was firm. Yuder nodded and committed the information he'd given to memory.Those who had been close to Devran, like Steiber, all insisted that there was no way he wouldn't have returned without a reason. It was clear that he had been more than content with his life in the Cavalry, his passion overflowing.After gathering this information, Yuder decided to select members to join him in searching for Devran.'The requirements: someone with good physical strength and agility to travel quickly. Someone with skills that would aid in the search. Someone who would follow my orders without wasting time. And... finally, someone familiar with the geography and customs of Hartan or the eastern region.'The person with the most useful skills for the search was Kanna, but Yuder had decided against bringing her. He wanted her to focus on her training while he was away.After considering the remaining criteria, he found few suitable candidates. After much thought, Yuder wrote the names of his selected members on a piece of paper to report to Kishiar.\"Gakane Bolunwald. Jimmy Ocker. Hm. Are those two really enough?\"\"Yes.\"Kishiar, who received the paper from Yuder, could not hide his surprise at the only two names written on it. However, Yuder had no intention of adding more people.Gakane was more familiar with Yuder's personality and style than anyone, and his shadow clone was perfect for moving and communicating without attracting the attention of others. As for Jimmy Ocker, despite being a young boy, his knowledge of the local geography and customs, being from the East, would be a great help while also not drawing suspicion.\"Gakane, maybe. But Jimmy Ocker is still a kid, isn't he?\"\"He may be young, but isn't it you, the commander, who saw him as a capable member of the squad? From what I've observed of Jimmy so far, I judge that he can handle a mission of this magnitude.\"If the mission involved killing or something that wasn't good for emotional education, Yuder would have excluded Jimmy. But this mission's purpose was a search. During their training, Yuder had witnessed firsthand just how talented an Awakener Jimmy was.Jimmy knew the importance of the opportunity given to him. The boy was always mature, had never whined about missing his parents even during training that would make adults struggle.Considering that noble boys who entered the Imperial Knights at a young age often gave up on the path despite receiving countless privileges, Jimmy's qualities stood out.\"I assume both have agreed to accompany you on the mission.\"\"Of course.\"Just before reporting to Kishiar, Yuder called Gakane and Jimmy to explain the mission and ask if they were willing to go with him. Gakane accepted readily, and Jimmy, overwhelmed with excitement, couldn't hide his youthful emotion as he vowed to be of help.\"Alright. Then I'll trust and leave it to you.\"Kishiar nodded and folded the paper again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68\"I have just sent a letter to Lord of Hartan regarding Devran's whereabouts. If there are any changes once I receive a response, I will send you a carrier pigeon. You should also take one with you, in case something unexpected occurs and you need to contact me.\"\"I understand.\"\"Oh, and wait a moment.\"Yuder, who had turned to leave, halted and looked back. Kishiar was staring thoughtfully at a piece of parchment.\"Do you have further instructions?\"\"Yuder, you are yet to manifest your second gender, correct?\"\"...Yes, that's correct.\"Yuder was momentarily taken aback at the unexpected question about the second gender that sprung from Kishiar's lips.\"That Gakane Bolunwald accompanying you is an Alpha Awakener, am I correct?\"\"That's what I've heard.\"What on earth was Kishiar La Orr trying to say? Unable to control his facial expression due to the tension, it hardened unknowingly.\"There might be one more thing you should be mindful of. It could be a misunderstanding, but we've received a report that there seem to be signs of a second gender manifesting in Jimmy Ocker.\"\"You mean, Jimmy...?\"\"I'm not certain. There's still a lot unknown about the signs of second gender manifesting. Even if manifesting signs appear, it doesn't necessarily mean his second gender will manifest immediately.\"\"Ah... I see.\"Yuder nodded feebly, feeling his anxiety and alertness cool down at once. He felt foolish for having been so tensed up.\"Even if there are signs, it's just a slight fever. It doesn't seem likely that the kid will manifest, but it won't hurt to be cautious.\"\"I understand.\"He wondered whether it would be better not to take Jimmy with him after all, but hesitated as he remembered the boy's extremely happy face. Yuder decided that he would pay more attention to Jimmy.'After all, whether it's Gakane or Jimmy, it's the same thing for me to handle.'While he was thinking that Gakane would feel quite wronged if he knew, Kishiar studied Yuder's face and continued.\"So far, there have been no cases of a second gender manifesting within the division, but after receiving that report, I felt that it was wise to prepare related regulations in advance, as you suggested.\"Yuder blinked, feeling a strange sense of unfamiliarity.\"...Ah, yes.\"\"All the regulations related to the Cavalry should be finalized soon, so check them when you return. Once they're announced, they'll be hard to change.\"\"I understand.\"\"Once the regulations are in place, that will be the start of something new. I plan to propose a law related to Awakeners in the Imperial Law and support related research. If we hide the disadvantages in advance and show the benefits, it'll make things easier in the future. You should brace yourself for becoming busier.\"In his previous life, Yuder had gone through a lot of trouble to push through regulations and laws related to the second gender, against the opposition of greedy nobles.Back then, there were hardly any scholars conducting proper research on the abilities and physical changes of the Awakeners, and it was nearly impossible for the leader of the Cavalry, who came from a commoner background, to correct misconceptions and prejudice alone.A single Kishiar presence was all it took to swiftly shift everything around him, as he held his position as commander. Of course, starting the Cavalry immediately had been advantageous, but if Kishiar hadn't envisioned a future beyond Yuder's proposal, things would not have moved so rapidly.He couldn't change what had already happened, but what if he could have done this earlier?With a deep conviction that his latest decision hadn't been mistaken, Yuder respectfully bowed his head.------Afterwards, Yuder immediately left the cavalry, taking Gakane and Jimmy with him. This time, without the assistance of the Pearl Tower mages like before, they had to ride ordinary horses.\"We're planning to make the journey as quickly as possible, so rest time will be minimal, and we won't be looking for lodgings at night. We'll also need to change horses multiple times, so follow along well.\"\"Understood.\"\"Don't worry about me. I've ridden here on my own when I came to take the Cavalry test.\"Jimmy answered confidently, a determined expression on his face.\"On your own? Impressive. Did you run into any trouble?\"\"There was a thief who followed me trying to steal my money. Of course, once I split a rock with my sword, he vanished in terror.\"Jimmy chuckled, fondling the small sword at his waist in response to Gakane's question. They all currently carried training swords since Kishiar was in the process of preparing individual weapons for each member. But even with these, they were competent enough to show their skills, and no one complained.'He doesn't look feverish...'Yuder watched Jimmy happily riding his horse, recalling the statement about him possibly manifesting his second gender. The most common physical change before the second gender manifested was a fever lasting several days.Of course, it differed for each person. Some had different symptoms, others had no precursor symptoms at all and manifested the second gender suddenly. Yuder had been the latter.'I wasn't much different at the time of my manifesting... If it's the same as before, he doesn't have much time left.'The sudden manifesting without any prior symptoms had drastically altered his life. This time, he planned to prepare as much as possible to avoid going through the same ordeal.\"Gakane. Keep a close eye on Jimmy during the journey.\"While Jimmy was a little ahead, Yuder moved closer to Gakane, whispering in a low voice as they rode side by side.\"Huh? Something happened?\"\"The Commander mentioned that the boy is showing some symptoms of second gender manifestation. I might not be able to discern it because I'm a beginner, but you'd likely be better at it.\"\"Oh, really? The commander said that?\"Gakane's eyes widened as he looked at Jimmy's back.\"I don't sense anything yet... But okay, I'll keep an eye on him.\"\"If you sense something, let me know immediately.\"A small cage, no bigger than his palm, hung beside Yuder's saddle. Inside, a pigeon clung tightly to a small perch, seemingly unperturbed by the rocking motion. This was Yuder's means of communication.Considering that even Gakane didn't sense anything, the chance of Jimmy's manifestation seemed exceptionally low, but one never knew.If Jimmy were to manifest as an Alpha, it wouldn't be a concern. But if he manifested as an Omega, there was a chance that Gakane, being an Alpha, could be affected.'Well\u2026 I will just have to keep a closer eye to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen.'Even if such an event occurred, it was enough to isolate it.While it might have been different if it was Kishiar, who was concealing an immense power that could not even be fully comprehended, Yuder was confident that he could easily isolate individuals of Gakane and Jimmy's caliber alone.'In swordsmanship, awakener power, and divine power... Maybe it's a blessing that there aren't two of these monstrous individuals who may be hiding something else.'Even knowing Kishiar's power to some extent, Yuder could not guess where the limit of his abilities lay.Yuder shook his head, casting away the unnecessary thoughts that had come to him.'Let's focus on what's right in front of us.'They had ridden horses relentlessly throughout the day. Whenever a horse was exhausted, they quickly borrowed a replacement from a nearby village.The pass that Kishiar provided before their departure had been incredibly useful. They were treated like messengers carrying the emperor's decree, allowing them to easily borrow horses from any village, whether from the local guards or the steeds raised by the lords.The pace would have been unbearable for an ordinary person, but it was lighter than the regular training the Awakeners like them received. Even Jimmy did not show any signs of fatigue.\"Jimmy. Your hometown is near Devran's, right? How close is it exactly?\"While riding, Gakane asked Jimmy various questions related to the Eastern region. Jimmy's parents owned a quite well-known shop in the Eastern region, and so he had picked up a lot of useful information.\"It shouldn't take more than a few hours? Quite a few people used to come to the village where I lived from Hartan to shop.\"Jimmy disparaged Hartan as a very small, insignificant village. It barely had any shops, and the market did not flourish, so the inhabitants had to go to other villages to buy anything.\"I heard the lord there is quite old. He doesn't take much interest in his subjects and has a married daughter and two sons, if I remember correctly.\"\"Who's next in line for the lordship once the current lord passes away?\"\"The eldest will definitely inherit it. Since the eldest daughter is married, perhaps she will come and take over?\"\"The atmosphere is quite different from the South.\"Gakane, who was from the South, murmured thoughtfully.\"Where I come from, the youngest inherits everything the parents owned until the end, be it titles or anything else.\"\"Wow, that's even more strange. Then what happens to the older siblings?\"\"The older ones receive more support while growing up and often establish themselves independently. But what does the youngest have except for the parents? So isn't it right for the elder siblings to yield?\"At Gakane's words, Jimmy opened his mouth and tilted his head.\"Uh... when you put it that way, it does seem to make sense?\"\"Haha. Come visit sometime. You'll be surprised.\"\"I'll do that.\"Watching the two who looked like close brothers, Yuder surveyed the surroundings. As they had chosen the fastest route, they had strayed from the safe trade route, making the surroundings extremely dark and eerily quiet. However, Jimmy was the one who had told them this was the quickest way.'Judging from the well-trodden ground and the surrounding conditions, this seems to be a frequently used path. But it's a bit odd that it's so deserted. It feels as if something's about to jump out...'\"Halt, you scoundrels!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Halt, you scoundrels!\"Just at that moment, a few people stepped out to block the path as if they'd read Yuder's thoughts, shouting out in defiance.\"How dare you tread on the path we linger! You should be ready to pay the toll.\"\"Ah, right. It's them. The ones I encountered when I came for the Cavalry test.\"Jimmy, who had been chattering with Gakane, looked at their faces and whispered lightly.\"It seems there is no change even after some time.\"His tone was as if he was not dealing with bandits, but greeting familiar faces from a long lost home town. The bandits, thinking it odd that the three seated calmly on their horses were not startled, lit their torches and approached.\"What, did these kids freeze in fear? Why aren't they saying anything\u2026\"One of the bandits with a rough face scarred from knife wounds approached and, seeing Jimmy on his horse, suddenly closed his mouth.\"What's up, why'd you stop talking? As I was saying about the toll\u2026\"Another bandit who followed suit stopped mid-sentence as well.\"What's the matter? What's wrong\u2026 You, you are!\"\"Hello. You're still here, I see.\"Jimmy rubbed his nose as he greeted them from atop his horse. Of course, the recipients of the greeting did not appreciate his cheerful salutation.\"Bloody hell. It's the kid who said he was going to take some kind of test last time!\"\"You, you\u2026 don't tell me you failed? Is that why you came back? Dammit!\"\"No, I passed, of course. I have two other companions here with me besides myself.\"Jimmy pointed at Yuder and Gakane with a smile. Only then did the bandits seem to realize the existence of the other two, their eyes darting in shock and fear.\"Don't tell me, those two are also\u2026 like you, cutting rocks with their swords\u2026?\"\"Ah. They are far more impressive than I am. How can you compare them to me, who is merely 12 years old?\"\"Damn it, retreat. Retreat! Run!\"Just as Jimmy finished speaking, one of the bandits closest to them started running, waving his hands wildly. The other bandits, as if they had been waiting for such an order, scampered away without even looking back.A sudden wind picked up on the dark mountain path, and the torch held by one of the bandits was hastily extinguished. The remaining bandits, who were further away, seemed to notice something was up and promptly vanished into the shadows.\"They fled already, and we didn't even do anything yet. What should we do?\"Jimmy murmured, looking worried as he watched their swift departure.\"Indeed. Hmm. Should we chase them?\"Gakane also turned to Yuder, a hint of uncertainty in his eyes. Normally, they would have given chase, but they were currently on an urgent mission to find Devran Hartude.\"What do you think, Yuder?\"\"Summon the shadow clone to chase. Block the path and catch as many as possible.\"\"Got it.\"At Yuder's order, the shadow clone of Gakane sprung forth from under his horse, darting in the direction the bandits had fled at an incredible speed. It moved so fast it was incomparable to a human running.\"Jimmy. Since when have bandits been lurking around here?\"As Gakane's shadow clone was carrying out its task, Yuder, with an impassive face, asked Jimmy. Lost in thought, Jimmy frowned slightly.\"Hmm. I'm not quite sure. In fact, there were many people who used to take this path until last year. But when I told my parents that I would be going alone to take the Cavalry test, they absolutely forbade me from going this way. They said it was dangerous because bandits had claimed the route and were demanding a toll. But it's much quicker than any other way, so... hehe.\"\"So, you're saying they've been here for at least a year.\"\"Why? Is that a significant point?\"Gakane, manipulating his shadow, tilted his head and turned his gaze towards Yuder. Thanks to the grueling training he had been doing, he was now able to control his shadow with a fair amount of ease. Yuder opened his mouth quietly, directing his words at both Gakane and Jimmy.\"Have you two not noticed it yet?\"\"Noticed what?\"\"I don't understand what you're saying.\"\"There're Awakeners among those bandits.\"\"\u2026What? Oh no.\"The moment Gakane opened his mouth in surprise, a thud and a scream echoed from afar. It seemed he had accidentally used his shadow control too forcefully.\"Awakeners? Then why did they run away after seeing us? They wouldn't have needed to. No, more importantly, Yuder, how did you know that?\"\"Torchlight. Wind. Darkness.\"\"Huh?\"\"Ah, I see. I understand now!\"At Yuder's enigmatic words, Jimmy immediately brightened and exclaimed.\"They approached us with a torch, even though they hadn't been carrying one from the beginning. And when they ran away, the wind suddenly blew! And there's no moon or stars visible in the sky!\"They were all correct. Only then did Gakane look up at the sky, surprised at the pitch-black darkness where neither moon nor stars could be seen.\"I didn't realize. How did this happen? Despite the sky being so dark, I didn't find it strange because I could see my surroundings so clearly.\"Even this acceptance of the situation could be due to someone's ability. Yuder, swallowing his final answer, watched as Gakane's shadow clone handled three bandits who were struggling in the shadow's grasp.\"Let me go! Let me go!\"\"Damn. I told you I had a bad feeling for the past few days and suggested we stop our operations until the boss returns, didn't I?\"\"Shut up, you stinky bastard. Your butt is poking my face!\"\"I've been telling you over and over that I've had a bad feeling since the fire the other day!\"\"So what does that have to do with us!\"Yuder dismounted his horse to look down at the bandits, who were cursing and struggling. Gakane and Jimmy followed suit.\"Gakane.\"\"Yeah.\"Just hearing his name was enough; Gakane instantly understood Yuder's intention. As soon as the shadow clone released the bandits, the three men collapsed on the ground, screaming in pain.\"Ouch! Ah, my back!\"\"Damn it, if you're going to kill us, do it quickly! But you won't be able to get anything from us! Our boss will avenge us!\"As the noisy bandits yelled out, Yuder took a closer look at their faces. In the dim light of the flickering torch, he hadn't noticed it before, but they were all younger than he had initially thought. Only one of them was carrying a knife.If they were the type to make a living from such activities, they wouldn't have been so poorly armed. Yuder's curiosity about their true identities grew stronger.\"Why are Awakeners here, acting like bandits, extracting tolls?\"\"What's it to you? What do you know? Stop blabbing.\"Instead of answering, Yuder conjured a flame in his palm. Though small, the threatening flame flared brightly, illuminating their surroundings and drawing everyone's gaze. Fear and alarm flashed across the faces of the three bandits.\"Yuder, you can now summon flames without a sword?\"Unable to hide his amazement, Gakane whispered in his ear.\"With the wind, with the fire\u2026 How does your ability keep developing like this?\"The truth was, he had been capable of doing it all along. But had he said that, Gakane would surely have asked why he'd kept it a secret. The only answer Yuder could provide, as before, was...\"...Training with you guys has improved me somewhat.\"\"Somewhat? You call this somewhat?\"\"Hey, can we just talk this out? Yes, we made a mistake in not recognizing who we were dealing with and asking for a toll. But we're not like that, really. We're good guys. We've never killed anyone, we just took a tiny, tiny toll when people passed through! Don't forget you're the one who brought us here when we did nothing!\"Thankfully, one of the bandits raised his voice, preventing Gakane from asking further. Feeling slightly grateful to the bandits, Yuder approached them. As he did, fear heightened on the bandits' faces.\"I just want an answer to my question.\"\"If... if we answer, you won't kill us, right?\"\"Keep your mouth shut when talking to the enemy...\"Yuder extended his other hand and summoned a gust of wind. The bandit who had tried to talk was silenced by the fierce wind that hit his jaw, closing his mouth in an instant.Witnessing Yuder simultaneously wielding wind and fire, the bandits' eyes widened in terror.\"Let me ask you again. Why are people who wouldn't normally do this sort of thing acting as bandits here? Including Awakeners.\"\"...\"\"Answer me.\"\"I'll answer that if you let my brothers go.\"\"Boss!\" The bandits turned around in unison and cried out. Yuder looked at a man who had appeared out of nowhere.He was a remarkably handsome young man, too young to be believed to be a bandit leader. However, the left half of his face was horribly scarred, and his left eye had lost its color, with the pupil dilated, inducing a feeling of fright rather than his inherent handsomeness.Among the people Yuder had met, this man, with a starkly different impression from the most beautiful man Kishiar, left an unforgettable impact.\"Did you start all this? Leading them into this mess?\"\"No. The sequence of events is the reverse.\"The man answered surprisingly calmly.\"They first fled from the tyranny of a noble, and then they met me.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 70Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Tyranny?\"\"Well, isn't that a common tale? So common that it hardly needs explaining.\"As the man spoke, the bandits surreptitiously rose from their seats. When Yuder did not bother to stop them, they swiftly ran to hide behind the man's back.\"Boss, how did the mission go?\"\"I can't make head nor tail of what's going on. Knights showing up, fires breaking out, and now these characters... something wicked must be afoot.\"Knights and fire. Amid their whispered conversation, Yuder picked out these words that tickled his curiosity, causing him to frown.\"What do you mean by 'knights' and 'fire'?\"\"You folks, you came here from the capital, didn't you? Looking for someone.\"The bandit leader replied with a counter-question. Yuder noticed a strange energy simmering within the man's intact right eye and hesitated momentarily before nodding.\"That's correct. Judging from your words, you seem to know something?\"\"I wouldn't say 'know,' exactly. I do recall a man dressed like you all visiting a nearby village a few days ago.\"\"Devran.\"Gakane muttered in a low voice.\"We don't know his name. But three days ago, a sudden fire broke out in that village. By the time it was finally extinguished after half a day, half the village, including the lord's castle, had disappeared.\"\"Fire?\"Yuder recalled that Devran's power was fire-related. An uneasy premonition swept over him, and a mysterious smile emerged on the bandit leader's face, as if to underline his foreboding.\"The man was captured on the scene as a suspect and was locked up in prison. I went over there briefly to examine the cause of the fire and the situation in the area, and heard stories related to him. Everyone is buzzing that his execution is imminent.\"\"Could Devran really have...? What should we do?\"Jimmy, at a loss for what to do, turned to Yuder. What he had assumed to be a simple reconnaissance mission had suddenly escalated into an alarming crisis.Yuder, suppressing his shocked expression better than Gakane and Jimmy, calmed his racing mind. Considering the situation, it seemed highly likely that Devran was the arsonist the bandit leader spoke of. However, nothing could be certain until he verified it personally.Moreover, the oddly submissive and friendly demeanor of the bandit leader did not sit well with him.\"What about the knights you lot were chatting about?\"\"Ah, that's nothing significant. Just yesterday, knights in shining armor passed through here. My brothers, who intended to collect a toll, were completely taken aback at the sight of them, as it was their first encounter with such distinguished guests. However, it turned out that they were not here because of the fire, but for their internal knightly training. They passed through here to a mountain next to the village where the fire broke out.\"The bandit leader casually shrugged as he answered.It was a tradition for renowned knight orders to conduct their training in remote rural areas. It appeared that a portion of them had come here.\"Well, that's all I know. Anything else you want to ask?\"The leader's soft gaze landed on Yuder's face. Yuder felt there was something odd about his eyes but was frustrated as he could not yet pinpoint what it was.\"You and your henchmen, you plan on being half-baked bandits here indefinitely?\"\"Half-baked bandits, is that how it appears to you?\"The man retorted in an exaggerated tone, letting out a low chuckle.\"I was actually considering leaving this place soon. I can't live in the empire anymore, with my criminal record and all. There's no other way.\"\"You make it sound like you had no other choice.\"\"Because I genuinely had no choice.\"A smile surfaced on the leader's face, chilling the observer. It was because his contorted, motionless left side of the face, and his cruel yet beautiful right side composed a disconcerting harmony.\"None of the brothers here believe they've committed a grave enough crime to warrant leaving their hometown. Do you think picking someone's pocket on the road warrants death?\"\"What nonsense.\"As Gakane sharply interjected, the leader's right eye turned toward him. The gaze was unbelievably soft.\"All my brothers were ostracized, falsely accused, and chased away merely for having awakened their abilities. Granted, we had to leave where we were living and ended up like this, but we have our own rules and conscience. Unlike those who drove us away.\"The leader's voice was low and gentle. But at the same time, it held an odd strength. Yuder began to wonder what his power could be.'He probably wouldn't tell me even if I asked.'\"Are you one of those who was driven out?\"\"Me? Ha-ha. Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.\"\"Do you think we'll just sit back and watch you guys leave?\"Gakane cut in, and the leader tilted his head.\"Then what else can you do?\"Gakane's eyebrows twitched, as if he hadn't expected the leader to retort that way.\"What?\"\"I've given you all the necessary information. If you don't find the person you're looking for right now, that person will soon be executed. Yet, you have time to catch small-time thieves like us? Ha-ha. There's a priority in everything, brother. If you try to catch us first, we'll resist with all our might. You can't catch two rabbits at once.\"\"Why am I your brother?\"\"If we have the same power, aren't we all brothers, if not sisters?\"Not making any sense, this guy must be crazy. Yuder read such thoughts from Gakane's eyes, which turned to him.'...Definitely cunning. He figured out why we're here in such a short time and played it this way.'Moreover, the fact that the leader wasn't wrong provoked Yuder's wariness even more.Yuder glanced at the leader's face for a moment, then exhaled briefly. If he used all his power here, he could capture those in front of him. But it was clear that it wouldn't end there, not knowing where the bandits' hideout was.As they said, they were small-time thieves, for now.'And they don't show hostility towards us.'\"Are you angry? Or surprised? It's nice to finally see some change in that icy expression of yours.\"The leader, noticing the slight change in Yuder's expression, asked with a laugh.\"I was just thinking.\"\"Thinking?\"\"How many days do you estimate it would take to solve this matter, return, and round you all up?\"\"...\"His voice was soft, but the implications were as chilling as a well-honed blade. The bandits who had been lurking behind their leader and watching the proceedings jumped back with a start when their eyes met Yuder's. They instinctively felt that his words were not in jest.\"...Ha, ha. Look at that. We have a formidable brother amongst us today.\"\"I have no brother like you.\"\u2018That's it, Yuder! Way to go!\u2019 Gakane clenched his fist and cheered silently, his face beaming with satisfaction.\"Shouldn't there be a comeback if there is a departure? We never harm the innocent. My brethren, at my request, do not lay hands on those who share our powers. We are the losers who have lost everything for the past two years, and all that's left for us is to flee and survive. Even so, you want to arrest us?\"His tongue, soft as a velvet snake, stirred guilt that lay dormant. Jimmy appeared to be moved by his words, his face grimacing as if he were about to cry.But who could vouch that his words were true? As long as it was unclear what truths and lies he hid within his cunning words, it was impossible to believe everything he said.Yuder Aile had seen too many scenes play out to be swayed by such sentimental manipulations.Yuder stood, blocking Jimmy's view, and spoke.\"If I were you, I'd use the time you're wasting on wordplay to flee further. Don't misconstrue your priorities. It seems that my priorities might change at any moment.\"At Yuder's fierce words, the leader's eyes widened a bit, followed by a burst of laughter.\"Ha, ha, ha.\"\"Le, leader, let's go.\"\"Why do you keep provoking him? He's not ordinary.\"\"You go first.\"The leader quietly commanded the bandits who tried to hold him back. His voice, following his laughter, was both warm and chilling.\"Huh?\"\"I think I have something more to say to these people.\"\"Wh, what do you mean? How can we go somewhere without you? How can....\"\"I can catch up later. Go back and tell Ersi to leave first. I'll be right there.\"\"Leader...!\"The bandits wore confused expressions, but after a moment, they nodded. Despite their lack of understanding, their obedience suggested that their leader had their absolute trust.\"We'll wait for you, so make sure to come, leader!\"As the bandits called out desperately and disappeared, the leader, who had lightly waved his hand at them, turned his body and looked at Yuder. Despite being left alone, his gaze was remarkably relaxed.\"Thank you for not capturing my brethren.\"\"There's no need to catch the tail when you can go for the head.\"Hearing Yuder's reply, the leader smirked, his left eye gleaming with an inscrutable light in the darkness.\"So, what is it that you want to say to us?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"So, what is it that you wish to tell us?\"\"I propose a collaboration. I will guide and assist you, and in return, you stop pursuing my brethren.\"\"We refuse.\"Yuder's response was cold and swift. Despite the man's purported sacrificial stance for his subordinates, Yuder didn't sense a shred of noble determination or the caution of a negotiator from him. And why should he accept the proposal of a seemingly tricky fellow without a compelling reason?Nevertheless, despite the chilly refusal, the man merely tugged at one corner of his lips, showing no signs of defeat or despair.\"Rather blunt. But that's to be expected if you're still unfamiliar with the obstinacy and arrogance of the Eastern nobles. Even if you were on an imperial mandate, it wouldn't be easy here. How fast do you think you can achieve your goal among yourselves? In my opinion, it seems impossible.\"\"Do you know something more?\"\"If you're curious, accept my proposal.\"\"...\"\"There will be no harm to you, I promise.\"Even in this unfavorable situation, his audacity clearly stemmed from a confidence in something.If it had been up to Yuder, he would have thrashed the man soundly and forced the truth out of him, but this tactic worked with some and not with others. And, unfortunately, Yuder's instinct told him that this man would not be swayed by such an approach.'If Kishiar was here instead of me...'Yuder suddenly thought of the absent Kishiar. Kishiar might have left this man to his devices, just to see what he would do out of pure curiosity. That was his way.His method was risky, but it had definite advantages. When confident in superior power, there was no better way to obtain information.'And this mission is an exploration mission. It has always been my weak point.'Yuder made a decision. Whatever abilities the man in front of him might have, Yuder did not sense that he was stronger. If it was within tolerable limits, it might be okay to mimic Kishiar just once and follow the man's lead.\"Fine.\"\"Yuder?\"Gakane was startled by the short agreement that followed a lengthy silence and called Yuder's name. He had naturally expected Yuder to refuse the man's proposal. Yuder gestured to reassure him before continuing.\"Do as you wish. You'd probably follow us anyway, even if we refused.\"\"You've caught on. You're right.\"The man with the odd scar smiled calmly and nodded.\"But before that, tell me the real reason why you\u2019ll try to follow us and what the Eastern nobles are hiding.\"\"Impatient, aren't we?\"\"If I don't like the preliminary information, I'll arrest you on the spot and turn you over to the guards.\"\"You seem to have done quite a bit of threatening. Fine. Mutual trust is important, after all.\"With those words, the man raised his hand lightly, swirling the air.Suddenly, the atmosphere around them changed dramatically as if a veil had been lifted, revealing the true sky. Beneath the brightly shining moon and stars, a peaceful mountain landscape appeared. A new horse that had not been visible before was quietly tied to a tree, grazing on the grass.The man effortlessly loosed the reins of the bound horse and climbed upon it. Everyone was unable to contain their astonishment at such a natural display.\"The sky has suddenly cleared! The horse too... Is this that man's power?\"\"Little brother is smarter than he looks.\"The man answered in a low voice, understanding Jimmy's question, whispered to Yuder, loud and clear.\"Exactly as you said. This is indeed my power.\"\"...An illusion?\"Yuder asked quietly. The man nodded, a gleam passing over his seemingly ordinary eyes.\"Yes. It's not as impressive as your abilities, but it has various uses. Thanks to this power, despite my appearance, I can be free anywhere and quickly notice when guests like you arrive.\"His explanation was ambiguous, but they could guess what he meant. His illusionary ability exceeded merely hiding his grotesque appearance, it was exceptional enough to cover an entire area and detect those who intruded upon it.Yuder had met a few illusion-casters in his past life. However, their abilities were not as exceptional as the man before him. He wondered if the individuals possessing such a level of skill had met an early death while hanging out with bandits in his previous life.\"So, you were so confident because you thought you could escape anytime. Even knowing what your ability is, it would be difficult to detect it... troublesome.\"Gakane also seemed to understand the hidden intent in the man's words, murmuring with a grimace on his face.\"Now, let's discuss the details while on our way. It's not far to the village, but it would be best to get there as soon as possible.\"At the man's suggestion, Yuder quietly climbed onto a horse. Gakane and Jimmy also mounted horses. They followed the leisurely advancing man, without letting their guard down.\"Among my brothers, there was one originally in charge of visiting the village to keep tabs on the situation and buy food supplies. However, some time ago, this brother headed to the village as usual but didn't return. The other brothers thought he had run away with the money for the food, but I didn't think so.\"The voice of the scarred man was surprisingly clear, audible even amidst the rustling wind in the dark and the noise of the horses' hooves against the ground.\"That brother was surely caught. But I couldn't save him until now because I didn't know where he was imprisoned. Not until the person you are looking for came here.\"\"What does that have to do with it?\"Jimmy bravely frowned and asked his question.\"The old lord and the couple who had visited to receive their title early died in a fire that day. Despite such a big incident, the remaining two sons have yet to report it to the capital. The whole village is buzzing that the man you're looking for will soon be executed, but no one knows where he's imprisoned. His family members also disappeared somewhere after that day, but no one talks about it. Don't you think that's strange?\"\"...Does it mean that someone deliberately confined them somewhere and is trying to quietly bury the incident?\"When Yuder asked curtly, the man turned to look back at him.\"In the east, they respect the House of Duke Diarca more than the emperor.\"His answer flowed out, seeming a bit irrelevant.\"Did you know that ever since rumors spread that the recent Emperor had his younger brother form a Cavalry, persecutions against the Awakeners have intensified in the East? That there has been an increase in cases where Awakeners of commoner origin, possessing notable abilities, were suddenly framed and unjustly imprisoned? No one knows where they've gone.\"\"I haven't heard of such things happening around here before I left for the test! Of course, unlike the capital, there were many people here who were afraid of the Awakeners\u2026\"\"Jimmy.\"Yuder called out Jimmy's name curtly, compelling him to close his mouth. But the man had already turned his attention to Jimmy.\"Just because you're from here, it doesn't mean you know everything. Especially a young boy like you, your exposure to information is limited. But were your parents also like that?\"At the man's words, Jimmy's expression changed instantly.\"What do you mean?\"\"Usually, no matter how strong they are, they wouldn't send a young child alone to such a distant place. But what if they thought it was more dangerous to stay here than going to the capital.\"His low voice sent a strong ripple through everyone's minds.\"Was it the little brother's decision to take the Cavalry test? Or was it instigated by the parents' suggestion? What did they say to do if you failed the exam? Did they tell you to come right back? If it were me, I would have asked someone I know to look after you, and told you to stay there for a while.\"\"...\"Yuder read the shock in Jimmy's open mouth and trembling eyes. It suggested that the man's conjecture wasn't too far from the truth.\"I'm not lying. After I came here, in a few months, the East became increasingly hard for people like us to live. Many of my brethren have fled here like that.\"Yuder thought about the man's mention of the 'East, where the influence of the Diarca Ducal House is stronger than the Emperor.'The history of the repeated rivalry and alliance between the Imperial House of the Orr Empire and the Four Ducal Houses was exceedingly long. When the imperial authority was strong, the power of the ducal houses weakened, and vice versa.In his past life, the Emperor Yuder served was a foster son of the Diarca Ducal House, so he did not antagonize the ducal houses. But what about the current Emperor?If Kishiar had judged that the power of the Cavalry created was beneficial to the Emperor, the Four Ducal Houses would have worked to obstruct it.Could the sudden arrest of Devran, a member of the cavalry, here be related to that? He would have to meet Devran to be sure, but it seemed a high probability.'In my previous life, there was no general vacation at this time, and Devran didn't disappear, so I couldn't have known that such a thing was happening in the East.'\"I think there's a high chance that the one you're looking for is being held in the same place as my brother, or at least knows something that could be a clue.\"The man finished his story saying he had followed Yuder and the Cavalry members for that reason. Yuder felt that he wasn't lying, but he didn't let down his guard.The cold, chilling gaze that did not hide even when he called everyone with the same power a brother, was not to his liking. Was his reason for taking the risk to join them really just because of his comrades?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYuder's gaze drifted towards the small birdcage hanging next to his horse. It seemed he might have to send a courier to Kishiar more swiftly than he'd initially thought upon arriving in the village.\u2014---\"Your Grace, a courier has just arrived from the East,\" a voice informed him.\"Is it from the Lord of Hartan?\"\"No, it's a report from our spy in a nearby village.\"Seated at his desk, buried in paperwork filled with complex laws, Kishiar finally shifted his gaze to his adjutant, Nathan.\"A report?\"\"Do you remember when you ordered me to recruit several spies in the East to monitor the long-term movements there? One of them. I inquired if he knew anything about this matter and the answer came quickly.\"Kishiar had not taken lightly the fact that a Cavalry member, originally from the East and on leave, had not yet returned. The East, where the Ducal faction was gaining ground, had been subtly pushing back against the Awakeners ever since Kishiar expressed his desire to form the Cavalry.While the incident was likely minor, there was a possibility that some foolish noble had insulted the Cavalry member, and by extension, Kishiar and the Emperor.For this reason, he had instructed Nathan to investigate all possible leads for information, beyond the direct letter he sent to the Lord of Hartan. The reply from the Lord of Hartan was yet to arrive, but the answer from another source came unexpectedly quickly, which did not sit well with Kishiar.Kishiar broke the seal on the letter Nathan handed to him and read it quickly. His red eyes cooled significantly after a moment.\"So, there's been a fire.\"\"\u2026In Hartan?\"\"Yes, and it's rumored that the Lord's castle burned completely. The timing coincides with Devran Hartude's stay in Hartan. Might be a coincidence, but we can't be sure.\"\"But there was no report from the Black Pigeon about this.\"Of the countless events that occurred daily across the country, disasters were critical reports that needed immediate communication.If a fire severe enough to consume the entire Lord's castle had occurred, naturally, an immediate report should have reached the capital administration via couriers. Yet, even their spies in nearby villages didn't know the extent of the casualties; something was suspicious.One could argue that the delay in handling the incident caused the report to be late. Still, Kishiar remembered that Devran Hartude had the power to conjure fire.\"Oh, another courier has arrived.\"At that moment, Nathan, standing by the window, caught another small bird that had flown in.\"Is it from Hartan?\"\"I'm sorry, but it isn't. It's a letter from another spy in the East.\"\"What does it say?\"Kishiar asked his adjutant to read out the new message. As Nathan unfolded the small pouch tied to the bird's leg and read the letter, his expression shifted slightly.\"It's an irregular report unrelated to the current incident. It says that ten Imperial Knights have come to train at Mount Clayman.\"\"Isn't Mount Clayman near Hartan?\"Kishiar's memory, which had the entire continental map memorized, was unquestionably flawless.\"Indeed it is. And among the knights who went for training this time, it seems Kiolle da Diarca is present.\"Kishiar's handsome lips curled into a subtle smirk.\"Huh. Is that scoundrel there? I thought he'd learned a lesson after getting scolded by my assistant, but it seems that wasn't the case?\"Kiolle da Diarca was the youngest son of Duke Diarca, who had spoiled him so much that he didn't listen to anyone and earned a notorious reputation. The Duke arranged a place for his youngest son in the Imperial Knight to lead a comfortable life, but this hope was beautifully shattered with the recent formation of the Cavalry.Kiolle, who was humiliated for the first time in his life by a common-born Cavalry member, Yuder Aile, in the training field, could not contain his fury and contacted Kishiar numerous times. The calls were almost threats, demanding immediate expulsion of the audacious Cavalry member and sending him to the Diarca family.Of course, Kishiar ignored all of it. Just when he thought the matter was finally settled and forgotten, a few days ago, Yuder once again encountered Kiolle and bestowed upon him an even greater insult.Assuming that there would be another round of complaints, but receiving none, Kishiar thought Kiolle had finally learned some humility. However, it appeared that Duke Diarca had simply intervened, sending his son away for training.\"Predictable. The old man must have sent him away to cool his head, given all the trouble he's causing.\"\"Do you think the Duke knew something when he sent him?\"\"If he had known anything, that old man Duke Diarca would never have sent Kiolle there, Nathan.\"Unlike the cautious question from Nathan, Kishiar's answer was bitterly sarcastic.\"He may have lost a few teeth due to old age, but an old lion is still a lion. The person who best understands his youngest son's abilities, coldly and clearly, is none other than himself.\"\"Still, if they happen to meet again at that place... I'm not sure it will turn out well this time.\"There was no telling what would happen if, by any chance, Yuder and Kiolle were to encounter each other again in the eastern region, where the reach of the Duke's family was strong. It seemed like a great misfortune.When Nathan voiced his slight concern, Kishiar shook his head.\"There's no need to worry about my assistant, even if something happens. ...What's more concerning is the report about the fire.\"\"I'll look into that further.\"\"Do that. And Nathan, be prepared to go there at any moment if necessary.\"\"Do you want me to deliver the message personally?\"At the unexpected command, Nathan's eyes narrowed.\"Yes. It's better not to go, but just in case, we need to be prepared.\"\"Understood.\"The loyal adjutant did not ask for reasons.\"Now, let's call upon the mages who have been on their feet all day.\"Kishiar realized that the fact Thais Yulman and his disciple could come here was due to the information leaked by Duke Diarca. The fact that they simply provided information to the mages of the Pearl Tower, who didn't have much connection with the Duke's family, meant they didn't show much interest in the power of the Red Stone.'Fortunate, indeed.'All the nobles knew that the Emperor's health was deteriorating day by day. If they knew that Kishiar and the Emperor were hoping for a miracle through the unknown power within the Red Stone, the dukes would have done whatever it took to eliminate it. Or, knowing the power of the stone, they would have sent a perfect spy who would be prepared to die to report to the dukes.In this regard, the deep-seated character of a true mage in Thais Yulman, who had come here, was quite fortunate for Kishiar. Thais was a leading authority in such research, and he was stubborn enough to willingly finger his pledge that he would keep his mouth shut forever as long as he could conduct his research.Perhaps Duke Diarca had leaked the information thinking that Thais would investigate the Red Stone and eavesdrop on the news he would send to the Pearl Tower. But did he really expect that Thais would pledge to keep his mouth shut so easily and even bear a grudge against his youngest son?Kishiar felt quite pleased when he thought about how the Duke would react when he found out about this later.The face of Yuder Aile, who suggested using Thais, came to mind. His assistant seemed to have a great talent for ruining what the greedy Dukes wanted. It was a skill he liked.------\u201cOnce we pass through the guards you see over there, we'll be in Hartan.\u201dThe man with a scar on his face paused as he gestured towards the guards positioned not far off. Behind the stone wall and the watchtower they were guarding, the outline of a village could be seen just as he had described. Yuder stepped forward, leading the group towards the guards.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cWe are Cavalry members who have been dispatched by Duke Kishiar La Orr Peletta, the Commander of the Cavalry.\u201d\u201cThe Cavalry?\u201dFor a moment, Yuder noticed a heavy wariness pass over the faces of the guards.\u201c\u2026Show us some evidence to verify your identity.\u201d\u201cHere it is.\u201dYuder produced the identity certificate he had received from Kishiar. After reading the paper several times with a cautious gaze, the guard returned it with a heavy voice.\u201cSo it is. Seems correct. Four people, correct?\u201dTheir gaze swept over Yuder and the others behind him. Yuder assumed that the guards would certainly be startled at the sight of the man with a huge scar on his face, but their expressions were remarkably calm.Finding this strange, Yuder turned around and was surprised to see the face of the man standing behind Gakane and Jimmy had transformed into someone else\u2019s.While the man still had a noticeable scar, his handsome face had disappeared, and instead, the average face of one of the bandits they had encountered on the mountain and fled from was there. Moreover, he was wearing a cavalry uniform identical to Yuder's.It looked no different from the real thing, but it was definitely a form made by overlaying an illusion.'Using illusion abilities like this.'The man smiled slightly as his eyes met Yuder's. It seemed that there was no need to worry about the scar on his face thanks to the ability to show illusions, and indeed, it was a remarkable skill. If he hadn't seen and heard of his abilities beforehand, he might have suspected him to be a shape-shifter.\u201c\u2026Yes. Four people. Correct.\u201d\u201cAnd your purpose?\u201d\u201cWe wish to meet and speak with the Lord.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYuder had purposefully obscured his true intentions. His original aim was to find traces of Devran Hartude, but to do that, he needed to meet the Lord anyway. This question could also confirm the extent to which the information given by the bandit was true.Sure enough, the expressions of the guards darkened instantly, suggesting Yuder was not wrong in his thinking.\"You seem to have come from afar and have not heard the news yet. Our lord passed away in an accident a few days ago.\"\"Is that so? Then, who is currently in charge of the village?\"\"The Lord's eldest daughter, Lady Sabelrina, and her husband, Sir Ryel, also met with misfortune on the same day... Currently, the youngest son, Lord Zakail, is taking care of the funeral arrangements and the aftermath.\"\"Then, I must meet him.\"\"Please do so. In fact, today is the last day of the funeral, and all the villagers are finishing the rites at the back of the mountain. You should find them there. Ah, and before that, outsiders are required to leave their horses at our stables. Please hand over your reins.\"The guard returned Yuder's identification. They watched, their eyes full of suspicion, as Yuder pocketed his ID.Yuder watched as Gakane and Jimmy handed over their reins to the guards, and then he carefully opened the door of the small birdcage hanging from his saddle.Feeling the gaze of the bandit leader on him as he took out the small bird and turned it over his shoulder, Yuder sensed a curiosity about what he might do next.Ignoring the man's gaze, Yuder quickly conjured up a dust storm. As the gritty wind blew dirt onto the faces of the guards, startled voices echoed from all directions.\"Damn, what is this?\"Taking advantage of the moment when the guards closed or covered their faces, Yuder released his messenger bird. The bird, trained to fly around for a day without a letter and then return, would be back by the time Yuder called for it within a day.'Even if they see the birdcage, they'd realize it had a messenger bird. But there's nothing I can do about it.'As he passed the guard post and entered the outskirts of the village, the first thing he noticed was the heavy smell of burnt wood that pricked his nostrils.Yuder picked up a stick from the ground and lit it. He could have conjured fire with magic, but using a torch would raise less suspicion should he encounter anyone.Under the flickering torchlight, the sight of scorched earth and burnt plants confirmed the truth of the rumor that half the village had been set ablaze.\"Over there, is that the castle?\"Unable to hide his anxious voice, Jimmy whispered to Yuder and pointed at something black in the distance. It wasn't very large, but it was unmistakably a castle. The sight of its excessively dark silhouette in the night provoked an eerie sensation.\"There really is no one in the village. They must all have gone to the back mountain.\"\"That over there looks like a cornfield... It's all burnt. It's the harvest season now...\"As Gakane mumbled, scanning the surroundings, Jimmy added another comment, looking at the blackened field. Yuder turned his head towards the bandit leader, who was quietly walking. The man was still wearing the image of his subordinate in military uniform.\"How long do you plan to keep this charade?\"\"Isn't it strange if I'm the only one dressed differently? I know it's uncomfortable, but maintaining this guise is to lessen the suspicion and wariness you all might incur.\"In response to Yuder's question, the bandit leader calmly retorted. He certainly had a way with words.\"If you're so thoughtful, why not tell us your name?\"\"You're asking that now?\"He had been wondering when the question would come. With a mumble, the man's gaze landed on Yuder's face.\"Nahan.\"Whether it was his real name or an alias, Yuder didn't know. However, he decided to include it in the report he would send to Kisiar.They continued to walk into the depths of the village, where no one was in sight. Upon arrival, it was more than a simple village; compared to the size of the actual territory, the area inhabited by people was quite small.As they passed the charred windmill, drawing closer to the castle, the smell of burning became more intense. The road was littered with black ash and burnt fields not yet cleared away.\"With damage this severe... I imagine there were many casualties.\"\"There were hardly any, besides the lord and his wife who died in the castle. Especially outside the castle, there were none.\"Grasping Gakane's muttering, Nahan promptly responded, which earned him a suspicious look from Jimmy.\"How do you know that so well?\"\"Using this ability, it's not difficult to enter the castle and hear the stories firsthand.\"With an ability to overlay the exact face of someone else as an illusion, it would have been easy for him to blend in among the castle's servants. Yuder began to surmise how Nahan had obtained his information.'In other words, despite having such an ability, he couldn't find the whereabouts of his missing comrade and Devran.'Why did a noble need to keep such a secret while handling a few commoner prisoners? It was a strange thing. Yuder felt as if he understood why the man was so invested in this. Even he, Yuder, would have done the same. Yuder lifted his head towards the lost-in-thought Nahan.\"How long can you maintain your ability?\"\"I'd like to say it's a secret... but it's not as short as you might worry. It can last a few days as long as I don't exhaust myself.\"Upon hearing the word \"days,\" Gakane's expression turned odd. He too could maintain his shadow clone for as long as he wished. However, illusions were more complicated to manage than clones. It felt strange to verify that a man who used to be a bandit possessed such extraordinary skills.\"Who goes there!\"Just as Yuder was about to ask Nahan something else, someone shouted with a full measure of wariness.In the darkness, a few men dressed in guard uniforms with black cloaks for formal occasions staggered forward. They approached with their hands on the hilts of their swords, but stopped in surprise upon seeing the uniforms worn by Yuder and his party.\"That uniform... could it be...?\"\"Heng, shut up! Who are you?\"The one who yelled at the young guard, whose surprised expression couldn't be hidden, was an elderly man with a white beard. Observing the shield-shaped badge on his chest and his more luxurious attire compared to those around him, Yuder stepped forward and introduced himself.\"We come from the capital under the orders of His Excellency, Duke Peletta. I'm Yuder Aile, affiliated with the Cavalry. Might you be the captain of the Hartan guard?\"Upon hearing about the capital and Duke Peletta, the faces of the guards stiffened in unison.\"Indeed, I am Eclen Bukan, the captain of the guards. If you come on the Duke's orders, have you come to meet our Lord?\"Despite hearing that they were sent by the duke, the guard captain questioned them sharply, his demeanor not softening at all.\"Yes. But we were told at the entrance that, unfortunately, your Lord has passed away. We offer our condolences.\"Though Yuder's voice was cool and emotionless, the courtesy he displayed was impeccable. After serving as the Cavalry commander for so long, this level of etiquette had become as natural to him as breathing.\"Spare the pointless talk. What's your business here?\"\"We were told that Zakail is currently in charge. We would like to meet him.\"\"He's currently busy. If you wait in the castle, I'll inform Zakail and ask him to come see you.\"\"Understood.\"\"Heng! Escort them to the castle. The steward will guide them once they're there.\"Seeming to find the mere act of conversation displeasing, the captain of the guards turned away abruptly, raising his voice towards a young guard. The guard, with a reluctant expression, mumbled a few words in an unintelligible dialect and made a vague hand gesture towards Yuder.\"Follow me.\"Their ill-treatment continued even after they arrived at the castle. The elderly steward, after hearing the situation from the young guard, alternated his gaze between the scorched castle gate and Yuder's face, before eventually clicking his tongue as if to signal they should enter. He led them to a worn-out, dark room with no place to sit.\"Please wait here.\"\"Just a moment. Here, really?\"Gakane, who had quietly followed all this while, finally voiced his disapproval. It felt too unreasonable to be asked to wait indefinitely in a room that looked more like a storage, especially at this late hour.\"It's the only place that's not damaged and still decent. I'm really sorry we couldn't provide a better place for visitors who came from far away.\"\"...\"Leaving behind an apology that didn't seem sincere at all, the steward quickly shut the door and disappeared, leaving behind only a small lantern.\"What is this all about? Such blatant disregard. No one even mentioned Devran first, despite seeing us.\"\"The guard who escorted us was openly abusive.\"\"Abusive? When?\"\"You wouldn't have noticed because it's an Eastern dialect.\"As Jimmy replied with a defeated look, Gakane let out a short, bitter laugh.\"So, is all this related to Devran's disappearance... Yuder, are we really going to wait here quietly?\"\"For now.\"Yuder quietly responded while examining the room. The damp, dark room was filled with the stench of rotting old boxes and not even a single surviving lamp. There was a small window which barely allowed air in, but that was all.\"Well... Standing around will only tire us. Let's sit and wait.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGakane had summoned his shadow clone to sift through the stacked boxes, spreading the cleaner ones on the ground. Once he had arranged some of the boxes to serve as makeshift chairs and a bed, everyone sat down. Then, Nahan started a conversation with Gakane.\"You have a unique ability. Can your shadow pass through walls?\"\"Why do you want to know?\"Though Gakane had always seemed friendly, his reluctance to let down his guard in front of Nahan suggested he was selective in displaying his social skills.After that, an uncomfortable silence lingered, filled only with the anticipation of waiting. Perhaps growing weary of waiting in the late hour, Jimmy began to doze off, leaning against the wall.By the time the flickering candle inside the lantern had melted down by half, murmuring voices echoed from outside the window. It seemed the villagers who had gone to the back mountain had returned.\"Ah, um... it seems everyone is back...? They'll call us soon, right?\"Jimmy, who had been shaking his head as he fought sleep, perked up his ears and opened his eyes at the sound. Yuder, watching the young boy struggle valiantly against his sleepiness and anxiety, gently tapped his round head.\"If you're sleepy, just lay down and sleep.\"\"No, I'm not sleepy. I didn't sleep!\"Startled by Yuder's touch, Jimmy made his excuse, his face becoming a vivid red even in the dim light. Of course, no one believed him.Given the excessive hospitality they had received, the likelihood of the deceased Lord's son calling them right away was fifty-fifty. If nothing was amiss, they would be summoned promptly, but if not, who knew what might happen.'We'll find out soon enough.'The murmuring voices echoed from the castle entrance for quite a while, and the inside was also rather noisy. However, no sound of someone coming to call them was heard. Even as darkness gave way to the approaching dawn, the situation remained the same.Eventually, when the sun had fully risen, Yuder rose from his spot and turned the ring handle on the door.Creak. Creak-creak. No matter how many times he turned and pushed, the door refused to open outward.\"It's now clear.\"Yuder's voice resonated low in the stuffy room.\"It seems they have no intention of meeting us.\"\"This is truly ridiculous.\"Gakane sneered, his eyes showing signs of fatigue.\"So, what's the plan now?\"If asked, Gakane could immediately summon his shadow clone to break down the door. Jimmy was also a boy who, despite his rusty practice sword, could slice through walls like the legendary sword masters in the tales.\"Just say the word. It'll be quick to break down and get out.\"But contrary to Gakane's thoughts, Yuder did not immediately try to break down the door. Lost in thought for a moment, he moved to the window and began to whistle in a peculiar pattern.After repeating the distinctive whistle three times, something flew from afar into the small window. Perched on Yuder's outstretched finger like a torch was undoubtedly the messenger bird he had kept at his saddle side until yesterday.\"...A messenger bird?\"\"Let's send a report first, then move.\"His soft voice drew attention. Gakane watched as Yuder drew a small piece of paper from his pocket. Just as he wondered how Yuder planned to write without a pen, Yuder lifted a finger and brought it close to the paper.Moments later, a minuscule flame flowed forth, outlining delicate shapes akin to script, gently searing the surface of the paper. While he had turned his body to prevent others from seeing what he was writing, everyone could recognize the incredible precision involved in his ability, an application so intricate it was scarcely believable even to those watching.Many besides Yuder could wield the power of flame, but none were capable of utilizing it in such a way, with such control. This level of fine-tuning was even more challenging than summoning a flame large enough to blanket an entire mountain.Watching the astonishment, not entirely concealed, in the eyes of the bandit leader who had introduced himself as Nahan, Gakane felt a covert sense of superiority.After awakening their abilities, these individuals had lived out their lives in arrogance. However, once they joined the Cavalry, they experienced a profound sense of defeat in the face of Yuder's overwhelming skill.Even though Kishiar, the Commander, was the one who had created the Cavalry, it was largely thanks to Yuder that they had learned humility and unified through effort. Regardless of how exceptional the bandit leader's abilities were, Gakane was sure he would be no exception. Feeling this, his nerves, which had been on edge ever since his arrival, began to regain a sense of calm.Yuder, who had seemingly premeditated his words, swiftly crafted the letter. He then rolled up the paper and placed it in a small pouch attached to the leg of the messenger bird. As he approached the window and reached out his hand, the bird gave a low cry, unfurled its wings, and flew away.\"We're done here. Now... let's go.\"Yuder, having turned his body around, fixed his intense gaze on the closed door. His eyes bore a coldness that made one feel as if they were experiencing winter.\"Sir, Sir Zakail! Sir Zakail!\"A few days ago, the youngest son of Lord Hartan, Zakail Hartan, who had unexpectedly passed away, had been incredibly tired from attending the funeral till late into the night.However, the hand shaking him awake, despite having been commanded not to disturb him, was insistently rough, as if it couldn't care less about his state.\"Sir Zakail! Please wake up. Master Zakail!\"\"What is it?\"\"They... they're here.\"\"...\"The tremor in the voice, laden with loathing and fear, was unnaturally intense. Zakail felt sleep abandon him instantly, his heavy eyelids snapping open as he reluctantly sat up.\"Who are you talking about?\"\"Well, last night, some uninvited guests showed up, and the steward locked them in the storage house. Those bastards just broke the door down a moment ago and are causing a ruckus demanding to see you...!\"Zakail harshly slapped the servant, who was babbling on nervously.\"Ouch.\"\"Didn't I make it clear yesterday? I am no longer a young master. Soon, I'll be a lord! Make sure to use the correct title!\"The events of last night hadn't just entailed Zakail performing the last rites for his deceased relatives. He had shown those who had been mocking him as an unworthy shell of a noble since birth what he was truly made of and had succeeded in carving his own destiny.'Of course, my elder brother is still around, but he'll leave soon.'If his brother hadn't foolishly disclosed his plans of leaving everything behind for a commoner woman, Zakail might not have achieved the victory he was relishing now.The raucous bunch had all been cleared away, and he had just been considering finally getting some well-deserved rest when the servant woke him up, still using the old honorifics. It didn't sit well with Zakail.As Zakail stared down at the servant, trembling from the smack on the cheek, and pondered his fate, the door abruptly swung open again.\"Master Zakail.\"Simply from the sound of the voice, Zakail knew it was the old attendant's son. He pressed his throbbing head and spoke sharply.\"Leave. I will rest some more. Did I not say not to disturb me while I'm sleeping?\"\"It's not that, Master Zakail. The thing is...\"\"Out of the way.\"A strange voice interjected, pushing aside the attendant's son. Thereafter, several sets of footsteps neatly filed into his room.\"Are you Zakail Hartan?\"\"\u2026Who are you?\"He tried not to show fear, but Zakail involuntarily felt a chill. The aura emitted by those who stood before him was excessively cold and sinister. The man with black hair standing at the forefront made his spine tingle just by his gaze.\"I thought you would recognize us immediately by our uniforms, a shame.\"Yuder, standing before Zakail, could easily sense all the emotions he was experiencing. Every servant he had encountered on his way here, since breaking through the door, wore the same expression.It puzzled him why people always acted defensively even to those who approached them with respect. He'd experienced this many times in his past life, and it was no different now.\"We are Cavalry members from the capital under the command of Duke Peletta. We came to see you, Zakail, on behalf of your late father, but there seems to be some misunderstanding...\"As Yuder trailed off and looked around, the servants meeting his gaze quickly retreated, which caused a slight smirk to tug at the corners of his mouth.\"Despite waiting all night, no one came to see us. We couldn't wait any longer in a room without a chair, so we took the liberty of coming here first. Is now a good time?\"\u201cThis\u2026\u201dZakail's furious gaze was pinned on the servants peering in from outside the door. However, he quickly calmed himself, biting his lip and standing up. The young and ambitious nobleman didn't forget that the first thing he needed to maintain in this situation was his dignity.\"So...that's how it is. Everyone was in a state of chaos due to the fire incident a few days ago, causing the death of my father and brother. I too fell asleep from exhaustion as soon as I returned at dawn... I apologize for being discourteous to our guests. I hope you will understand. Could you please wait in the drawing-room for a while? I will get ready and join you shortly.\"Zakail was still in his sleepwear, having just woken up and not even washed his face. It was embarrassing to be seen by others in this state. He clenched his teeth and tolerated his shame. The man with black hair, who looked at him indifferently, gave a small nod a moment later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Understood. But I fear I can't wait for long. I am simply famished.\"\"Attendant! Guide our guests to the reception room and arrange some food for them. Quick!\"Zakail barked nervously. Barely poking his head out from the door, the elderly attendant scrambled to respond, \"Yes, sir!\" Zakail watched the rabble depart, then swiftly washed his face and changed his clothes.He thought the world would be his once the funeral was over, but what on earth was happening on the very first day? An icy premonition slithered down Zakail's spine. He shivered and lowered his head.'No. If I think I'm unlucky, that's exactly what will happen. I must stay positive.'Hadn't they said they were the Cavalry members sent by the Duke of Peletta? Then, their purpose of visit was clear. Hadn't they also mentioned that such people would be coming soon?Everything was already in place. It was just that their arrival was slightly, very slightly, earlier than expected.Taking a deep breath, Zakail stepped into the reception room. While he had been preparing himself, the uninvited guests were comfortably seated in the high-quality chairs that hadn't been burned, nonchalantly clearing the dishes.\"Yuder, you should try this. It's my first time eating it, but it's pretty good.\"\"That's right. It's a special dish from the east called Koakat. They say it's delicious when added to stew.\"The speed at which they were eating was astonishing. No matter how hastily the cook served the dishes, they disappeared in the blink of an eye. The sight was dizzying. Zakail managed to cough loudly, drawing the attention of the unwelcome guests.\"It appears... the food suits your taste. That's a relief.\"\"Yes, thanks to you.\"Yuder, who had been waiting for Zakail, replied leisurely. His demeanor was as if he were the host, which caused Zakail's eyes to twitch involuntarily.\"Now that you have had your fill... we should discuss the matters at hand.\"\"Ah, I wanted to, but there's a new dish out. Let's finish this first.\"Yuder gestured towards the cook, who had brought out a new dish at the perfect moment.The cook, who was unsure of what to do in the presence of Zakail, carefully set the new dish on the table. Immediately, Jimmy and Gakane lunged at it with their forks. Nahan also coolly managed to snatch a large piece of meat from the dish and quickly devoured it.Seeing them disregard etiquette and eagerly devour the food as he had requested, Yuder felt a great sense of satisfaction.The more pride these people had in their noble status, the more they struggled with this behavior. They weren't accustomed to holding back their disdain when faced with something displeasing.\"This is delicious. It's superbly grilled with sauce. I think I might fall in love with eastern cuisine. Yuder, are you sure you don't want any more?\"Gakane, whose mannerisms would never have suggested his noble birth, chewed his grilled vegetables with relish and presented a piece of the meat dish to Yuder with his fork.\"Here, ah.\"\"Oh, dear...\"The servants' faces changed at the incredibly embarrassing act that not even commoners would perform in front of others. Their roles had clearly been reversed.'Gakane. He's rather good at this.'He knew his nobles well, and it showed in this instance too. Yuder internally admired Gakane's newfound talent and resolved to match his pace.Gakane flashed a happy smile as he accepted the meat that was offered to him. The strikingly handsome man, radiant as a rose, warmed the surrounding air with his genuine smile.\"Is it good?\"\"Mmm.\"\"Yuder! Try mine too! You must taste this!\"Yuder accepted a bite of the dish that Jimmy offered. He was actually quite full, but he couldn't refuse if it meant causing more discomfort to the humans before him.The newly prepared dishes presented by the chef were quickly devoured.\"Now... may we clear the table and discuss?\"Zakail, who had been sitting at a distance as if reluctant to join, finally spoke with a sour face. Yuder, seeing the distaste evident on Zakail's face as he struggled to speak, nodded.\"Of course.\"While the table was being cleared, Yuder briefly explained his name and his reasons for being there to Zakail. Upon hearing that Yuder had come in search of Devran Hartude, Zakail bit his lip and nodded.\"Devran Hartude... yes. Someone by that name came by not long ago. I remember him.\"\"That will expedite matters. Where is Devran now?\"\"He's dead.\"\"Excuse me?\"The one who questioned was not Yuder. Gakane, wearing a fierce expression, glared at Zakail.\"What are you talking about? Devran is dead?\"\"Precisely. Do you know that he was trying to burn down our peaceful Hartan?\"\"I heard about it on my way here. But Devran isn't like that. Why would he want to burn down his precious hometown, where his family lives?\"\"I don't know either. I was running errands for my father in another village at the time. So all I know is what I heard after I returned to the village after the fire.\"After saying this, Zakail cast his eyes downward. He appeared to be carefully choosing his words.\"He killed his family himself, ran to this castle, and caused a big fire. My sick father couldn't escape in time, and my sister and brother-in-law who tried to save him also suffered. My older brother is a knight and couldn't come immediately, but after the funeral yesterday, he had to leave urgently. He said he'll be back in a few days.\"He stopped speaking and displayed a mournful face. To anyone watching, he was a noble young man distraught from losing his family.\"As the youngest son who never properly learned about the family affairs, what can I do alone? The best I could do was gather the townspeople and finish the funeral. I planned to discuss the matter with my brother when he returns and send a report to the capital... I never imagined you would come looking for us this soon.\"\"I understand the situation. But you haven't explained why Devran is dead.\"At Yuder's calm response, Zakail furrowed his brows.\"You still haven't guessed? He took his own life yesterday. It seems he gave up after being sentenced to death and died right away in jail. Although he was a condemned prisoner, since he was under Duke Peletta's command, we were planning to report first and then carry out the execution...... This turn of events has given me a headache.\"There were no loopholes in Zakail's explanation. Everything seemed to make sense.'Except, of course, for the gaping hole of why Devran would kill his family and start a fire....'Yuder's gaze bored into Zakail's weary face, as if trying to read the hidden intentions behind his words.\"Understood. So, after your elder brother returns and takes his place as the lord, reports and follow-up procedures will officially start, is that right?\"\"No, not exactly.\"At Yuder's question, Zakail shook his head.\"It's true we plan to discuss and proceed with the reporting and follow-up after my brother's return, but as for the lordship... I will likely be the one to take that position.\"Zakail paused for a moment after saying that.\"My brother already has a place in the Silver Cross Knights. Despite his young age, he has outstanding skills and has already ascended to the position of deputy commander. It's said that in a few years, he'll become the commander and receive the title of viscount. Given this position, becoming the lord of such a small territory would rather be a shackle to him.\"\"Your brother seems remarkable.\"\"Indeed. Since he was young, his dream has been to leave this small, boring place and become an outstanding knight. So, the one left behind will be me, someone very... different from him.\"For the first time, Zakail relaxed his furrowed brow and smiled. Yuder read jealousy and admiration in his eyes.'Jealousy....'Zakail Hartan, the youngest son of the former lord. According to eastern customs, he was in a position of a youngest child who had nothing to inherit but the nobility status. However, due to the fire incident a few days ago, he had suddenly come into the position of the lord.The only person who had benefited from the entire series of incidents was Zakail Hartan.Was this all a coincidence?'No.'Yuder was confident based on his experiences. It couldn't be. The man before his eyes was hiding something, and undoubtedly, within that, there was the clue to Devran's whereabouts.'But he won't easily spill the beans. I need to observe and wait a bit longer.'After organizing his thoughts, Yuder slightly bowed his head towards Zakail.\"I understand your situation. However, as we're here on the order of Duke Peletta, it's difficult for us to return immediately. We'd like to continue our investigation and report back to the Duke. Would that be acceptable?\"Yuder intentionally used the title of 'Duke' rather than 'Captain'. Whether it had the desired effect or not, a troubled expression briefly crossed Zakail's face.Regardless of how low the emperor and his brother, Duke Peletta's, prestige was in the east, their noble status was recognized by everyone. A minor noble like Zakail would inevitably feel small in front of a noble of higher rank. It was one of the lessons about the psychology of nobles that Yuder had learned in his previous life.\"...Do as you wish. I'll instruct the townspeople to cooperate.\"\"I appreciate your understanding. Then we'll stay here for a while.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHaving obtained the answer he wanted, Yuder escorted the three who had eaten their fill to a proper guest room, a stark contrast from their previous accommodations.\"They claimed that everything else was completely burnt down, and only that storage-like room was left. But that was a total lie.\"\"I know, right? There's not even a hint of smoke and everything seems to be in perfect condition!\"Listening to the outraged voices of Gakane and Jimmy, Yuder turned towards the window. From his vantage point, he had an overview of most of the Hartan territory.The small fiefdom, which should have been charming and peaceful, bore stark, black scars under the sunlight, revealing the cruelty it had suffered.'Weren't they saying there were hardly any casualties?'Nahan had indeed said so, but seeing the village filled with the remnants of a fire caused him to doubt this information.'Of course, of the people I've met here, the most suspicious one is Zakail Hartan.'Yuder turned his back to the window and recalled the conversation he'd just had with Zakail Hartan. Even though Zakail had reluctantly agreed upon hearing Kishiar's name, he hadn't hesitated much in accepting Yuder's request.If there had been anything to worry about, it would have been that an outsider from the capital was so willing to pry into the affairs of the village. Zakail didn't respond as easily to that. Considering Zakail's demeanour, he seemed too proud and not very good at hiding his emotions, which only increased Yuder's suspicions.Hadn't he purposely disrupted Zakail's composure to take a peek at his intentions, asking his companions to show their lack of manners during the meal?Despite all this, if Zakail still behaved as such, there could only be one plausible answer: Zakail was confident that no matter what Yuder and his Cavalry did, they would not discover his secret.However, not everything in the world goes as planned. Yuder, recalling the messenger pigeon that would have reached the capital by now, formulated his next plan.------\"Haha. This is the first time I've heard such nagging since the Emperor's passing. Seems like I must not have gained much trust.\"\"...Who are you referring to?\"\"Who do you think?\"Kishiar waved the letter in his hand with a slow, elegant smile. His adjutant, Nathan Zuckerman, squinted at the letter with a frown.\"My assistant.\"The moment Kishiar woke up from his morning nap, he had been greeted by the messenger pigeon.The little bird that flew from Hartan was honoured to drink water directly from the Duke after delivering the letter. The pigeon, currently perched on a small statue on the desk and preening its feathers, looked extremely comfortable and content.\"What has he written to make you say such things?\"\"Curious, are you?\"\u201cWhy not take a look for yourself? Especially you, Nathan, I'll let you see.\u201d Handing the letter to his adjutant with a light voice, Kishiar watched as Nathan scrutinized the brown characters that filled the small sheet of paper, furrowing his brows slightly.\"The ink color is unusual.\"\"It's not ink.\"\"Excuse me?\"\"Take a closer look. It's not written, it's been lightly burned onto the paper. Quite a skill, don't you think?\"Indeed, it was as Kishiar had said. Nathan rubbed the characters with his finger, noticing they didn't smudge at all, and realized his lord was correct. The technique was incredible and almost unbelievable.\"His rate of improvement is beyond monstrous.\"Nathan Zuckerman had reached the pinnacle of Sword Mastery at a very young age. It was a lofty position only those who boasted they could accomplish anything with a sword could reach.However, even he found it difficult to accurately write a letter on a piece of palm-sized paper with the tip of his sword. The challenge was not just about strength but the ability to delicately divide and control that power.And Yuder Aile accomplished such a feat with ease. His control was terrifying enough to send shivers down the spine of anyone who knew he was an ally.Dodging the gaze of his lord who seemed to have no sense of caution and was just smiling, Nathan cast his eyes once more on the letter. Although the script was small, it wasn't unreadable.A moment later, Nathan, who had been rapidly scanning the letter, looked up with a puzzled expression.\"Lord Hartan and the heir are already dead, and the member we need to save is imprisoned, facing execution for setting fire to a village... and on their way there, they've encountered a bandit group composed of Awakeners... shouldn't you send more people?\"\"He said he doesn't need them.\"Kishiar's answer was clear-cut.\"Despite all these troubles, he is confident that he can resolve everything within three days, so he doesn't need extra people. I can't do anything if he tells me to focus on investigating the Red Stone here and not to forget about it.\"\"...He didn't write it that rudely, though.\"If one took out all the courtesies that could be found in a book teaching the basics of letter writing and summarized, that was roughly the message in the latter half of the letter.\"Even if the missing member is still alive, how can they possibly rescue a prisoner facing execution? Shouldn't I go there myself at this point?\"\"If he felt the situation was urgent, he wouldn't have said that. He would have asked to smash everything first and then requested us to clean up afterward. Or he would have retreated and contacted us from somewhere else.\"Kishiar replied leisurely, as if he could read the writer's thoughts.\"But judging by the fact that he chose to accompany the bandit leader he met there and even sent the name, it's clear that Yuder Aile thinks this person is extraordinary. I think it's a pseudonym though... what do you think?\"\"If it's a pseudonym, it's possible he's from the same country as me.\"There was a strange certainty in Nathan's words.\"Yes. The name, after all, means 'revenge' in the language of the Southern Kingdom. It seems like there's an intention there.\"The empire knew little about the Southern Kingdom, which was separated from it by a desert. However, Nathan, who was from the South, and Kishiar, who had been with him for a long time, knew more about the language and culture of the South than others did.The Southern Kingdom had a language and culture system completely different from the surrounding countries, including the empire. As a result, their naming conventions were also significantly different.A brief smile of interest flickered across Kishiar's beautiful face before disappearing.\"In any case, investigate the bandit group. And find out more about Zakail Hartan, the youngest son of Lord Hartan, who has currently assumed full authority. And...\"As Kishiar casually piled on additional tasks, his red eyes lost their smile and became calm for the first time.\"If there's no further contact after three days, Nathan, you take the seal and proceed as planned.\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"Even though one can quickly clear the garbage piled in front of them, no one knows what kind of mess might unfold beneath it.\"As Nathan lowered his head, Kishiar's expression once again transformed into its usual ease.\"What about the mages? Didn't they say they needed help?\"\"So far, no. They spent the entire day writing and observing from a distance.\"Kishiar had personally moved the Red Stone into the building's basement yesterday to facilitate the mages' investigations.It was a huge, open space, making it easy to maintain a distance from the Red Stone's power, and also convenient to store necessary items. As no one knew there was space beneath the lodging building, there could be no better place for investigation.Having listened to Nathan's report, Kishiar nodded, leaning deeply back into his chair.\"Good. Caution is a virtue. And the members?\"\"As usual, they're dedicated to their training. There's nothing in particular for you to worry about.\"\"I see. Keep observing.\"Kishiar, having ended the conversation, smoothly extended his hand.\"Give back that report.\"Having most likely memorized it upon reading, he must have something more to examine. Kishiar began to look over the retrieved paper again. To avoid disturbing his lord, Nathan silently retreated.The blunt but loyal adjutant's gaze shifted over a scripture being meticulously organized, then out to the sky through the window.------\"Oh, well, I really don't know.\"\"The fire was such a huge event, I can hardly remember what happened that day.\"\"I don't know. I was... I was too preoccupied with protecting my family.\"After obtaining Zakail's permission, Yuder ventured outside the castle to explore the surroundings. All the townspeople he encountered were on their guard, nervously retreating at his approach. Whenever he managed to corner someone and ask about the day of the fire, their answers were all the same: they couldn't remember or they didn't know.\"It's like we've become a plague to them, avoiding us at all costs. People are so suspicious.\"Gakane muttered a self-deprecating comment as he looked around the deserted surroundings. The townspeople's suspicion was so profound that even his handsome face and amiable manner failed to break through.People turned and ran as if they had seen a monster, creating a line of people fleeing from him. It must have been an experience that Gakane Bolunwald had encountered only a few times in his life.\"It wasn't always like this, was it?\"Yuder quietly asked Nahan, who was following them. Nahan offered a faint smile and a nonchalant shrug.\"Of course not to this extent. It seems the lord must have issued some directive.\"\"What should we do? If people keep refusing to answer and avoiding us...\"Yuder turned his gaze to Jimmy, who looked worried as he surveyed the surroundings. Perhaps because he hadn't slept well and had been exposed to the morning chill while wandering around, the boy's cheeks seemed a bit more flushed than usual.Noticing that, Yuder lightly touched Jimmy's forehead with the back of his hand.\"Uh, Yuder? Why are you doing that?\"\"You seem to have a bit of a fever.\"\"Fever?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTo call it a misconception would have been incorrect; there was indeed a slight feverish warmth to Jimmy. Perhaps recalling what Yuder had mentioned before they arrived here, Gakane quickly approached and clutched both of Jimmy's cheeks.\"Ugh, what's going on?\"After a moment, he subtly nodded his head towards Yuder, casting a secretive glance. It meant that there were no signs of him manifesting his secondary gender yet.\"...It does seem like you have a fever, just like Yuder said. Jimmy, you should have told us if you weren't feeling well.\"\"I didn't because I feel fine! I'm really okay. This is nothing. You're not planning on sending me back first, are you?\"Jimmy shook his head vigorously and sent pleading looks at Yuder, but Yuder didn't flinch.Even if it was just a mild fever due to fatigue and overwork, it shouldn't be taken lightly. After all, wasn't it Yuder who was in charge of their party?\"Gakane. Take Jimmy and return to the castle.\"\"Me? Then what about you\u2026\"Yuder decided to send Gakane along, seeing as the boy wouldn't go back if left alone. Gakane's gaze quickly shifted between Yuder and Nahan behind him.\"Do you think it'll be okay with just the two of you?\"\"If anything happens, I'm not the one who should be worried, they should be.\"\"That may be true, but...\"Gakane let out a sigh, and after a moment, he opened his mouth while glaring at Nahan.\"Anyway, if you need me, send a signal of fire towards the castle. Even though my body will be there, I can send my shadow clone a considerable distance.\"\"Understood.\"Yuder remembered seeing the entirety of the territory from the guest room window they were to stay in and nodded lightly. Even though it seemed unlikely that Gakane would need to send his shadow clone, showing precaution wasn't a bad thing.\"You two are about to share a bed, and yet you're acting so stiff.\"\"Sleeping? Who? With you?\"At Nahan's words, Gakane questioned back in astonishment.\"There are only two rooms available, so someone will have to share with me, right?\"\"...\"Gakane's eyelashes trembled a little, as if he hadn't considered that.\"In that case... I would rather\u2026\"\"Let's discuss this later, we need to move first.\"Yuder raised his hand to stop the pointless conversation from continuing.\"That kind of talk? This is important too, Yuder!\"\"Jimmy's health is more important than that.\"\"I am really fine, brother. Please believe me!\"Jimmy, who had been standing with a gloomy face, jumped into the conversation without missing a beat.\"Jimmy.\"After taking a brief look at Nahan, Yuder leaned down towards Jimmy and whispered near his ear.\"I've heard that you've had a slight fever for some time now. Your condition may have worsened due to fatigue, so rest today.\"\"Who, who said that?\"\"The Commander.\"As soon as Kishiar's name was mentioned, Jimmy's stubbornness immediately faltered. It seemed that he too felt something was off.\"I understand\u2026\u2026 I'll go.\"\"Rest well today, and if you seem perfectly fine tomorrow, I'll continue to give you tasks even if you refuse.\"\"...Really?\"At Yuder's words, Jimmy's head shot up. Yuder looked at the boy's face, which had begun to light up again, and firmly nodded.\"It would be a loss for me not to utilize the labor I've brought with me.\"\"Hehe. Fine! Then I'm going straight to sleep. I'm really drowsy, you know.\"Looking at the now-brightened Jimmy, Yuder gestured to Gakane to come closer.\"Even if you don't feel any signs yet, if you think it might manifest, lay Jimmy down on the bed and move directly to the next room. Then, call me through your shadow clone.\"\"Got it. Anything else?\"\"When you isolate him, lock the door to Jimmy's room. And....\"Yuder glanced at Hartan Castle in the distance. Zakail Hartan should have been watching what they were doing by then.\"Keep an eye on Zakail Hartan's movements within the castle. If he moves anywhere, call me then as well.\"\"So you want me to monitor that guy? Fine. I was suspecting him too.\"Gakane seemed to have noticed the suspicious demeanor of Zakail that Yuder had caught onto. After Gakane and Jimmy returned to the castle, Yuder shifted his gaze to Nahan.\"So we're left alone. What's your next plan? Are you going to continue searching for the villagers as before?\"\"No.\"He had searched for everyone he needed to. But since no one was willing to give information, he was thinking of another approach.\"I'll look for someone who has no choice but to speak.\"\"A person who has no choice but to speak.\"Nahan's eyes shone with interest.\"Who might that be?\"Instead of answering, Yuder silently pointed at a place. Many people were struggling to clean up a blacksmith shop that had been burned down. Among them were a good number of guards who had been dispatched to maintain the village's security.\"Guards? They wouldn't be much help either, would they?\"\"They would at least know the exact location of the house or grave of the comrade I was looking for.\"In such a small village, a guard was akin to an official handyman, dealing with all sorts of chores.Given that they moved according to the Lord's orders, it would have been impossible for them not to have heard Zakail Hartan's 'Please cooperate' message like the others.Yuder approached a young guard who had just arrived near a deserted road, struggling to pull a cart full of the burnt bricks.Sensing a stranger, the guard's gaze darted toward Yuder before quickly looking away as though he had seen something he wasn't supposed to see. Whether he acted like this or not, Yuder had already decided to target him.\"I'd like to ask you a question.\"\"Can't you see I'm busy right now? Please move along.\"The voice seemed familiar, and indeed it was the same guard who had led them to the castle the previous night.\"We have come with permission from Zakail himself, who said we could ask anyone...\"\"What does that have to do with anything?\"The guard, tired from hauling bricks, flared up in irritation.\"I never heard such a thing, and I'm extremely busy right now. Go ask other people. That should work, shouldn't it?\"\"Understood. I thought that the guards, of all people, would know since this is the future Lord's order, but if you say so... well... it's nice to see the free atmosphere of the Hartan guards. Very impressive.\"The young guard's eyes widened as if feeling the sting in Yuder's words.\"Ah. By the way, it's not a big deal, but may I know your name?\"\"...Are you, are you threatening me?\"The young guardsman's eyebrows twitched violently.\"Of course not. I was just curious. Considering we had a connection last night, I thought Zakail might enjoy hearing about you.\"\"....\"The young guardsman glanced behind him. There was no one in the busy crowd of villagers paying him any attention. Putting down his cart, he opened his mouth with an angry expression.\"Darn it. What are you trying to ask?\"The fish had finally bitten the bait. Yuder showed him behind a large tree with a cold smile. It was a spot big enough to hide about three people.\"It'll only take a moment. Follow me.\"They moved behind the tree. Luckily, the large tree, seemingly centuries old, was untouched by the fire.\"Do you know Devran?\"The moment they were all under the shade of the tree, Yuder quickly asked in a low voice. The young guardsman frowned as if he had expected that question.\"...I know him. But I don't know much about what happened that day.\"\"That's okay. What kind of person was Devran?\"\"What kind of person was he?\"\"Since you grew up in the same village, I thought you might know him better than we do.\"\"Just a... regular... guy.\"The guardsman looked uncomfortably at the ground.\"You seem about the same age, I guess you played together when you were kids.\"Recalling the age of Devran Hartude, which he had heard before coming here, Yuder asked. For the first time, the young guardsman's eyes briefly fluttered. He seemed about to respond, but ended up shutting his mouth.\"...\"\"What was Devran's family composition?\"Instead of pressing him for an answer, Yuder moved on to the next question.\"Only his father and a younger sister.\"\"Good. Can you tell me where Devran's house is?\"\"That's....\"The young guardsman lifted his head. Yuder followed his gaze, turning around. Behind a few burnt and ragged houses, there was one ruin, particularly charred and untouched. It was the size of a small house.\"That's it. Just to let you know in advance, there's nothing left because it all burned.\"\"...I see.\"His words seemed to be discouraging, but of course, Yuder had no intention of heeding them. He took note of where the ruin was and then opened his mouth again.\"Were the deceased family members of Devran in there at the time?\"\"They said so, so it must be true!\"\"So, they wouldn't have created separate graves.\"The guardsman fell silent for the second time. He gritted his teeth anxiously and finally forced his mouth open.\"Hey, how long are you going to question me? I told you I'm busy.\"\"Don't worry, this is the last question.\"Yuder looked straight ahead.\"Can you tell me how the bodies of convicts are dealt with in Hartan?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Why...?\"\"Surely you don't expect a guard to be unaware of that.\"There was a hint of hesitation and a great deal of doubt in the eyes of the young guard who had met his gaze squarely. However, Yuder did not clarify the intent of his question.\"Incredible. He is the kind of person who couldn\u2019t help but tell everything.\"After the young guard had given all the answers and hastily left, Nahan, who had been watching him from a step behind all this time, approached Yuder.\"Did you recognize that man as the guard we met last night and targeted him?\"\"No.\"However, as a result, the intimidation had been even more effective, which was fortunate. Following Yuder, who walked decisively towards the house where Devran had lived, Nahan continued the conversation.\"I never imagined he would take the threat of revealing his name to Zakail so seriously. Why, though? Even if you told Zakail, he would likely not care, as long as things were going as he wished.\"\"Just because the one at the top doesn't care doesn't mean those below feel the same way.\"As an example, he referred to the remarkably stern and intimidating old guard captain.\"...I see.\"Nahan's eyes shone oddly, quickly grasping the meaning behind the words.\"So lower-ranking individuals dislike even being mentioned, for fear it could offend those above them. Hmm. How did you know such a subtle detail? Were you perhaps a member of the imperial army?\"\"Do I have to answer that as well?\"Yuder quietly retorted, implying that the one losing out wasn't him but Nahan. At this, Nahan gave a low chuckle.\"I'm a bit too curious, you see. Especially when I meet a competent brother like you.\"\"I would've thought I told you there were no brothers like you.\"\"Your coldness is almost at the level of a glacier's breath. Surely, you could share that much.\"\"If you want to know, you should start sharing.\"Seemingly annoyed by Nahan's excessive curiosity and reluctance to share his own information first, Nahan quickly shut his mouth. Silence followed until they reached Devran's house.'Here we are.'Everything was charred black. The ruins were devastating even from afar, but the horror was more palpable up close. Yuder slowly circled around the ruins, filled with the burnt debris, and inspected it.The neighboring houses and streets they had seen on the way here were all marked by the same charred traces, but none were as severe as Devran's house. At least the others hadn't collapsed like this.As Yuder returned to his original position and looked down at the chaotic debris, Nahan stood next to him. Yuder glanced at him and then opened his mouth.\"You must have come this far as well, right?\"\"I did.\"Nahan casually agreed.\"However, I didn't discover anything beyond the conjecture that the fire here was more purposefully destructive than elsewhere.\"This was in line with what Yuder had thought. He was certain that the fire which had consumed Devran's house had been deliberately set.While the other parts of the village had been only superficially scorched, the fire that had burnt this house down seemed intent on completely annihilating everything. If not, the house wouldn't have been destroyed to such an extent that its very form was unrecognizable.\"The villagers seem to consider it ominous to even approach this place. The bodies inside must've burnt up, so it seems they plan to bury it as is.\"\"Well....\"Yuder stared towards the ruinous debris piled high, muttering about the secrets it could potentially hide within.\"Even if the outside has been burned, could the inside be the same?\"\"Hmm? Do you mean there might still be a body inside? But it would be difficult to clear these ruins on our own.\"Yuder gave a nonchalant wave of his hand, without turning to look at the puzzled Nahan. Then, a tremendous wind rose silently around the ruins of Devran's house, starting to lift the debris as one. The ground trembled minutely as if experiencing a mild earthquake, submitting to the immense power before it.A moment later, they could clearly see the bare floor of Devran's house, revealed beneath the rubble floating mid-air.\"The inside... surprisingly, it's rather intact.\"Nahan glanced back and forth between the debris and the floor, murmuring quietly.\"We might be able to find traces of a body inside.\"They looked at each other, then stepped fearlessly into the interior. The old stone floor, hardly burned by the fire, was clean.However, if two people had indeed died here, there were no signs of their bodies. No bones, no blood, nothing else was visible.\"Most of the debris seems to be furniture, dishes, and cloth from the house. Other than that... is this a shovel?\"As Nahan wandered among the floating debris, he nudged a small shovel with a burnt handle. Yuder approached what seemed to be the area where a door and a wall once stood, stepping over the charred debris.From the original shape of the floating debris above, it appeared that a bed might have been here.Then, Yuder noticed something small gleaming amidst the charred wood and cloth. What he grasped in his outstretched hand was a small, round piece of metal.Although it was difficult to recognize its original form due to the fire, it was certainly a piece of jewelry adorned with a gem.\"What's that? A brooch?\"\"It seems so.\"Yuder examined the object, rolling it in his fingers. It appeared to be an ordinary brooch, but when he put pressure on the end, the inside jingled and twisted ever so slightly. A spark of interest appeared in Yuder's eyes at this realization.'A double brooch?'Even an ordinary brooch would be a luxury for a commoner, but this one was a double brooch, designed with a hidden compartment.Yuder remembered seeing such double brooches in his previous life, often used by nobles to store miniature portraits of loved ones. They were always popular for their romantic appeal, though he himself could never quite understand it.He tried to open the brooch by applying pressure with his fingers, but due to the distortion from the fire, it didn't open easily. After several attempts, Yuder finally managed to pry it open. Inside, a small portrait revealed itself, fortunately undamaged by the fire.'This is......'Upon seeing the image, Yuder unintentionally furrowed his brow, Nahan peering into the brooch alongside him had a similar reaction.\"A knight donned in a cloak with the insignia of the Hartan family and a cross emblem. There's only one person who fits that description.\"\"...\"Zakail Hartan had said that he had a brother who was a member of the Silver Cross Knight Order.And Devran Hartude had a father and a younger sister.Yuder remembered Devran expressing concern to his fellow members that the lord might not grant his request to move their residence due to his sister.Devran and his family had disappeared, but Zakail Hartan's brother had not died. The visage of the man in the fine brooch discovered in the ruins of Devran's house. What did all this signify?Yuder closed the brooch and tucked it into his chest pocket.\"Get out. I'm going to restore it to its original state.\"\"Have we found everything we came to find?\"Quick-witted, Nahan answered and slipped out of the ruins. Yuder followed him out of the burned house, slowly released his power, and returned the remaining debris to their original places.A large amount of black dust rose with the sound of crumbling, but none of the ashes flew to Yuder, who was enveloped by the wind.\"Where are we heading next? To the back mountain as well?\"\"...Yes.\"Before they had arrived, they had heard from a young guard that the bodies of executed convicts were buried casually around a large rock in Mount Clayman, extending behind the Hartan territory.Even if he committed suicide, Devran was a convict, so his body must have been buried there.Of course, if he truly died.No bodies of people who were said to have been burned to death in the house were found, so could Devran's body really be fully discovered? He felt like he could bet it wouldn't.And his thought was confirmed when they reached Mount Clayman after about an hour's walk.'Just as I thought. Nothing.'They quickly found the large rock used to bury the bodies of the convicts. As the young guard had said, the rock had a bizarre appearance, looking like a monstrous creature standing on two legs and roaring, making it easy to identify. The guard mentioned that the townspeople called it 'The Rock of Death'.However, there were no signs around the Rock of Death that suggested something had recently been buried. Just in case, Yuder lightly manipulated the wind and earth to turn the area upside down, but all he found were a few skeletal fragments that seemed to have been buried a very long time ago.\"Over here. Can you come this way?\"Then, Nahan, who had disappeared a short distance away, called Yuder.\"There's a pit here.\"The pit that Nahan found was closer to the woods than to the area around the rock. It was narrow and deep enough to bury a person, but there was nothing inside it.\"Was it like this from the beginning?\"\"No. When I found it, the fallen leaves were... covering it like this.\"Nahan moved his feet to roughly cover the pit with the piles of leaves that had been pushed to the side. It was clear that it had been covered up hastily.Yuder pushed the leaves aside again and knelt down in front of the revealed pit. When he leaned over to look inside, a foul, damp smell wafted out.Although the scent was mixed with the strong smell of decaying leaves that had been piled up for a long time, the foul smell was extremely familiar to Yuder.Yuder reached out and randomly scooped up a handful of dirt from inside the pit. Inside his black gloves, he could see a liquid that had not completely dried out seeping out from between the crumbled soil.'Blood.'There was no doubt about it. It was blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's clear that they're gone. Looking at the circumstances, they didn't escape on their own, but who took them away?\"After finishing his speculation, similar to Yuder's, Nahan quietly turned his head to look deep into the forest. It was hard to make out footprints from the long-accumulated pile of leaves, but once he knew that someone had been here, several traces caught his eye.A young branch that looked broken as if someone had bumped into it, weeds growing in the crevices of rocks that had been stepped on, and faint brown shoe prints on a white stone. Perhaps the brown was a footprint left by stepping on blood.'Two... or maybe three.'Yuder, who guessed the number of people here through these signs, stood up from his place.\"Do you intend to follow?\"\"Yes.\"\"Don't you think it would be better to return and come back with your companions? We don't know what kind of enemy lies ahead.\"\"It doesn't matter who's there.\"Unless it was an Archmage who had trained only in attack magic all his life in the Pearl Tower, or a swordmaster with ample battlefield experience, there were few in this world who could injure Yuder. Considering that Yuder had even more practical experience, he would not easily yield to anyone.It was more important not to miss the traces they had finally found than fearing an unknown enemy.\"If you're scared, go back alone.\"\"How could you think that? Who do you think discovered this pit? If I were a coward, I wouldn't have followed you guys in the first place.\"\u2018Then why on earth did he ask such an unnecessary question?\u2019 Yuder frowned, thinking him as inscrutable as Kishiar.He started walking, turning his body as if to say follow if you want, and if not, don't. Shortly after, he faintly heard Nahan's footsteps behind him. The traces led them deeper into the mountains, choosing only the paths less travelled by.\"Doesn't something feel strange?\"Nahan spoke again as they approached a valley, and the radius of the forest began to widen. Yuder, carefully searching for traces, responded roughly.\"What.\"\"As we go deeper, the path is getting wider.\"\"It might be a place where the path merges with the one used by the people from the nearby village.\"\"No. It's a bit different from that\u2026\"As Nahan mumbled something, he suddenly grabbed Yuder's arm. At the same time, the air around them wavered, and the color subtly changed.\"What are you doing.\"\"Someone is coming.\"Just as he said, a few unfamiliar faces appeared from the opposite path moments later. At a glance, they looked like ordinary hunters, but there was no sight of tools such as snares or daggers for dismantling traps, which are commonly carried by hunters.They seemed completely oblivious to Yuder and Nahan, casually chatting as they gradually approached.\"Still not talking, huh? Such a stubborn bastard.\"\"Yes. Seems like he thinks he's somebody now that he's received a surname from the Emperor. He's too stubborn to speak a word.\"\"Tsk. There's no cure for an old dog. Despite dying, he's still so full of life. What the hell were the guys who were supposed to control him doing?\"\"Apparently\u2026 he's one of the capable men that Duke Peletta gathered from all over the Empire. They are trying, but it's hard. Please understand.\"\"Perhaps it would be better to simply handle them moderately and let them go, rather than using the family as bait,\" a voice said.Yuder instinctively realized who they were talking about.'Devran.'Indeed, Devran was still alive. He wasn't sure if the one dragged away and buried, bleeding in the pit, was Devran, but it was a relief that the path seemed to be leading the right way.\"Ah, and... there's one more thing I need to report to the Warden.\"\"What is it?\"\"The youngest Hartan has asked for help. He says Duke Peletta has already sent someone, suspecting something.\"\"Someone?\"The man called the Warden stopped in his tracks. Through the branches, a blurry view of brown hair and a face was visible. For a moment, Yuder froze as he realized that this man was from his previous life's memory.'That guy is...'The Apeto Dukedom, one of the four great dukedoms. In Yuder's memory, it was a place quieter than the other dukedoms but equally sinister.The man who was going to receive the title of Duke of Apeto about five years later had the same face as this Warden, who had been his direct subordinate.Younger than his memory, but it was definitely him. He had seen his face and greeted him several times at the party he had attended as a Cavalry commander.'I can't remember his name, but there's no doubt about it.'People from the Apeto Dukedom were in the east, where the Diarca Dukedom's power was strong. It wasn't impossible for them to be there, but it was strange to run into them on this mountain, especially since the circumstances made it clear they were the ones who took Devran Hartude.Without knowing exactly what was going on, Yuder tried to quickly recall his memory while not missing the conversation unfolding before him.\"Yes. They sent four people, all of whom are said to be capable.\"\"It's a bit early, but we did expect them to send such people. If we ignore them, they'll find nothing and return. Tell him to ignore it. Instead, tell them to pay more attention to his brother!\"\"I conveyed as much, but it seems he\u2019s still worried. He was asking us to send someone in case the Diarca side notices something because of their rampaging.\"\"We don't have people to spare. Did he not anticipate even this situation when he betrayed Diarca and killed his own father and sister? He\u2019s the one who reached out to us, blinded by the desire for a small-town lordship. Tsk! Just ignore that coward.\"\"Understood.\"\"We've already found everyone we could find here, and soon we'll be off, so just dealing with them casually is enough.\"The Warden clicked his tongue and moved on, his expression filled with dissatisfaction.'Zakail Hartan betrayed Diarca and joined hands with Apeto, then killed the previous lord and his sister... All for the lordship.'It was an unexpected story.'But even if he's after the lordship, what does any of this have to do with Devran?'As he watched the Warden's party heading uphill, Yuder moved to follow them without realizing it. However, Nahan, who was holding his arm, stopped him.\"Don't get any closer.\"\"...\"\"Although we had covered ourselves with an illusion to appear as trees, there could still be those who were sensitive enough to notice our presence.\"A murmuring, as though someone were saying 'like you,' seemed to drift on the edge of hearing.Just then, one of the men who had silently followed the group, dressed as a hunter, suddenly turned his head and looked toward Yuder and Nahan.\"Over there!\"\"What?\"\"I heard something from over there!\"It appeared that Nahan's advice had come too late. The men dressed as hunters took up a defensive stance all at once, and the Warden also turned his body, revealing a cold gaze.\"Who's there! Reveal yourself!\"Although they had not yet detected the illusion, it was only a matter of time until they did, now that they knew something was there. Yuder subtly moved his right hand to rest on the hilt of the practice sword loosely hanging at his waist.\"... Count to three and then dispel the illusion.\"\"Are you planning to handle all of them by yourself?\"\"It's not a problem, just keep track of the time.\"Yuder etched the number and positions of the people in front of him into his mind and began to count quietly.\"One... two....\"\"Ha! Okay, we come out. What now?\"His count to three was cut off. Yuder, hand still resting on the hilt of his sword, turned around. Two people were emerging from behind the rocks near where Yuder and Nahan were standing.One person was unknown, but the other was very familiar. He was Kiolle Da Diarca, a member of the Diarca family and a knight from the Imperial Knights.'...Why is he here?'\"You guys are pretty quick on the uptake. What are you doing here?\"\"...\"\"I am Senior Knight Kiolle Da Diarca of the Imperial Knights. This is one of the places where the Imperial Knights come to train every year, under the auspices of the Diarca family. I have never heard of people like you staying here. Who are you?\"Kiolle's gaze was as arrogant as ever. As he scrutinized the people from the Apeto dukedom, the Warden stepped forward. Yuder could see an intense whirl of emotions stirring ceaselessly within his eyes.\"Ah, so you are the knights of the Imperial Knights. I've heard much about your reputation. Have you come here... hmm. For training?\"\"Didn't you hear what I just said? That's right!\"\"We're just passing hunters... we'll leave soon. So please don't be too angry.\"Given that he didn't know how much Kiolle had heard, the Warden seemed to have decided to play dumb. However, all Kiolle saw in his eyes was a hint of contempt.\"Hunters, huh. Do you think I'd believe that?\"\"...It's true. We are......\"\"Dogs of Apeto daring to venture this far without fear. You must not fear death. I'll figure out what kind of tricks you've been pulling here and report it to my father.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The numerous worries that had been lurking over his downcast face seemed to dissipate into the cold air.\"...Did you hear what we said?\"\"Yes, I heard!\"\"I see. Do you happen to know where the other knights who came here for training are now?\"\"Why are you asking about those bastards?\"\"Well\u2026\"Touching his ear and stalling, the Warden signaled the others around him with a nod and gave a chilly smile.\"I'm curious how long it would take for them to notice if the idiot youngest of the Diarca family disappeared from here.\"\"What?\"\"Just take care of it and don't worry about it! After all, there's only two of them!\"\"Yes!\"Excluding the Warden and his closest subordinate, eight men all stepped forward at once. Yuder soon understood why most of them did not hold weapons.Out of the three who had drawn their weapons, the others began to showcase threatening auras. Their hands and feet began to grotesquely transform as elemental powers like fire and water began to manifest.\"...So five of the Awakeners have joined.\"In the momentary standoff, Nahan, who had grabbed Yuder's shoulder, moved him aside and murmured in a low voice.\"I think I might have an idea where my missing brothers have gone.\"\"Ki, Kiolle sir! There are too many enemies! Are you really going to confront them like this? It would be better if we first retreated\u2026\u2026!\"From behind Kiolle, a panicked knight panted out. His hand, holding the sword, trembled, suggesting that he was barely experienced in real combat.\"You're talking nonsense, Paviel. Members of the Diarca never retreat in front of vermin like these. Let alone, there are some among them who possess powers that I absolutely can't forgive. And you're telling me to retreat? Obviously, they all have to die!\"\"But\u2026!\"\"Paviel. If you're thinking of turning your back on me now, even if you survive, Diarca will never forgive you. Are you scared of those vermin, spewing fire and strutting around with the power gifted by the Red Stone?\"At the mention of \"vermin spewing fire\", Kiolle gnashed his teeth.'\u2026Hmm. That\u2019s probably... because of me.'Yuder felt an odd sensation as he belatedly realized that the source of Kiolle's intense anger, which had clouded his judgment, might have been due to their past interactions. The young knight appeared to still be in a state of confusion.\"\u2026\"A mixture of terror and resentment flickered across the knight named Paviel's face.\"No\u2026\"\"That's right. That's how it should be. I knew you were here to monitor me under my father's orders. He probably promised you a promotion. But, in the end, that promise ends if I object. Understand?\"\"Yes\u2026\"\"This is the only time your noble background, being from the Han family, will be useful.\"Kiolle's icy words echoed as his gaze turned towards the enemy, who was charging at him with arms transformed into swords.\"In the end, they are too scared of the consequences to kill us! They're all talk! Go!\"\u2018Well, they might be able to kill you.\u2019 Yuder felt a twinge of regret that he couldn't voice his thoughts as he watched them clash.Though the group consisted of five Awakeners, and three quite skilled swordsmen, Kiolle and his fellow knight fought admirably.Watching Kiolle hold his own against the Awakeners, Yuder thought that the experiences he had endured, though they had knocked him unconscious, might not have been entirely useless.Judging by their previous exchanges, it seemed that the arrogant knight from the Diarca family had been here for training by sheer coincidence. Mentions of other knights suggested that they might be in the vicinity as well. The longer the battle dragged on, the more disadvantageous it would be for Apeto's side.\"Damn it. They just had to show up for training right now... this is getting annoying. Damn Diarca, causing trouble in his entire life.\"They\u2019ve heard the place where the knights in training are staying is far from here. Nobody, not even the Warden, would have thought they'd run into them here. That's why there weren't any orders for them to move from above.As Kiolle and his subordinates fought, the Warden of the Apeto family and his subordinates, standing not too far away, expressed their anger loudly.\"What on earth did that man do in the capital to come here all of a sudden?\"\"From what I know, he's been causing continuous trouble and disorder within the Imperial Knights. It's said that the Duke himself sent him here for training to calm the resentment built up in his heart.\"\"Resentment, my foot. Does that guy look like someone who'd have something built up in his heart? It's more like he's building resentment in the hearts of others! He's an ignorant youngster who doesn't know how high the sky is, thanks to his well-connected father!\"Yuder agreed with what he heard, empathizing greatly with the angry voice of the Warden.\"We cannot let him live once he hears the name 'Apeto'. Kill him here to prevent any future problems. Push harder! What are you doing against just two opponents!\"At the sharp cry of the Warden, the movements of the fighters paused momentarily, then resumed with even more intensity.Though their abilities were suitable for combat, they lacked experience. Fighting without disturbing several comrades in a forest filled with obstacles required tact, something they seemed to lack.'... Did they gather those who just awakened? They are incredibly clumsy.'Kiolle and his fellow knight remained surprisingly composed against them. However, as the enemies started to charge desperately after the Warden's order, they were quickly overwhelmed.\"U-uh, Sir Kiolle! We should retreat and scatter them!\"\"... Retreating now will do no good! What on earth did you learn in the Imperial Knight!\"Even in this critical moment, Kiolle was stubborn. His judgment wasn't bad, but ultimately two people couldn't face eight.'If they had turned and run from the start, picking off the scattered enemies, they might have had a chance.'Kiolle's excessive hatred for the Awakeners ended up ruining everything. Yuder watched as wounds gradually accumulated on Kiolle and his fellow knight, contemplating what to do next.He definitely needed to capture one from the Apeto side for information, but he hesitated on what to do about Kiolle's side.If he left them to die, there was a high risk that the Diarca Ducal House, who would likely learn about the knight group's presence in the nearby village, would stir up trouble. However, revealing himself to save them could lead to repercussions from Kiolle himself later on.'I thought he was a man who would die quickly in my previous life because he didn't stand out... But at least back then, he wouldn't have died here.'In a way, the entire vacation time of the Cavalry caused by Yuder had twisted the situation up to this point.\"Tch!\"\"What the hell are you doing, Paviel!\"Then, another great uproar arose around Kiolle, who was in the midst of fighting. Yuder, whose eyes had been lost in thought, looked up and felt a surprising emotion upon seeing the subordinate knight step forward, drop his weapon, and raise both hands.\"It can't be helped. Kiolle, you are a Diarca, I don't want to die here because of your stupidity! I'm surrendering, so spare me!\"The subordinate knight, more severely wounded than Kiolle, was covered in countless wounds on his right arm and both legs. Deciding it was too hard to hold his sword any longer, it appeared he had chosen to betray Kiolle and attempt surrender.\"...You dishonor our knighthood!\"\"The one who doesn't know shame is you, Kiolle! Why should I die because of you! Because of you, a bastard, who relies solely on the power of your family!\"\"What... did you say?\"Kiolle raised his sword to strike down the knight in a fit of fury. But the Warden's hand was quicker. As soon as he raised his hand, one of the henchmen, dressed like a hunter and holding a sword, blocked Kiolle's attack. The clash of metal against metal echoed as Kiolle dropped his sword.The surroundings fell silent as the battle calmed down for a moment.\"Ha... This is something. I didn't anticipate this.\"The Warden looked at the knight who had surrendered and gave a grim smile.\"So there is a knight like you who knows what's practical in the honorable Imperial Knights. I wouldn't have wanted to die for such a person either. I understand.\"\"...\"\"You said spare me... I can spare you. But I can't show sympathy without any compensation. Why should I spare you when I could kill both of you?\"\"Anything... I'll do anything. I'll keep the secrets.\"\"Paviel, you...\"Kiolle's eyes twitched in disbelief. However, the subordinate knight didn't look back at him, just kept his head bowed.The Warden seemed greatly amused by this and burst into hearty laughter.\"Ha, ha, ha... This is truly a sight to behold. Noble knights who vowed to serve God and pledge loyalty betraying each other... Especially when one is a thorn in the side like Diarca.\"\"...\"Yuder saw the Warden move his snake-like thin eyes and give a subtle signal to his subordinates who were lined up around him. He then continued nonchalantly.\"Does anyone know that you knights came here?\"\"Eight other knights who came here with us know. But they won't come looking for us.\"\"Why?\"At the Warden's question, the subordinate knight clenched his lips with an enraged expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stormed out in protest of this training...\"\"Hmm. So, you were forced to follow such a lad and ended up running into us. That's unfortunate indeed.\"If he had arrived just a little later, or if he had stayed quiet where he was, none of this unpleasantness would have happened. The Warden's words made the subordinate knight grind his teeth in agreement, bowing his head even lower.\"So, you didn't know we were here?\"\"We honestly didn't.\"\"How much of our conversation did you overhear?\"\"...I heard from the part where you mentioned four Awakeners. But I didn't listen properly. I only heard Apeto's name because Kiolle recognized one of your faces and got angry. I didn't know who your family was.\"\"He recognized the face?\"The steward turned to glare at Kiolle, his face wrinkled in annoyance. Kiolle met his gaze defiantly, still bleeding yet unbowed.\"Did you see us before, you idiot of the Diarca family?\"\"That's right. That brat behind you, the one always accompanying the second of the Apeto family. The audacious one who dared to spill alcohol on my shoes!\"At Kiolle's words, the man next to the Warden looked taken aback, apparently surprised that Kiolle truly remembered him.\"...So, you have a better memory than I thought.\"\"Do you take me for a fool? I intended to punish him at that time, but that cunning scoundrel managed to sneak you away and we moved on. I may forget other things, but never something like that!\"Through Kiolle's outburst, it became clear to everyone that he never forgot even the smallest of grudges.'Weak and arrogant, yet never forgets a grudge... Those types are the most bothersome.'Yuder sighed softly, recalling the two times he had knocked down the man. The Warden also seemed to share the same thought, rolling his narrow eyes in contemplation.\"Was it Paviel? Thanks to you, it seems like we have less trouble, so we express our gratitude.\"\"Then...!\"Just as the subordinate knight was about to lift his head as if he wanted to ask if he was going to be spared, his voice abruptly cut off. A hunter-clad Awakener had quietly approached and swiftly pierced his neck.\"Co, ugh!\"The subordinate knight clutched at his throat as he collapsed. Amidst the spurting blood, he quickly breathed his last.\"Paviel...! Urgh!\"\"Knock him out and bring him along. There shouldn't be any repercussions, so we should extract some information about Diarca before killing him.\"Yuder watched as the hunters carried Kiolle, who had collapsed after being hit on the head, next to Paviel's lifeless body, treating them like mere baggage.Only after the noise had sufficiently subsided did Nahan remove his hand from Yuder's shoulder. The surroundings, which had seemed slightly faded, returned to their original vivid colors. The illusion ability that had been hiding their presence had ended.Yuder slowly moved forward, looking down at the ground stained with blood from Paviel's corpse.\"Taking the corpse, they must be planning to make him disappear without a trace.\"Seeing the blood-stained ground, Nahan muttered to himself, briefly turning his gaze away. Yuder immediately shook his head to contradict his words.\"No, they're probably trying to manipulate the culprit.\"What they wanted was to interrogate Kiolle about the Diarca Ducal Family, extract as much information as they could, then kill and dispose of him. The best way to avoid raising the Diarca's suspicions was to create a separate perpetrator.The easiest option would be to frame the deceased knight, but if that wasn't feasible, they would likely shift their focus to the Cavalry staying in Hartan. There was a good chance they had already considered this far. Either way, it didn't bother Yuder much.'First, follow them and confirm their destination, then...'\"Apeto. Diarca. According to what I know, these are all names of prestigious ducal families. Am I right?\"As he continued his thoughts, preparing to follow the people of the Apeto family who had taken Kiolle and disappeared, Yuder turned his head at the sudden question.Somehow, the illusion that had enveloped him was now completely dispelled, revealing his original form. One of his grey eyes, visible beneath his dark blue hair that resembled the night sky, stared intently at Yuder.\"...Yes, you're right.\"\"That's surprising. My brothers always said that the nobles here just hate the emperor, but their relationships with each other are quite strong. But it seems it's not quite so.\"\"...\"The people of the Apeto family, behaving suspiciously in a region under the strong influence of the Diarca, were bold enough to attempt to kill a member of the Diarca family that found them. Seeing this, it would be natural to think they were not in good terms, but Yuder's thoughts differed.In his past life, while serving as the emperor's confidant, he had seen many aspects of the Four Great Ducal Houses. To Yuder, they appeared like a legendary serpent monster with many heads but one body.They constantly bit and fought each other for better prey, but their survival as a whole always took precedence.For instance, even if it were revealed that the Apeto family killed Kiolle, the son of the Diarca family, the Diarca wouldn't openly protest to the Apeto family.They might take small, private revenge beneath the surface, but they would never let it escalate into a major feud between the families. That was the tacit rule of the Four Great Ducal Houses, handed down for a thousand years since the founding of the Empire.'As long as order is maintained, glory is everlasting.'That's what the Emperor Yuder served in his past life once said about this fact. Therefore, he shouldn't conclude from this incident alone that relations between the ducal families were bad.They were a very strange group, killing each other one moment, yet willing to sacrifice their lives to protect each other in different matters.However, he wasn't inclined to explain such complex facts to Nahan in detail. As Yuder remained silent, Nahan soon changed the subject.\"The risk of being discovered from now on will be much higher than before. We don't know how many more of our brothers are in the direction they're heading. But you're going to continue, aren't you?\"\"Yes.\"Yuder's answer was short and concise. Nahan slightly raised the corners of his mouth, as if he had expected this response, and promptly restored his illusion.They continued to climb deeper into the mountains, following the traces of the people from the Apeto family. Thanks to the large number of people moving at once, footprints and bloodstains were more distinct, making it much easier to trace them. It was fortunate.\"Look, it leads into a cave over there.\"Their trail led deep into the valley, finally ending inside a cave. It was cleverly hidden between the rocks, so much so that without the blood droplets marking the path, they might never have found it.Upon listening closely, they could faintly hear the sound of human voices echoing from within. The source was unquestionably there.'We've confirmed the location, so we can return and contact Gakane and Jimmy...'However, the presence of many more people inside than they had anticipated made them wary. Although there was no immediate need to make contact, the people inside the cave might never be found again if not sought out now. Yuder composed himself and turned to Nahan.\"Could we hide ourselves again as we did earlier and enter?\"\"I'm not sure. It's easy to hide in a forest by blending with the trees, but in a cave, it's difficult to figure out what we could disguise ourselves as.\"\"That does sound challenging.\"Yuder decided they would incapacitate anyone they encountered as soon as they entered. At times like these, the best strategy was to launch stones with the wind.\"What are you looking for?\"\"A stone to launch.\"\"You're going to throw a stone? Why?\"\"Because if we can't hide and enter, it's faster to knock everyone we meet unconscious.\"At Yuder's explanation, Nahan made a strange expression.\"I guess you're not joking.\"\"I don't do pointless things.\"\"...In that case, we might not have to wait very long. Someone is coming out from within.\"True to his words, the voices from within the cave were growing louder. A shadow began to stir, prompting Yuder and Nahan to hide amongst the dense trees.Two of the hunter-dressed underlings, who had followed the man they'd called 'Warden' earlier, emerged from within. Yuder guessed they had come out to fetch water, noticing the large water jugs in their hands.'Were they both Awakeners... This works in our favor.'Yuder felt around with his foot, picking up two small pebbles. As he threw them, he employed the full force of the wind.Soon after, there was a sound akin to fruit being struck by a stone, followed by the two men collapsing onto the ground. Yuder approached them and thoroughly examined their unconscious bodies.\"Did you kill them?\"\"They're only unconscious.\"Yuder responded to Nahan's question while searching through the unconscious men's belongings, finding a small dagger and a few cigarettes. It seemed they had not just come out for water, but had intended to have a smoke and rest as well.'Nothing much of note here.'Using the dagger, Yuder ripped pieces from their clothes to tie up their hands and legs, then stuffed cloth into their mouths. He hid them well behind the same trees they had concealed themselves in earlier. After this, he turned to Nahan, who had been observing the entire scene, without any hesitation.\"You mentioned earlier that you didn't know what to disguise ourselves as inside the cave.\"Nahan's eyes widened slightly as if realizing what Yuder was about to say. A look of astonishment, or perhaps incredulity, flitted across them, only to disappear shortly after.\"That's right.\"\"It seems we have figured it out now.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yuder couldn't see his own appearance, but he looked down at his body, which seemed to be wearing unfamiliar clothes, and realized that the illusion ability had been properly applied.They pocketed the personal items of the unconscious ones and entered the cave with their water containers. The outside was so dense that it seemed impossible to see an inch ahead, but unexpectedly, it was not so dark inside.Following an obviously artificially carved path, they were taken aback as someone suddenly stuck out his face from within. It was a man they hadn't met before.\"Huh? Who are you guys? Did you already return from fetching water?\"Yuder didn't respond immediately. Neither did Nahan. Seeing this, the man's face twisted into an annoyed expression.\"Ah, I see. You didn't even get water and just came back smoking your pipes? You're caught now. Today, I can finally show the Warden how useless you guys are! Hand over your water container! Show it to me!\"The man rolled up his sleeves and confidently approached them. Yuder subtly used his power to fill the empty water containers that he and Nahan were holding in a flash.If Nahan had stumbled due to the suddenly heavy water container, they would have been immediately exposed. However, Nahan merely glanced at Yuder once, standing firm without any significant movement.\"I've disliked you since you were selected just because you could use some insignificant ability. What do you think is so great about you guys? You're no different from the guys locked up in there! All of you are nothing but liars...!\"The man, who was coming towards them all fired up, fell silent instantly when he saw the water container filled to the brim.\"\u2026Huh?\"\"Can we go now?\"In the brief moment the man was stupefied, Yuder quickly responded in a low, indifferent voice.\"Uh\u2026 uh huh. How did you manage to get water in such a short time...\"\"Let's go.\"Leaving the shocked man behind, Yuder emptied the water from the container again. Similar incidents occurred with several others, but no one was able to discern their disguises.Through the disgusted gazes of the others, Yuder was able to glean some information about this place.Inside this cave, several Awakeners were imprisoned. The person they called the Warden was said to be 'selecting' these Awakeners. The individuals Yuder and Nahan were disguised as were Awakeners specially employed to protect the Warden who was doing dangerous things.'Just based on the revealed information, it's clear this isn't an ordinary place.'Although he didn't show it, Yuder was internally astonished. He already knew in his previous life that there were nobles who used the Awakeners like slaves.However, that was considered akin to buying skilled slaves from other countries, hence it was treated as private affairs of the high-ups that couldn't be infringed upon.In this era, where only about two years had passed since the Awakeners had revealed themselves to the world, he had never heard of a family capturing Awakeners on such a large scale.'Selection, huh? What are they planning to do with the selected Awakeners? In my previous life, the Apeto family was consistently loyal to the emperor and never caused any major incidents related to the Awakeners...'Could the Apeto family really have been involved in something like this? Yuder furrowed his brows, recalling Nahan's words, 'In the East, it's common for Awakeners to be falsely accused and disappear after being arrested'.If those who had been caught experienced a similar ordeal, it meant that at least two noble families in the eastern region were engaging in such activities, targeting the Awakeners.'I wonder if Kishiar was aware of this.'Had he known, given his nature, he would have certainly mentioned it before sending Yuder. Yuder, who had lived several years longer than Kishiar, hadn't known about such occurrences in his previous life, indicating there was a high chance that Kishiar too hadn't known. This led to a certain speculation.'Even though they had kidnapped the Awakeners, either their intended purposes hadn't been achieved, or perhaps they were achieved sooner than expected, and they felt no need to maintain these places any longer, quickly closing them down.'In his previous life, the missions Yuder had been directly assigned were nearly always the most dangerous, involving handling monstrous threats or the assassination and capture of rebels.After becoming the Cavalry Commander, the Emperor told Yuder not to take interest in anything other than what he was specifically ordered to, and strictly prohibited him from taking independent action without permission.Even if not for that command, Yuder hadn't had the leeway to divert his attention elsewhere, busy as he was with managing the Cavalry, the most dangerous group on the continent.It was only when several years had passed since his rise to the position of Commander and he started doubting whether there might be some hidden motive behind the events happening all around the world, that he was able to shift his focus outward.In the blind spots he hadn't had a chance to look into in his previous life, what were they trying to achieve by doing such things?\"...A fork in the path.\"Nahan spoke quietly to Yuder, who was deep in thought while walking. True to his word, there was a fork in the path before them. According to the information given by those they had encountered before, the left path led to a prison, while the right led to the space where the Warden and others stayed.\"To the left.\"Yuder promptly decided the direction, feeling around the cave floor and picking up a few pebbles to put in his pocket.The path leading to the prison was steep and exceptionally winding. They hadn't placed many magic stones to provide light, so it was extremely dark. They had to feel their way along the wall to move forward.\"Who goes there?\"After walking for a while, they came across three Awakeners sitting in the middle of the path. Recognizing them as the underlings of the Warden they had encountered earlier, Yuder felt dismayed.'They must know the owners of these disguises... they'll discover us soon.'If they were discovered, they could knock them out, but dealing with Awakeners was tricky. If they didn't succeed in one hit, a ruckus could arise.As Yuder was contemplating throwing a stone from his pocket, the seated Awakeners spoke with bored expressions.\"Number 2, Number 4. It's not time for shift change yet, why are you here early? And what's with that water container?\"\"You said you were going out for a smoke. Don't tell me that red-haired old man started a fight again?\"'These guys... don't they call each other by name? Lucky.'Yuder, releasing his grip on the tightly held water container, calmly opened his mouth.\"Well, something like that.\"\"I knew it. That crazy old man. Does he think we're here because we like it? I'd have killed him before he got me in here.\"\"The conditions are terrible. Why on a day like today, after fighting to the death, without proper treatment, we're trapped in this sunless underground?\"\"Exactly, my wounded arm still hurts.\"As if they had been waiting to speak, the three of them started to argue at the same time. Then, from the dark corridor, there were a few small sounds like a suppressed groan of a beast. The Awakeners continued talking, not paying any attention, but Yuder felt the sound was very unsettling.\"What's that noise, Number 3?\"\"I'm Number 1. Number 3 is with the Warden.\"Yuder had randomly picked a number to draw the others' attention to his question, but unfortunately, he called for someone who wasn't present. Yuder quickly changed his approach.\"Sorry, I have a condition where I can't see well in the dark. What's that noise, Number 1?\"\"It's the whimpering of the young man from the noble family we caught earlier. But did you have such a condition?\"\u2018Ah, so I'm Number 2.\u2019 Yuder nodded his head, trying to remember the nickname of his character.\"Yes, I mentioned it before. Try to remember. So, has he been like this since then?\"\"Yeah. It's so annoying. Doesn't that boy know when to give up? He should save his energy, since he's going to die anyway. Among those trapped here, he's probably the worst.\"\"If it weren't for the Warden's orders, I would have shut him up.\"Kiolle da Diarca seemed to attract no sympathy even for a stranger he had just met.'Impressive if nothing else.'Thanks to the continuous, grim, and desperate whimpering of Kiolle, the atmosphere among the Awakeners became more relaxed.The three Awakeners seemed to have stopped doubting Yuder and Nahan. Yuder, while casually agreeing with their trivial chat, pointed towards the inside as if he found something.\"Wait, is that guy...?\"\"Huh? ...Eek!\"\"What...Ugh!\"Although his voice lacked any surprise, fortunately, the Awakeners fell for it. As they turned their heads in surprise, three stones flew and hit the back of their heads.Looking down at the three Awakeners who fell without making a sound, Yuder signaled to Nahan who had been quietly standing.\"Number 4. Search their pockets quickly.\"\"I'm Number 4?\"\"I'm Number 2, so you must be Number 4.\"Even though Nahan looked as if he might say something, he didn't utter a word. He kneeled down and rummaged through the pockets of the Awakeners, finding a bundle of keys. Yuder took them and moved forward decisively.Not long after, several small rooms with solid iron doors appeared. They were designed with iron bars at the top to allow looking inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is Devran Hartude here?\"\"...\"Even after the voice echoed, the prison remained eerily quiet. Even Kiolle's groans had subsided, intensifying the grim atmosphere.\"Devran Hartude. I am a Cavalry member here to rescue you. The Commander has ordered me to bring you. If you're here, answer.\"Having said that, Yuder quietly counted in his mind. He planned to open all the doors at once if there was no response after counting to a hundred.Fortunately, around the count of ten, someone from inside a cell drew a ragged breath and spoke.\"Are, really, Cavalry?\"Suspicion and trembling could be felt from the exhausted voice. Yuder moved toward the cell where the voice originated, fumbling with a bunch of keys.\"Devran. Is that really you?\"Before inserting the key, he asked for final confirmation. A dark shadow within the cell sluggishly stirred. With a voice that sounded strangled, as if at the brink of death, the figure managed to speak.\"\u2026Yes. I am, Dev, ran.\"Yuder glanced back at Nahan and gave a subtle nod. The man, understanding the signal to disable the illusion ability, immediately moved his hand to dispel the power.Yuder began to unlock the door with the keys he held. Fortunately, on the third attempt, the lock clicked open with a metallic sound.The cell was narrow and filthy. Amidst the stench of blood and waste, a single person was sitting. Yuder halted when he saw the man's hands and feet bound by iron chains that looped through two rings on the upper part of the wall, constricting his neck.Yuder was well aware of this method of binding. The victim's hands and feet were stretched painfully until the chain around the neck loosened just enough, only to strangle the victim if they relaxed even slightly.It was one of the methods used on the most dangerous criminals. Yuder, having experienced it in his past life, knew all too well the malicious agony it inflicted.A criminal bound this way couldn't even sleep properly. If they relaxed their strained limbs due to fatigue, they would be strangled to death.The reason why most people trapped in this prison could barely make a noise was that they were all bound in the same way. Yuder grimaced at the scene more brutal than he expected and drew the practice sword attached to his waist.\"It's, impossible. This chain isn't, ordinary...\"Devran tried to articulate that ordinary strength wouldn't be able to break the chain, but Yuder's sword touched the chain and cut it faster than he could finish.With a clanging sound, his arms lost their strength and fell to the ground. The chain around his neck lost its purpose. Devran managed to gasp, his suppressed cough exploding out.\"Cough, cough!\"Yuder conjured up some light to illuminate the cell further. He wanted to get a clearer look at Devran's face.\"Devran. Can you see my face?\"\"I, I can. Yuder, of the, Shin....\"Devran indicated that he had managed to recognize Yuder, despite his ragged, labored breaths. His condition was grim, marred by blood and filth, yet no signs of permanent damage or broken bones were visible. Whoever had handled Devran had not intended to kill him; this much had become clear.\"Yes, your mind seems to be intact, that's good. Now tell me, what happened to you?\"\"\u2026\"At those words, Devran wore a deeply pained expression. His hand, full of wounds, but once likely robust, clutched at the hem of Yuder's garment. Between his disheveled hair, an anger smoldered in his uniquely brown eyes.\"...I was, tricked. It was, a trap, from the start\u2026\u2026.\"Tricked? By whom?Yuder knelt on one knee, directly meeting Devran's gaze.\"By whom?\"\"They tried, to sell off, Dermilla, while I was away. So, I\u2026!\"\"Hold on. It's hard to understand you. Try to answer concisely.\"Yuder gently patted Devran's shoulder, who was unable to hide his agitation even as he was coughing. Underneath his calm voice, Devran shot a resentful glance at him but quickly quieted down when Yuder created a small ball of water in mid-air.\"Drink this first.\"\"\u2026Thank you.\"After swallowing the ball of water that Yuder had placed in his mouth, Devran took a moment to catch his breath. His eyes became markedly calmer. Only then did Yuder recognize that Devran was ready for a proper conversation and calmly asked,\"Start from when you went on leave. What happened?\"\"\u2026Alright. After getting leave, I went straight to my hometown.\"Devran's story could be summed up as follows: He had not informed his family beforehand about his leave, so upon his arrival, he noticed a strange atmosphere among the surprised villagers. The reason became clear once he reached his home.'Devran, my boy! The Lord has ordered your sister, Dermilla, to marry a man from the neighboring village!'His father, whose one leg had been impaired due to an accident from his youth, clung to Devran, shedding tears.'The man she's supposed to marry is a widowed blacksmith known for his rough temper, who's killed two people! When Dermilla resisted, he locked her up in the castle. They say they'll keep her until the wedding day and then send her off. What are we to do?'Devran felt his world darken. What he had feared had finally come to pass.His father didn't know, but his younger sister had fallen in love with Zachlis, the Lord's eldest son, a long time ago. However, Zachlis, knowing his father would never approve of his marriage to a commoner, had enlisted in a Knight Order far away to avoid his father's watchful eyes.Upon settling there, he had promised to come back for Dermilla, a promise she had shared with Devran. He remembered the anger he felt when he heard this.That's why Devran was overjoyed when he was accepted into the Cavalry, even if it meant his awakened powers were known and he had to endure the scorn from his village. He had no trust in nobles; he only wanted to get his family out as soon as the opportunity arose.In that process, he considered the worst-case scenario to be Zachlis pressuring the Lord to prevent him from leaving. But he had not anticipated things would turn sour this quickly.What would have happened if he hadn't taken his leave? He felt suffocated.\"Sir Zachlis? Is he not in the village at present?\"\"Why him? He, of course, must still be with the knight order...\"There was no mistaking it: somehow, the relationship between the Lord's eldest son and the commoner girl had been discovered. Despite not knowing why, seeing the Lord maliciously trying to send Dermilla to the neighboring village made it clear.Could it be that the Lord just wanted to get rid of Dermilla? It might be early, but what if he went to him and asked if they could leave for the capital together with their family?The request that he had already intended to make had merely been expedited, and it was not like the Lord wanted to have a dispute with him, and made a foe of the Cavalry.Devran had faith in the presence of the Cavalry behind him and the name of the Duke of Peletta, Kishiar La Orr.\"I went to the castle of the Lord. Though the Lord himself wouldn't meet me because he was unwell, his eldest daughter, Zupiel, who came to inherit the title, thought it would be better to listen to me. Thanks to her, I was able to return home safely with Dermilla. I decided to take my father and Dermilla to the capital when my vacation ended. But that night... the Lord called for me again.\"He had a bad feeling about it. Devran told his father and sister not to leave the house and headed alone for the Lord's castle. However, what he faced upon entering the castle was a fierce fire, as if to swallow the entire castle.\"It was obvious at a glance that it wasn't an ordinary fire. There was an Awakener who could wield fire there that day.\"Devran not only had the ability to summon fire, but also to control an existing one to some extent. However, no matter how hard he tried, the fire spread uncontrollably, almost as if it had a will of its own.He was captured by the villagers who, misunderstanding him as the culprit, rushed at him in anger. He was thrown into prison, confused and worried about his father and sister.\"The next day, Zakail, the Lord's youngest son, returned and declared me guilty. And then, I...\"After being beaten to near-death in prison, Devran was buried alive near the Rock of Death, where prisoners were buried, with a sack over his face, at a time when he couldn't tell if it was day or night. When he woke up, he was here.'Are you awake? Let's have a chat now.'A strange man greeted the conscious Devran. He introduced himself as one who followed the 'High One.''I was doing some tedious work before you showed up.'Through the man and his subordinates, Devran learned a lot. They were expanding the power of the Duke of Apeto secretly in the East, where the support of the Diarca ducal family was strong.They had been attending to the request of a 'Contractor' who had agreed to support them and joined hands, when Devran suddenly appeared.'You're kind of special among all the Awakeners. It\u2019s a stroke of luck, being able to capture the confidant of the cunning Duke Peletta.'The man wanted to extract information about the Cavalry and Duke Peletta from Devran. But Devran never opened his mouth.The Cavalry was the place that had saved his life, and the Emperor and Commander Kishiar were the ones who had acknowledged him for the first time. He had lived in contempt as a commoner, but he vowed never to betray.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen they realized their scheme had been exposed, they changed their methods. They attempted to persuade him using the lives of his father and younger sister as bait and subjected him to severe torture, just shy of breaking his bones.Moreover, they had attached a magic bomb to his body, which would instantly detonate upon detecting any use of his abilities, rendering him powerless.Devran could only hope that they would sense something was wrong when he failed to return to the Cavalry.He cherished his family, but he hated the thought of betraying the Cavalry just as much. Incredibly, his heart had hardened in the mere months since he joined the Cavalry to an extent he could hardly believe himself.And now, the hope sent by the Commander himself had truly appeared before him.Devran knew that the man with black hair standing before him was the most skilled among the 330 Cavalry members. The fact that he had come felt like faith and salvation given to him by Commander Kishiar, and he couldn't help but shed tears. His patience and faith had not been in vain.\"Using the lives of your family as a threat... Did they show you proof that they are alive?\"\"No. But I heard their voices. From outside where I'm held\u2026\"The man named Yuder Aile spoke these chilling words with an incredibly cool demeanor, neither showing pity nor contempt for Devran.In the past, Devran had thought his coldness distasteful from afar, perhaps due to his exceptional abilities. But now, he couldn't have felt more reassured by his attitude.\"On the day of the fire, did you see who the real perpetrator was?\"\"I didn't see. But I know who it was.\"\"Who was it?\" Yuder asked coldly.\"Subordinates of a man called the Warden. One used wind, and the other used fire. They mentioned having a hard time controlling the elements\u2026\"\"I think I know who you're talking about based on your description.\"Yuder remembered all the abilities used by the Warden's Awakener subordinates when fighting with Kiolle da Diarca. Among them, there was one who used fire and another who controlled wind. Coincidentally, they were currently lying unconscious outside after being hit by a stone.'Well, that's fine. It's just surprising that Zakail Hartan turned out to be more sinister than I thought.'Yuder had suspected that Zakail Hartan was up to something, but he hadn't expected the scope of the incident to be this vast.Zakail Hartan. The youngest son of the elderly Lord Hartan. Despite being the lowest-ranked child, unable to inherit any titles or estates, his fate had 'coincidentally' changed when the Lord and his eldest daughter died.After the death of his father and the heiress sister, his older brother, who was gaining power in the knights' order, was expected to receive a higher title, hence would pay little attention to the small estate. As a result, Zakail was likely to inherit the estate. All this happened very 'coincidentally.'But could such coincidences be so common in the world? Yuder knew they couldn't and added another line to his prejudiced opinion.'If the Apeto family, who wanted to expand their influence in the East, and Zakail, who was low in the succession line, joined hands and planned everything, it all makes sense.'The elderly Lord suddenly decided to send Devran's sister away ahead of the crucial matter of inheritance because someone had informed him about a critical piece of information regarding his eldest son at that very moment. Who could have done it? Was it not the one who had to cause a big incident to prevent the inheritance?Zakail claimed that his delayed response to the fire incident was due to an errand he was running for his father in the next village, a coincidence that happened on the day of the fire. Yuder knew that the most suspicious individuals were just like him.When it came to fighting Kiolle, the Warden of the Apeto family was highly irritated at Zakail's request for help. In fact, that very statement was the biggest evidence that confirmed Yuder's suspicions.'Listening to Devran's account makes everything much more certain.'Their mistake, however, was their attempt to squeeze Devran Hartude, a Cavalry member, into that perfect evidence.Zakail probably wanted to get rid of Devran, a commoner woman's son he intended to use as a scapegoat for his plan, especially since Devran had suddenly obtained a leave and returned. The Apeto family wouldn't have wanted to miss the opportunity to capture a Cavalry member who could provide them with information about Kishiar.The two of them had similar interests and drove Devran into a trap, staging his death.They probably thought it would take a lot of time for the Cavalry to notice Devran's disappearance and send an investigation team.However, Kishiar sent people much sooner than expected, and unfortunately for them, Yuder himself was included.No, it was about to become their misfortune. Starting now.Yuder listened to Devran's sobbing as he lay on the floor, nursing his cold anger. No matter what he had been through, Devran was still alive. His limbs were intact, and if he could escape from here, he would make an excellent witness to these series of events.\"Devran. What do you think they planned to do with you if they couldn't extract information from you?\"Yuder slowly asked his final question, contemplating his next move. Devran's eyes, swollen from the beating, darkened with hatred and fear.\"...They said they'd send me to the Apeto main house. There are more skilled torturers and mages there... They said I'd make a good test subject...\"As he continued speaking, Devran gritted his teeth.\"I remember them saying that.\"\"Test subject?\"\"That's what they kept telling me. They kept using the term 'test subject' and spoke in a language I couldn't understand.\"Did that mean the Awakeners kidnapped by the Apeto family were being used for some sort of experiment?'...I've heard something similar before.'Yuder searched through the memories of his past life. When the Awakeners first appeared, all sorts of mages and priests flocked around them, trying to understand the source of their power and any peculiarities.Most conducted their research in public, but there were grim rumors of those who conducted their investigations in secret, employing methods that couldn't be exposed to the world.Of course, a lot had been discovered about the Awakeners as research progressed, and the population's transformation increased day by day, gradually slowing down the trend of conducting research by any means necessary.'It didn't just slow down... There were so many chaotic incidents back then that that could be part of the reason.'Yuder shook his head to clear his thoughts. He had heard everything he needed to from Devran, and now it was time to move.\"Devran. Can you stand?\"\"Heh, I can.\"Despite being tortured for several days, Devran's tenacity had not died. Whether it was his large frame or thick bones, Devran managed to push himself up, leaning against the wall for support. Yuder was impressed by Devran's grit as he bit down on his pain and groaned.'Such is the way of the Cavalry.'\"From this point onward, I will free the people trapped in other rooms. Once we figure out the reason they were detained, I will release them with you. You must escape this place. If you happen to find your family in the process, that would be excellent. If I find them first, I promise to unconditionally protect them and take them with us. So, you can rest assured. Your ability is\u2026 ah. You said something about having a bomb attached? Where is it?\"\"On...on my back.\"Devran hastily lifted the hem of his shabby shirt. There, in an ingeniously unreachable position, was a small, black magic stone. The stone was in fact a cheap piece, embedded with a low-level spell. As long as the condition for detonation wasn't met, it was not too difficult to remove.Yuder immediately detached the magical stone and put it into his pocket. A relieved sigh escaped from Devran, his expression bewildered.\"You've\u2026removed it?\"\"Yes.\"\"Just like that\u2026\"\"It's nothing if you know how. Here, catch.\"Yuder tossed Devran a small dagger he had taken from the possessions of the men they had encountered outside the cave. Grasping it, Devran's expression hardened with resolve.\"Can you use your ability?\"\"It's fine. All the guys we encounter on our way out\u2026 I won't let them be.\"Even in his heavily wounded state, Devran, who had never lost spirit, had been tortured out of fear of a cheap magic stone bomb. In his previous life, even a newly joined recruit would not have been afraid of such a thing.Yuder resolved to strongly recommend including methods to dismantle these cheap toys made by the mages when he got back to the Cavalry training program. If Kishiar were in charge, he would certainly accept.\"Let's go.\"Emerging outside the cell, Yuder opened all the cell doors and signaled to Devran.\"I will dismantle all the chains. Let's share the responsibility of bringing them out here.\"Thereafter, their operation proceeded swiftly and efficiently. Before long, except for the last prison where Kiolle was being held, all thirteen prisoners and two intruders who had been locked in eight prisons gathered in a small space in the middle of the cells.Most of the confined people were like Devran, Awakeners from the East who had resisted being taken away to Apeto Duchy and thus had been imprisoned.And, very fortunately for Devran, among those imprisoned were his own family.\"Father! Dermilla!\"\"Brother!\"Devran's younger sister had been gagged in such a way that she couldn't speak. It soon became apparent that his father had been forced to swallow a pill that took away his voice, presumably because they thought he was too old to withstand such a gag.But such a condition could be treated as long as they were alive. Devran hugged his family, tears streaming down his face.His deeply worried family had been trapped in the very next room, suffering in silence, unable to even confirm each other's wellbeing. Looking at them, Yuder exhaled deeply once more.The fact that they had been so thoroughly imprisoned but not killed, was indeed a testament to how much Apeto Duchy valued the Cavalry member Devran.Why, though? Was there a need to extract information related to the Cavalry to such an extent?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Thank you... Thank you, Yuder. I will never forget this favor.\"\"Thank you. Truly, thank you.\"Yuder bowed his head, watching the siblings repeatedly express their gratitude through tear-filled eyes. Until now, it had merely been a stroke of luck. If he had been even a bit later, Devran's family would already have been dead, and Devran himself might have been dragged to the Apeto Duchy.\"No need for thanks just yet. Save it for when we've safely escaped this place and reunited with Gakane and Jimmy in the castle of Lord Hartan.\"\"Gakane and Jimmy? They're here too?\"\"Yes. But they are within the castle, so contacting them will be difficult. Don't go inside. Use your power to create a fire big enough to be seen from the castle. Gakane will recognize it and come to you.\"Of course, Gakane would assume that Yuder was the one who started the fire, but he would soon realize that was not the case. Yuder had faith that Gakane, with his level of judgment, could easily evacuate everyone safely.After all, wasn't he a seasoned veteran who had endured relentless training for a week without even a moment's rest? It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that among the current Cavalry members, there was no one who could perform their duty as excellently as Gakane.\"Ah... understood.\"\"We'll help, too.\"As Devran nodded, other prisoners, who had been leaning on each other, raised their hands and boldly spoke up. Among them, the one who had been imprisoned the longest said he had been there for over three months.Looking at their teary eyes filled with hope and gratitude, Yuder felt slightly strange. He wondered if it was because he had never saved or rescued people in his past life. Or was it something else?\"What abilities do you possess?\"To rid himself of that nagging sense of responsibility, Yuder quickly asked them. Most were physical enhancement users, and a few were elemental ability users like Devran. Yuder, lost in thought for a moment, slowly opened his mouth.\"Form a circle with the elemental users and ordinary people in the middle, and the rest surrounding them for protection. We've encountered several people on the way out of the cave, but none were Awakeners, so they should be easy to subdue. Once outside, do not return no matter what. Go straight to Hartan's territory and join my group.\"He also told them to leave Hartan's territory as soon as possible after the reunion. Zakail Hartan was there, so it wasn't a place they could linger.\"So what will you do, Yuder?\"\"I'm going to deal with that Warden and follow after.\"\"Will you be alright? Alone, how will you...\"\"I got here by myself and I'm fine.\"To be precise, he wasn't completely alone, he had the uninvited guest Nahan with him, but he didn't bother mentioning that. Devran gave him a look that seemed unsure whether to worry or to be annoyed, but quickly nodded his head in understanding.\"I see. You are strong, you'll be fine. There's always at least a mage where those bastards hang out, so be careful. The torturers are skilled swordsmen, not to be underestimated.\"The information that there might be more than one mage was useful, so he made sure to remember it.\"Before we go, wait a minute. You there, your name was Dermilla, wasn't it?\"\"Yes.\"After ending his conversation with Devran, Yuder signaled his younger sister to come closer, beckoning her with a low call.Even while Devran was with the Cavalry, time in Hartan had kept on flowing. The odds were high that she, who had long kept a secret relationship with Zakail Hartan's brother, would have more information.\"Zakail Hartan seems to be the provider of all events. Do you happen to know anything?\"\"Lord Zakail?\"Dermilla was much more perceptive than expected and possessed a remarkably steadfast character. As soon as she heard his question, she opened her mouth as if she had guessed the situation they were in.\"Oh my. Does that mean Lord Zakail is targeting Hartan...?\"\"Perhaps.\"\"I see. Ah. Somehow... I always believed that Lord Zachlis never abandoned me. He always used to say that he was suffocated by the excessive ambition of his family. The Lord wanted to arrange Zachlis's marriage with a noblewoman from another village to increase his family's influence. And Lord Zakail, he always wanted to acquire without working for it...\"Acquire without effort - wasn't that exactly the situation Zakail was in now? Instead of responding, Yuder merely smiled faintly.\"You seem to have a good eye for people.\"\"Yes. Although he is a noble, he is a truly honest and admirable person.\"However, even he had been fooled by Zakail's schemes, hadn't he returned to the knight's order? Judging by his promise to return, it seemed that he had not completely believed in the death of his lover, but it must have been difficult for him to understand his sibling, who was constantly plotting while confined within the territory, given his own busy schedule as part of the knight's order.\"There's a high probability that he believes your family is dead by now.\"Yuder added that the villagers believed Devran had killed his family, set their house on fire, burned down half the village, and then committed suicide in prison. They had to prevent the three family members from showing their faces to the villagers in case they spread the truth.\"It might be a little worrying, but once we're completely out of here and into the safety of the capital, I'll contact him.\"\"Oh, by the way...\"Dermilla, who had obediently nodded, suddenly turned her gaze as if she remembered something.\"A few years ago, Lord Zachlis apologized to me with a regretful face. He told me that he accidentally revealed to his brother his plan to marry me and leave this place forever after establishing a new base in the knight's order... But he also said that since neither of them could inherit the territory or the title, they could keep it a secret to that extent. I forgot about that after he said it, but maybe...\"Although that wasn't essentially helpful information, it seemed sufficient as a motive.The feelings of competition against two rivals and only one were no different. Perhaps Zakail Hartan had been dreaming of the impossible from that time.\"Also, there were many rumors that Lord Zakail was a worry to the Lord because he quit school in the middle and returned a year ago, continuously wandering around the nearby villages without any reason.\"\"A year ago... After he returned, did he not show any strange behavior in relation to the Awakeners?\"\"It was strange, really. Frankly... I thought the reason he fled to the capital was because that person treated him with such hostility. That person particularly despised those who awakened and gained power.\"\"That's enough for me. Dermilla, I hope you never return to the village. Also, I found this in your burnt house, I'll give it back if you need it.\"Now that he had found the Devran family to be alive, the double brooch picked up from his house had served its purpose. As Yuder showed her the double brooch, Dermilla's mouth gaped open.\"That, that's...\"Yuder gently nodded, indicating that she should take it. Dermilla, her face filled with emotion, carefully accepted the brooch from Yuder's hand. Yuder almost regretted giving it back too quickly, seeing Devran's grave, uncomfortable expression as he watched his sister's joy.\"Now, those who want to leave should go. Remember all the precautions I have told you.\"Yuder whispered a few tasks to Devran, to carry out when he met Gakane and Jimmy. Among them was a message to inform Kishiar of the current situation as soon as he could use the public communication device in the next village.The imprisoned who were released began to make their way out of the cave as soon as they wrung out all the information they had learned while captive and relayed it to Yuder.\"Urgh!... Arrgh!\"\"Grunt!\"'Ah, right. I forgot to talk about the three who fainted on the way out.'Just moments after Devran and the previously imprisoned had disappeared, Yuder was reminded of the small detail he had forgotten as he heard the muffled screams.The Awakeners, having removed the bombs attached to their bodies and gained freedom, overflowed with willpower despite their weakened state.Indeed, the stronger their will, the more powerful the abilities they manifested. Yuder hadn't considered the possibility that they might not escape regardless of their health condition.'Now all that's left is Kiolle da Diarca and...'Yuder turned his head toward Nahan, who had quietly observed his actions.\"The one hidden by illusion, let him out now.\"\"You've found out.\"\"That guy must be the companion you were looking for.\"Yuder had noticed that the number of people Nahan had brought from the prison and the actual number of people in sight were exactly one person off. Since then, Nahan had been overly quiet, as if hiding something.\"Yes, you're right.\"At Yuder's words, Nahan moved his fingers and the dark cave wall next to him peeled away to reveal a boy with a pale face.Yuder was slightly surprised to see that the one Nahan had hidden was so young. The boy seemed about the same age as Jimmy. He was undoubtedly the youngest among those imprisoned.\"You had this young boy purchase all the food and goods for your bandits?\"\"No need for suspicion. This little brother has a power that's optimized for that kind of work.\"Nahan responded with a cold smile to Yuder's gaze, which was as if looking at garbage.\"What kind of power?\"\"The power to make friends.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Despite having traveled back in time, it was the first time he'd heard of such a power. Upon making eye contact with Yuder, the boy quickly hid behind Nahan, as if frightened.\"Yes, since you've found your companion, your objective must be achieved.\"Yuder thought that Nahan would just take his young ally and disappear. If it had been him, he would have done the same. After all, if they missed this moment, they might not have another chance to escape unnoticed.\"True. However, this time, I think I'll follow you to the end.\"Yet, Nahan said something unexpected.\"I don't need a spectator.\"\"I'm an accomplice who has come this far with you. It hurts a bit to be called a spectator.\"What was he thinking? Yuder grew suspicious of Nahan, more than ever before. However, there was no need to unnecessarily increase the number of enemies at this point. Thus, he decided to retreat, keeping a wary eye on Nahan.\"If it becomes a hindrance...\"\"It definitely won't. Just as it hasn't until now.\"Nahan was eloquent, if nothing else. Ignoring him, Yuder headed towards the last remaining prison cell. As he unlocked the door, the man tied up inside with ordinary ropes glared at him, his eyes filled with rage.\"Ugh... uuuhh...\"Of course, it was Kiolle da Diarca, the one left behind until the very end.He tried to yell something, but because of the gag, his words were incomprehensible. Yuder stared at him for a moment before finally speaking.\"Kiolle da Diarca.\"It was a name he'd tried to forget since their first encounter, yet it had eventually etched itself into his memory, which was impressive in its own way.\"I'll remove your gag, but if you scream or make any unnecessary noise that might attract attention, I'll knock you unconscious immediately. Nod if you understand.\"\"Uuuuhhh!!\"Kiolle thrashed about as if telling Yuder to stop spouting nonsense, twisting his head with all his might. It didn't seem like he understood Yuder's words at all.\"Do we really need to save that guy?\"Nahan, who had been watching the whole scene, asked in an indifferent tone.\"He's not a brother or sister who possesses the same power. He doesn't seem extraordinary enough to merit rescue.\"\"Uuuhh!! Uuh!\"Kiolle directed a furious glare at Nahan and yelled at him. Clearly, he didn't appreciate Nahan's words.'Honestly... I can't argue with that.'Would Kiolle even thank him for being rescued? It would be fortunate if he didn't rush at him with fists clenched right away. However, Yuder still thought it was better to prevent his death.Whatever it was, he'd decided to prevent a repeat of the past.'And if he dies here, they might pin Kiolle's death on the Apeto household, drawing the Cavalry's attention.'He had to avoid any situation that could cause harm to the Cavalry at all costs. That's why he had left Kiolle until last.\"If you continue to be uncooperative, there's not much I can do. We don't have much time.\"\"Uh, uuhh! Uuh!!\"\"Don't like it? Should I just leave you here?\"\"Urrgh!\"Kiolle glared at Yuder as if he wanted to tear him apart.\"Then I suggest you keep quiet.\"Yuder did not bother to get Kiolle upright; he simply slid the gag down to his chin, leaving him sprawled on the floor. The instant he did, a voice, brimming with rage, echoed out.\u201cYou, you\u2019re that guy from the Cavalry.\u201dLuckily, he didn\u2019t yell, but the words themselves didn\u2019t feel any less menacing. Kiolle coughed a few times, grinding his teeth and lifting his head, as Yuder watched him silently, offering no response.\u201cYou have no idea how much I\u2019ve been looking forward to seeing you again. You wouldn\u2019t know how humiliating it has been for me, banished to this countryside because of you, being watched over by idiots.\u201d\u201cAre you saying this is all because of me?\u201d\u201cYes! You\u2019ve made a laughingstock out of me with your underhanded tactics, ruining my honor. Even my own father asked me to keep a low profile and train, casting me out. That was a first. No one would listen to me!\u201d\u2018The Duke of Diarca seems to care more for this lad than I thought.\u2019Kiolle vented his frustration about his father, but Yuder interpreted a completely different meaning from his words.Recalling the conversation the underlings had with the Warden of Apeto, Kiolle was likely the youngest child of the Duke of Diarca. In his previous life, Yuder had served an Emperor who was a foster son of the Diarca family, so he knew the Diarca family atmosphere a bit better than other dukedoms.The Diarca family was the epitome of \u2018nobility\u2019. They were tied together only by the family name. There was little affection between family members and relatives.In his previous life, Yuder had encountered the current Duke of Diarca a few times, but his impression was stronger of a cranky old raccoon rather than a human being.The current Duke died of an illness not long after Yuder took his position, but the eldest son who succeeded him as the heir was not much different.The Emperor kept the Diarca family slightly closer due to the bond he had with them when growing up, but he never fully trusted them. The family often described this distance as being noble and very Diarca-like.Under the old Duke of such a Diarca family, the fact that such a free-spirited son came out, and despite causing multiple accidents, he was never properly disciplined but just sent off to train, was frankly quite surprising.\u2018So he's the youngest son, maybe they just doted on him and let him be.\u2019However, Kiolle disappeared early even in the previous life. If he continued to live like this, even if Yuder saved him this time, his future didn't seem like it would change easily.\u201cAre you listening to me? Undo these bonds immediately!\u201dYuder exhaled deeply, facing the shouting Kiolle.\u201cYou... you impudent brat, dare to sigh?\u201d\u201cAnd what will you do once I free you?\u201dKiolle shut his mouth for a moment at the calm question showing no fear of his yelling, then opened it again with a venomous glare.\u201cThe obvious. I\u2019m going to bring you to your knees.\u201d\u201cAnd how, exactly? You're unarmed at the moment.\u201dYuder pointed out Kiolle's empty waistband. Only then did Kiolle seem to remember his weapon being taken away, opening his mouth and looking down at his waistband.\u201c\u2026That, that is. I need to knock down Apeto\u2019s dogs and retrieve it\u2026\u2026.\u201d\"So, what will you do without any weapons?\"\"You guys will do something, right? Didn't I hear clearly that you were going to help the rest of the prisoners escape?\"\"We don't necessarily have to, you know?\"Yuder purposely lied.\"To be honest, I could just leave you here and escape myself.\"\"What, what did you just say? How could you...!\"\"So, what will you do next? Are you planning to defeat all of Apeto Duchy\u2019s people unarmed by yourself?\"\"Yes!\"Kiolle shouted as if in defiance.\"All I need is to beat someone and take their sword! So, let me go!\"\"Is that all you have planned?\"At this point, Yuder stopped using honorifics.\"What?\"\"I asked if that was the extent of your situational judgment, Kiolle Diarca.\"\"You... How dare you, a commoner, question me, a high-ranking Imperial Knight...!\"\"Who's the one who passed out twice because they were weaker than a commoner, and behaved disgracefully due to inability to accept the difference in skill? Look at your state. Is your judgment that poor?\"Kiolle had probably never been spoken to in such a cold manner in his life. He was frozen, lips slightly parted, his face a mix of rage and surprise at the abusive words spouted by a commoner.\"Even with your foolish decisions, you haven't shown any remorse even after losing a comrade's life.\"\"Comrade? Comrade, you say. Who!\"It was then that Kiolle finally started to move, thrashing about as he let out a scream. He managed to sit up, albeit with difficulty. His noble-like demeanor had long since faded from his dirty, earth-covered face as he looked up at Yuder.\"Are you talking about the dead Paviel right now?\"\"Yes.\"\"Did you overhear that from Apeto's dogs on your way here? Ha. That traitor being my comrade is a ridiculous joke. He betrayed me and surrendered to the enemy so he could live. It's natural that he died. How is that my fault?\"\"If it's not your fault, then whose is it?\"Yuder's reply was calm, his gaze frosty.\"He was your comrade. He must have trusted you enough to get to that point. You had countless ways to make better decisions to save your own life and your comrade's. But you didn't. Blinded by anger, you risked everyone's safety, pushing yourself into a life-threatening situation. And still, you say it's not your fault that he died because of you?\"\"Shut up! What do you know! Should I have cared for the one who betrayed me out of fear of death and insulted me? Why should I!\"Kiolle Diarca seemed just like a stubborn child, too full of himself to see what was happening around him. He was not the sort of person who could stand above others and take responsibility. Yuder leaned slightly towards Kiolle, who was gnashing his teeth in anger.\"That's why you have three flowers on your armor. Do you need any other reason?\"Kiolle's expression mixed with anger and confusion as their gazes met.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And I am on the verge of fulfilling that order. It's my duty as the assistant to the Commander of the Cavalry. But what about you?\"\"...\"\"You couldn't protect your subordinate, you put your own life in danger, and you can't even judge the situation correctly, blinded by personal rage, charging at me without thinking again. Is that your role? You claim to be a noble, yet you can't think beyond that? Is it more important to knock me down than considering what is more crucial at this point, or what to do next? What's the use of your head?\"\"What... what......?\"Kiolle's eyes and lips were trembling.\"Whether a noble or a commoner, death is the end for both. Stab either, and the same red blood comes out. How significant do you think lineage is here?\"\"You...\"Finally, as if Kiolle understood something, he swallowed his words and closed his mouth.\"So, you had no intention of saving me. So... that's why you left me till the end\u2026 to take revenge on me...\"'What would I gain by taking revenge on you.'However, his frightened look wasn't bad. Yuder didn't bother to correct his misunderstanding and opened his cold mouth, keeping his eyes straight.\"Convince me why I should save you. If you fail to do so, you'll die here, Kiolle.\"\"Me? Convince? You?\"Kiolle, with wide-open eyes, asked back with a dumbfounded face.\"Yes.\"\"So, you won't kill me? Really?\"\"If you can convince me properly.\"\"Ha...... Haha.\"Perhaps it was a joke. His eyes, implying such a meaning, stared at Yuder. But as time passed and he saw Yuder patiently waiting, his expression slowly distorted.'He must have never had to contemplate whether to live or die until now.'He must not be so stupid as to prefer dying rather than trying to persuade Yuder in this situation. At least, Yuder wanted to believe that.Yuder keenly observed Kiolle's changing expressions, which were interestingly diverse. Doubt and confusion, a sliver of hope, and the stubborn pride named self-esteem struggling within, anger and pain, and... all of these gradually crumbling, leaving behind only one emotion.\"...If you let me out of here, then, yes. My father... will reward you.\"At last, the first words Kiolle managed to say were just as Yuder expected.\"Rejected.\"\"Why?\"As soon as Yuder shook his head, Kiolle shouted in anger with a flushed face.\"Why? Because it's unnecessary. Next.\"\"Unnecessary? This is the Diarca Family! We're talking about the reward of Diarca! Commoners like you die for money! What else do you need? Treasure? Would jewelry do? Or maybe a sword? Do you want a fine horse?\"\"I don't care whether it's money, jewelry, or treasure. I don't need any material things. Convince me with something else.\"\"Damn it! Then... a position. I'll give you a position. Would a regular knight position in the Imperial Knight do?\"\"Rejected.\"Why would he care about the Imperial Knight, which would become an insignificant group a few years later? Yuder frowned and shook his head without a second thought. Over Kiolle's face, anger and worry mixed and rippled.\"Ah, very well. I'll speak to my father and request him to promote you to the position of Cavalry Commander. It won't be immediate, but it should be satisfactory to you.\"Cavalry Commander? Yuder nearly laughed out loud. Besides it being the most absurd proposal Kiolle had made so far, it was preposterous that a mere one of the countless children of the Diarca ducal house, not even an heir, would so lightly suggest such a position.'It shows how much regard the Diarca House has for the Cavalry.'Feeling fortunate that Kishiar was not present, Yuder responded coldly.\"How many times do I have to tell you that I'm not interested in anything related to status or power?\"\"Damn you, then what else could you possibly want!\"\"Do you always need to give something to persuade someone, is that it? Besides, you don't have the power to give anything you've mentioned yourself. That's not persuasion.\"For a moment, Kiolle's expression was as if he had heard something he had never contemplated in his life.\"What I demanded was for you to provide a reason for your survival here. Not pointless wealth or status. Can't you even offer that simple thing? Do you truly believe that you're superior to the dead when you can't?\"At least Kiolle's dead subordinate knew when to kneel before his enemies in order to survive. Of course, it wasn't a good method. It led to his death, after all. But at least he was better than the current Kiolle.\"...\"\"The reason why everyone here has spared you is not because you're great, but because they simply wanted to know about your lineage. Apart from that, there's currently no reason for you to live. Why should I go to the trouble of saving you, who is destined to die anyway? Would you want to save someone who insults and annoys you?\"Yuder watched Kiolle, his face pale as if he had taken a blow to the head, struggling for breath with his mouth wide open. No one had ever spoken to him like this before. It was assumed he should be treated with special deference simply because he was a son of the Diarca family.'But I'll make him admit that it's not taken for granted.'After all, Kiolle had to be saved and sent away from here. Then, at least this much should be corrected to make his life worth saving. It was worth the effort for the sake of future matters.\"Ha, but, the other prisoners. They were just saved... why only me....\"Whether he was convinced within Yuder's cold gaze that his status or ability held no meaning in the current situation, Kiolle's voice faded. He was experiencing the feeling of being fundamentally denied for the first time in his life.There had been countless people who had criticized and looked down on him, but they had never been able to ignore his noble status and the name Diarca.His status and power were the strongest armor that had supported Kiolle de Diarca. But now, with that armor gone, Kiolle was swallowed up by an indescribable fear and emptiness.\"They were innocent imperial citizens who were imprisoned simply because they awakened some power. Of course they should be saved.\"\"So, are you saying that I'm worse than those commoners?\"\"Worse.\"Yuder replied firmly.\"Even after being defeated twice, you still refuse to acknowledge your weakness and continue to pointlessly brandish your sword. How could you be the same as those who understand gratitude? Even a beast knows to lower its tail before a stronger foe. Unlike you.\"\"You, dare, to compare me, to a beast...\"Stammering with shock, Kiolle's face had turned as white as a sheet. From the look on his face, it seemed he was on the verge of fainting.\"Fine, fine. It doesn't matter if you don't want to save me. They can't kill me anyway. If I just wait, my father will surely come to rescue me!\"\"Really, will he?\"At the soft question, Kiolle's face contorted.\"No one knows you're missing right now. The knights who came with you for the training aren't even looking for you, so how would your father know? There's plenty of time for these guys here to kill you and bury your body.\"\"What...\"\"There will be no change even if you die, Kiolle. The death of a non-heir during a training accident wouldn't be surprising. Even if the perpetrator is revealed, the noble families won't feud over it. It's just that simple.\"\u2018You are, simply that insignificant.\u2019\"Ah...\"At the cold declaration, Kiolle's ragged breathing stopped completely. Even if he was foolish, he was a member of a noble family, and he would've realized that Yuder's words were accurate. The words were true, so he couldn't argue against them.It seemed like he finally grasped the reality before his eyes, unable to express his anger. Yuder looked at Kiolle's face, sensing that he had finally made a dent in his stubborn obstinacy.\"Well, if you want to die, I won't stop you. Is our conversation over?\"\"...\"\"Alright. It seems there's nothing more to say...\"\"...Wait, wait.\"Kiolle urgently called Yuder.\"I, get it. You're, you're stronger than me. I admit... I'll admit it. I'll, I'll apologize too.\"Yuder, who was about to turn away, stopped his movement. To hold onto him, Kiolle struggled with all his might, trying to lift his head.\"If calling you a commoner made you angry, I take it back. If you let me out of here... I promise I'll never challenge you to a duel again. If you ask me to, I'll do anything I can!\"His bound hands gripped Yuder's robe tightly.\"So please, save me. I don't want to die here...\"Finally, the answer he wanted had come out.Yet, Yuder didn't show his satisfaction on his face and instead slowly bent down to sit.\"You'll do anything?\"\"Yes, anything.\"\"Even if I ask you to betray your family and the Imperial Knight?\"\"...\"At that moment, Kiolle's eyes froze over.'Well, well, he's scared. Truly a child.'Yuder looked down at him and shook his head.\"Of course, I don't have that intention. You're not competent enough for such a task.\"\"You, you bastard... You're making a fool of me...!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course, his gaze soon diminished like a small flame extinguishing in front of a chill breeze before Yuder's direct stare.\"Admission, apology, and a declaration to do anything. All three are the best things you've said so far. Not a bad persuasion.\"At Yuder's words, Kiolle managed to express a bit of hope. But Yuder soon replied with a cold look on his face.\"But why should I believe you?\"\"What?\"\"Anyone can say words. How can I trust the sincerity of your words? If you deny ever saying such things once we leave here, that would be the end of it.\"\"Damn it. Then what, what do you want me to do? Take a knight's oath here?\"\"An oath is too weak.\"\"Then what do you want me to do?\"Kiolle had no clue what Yuder was asking of him. Watching Kiolle\u2019s puzzled face, Yuder's lips curled into a slight smile.\"Alright. I'll find a way to definitely trust your persuasion. Wait here a little.\"\"What? Wait a minute. You have to free me first!\"Kiolle, surprised, desperately grabbed at Yuder's hem, but to no avail. Yuder easily freed his hand, stood up from his place, and brushed off his hem.\"It'll only be a moment. You won't die in that time, so don't worry and keep your mouth shut.\"\"What? No. You said you'd help me! Wait! Hey! Where are you going!\"Despite his defeated situation, Kiolle was indeed Kiolle. Yuder, who was about to turn away, stopped and bent over towards him.Despite calling out first, Kiolle sealed his lips when Yuder approached, his face slightly scared.'Scared, indeed.'Yuder grabbed the gag hanging around Kiolle's neck and lifted it back up.\u201cGah-!!\u201dKiolle widened his eyes, thrashing about, shaking his head. He had experienced all kinds of humiliations and thought he had found a way to survive, but felt like he was rolling back into hell again. His desperate demeanor was understandable.'But one should know when to trust a person\u2019s word.'\"If you said you would do anything, then first learn to quietly wait.\"\"Grrgghh! Urgghh!\"\"I\u2019m going.\"Yuder left the cell where Kiolle was trapped. Then he waited for Nahan and the young boy to come out, before closing and locking the door again. The muffled sounds of Kiolle could be heard from inside, but no one paid any attention.\"He will never keep his promise.\"Nahan stated coldly, a blank expression on his face.\"I know.\"\"But how are you going to make him keep it?\"\"I told you, I'm going to find a way.\"Yuder replied lightly, striding forward. It wasn't long before the sight of three incapacitated Awakeners revealed themselves. They had been knocked unconscious by only throwing stones without a single injury when they arrived, but their current condition was a total mess. It was clear who had done it.'Devran and the others seem to have been quite tormented.'Yuder used the power of wind to lift them and distributed them into any open cell, then resumed his stride. His destination was the crossroads he had seen earlier.He had headed towards the prison before, but this time, he had to go in the opposite direction. The final goal of the day should be there.\"Aha.\"Only then did Nahan, who had been following Yuder, nodded his head as if he had guessed something.\"Indeed. There must be a way.\"Not long after, the road gradually widened, and small voices began to echo from the inside. Judging by the calmness in the voices, they seemed to have not yet noticed what was happening outside.'It means Devran and the prisoners have taken care of the ones they ran into.'Yuder continued towards those who couldn't even imagine the silently approaching shadow of misfortune.------\"...They're late.\"\"Hmm?\"\"What is it? Are you already awake, Jimmy?\"After returning to the castle as Yuder had instructed, Gakane, who had been looking out the window, sitting next to Jimmy who lay in bed, turned his head in surprise.Feeling somewhat sorry that his murmured words, not intended for the ears of a sleeping boy, had elicited a response, he asked, \"Did you wake up because of me?\"\"No, I had a good sleep... I woke up quickly. But what do you mean it's late?\"The boy's cheeks, which had been slightly feverish before bed, were now back to their usual clear complexion.Gakane didn't notice the peculiar scent that those on the verge of a second gender manifestation exuded, but just to be sure, he lightly touched and then pulled his hand away from Jimmy's forehead. There was no fever.\"Well... no. I just think Yuder is later than I expected.\"\"Yuder?\"Jimmy, who had just woken up, sat up, rubbing his sleep-filled eyes. A steadily sinking sun was visible through the large window next to the bed. The crimson sunset was beautiful, but it was difficult to think so when he looked at the burnt black buildings beneath it.Jimmy, turning his worried gaze towards Gakane who was looking out the window, said, \"True\u2026 I thought he'd be back before sunset. But if something had happened to Yuder, he would've sent a signal as promised. Don't worry too much, Gakane.\"Looking at Jimmy, who offered his consolation in a somewhat calm and dignified manner, Gakane managed a wry smile.\"That's true. Anyway, it's good you're awake. I was actually about to go out and check around.\"\"Outside... Ah. To check on that man Zakail?\"\"Yeah. Earlier when you were sleeping, I went out on the pretext of getting water and got a feel for the situation. It seemed Zakail wasn't in the castle.\"\"He wasn't? Where could he have gone?\"\"I don't know that. He might be back by now, so I want to go check again.\"\"Wow. I want to come too.\"Jimmy's eyes sparkled as he tried to get out of bed. Gakane put out his hand, pressing down on the boy's round head to make him sit back down, shaking his head.\"You can't.\"\"Why!\"\"People here think you're lying down because your body isn't in good shape after the long journey. The best way to scout around without arousing suspicion is for me to go out, pretending to fetch necessary items like water or towels while looking after you.\"Unable to find a rebuttal to Gakane's reasonable response, Jimmy pouted his lips, looking disappointed.\"...Then hurry back. I'll be here.\"\"Right. But it's also important to keep an eye on the outside, so you need to keep watch until I return. If by any chance you see Yuder send up flames or any other signal, run straight to me.\"\"I understand.\"Gakane rose from his seat, looking at Jimmy, who promptly nodded with a determined expression. Jimmy was more calm and smart in judging the situation than his peers, so he could be relied on to handle things properly. Now Gakane had his own work to do.Not long after Gakane stepped outside the room, maids appeared across the hallway, murmuring and chatting among themselves.They had an air of discomfort around the unwelcome guests in the castle, but Gakane did not let their attitude affect him. He greeted them warmly and approached them first.\"Hello. Could I possibly get a towel?\"\"A towel? Why do you ask?\"An older maid asked, eyeing him suspiciously.\"One of our little companions isn't feeling well. He has a fever, and we need a wet towel.\"\"The little one... are you talking about the little brown-haired child that was with you?\"\"Yes. Poor thing, he seems to have overdone it moving such a great distance so quickly. There's not much we can do; he's still a child.\"While the Easterners seemed to dislike the Awakeners, they felt sympathetic toward Jimmy, who was still a child.The maid, old enough to have children of Jimmy's age, exchanged sympathetic glances. The previously tense atmosphere softened instantly. Everything was going according to Gakane's plan.\"I'll bring one, so wait here for a moment.\"\"Thank you. You're really kind.\"After all, how many could resist a handsome young man with a strikingly beautiful face speaking softly with a smile?Gakane was well aware that his looks played in his favor when it came to people's favor, and he utilized this to the fullest to lower the maids' guard.By the time the maid returned with the towel, he had naturally obtained most of the information he could get from them.\"Jimmy. I'm back. Any issues?\"\"No. Did Zakail return?\"Jimmy, who was watching outside the window, swiftly turned around. Gakane nodded, placing the newly acquired towel on the table.\"Yes. He left and returned within an hour.\"\"So, he just met someone from the village?\"\"No, that's not it. Zakail has been going out alone from the castle and returning from time to time since a year ago. But the people he met were suspicious. He's often been seen meeting unfamiliar hunters that people have never seen around here. The former lord was quite worried about it.\"\"Hunters, you say....\"\"I don't know their identities. But I got another interesting piece of information.\"\"What's that?\"\"Devran's younger sister had a deep relationship with Zakail's elder brother. Not long ago, Zakail told the late lord about this. The lord got angry, confined Devran's sister in the castle, and then Devran, who was on leave, seems to have come here.\"Jimmy couldn't hide his surprised look as Gakane casually spilled out all the deep information he hadn't been able to gather while roaming around the village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Wow. Did people really tell you all that? Folks we met outside didn't even bother to say a word. How on earth did you manage it?\"\"It's different when a group of men in black uniforms come asking questions and when one person approaches in a non-threatening manner.\"Gakane chuckled as he plopped down on a chair near the bed.\"At any rate, you have a sense of what's happening now, right?\"\"I think the reason Devran disappeared must be due to Zakail.\"Hearing Jimmy's deduction, Gakane's eyes softened.\"That's what I'm thinking too. When Yuder returns, let's confront Zakail directly.\"\"Sounds good.\"Gakane and Jimmy's gazes met, holding mutual understanding as they both lapsed into silence. Jimmy couldn't hide his admiration for Gakane as he let out a small sigh.\"Gakane, you said you're an Alpha, right?\"\"Alpha? Yeah, that's right.\"\"I'm envious.\"At the sudden expression of envy, Gakane blinked quickly, his face a picture of surprise.\"What of?\"\"I heard from others in the Cavalry... they said that if you manifested a second gender, you suddenly grow much taller. Were you like that?\"\"Height?\"Gakane repeated, perplexed. This was the most peculiar question he'd encountered since revealing his second gender as Alpha.\"Well, not really... My height didn't change much from before I awakened. I'm not sure.\"\"I heard that Ever, who joined the Cavalry not long ago, is still growing after her awakening. And the commander is really tall.\"\"The Commander... yeah, that's true.\"Gakane contemplated, recalling the figure of Commander Kishiar. While Gakane himself was tall enough to stand out among average men, Kishiar was physically remarkable.Normally, extremely tall individuals tended to appear clumsy, but Kishiar's physique was as perfect as if it were sculpted by a god, only evoking a sense of overwhelming awe.Although Gakane still often found it difficult to fully realize the fact that he had manifested a second gender, the Commander had the power to make even such an unusual fact seem utterly natural.It felt as if Kishiar's second gender manifestation was an extraordinary blessing in itself.Gakane remembered the immense and overpowering aura of Alpha he felt when he first saw Kishiar on the podium. He had met quite a few comrades who had manifested as Alphas afterward, but none were like Kishiar. He was that kind of being.\"The Commander is of imperial lineage, so he probably had that physique from the start. Most likely.\"\"Really?\"\"Jimmy, do you want your second gender to manifest?\"Gakane carefully addressed Jimmy, who then nodded with a gloomy face.\"Why? You'll grow taller as time goes by.\"The boy, whose eyes were hesitant about whether he should speak up, faltered for a moment before opening his mouth.\"I think my parents are overly worried because I'm young. But I don't want it to manifest just yet... I don't want it to hinder our mission.\"\"Your parents? Oh, you said they live nearby. Didn't you visit them during the recent holiday?\"At Gakane's question, Jimmy shook his head.\"I had been staying at the house of my father's friend who lives in the capital. My parents had asked me to.\"\"Why... Ah.\"Gakane, who had been about to ask why, recalled the words spoken to him by the bandit chief who had introduced himself as Nahan and faltered. As if Jimmy knew what Gakane was thinking, his gaze darkened.\"My parents told me that because the shop is very busy, even if I take a sudden vacation like this, I might not get to see them. I thought they were telling the truth... but thinking about it now, I guess they weren't. When I sent them a letter, my mother told me that the next time we meet, it would be when they came up to the capital for business. I guess they didn't want me to come back to my hometown.\"In the South, where Gakane lived, the atmosphere wasn't particularly hostile towards the Awakeners, so it wasn't easy to find words of comfort for Jimmy.Gakane hesitated, then decided to give him some honest advice while stroking the boy's head.\"Just because you exhibit a second gender manifestation doesn't mean you have to grow taller, and just because you get bigger doesn't mean you become an adult. Your parents are wise people, they'll surely be okay. So don't worry, and if you're truly concerned, talk to the Commander or Yuder. They'll definitely help you. Ah, and of course, I will as well. How about we stop by your village on our way back?\"\"That's okay.\"\"Don't you want to see your parents? Didn't you say it's only a few hours from here? A slight change in schedule shouldn't be too much trouble, so tell me honestly.\"\"No, really, I'm totally fine.\"Jimmy, who quickly shook his head, looked up at Gakane with an awkward smile after a moment.\"Thank you for not saying that my worries are too childish, Gakane.\"\"You can act more like a child if you want. It would've been nice if my siblings were even half as mature as you.\"As Gakane deliberately sighed deeply, Jimmy's eyes widened in surprise at his unexpected words.\"You have siblings?\"\"Yeah, I have five of them.\"\"Wow! I'm an only child, so I've never known what it's like to have siblings.\"\"It's not as great as you think. It's incredibly noisy, and they fight all the time. There's never a moment of peace.\"Gakane thought about his younger siblings who would be at home by now. He hadn't seen their familiar faces this vacation, but he was okay because he knew he would see them eventually.\"That sounds like the Cavalry's atmosphere.\"At Jimmy's words, Gakane chuckled.\"Indeed, it's not so different from the Cavalry.\"\"I wonder what Yuder is like? Does Yuder have any siblings?\"\"Yuder?\"\"You know, right? You're the closest with Yuder.\"The conversation had suddenly veered towards Yuder, but seeing Jimmy's sparkling eyes, Gakane soon acquiesced.Throughout this mission, Jimmy had been completely enthralled by Yuder's strong appearance. It seemed natural to want to know more about Yuder, given his behaviour, which was much like a puppy following its master.'Closest with Yuder... I'm grateful if that's how it seems.'Gakane honestly wasn't sure if they were as close as it seemed. In Gakane's eyes, Yuder was a mysterious figure with deep eyes that made it hard to guess his age.Yuder hardly ever spoke about himself, and he was extremely reticent, always appearing like a solitary figure amongst the crowd.Despite this, it was strangely inevitable that he attracted other people's attention, possessing an overwhelming strength. It was only natural that he first earned the admiration and envy of others.Of course, it changed after it was known that he was a considerate person who didn't hesitate to risk danger for the sake of the Cavalry. But still, Yuder was a mysterious person.Despite being of humble origin, he had no hesitation in leading others, his power was so strong it was terrifying to even question the extent of his abilities. Could such power really come from a young man who was only 20 years old?If Kishiar La Orr was someone who felt like a being above humans created by the gods from birth, then Yuder was different in another way. Yuder Aile was essentially a manifestation of the 'strength' that Gakane had long desired.Because of this, Gakane was fascinated and held a strong interest in Yuder.Although Yuder didn't seem to show more interest in Gakane than he did in others, it seemed like he didn't dislike him either, and that was fine. Gakane considered himself to be quite persistent.\"Yuder probably doesn't have any siblings. That's what I've heard.\"\"I see. There is a similarity between Yuder and me.\"Jimmy, who was smiling happily, suddenly looked out of the window and then suddenly got up.\"Eh? Gakane, over there\u2026 People are coming out and pointing at something?\"\"What?\"Gakane also immediately got up from his seat and headed towards the window. Just as Jimmy had said, the villagers of Hartan, who had been going about their business all day, were gathered around the castle pointing and looking at something.Gakane realized that their gazes were not directed at the castle but something beyond it and felt an odd sensation.'Could it be?'At that moment, someone pounded fiercely on the door of the room they were in.\"Is anyone in there?\"\"What's the matter?\"\"A fire. A big fire has started in the back mountain! It's similar to the one Devran caused!\"The one who was pounding the door was a young servant. Seeing his terrified face, Gakane rushed out of the room.From the window of their room, they could look down on the village, but they couldn't see the mountain on the opposite side of the castle. When they went out to the corridor and looked out the opposite window, there indeed was a massive pillar of fire shooting up from the mountain.Seeing the maids and servants from the castle all gathered together trembling in fear, Gakane grabbed one of them and asked.\"When did that fire start?\"\"J-, Just now.\"\"Where is Lord Zakail now?\"\"He's gone out with the guards!\"The fact that Zakail had gone out with the guards meant that he too hadn't anticipated this situation. Gakane said he understood and turned to look at Jimmy who had followed him.\"Jimmy. Let's go.\"\"Do you think that fire is a signal from Yuder?\"Jimmy asked in a voice so soft that only Gakane could hear.\"I'm not sure yet. But it's clear that something has happened. Did you bring your practice sword?\"\"Yes.\"Jimmy showed the small practice sword he had on his waist with a stern face.\"Good. Come here.\"Gakane lifted Jimmy with one hand and summoned his shadow clone. The servants who saw the black shadow rising from beneath his feet started screaming and running away.\"It's a monster!\"\"A monster, huh? That's harsh.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"A monster, huh? That's harsh.\"Gakane grumbled lightly, maneuvering his shadow clone. The shadow clone, carrying the lightweight Gakane who held Jimmy, hurtled fearlessly towards the open window.\"Ah!\"Jimmy screamed at the sensation of falling, but what followed the thud wasn't pain or shock. The shadow clone carrying them had landed on the ground as gently as a whisper.\"Gakane, next time give me a heads up before doing something like that!\"\"Sorry. I forgot in the rush.\"Gakane had learned during his hellish training with Yuder that such feats were possible with his shadow clone. The shadow clone, being almost impervious to the shock of falling from great heights, proved to be a far better mode of descent from a tall castle than physically scaling it down.\"Let's run.\"They raced breathlessly towards the hill behind the castle. The hill was quite large and deep, but it wasn't difficult to locate the column of fire visible even from within the castle.When they finally arrived at the source of the fire, the scene that Gakane and Jimmy encountered was of two groups standing off against each other.One side consisted mostly of injured individuals in tattered clothes, while the other side was made up of well-armored guards led by a young nobleman, all armed and ready for battle.The two groups, weapons drawn and poised for battle, suddenly halted upon spotting Gakane and Jimmy. The first to welcome them was a burly man from the injured group.\"You're Jimmy, aren't you? Of course! And the one with you must be Gakane!\"\"De, Devran? What happened to your face!\"Jimmy exclaimed in shock at the sight of Devran, whose face was unrecognizable due to the numerous wounds. However, Devran just smiled broadly.\"A small price to pay for survival! I'm fine. In fact, I'm feeling great right now. Hahaha.\"\"Devran! Where have you been all this time? And who are these people with you?\"At Gakane's shout, Devran pointed at the guardsmen, their weapons aimed at him.\"That despicable noble tried to frame and sell me out. These friends next to me were captured for the same reason. They're all Awakeners. And these here are my family.\"\"Family?\"Just as Devran said, a man resembling him, an older man, and a young woman supporting him stood by his side. It was easy to guess from their faces alone that the three were family.'So the family Devran was said to have killed was alive all along. Then that means...'As Gakane's gaze shifted towards Zakail, who stood behind the guards, Zakail, his eyes burning with rage, shouted loudly.\"Do you believe that? It's all lies!\"\"But Lord Zakail....\"The guardsmen, who were holding their weapons aimed at Devran, his family, and the escaped Awakeners at Zakail's command, had expressions of utter despair.Even if they ostracized the Awakeners, these were people who had lived as neighbors in a small village for a long time. Contrary to Zakail's words, they knew perfectly well that the people in front of them were the real Devran and his family.\"If Devran didn't kill his family, then perhaps he didn't start the fire either. Since he has returned, at the very least, we should hear what happened....\"One of the guards aiming his spear murmured in a low voice. His words might have seemed reasonable to anyone else, but not to Zakail. Enraged, Zakail unsheathed the sword he'd brought with him and pointed it at the guard's neck, yelling furiously.\"Trying to sympathize with a murderer, you're no doubt a criminal too!\"\"No, that's not it!\"The guard, his throat at the tip of Zakail's sword, turned pale and bowed his head.\"I have nothing to say to the bastard who killed my father and sister! Arrest those scoundrels now!\"\"Uh\u2026 understood.\"However, the guards couldn't muster the courage to step forward. They were paralyzed with fear, staring at Devran who was stirring up a storm, and the Awakeners standing next to him, showcasing their powers as if to make a point. The tension between the two sides intensified.And Gakane, who had assessed the situation up until then, acted swiftly and concisely.\"Devran. Need some help?\"Standing between the two groups, Gakane spoke softly to Devran, drawing everyone's attention.\"It seems like you guys don't really want to fight, and we just need to deal with this young master. Isn't that right?\"\"That's true, but what do you plan on doing?\"Devran asked with a puzzled look.\"Just this.\"\"What are those guys talking about\u2026! Ack!\"Zakail, who had been watching Gakane and Devran's conversation with a stupefied look, suddenly screamed. Gakane's shadow clone, which had quietly extended to right behind Zakail during their confrontation, abruptly rose, gripping Zakail by the collar and lifting him off the ground.\"Ugh! What is this monster! Let me go! I said let me go!\"\"Master Zakail!\"The guards, who had only been on alert against Devran and the Awakeners, spun around in a panic. But no one dared approach the flailing Zakail who was now suspended in mid-air.Seizing this opportunity, Jimmy, moving towards Gakane's shadow clone, unsheathed his sword. His energy, appearing like a blue blade, was aimed at Zakail's face, causing the screams of terror to grow louder.\"Th-that sword energy! From such a kid!\"\"That child, don't tell me he's the nearby Awakener\u2026!\"\"Now, Young Master. Tell your guards to step back and let's have a chat, shall we?\"While holding the terrified Zakail in the shadow clone's grip, Gakane flashed a gentle smile. That smile, to the eyes of the guards and Zakail, looked devilish.\"If you refuse, you'll get to see Jimmy's sword skills. Aren't you curious about how far he can go with that? Just a graze can slice off a limb, they say.\"\"Ah, ah\u2026!\"All those present, who were just ordinary people who had never even seen a Swordmaster or a knight who could handle aura in their lifetime, were completely shaken. The sword energy Jimmy displayed before these guards was akin to a calamity. Zakail, who had secretly scorned these people dispatched from the Cavalry, felt the same.Staring at the quivering sword energy close to his face, Zakail gritted his teeth and managed to open his trembling lips to speak.\"E-everyone, step back.\"\"But, Young Master!\"\"Step back if I tell you to step back! Or do you want to die in my stead!\"Responding to the harsh call, the guards began to reluctantly step back. Only when they had retreated far enough that they could barely hear the conversation taking place did Gakane gesture to Jimmy to sheathe his sword.Then, at last, Devran extinguished the enormous pillar of fire that still raged. Unlike the traces of fire that had blackened the entire village, there was no sign left where Devran's fire had been extinguished.\"So, the remnants of the fire in the village weren't your doing. Right?\"\"Of course not.\"Devran, who had briskly answered Gakane's question, glared at Zakail as he moved closer to Gakane.\"What on earth happened? Escaping all the way here and suddenly starting a fire, what was that all about?\"\"I just did as Yuder ordered. He saved us all. He said to go out and start a fire so you guys would get the signal and call you out.\"\"Yuder?\"Gakane, whose eyes widened slightly, then examined the faces of those behind Devran. But he could not find the familiar face.\"But why can't I see Yuder?\"\"That guy said he had things to do and let us go first. I think he plans to come after he takes out all those damned bastards over there.\"Gakane was about to ask who those damned bastards Devran spat out with a face full of hatred were, but he refrained. It was a fact that would be known when Yuder returned.\"So, the guy who was with Yuder stayed too?\"\"There was one stranger I've never seen before.\"\"Okay. Is Yuder's message just to join us?\"\"No. He said to immediately inform the Commander about what happened here, and to return the way we came from Hartan.\"\"...Escape?\"To go back the way they came. When and where was Yuder planning to join them? Gakane was slightly worried, but he decided to trust Yuder's abilities and judgement.With Yuder not here, he would have to move everyone including Devran. There was no time to waste.\"Alright. If the Commander\u2019s assistant said so, we should follow his command. All of you, we will need to move quite a bit, are you all okay?\"At Gakane's question, the Awakeners behind all shouted out in unison that they were fine. Although they were all injured like Devran, their faces were incredibly bright. Since Yuder had saved them, their faith in the Cavalry seemed to pierce the sky.However, only Zakail, who was tightly grasping Gakane's shadow clone, couldn't rejoice. He quickly realized that a very bad situation was occurring as he listened to the ongoing conversation.Devran, who had been sent to Apeto's Family due to their interest, had safely escaped, and the one who saved them was apparently going to finish things up there.It sounded absurd, but with the prisoners alive right before his eyes, there was no choice but to believe.\u2018Damn Apeto bastards. After acting so confidently, what on earth did you do!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91Devran, who should have been dead to atone for all his sins, couldn't be allowed to live. The same was true for the people of the Apeto family who had joined hands with him and orchestrated all these events. If it were revealed that Zakail had joined hands with them to seize the Lordship, he could never be forgiven.Even though he hadn't yet inherited the Lordship, with the success of everything right before his eyes, he didn't anticipate such a turn of events. Although his mind was reeling, only the thought of escaping by any means necessary propelled Zakail to act unabashedly.\"How dare you plot in front of me, the Lord of Hartan? Escape? Report? This is absurd. I will contact His Grace, the Duke of Peletta, your immediate master, right away. I will ask him to grant me permission to execute the person who killed my father and sister and is now roaming around with a calm face...!\"\"Did I kill the Lord and the others?\"The one who responded to Zakail's words was Devran. He couldn't help but let out a genuine laugh, as if the suggestion was absurd. However, the laughter that burst from his face, covered in bruises and wounds, looked monstrous, causing Zakail to involuntarily recoil in fear.\"So... so, didn't you! By starting a great fire!\"\"Why would I?\"Devran asked back with a twisted smile. His eyes were full of hatred, but his voice was eerily calm, making Zakail shiver even more.\"What?\"\"Why would I do that, huh? No matter how much I think about it, there's no reason, right? I left my hometown, joined the Cavalry, received a holy order from the emperor himself, and made a lot of money. I was on the path to success. Why would I risk all that? Doesn't that seem absurd to you, too?\"\"How should I know? People like you get a little power and start getting ideas above their station, and perhaps in your arrogance, you started the fire! Because of you, I didn't even hear my father's and sister's last words!\"\"So, you're blaming me with lies until the very end.\"\"So, are you saying that I, who wasn't in Hartan at that time, started the fire?\"\"Ha, that's a good point. Let's discuss that, shall we?\"Looking into Devran's piercing eyes, Zakail managed to keep his unease at bay.'What's this? Does he have some kind of proof? No. These guys don't know anything yet. I left no solid evidence that I was in league with the Apeto family. Even if they heard something when they were caught, words alone can't serve as evidence.'As Zakail rolled his eyes, Devran opened his mouth.\"The guys who captured me grumbled that taking over a small place like Hartan wouldn't mean much and that they'd done too much for what they got. They even said that without me as a payoff, the deal wouldn't have been worthwhile. That means someone joined hands with them, took Hartan, and handed me over as compensation. Who else could be the culprit if not you, Zakail Hartan, considering the Lord and the heir, Zupiel, have passed?\"\"...\"\"Or could it be Zachlis, who has already received his knighthood and started a new life? None of them had any reason to do so. But you, Zakail Hartan, you had a reason! Can you swear before God that you didn't commit all these atrocities just to become the Lord of Hartan?\"Devran's resonant voice was so loud that even the guards standing far away could easily hear their conversation. Zakail gritted his teeth as he heard the murmuring voices from afar.\"After the fire, you didn't listen to a word I said. You immediately framed me as the culprit, locked me in prison, then buried me alive in front of the Rock of Death, didn't you?\" Devran accused.\"No!\"Zakail yelled, his body convulsing as if in a seizure. But no matter how much he struggled, the black shadow clone that firmly held him didn't so much as flinch.\"I heard that you had committed suicide in prison, so I simply ordered you to be buried quietly!\"\"Whom did you tell this to?\"The one who retorted to Zakail was a handsome man with auburn hair and striking features. The man in a well-fitted black uniform looked down at Zakail with eyes sparkling with amusement as he asked again.\"To whom did you give this order, Zakail? If we can find this person, the truth will be revealed. Right, Devran?\"\"Right. I couldn't know who took me that day as I was hooded, unable to see.\"'You, you brats.'Zakail suddenly realized that he had fallen into a trap. Of course, he never gave such an order. The ones who had taken Devran from the prison, buried him, and then dug him up again, were the people from the Apeto family who had disguised themselves as hunters and hidden after negotiating everything in advance with Zakail.Zakail had personally opened the door leading to the prison so that they could fulfill their purpose quietly under the cover of the pre-dawn darkness without anyone noticing.To divert the attention of his older brother Zachlis, who came rushing upon hearing the news of their father and sister's death, and the village people, he spent all day preparing for the funeral in the back hill, purposely dragging out the time.As he expected, no one cared about the missing Devran. They all believed that Devran had killed his family and set fire to the castle.Who could suspect that Zakail, who was faithfully playing the naive youngest son who knew nothing, was lying? Zachlis, busy with knightly duties, was shell-shocked upon hearing the news of his lover's death and was spaced out throughout the funeral.Although he had said that he would deal with inheritance matters when he returned to the Knights Order, Zakail didn't doubt that his brother would not desire to inherit the title of lord of the village.Aside from the fact that the promising future of a knight was brighter than the petty lordship of a small village, he calculated that his overly sentimental brother wouldn't want to return to the village where his lover died.If that happened, Zakail would have become the lord as planned, gaining the protection of Apeto instead of the Diarca family, who hadn't done anything for him, and would have grown stronger. He had big dreams of starting as the insignificant youngest son of a small village lord and ultimately becoming the winner in the east.Zakail bit his lower lip hard enough to bleed as he thought about that dream. He couldn't afford to be tripped up here because of those commoners.'Let's not interfere. Getting angry won't benefit me. Bowing my head to those commoners is humiliating, but I need to reassure them and survive.'\"I really can't remember who I gave such an order to, as there wasn't enough context.\"\"You're only saying that now...!\"\"Father and older brother are gone. Do you think there would be any danger if it were you? Yes, perhaps. Who knows if those men who claimed to have captured you had deceived me and taken you instead. Right?\"\"What?\"Zakail managed to force a smile to match Devran's brazenness.\"Listen, I'm not sure who planted this ludicrous idea in your head, but it wasn't me who captured you. Think about it. I'm a victim too. All I did was order a proper burial upon hearing news of your death, and here we are. Shouldn't vengeance be first sought from those who captured you? Right?\"\"...\"\"Free me now. If you do, I will forgive all the insolence you have shown me and, as the current representative of the lord of Hartan, I will happily assist you. I'll contact the capital to help find the real culprit. Persisting in hounding me in this manner won't do you any good.\"Devran, and everyone else present, were taken aback by Zakail, who was trying to persuade people with sheer audacity despite having no evidence. His audacity was truly formidable.'He probably won't admit anything without evidence. I suppose I should just do what I need to do before he can further manipulate the situation.'\"Devran. We need to send a letter, let's return to the castle for now.\"\"Can't we just kill him?\"Despite facing his mortal enemy, Devran, who was unable to lift a finger, muttered with a scowl. At Devran's grumbling, Zakail visibly shrank back, holding his breath.\"Did Yuder say it was okay?\"\"No.\"\"Then don't.\"After saying this, Gakane approached Devran and whispered just loudly enough for him to hear.\"When Yuder finishes his work and comes back, that guy's done for. You don't need to soil your hands. Our leader will take care of it. So, bear with it for a little longer. For the sake of your family.\"\"...All right.\"At the mention of his family, Devran, whose face had softened, subdued his fiery temper and exhaled. They took Zakail, who they had apprehended, and returned to Hartan Castle.The villagers, seeing Zakail caught by the shadow clone and lifted up, wore expressions as though they were about to faint, but were even more surprised when they saw Devran and his family who had returned alive.\"What on earth happened? I thought he was dead?\"\"Considering Lord Zakail has been captured, it seems\u2026\"\"Goodness, what in the world is happening!\"And their confusion peaked when they entered the castle and came face-to-face with a terrified-looking elderly attendant.\"Lo, Lord Zakail! Not long ago, Lord Za, Za, Zachlis had returned and was waiting\u2026but\u2026what on earth\u2026.\"\"Zachlis is here?\"On behalf of Zakail, who was gagged by the shadow clone, Devran shouted out loud.\"That's good. Where is he now?\"\"In, in, in the parlor\u2026\"\"Let's go.\"They all rushed to the parlor. The same parlor where, this morning, Yuder and his colleagues had devoured a plethora of food, much to Zakail's annoyance, now had a man dressed in silver armor anxiously pacing.The man, who had a similar appearance to Zakail but seemed much kinder, was startled by the sudden influx of people. However, upon noticing Devran and Dermilla behind him, his eyes widened in shock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dermilla!\"\"Zachlis!\"As though no one else existed, the man who arrived breathlessly embraced Devran's sister, weeping loudly. Even Devran, who was about to shout at him, couldn't stop their momentum.\"Dermilla! Dermilla! Is it really you?\"\"Yes, it's me.\"\"I can't believe it, by the gods. After hearing that you were dead, I, I couldn't... Oh, thank the gods!\"After a long bout of sobbing in each other's arms, Zachlis Hartan finally calmed down enough to engage in conversation.\"I, I'm sorry everyone. The shock of this... miracle... So, what exactly has happened? Who are you all?\"\"Do you not remember me, Sir Zachlis?\"At Devran's sarcastic query, Zachlis quickly shook his head.\"No, not you. I remember you, Devran. What in the world happened? Why is Zakail in this state?\"Devran, who was still holding his sister's hand and whose eyes were red from crying, gave Zachlis an indescribable look. Gakane thought it would be better if he took over.\"It is a pleasure to meet you, Sir Zachlis Hartan.\"\"Yes, I am Zachlis Hartan.\"\"I am Gakane Bolunwald, a Cavalry under Duke Peletta, assigned to investigate Devran Hartude's disappearance. If I may ask, I heard you were to return a few days later due to some business with your order. It appears you've returned earlier than expected?\"\"Well, that's...actually, I received a letter during a funeral yesterday about an urgent matter, but I ran into a colleague in a village this morning who told me there was no such issue. He suggested that there might have been a mistake in delivering the command. So, I immediately returned to the village.\"At those words, both Gakane and Devran's gazes simultaneously turned towards Zakail. Zakail had been avoiding their gazes and showing a hardened face since seeing his brother.\"Oh, what to do. You wanted to chase Sir Zachlis away for a long time and kill us all in the meantime, but it didn't go as planned, did it?\"\"...\"\"What do you mean?\"Zachlis frowned, glancing back and forth between Devran and his brother.\"What did Zakail do? Is it related to the news that Devran killed his family and committed suicide?\"Zachlis was not as clueless as expected for a knight. Gakane glanced at Devran and slowly began to speak.\"Please listen carefully to what I am about to tell you.\"Although there didn't seem to be much affection among the family members, it would still be a shock to Zachlis, being Zakail's brother.Ignoring Zakail who was struggling against the shadow spirit restraining him, Gakane calmly began to explain.\"We believe that Zakail is involved in all of these incidents. The reasons are...\"As Gakane narrated, Devran, his younger sister, and the Awakeners each contributed, filling in the gaps in the story.At first, Zachlis wore an expression of disbelief, utterly shocked. But as the story came to an end, he looked at everyone with a cool and collected gaze.\"...and so we have joined forces and returned here. That is all.\"\"I see. Understood.\"A long sigh slipped through Zachlis' lips. He slowly took in the sight of his lover's tear-stained face, the wounded Devran, and Gakane and Jimmy in their black uniforms. His gaze finally settled on Zakail, who looked worn out, as if he had given up on everything, and stared back with a dreadful glare.\"Could we release Zakail for a moment? It seems we need to hear his side of the story.\"\"More of this...!\"Gakane raised his hand to quiet the increasingly agitated Devran and nodded in understanding.\"Alright. But, understand this\u2014we won't entirely free him because he might try to escape. We will only release his mouth.\"\"That's fine.\"To Gakane's eyes, Zachlis already seemed to believe their story was true. As the shadow clone that was covering Zakail's mouth slowly lowered its hand, Zachlis moved closer to him.\"Brother, you don't actually believe their words, do you?\"\"Zakail.\"Zakail looked at his elder brother who had just called his name and forced a pale smile onto his face. But the smile was oddly twisted, as if he was struggling to control his facial muscles, making him look even more strange.\"It's all lies. You know I can't do anything. How could I betray Father and Sister? They're targeting me and making up stories!\"\"....\"\"If I were to join hands, who would I do it with? This is absurd. As you know, I'm not interested in the lord's position. I'll give it all to you. Then it'll be fine, right? You trust me, don't you?\"\"Zakail.\"Zachlis called his brother's name again. For the first time, Zakail realized his elder brother, whose eyes he always thought were filled with pointless dreams and annoyance, could look so cold.\"Enough with the lies.\"A chill ran down Zakail's spine.\"Don't tell me you thought your strange behavior over the past year had gone unnoticed by our family.\"\"...What?\"\"You've always had the most greed among us brothers, but never put in the effort. Even when Father worked hard to pave a path for you to become a scholar, you threw away the opportunity and started mingling with suspicious figures a year ago. How should we have interpreted that?\"Zakail was so surprised he unintentionally opened his mouth.\"...Wha, what are you talking about?\"\"I'm talking about the fact that Father hastened the inheritance of the lordship to our sister because of you. If we had left you to your devices, you would certainly have dragged other powers into our territory, putting us all in danger.\"Zachlis sighed and looked down at his younger brother.\"But it seems it was too late. I had no idea you would involve my lover to satisfy your greed. Quite impressive, really. You precisely knew what kind of action would make me lose my senses and you acted on it.\"\"No, brother. That's not it. Listen to me! Are you really going to cast out your own brother based on these baseless stories and being blinded by a commoner lover?\"\"Zakail. Her name is Dermilla. No\u2026 Now, having taken on Devran's last name, she is Dermilla Hartude.\"\"What does that matter now!\"\"It's far more important than my brother who tried to kill my lover and sent me a fake letter to drive me away.\"Zachlis pulled out a letter from his chest.\"If this letter wasn't truly sent from the Knights, we need to find the culprit, don't we? It seems quite interesting if we bring those guys who claimed to have captured and tortured Devran.\"\"...I didn't send it.\"\"Do you think they will say the same? If you had no interest in the lordship, you must first explain why as soon as I returned to this castle, many servants spoke exactly the opposite of you. They were convinced that you, Zakail, would inherit the lordship.\"Only then did Zakail's face contort violently.\"\u2026That's... just the stupid commoners babbling!\"\"Oh? Then I suppose it's fine if I take the lordship.\"\"What? But, you are in the Knights\u2026\"\"If I can be by Dermilla's side, I don't care where I am. It might be better to inherit the lordship, marry her, and send you away.\"\"Ha...haha. That's a lie, right...?\"Zakail managed a weak smile as he studied his brother's face. But there was no sign of jest in Zachlis's cold gaze.'No, it's not true. He's lying to shake me up. My brother, how could he leave the Knights and accept a small town's lordship. That can't be. It's not true.'But if Zachlis truly said he would become the lord of Hartan, there was no power anywhere that could overturn that. Zakail knew this too well, and despite his self-comforting words, he couldn't dispel his anxiety.The long-standing tradition from the east was stronger than law. Even the people of Apeto couldn't overturn it. Who could dare oppose an eldest son, even one year older, inheriting his father's estate?Zakail saw his wide dreams, which he thought were spread out before him, collapse in an instant. All his plans started from becoming the lord of Hartan. What if he couldn't secure the lordship of Hartan?Would anyone give a new opportunity to him, who would simply be the incompetent youngest son of a noble family?\"No, it's not true. It's not true!\"Zakail shook his head and writhed.\"It's not what you really meant, right? Right? Brother, you said you're fine as long as you have her. She came back alive, so why are you doing this to me! Don't I deserve any pity...! Uh...!\"Gakane had stopped Zakail's mouth around that point, so his yell was quickly stifled into a groan. Zachlis, who was watching his brother reveal his greedy gaze and struggle in desperation, sighed and turned his back.\"Thank you.\"\"Do you wish to not speak further?\"\"Well, as you can see, there's nothing more to hear. The circumstances of everything are so clear.\"There was no trace of sympathy for his brother in Zachlis's eyes. He brushed back his hair with a slightly tired face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Apeto Duchy has been trying to expand its power in the east these days.\"Upon hearing this, Gakane glanced slightly towards Devran. He could see Devran nodding, signifying his agreement with Zachlis's assessment.\"I also heard that name when I was captured.\"\"I see. Apeto...\"\u2018Could those that Yuder is currently facing also be of this family?\u2019 Gakane didn't know much about the Apeto Duchy, but he decided to include the name in the letter he would send to Kishiar.\"I am truly sorry for failing to resolve the troubles within our household in a timely manner, causing many people to commit irreversible sins. Especially you, Devran, I have nothing to say.\"When Zachlis made an apologetic knightly salute, not just Devran, but all the commoner Awakeners were taken aback. They hadn't expected him to go so far.\"Well... Zachlis, you didn't sell me out.\"\"Still, your father and Dermilla could have died. Had I been here, such a thing wouldn't have happened....\"Seeing him apologize so formally left Devran no room to act coldly towards him. Devran sighed heavily, glanced at his younger sister standing behind him, and lowered his head.\"Hasn't Lord Zachlis also lost family members? It's alright. My family and I are all still alive.\"From what Gakane could see, Zachlis seemed more upset about the injuries inflicted upon his lover and her family than the death of his own.It wasn't surprising that familial love wasn't deep in most noble families, but it was clear that his feelings towards Dermilla were sincere.\"Lord Zachlis, may we borrow a messenger bird for a moment? I believe we need to write a report to our Commander immediately.\"\"Of course. I need to contact the knight's order as well. I suspect I'll be here for a while.\"Zachlis declared that he would keep Zakail locked in his room until this matter was settled. At his command, servants entered the reception room with anxious expressions and escorted Zakail, who had been freed from the shadow clone, out of the room.Zakail was led away, looking half dazed, as if he believed that his brother might actually accept the position of Lord of Hartan.\"Devran, let's go up and write a letter to the Commander. Jimmy, take good care of everyone here, make sure nothing happens.\"\"Will do.\"Jimmy's face was full of resolve as he gripped the hilt of the sword on his waist. If it had been earlier, his stance would have been seen as cute, a spectacle for laughter, but no one laughed after seeing the sword aura Jimmy exuded.Following Zachlis's guidance, Gakane borrowed a messenger bird that only those working at the Hartan lord's castle could use. He tried to write the letter as briefly as possible, combining what Devran said and what he had found out, but there was so much to cover that it took longer than expected.\"It's a bit of a waste. It would've been nice if Kanna was here.\"\"Huh? Kanna? Ah, the deputy commander of Jung Division?\"When Gakane murmured, stopping his letter-writing for a moment as a thought occurred to him, Devran looked at him with a puzzled expression.\"Ah, the ability to read the information contained in objects would have been a big help if I had it here. If Kanna had seen Lord Zachlis's letter, we would have immediately known who wrote it, and we would have known sooner where you were taken. It was a bit tricky to get information since the people of this village wouldn't speak.\"At first, he thought it was just a small incident, but he didn't expect it to grow so unexpectedly. Who would have thought that the disappearance of Devran before coming here would involve a surprising group like the Apeto Duchy?'This might become bigger than I thought.'But, having accomplished the original objective of finding Devran and keeping him safe, their task here was done. If things escalated further, Gakane knew it was to be left to the Commander, Kishiar.'I wonder if Yuder will be okay on his own against the people of the Apeto Duchy... especially when he's alone with the bandit leader. Even knowing he's strong, I'm suddenly worried.'Gakane watched the flying messenger bird carrying the letter until it completely disappeared from sight, and then turned.\"Let's go, Devran.\"\"Are we leaving immediately as planned?\"\"We have to.\"\"Hmm...\"Gakane tilted his head at the lukewarm low hum from Devran.\"What's the matter? Is there something bothering you?\"\"Well... the reason we wanted to escape here was because we thought Zakail would be alone. But now that Lord Zachlis is here and the situation has changed... there's no need to immediately leave with the injured, is there?\"Devran suggested that it might be more comfortable for them to join Yuder here. Gakane couldn't help but consider this for a moment.\"I'm fine with these injuries, but there are others who need proper care...\"'He's got a point.'If they left, Zachlis would have to monitor Zakail alone, and if anything happened to Yuder, they wouldn't be able to rush to his aid immediately. Gakane pondered for a moment before responding.\"Alright, we'll stay here just for tonight, have a proper meal, and...\"\"Gakane, Devran!\"Just then, the door burst open with the sound of hurried footsteps from outside. An excited Jimmy rushed in and gestured at Gakane and Devran.\"Come out quickly. There's another huge fire in the mountains!\"\"What?\"\"It's a fire that broke out much further than before. I think Yuder might be...\"Before Jimmy could finish, Gakane rushed outside. The place they visited to send the messenger bird was located right under the highest roof of Hartan Castle, so as soon as they went out, the outside scenery was clearly visible.And just as Jimmy said, in the distant mountains, an enormous pillar of fire was shooting up, as if it was trying to pierce the sky.\"With that size... everyone in this area must have seen it.\"Devran, who had followed Gakane, murmured in astonishment at the sight of the fire.\"Devran, could you make a fire that big?\"\"No. The biggest fire I can make is about the size of the one from earlier. That... to be honest, it's beyond imagination. Even if we gathered all the Awakeners with fire control ability from the Cavalry...\"It was Yuder. Yuder must have caused it. Gakane's intuition flared sharply.\"Yuder. What on earth is happening there...?\"------When Yuder Aile stepped into the spacious chamber at the very back of the cave, the scene inside wasn't much different from what he had expected. The familiar Warden and a few of his cronies were seated in a circle, chatting idly.\"We should probably drain some energy out of that noble brat before questioning him at dawn. You handle it, No.3. And has there been any communication from headquarters yet?\"\"Unless there are unforeseen issues, we should hear something by today...\"\"Huh? Who's there?\"The man who had noticed Yuder and Nahan's entrance opened his mouth in surprise. Yuder raised his hand and gave a light swing before they could fully comprehend the situation.\"Argh!\"The cave was instantly thrown into disarray by a sudden whirlwind. All the people and items inside were swept into the air, frantically fluttering about. In the midst of this chaos, screams echoed throughout the cavern.\"Save me!\"\"What's happening!\"Yuder watched those who were made a mess of, colliding with flying furniture within the whirlwind, for a while. Suddenly, he felt a tingling pain rising from one hand and lowered his head.'What's this?'But the situation was not relaxed enough to inspect it right away, so he quickly diverted his attention. When he thought he had sufficiently stirred things up, he quieted the wind. Amidst the shattered furniture and the jumbled mess of people, they dropped to the ground, groaning.\"Ahh... Ahh...!\"\"My, my arm...!\"\"Nahan. Gather them all together. I'll tie them up.\"\"Quick and simple. I suppose there might not be another in the world who could subdue this many people so easily, save for you brother.\"Despite being told numerous times not to refer to him as brother, Nahan never seemed to get the hint and endlessly repeated the same thing. But there were more pressing matters than correcting him at the moment, so Yuder just scowled slightly and focused on the task at hand.Once he had tied up all the fallen men and gathered them in one place, he counted seven in total. Among them, the Awakeners who had fought against Kiolle under the Warden's order were knocked unconscious by a blow to the back of the neck, and separately quarantined.The Warden and his subordinates, who had watched the entire process unfold flawlessly, were petrified with fear, unable to fathom the identities of Yuder and Nahan.\"You... who the hell are you? Who sent you...!\"\"That's not important.\"Yuder walked towards the Warden, whose face was swollen from getting hit by the broken furniture.\"I'm short on time, so let's make this brief. Do you work for the Apeto Ducal Family?\"\"...Kill us!\"Ignoring Yuder's question, the Warden shouted with his toothless mouth.\"Whoever you are, we will never talk. Just kill us!\"'So quick to ask for death.'The sight of these men, who had not only captured innocent Awakeners to use as tools of power struggle but also attached low-quality bombs to their backs, puffing up their chests and squawking bravely after a minor beating, was absurdly amusing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those who took on dangerous missions, ready to face death if captured, typically carried poison within them or signed an oath that would explode and kill them instantly if they were caught.'Those who neither carry poison nor sign oaths sure talk big,' Yuder thought.Yuder had his own way of dealing with such individuals. For those without the courage to kill themselves, the best approach was to induce fear by stimulating their imagination.As he moved to draw his sword without a word, Nahan, who had been observing Yuder's actions so far, grabbed his shoulder.\"Wait. Would you let me handle this?\"\"And what will you do?\"\"You're trying to make them docile, aren't you? That's my specialty. Besides, I have my own score to settle with them.\"Nahan's gaze briefly landed on the boy who was hiding behind his back and then on those who were bound. Hearing Nahan's emphasis on the word 'imagination,' Yuder remembered what Nahan's power was.'Using illusion powers for interrogation?'Suddenly, Yuder became interested. He nodded and stepped back.\"Fine.\"\"I promise I'll be faster.\"As Nahan stepped forward in place of Yuder, the Warden's scarred face contorted with fear and disgust.\"You\u2026 What the hell are you?\"\"I am an ally and an avenger for my brother.\"\"Brother? Are you talking about that mute kid?\"The Warden's eyes darted nervously towards the boy hiding behind Nahan.'Mute?'Yuder had thought the boy was simply scared because he hadn't said a word so far, but could he actually be unable to speak? As Yuder turned his head, the boy flinched and averted his gaze.'Hmm, I didn't mean to scare him....'Just as Yuder was about to say something to the boy, a sudden outburst came from behind him.\"Ah, I see. I understand now. You lot came to rescue those locked-up bastards! Yes, I've heard there are madmen like you these days...ugh!\u201dBefore he could finish his words, he suddenly screamed and fell to the side, as if he had been hit by something. The faces of those bound with him simultaneously contorted.\"Warden...?\"\"Wait, wait! Don't come! What is this, what's happening! No! Ah, no, no!\"The Warden twisted and turned, screaming at the empty air, looking every which way. It seemed like he could not hear nor see anyone speaking to him.'What's going on? There's nothing there.'As Yuder stared at the void, he turned his gaze to Nahan who was observing the Warden in extreme terror, shrieking. Nahan was looking down at the Warden like an insignificant bug, a faint smile playing on his lips. From the small ripple of energy emanating from Nahan's fingertips, it was clear that he was using his power.The screams didn't stop for a while. Gradually, any semblance of human emotion faded from the Warden's face.In the end, he wet himself on the spot without even being able to utter a proper plea or moan. He was shaking, muttering into the empty air as though he were mad, the stench of urine around him. His appearance was indeed that of a madman.\"Please, please, please stop. Stop. I...I've made a mistake. Uh...ugh...aaaah!\"Everyone present, observing the grotesque scene of his twitching arms and legs and contorted face, was gripped by absolute terror. Even those who had previously faced Yuder and Nahan with some semblance of composure while being held captive could no longer meet their gaze, panting heavily with fear.The most potent fear often comes not from personal experience, but rather from witnessing it up close and imagining that you might be next. From Yuder's perspective, Nahan seemed to understand this quite well and wielded it masterfully.'I wonder what they were doing before this. I guess the curiosity naturally falls to the other side.'Yuder studied Nahan's cruelly smiling eyes. What kind of illusion was this man presenting to the Warden? Although he didn't really want to know, the fact that he started to use his ability just when the Warden was about to say something irked Yuder.'But there's something else bothering me more right now...'Yuder covertly glanced at his own hand. Between the slightly exposed sleeves of his crossed arms, he could see his wrist turning a violet shade. Dark spots had started to creep up his hand, covering his skin above the black glove.'I didn\u2019t think too much about using my power, but I didn't expect it to become like this.'Until now, the appearance of spots had never been accompanied by pain, but now a needle-like tingling sensation intermittently throbbed from slightly above his elbow to his hand. Opening and closing his fist did not alleviate the pain.'It's unfortunate I can\u2019t remove my clothes now to check how far it has spread... but if the pain corresponds to the area of the spots, it\u2019s probably just above my elbow now.'Elbow. Yuder remembered that Kishiar had said that was the approximate limit for effective treatment. Despite the red gem Kishiar had given him to prevent the spots from spreading quickly and which he had properly kept in his pocket, this had happened.'When the spots spread near the elbow, I started to feel mild pain. I wonder what happens if it spreads more.'While curious, he wasn't too keen to find out. Yuder took a deep breath after clenching and unclenching his fist again.'I should minimize my power usage from now on.'While Yuder was examining his arm, Nahan was ruthlessly casting his illusion on others. The sight of people scattered around, bashing their own heads on the ground or breaking their own fingers while crying and groaning, was nothing short of hellish.\"That\u2019s enough now. I only need to hear answers to the questions, so let one of them regain consciousness.\"\"It's not enough yet.\"Nahan murmured, standing in front of a man who was tearing at his own hair while crying.\"You volunteered to help. If you want to play, get out. I\u2019m busy.\"\"Cold-hearted, aren\u2019t you? Alright.\"Nahan gestured slightly towards a man who was collapsed at his feet, pleading for mercy and banging his head on the ground. Yuder belatedly realized this man was the Warden.Although only a brief moment had passed, he looked as if he had aged decades. His skin, soaked with sweat and fatigue, had wrinkled, his eyes were bulging as if he was going mad, and his hair had half turned white, which all made him look even older.\"Now, answer this man's question.\"\"Mercy...mercy...\"'This is serious.'Yuder had endured countless tortures in his past life and had himself taken many lives. However, this was the first time he had witnessed something that could so swiftly and decisively drive a person to madness.Until now, he had thought of illusionary powers as less threatening, but for the first time, he began to sense a caution that they might be otherwise.The Warden's state was indeed pitiful to an extreme.\"Apeto family's Warden. Can you hear me?\"As Yuder asked in a even more rigid and cold voice, the trembling Warden's eyes regained some focus.\"Ah... Apeto.\"\"Yes, you're the warden of the Apeto family, correct? Answer me.\"\"Ye, ye, yes.\"The Warden quickly nodded his head.\"Your name. What is your name?\"\"Ah, ah, Alban. Alban.\"\"Good, Alban. What were you doing here?\"The Warden, who had been previously defiant, threatening to kill or never speak, had all but lost his bravado. He seemed so grateful for Yuder's questioning that, like a child, he sobbed and spilled everything.'As I thought, it wasn't much different from the conjectures I had made after listening to Devran.'They were originally dispatched from the east to expand the power of the Apeto family. But, starting from two years ago, they also started kidnapping Awakeners, who were being ostracized in the surrounding areas, along with the mercenary Awakeners sent from the main house.After torturing the captured ones to a certain extent to kill their spirits, they made them write an oath to work for the Apeto family and sent them to the main house, their job was done then.\"The main house. What happens to the Awakeners sent there?\"\"Th, they... I'm not sure... but I've... heard... they are researched.\"\"Researched?\"\"Th, the priests. They stay and conduct research. There are many people in the main house who are connected to the temple... The Apeto family has traditionally sent many children to the Sun God temple... So, the temple... we contact once a week... and visit... once a month... even now...\"While letting the warden's words, including the parts he hadn't asked about, flow in one ear, Yuder focused on the words 'priests' and 'research'.\"Did you hear what kind of research they are trying to conduct?\"\"Th, th, th, that...\"The Warden scrunched up his face in pain and gasped for breath.\"I, I can't... but...\"\"Speak.\"Nahan, who was standing next to him, commanded coldly. Upon that, the Warden, who had stiffened for a moment, opened his trembling mouth with tears streaming down his face. His eyes rolled around like a madman's.\"Aaah. They're trying to... make them give birth... to a child... Research...!\"\"A child?\"\"A special, special child... Aaah!\"At that moment, the Warden let out a scream of pain. It wasn't because of the illusion that Nahan showed him. He gushed blood from his eyes, nose, and ears, and died in an instant.Silence swept over the body that had suddenly collapsed.'I thought he hadn't written a vow of secrecy, but it seems he had.' Yuder looked down at the body with cold eyes.'Research to make them give birth to a special child. What on earth does that mean?'\"...Wake the next person. We need to ask again.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, the others could not answer the same question at all.The only thing Yuder could find out was the fact that the family had given more rewards than usual when they caught an Awakener with a certain condition, and there was a box containing a small amount of correspondence they had exchanged with the family.\"They gave rewards when you caught a certain Awakener? Say it again.\"Yuder asked the same question again to the last person Nahan had woken. The man, who had gone mad after seeing the illusion shown by Nahan, replied, laughing with his mouth wide open.\"Whether it's Alpha or Omega, that. Hehe, hehehe. Especially when we handed over those who were in heat... So they told us to leave them alone until they were in heat and then send them, the Warden did. Hehehe. Kehehehe.\"His babbling seemed insane, but the information that could be understood from his answer was clear.The priests who were said to be conducting research while staying in the Apeto family were looking for awakened individuals who had manifested their second gender.'Child. And the second gender....'For some reason, he had a bad feeling about it. Yuder grabbed the collar of the man who was laughing madly and then shedding tears.\"Hey. There should be some remaining contracts here too, right? Find them.\"After finding the remaining stack of contracts, Yuder rose from his seat holding them.\"Make sure these bastards don't mess around until I return.\"\"Are you going to that guy in the prison?\"Nahan asked in a soft voice.\"All I have to do is make him write the contract.\"\"It doesn't seem like a great idea, contracts are not absolute. That guy will someday repay today's mercy with enmity. Wouldn't it be easier just to kill him?\"\"That's not your concern.\"At Yuder's words, Nahan chuckled lowly. His smile still bore the cold and brutal traces, giving Yuder chills.\"Yes. It's none of my business.\"As Yuder turned his body, Nahan's low voice echoed as if grabbing him from behind.\"But it was just advice from a brother.\"------\"Eh, uh, ooh!\"Kiolle squirmed in fright when he saw Yuder's face spattered with fresh blood. Yuder couldn't be bothered to explain that it wasn't his blood, but the blood spurted from the dead Warden, so he thrust the contract he was holding in front of Kiolle's eyes.\"Quiet down and put your finger or something on here.\"\"Uh...?\"Kiolle stopped struggling and looked at the contract. There were a few sentences written in thin flame by Yuder while he was coming.[One. Kiolle Da Diarca shall not tell anyone about the event that happened today.Two. Kiolle Da Diarca cannot give unilateral commands, challenge to duels, or insult Yuder Aile or any other person.Three. Kiolle Da Diarca shall help Yuder Aile within his capabilities.Both parties will leave a contract mark on these matters.If Kiolle Da Diarca violates any of the above, the contract mark will signal and notify, and the violator will fall into eternal sleep immediately.]\"What... what is this?\"As soon as Yuder untied the ropes and the gag, Kiolle screamed.\"Eternal sleep? What does that mean? Does it mean you'll kill me or not?\"\"If you don't want to sign, then I\u2019ll leave immediately\u2026\"\"Damn it! I\u2019ll do it!\"Kiolle, his hand marked by rope burns, held up his hand, closed his eyes tight, and pressed his finger down. The moment he did so, a black smoke burst from the contract and in an instant, it had crept into the wrists of the two, leaving a mark behind.\"For your information, even if you leave here and try to kill me, it'll be useless. Because of the third clause, if you try to indirectly kill me, it would breach the contract.\"\"\u2026\"Perhaps he had thought of it before, for Kiolle's eyes slightly trembled.\"So, what happens if you just happen to die in an accident?\"\"If I die due to reasons unrelated to you, the contract will lose its power. The mark of the contract on your wrist will disappear.\"\"That won't affect me, will it?\"\"Right. So, get up now. Surely you aren't pretending you need someone to help you stand.\"At those words, Kiolle gritted his teeth and, with some difficulty, managed to push off the ground and stand up.\"So where are we headed now? Have you seen my sword? Where did you leave your companions? Don't tell me you killed all the dogs of the Apeto family? Or\u2026\"Who on earth would believe that this noisy fool was a senior knight of the Imperial Knights? As Yuder, who had been leading, turned his head to say something, he suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.Reactively gripping his sword and turning around, Yuder found himself halted at the sight of Nahan, a boy standing behind him, and the mercenary Awakeners with vacant expressions.\"Ah. You've already finished? That was quick.\"\"Where are the ones I told you to guard?\"\"That's the thing. There was an unfortunate accident.\"Nahan, his face spattered with blood like Yuder's, grinned quietly.\"I was just trying to keep them quiet for a bit, but they didn't seem to like that and ended up dying.\"\"What?\"\"Really sorry about that.\"From Nahan's calm expression, there was no sign of remorse typically associated with someone who had just caused an 'unfortunate accident'. Nahan, who had come close to Yuder, held out a box that had been hanging on his waist.\"Here. I brought this, so take it.\"It was a box containing the letters through which the people of Apeto house there had communicated with their main house. Amid a stifling tension, Yuder slowly reached out and took it. At that moment, Kiolle, who had locked eyes with Nahan, froze like a herbivore in front of a predator.\"Let's free the brothers trapped in the prison now.\"Nahan, with his smooth demeanor, approached the prison and re-emerged, leading the three mercenary Awakeners whom Yuder had imprisoned. He was unsure what ability Nahan had used, but they all had vacant expressions and were unusually docile.'I can't see a trace of rationality in them. If he has such abilities, why didn't he use them before\u2026'Why did Nahan choose to act now, after waiting so long? Were the members of the Apeto family, whom he claimed died in an unfortunate accident, really just victims of an accident?'Of course not.'Yuder's caution heightened a notch further than before. Sensing his guarded eyes, Nahan turned around and gave a faint smile.Facing his strange smile - one side horribly scarred, the other beautifully sculpted - Kiolle unwittingly took a step back, halting suddenly. Nahan, seemingly amused by his reaction, turned his head and opened his mouth towards Yuder.\"Aren't you leaving?\"\"You go ahead.\"There was no good to be found in exposing his back in such a situation. At Yuder's words, Nahan shrugged his shoulders and turned.\"As you wish, brother.\"The way out was eerily quiet. Yuder didn't know what had become of Devran and the Awakened escapees they had encountered along the way, but at least no one was springing out of nowhere.Even Kiolle, perhaps paralyzed by fear, had begun to quietly follow behind. The only sounds echoing through the darkness that half-shrouded them were the rhythmic footsteps as they trod the cave floor.'...Footsteps.'Suddenly, Yuder halted and looked to his side. Kiolle's flashy, high-quality boots brushed past him.Catching sight of Kiolle's face, eerily illuminated by the light streaming from the magic stones embedded in the wall, Yuder immediately grabbed Kiolle's arm and started running forward.'...Damn. Just as I thought.'Despite Yuder's sudden grab and run, Kiolle showed no reaction. His expression was vacant, just like the mercenary Awakeners who had emerged from the prison and stood behind Nahan. There was no doubt that he had fallen prey to Nahan's illusion ability.'He wasn't one to keep his mouth shut just because he was a bit scared.'When had it started? Was it from the moment Kiolle tried to step back when they crossed paths at the prison? Recalling as he ran, Yuder gradually slowed and stopped.\"You had me wondering where you were going, brother.\"Despite running a good distance backward, they found themselves once again before the vacant-faced mercenary Awakeners, the young boy, and Nahan. Nahan looked at Yuder with a composed expression and opened his mouth.\"I'm not sure why you're so guarded, but I don't think there's a need for that now that everything's over.\"\"Wouldn't you be guarded in this situation?\"Yuder asked coldly, looking around.\"Have you killed all of Apeto's people? Who are you going to kill next? Who the hell are you?\"\"You already know who I am.\"\"I find it hard to believe at this point.\"What certainty can there be against an illusionist who could suddenly twist the path ahead? To what extent was the Nahan that Yuder saw the real one?Was he truly just a somewhat cruel bandit leader who gathered wandering Awakeners? Reading the whirl of suspicion in Yuder's eyes, Nahan chuckled.\"You're quite suspicious.\"\u201cWell, that's not so bad, either,\u201d Nahan muttered and turned his gaze to Kiolle's arm, held by Yuder.\"I mean no harm to your brother. Just let go of his arm. That's all.\"'...Was Kiolle the target?'In response, Yuder gripped Kiolle's arm even tighter.\"Kiolle Da Diarca.\"\"...\"No response came to the whispered name. Kiolle, with a vacant look like a puppet, merely swayed weakly as Yuder shook him.\"Kiolle!\"Even a slap that echoed loudly against his cheek did nothing. With a sigh at Kiolle's uselessness, Yuder looked back at Nahan.\"Don't tell me he stays like this forever unless you release him.\"\"Of course not. My ability isn't that powerful.\"But Nahan's eyes said he had no intention of revealing the condition. If it had been usual, Yuder would have used his power to get rid of Nahan right there and then, but now his throbbing hand was a distraction and he couldn't immediately do so. Yuder held his silence for a moment, then opened his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Why do we have to kill this one too? Why?\"\"Why are you so keen on protecting him? He's a worthless human being.\"In Nahan's cold grey eyes, a ruthless gleam arose.\"There's no value in us fighting over that idiotic man. Haven't I been a decent ally up until now? Trust me. Let go of his arm and come here.\"\"...\"Yuder looked down at Kiolle's arm.'Well, his point is hard to deny.'Kiolle Diarca may indeed be a person not worth saving here. Perhaps he might regret this moment.'However.'Yuder took a deep breath and gripped Kiolle's arm even tighter.\"No.\"Nahan's fleeting smile vanished the moment Yuder's resounding response echoed throughout the dark cave.\"What kind of ally kills all the witnesses on a whim, without any reason? I find you, who kills people as casually as a brainless nobleman, more distasteful.\"Indeed. From the beginning, Nahan was a suspicious man. He was more elusive than Kiolle, who was transparent in every aspect\u2014origin and character alike. It was disconcerting to Yuder that Nahan, unlike Kiolle, gave no hint of what he hid behind his back, no matter how amiable he seemed.'Don't trust anything you can't clearly understand.' This was one of the advices left by Kishiar before he handed over his position in Yuder's previous life.Yuder always recalled that advice when on a mission. It was the most practical and helpful advice of all.\"Stubbornness toward worthless targets only leads to unfavorable outcomes.\"\"And who are you to decide that? By what standards?\"At Yuder's question, Nahan fell silent. His left eye, marred by a red scar, stared blankly into space. Lost in thought, he slowly opened his mouth.\"The standard is simple. The presence or absence of power.\"'Presence or absence of power?' Yuder repeated the unusual words in his mind, trying to memorize them.\"I will do anything for my brothers and sisters who share the same power and will. And I will take lives as payment from those who have insulted and trampled upon us. There are no negotiations.\"With an emotionless voice, Nahan finished his sentence and turned his gaze back to Yuder.\"You're a smart brother. You must understand what I'm trying to say. Now let go of his hand...\"\"...You're not just a simple bandit leader, are you?\"Yuder's sudden remark halted Nahan's speech.\"Where are you from? What's your purpose?\"Nahan had claimed that he and his bandits would leave the empire once they had gathered enough money. However, thinking back, the bandits were also Awakeners, who had left their original homes, and the dazed-faced mercenaries standing behind him were also Awakeners.Considering the boy he had come all the way here to save was also an Awakener, it seemed that Nahan's purpose in gathering the Awakeners was not for personal or pure reasons.'Was there an individual or group trying to gather Awakeners who had lost their way during this time? There wasn't in my previous life.'\"Are you targeting the Cavalry? Or is rebellion your goal?\"\"Neither,\" Nahan replied.Yuder, who had been intensely pondering and about to speak, was shortly interrupted by Nahan, who furrowed his brows.\"Really, such a suspicious brother. Why does it matter whether I belong somewhere or not? All I want is to clean up this mess and leave.\"At the same time as he moved his finger subtly, Kiolle, with a dumbfounded expression, started shaking his arm forcefully to shake off Yuder's hand. The force was strong enough that it could have slipped in an instant.\"Let go.\"\"I said I don't want to, ah.\"In the moment Yuder was about to respond, Kiolle had stopped struggling and tried to kick him. Yuder dodged it and, clicking his tongue, struck Kiolle's nape hard.It was a strength enough to knock out a common person or even a trained knight, but surprisingly, Kiolle did not fall. He just opened his mouth dumbly and tried to escape Yuder.\"I can't understand. Why are you going to such lengths?\"\"I told you. I don't like your side, more than this guy. So, and...\"Yuder, while trying to suppress the increasingly violently resisting Kiolle, raised his voice.\"Don't order me around because you're upset. There's only one person who can command me!\"The moment his words ended, Yuder buried Kiolle in the ground, leaving only his head exposed. Kiolle, buried deep below the collapsed ground, twitched as he let out a low moan, but he couldn't break free from the hardened soil.At the same time, Yuder's arm throbbed heavily.'I tried not to use my power... I had no choice.'Yuder, while glaring at Nahan, the culprit who forced him to use his power, drew his sword from his waist. As flames began to crawl up the blade in a spiral, Nahan was seen frowning.\"Planning to attack?\"\"You started it.\"Nahan frowned. His expression seemed strangely like he wanted to laugh, but also didn't.\"Well, fine. Then I'll do my best to get rid of this trash.\"\u201cUsing powers against brothers was strictly prohibited, but there was no choice with a skilled person like you.\u201d As soon as those words ended, Nahan's face started to ripple.As soon as he saw it, his head and body became rapidly heavy. Yuder instinctively realized he was trying to use an illusion power against him.'He's trying to incapacitate me and achieve his objective in the meantime...!'Yuder quickly used his power to protect Kiolle, who was buried in the ground. However, in that moment, the scenery before his eyes abruptly changed with a swift sound of wind.'Yudrain.'It was a very strange sensation. Yuder was certainly aware that he was kneeling inside a cave holding onto Kiolle, but at the same time he saw a beautiful golden-haired man speaking to him. It was Kishiar in his white uniform.Obviously, Kishiar was the illusion. He was someone who couldn't appear here now. Plus, he was calling him Yudrain, not Yuder. A name that no longer had a reason to be called.His cool reason made the obvious judgment, but even knowing that, Yuder stiffened for a moment.'This trick.''Yudrain.'Kishiar called Yuder again. The enchantingly captivating low voice echoed in his ears.He had to ignore it. He needed to avert his gaze from those crimson eyes. Even though he knew he needed to move somehow, his hand wouldn't obey, as though caught by something...\"Was it a good experience? The one where you plunged your knife into my heart.\"Kishiar lowered the hand he had been holding near his chest. A gaping hole, where blood gushed ceaselessly, was visible between the black gloves he wore. Yuder knew the nature of that wound very well.It was a wound that he himself had inflicted.Before he knew it, Yuder realized he was panting heavily.\"It's all an illusion.\"He knew it. He knew it, yet why couldn't he tear his gaze away from Kishiar? His heart was pounding so hard that he could feel it reverberating through his fingertips.The strength slowly ebbed from the hand that held Kiolle. Behind Kishiar's illusion, Yuder saw Nahan, looking down at him with gray eyes shining.Nahan was quietly smiling as he watched Yuder's distorted expression. Seeing that, a semblance of reason flickered in Yuder's warped mind.\"Perhaps, this is an illusion to stimulate the subject's fear and to drain their spirit. That guy, he doesn't know Kishiar. So this is purely... an element drawn from my own memory...\"\"Yudrain.\"The chain of thoughts that had barely been forming shattered instantly at Kishiar's call. The illusion of Kishiar approached and knelt on one knee in front of Yuder. Yuder was overwhelmed by a powerful urge to release his grip on Kiolle and retreat.\"Answer me.\"An incorporeal bloodied hand came closer and touched his cheek. Despite being an illusion, the sensation was so vivid that it sent shivers down his spine. Yuder gritted his teeth at the sensation of the blood from Kishiar's body soaking his cheek.\"Answer me, Yudrain.\"He almost responded reflexively. But he mustn't answer. He could sense it instinctively. If he responded to those words, then, he would be succumbing to the intense pressure weighing on his head and shoulders.\"To break free from a mental. From a mental ability attack. The general way is...\"He desperately tried to hold on to his numbing sense of reason and remember. This was his first encounter with such a potent illusion ability, but he had met enough psychic ability users. Usually, to counter such abilities that target the mind...\"Attack the caster, or else.\"The sound of his gasping breath pounded in his ears like a drum. Yuder glared into Kishiar's red eyes and raised the sword he had been holding in one hand. Following this, a small sound, as if something made of flesh and blood had been brutally sliced, echoed within the cave.\"...\"A moment later, Yuder, gasping for breath, opened his eyes. Intense pain radiated from the arm that he had deliberately cut deeply. But his mind was clear, and Kishiar was no longer in sight.Instead, the sight that came into his sharpened view was of Nahan, who had approached unnoticed and was swinging a blood-soaked dagger at Kiolle.\"This bastard.\"Without wasting a moment, Yuder swung his own sword to block Nahan. With a sharp clang, the two swords collided forcefully. While parrying Nahan's sword, Yuder used the wind to fling him ruthlessly against the cave wall and picked up Kiolle from the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Ugh... What... what is this....\"At the same time Nahan's body violently collided with the wall, Kiolle managed to somewhat pull herself out of the illusion and regain consciousness. Groaning softly, she shook his head.\"Why does my arm hurt so... No, why... why am I covered in dirt...? What is this!\"\"That's not the problem. If you've regained your senses, run quickly!\"The boy, Nahan's companion, started running toward him. Yuder grabbed Kiolle, who had thankfully recovered enough to maintain a good speed, and they both sprinted.Without looking back, they fled from the cave. Outside, the day was faintly fading as the sun began to dip behind the mountains.\"We... we finally made it out... But what the hell just happened? What was that...\"\"Be quiet.\"Fighting a dizzying wave of vertigo, Yuder moved forward. This was where they had tied up and hidden two mercenary Awakeners before entering the cave.For better or worse, the only things left were the loosened gags and ropes. No one remained.'Hopefully, they were discovered by Devran's group, took a beating, and ran....'\"What... what's this rope for?\"Kiolle exclaimed at the sight of the gags and pieces of rope. Yuder didn't respond, just kept walking. His arm throbbed incessantly. The pain from the knife wound paled in comparison to the throbbing sensation welling up from his puncture wound.Yet he could endure that much pain. Currently, Yuder's mind was filled with questions about Nahan's unexpectedly powerful abilities and his true identity.'Perhaps Nahan is more important than even Apeto Family. Why didn't such a conspicuous person appear in my past life? Did he continually hide himself with his illusionary abilities? Or perhaps....'\"That one hurt a bit.\"At that moment, an unbelievable voice came from ahead. Yuder turned his head, following Kiolle's wide-eyed gaze.Incredibly, Nahan and the small boy who were undoubtedly left behind in the cave, as well as the still dazed mercenary Awakeners, all stood there.'Did I mistakenly think that what I left behind was an illusion?'For a moment, that doubt sprouted in his mind, but Yuder soon realized it was not the case. Blood was seeping from a cut on Nahan's forehead, proving that the collision was real. But how could they have gotten here faster than Yuder and Kiolle?\"It seems my power even surprises a great warrior like you.\"Nahan smirked at Yuder's expression.\"It's simple. I can use my power more deeply than usual on a few targets I choose for a certain amount of time. The duration is short, but the effect is certain.\"\"...\"\"The more you doubt and get confused, the deeper you fall into the illusion. A beautiful illusion that surpasses even the senses in reality. Just like now, when you think we've teleported, but we actually just walked past you.\"A cold smile crossed Nahan's face. After a moment of silence, Yuder asked,\"Why are you bothering to explain all this?\"\"Because it helps to amplify the doubt. I have no choice but to do my best to incapacitate someone who managed to break even a powerful illusion that most people couldn't endure. It's quite beneficial.\"If what he had said was true, Yuder, who had been made a fool of his sense of time and space, was clearly heavily eroded by the power of that profound illusion.What would happen when he was completely consumed by that ability? The face of Kishiar he had seen in the illusion moments ago flashed across his mind.\"...\"Yuder sighed, feeling both of his hands, as if they had been sliced and speckled by a blade, throb simultaneously.'No, let's not think too deeply. He must have said that hoping for this kind of reaction.'Showing signs of being disturbed was the worst thing one could do when facing an Awakener who could directly influence one's mind.Yuder breathed deeply and slightly rolled up his uniform sleeve. A very small red dot was visible on the inside of his left wrist, still bleeding. It was the seal he had imprinted when he made a pact with Kiolle earlier. After confirming its existence, he felt calm again.'The fact that this remains means Kiolle is not dead, which means the guy next to me is not an illusion.'There was no way the illusion would have chased him this far if Kiolle was already dead, using more of its illusionary ability on Yuder. Yuder turned his head towards Kiolle, who stood frozen, unable to utter a word.His foolish expression somehow felt like the most certain evidence that he wasn't an illusion, and Yuder found his mind somewhat more at ease.'I never thought I'd feel this way looking at his face.'\"Kiolle da Diarca.\"\"Why?\"Kiolle responded with a pale, scared face.\"Stay close behind me. The moment you separate, those bastards will kill you.\"\"Why would they want to kill me? Are they the ones who hold a grudge against Diarca?\"\"No, it's just that they really want to kill you because you're such a piece of trash.\"\"What...?\"Kiolle gaped, his facial expression cycling through myriad feelings of astonishment, as he looked back and forth between Yuder and Nahan.\"Still, you're trying to protect me, right? Then I...\"\"Of course I think you're trash too. I'm not protecting you because I like it, so just shut up and stay quiet.\"Worried about any possible misunderstanding, Yuder made sure to speak clearly. Kiolle retreated slowly with a somewhat shocked expression. Thankfully, after writing the vow, he seemed to obey orders a bit quicker.'Whether Nahan really used the deep illusion ability or not, I can't afford to waste more time here.'If it wasn't for the spreading speck on his right hand, Yuder would have been able to hold out until Nahan's 'time limit' is over and capture them all here.But that wasn't possible now. The pain spreading up his arm was certainly abnormal, indicating that the spot was moving upward. If this continued and it somehow interfered with his ability, it was clear what Nahan, who was quick to notice, would do.\"You're not giving up till the end, brother? How do you plan to escape my ability? Especially when you have no one to help you.\"Nahan tilted his head leisurely, as if watching the rebellion of a cornered prey.\"No matter how powerful an ability you have, if your sense of reality is breaking down, hitting me will become more and more difficult. An attack that can't hit is just a waste of power.\"He muttered, gently patting the head of the boy standing next to him.\"Just admit it now. Your head is getting increasingly dizzy and your body heavy, isn't it exhausting just to bear it? You've been looking quite strained since a while ago.\"As soon as Yuder heard his words, as if some magical incantation was spoken, his limbs grew heavier and his head began to spin again. He wondered if Nahan had noticed something amiss with his arm, but that didn't seem likely. Nonetheless, it was clear his condition was gradually deviating from normal.Yuder squinted as he felt an intensifying pain that felt like his entire shoulder was pulling downwards, stretching beyond his right elbow.\"Well... there's no need, really, to confirm it.\"\"What do you mean by that?\"\"This is what I mean.\"Nahan's expression subtly changed, as if he had sensed something. In response, Yuder clenched his fist instead of answering, drawing on all his strength.Suddenly, a massive pillar of fire erupted in front of Yuder. He felt the scream of Kiolle from behind him, accompanied by a deafening explosion.\"Aargh!\"At the same time, Yuder's right arm stiffened due to the most intense pain he'd ever experienced. The pain was so intense that it made him feel as if his vision was briefly whitening.Regardless of whether Kiolle was sprawled out and screaming, the flames summoned by Yuder surely incinerated the surroundings, spreading higher, ever higher. The vast and overpowering flames, which obscured the figures of Nahan and others in the distance, looked like a protective wall for Yuder.And when that fire eventually penetrated even the clouds and stretched high into the sky, Yuder felt his previously disoriented consciousness clear up, along with a sensation as if the opaque wall shielding him was breaking down, and the surrounding air became sharp.It was a sight similar to when he first met Nahan and he had dispelled the illusion cast over the vast area.'So my hunch was correct after all.'Nahan had continued to skillfully speak as if he had been using profound abilities solely on Yuder, but this wouldn't explain why Kiolle also continued to be under the same influence. However, Yuder remembered the fact that Nahan's ability initially affected a specific range.'There were many Awakeners before who could use more advanced abilities than their original ones under certain conditions. But it's difficult to think that these conditions are exactly as Nahan himself described.'If Nahan's advanced ability was not affecting a certain target as he claimed, but instead adjusting the range more freely than usual, everything would be explained.And for any ability that influences a specified range, the best way to break it is to shatter everything with an overwhelming power from within.That was something Yuder did best.'He must have felt the area of the illusion ability that had been covering us breaking, and he should realize there's no chance of winning since from that distance others could clearly see...'Then the only choice left was to run. Yuder believed that even in such a situation, he wouldn't be so obstinate as to insist on killing Kiolle.Just then, the ground shook violently and Kiolle screamed even louder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018It's a shame that I couldn't capture him and discern his identity, but it won't be the last chance.\u2019Nahan. As Yuder whispered this name, he recalled the man who exuded such a dangerously overwhelming aura. It was rare to remember a stranger one had met only once, but that man was vividly etched in his mind.\u2018But\u2026 considering that I am trembling all the way up to my shoulders\u2026 I'm worried about how Kishiar will react.\u2019He wasn't sure if it was his imagination, but it seemed as if he could hear his name being called from a distance. Yuder gradually extinguished the column of fire that had blazed hot enough to scorch his entire body.The forest, surprisingly pristine for a place where a massive fire had raged for quite a while, revealed itself. Kiolle, who had been crouching with his head down, slowly lifted his head and looked perplexed at the deserted scenery.\"Where did they go, those guys\u2026?\"Unlike Kiolle who was simply scanning the area, Yuder looked down at the few strange traces left on the ground. Seeing the ground seemingly forced open then covered again, he had an idea of the method Nahan and the boy might have used to escape.'A kid who can make friends, huh? I guess his friends aren't human.'Among the countless monsters that suddenly appeared on the continent, some had been accepted as unique native creatures, living almost harmlessly and hidden for a long time. The Rumvet, a monster that could always be found by digging deeply into any mountain, was one of them.The Rumvet, shaped like a giant worm, was harmless to humans as it only burrowed and lived underground. Yuder, through his long experience of monster extermination missions, knew several habits of the Rumvet.One of them was that it would block the entrance from the inside after burrowing into a tunnel, secreting a fluid that hardened the soil. Seeing the moist ground around him emitting a faint stinging smell, he was certain that a Rumvet had indeed burrowed out of the ground and returned not long ago.The ability to summon and control a monster hidden deep underground as if it were a friend was definitely a power worth risking danger to rescue for someone like Nahan.The earth's intense shaking after the creation of the fire pillar must have been due to that.'A monster-controlling Awakener... While it wasn't unheard of in my previous life, I've heard it's quite difficult to control a large monster like a Rumvet.'If he had the power to summon and control a giant monster so silently, why didn't he escape immediately while he was imprisoned? Was there a problem with using his ability?Remembering the silent boy, Yuder decided to also keep the boy's face in mind along with Nahan.\u201cYuder, Yuder!...\u201d At that moment, the urgent voices calling out Yuder's name were indeed real this time. They were the voices of Gakane, Jimmy, and Devran.He had anticipated someone would rush over upon seeing the fire pillar, but he was a little surprised that they hadn't left this place yet.'Did something else happen?'But the first thing he felt upon hearing his comrades' voices was a strange and clear sense of relief.\"Yuder!\"Gakane was the first to appear. His face turned pale as soon as he saw Yuder standing with his left hand cut by a knife and bleeding. Gakane, who had run at full speed, carefully lifted Yuder's hand.\"My goodness, was it you who conjured that column of fire earlier? But what in the world... who inflicted such a wound on you?\u201d\"I did.\u201d\"What?\u201d\"Both the fire and the wound, I caused them myself.\"\"Yuder!\u201dAs Yuder calmly responded, Gakane, doubting his own ears, stood in silence. Meanwhile, Jimmy, the second to emerge from the thicket, ran towards them with a worried look on his face but abruptly stopped upon noticing Kiolle, who was awkwardly standing in the rear.\"Uh...? That man... isn't he the knight from the Imperial Palace Knights? Why is he here? And in such a state...\u201dHearing the cautious words of the boy, Gakane turned and finally noticed Kiolle, wearing an astonished expression.\"You are...\u201d\"Uh, hem! Hem!\u201dUnable to discuss the events due to the vow he'd taken, Kiolle glanced at Yuder, coughing as if to prompt an explanation. The sight of him moments ago, terrified and prostrate on the ground, screaming, had long since vanished.Even though he was covered in dirt, far from his usual noble appearance, Yuder chose not to comment.\"I rescued him from the ones who had taken Devran.\"\"What? So, did you get hurt trying to save this man?\u201d\"...Somehow, yes.\"\"What? Yuder, you just said that you inflicted the wound on yourself. So, you hurt yourself to protect him? Why on earth?\"\"What? Gakane, what do you mean?\"\"Yuder said it himself.\"\"Does that mean\u2026\"Before Yuder could even respond, both Gakane and Jimmy, who'd quickly exchanged a conversation, fixed their fierce gaze on Kiolle. Yuder opened his mouth, watching as Kiolle visibly stiffened in surprise.\"That\u2019s not it\u2026\"\"What's going on, Gakane, Jimmy? Don't leave me behind. I still find it hard to run.\"Fortunately, Devran appeared at that moment, attracting everyone's attention.\"I saw a huge fire and thought something incredibly serious must have happened here, but it seems relatively peaceful. What happened?\"Meeting Devran for the first time in a few hours, Yuder noticed that his friend appeared much better, having changed into clean clothes and tended to his wounds.\"Yuder, where's that scarred guy who was with you? And who is this new person? What happened to those people in the cave you said you\u2019d deal with?\"\"It's a bit of a long story.\"Thinking of Nahan, Yuder felt his relaxing nerves sharpen once again. He sighed softly, turning his head towards the direction of the cave. Considering the events that had transpired, he needed to return as soon as possible.\"Things got a bit complicated.\"\"...Complicated? You didn\u2019t let them escape, did you?\"Devran, who bore a grudge against the people of the Apeto family, asked with a grim expression.\"No. They're all dead.\"\"Dead? Did you kill them?\"\"No.\"\"Then who\u2026\"As Devran paused mid-sentence, both Gakane and Jimmy also wore strange expressions.Looking at Yuder's unusually cold gaze, they inferred that the man who had vanished from here was likely the cause of the complication. Although they didn't know the specifics, it was clear that something significant had happened.Gakane, sensing the sudden change in atmosphere, donned a smile and looked around before speaking.\"Alright, now that we've found Yuder, let's head down for some healing first. We can chat about the details on the way.\"\"But before that.\"\"Hmm?\"Gakane turned his head towards Yuder, who had raised his hand to interrupt.\"Why are you still here? I thought I clearly told you to evacuate and not return to the village.\"\"Ah... that's the thing. Zakail's brother came back and the situation changed. Do you remember? That guy who was said to be in a relationship with Devran's sister\u2026\"\"...He came back?\"\"Yes. It seems Zakail tried to delay his return, but it actually sped up the man's arrival... Anyway, Zakail is locked up well. Considering we have injured, including Devran, it seemed better to rest and heal before leaving the village immediately...\"\u2018So that's what happened.\u2019 Yuder, hearing Gakane's brief explanation, quickly inferred the unfolding situation. He nodded in response to the story that wasn't too far from his own assumptions.\"Got it. And, Devran.\"\"Hmm?\"\"Did you see the two people who were tied up there while escaping?\"Devran nodded nonchalantly upon spotting the dropped gag and cord Yuder pointed to.\"Those guys? I saw them. When I came out, they were visible so I showed them some action and drove them out. Why do you ask?\"\"No. It's fine. As long as they escaped alive, it's good.\"It was fortunate amidst the misfortune that there were still people who could testify about what the Apeto family did here. They just needed to be found and apprehended.Yuder finally let go of the tension in his trembling arm. As he turned his head, Kiolle, who had been nervously waiting behind him, stepped back with a start.\"Kiolle.\"\"W-What. You, earlier, you were in a state of emergency so I didn't point it out, but if you keep casually calling my name...\"Even while failing to hide his fear, he attempted to reassert his authority in front of the others, which almost appeared pitiful. Yuder ignored his words and continued.\"You use informal language with me too.\"\"I do! Our statuses are different, and I'm older, so where do you get the nerve...!\"Just then, a tingling sensation pulsed from the mark of contract inscribed on Yuder's wrist. It seemed Kiolle felt the same as he abruptly closed his mouth and clenched his teeth.\"...Do as you please!\"In the end, he spat out those words with a face full of humiliation before sharply turning his head away. Of course, it wasn't Yuder's business to know.\"I intend to. Anyway, those who wanted to kill you are gone now, and it seems you won't forget our agreement. So for now, you should just head back as you are.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Return? In this state?\"Kiolle retorted in a voice thick with disbelief.\"How could I explain what happened here because of you? I have to speak of Paviel, who died\u2026\u201d\"That's for you to worry about. If word reaches my ear that there has been any suspicious movement from Diarca House in the vicinity of this place, then you\u2019ll find yourself sealed in a coffin, forever asleep.\"Looking at Yuder who murmured ominously, a curse of eternal sleep and eventual death, anger flared in Kiolle\u2019s eyes once again. Yet, the fear of the overwhelming force he faced remained alive within him.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter glancing at the faces of Yuder and the people around him, Kiolle slowly stepped backward. Moments later, he turned and sprinted away without a backwards glance.\"He acted so arrogant, but he couldn't move at Yuder's words.\"Jimmy sneered with a satisfied look on his face, watching Kiolle disappear. However, Gakane whispered something to Yuder with a somewhat uncomfortable expression.\"Is it okay to let him go just like that? If he talks nonsense about us after he returns, we might be challenged by Diarca House.\"\"No need to worry about it. He made an oath to keep his mouth shut in exchange for his life.\"\"An oath? You managed that in such a short time? Well\u2026 I trust you\u2019ve handled it, Yuder.\"Nodding in acceptance, Gakane's gaze then fell upon Yuder's arm.\"It seems like you're still bleeding. Are you feeling dizzy? Let's get moving.\"\"Yeah, let\u2019s go. If a person loses too much blood, they could faint.\"Yuder gave one last glance towards the cave entrance before heading down the mountain with his comrades. During the descent, he explained briefly about what had transpired in the cave. For a while, the three companions remained silent, apparently shocked.Jimmy couldn't comprehend Nahan's strange actions, Gakane deeply regretted not being at Yuder's side, and Devran was chilled by the words hinting that deeper darkness might be hidden behind the heinous acts committed by the Apeto family, targeting the Awakeners.However, they all agreed on one thing: they needed to report everything to Kishiar as soon as possible.\"You are Yuder Aile, the assistant to the Commander of the cavalry, aren't you? I've heard about you from the others.\"Upon his return to Hartan, Yuder immediately met with Zakail's brother, Zachlis. His physical condition wasn't the best, but it was tolerable considering the countless severe injuries he'd experienced in his previous life.Compared to then, when he could only receive treatment after reporting to the Emperor despite his serious injuries, he was relatively at ease. Currently, he sat comfortably, receiving treatment for a sword wound while having a conversation with Zachlis.Furthermore, Zachlis, unlike Zakail, was a man he could easily converse with.\"I'll get straight to the point. I love Dermilla, and I want her brother Devran to fare well as he is her family. I will do whatever it takes to achieve that.\"\"Does that mean, unlike the late lord, you won't support Diarca House?\"When Yuder asked directly, without any sugarcoating, Zachlis' eyes widened slightly before he nodded with a resolute look filling his good-natured face.\"Yes.\"This word was, in effect, Zachlis declaring that he could support the Cavalry and behind them, Duke Peletta Kishiar, and even further, the Emperor. If things were as they originally were, a single knight making such a statement wouldn't have been particularly interesting. But now, things were different.Zachlis Hartan was in a position to become the Lord of Hartan if he so wished. Even though Hartan was a small fief, it was undeniably one of the traditional and long-standing noble families of the East.Planting someone on his side at the center of the Eastern power base that supported the Diarca family wouldn't be a bad story for Kishiar or the Emperor.Moreover, if Zachlis were to become their ally, they could proceed with addressing the matter of Zakail and Apeto's collusion, and the issues caused by the Apeto family in the East, much more swiftly and easily.Having finished his calculations, Yuder nodded and met Zachlis' gaze directly.\"I understand. I will certainly convey your thoughts to our Commander. After we leave, the Commander will contact you directly. Until then, it would be best if you maintain a position no different from your previous Lord on the surface.\"In Yuder's words, implying that Zachlis should maintain a friendly demeanor towards the Diarca Duchy until contacted by Kishiar, Zachlis responded with a faint smile.\"Understood. Let's keep Zakail from coming out until then. If I find the two Awakeners who escaped as you mentioned, I will contact you.\"Yuder had asked Zachlis to search for the two mercenary Awakeners who had been beaten by Devran and had fled, and to monitor the vicinity of the cave where they had been hiding. Since everyone there had either died or fled, it was certain that the Apeto family would notice something amiss and start an investigation. They needed to find the escaped mercenaries before they did.\"Um... I've finished treating the wound on your left hand, but do you have any other injuries?\"Noticing that their conversation was about to wrap up, the physician cautiously interjected. Yuder looked at his bandaged left forearm and shook his head.\"I'm fine.\"\"Your right hand seems to be uncomfortable, too...\"Was it that noticeable? Yuder tried to ignore his right arm, which was still throbbing intermittently, and shook his head.\"I'm not uncomfortable. I'm fine. Why don't you go?\"\"Ah, okay...\"\"I'm going to get up now. I hope you rest well tonight and have a safe journey back.\"As the physician stood, Zachlis also rose. Yuder had already informed him that he would leave quietly early in the morning, so there was no need for formalities.After they had left, Yuder was alone in the bedroom. Since he had sent everyone else out on the pretext of talking with Zachlis, this was his only chance to check how far the spots on his right arm had spread.Yuder quickly removed his gloves and the top of his uniform and unbuttoned the undershirt he had worn underneath.'This is...'He had expected it, but the sight revealed under his clothes was absolutely grim. From the tips of his right fingers, over the elbow, all the way to the shoulder, his entire arm was completely stained with a dark purple hue. His forehead involuntarily wrinkled at the ominous color, resembling that of venom.\"It doesn't look good...\"However, there was one thing that differed from his expectations. The palm of his hand had turned a deep purple, almost black, while the area near his shoulder was a very pale violet. He wasn't sure why there was a color difference, but he made a mental note of it, since any piece of information might be useful.As he clenched and then released his fist, his arm spasmed again. Without thinking, Yuder gritted his teeth and exhaled. That was when it happened.\"Hey, Yuder. Are you done talking with Sir Zachlis? Listen to me for a moment. My sister, Dermilla, said she won't be going to the capital tomorrow...\"\"Yuder! I finished writing the report to send to the commander before we leave, could you check if there's anything missing...?\"\"...\"The moment Devran and Gakane, who had burst open the door and poked their faces in, saw his body and fell into silence, Yuder felt a rare sense of awkwardness.'I should have locked the door before undressing.'In his hurry to check the spots, he had completely forgotten. How was he going to explain the unusual purple spot, where it came from, how it appeared, and to what extent? It felt more difficult than facing someone who killed indiscriminately.------\"Guys, why haven't you said a word since we left until now? Did something happen while I was asleep?\"The group that left Hartan at dawn the next day kept riding without uttering a word until sunrise. Unlike the original plan, the other Awakeners they rescued from the cave of the Apeto family, as well as Devran's family, remained in the village. Devran was the only addition to the group, so their speed was remarkably fast.The reason was simple. It was because of the condition of Yuder's right arm, which was revealed last night.Yuder tried his best to explain the reason for the spot to Gakane and Devran, but it was no use. After all, Yuder himself knew nothing more than speculation that the spot was caused by the energy from the red stone.In the end, he roughly concluded that it had been like this since before he arrived here and that he had been trying to improve the condition with the methods that Commander Kishiar knew, as the treatment method was not yet clear.Gakane and Devran were silent for a while. Devran seemed to look at Yuder, who had come to save him despite such a terrible condition of his arm, as if seeing him anew. Gakane, who quickly guessed what \"before he came here\" meant, wore a complex expression. Yuder discreetly made a gesture to Gakane, avoiding Devran, and slightly shook his head. It meant not to mention it directly, no matter what he guessed. Fortunately, Gakane understood him immediately. After that, they decided to minimize the group, as they were doing now.'After all, since Sir Zachlis is in Hartan now, there's no need to worry about the families and others staying here for a while. But you... no way.''Yes, Yuder. I'll send the report as it is, so take a rest for now.'Because he was feeling slightly feverish again, Jimmy, who had gone to sleep early by himself, wasn't too surprised when they said that only four of them would go to the capital first, contrary to the plan. However, it was odd that everyone continued to ride without saying a word even after sunrise.\"There was nothing, Jimmy.\"Gakane forced a smile, but Jimmy wasn't easily placated.\"But... the way you keep leading on Yuder\u2019s horse, surely something must have happened, right? It's strange that everyone is so quiet, excluding me. It makes me feel left out.\"Ironically, Yuder, who had injured both arms, found it uncomfortable to hold the reins as tightly as he used to. Yuder himself didn't mind, but it was due to the objections of the others against him riding alone.'It's still better than riding together.'In fact, Gakane had suggested not just weaving the reins together, but actually sharing a ride. However, the horses were already too weak to accommodate two large men.\"Jimmy. You should be more concerned about your health. How's your fever?\"In the end, Yuder spoke up. Jimmy's slight fever had not subsided even after sleep, and had instead worsened. Whether it was because he thought that the tense mission was finally over, or because of some other factor, the boy's cheeks and forehead were still notably red.Before they set off, Yuder had felt Jimmy's forehead and had the feeling that the boy would soon truly manifest his second gender.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/TurningCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Don't worry, it should be fine until we head back.\"\"Speak up immediately if you feel the slightest discomfort.\"\"Okay...\"At the mention of his physical condition, Jimmy instantly fell silent. In this way, the party hastened their pace towards the capital.\"If nothing unforeseen happens, we should arrive soon. How are you feeling, Yuder?\"Riding alongside him, Gakane's voice was clearly audible. It was a question he'd asked several times before, but given Gakane's visibly worried expression, Yuder couldn't bring himself to tell him to stop asking.\"I'm fine.\"Although his answer implied that his condition hadn't worsened since the previous day due to not using his powers, Gakane, unaware of this, simply nodded in relief.\"I hope we can pass through the city gates quickly today. It's always so slow because of the sheer number of people in the capital.\"Although it was easy to leave the capital, entering was a different matter. It wasn't easy to pass through the security check by the capital's outermost guard.Unless one was of imperial lineage, even nobles had to undergo a thorough security check, and only after passing through this could they be allowed into the outermost part of the capital, towards the 7th wall.However, when the party finally reached the checkpoint, they realized their worries had been unfounded.\"Are you part of the Cavalry?\"A soldier, seeing them from the end of the long line in front of the checkpoint, approached and spoke to them after seeing their black uniforms.\"Ah, yes. We are.\"\"Do you have anything to prove your identity?\"At the soldier's query, Gakane showed him a button on his uniform sleeve. It appeared to be a regular metal button, but in reality, it was made from a magic stone that had been processed to resist any kind of shock.The soldier carefully examined the Cavalry emblem engraved on the button, then nodded and gestured towards the inside of the checkpoint.\"Your identity has been confirmed. Please proceed inside.\"\"Excuse me?\"\"When you arrive, you were to be directed there immediately.\"\"Directed?\"Gakane blinked in surprise, then glanced at Yuder. Yuder could feel his concealed arm throbbing and looked at the checkpoint building the soldier was indicating. There was only one reason that could allow such an exception.A person who could pass through the gates of the capital at will. In other words, it had to be an imperial command.\"...Let's go.\"Yuder began walking, putting strength in his legs to keep himself from stumbling. The party quickly followed after handing all their reins to the soldier.\"I wonder who gave such an order. It's not just to let us pass, but why are they asking us to go there...\"\"Don't worry. It must be someone we know.\"Yuder lightly patted Jimmy's shrunken shoulders before stepping into the checkpoint. Everyone inside seemed to have been cleared out in advance, leaving the interior eerily quiet. Yuder locked eyes with a man slowly rising from his seated position.A beautiful white face, wise red eyes under golden lashes.The moment their eyes met, the persistent pain in his arm was forgotten.\"Exactly, it's the third day.\"Not in his usual white uniform but dressed as befitting an imperial family member and a duke, Kishiar rose with a captivating smile in his eyes that could bewitch anyone.\"Congratulations on safely returning from your mission.\"\"Commander!\"Jimmy's startled cry echoed from behind Yuder. Only then did Yuder regain his bearings and, along with his other comrades, bowed his head in salute.\"How did you get here?\"\"Thanks to this final letter that arrived this morning.\"Kishiar lightly shook the letter he held in his hand, showing it off. It was the final letter written and sent by Gakane last night. Fortunately, Kishiar seemed to have received the letter in good time before their arrival.\"If it hadn't been for this, we might have missed each other. We were actually supposed to set off for Hartan today.\"\"You, Commander?\"At Devran's startled question, Kishiar nodded.\"I had the feeling that the situation wouldn't be normal, so I wanted to check it out myself. Thanks to my capable assistant who finished everything in just three days, I couldn't do that.\"Kishiar's gaze was still soft, as if joking, but Yuder thought that his demeanor seemed a bit different than usual.\"I figured there wouldn't be time to wait for an examination, so I ordered to call you here immediately upon your return. Perhaps it was an unnecessary consideration?\"\"No, not at all. We didn't know that you would personally come out... As you would know if you've read the letter, if you hadn't sent people to find me, I might not have even been able to return from the vacation and might have died. I am truly grateful for saving me and my family...\"The usually rugged Devran blushed awkwardly in front of Kishiar. At the sight of him, Jimmy couldn't help but cough to hide his laughter, and Gakane slightly bit his lip.Fortunately, Devran was too focused on Kishiar to notice his comrades' expressions.\"The thanks should go to your comrades, not me. Now, you should go back immediately. A carriage is waiting behind the checkpoint.\"\"Ah, yes, we understand!\"After Devran, Gakane, and Jimmy hurriedly left through the back door of the checkpoint, Yuder slowly followed them. Kishiar slowly approached him and opened his mouth in a low voice that no one else could hear.\"It spread to your shoulder.\"Even without a subject, Yuder immediately knew what he was talking about.\"That is the case.\"\"You were not the only Awakeners who went there, but you are the only one who came back injured. What am I supposed to think?\"His voice was soft but clearly lower than usual. Yuder remained silent for a moment before replying quietly.\"I apologize. I was careless.\"\"I didn't want to hear an apology.\"Kishiar's gaze shifted from the bandaged left arm to the seemingly healthy right arm. He didn't take his eyes off Yuder's right hand for a long time.\"Does it hurt?\"\"I can't deny it... It's a little painful compared to before... Ah!\"Before he could finish speaking, Kishiar suddenly grasped his right hand. It was a motion made without much strength, but as soon as he touched it, his entire right arm felt as if it was deeply pricked and throbbed painfully, making Yuder unconsciously clench his teeth.Seeing Yuder's slightly distorted face from bearing the pain, a shadow of concern passed over Kishiar's face.\"I made the right choice to wait here just in case...\"He released Yuder's hand. Yuder endured the tingling pain and looked up at Kishiar.\"We need to leave quickly. It seems we'll have a lot to do as soon as we get back.\"\"Welcome back.\"True to Kishiar's words, Nathan Zuckerman, his adjutant, slightly poked his head from the inside of the black carriage parked outside the checkpoint's back gate and greeted them.As Yuder climbed into the carriage, he remembered Kishiar's face from his dream. The real-life Kishiar was undoubtedly different from the one in his dream, a fact that was more pronounced now that they were face to face.Only then did it dawn on him that he was really back.'...Had I been anxious all this while?'He looked down at his own gloved hand and wondered this strange thought.He couldn't find an answer.------The cavalry building they returned to appeared as tranquil as ever. After directing Gakane, Devran, and Jimmy to rest in their respective quarters, Kishiar led Yuder to his own room.The top floor, where Kishiar resided, remained unchanged from three days prior. Walking past the magic stone stove, ablaze with colorful flames, and the Divine Sword Orr placed above it, Kishiar turned towards Nathan Zuckerman as they approached the sofa.\"Nathan, lock the door and bring the items I asked for this morning.\"\"Understood.\"\"Yuder, this way.\"Kishiar, who had taken off his gold-buttoned military blue coat and rolled up his shirt sleeves, called out to Yuder without hesitation. Seeing him not only roll up his sleeves but also undo his cravat, Yuder began to doubt what he intended to do.\"What are you planning to do?\"\"What else could I be doing?\"Kishiar retorted briefly and opened his mouth as he turned to Yuder.\"Aren't you undressing? Just rolling up the sleeves won't be enough to see how far the spot has spread.\"\"Ah, yes.\"Yuder sat on the sofa and took off his uniform. As was the case yesterday, his undressing was considerably slower than usual due to the injuries on both hands. After failing to undo the buttons twice, Kishiar, who was watching, frowned as if he had realized something.\"Ah, I see. Both arms... Put your hands down, I'll help.\"\"I'm fine. I can do it myself.\"\"Do I have to order you even for such things?\"There was nothing he could do once the word 'order' was mentioned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
