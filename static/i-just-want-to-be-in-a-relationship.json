    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: This character belongs to you.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the quiet audition field, the atmosphere was extremely tense.The actors who came for the audition already took their scripts, reading it painstakingly for each and every second, like they were students desperately cramming before their exams.Only Yu Qing Huan stood there without any emotion, with a blank and dull expression. Even the script in his hand, had drop to the ground without awareness. His action did not suit the current atmosphere at all.Even so, there were quite an amount of women with blushing faces, secretly looking over at him.The entertainment circle did not lacked any attractive people, but their beauty pales in comparison to Yu Qing Huan. His fine aquiline nose and exquisite eyebrow, together with a pair of exceptionally beautiful peach blossom eyes. His big eyes were bright with alluring black pupil, as if within lies a clear spring water, beautifully framed with long, thick eyelashes. When he gazed upon people with his slightly upturned lateral Canthus, with distinct and passion, it gave an indescribable feeling.In addition to his beautiful figure, was his straight and elegant posture. As he stood there alone, it's impossible for onlookers to remove their line of sight away from him.\"Qing Huan, this is your very first battle into the entertainment circle, you must perform your very best!\" Yu Qing Huan's Manager, Yu Xin was not in the mood to appreciate his own artist. He bent his waist and picked up the script, and stuffed it back into Qing Huan's hand. Yu Xin strongly encouraged Qing Huan again, \"When it is your turn, you must not be nervous, alright? Just pretend that those judges does not exist\uff01I will be outside cheering you on.\"Yet, Yu Qing Huan just stood there staring blankly into nothingness, not a single response to his manager's advice.Yu Xin did not felt that it was strange. He thought that Qing Huan was shocked silly by the scene in front of him. Yu Xin patted Qing Huan's shoulder and earnestly instructed him: \"Qing Huan na, to judge whether or not if your starting point is good, it depends on this battle ah.\"At this moment, Yu Qing Huan finally turned his head slightly. His eyes shot towards Yu Xin's face, and with a raspy voice he said, \"Yu-Xin?\"It's as if Yu Qing Huan used all his might to utter these two short words, inexhaustibly difficult. Like an old machine that was finally oiled, noisily starting to turned.\"Oh my ancestors!\" Yu Xin slapped his thigh. He felt extremely heartbroken by Qing Huan's negligence attitude towards his surrounding. Yu Xin couldn't take it anymore and pulled Qing Huan to a corner. He angrily snapped softly near Qing Huan's ear: \"You better quickly compose yourself, the director will not care whether its your first time or not. I painstakingly manage to snatch this opportunity for you. If you miss this chance, you will lose it forever. You take a look at those who come for this audition, there are even several debuted supporting actors. You are a newbie, if you don't act well, how will you fight with others...\"Yu Xin was still nagging non-stopped near his ear. Yu Qing Huan took a step back, and leaned on the cold surface of the wall. With a disbelieving look, he slowly and carefully took his surrounding in. Then, suddenly he used his entire arm strength to pinch his own thigh.A gut wrenching pain spread throughout his body. Yu Qing Huan shut his eyes, and slowly opened them again. The scenery in front of his eyes did not changed at all\uff01He got reborn! Really got reborn!After reaching the peak of the entertainment circle, he got reborn to ten years ago when he just turned 21 years old. Reborn to the moment he entered the entertainment circle.As for here, this place was the audition scene of the film, 'The Line of Life and Death'. The work of the famous director, Liu Jia An, accumulation of his 7 years aspirations.This film used combat medic as its concept, so at a time where youthful romance was the hit, the film was looked at with veiled criticism. People were scornfully criticizing and ridiculing the movie behind closed door. Many said that Liu Jia An, had already lost his mind and could no longer followed the trend of the entertainment field.When the film was released, many took Liu Jia An as a joke. They were waiting for his box office. Contrary to everyone's belief, even when 'The Line of Life and Death' had the least screen time, it ended up surprising everyone with its 5.5 billion dollars box office. It became the dark horse of the year. Even after the passage of several years, people couldn't help but to continue referencing the film.Yu Qing Huan was auditioning for the supporting third male lead called Ye Shang, a young doctor with good family background.Ye Shang became willfully arrogant because he grew up spoil rotten by his parents. He was also extremely greedy and deadly afraid of dying. Due to a mistake in the hospital name list, he was sent to the battlefield as an aid. In the process of a difficult situation, he began changing slowly. Finally in order to save a local girl, he was shot by a stray bullet and died.The setting of the character was tall, rich and handsome. In addition to having good image and great style, the character was also a doctor with white coat as a uniform. Ultimately set a trend of new generation male god wearing uniform. Although in the beginning Ye Shang was unpleasantly unbearable, but the end was an unforgettable scene that painted an indelible mark. That scene made sure that after the audience finished watching, it would leaved an emotionally deep impression.Nobody would dared to make noise, even if the film result was weak due to good established public relations and Liu Jia An's reputation. Precisely because of this, Yu Xin attached utmost importance towards Yu Qing Huan's current audition and made a point to accompany Qing Huan.In his previous lifetime, Yu Qing Huan did came for audition, but he didn't pass.The evaluation that Yu Jia An gave was: able to act, but not transparent enough.Yu Qing Huan was exceptional since young. Although it was his first time entering the entertainment circle, he thought that he was capable enough to get chosen because of his proud and arrogant heart. Far from being picked, he even met his Waterloo here. Thus, his mentality became unstable, and almost got depressed. Qing Huan spent a very long time getting out from this unexpected slum.Yu Xin was shocked by Qing Huan's action, and thought that he gave Qing Huan too much pressure. He hurriedly held Qing Huan's wrist. Using a gentle and careful tone, Yu Xin said, \"Qing Huan, don't listen to my reckless babbling, just take this audition as a test to familiarize yourself in this entertainment circle, alright!\"Yu Qing Huan looked at Yu Xin's thoughtful care. His heart felt warm at Yu Xin gentle action. Qing Huan carelessly set his script on a nearby stool, and said: \"Ge, let's go back, I don't think this character suits me.\"In his last life, he had no regrets towards the entertainment circle. Any award that could be won, he had won. Qing Huan had starred in many different big hit movie and had actually gather a huge group of fans oversea.Everyone that met him would respectfully called him Yu ge. His name could be counted as a famous household name.The only imperfection in his life was that even though he was in the entertainment circle, he never had any lover! He didn't even have any ambiguous relationship with anyone.Yu Qing Huan was naturally bent. After he entered the entertainment circle, there were eyes everywhere and everyone was waiting for his fall from grace. For the sake of his future, he listened to the company and manager. So Qing Huan kept a distance from everyone, he didn't dared to get too close, not even a bit.Until his death, he became known as the entertainment circle famous old virgin! It was really humiliating for Yu Qing Huan. He wanted to find a hole and buried himself!A short while after his rebirth, Yu Qing Huan decisively decided.Fuck his image! Fuck his future! He painstakingly regained a lifetime, now all he wanted to do was to have one hell of a love!Yu Qing Huan was no longer interested in walking the same path as he did during his last life. This time, any job that he can refused he would refused. He would minimized his appearance in the sight of public. He would wait for the expiration of his 5 year contract with the company and then quit immediately!Anyways he had the look and a degree. In this life, he was not afraid of not being able to obtain any job.He would looked for an adequate lover to settle down peacefully and normally, just like everybody else. This was Yu Qing Huan current biggest life goal!Hearing what Qing Huan said, Yu Xin almost lost his soul: \"What do you mean go back! Even if you are asked to act as a dummy today, you still have to act!\" He thought his artist had stage fright, so Yu Xin silently pondered in his heart. He decided when he went back later, he must planned a schedule, or else how would they overcome from being blindsided by any momentary psychological impact.\"Ge, listen to me.\" Yu Qing Huan's voice was extremely pleasant with its clear tone, really soothing to the ears. His voice was like a balm, could calmed people down, \"I am not afraid, it's just that yesterday I read and ponder the script thoroughly. Ye Shang, this person, in the beginning I could cope with forcefully. But in the later scene, with my present acting abilities, frankly speaking it's impossible.\"Yu Qing Huan felt grateful towards Yu Xin. Even though the man was slippery, Yu Xin was very good to him. Seeing that Qing Huan had no mother or father, no matter what Yu Xin would be considerably more caring.But Yu Qing Huan did not interacted with him for long. Several months after the audition for 'The Line of Life and Death', Yu Xin was sending a famous artist signed under him to an acting studio. He met an accident and died on the spot. Yu Qing Huan didn't managed to see him one last time.Fortunately, now was the chance to redo everything one more time.\"Ge, I feel that the most important thing to do right now is more tempering, after my acting become more mature, it's still not too late, or else I might drag everyone down.\"Yu Qing Huan said nonsensically with a serious demeanor.\"You don't give me sweet talks!\" Yu Xin narrowed his eyes, his face oozed disagreement. This was a rare opportunity after all. Even if he was uncertain, but his heart still held a silver of hope.Yu Xin display a face of indifference, but with Yu Qing Huan understanding, he keenly managed to capture a hint of doubt in Yu Xin's eyes. Qing Huan took an advantage while the iron is still hot, to earnestly persuade Yu Xin. He was too engrossed that he neglected the footsteps coming to him.Yu Xin was persuaded until his heart was in a mess. He was in no mood to turn back towards the direction of the footsteps.The two talked for a long time that Yu Qing Huan's throat almost dried up. Yet, he still couldn't move Yu Xin's heart.There was only a few people left at the audition field, this was Yu Qing Huan last chance. He looked at the number in his hand. If this continued on, it would be his turn soon.He could guaranteed that with his current acting skills, don't talked about the third male lead, the main male lead was also not a problem. So he cannot go for this audition. He had to be low key and slowly backed off the entertainment circle. This was his original intention.Just as Qing Huan trying to exert more effort to move Yu Xin's heart, suddenly a voice of praise came from behind, \"Not bad! Nowadays there are not many actors who can keep their initial intention ah!\"Yu Qing Huan and Yu Xin turned towards the voice and stopped simultaneously. The person who approached them was the director of 'The Line of Life and Death', Liu Jia An!\"Liu Jia An initially came out to take a breather. Most of the actors that came today have had their audition, but none of them made him felt satisfied! Either it a cunning, coquettish behavior, or a delicate small posturing deliberately acting strong and mighty, looking at those act made him felt disgusted.\"The Line of Life and Death\" was a film that he meticulously prepared for many years. In order to have total full control, even the investors were screened and cautiously chosen, let alone the actors.But he was aware that with his present charm as an outdated director, it would be impossible for the big fishes to come audition for the third male lead.Inviting those with good acting skills was impossible and those that could were not what he wanted.The more Liu Jia An thought about it, the more anxious he felt. He decided that there were no more need to see the later auditions. Just when he wanted to throw caution to the wind and tried to use his connection to find for an adequate substitute, he didn't expect to accidentally caught a conversation happening between Yu Qing Huan and Yu Xin.The young kid had a great look and good temperament. The most important thing was that he wasn't corrupted by vanity and fame. Even if his acting skills was a bit weak, with him as mentor, he could taught him and brought him up. It's hundred times better to have a hardworking newbie without achievements than using a friendly connection to bring someone in.In a split second, Liu Jia An made a decision.He looked at Yu Qing Huan number plate and took in his overall look. When the conflicted Yu Xin tentatively opened his mouth to greet him, Liu Jia An suddenly said: \"Acting cannot be learn behind closed door, following a good director is the most important of all.\"After Director Liu cease talking for a while, he smiled and regarded:\"I have been standing here listening for quite awhile. The little brat is transparent, free and sensible. It's suitable with Ye Shang's character setting in the later scenes. You don't have to audition, the role is yours.\"Yu Qing Huan: \"???\"Yu Xin:\"!!!\"Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2.1: I already Graduated from Primary School.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYu Qing Huan looked at Liu Jia An in disbelieve with his eyes wide opened, making his already small face became smaller. When Liu Jia An saw this, he showed a rare smile: \"Enough dallying. Follow me to the audition room for your part. I must figure out your acting skill properly, so that I can make proper arrangement.\"\"Director Liu, I don't think that's okay.\" Yu Qing Huan stood still at his place. He almost thought that he was hallucinating.What kind of luck was this! That Director Liu would accidentally overheard when Yu Qing Huan was persuading his manager. Because of that, Liu Jia An held him in high regard and generously just gave Yu Qing Huan the role!If this happened during his last life, he would be smiling even in his dreams. But it's different now, Yu Qing Huan didn't want to fly high. He had no thoughts of being famous. He only wanted to quit the entertainment circle and have a nice happy relationship, okay!But speaking of it, in his last life, his luck had always been horrible.When the film crew went around the country to promote the film, there would always be traffic jam as long as Yu Qing Huan was in the car; When his fellow actor got married and gave out Xi Tang[1], everyone would get good ones and only Yu Qing Huan would get an empty one; Even during eating time, of all the people at the table, only his bowl had worms inside.Some friends used to joke with Yu Qing Huan. With his 'good' luck, maybe he should go buy some lottery. In the beginning, Yu Qing Huan listened and kept trying. When not a single number was hit after so many tries, he completely gave up in buying lottery.Was it after his rebirth that he became incredibly lucky?He thoughtfully touched the back of his head.Liu Jia An looked at Yu Qing Huan face. He thought that Qing Huan was being embarrassed so his attitude became gentler, \"It's okay, I am the Director. Whatever I say, goes. Your name is Qing Huan, right? Come, follow me.\"It sounded like a wrench uncle trying to trick a little loli.While Yu Qing Huan was thinking up ways as to not offend Director Liu with his refusal, Yu Xin finally reacted. Looking at this huge pie that landed on his lap freely, his mouth couldn't close. He immediately dragged Yu Qing Huan towards the audition room and greeted Liu Jia An, \"Hello Director Liu. Our family [2] naive brat has always been like this. He's not rejecting you. This kid just enter the entertainment circle so he has no confidence in himself.\"Director Liu nodded his head; \"I know. I think like that is also quite good.\"The two of them began chatting excitedly completely ignored Yu Qing Huan who was standing beside them.Yu Qing Huan: \"...O-O\"It's not that he lacked confidence, it's just that he didn't want to act ah! QAQThe rest of the judges halfheartedly listened to the remaining actors after Director Liu leave the audition room. They hastily passed all the candidates and finally sighed tiredly at their place.Co-director Jiang Qi used the script as a fan. Fanning once then stopping once: \"Today work is in vain. Let's leave after packing, nowadays actors ah ze ze ze.\" Jiang Qi clicked his tongue.[T/N: \u5616\u5616\u5616 (ze ze ze): Similar intonation for when you clicked your tongue.]The producer who had a good relationship with him gave him a glance: \"Lao Jiang! Stop spreading your negativity. Who knows, maybe we will find a suitable one later.\"[T/N: \u8001 (lao): Old, sometimes used when addressing a good friend in Chinese. Ex: Old John. ]Jiang Qi shrugged him off and used one word to express himself: \"(( \uffe3\u3078\uffe3 ) / He-\"At this moment, Liu Jia An brought Yu Qing Huan inside the room. He raised up his hands and clapped twice, attracting everyone attention.Jiang Qi 'homemade fan' fell to the ground.The producer spat out a mouthful of tea.After a few seconds of silence, some were greeting him and some were wiping their eye glasses. Everyone wanted to see, who was this actor that could make Director Liu so satisfied.At their first glace. Wow, so handsome!When they took a closer look, everyone was stunned.Not every actor could stand the pressure of being scrutiny. They could see that the young man called Yu Qing Huan was not wearing any makeup at all with their godlike eyesight!This kind of beauty was simply unbelievable! The only thing that they didn't know was his acting abilities.They didn't know where did Director Liu found him. They also couldn't find anything relevant on the Internet.\"Well, Qing Huan.\" Director Liu sat on his chair and indicated that Yu Qing Huan should sit opposite him. After flipping through several pages of the script, Liu Jia An pointed to one of the dialogue and told Yu Qing Huan: \"Act these out for me.\"The chosen dialogue was the part where, after Ye Shang found out that he had to go to the battlefield, he made a huge ruckus inside the plane.Even though the difficulty level was not high, it was still a demanding scene for a newbie because once he was careless, the acting would seemed willful.Yu Qing Huan immediately knew how he should act when he sweep through the dialogue. When Yu Qing Huan failed in his audition in his last life, he flipped through the script countless times to hone himself. After the film was released, he also watched it thoroughly for numerous times. There was no other reason aside from his unwillingness to accept his failure.It could be said that Yu Qing Huan had eaten and fully chewed through the entire script a lot more compared to other actors.[T/N: had eaten and fully chewed: Fully comprehended the script]He really didn't want to act this role in this life. So now, should he deliberately act poorly and privately find Director Liu to quit later?His wishful thinking only lingered for a split second in his mind and was quickly discarded by Yu Qing Huan.Although he didn't want to enter the entertainment circle, he never wanted to fool others. Yu Qing Huan refused to leave an impression of having bad acting and cowardly image.After Director Liu finished talking, everyone was waiting for Yu Qing Huan to act but it was as if he lost his soul and didn't move for a long time.Jiang Qi secretly Wechat the producer: We cannot use this person.Producer: What is the Director trying to pull =.=? Which part he got attracted to? His face?Jiang Qi: Maybe. \u256e(\uffe3-\uffe3)\u256dProducer: I never thought there will be a day where Director Liu would use face to judge ah. \u3010/(\u256f\u2585\u2570) \\ Le sigh~\u3011Unlike the others who were being a contented bystander, Yu Xin was like an ant on hot pan. He really really want to strangle Yu Qing Huan neck so that he would hurry up and act.The mood in the audition room became weirder the longer Yu Qing Huan remained silent.

The arrogant and willful young master felt incredibly angry and he started shouting like a madman: \"I want to get off the plane! AT ONCE! NOW! Who would want to go to that damn place! Anyways, I am not going! I'm warning you, my parents are waiting for me at home. Do you know who are my parents ah.....\"The reason why he snapped was not only due to anger, but a larger part was because of fright.What kind of place was the battlefield? If you got careless, you would die. He still have a long beautiful future ahead with so much of wondrous things waiting for him. Why would he want to go to such a place where even the birds wouldn't dared to shit and throw his life away!Yu Qing Huan's acting was so emotionally on point that it's almost like he had became Ye Shang. He kept shouting and screaming with his whole might because he wanted to delay the plane from taking off. He refused to go to the battlefield.An array of complex and bountiful expression was beautifully acted by Yu Qing Huan. Even after he finished acting, everyone couldn't react as if their soul had flew away and hadn't came back.The Co-Director and producer saw the shock in each other eyes when they exchanged glances.This was a newbie? Don't speak nonsense! How could a newbie be so powerful!The acting was smooth and natural. It was a hundred, no a thousand times better than all the previous candidate combined together regardless of their experience! This kind of acting ability! This kind of powerful emotional control! Director Liu dared to say he was a newbie? His mother a newbie![T/N: \u4ed6\u5988 (ta ma) : Literally translate to 'His mother'. Chinese way of cursing someone. Means motherf**ker.]Director Liu couldn't care less about the questioning look or shock the others shot towards him because he was too preoccupied by the phrase in his heart: He had picked up a treasure!Everyone's attitude took a 180 degree turn and they quickly warmed up to Yu Qing Huan after his performance. Some even wanted to introduce their contacts to Yu Qing Huan after they found out that he had no assistant. Yu Xin couldn't helped but puffed up in pride as he slickly handled some inquiries.As a matter of fact, Yu Xin wasn't too happy in the beginning when the company pushed Yu Qing Huan to him. He was the top 1 graduate in the country, so what? He jumped grade several times, so what? This was the showbiz, not an exam room! \u256e(\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)\u256dYu Xin couldn't helped but soften after he learnt about Yu Qing Huan's background. His heart still held a silver of kindness even though he was an old fox.Yu Qing Huan was a lonely orphan who had to 'eat a hundred rice' while growing up. He had no choice but to jump two grades because he couldn't forked out the tuition fee for high school. Fortunately, he was intelligent. Yu Qing Huan managed to get number 1 in the provincial exam and was admitted to the best university in the country.[T/N: \u5403\u767e\u5bb6\u996d (chi bai jia fan) : Literally translated to eat a hundred rice. It means to grow up supported by aid. Harsher way of saying it is 'to beg'.]During his university days, he acted a lot because the drama club would earn money from each performances. In the end, Yu Qing Huan finally signed to their company due to poor judgment and was assigned under Yu Xin's care.At the moment, Yu Xin couldn't help but to rejoice in glee. He felt that he was lucky because of his barely existed sympathy that made him to give a chance to Yu Qing Huan or else he would lost a good seedling.\"Ge, you go back first. I want to stroll around.\" Yu Qing Huan suddenly announced while Yu Xin was lost in thoughts.Yu Xin blanked out for a second and then thought of when Yu Qing Huan became famous later on, it would be difficult for him to randomly strolled about. Yu Xin drove away in his old secondhand Audi after he warned Yu Qing Huan to be cautious of his surroundings.After Yu Xin's departure, Yu Qing Huan didn't go anywhere else and immediately went to a nearby lottery stand. He simply chose several numbers and bought ten notes.Although his luck was bad, but it was a fact that he managed to encounter rebirth. So, just in case!Then, he slipped the lottery notes into his pocket. Yu Qing Huan didn't flagged down a cab and casually took his own sweet time to walk around. In his previous life, he was always swarming with work. When he carefully thought back, Yu Qing Huan found that he never felt happy with life despite earning a lot.Yu Qing Huan didn't want to be a money making machine in his current life. He wanted to travel to the best place, see the best scenery, eat the best food and then find the best man to live a happy life together.As for the money, sufficient for him to use was good enough. Fame? He didn't need such unnecessary thing.The corner of Yu Qing Huan's lips slightly upturned. He found a pedestrian crossing and waited for the light to turn green so that he could cross. Suddenly, there was a riot at the other side of the road.A tall, lean man with straight posture apathetically stood in the middle of the road. The man never move regardless of how the cars kept honking at him. His behavior was causing a serious traffic jam.There were many drivers who stuck out their head and told him off. Their language was getting more and more vulgar. Didn't know whether the man was doing it deliberately or not, because he just wouldn't move.The pedestrian at the roadside was just watching the show unfolding and there were none who was willing to go and pulled the man away.When the traffic jam became worse, Yu Qing Huan couldn't take it any more. With a long stride he rushed towards the man, grabbed his wrist and quickly dragged him to the roadside.\"Red light means stop, Green means go. You know or not? Did you graduate from primary school?\" Yu Qing Huan grumpily reprimanded. He raised up his head and got stunned silly.The man was strikingly handsome with defined facial features and a sharp figure. Bearing a thigh length black windbreaker coat and a white dress shirt fully buttoned inside didn't make the man seemed old-fashion but it gave out a restrained air of manliness.Too bad he had poor mannerism. Such a waste of a good face.Yu Qing Huan felt woeful for a second in his heart and coldly regarded: \"The traffic almost got stuck because of you. You better obey the traffic rules when you cross the road next time, understand?\"The man just stared at him without a word.Yu Qing Huan suddenly felt annoyed. Was the man the type to be unrepentant even in death?Yu Qing Huan really couldn't tolerate those who looked like an upright and noble person but in actuality was a person with, 'My business is my business and your business is your business, so what I do is none of your business\" mentality. After Yu Qing Huan finished nagging and wanted to leave, the man suddenly grabbed the corner of his shirt.Yu Qing Huan turned his head and dully asked: \"What?\"Is it because of what he said made him unhappy? Now he wanted to fight?The man slightly drooped his eyes, his long thick eyelashes quivered. He seriously replied: \"I have graduated from primary school.\"Yu Qing Huan: \"...\"Yu Qing Huan: \"Okay, you graduated already. Now I know, so can you let me go?\"The man didn't let go and kept looking at him with his dark, profound eyes. He didn't know why but Yu Qing Huan managed to see that the man felt wronged.Yu Qing Huan: \"Anything else?\"The man: \"I respect the traffic laws, but I don't know how to cross the road.\"Yu Qing Huan:\"..._(\u00b4\u0f40`\u300d \u2220)_\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After he settled the man down at the roadside, he testily said: \"Here is good enough.\"Such a big man already but still dared to say that he didn't know how to cross the road. Today Yu Qing Huan wanted to do good to the end and see if he could pull anymore tricks.The man looked at his own hand, and then looked at Yu Qing Huan's hand. He just stood there without a world.Yu Qing Huan mentally scolded his unsociable personality. He combed through his wind-blown hair with his hand. His eyes brighten up when he swept through the area and saw a small shop selling a traditional style 'Shuang Pi Nai'.[T/N: \u53cc\u76ae\u5976 (Shuang Pi Nai) : Double layer milk.The winter in the northern area was dry and freezing. It was just perfect to have a bowl of warm delicious red bean 'Shuang Pi Nai' now.Thinking about its heavenly taste, he immediately threw the man aside and quickly walked into the small shop. It was during the working hours so the shop didn't have many customer. A few sweet looking young lady were hanging around the counter while chatting happily.Yu Qing Huan appreciated the scenery for a few second and regretfully shook his head. They were beautiful but such a pity that the gender was wrong.One of the lady saw that there was someone in the shop and immediately stopped chitchatting, \"May I take your orders?' Yu Qing Huan looked at her. His face red because of his rubbing.Yu Qing Huan didn't only have a handsome face, he was also classy. He leaned against the counter while smiling slightly. He was just looking at the menu but didn't know why did Yu Qing Huan suddenly seemed distinguished.A few ladies became bashful and their eyesight kept slipping towards him.\"One red bean 'Shuang Pi Nai' and one durian 'Shuang Pi Nai'.[T/N: Durian. A delicious fruit in certain Asian country. Famous for it smelliness XD. my favorite~]Yu Qing Huan only took a moment to decide his orders.\"Alright. Sir, please have a seat and wait for a moment.\" The young lady blushed and shyly replied but she retained her professionalism. After giving Yu Qing Huan his change, she lead him to the seat.Yu Qing Huan nodded his head and headed towards the seat by the window.At this time, the wind chime hanging on the door of the dessert shop rang. Yu Qing Huan didn't manage to see who was it, but his shirt suddenly tighten up and he had a bad premonition.Impossible right...Yu Qing Huan wearily turned his head and he really saw that man sinfully handsome face.\"What are you doing here?\" Several staff curiously looked their way and Yu Qing Huan hurriedly pulled the man towards the window and bitingly asked, \"Is it because you felt humiliated by my words and now you want to settle a score with me?\"What good luck! Maybe he was dreaming, or else how could he met a psychopathy the moment he took a step out the door.The man quietly stared at Yu Qing Huan without uttering a word.Yu Qing Huan felt irritated by the man's behavior and asked in agitation, \"Can't you speak? Are you dumb?\"This time the man responded swiftly, \"I'm not dumb.\"A 100% solemn look.Yu Qing Huan looked up to heaven angrily, he really want to punched someone.

You want to be my friend?\"Since young, Yu Qing Huan had many suitor of both gender by his side. The amount was too much to count. He never paid any attention to them because during his school days, he had to worry about his tuition fees and daily meals. Moreover he had to maintain his image after entering the showbiz.Even though you never eat pork, but you would have seen a pig run. When Yu Qing Huan saw the man apparent dependence on him, he guessed that the man wanted to chat him up.[T/N: \u6ca1\u5403\u8fc7\u732a\u8089\uff0c\u4e5f\u89c1\u8fc7\u732a\u8dd1 (mei chi guo zhu rou, ye jian guo zhu pao): Literal translation-Never eat pork, but seen a pig run. Meaning: Even though you have never personally experience something, but you have heard or seen about it.]His gaze lingered on the man's face with ambiguous eyes, like he used two furry paws to tickle people's heart. The young ladies at the distance couldn't help but feeling their heart beating faster, yet the man in front of him had no reaction whatsoever.On the contrary, the man frowned and hesitantly asked, \"What's the meaning of...to chat you up?\"Yu Qing Huan : \"( \u2299\u2026\u2299 )!!\"Is this person from Mars!?\"So why are you following me?\" Yu Qing Huan pulled out a chair and sat down. He scooped a spoonful of steaming hot 'Shuang Pi Nai' into his mouth. A thick flavorful milky taste embraced his taste buds and his anger faded away. Yu Qing Huan sighed and patiently asked again.\"I...\" Both of his hands were well-behaved on his thigh and it made him seem like a well trained big Wolf Dog. The man insecurely wilted down. He didn't dare to look into Yu Qing Huan's eyes and softly said, \"I lost my way.\"Yu Qing Huan ceased moving his spoon: \"So?\"\"Troubling you to send me home.\"Yu Qing Huan: \"( 0...0 )\"Ze ze ze. The young people nowadays really have many different ways to express their intentions. Didn't asked for WeChat and also didn't ask for phone number, straightaway wanted them to follow to their house. Did the man thought that he was stupid?Yu Qing Huan raised his delicate eyebrow and looked at the man. He extended his beautiful long clean hand: \"Phone.\"The man searched his pocket for almost half a day until he managed to find his phone. He casually placed his phone on Yu Qing Huan's hand.Yu Qing Huan looked down and stared. Wow, even using the newest Apple phone.\"Password.\"The man frowned and thought for a while. He shook his head while honestly replied, \"I don't remember already.\"Yu Qing Huan couldn't take it anymore and almost snapped in anger when the man suddenly lowered down his head and searched through his pack bag as if he recalled something. He dug out a small thin note book and freely gave it to Yu Qing Huan.What was this? Yu Qing Huan suppressed his rage. He held on to 'see what kind of elaborated tricks he wants to play' attitude, and turned over the pages of the book.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Each words were finely written. The spacing between sentences were concise and consistent. Yu Qing Huan could see that the owner of the writing had strong Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder(OCD).What made Yu Qing Huan stunned was not because of the writing but its content.Hand phone password, email password, and even his bank card password was written clearly.He raised his head and looked at the man. Yu Qing Huan lamented in his heart. Was he an idiot? Could bank card password be given freely to a stranger?'Yu Qing Huan followed the password recorded in the book to open the man's phone. He didn't know why the it was on flight mode but the phone interface was incredibly clean. Even the factory app was move to a separate folder. The only thing remaining was a navigation app.So...This person was really bad at direction? He wasn't intentionally trying to chat him up?Yu Qing Huan couldn't help but soften his look. He first checked his phone's log, but there was nothing. So he could only opened the navigation app and asked: \"House address.\"The man rapidly fired out a string of address, as if afraid that he would scolded again.The man's address was at the city first rate villa area and those who could stay there were wealthy and respectable people only. In his last life, Yu Qing Huan only managed to be qualify to buy a villa there after struggling so hard for so long. Unfortunately before he could buy, he got reborn.Thinking about it, he couldn't help but felt hatred towards the rich and glared at the man. The man was glared stiff and apprehensively took a step back. Yet, his hand still obediently stuck to his side.Yu Qing Huan: \"...\"He entered the man's address into the navigation app, enlarged the page and carefully recited the route to him. Yu Qing Huan pointed outside the window: \"There are cabs outside, you just let the driver follow this route.\"The man didn't move.Yu Qing Huan, \"What's wrong?\"The man peeked at him and quickly reverted his eyes, as if he felt wronged.Yu Qing Huan: \"Speak ah! What's wrong with you?\"The man drooped his head and his pitiful hair was blew to aside, \"I don't know how to get a cab.\"Yu Qing Huan: \"...^_^\"Yu Qing Huan: \"Don't know how to cross road, don't know how to get a cab, don't remember your own password. Let me asked you what do you know? Do you know your own name or not?\"The man opened his mouth and sulkily said, \"I remember my name. I'm Huo Qu.\"Yu Qing Huan sneered sarcastically, \"Oh, it's wonderful that you can remember your own name. Do you want ge ge to award you? Give a you kiss kiss, hug hug and lift you up high high ah?Huo Qu was stupefied. Then bit by bit his face turned red and spread to his white ears.\"Alright, today I will do good until the end.\" Yu Qing Huan cleanly finished the last spoonful of the red bean 'Shuang Pi Nai and looked at Huo Qu, \"Wait for me to finish eating first then I will send you home.\"After going through a series of probing, Yu Qing Huan could see that Huo Qu really wasn't faking anything. He really didn't know how to recognize road and get a cab.What kind of family was it to be able to bring up such a young master ah! This should be the rumored legendary rich man's disease ba.Yu Qing Huan shook his head. He was just about to take the another bowl of 'Shuang Pi Nai', when suddenly 'Gu Lu~', a loud rumbling noise came from where Huo Qu was sitting.Yu Qing Huan stared blankly (O.O), Huo Qu also stared blankly (O.O).\"Don't tell me that you haven't eaten for a few days?\" Yu Qing Huan happily basked in someone misfortune and his pair of peach blossom eyes curved up. \"Come, I give you eat this bowl of 'Shuang Pi Nai' ba.\"Huo Qu's face turned redder. His eyes frantically looked around and he didn't dare to look eye to eye with Yu Qing Huan, but he still honestly answered his question, \"Since morning until now.\"It was already more than 6 o'clock in the evening, and this person actually didn't eat the entire day.Yu Qing Huan sighed and waved his hand to request for another clean spoon. He stuffed it into Huo Qu's hand and said, \"Faster eat, what else do you want? This time I treat you.\"Huo Qu shook his head and stiffly held the spoon to scoop the 'Shuang Pi Nai'. Such an easy task, but didn't know why when he tried, it looked extremely awkward. After trying a few times then he could scoop up something.Yu Qing Huan found it fascinating. He was full of interest, so he watched Huo Qu attentively until smoke almost came out from his head. Only then Yu Qing Huan had the conscience to move his line of sight.Even though Huo Qu's house was at a villa area, it wasn't far. Such an exceptional place surrounded by the mountains and river, so it was very famous in the city. The cab driver already knew of the location when he heard the name of the place and he absolutely didn't have to use the navigation app.Yu Qing Huan and the driver were talking happily while Huo Qu never opened his mouth. He was sitting there silently with his back pencil straight and his hands on his knees, just like a student waiting for the teacher to spot checked his hygiene.Yu Qing Huan sneakily glanced at Huo Qu. He felt tickled by the scene and burst out laughing.The villa area was inaccessible by the cab so they could only stopped at the entrance. Yu Qing Huan took Huo Qu's little notebook and flipped through it. Searching through the list of contact number, he told Huo Qu: \"I send you until here. If you still couldn't find your way back, give a call to the number of your brother, father and mother listed here. Ask them to fetch you back.\"When Yu Qing Huan saw Huo Qu earnestly listened with a serious look, he continued: \"As soon as you reach home, you go rest nicely after finish eating. Okay, I'll go first~\"Yu Qing Huan paid the cab fee once he finished talking. He opened the door and waved goodbye to Huo Qu. Very quickly, Yu Qing Huan's back disappeared in the throng of crowd.Huo Qu sat quietly in the cab for a full minute and only started clumsily unleashing the seat belt when the driver urged him to get off his car.While he was sliding past to where Yu Qing Huan previously sat, he found a sticky note. He used his hand to pick it up and only saw two small words in black, indicated: No. 29, Yu Qing Huan.Yu Qing Huan, Qing Huan.Huo Qu carefully inserted the sticky note into his bag. After a moment of consideration, Huo Qu gently picked the note up, like it was a priceless treasure to cherish and cautiously inserted the note into his coat pocket.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the he had to open his little notebook and gave a call to his home phone.Huo fu ren(madam) was sitting in the living room with tears rolling down her cheeks. Without further ado, she hurriedly embraced her youngest son the moment she saw him, not waiting for Huo Qu to finish taking off his shoes. She kept crying out her beloved baby and her tears soaked through Huo Qu's shirt.\"We have drivers at home but you stubbornly want to go to the research lab by yourself! Don't you know how worry I was the entire day. I was scared to death that you'll meet with an accident! I can't even take a single bite!\"Huo Qu went stiff. He looked at his mother without knowing what to do and his mouth sew shut never uttering a single word.Huo fu ren swept away pieces of hair from her youngest son's forehead and lightly tweaked his nose.Her youngest son was really intelligent. At the age of 20, he had achieved double PhD and entered a research institution. He had also received countless award overseas and numerous institutions were vying to snatch him up. It could be said that he was the leading scientist in the field of Mathematical physics.However, it's just that he wasn't even comparable to a 3 years old in life.Didn't know how to boil water and couldn't recognize route. Not only that, he couldn't take the public transportation nor could he get a cab.One glance at complex element and he could already stored it in his brain, but he couldn't remember the basic of living knowledge. It was useless no matter how much they tried to teach him.\"Don't do this next time, okay?\" When Huo fu ren saw Huo Qu lowered down his head with a muddled look, regardless of how anger she was, Huo fu ren had no choice but to bear with it. She could only insistently demanded by faking a stern expression.\"Enough, our son already come back. You say those things for what.\" Huo ba(father/sir) moved to her side and wiped her tears, \"Crying like this in front of our child, you don't feel embarrass ah.\"Huo fu ren glared at him and viciously pinched his hand, \"My own son, I say a few things also cannot?\"\"Can can can, my mistake.\" Huo ba was pinched to the point of grimacing in pain but he didn't cry out. He smoothly apologized after hearing what his wife said and finally made her turned tears into laughter.Huo ba shifted his body towards Huo Qu and lightly said, \"San-er, you go back to your room first and wait for me to tell Aunty Lee to send up some food.\"[T/N: \u4e09\u513f (san-er):Meaning third born, but in affectionate view with the usage of -er.]Huo Qu had been waiting for that command, impatiently nodded his head and briskly headed to his room.Looking at his son's lean straight back, Huo ba couldn't help but to sigh.He had three son. The eldest, Huo Zheng and the second, Huo Rong were twins. Huo Zheng took over his business and walked the same career path as Huo ba had. Huo Zheng could mingle in the political circle with ease. On the other hand, Huo Rong chose commerce. Only a couple of years but he had created quite a number of commercial legend and was also rather famous in the country, so Huo ba didn't have to feel worried.The one that made him anxious was Huo Qu, his youngest son.\"Lao Huo, our san-er can't go on like this,\" Huo fu ren said to her partner while wiping her tears:\"Do you know that my heart was in a mess the entire day. I was too scare that he will knock or hit something. We give san-er a few more bodyguard ba.\"Huo ba shook his head,\"San-er already has a lot of bodyguard. Losing him today was an accident, we see first ba.\"They had always been humble even though Huo Jia(House) was powerful. Besides, their bodyguards were selected for their quality rather than quantity so hiring more would be useless.Huo Jia Fu(Father) Mu(Mother) were talking downstairs, while Huo Qu was sitting in his room, looking at the number on the note in daze. When Aunty Lee sent food and swept a glance across the room, she didn't find it odd.Youngest master had been like that since young, always lost in his own world. He gave no reactions whatsoever to the outside world, to the point of forgetting to eat.Aunty Lee put the food at the door. She was about to holler at Huo Qu to eat when Huo Zhong and Huo Rong passed by. They stealthily looked inside their little brother's room.\"Ge, xiao di(little brother) is daydreaming again.\" Huo Rong sighed and raised his feet, wanted to enter the room but suddenly recalled his little brother's OCD-ness. He didn't dare to go in the end and could only silently whispered in Huo Zhong's ear.\"I will give a call to the research institute later and ask for a few days leave for xiao di.\" Huo Zhong rubbed his temple, his eyes full of worry towards his littlest brother.Huo Rong instantly shook his head: \"Take leave is useless, he's the same even at home.\" After stopping awhile, he continued saying: \"Ge, I want to discuss something with you. I want to bring xiao di to my company to stroll around.\"Huo Rong's company was called Xing Guang(Star Light), and was the country most famous entertainment corporation. Movie emperor and empress were breeding like flies. It was a holy realm that many aspiring actors trying to crack opened their head to squeeze in.\"Don't you dare think about it.\" Huo Zhong berated him: \"Those kind of murky atmosphere in the showbiz, what if they swindle xiao di!\"Huo Rong thought it through and could only changed his mind. When they wanted to quietly walked away, Huo Qu suddenly raised his head and looked at them.Huo Rong's heart melted when his family youngest brother looked at them cutely, \"What's wrong, san-er~(\u3065\uffe3 \u00b3\uffe3)\u3065\"Upon seeing that \u03a3(\u3063\u00b0\u25a1\u00b0;)\u3063, Huo Zhong quickly push his er di(second brother) away and stretched his neck to look into the room, \"Xiao(small/young) Qu, do you need big brother's help with something?\"At first they thought he wouldn't respond but Huo Qu suddenly nodded his head slowly. He then raised his hand and showed a piece of paper in his palm, \"What is this?\"Xiao di willingly talked to them! \\(T ^ T)/Both siblings jolted in shock and simultaneously looked at Huo Qu's palm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No only that, there was a small symbol of Xing Guang Entertainment below the name Yu Qing Huan. This proved that this person belonged to his company.Where did xiao di (little bro) know this person? Could it be that, that person knew xiao di identity, so purposely wanted to approach him?In a blink of an eye, Huo Rong's brain went through many different scenarios and told what he knew to Huo Zhong. Huo Zhong intensely probed about the origin of the note.Unfortunately, Huo Qu was a person who would put aside something after finished using it. Once he found out what he wanted, he ignored his two brothers.Hao Qu shut his door with a bang while ignoring the probing gaze from them. With his head down, he lightly and carefully rubbed the number. Didn't know what he was thinking about.On the other hand, Yu Qing Huan was eating a bowl of piping hot beef noodle outside. Only after finishing, he went back to the company.Yu Xin was already waiting for Yu Qing Huan since earlier. The moment he saw Yu Qing Huan, Yu Xin immediately walked towards him and stuffed a thick script into his hand,\"You finally come back. I waited for you for almost half a day. This is the script that Director Liu give, you better train properly and don't do too many NG.\"\"Ge, you already remind me a lot of time.\" Yu Qing Huan took the script and walked to his sofa while replying without energy.\"It's for your own good!\" Yu Xin raised his hand to hit the back of Yu Qing Huan's head, but Yu Qing Huan only grinned and dodged it. Yu Xin felt helpless, \"I say you, such a good opportunity, if it's someone else, long time ago already burst with joy. But you, one reaction also don't have.\"Obviously before the audition, this kid was rubbing his fist and wiping his palm, preparing to go out all in one shot but how come after the audition succeeded, he became at peace with himself.[T/N: \u6469\u62f3\u64e6\u638c (mo quan ca zhang): Idiom - to rub one's fist and wipe one's palm.

Meaning: Feeling calm or at ease.]\"It end up with that outcome anyway, happy or not is the same. \" Yu Qing Huan fished out two lottery ticket from his pocket and slapped it on the coffee table with a bang, \"Ge, if my lottery ticket win 5 million, I will provide for you to become my exclusive manager.\"\"Let it drop, okay.\" Yu Xin rolled his eyes, \"5 million is what? You see that more or less like you small fresh meat, one TV drama already a few millions, rather than depending on lottery, why don't you take acting seriously.\"But Yu Xin's heart felt a little touch. This kid, although couldn't see from his face, but who was kind to him, his heart could see with clarity.As Yu Xin said this, he suddenly remembered something, he slapped the back of his head and said: \"Got sidetrack by you, I almost forget to tell you. Tomorrow follow me to your Alma mater for a while.

He stood up, not giving Yu Qing Huan any opportunity to reject, Yu Xin urged him to sleep early and then left.After Yu Xin left, Yu Qing Huan sat at the sofa thinking for a long time. In his last life, there were no such thing, but after he went through the audition, his life trajectory seems to deviate further away from his previous lifetime.He didn't want to continue mingling in the entertainment circle anymore, but things seems to refuse to be controlled.Yu Qing Huan rubbed his slightly swelling temple and threw away the messy thoughts in his head. Forget about it, take one step at a time ba.The next day early in the morning, Yu Qing Huan was dig out of from his nest. He wore the clothes prepared by Yu Xin long ago and left to school with blurry eyes.In the end, when they just stepped out, they encountered Gao Yun Cheng and his manager. Both were tag along by a group of assistants and cameras, rushing from outside, didn't know what they were doing.Gao Yun Cheng debuted 2 years earlier than Yu Qing Huan, resources were not bad and he acted in two idol drama. His family manager created a honest and just image for Gao Yun Cheng, everyday in Weibo hate heaven hate earth, but a pity that the response was lukewarm and not popular.[T/N: \u603c\u5929\u603c\u5730 (dui tian dui di): Chinese slang for being hateful and criticizing of everyone.]Gao Yun Cheng had went to the audition for the third male lead of 'The Line of Life and Death'. But the result, he only managed to say a few lines before Director Liu kicked him out.So when he found out that Yu Qing Huan passed the audition, Gao Yun Cheng couldn't restrain his anger.He had an uncleared relationship with a small higher-up in Xing Guang, and got to know about the work that Yu Xin gave Yu Qing Huan first. In order to make Yu Qing Huan felt uncomfortable, he immediately ran to Hua Da for a photoshoot early in the morning. After the expert finished retouching the pictures, Gao Yun Cheng quickly post them to Weibo. Then the topic about \"Gao Yun Cheng National Xiao Cao\" already became a hit.[T/N: \u56fd\u6c11\u6821\u8349 (guo ming xiao cao): National handsome man.]\"Going for photoshoot?\" Gao Yun Cheng, with an untamed styled black hair and cold expression, looked at Yu Qing Huan, \"This morning haven't see Weibo ba, the people from small area are small minded and used to picking up other's leftover to eat!\"When Yu Xin heard this words, he immediately knew something was up. He shakily pulled out his phone to see and suddenly felt angry until he was spouting smoke through his seven orifices. Yu Xin never thought that Gao Yun Cheng and his team would do this and now in Weibo, everywhere was discussing about Gao Yun Cheng, the national xiao cao. They even advertised the damned thing!Even though this trick wasn't that brilliant, but a toad landed on one's foot, it didn't bite but one still felt threaten by it!Yu Qing Huan didn't even felt a thing because when he was shining brilliantly at the top in his previous life, the showbiz didn't have this person called Gao Yun Cheng. He looked at Gao Yun Cheng with an unwavering expression and lightly remarked: \"National xiao cao?\"\"What? You can but others cannot?\" Gao Yun Cheng thought that he succeeded in infuriating Yu Qing Huan, so he proudly raised his chin with his eyes full of provocation.Yu Qing Huan spread his hands without a care, \"Of course, but I feel that there's a part that you write wrongly in Weibo.\"What? There was a mistake?Gao Yun Cheng immediately panicked after he heard what Yu Qing Huan said. He hurriedly fished out his phone to find his wire copy and rapidly went through it once.There were no typo mistake and also didn't have anything inappropriate. Everything was praising his coolness.Gao Yun Cheng raised his head angrily. He was just about to mock Yu Qing Huan's low tolerance and wanted to play Yu Qing Huan, when he suddenly heard Yu Qing Huan calmly said: \"You see this, here write Hua Da Xiao Cao[\u534e\u5927\u6821\u8349(school)].

For Gao Yun Cheng, the biggest impression Yu Qing Huan gave was robbing his movie role. As for Yu Qing Huan's personal details, he didn't know anything at all.In the entertainment circle, there were artists with high academic qualifications, but not many. That was why Gao Yun Cheng could say it so confidently.Unexpectedly, his words barely sank in, when Yu Qing Huan nodded his head, \"Yup, I am. How do you know?\"The criticism that Gao Yun Cheng was holding in got stuck in his throat, couldn't go up and couldn't come down. It made him choked in pain.This Yu Qing Huan actually really graduated from Hua Da? Impossible, must be lying ba!He clenched his fist tightly, wanted to say something but his mind was a blank. Searching for half a day also couldn't spit out a single word and just stood there facing Yu Qing Huan who was calm and collected. Gao Yun Cheng felt humiliated.Yu Qing Huan admired his posturing for a bit and satisfyingly tugged Yu Xin back to the dormitory.Yu Xin shockingly maintained his self-restrain outside. The moment he stepped inside the house he started roasting someone with Yu Qing Huan: \"What the hell! Only selling his ass! Really think himself as a male lead! I want to see him fry!

Name represent their heritage so for them to say that; means that either they're super mad at you or sometimes they're too impressed by you. There are different ways to interpret this phrase depending on sentences.]Gao Yun Cheng team dared to obstruct them halfway so openly and without fear, obviously they didn't put him in their eyes. Thought that he was a mellowed soft persimmon, could pinch just that.Yu Xin gritted his molar teeth, nearly bleeding from his eyes in hate.He had mixed in the showbiz for more than 20 years, the people that went in at the same time had already became gold tier manager. Even if they were a little inept, they would still have one or two big flower(big shot) in their hands. Every year they could just pulled out achievements until their hands went limp in exhaustion.Only him. The most famous under him was just a second rate artist. Not only that, his contract with the company would end this year.Yu Xin originally already 'took trouble to heart'(brooding) regarding his situation and now Gao Yun Cheng did this to them, it's simply putting Yu Xin's ego under his feet to stomp on and even exerting strength to stomp a few times!Yu Xin was angry to the point of breathing heavily, his face that always carried a smile turned ashen.\"Ge, you drink some water to calm down.\" Yu Qing Huan threw him a bottle of water and unscrewed one to take a sip himself, 'Don't make yourself too angry.\"\"Ai, you don't understand.\" Yu Xin gulped down half a bottle of icy cold water and gripped his head. He used his strength to scratch his head a few times, after a while he discouragingly breathe out, \"I'm so disappointing.\"The showbiz had always been a, to trample someone under their foot and praising others place. Although he was familiar with the rule, Yu Xin still felt that it was difficult to bear in his heart.\"Ge, don't ah,\" Yu Qing Huan walked towards Yu Xin and shifted him. He hugged Yu Xin with good brotherly feelings, \"I'm someone who will walk a high-end route, don't need to compare with that kind of trying to hype but cannot be popular person.\"Yu Xin stared blankly, \"What high end?\"\"Ge, you listen to my analysis ah.\" Yu Qing Huan playfully narrowed his eyes like a fox and started to brainwash Yu Xin, \"You see now in the showbiz, what national male god, national goddesses, everything has already been marketed. We market also cannot market anything out. Might as well just don't do anything...\"Before Yu Qing Huan could finish talking, Yu Xin already shook his head, \"No way, no way. So many news this year, if there's no exposure the audience will forget about you after 3 days.\"Yu Qing Huan was in no rush to refute him, rather he said: \"I'm not saying that I don't want to show my face, but I want to walk another path. You looked at Weibo hot search, all about that who is crying, that who is laughing, or that who is eating potato chips. Don't talk about others, even when I see it, I also feel it's tiring and unbearable.\"Saying like that was not wrong actually. Now in the trending search, sometimes when clicked open to see, some of the related queries were detrimental things.Yu Xin couldn't help but nodded his head, \"You keep talking.\"Yu Qing Huan: \"So we don't need to market. Even though the number of national male god haven't reach a hundred, but there's still at least 80. Lacking me also doesn't matter. Might as well do the opposite. Don't market, don't post in Weibo.

If Yu Qing Huan said that he didn't want to take on anymore job and straightaway quit, he was afraid that Yu Xin would burst on the spot.Dealing with the mess so well today couldn't be any better, Yu Qing Huan didn't need to offend Yu Xin, and he also didn't need to think hard about getting exposure to raise to fame. Simply perfect. But speaking about that, he had to thank Gao Yun Cheng for it.Gao Yun Cheng didn't receive Yu Qing Huan's gratefulness. He was nesting inside his own apartment, releasing his anger at his assistant.\"How do you do things? Everyone in Weibo is calling me a chestnut! Say I really know how to hype! Where's the water army? Where's the PR? You don't call them up but show your sullen face and follow me here for what?[T/N: Chestnut: It is actually a slang for joke.]Gao Yun Cheng was mad until his nose almost went askew. Obviously in the morning, the topic was still okay and many were praising his handsomeness. So much so that his fan base expanded by tens and thousand of people. But how come after only an hour, the direction of public opinion changed!Didn't know who raised up their head first and said his acting skill was non-existent. The real person's face was full of bruising that he could only continued to resolutely relied on hyping himself. They even listed out his previous entry in the hot search, and ridiculed Gao Yun Cheng wantonly.Gao Yun Cheng had a fiery temper and was extremely conceited. He always thought that he was the most handsome man in the world and that, the reason why he was not famous because he had talent but no opportunity. Usually when someone said that he was bad, he would calculate for a few days, let alone in such a big scale.[T/N: calculate: Being calculative to someone; bearing grudge.]His assistant was scolded until he was fill with fear and trepidation, just like a partridge, he shrank his neck and didn't dare to move. But he felt endless indignant in his heart.Clearly Gao Yun Cheng was the one that bought the hot search. When something went wrong, Gao Yun Cheng would blamed him. If not because he was still baring his house load, he would have quit a long time ago! What a horrible person! Served this bastard right that he wasn't famous! Pei!He waited until Gao Yun Cheng finally felt tired from scolding him and then dug out his phone. He wanted to see the movement in Weibo and figured out ways to recover public opinions, but he never expected that with one look, he would become dumbfounded.He didn't know since when that the topic 'National Male God' got diverted from Gao Yun Cheng to another person and this person, was the one that made Gao Yun Cheng felt hatred until his teeth itched, Yu Qing Huan!This matter was actually quite mysterious. The reason was that an anime blogger saw the 'Gao Yun Cheng National Male God' topic and posted in Weibo.San San Niang De Shui Shou Fu: #Gao Yun Cheng National Male God# Early in the morning when I saw this topic, I almost think that I go to wrong place in Weibo. Gao Yun Cheng is Hua Da what ghost! Our Hua Da have no such person. The only one in our school that can be called Male God is the xiao shi ge(little senior) of journalism department! Attached are the sneak shot of the xiao shi ge [Picture] [Picture]. Gao Yun Cheng's fans, please don't curse too offensively. Just saying in passing, xiao shi ge jump two grade in high school and directly participate in the college entrance exam. He finally join our school with the title of Provincial Liberal Art Top Scorer. [Dog Head][T/N: San San Niang De Shui Shou Fu: San(Three) San(Three) Niang(Lady's) Shui Shou(Sailor) Fu(suit).]In that particular year, there were no shortage of people with good looks, but if you added on high IQ and higher education qualification on top of having really good look, then it was a different case.In addition to that, the blogger originally already had several hundred thousand fan, so when the post came out in Weibo, it immediately caused an uproar.\"My heaven, how can this xiao ge ge(little brother) still look so handsome wearing school uniform!\"\"Ao ao ao~ xiao ge ge so so so handsome *lick lick lick*!\"\"This is indeed a national male god! Exactly like the boy of my heart, this old lady's maiden heart ah.\"\"So bloody handsome! Beg blogger for xiao ge ge contact info!\"...............With more and more comments, the more and more curious people who came in, and then...after they saw Yu Qing Huan's picture, they never came out again. Thus, the #Gao Yun Cheng National Male God# topic, was rapidly replaced by #Hua Da Uniform Wearing Xiao Shi Ge#Now in Weibo, there was already countless number of people crying and begging for Yu Qing Huan's contact info, leaving the blogger no choice but to post once more in Weibo.San San Niang De Shui Shou Fu: Inexplicably become one time Internet Celebrity, now my head still feels dizzy. Everyone calm down, I also don't have xiao shi ge(little senior) contact info. Don't need to even think about coming to our school because xiao shi ge has already graduate this year. Went to journalism department to find out but everyone also don't know xiao shi ge sign which company. I also hear that his family situation is not too good, so when studying also keep working part-time. Distress ah! QAQThat post immediately pushed the topic to a new peak.In a split second, the netizen's brain hole grew bigger and came up with an 'Poor genius who was struggling his hardest' story. One after another calling out in distressed. There were even a group of mother bloggers that directed the topic to their homepage and preparing to use it as an example to educate their child.Just like that Yu Qing Huan suddenly became famous. It was like sitting in a rocket and deeply shot into the netizen's heart, so fast that people couldn't believe it. He didn't even have a single sunspot.You say he making hype? He was a splendid graduate of Hua Da and until now his name wasn't reveal yet, still need to hype?!Saying the face was not handsome, the picture were P? Just dropped it ba, even pixelating the photo could still see the snow.[T/N: P : Photoshop]Such a positive young man trying hard to improve his life, is there any black secret to hide away.When Yu Xin saw the post in Weibo, it was to the extent that he thought he dreamt that he bought water army!\"What, what is going on?\" He held his phone in disbelieved and looked at Yu Qing Huan with his eyes wide opened, Yu Xin still felt dizzy.Not only they never spent a single penny to buy the hot search, they also managed to slap Gao Yun Cheng's face. There was actually such a good thing in this world?!\"It's fake ba.\" Yu Qing Huan scrolled his phone screen for a while. He quickly went through the posts in Weibo and was dumbstruck.Despite his experiences, he would never thought that the topic would went askew like that.\"Ahahahahaha, this is call wicked people will face karma! No zhuo no die!\" Yu Xin finally reacted and swept away his previous resentment. He held his phone tightly and fiercely kissed it twice. He side hugged Yu Qing Huan, his heart felt so happy until he almost fly away, \"Your luck is so absolute, it's my first time encountering this kind of thing.\"Yu Qing Huan difficultly squeezed out a smile, \"Yeah...\"What was wrong with his rebirth in this lifetime?! Why was everything he experienced so weird?! Obviously he wanted to keep a low profile, but it was like God was opposing him. To the point that he wanted to lay low but couldn't.While he was thinking, his right hand was suddenly caught by Yu Xin.Facing those pair of eyes shown with bright green light, Yu Qing Huan's heart trembled: \"What's wrong?\"Yu Xin looked at Yu Qing Huan with his eyes burning, \"Didn't you buy lottery ticket yesterday?\"Yu Qing Huan: \"Yes, yes ah.\"\"Take it out!\" Yu Xin was too excited that he spittle out his saliva. His gaze at Yu Qing Huan was like looking at a fortune cat.\"...Here.\" Yu Qing Huan groped out the two lottery ticket from the drawer. Before he could fully extended his hand and the ticket was already snatched away by Yu Xin.\"Quickly! Search for this week's result.\"Yu Qing Huan helplessly waved his hand, simply didn't take out his phone, \"Ge, don't blindly bustle around, impossible will hit...\"\"Oh fuck!\" Meanwhile, a world-shaking yell burst out all of a sudden from Yu Xin's side. \"Qing---Qing Huan!! You hit the---the Jackpot ah!!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Holding Yu Qing Huan with his trembling hands, Yu Xin said repeatedly, \"We won, we won, we won!\"\"How much?\" Yu Qing Huan felt a bit dizzy.After taking a few deep breaths,Yu Xin gave Yu Qing Huan a thumbs-up while putting the other hand against his chest, \"The first Prize!\"\"Really?\" Yu Qing Huan popped out his eyes, snapped the phone from Yu Xin and started to check the numbers on the lottery with the winning numbers one by one.From the first to the last, all numbers matched!Over 6 million yuan for a single lottery, and Yu Qing Huan bought ten of the same number!\"You must be kidding me.\"he mumbled suspiciously, threw himself on the couch. Staring at the two thin pieces of paper in his hand, he even could not utter a word.This is ridiculous!In his previous life, Yu Qin Huan opened an anonymous Weibo account especially for lucky draws. But due to his incredibly bad luck, he had never won for even once, even in those of 99% winning rate as they claimed!How come he became so god-favored and so lucky after reincarnation? This was insane!\"We're rich, we're rich now.\" Yu Xin walked around in the room, with his hands clenched tightly and eyes shining, like it was him who won the lotteries.After over 10 minutes walking around like this, he managed to calm down. His bloated body hopped before Yu Qing Huan at an incredible speed, \"Qing Huan, over 60 million! Over 60 million! How're you gonna spend it!?\"He simply went on before Yu Qing Huan could ever reply, \"Brand G's limited edition premium custom suit, leather shoes, watches, we'll buy them all! Ah, yes! Also, the necklaces and the collar clips, we'll hunt for the best!\"\"Come on! Let's make a shopping list!\"His eager look resembled a shopaholic girl who was crazily adding goods to her shopping cart on the discount day of Double Eleven!\"Dude, chill out, chill out.\" Yu Qing Huan exhaled a deep breath and then tried to calm down Yu Xin who was like sitting on a hot seat, saying, \"Don't forget we have to pay taxes, twenty percent. So actually we only have more than 40 million.\"He had seen too much money in his previous life. So, although over 40 million is a huge number, to Yu Qing Huan, it was really not that much. He just got amazed by his good luck and then went back to normal.Yu Xin, quite the contrary, looked at Yu Qing Huan enviously and yelled at the top of his lungs, \"What? Only? More than 40 million and you tell me it is only?\"It looked like if Yu Qing Huan said another word, Yu Xin would throw a fist into his face. So Yu Qing Huan chose to shut his mouth. Then he tried to change another topic, \"I wanna buy real estate.\"This finally eased Yu Xin down. He said, \"Good idea. We should buy real estate. But where do you wanna buy one? A villa in Purple Mountain? Or a river-view one in overseas Chinese area?This young man had the potential. He made his debut as the second male lead in Liu Jia An's film. As long as he didn't mess things up, he would have his place in the entertainment circle. At that time, it was inappropriate for him to live in the dormitory of the company.So, Yu Xin thought this prize came right in time. It was god-sent money for Yu Qing Huan to buy real estate.Yu Qing Huan shook his head, \"None of those places. It'll be OK as long as it has good security and environment.\"He weighted it for a few moments. The current house price was not too scary to make people turn pale. 20 million would be enough for a small one about 100 square meters in a fancy community, including the decoration fee.\"20 million for real estate, and for the rest, I'll donate it all.\"Yu Qing Huan's parents died in a car accident when he was just 12 years old. Nevertheless, he was far from tasting the rigors of life. His parents related to people quite well when they were alive, and their relatives and neighbors all knew that Yu Qing Huan was a good boy, so they lent their helping hands together to send him to the best university.Although Yu Qing Huan never mentioned this past, he always kept them in mind. The reason why he entered the entertainment circle soon after his graduation was because this was a good chance for fast money, so he could repay those who were kind to him early.\"You want to donate it?\" Yu Xin dropped his jaws. He couldn't believe his ears. He tried to persuade Yu Qing Huan, \"You are just a newbie in this industry and have no background. Now what you need is money. If you want, you can make donations after you earn your name.\"\"Sorry.\" Yu Qing Huan, however, insisted on his decision. \"Xin, I've already made up my mind. This is it. Well, can you do me a favor to go back to my hometown to talk to the local government on my behalf? \"Yu Qing Huan's hometown was called Peach Town, a place with picturesque sceneries.The town was rich in yellow peaches. Almost every family had a large peach garden. The peaches produced there were juicy and as sweet as honey. Due to the inconvenient transportation, these peaches could not be transported outside but only sold in the nearby towns at the price of 0.5 yuan a kilo, while the ones unable to be sold were rotten in the fields.In his previous life, Yu Qing Huan had struggled years after he could donate money to help his hometown to repair the road and open a cannery. In this life, he got good luck and a windfall without efforts. The good days of the villagers should come earlier, he thought.However, he was occupied now. All the actors in The Line of Life and Death took their place. He had to meet other actors these days, get familiar with the movie sets and take makeup photos. So he could only ask Yu Xin for help.He knew Yu Xin was a trustworthy man.Yu Xin gazed at the stubborn man for a long time, and then slowly exhaled a long breath, \"Well, I'll help you this time and make sure everything done properly. You can rest assured and focus on your acting here.\"Yu Xin thought to himself, \"If it were me, I would have never been like Yu Qing Huan to donate over half of the money when won the lottery while I was still poor.?\"Not everyone was so generous and righteous like Yu Qing Huan was!Yu Xin was sure that even if Yu Qing Huan hadn't entered the entertainment industry, he would succeed in other fields. His eyes fixed on Yu Qing Huan with sort of admiration. The next day, he began to use his connections to inquire about the government in Peach Town.Since Yu Qing Huan trusted him, he should nail it and never let him down.After Yu Xin left, Yu Qing Huan stayed at home and read the script of The Line of Life and Death. Even though he had read it for dozens of times, he did not dare to miss anything. Reading one more time, he thought he might have new inspirations.One day at noon when he was thinking about what to eat for lunch, his cell phone started to vibrate.He unlocked the phone and found out that the director Liu Jia An created a chat group called The Line of Life and Death and added all the actors in.Liu Jia An: [Everyone attention, please change your nicknames in the chat group to real names plus your roles in the film to make it easier for us to know each other. Ah, yes, this evening, the film crews would gather for a meal at Yi Pin private kitchen. Inform us in advance if you cannot come.Liu Jia An was a retired soldier. His working style was very tough and looked very dignified. Therefore, after he finished his words, no one dared post a reply. It seemed that everyone succumbed to the director's power and dared not to decline the dinner.Liu Jia An felt satisfied and his voice softened, \"Then we'll meet at six o'clock in Box 101 of Yi Pin.\"Yu Qing Huan changed to his real name in the chat group name. When he refreshed the page, he found most of the people had already done that.The actors in the cast were no different from those he had met in his previous life. The leading actor, Peng Cheng, was starred by Zhao Qin Yuan, Best Actor of Golden Flower Film Awards. And Le Chen, the leading actress, was played by Wang Cheng Cheng, the rising star of Starlight Entertainment.In his last life, Yu Qing Huan had never had any connections with these two people. And after rebirth, his life circle had been changed completely.Yu Qing Huan dressed up simply and went out of the door, ready to buy clothes for the dinner. This was the first get-together of the film crews, he could not be dressed in rags, in case he met someone he crushed on.Chance favors the prepared mind. The same as a man like him.Fortunately, he did lots of part-time jobs when he was in college, and still had some savings in bank, so he wouldn't go bankrupt for a suit of clothes.After eating some food, and back from registering the information in the lottery center, he went to the mall with ease.At the same time, the weekly family gathering of the Huos was also underway.Looking at her mute, impassive and poker-faced third son, Mrs. Huo sighed, \"My dear, any clothes you like? Mom will buy anything you like.\"Huo Qu gave Mrs. Huo a look and shook his head.Mrs. Huo had been used to his indifference and dragged him into a shop. \"Come on, go and try on these clothes. Your two brothers and I will be your advisors.\"The shop was a newly-opened one, and the new autumn series were arranged in rows after rows, which made people dazzling. Huo Qu had a bad feeling like sensitive little animals ever since he approached the shop. He stepped back and hesitated to say, \"But\u2026I need go to the research institute later\u2026\"\"You are free from that! Your older brother has asked for a leave for you.\" Mrs. Huo glared at him. She looked at the clerk arrogantly and said, \"Bring me all the blue, black, and purplish red suits of correct size of that row.\"Holding a large pile of clothes, she pushed the reluctant Huo Qu into the fitting room.Mrs. Huo and his sons waited outside, but Huo Qu never came out.Mrs. Huo didn't notice anything unusual. She pushed Huo Rong beside her and said calmly, Xiao'er (It literally means waiter in English), your brother probably is unable to put on the clothes himself. Go and have a look.\"\"Mom, can you stop calling me that? Sounds like I'm a waiter.\" Huo Rong stood up and protested.\"Shut up!\" Mrs. Huo glanced at him and said impatiently, \"Why are you still lingering? Go and see your brother.\"Huo Rong could only zip his mouth, and walked into the fitting room with humiliation.Sure enough, Huo Qu was fighting with the buttons on his pants. The shop did some tricks on the buttons, so Huo Qu fiddled with it for a long time and did not know how to fasten them. He looked at the delicate buttons blankly and was at a loss.\"Your pants.\"\"Ah, I got it\", Huo Qu finally understood.\"Brother, our mother is cruelly partial.\" Huo Rong held his brother's skirts and exclaimed, refusing to stand up.When Huo Qu was about to go out, Huo Rong held him, so he felt at loss a few seconds before he lowered his head and looked at Huo Rong confusingly, \"?\"\"Alas, I was treated like a dirt by our mother. I'm sad and helpless.\"Huo Qu blinked and thought for quite a while. Suddenly he raised his hand and stroked his second brother's head, \"Don't be sad.\"On hearing this, his silly brother was cured instantly, rushed out of the fitting room like a little husky and volunteered to be his brother's dressing server.Huo Qu was of great stature with a pair of long legs and he was born with a clothes-horse figure. He looked both handsome and abstinent in everything. Mrs. Huo was indecisive momentarily. She thought every suit was perfect, but she cannot afford to buy the whole shop, so she simply pulled her two sons to her side to talk about it.The three discussed heatedly. No one noticed that when Huo Qu saw the fleeting figure outside, his eyes suddenly lit up and he chased out without a second thought.When Mrs. Huo finally made the decision and wanted to pack the clothes for payment, she found out that her youngest son was missing!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So she urged Huo Rong, \u201cDid you call him? How is he? Where is Huo Qu now?\u201d\u201cMa, no one picked it up.\u201d Huo Rong could only hand over the phone to her and let her hear the busy tone, \u201cI guess he didn\u2019t bring his phone today.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so mad at him!\u201d Mrs. Huo gasped, putting her hands against her chest, with tears in her eyes.\u201cMa, don\u2019t you worry.\u201d Huo Zheng squatted down and tried to comfort her, \u201cHe is an adult. He can take care of himself. It\u2019s all right.\u201d In case she disapproved, he added, \u201cHow about this? I\u2019m gonna bring the bodyguards to look for him in the mall, while you and Rong go to the reception and ask them to broadcast it.\u201d\u201cOK, OK, OK.\u201d Mrs. Huo was already out of her mind, but could only grab his eldest son\u2019s hand and nodded.Having no idea that his family were all anxiously looking for him, now Huo Qu was standing before the tall and round ornamental in the middle of the mall, with all confusion written on his face.He was sure that he saw Qinghuan, but why was he gone in an eyewink?Touching the number plate in his pocket subconsciously, he looked a little anxious.His second brother said this was for audition. He had no what idea what it meant, but maybe it was quite important for Qinghuan. So he wanted to give it back.On thinking of that, Huo Qu paced up and kept looking. He had no idea why he had been spinning in the same place.Huo Qu, \u201c?\u201dHe had been in this place for the twelfth time already. So strange!\u201cMom, why is he going in circles there?\u201d A little girl wearing a pink sweater asked her mom while pointing at Huo Qu.The young mommy was a little surprised on hearing her daughter. And she happened to see that Huo Qu was starting the next round.\u201cHe\u2026he is playing games, I guess.\u201d The little girl\u2019s mom racked her brains and finally came up with a reason.The little girl\u2019s eyes immediately shone! She shook off her mom\u2019s hand, and stumbled all the way to Huo Qu, \u201cHello? What game are you playing? I wanna join you.\u201dHuo Qu lowered his head and said to her with a serious tone, \u201cI\u2019m not playing games.\u201dThe little girl immediately got her eyes filled with tears. She said, \u201cYou are lying. You are playing games!\u201dHuo Qu said with a stressing tone, \u201cI ain\u2019t lying! I said I ain\u2019t playing games!\u201dRight after he finished his words, the little girl burst out crying, \u201cYou\u2026you\u2019re a bad guy! You are a bad guy!\u201dHuo Qu stepped back, panicked, watching the little girl\u2019s mom running towards him. He opened his mouth a few times and finally squeezed a few words, \u201cShe\u2026she is crying\u2026\u201dThe little girl\u2019s mom forced a smile as a response and immediately lowered her head to coax her daughter.The little girl couldn\u2019t stop crying.Being stared by that pair of big and watery eyes, Huo Qu swallowed some savila out of nervousness. He held the ornament next to him and tried to sneak away, but accidentally stepped on the foot of someone behind him.\u201cAh! I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He apologized. And when he turned around and laid his eyes on the person from behind, he got a little surprised, \u201cQinghuan!\u201d\u201cHuo Qu?\u201d Yu Qinghuan still remembered him, after all his clean-cut face was really hard to\u201cThis is for you!\u201d Huo Qu didn\u2019t answer him, but fumbled in his pocket and handed something to Yu Qinghuan, like he was trying to claim some credit. He looked at him with his eyes shining, \u201cI\u2026I picked it up.\u201dYu Qinghuan had been curious how he knew his name. But when he looked at the number plate he immediately understood, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s mine. Thank you. But it\u2019s of no use now. Just throw it. You don\u2019t have to give it back actually.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026I see.\u201d Huo Qu slowly lowered his hand, looking much glumly.Like a pupil who had finished his homework and waited for his parents\u2019 praise got a wet blanket thrown on him on the contrary.His disappointing expression triggered Yu Qinghuan\u2019s curiosity, \u201cSo what are you doing here? Buying clothes?\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d Huo Qu nodded his head hard. He got distracted by Yu Qinghuan immediately.Yu Qinghuan knitted his brows, \u201cYou are alone?\u201dHis family was really careless to let such a mama\u2019s boy run about alone.\u201cNo!\u201d As for Yu Qinghuan, Huo Wu would love to answer any of his question, \u201cI came with my mom and my two brothers.\u201dYu Qinghuan heaved a sigh, \u201cWow, you got a big family.\u201dWhen Huo Wu was about to tell him none of them was biological, Yu Qinghuan lowered his head and looked at his watch, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s late.

You stay with your family.\u201d\u201cHe is leaving!\u201dHuo Qu felt quite disappointed on hearing that, and squeezed two words, \u201cAll right.\u201dYu Qinghuan smiled at him and then walked away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was lost in a trance for a few seconds before he opened his mouth, \"Oh, sorry. I didn't bring mine.\"Looking at that disappointing delicate face, his heart immediately softened, \"Give me your phone. I'll save my number for you.\"Huo Qu tried every pocket on him, and then raised his empty hands, \"Oh no! Qinghuan, I\u2026I didn't bring it with me.\" Tear sprang to his eyes.Yu Qinghuan sighed in his heart. This was killing him! If it hadn't been because he was not his type, he would have already got him laid.\"It's OK. I have your name card. I'm gonna call you tonight. Then you will know my number.\"\"That's good.\" Huo Qu finally turned tears into smiles, with a shallow dimple on his left face, \"Urgh\u2026don't forget to call me.\"Yu Qinghuan got a little embarrassed, \"Sure.\"He had a dinner party at night, so he couldn't stay long with Huo Qu. But since Huo Qu was so clingy to him, he couldn't bear to leave him like this. When he was about to ask him out for dinner next time, someone broadcasted, \"\"Mr. Huo Qu. Come to the reception if you hear this. Your families are waiting for you.\"It had been broadcasted five times, every time it got faster than last time.Like someone was urging you\u2026Yu Qinghuan turned to Huo Qu and asked surprisingly, \"So you lost contact with your family?\"Huo Qu, \"?\"\"Quit it.\" Looking at his ignorant face, Yu Qinghuan tried to change the topic, \"Do you know where the reception is?\"Huo Qu shook his head.\"Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.\" Yu Qinghuan touched his forehead and looked around. Then she saw a shopping guide wearing a uniform special to the shopping mall and immediately held her, \"Hey there, can you do me a favor to send him to the reception?\"Now was the maximum flow of the day. The shopping guide wished that she could have grown out eight legs. She raised her head, looking impatient, \"The reception desk is over there. Can't you\u2026\"The three words 'send him yourself\" got stuck in her throat when she saw Yu Qinghuan's face.\"Well\u2026I can show you.\" She immediately changed her tone.\"Not me.\" Yu Qinghuan pushed Huo Qu before her, \"It's him. Thank you.\"The shopping guide's heart skipped another beat. Watching Huo Qu's delicate face, his brain was going on a strike, she then nodded subconsciously, \"OK. Sure.\"It was really her day today! She met two super cute guys at one blow! Let alone lead the way, she would even be very pleased to buy them anything!On seeing this, Yu Qinghuan felt much relieved. He went out of the shopping mall after telling Huo Qu.Huo Qu stood there, watching Yu Qinghuan fade away. And then he looked back and went to the reception desk with the shopping guide disappointedly.\"Silly boy, where have you been?\" On seeing him, Mrs. Huo immediately trotted towards him and patted him lightly, mumbled, \"You made me worried!\"Huo Qu looked at her, confused, \"?\"\"You don't know the way home and have no idea how to call a taxi. What if you get lost? Huh?\"\"That won't be the case.\" Huo Qu said seriously.\"How dare you talk me back?\" Mrs. Huo asked Huo Rong to give Huo Zheng a call to tell him they had found him, and then turned to Huo Qu and kept lecturing him, \"Did you forget you have just got lost a few days ago? Huh? Why don't you listen to my words?\"While Mrs. Huo kept nagging beside, Huo Qu's thoughts had already flown away.He wouldn't get lost. Qinghuan would take him home.On thinking of Yu Qinghuan, Huo Qu felt like a bird was flying in his heart, happy and jaunty. He had no idea why he had that kind of feeling. Maybe out of gratitude. After all only Qinghuan saw through his embarrassment at that time.\"Mom!\" Huo Qu interrupted his mother's nagging, \"I wanna go home.\"Both Mrs. Huo and his two brothers got stunned.It was the very first time Huo Qu made a request from them for all these 27 years!Before he was like an invisible person who never expressed his own thoughts or had any hobby. What was more, he'd take any food they gave him, and never talked with others, which was also one of the reasons why Mrs. Huo was worried about him.But today he said he wanted to go home!Mrs. Huo nearly cried with joy. She left all the lecturing words behind and asked the driver to get the car in the parking lot.On the way home, she thought her little son would talk to her. But unexpectedly, Huo Qu stayed silent as the same as before, turning a deaf ear to them, only sitting there, well-behaved.The only difference was, after they got home, he immediately started to look for his phone.\"It's here.\" Huo Rong could not bear to see him scour the house like a headless chicken, so he took the phone from under the cushion and threw it to him.Huo Qu took the phone and went upstairs joyfully. Then he put it on the desk scrupulously and stared at the black screen, with only expectations written on his face.Qinghuan said he would call him.While all the others were left in the dining hall, looking at each other, with all question marks stuffed in their heads.\"What\u2026is wrong with Huo Qu?\"The author's OS: Huo Qu: I will wait beside the phone, so I can pick it up right after Qinghuan calls\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was exactly 5:30 when he arrived.Only the director team was there. None of the other actors had arrived.Liu Jia'an smiled on seeing him, and then asked him to sit. He then told Jiang Qi the whole story that day and then said some nice words about him, \"This kid is not bad. I can see something in him.\"Jiang Qi nodded. His distain about Yu Qinghuan reduced a lot. He then approved, \"Hm, this young man is very promising.\"For most actors nowadays, whether he/she was a big star or a C-list celebrity, they all tried to put on airs. He/she may already take himself/herself as a super star already after shooting a net play, with no acting skills but a bunch of defects.On the contrary, Yu Qinghuan had wonderful acting skills, but he was still trying to cover his shortages, and also always keeping a low profile. He had the potential.On thinking of that, Jiang Qi couldn't help but say, \"Qinghuan, don't belittle yourself. You have great acting skills. Seize it if there is any good opportunity.\"He knew this kid had nearly missed the role Ye Sheng since he was not confident about his acting skills.Yu Qinghuan felt a little flattered. It was not because he had no confidence of his acting skills. He just didn't want that role. Of course, he wouldn't tell anyone about this, but could only pretend to be listening to their teachings with all gratitude on his face.It was nearly six o'clock and all casts were almost arrived. Yu Qinghuan was wise enough to greet Liu Jia'an and then seated himself in a corner. He had just started his career, and was only the third male lead. If he sat too close to the director crew, rumors would immediately spread everywhere the next day. Besides, in this life, he had no desires for fame. He was quite satisfied with his present situation.Most of the casts met each other for the first time. But soon the already hit it off, and even exchanged their phone numbers. Since Zhao Qingyuan and Wang Chengcheng hadn't arrived, the second male lead Fang Zhongxi and the second female lead Li Hongxiu became the focus naturally.Both were online celebrities, and took up all front pages of the entertainment sites. So building good relations with them would only do them good.Yu Qinghua caught a glimpse of those people and sighed in his heart, and then refilled another cup of corn juice. With so many stars here, none was his type. So sad!Liu Jia'an caught a glimpse of Yu Qinghua and immediately pictured the scene \"As a newcomer, Qinghuan wants to get close to the seniors but hasn't got the guts\", which made him pity Yu Qinghuan more.This kid was way too honest. How would he survive in this grotesque entertainment circle? Forget it! Anyway he brought him into this circle and he was quite well-behaved. He had the responsibility to boom him.When he got up and was about to beckon Yu Qinghuan to come to his side, the door was pushed open suddenly. Wang Chengcheng's laughing was heard before she came in, \"Alas! So many people here. Am I late?\"Everyone there immediately stood up and said smilingly, \"No, we haven't started yet.\"\"Right. Miss Cheng, you are here right on time.\"Wang Chengcheng nodded, and then said with a smile, \"Then I won't feel guilty of myself.\" She scanned all the places and saw the nearest seat to Liu Jia'an was taken by Li Hongxiu. So she walked on by her and said softly, \"You're\u2026Hongxiu? The second female lead, right?\"Li Hongxiu got up instantly, feeling flattered, \"Yes, yes, it's me. Hi, Miss Cheng.\"Wang Chengcheng stretched out a hand, \"Wish we have a pleasant cooperation. \"Once her palm touched Li Hongxiu, she immediately took it back. She then blinked at her, \"I am a little late. So, could you switch your seat with me? I want to talk about the scripts with director Liu.\"Li Hongliu got dumbfounded and then immediately moved aside, \"You sit. You sit.\"\"Thank you then.\" Wang Chengcheng said thank you, and totally ignored those who were trying to hook up with her and started to talk to the director crew.It seemed Li Hongxiu was still drowning in the thrill of the scene that Wang Chengcheng talked to her first. She even bumped into a chair when walking, which aroused a blast of guffaw. Only Yu Qinghuan could see she had already clenched her hands tightly.What a wonderful drama!It seemed as if Liu Jia'an had already told the waiter. At 6:15, they started to serve the dishes. Yipin Private Home Cuisine was mainly Cantonese dishes, good quality but with a small amount, perfectly fitting the celebrities dining together.Right in front of Yu Qinghuan was Durian Snow Mei Niang, white and cherubic. One could tell it should be very delicious judging from its look. He looked around, finding that no one was even trying to grab a bite, so he appropriated it to himself aboveboard.Durian desert was always his favorite.\"Director Liu, why hasn't Zhao arrived?\" After digging some food for a while, Wang Chengcheng asked director Liu randomly.\"Zhao?\" When she mentioned Zhao Qingyuan, the smile on Liu Jia'an's face became much more sincere, which indicated they were on good terms, \"He is a little occupied today. He will be here later.\"\"I see.\" Wang Chengcheng rolled her eyes, with her finger rubbing on the glass in her hand, and then protested coquettishly, \"We're gonna punish him for being late later.\"Liu Jia'an chuckled, \"Sure, sure.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He even didn't notice someone sat next to him.That person had a large scarf on his face. It seemed he sneaked in without being noticed. Even if someone noticed him, one would only take him as a nonsignificant cameo role judging from the way he acted.Yu Qinghuan caught a glimpse of him while digging his food. At this time, that person had already taken off his big scarf, exposing a beautiful but effeminate face.Kind of familiar. Yu Qinghuan thought for a second but didn't recall his name. So he lowered his head and kept digging his food.Anyway he was not his type. So he didn't care who he was.Zhao Qingyuan thought this newcomer was different from others. Only he sat there chowing down, quite unlike others. Besides, he was sure he saw him right in his eyes, but he looked unperturbed at all.\"But shouldn't he stand up with reverence and awe and immediately come to say hi and ask whether I would like to eat some food?\" Zhao Qingyuan thought to himself.Zhao Qingyuan decided to show his posture as the best actor winner to teach this young man a lesson. But the next second, he saw that newcomer picked up a big piece of honeycomb tripes with his chopsticks and put it into his mouth. The way he ate was quite graceful and prissy, but somehow, it could arouse one's appetite.Zhao Qingyuan rubbed his belly and also felt a little hungry now. This newcomer was satan!\"Is it delicious?\" Being neglected for too long, he was even no better than a dish of honeycomb tripes, which made Zhao Qingyuan a little frustrated. So he could only move his ass and pick up a talk with Yu Qinghuan.\"Sure.\" answered Yu Qinghuan without even raising his head.Zhao Qingyuan, \"\u2026\"\"Why is this newbie such a maverick?\"Zhao Qingyuan thought, at this moment, only one sentence would exactly describe his present mood: Great! Young man, you've successfully attracted my attention.While he was still thinking, Yu Qinghuan pushed that plate of honeycomb tripes to his side, \"Eat.\"His tone was like he was talking to a cat or a dog that came for some food.Zhao Qingyuan, \"\u2026\"\"Never mind. I should fill my belly first.\"So another person joined the 'chowing down' team.Both Yu Qinghuan and Zhao Qingyuan were big eaters. Soon they had almost finished those dishes on their side. Meanwhile, the two of them became foodie friends without even knowing each other's name.\"Durian layer cake is also quite tasty.\" Yu Qinghuan said to Zhao Qingyuan, \"Really. Try it.\"Zhao Qingyuan immediately turned his head, with all disliking written on his face, \"I'm not into durian.\"\"Durian is good.\" Yu Qinghuan sighed and shook his head, \"That's your loss.\"Zhao Qingyuan snorted, \"I don't think so! I'm gonna have a taste! You're dead if it tastes bad!\"Speaking of which, he already squeezed a bite into his mouth with his eyes closed. He thought he would spit it out for its smelly smell, but it turned out to be pretty good.Yu Qinghuan noticed the subtle change on his face, he then raised his eyebrows, \"Not bad, huh?\"Zhao Qingyuan put on a weird look, \"Yeah\u2026kind of\u2026\" It seemed durian was not so smelly as he imagined. In fact it was pretty good.Although Yu Qinghuan was only in his twenties, he had seen a great deal of life. Even if he didn't mean to make friends with Zhao Qingyuan, he could still amuse him. While on the other hand, Zhao Qinghuan looked shrewd, actually he was the na\u00efve one. And they really hit it off. Finally they already acted as very close friends.Zhao Qingyuan took out his phone and asked to exchange their phone numbers and follow each other on weibo.After saving his phone number, Yu Qinghuan said awkwardly, \"I'm sorry. I don't have a weibo account.\"\"Huh?\" Zhao Qingyuan picked his ears and thought he misheard it. Was there any actor who didn't have a weibo account now? Even he had quite a few anonymous accounts. Noticing Yu Qinghuan was not like lying, he said, \"Then sign up for one. You may use it in the future.\"Actually Yu Qinghuan didn't want a weibo account at all. He liked being forgotten after he finished his own acting part. But Zhao kept pushing him, and he could not come up with a reasonable excuse, so he could only take out his phone.\"Hee hee. I will be your first followed one.\" Zhao Qingyuan held him on his shoulder, giggling, \"All right. I followed you. Come on! Follow me back!\"Yu Qinghuan nodded, and clicked the new follower message on the top right corner. When he saw the nickname and avatar, he got stunned, \"You are\u2026Zhao Qingyuan?\"\"You don't know me???\" Zhao Qingyuna popped out his eyes, staring at Yu Qinghuan like he was an alien, \"Seriously?\"Yu Qinghuan nodded and then followed him back, mumbling, \"Sorry I didn't recognize you.\"Now Zhao Qingyuan understood why he hadn't talked to him when he saw him. That was because he really didn't know him! He caught a glimpse at Yu Qinghuan, thinking, \"Is this man from Mars?\"He was the hitting star now. And besides, he was popular among all ages, from elementary school students to those housewives over fifty, everyone knew him. Now someone from the entertainment circle didn't know him, which triggered Zhao Qingyuan's curiosity. And he kept asking Yu Qinghuan this and that.As good-tempered as Yu Qinghuan was, his patience got worn out finally.Before he came, he had searched all leading roles' materials of The Line of Life and Death on the internet. If he recalled it correctly, Zhao Qingyuan's character setting was a cold-faced prince. But now\u2026his character setting totally collapsed\u2026Cold-faced prince? He was a total Huskie type!And while Yu Qinghuan was still complaining in his heart, he had no idea that Zhao Qinghuan followed a weibo account with only one follower and following only Zhao had been recommended on the top trending searches.Those who were familiar with Zhao Qingyuan knew that he was bland, plus his family was super rich. He entered into the entertainment circle only for fun. So unlike other celebrities, his weibo was only for personal use. And he only followed those he wanted to, and posted things as he wanted.But now he followed an anonymous account, with not even a single post!Who was this Yu Qinghua? Why would Zhao Qingyuan follow a dead account?This immediately exploded the whole weibo! And \"Looking for Yu Qinghuan\" topped the hot searches instantly.So, after the two photos crisis, with only a name, Yu Qinghuan again topped the hot searches some celebrities had been dreaming of\u2026The author has something to say: Qinghuan's OS: Who am I?

While people were at a hot buzz, Yu Qinghuan sat in a corner alone and got covered by a money tree, making him even more insignificant.It was director Liu that noticed that Zhao Qingyuan had come.After three rounds of wine, the usual seriousness on his face was totally gone. While drawing a big picture for those drunk casts, he suddenly heard someone snort in the corner unexpectedly.When he followed the sound, wondering who was so bold, he looked right into Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s provoking eyes.When did he come?Director Liu got startled and immediately moved his ass to him, \u201cWhy are you hiding in here? You should have said hi to us.\u201d\u201cWhy bother?\u201d Zhao Qingyuan waved his hand at him casually, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s too noisy there. I\u2019d better stay here.\u201d Liu Jia\u2019an had ever served as Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s grandfather\u2019s solider. They still had contacts after Liu Jia\u2019an got demobilized, so they always kept a good relationship.Although director Liu became a has-been now, throughout the whole entertainment circle, only Zhao Qingyuan would dare to talk to him with this tone.\u201cYou kid!\u201d Director Liu really wasn\u2019t angry with him. He derided him while catching a glance at Yu Qinghuan who was sitting next to him, \u201cYou know him?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan smiled and then clasped Yu Qinghuan\u2019s neck, \u201cThis is my buddy.\u201dWith the corner of his eye cramped, Yu Qinghuan brushed off his hand. Zhao Qingyuan didn\u2019t get angry. Instead, he sat even closer and tried to cuddle him again like sticking plaster.On seeing that, director Liu nodded smilingly, \u201cHm, Qinghuan is a good kid. You can not bully him.\u201dZhao Qingyuan rolled his eyes as the response.While they were chatting harmoniously, all the other people already dropped their jaws.When did Zhao Qingyuan come? Why had none of them even noticed?He was the best actor winner, and this was his movie party. Why would he hide himself? None of them had Monkey King\u2019s eyes. How could they recognize him?Those who had turned up their noses at Yu Qinghuan felt really sorry now.If they had known that Zhao Qingyuan was sitting in the corner, they would snatch a position there whatever the cost was!All the others felt remorseful and changed their attitude a180. They all bowed and scraped to propose a toast. But as cocky as Zhao Qingyuan was, he didn\u2019t buy it at all. He took none from them, including Wang Cheng.\u201cI don\u2019t drink.\u201d Leaning on the chair, Zhao Qingyuan caught a glimpse of Wang Chengcheng randomly.\u201cIt\u2019s my fault.\u201d With a fine-tuned smile on her face, Wang Chengcheng didn\u2019t feel embarrassed at all. She quickly put down the glass of wine and changed it to a glass of corn juice, then said to Zhao Qingyuan, \u201cMr. Zhao, how about I propose a toast with the corn juice?\u201dWang Chengcheng not only had a perfect outline, her bone structure was also perfect. With that fair-skinned and slim fingers holding the glass of bright yellow corn juice, what a feast to the eyes!Zhao Qinghuan just started at him. Only until Wang Chengcheng\u2019s hand got sour did he turned his head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I have had enough corn juice tonight.\u201dThis time Wang Chengcheng really felt humiliated. She made an excuse and went back to her own seat.Having been messed up by Zhao Qinghuan, the second half of the party seemed quite not right. It was supposed to end at 8. But now was only 7:30, and most people had already gone.Yu Qinghuan turned down Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s proposal of having another round of drink. And then he sneaked back home while the party was still on.Yu Qinghuan kept receiving messages from Zhao Qingyuan all the way home. Maybe Zhao hadn\u2019t had someone to talk to for a long time. Now he finally got one and kept nagging at him like he had just grown a mouth.Zhao Qingyuan: Qinghuan, you are new in this circle. There\u2019re so many things you don\u2019t know. Wang Chengcheng looks pretty though, actually she is the most scheming one among all of you! If I accepted her toast tonight, maybe the gossip between us would hit the headlines early next morning.Zhao Qingyuan: That Li Hongxiu is also a bitch. Oh man! See what kind of casts director Liu had chosen.Zhao Qingyuan: Qinghuan, let me tell you. Don\u2019t overthink things. Alas, I think I am the last pure land in this circle. As straightforward as I am, I wouldn\u2019t be welcomed anywhere. Never mind. I\u2019m better shut myself and try to improve my acting skills and maybe someday I\u2019m gonna win an Oscar.Yu Qinghuan scrolled all the messages expressionlessly. He didn\u2019t reply any, only threw his phone on the couch.He was not sure whether Zhao Qingyuan was the last pure land of the circle, but what he was sure was he was a total freak.Zhao Qingyuan had waited for a few minutes but still got no reply, so he kept bombing him with more messages.Zhao Qingyuan: Qinghuan, did you receive my messages?Zhao Qingyuan: Qinghuan, why don\u2019t you text me back? Pissed off? Having a bath? Or being asleep already?\u2026Yu Qinghuan got really annoyed by the nonstop messages, so he unlocked his phone and started to reply Zhao\u2019s messages\u2026Yu Qinghuan: Don\u2019t worry. You will always be popular wherever you go.Zhao Qingyuan replied in a split second: Wow! That\u2019s so kind of you! Trying to comfort me.Yu Qinghuan: But an Oscar? A definite no!Zhao Qingyuan:\u2026Zhao Qingyuan: Qinghuan, you really hurt my feeling, you know? I am the best actor winner!Yu Qinghuan: Oh. Gotta sleep. Nighty night!Zhao Qingyuan: \u2026If Yu Qinghuan said he was going to sleep, he really meant it. He had worked too hard in his precious life. Shooting the whole night wasn\u2019t a rare thing. The result was his body broke down before he was thirty. And finally he had a chance to reincarnate, and Yu Qinghuan decided he would take good care of this body.He would lie in bed at 10 on time every night. But tonight he couldn\u2019t fall asleep however hard he tried. He always thought something was on his mind.He racked his brain but still couldn\u2019t remember what he forgot.

But why hadn\u2019t he called yet?Did he drop his card or he simply couldn\u2019t remember where he put it?What should he do if that was the case?Huo Qu pressed the power button of his phone a few times, looking rarely anxious.Watching him from outside, his two brothers were scared. Huo Rong couldn\u2019t help asking Huo Zheng, \u201cZheng, what is wrong with him? He acted a little weird today.\u201dHuo Zheng frowned, \u201cIs he working on a new dangerous subject?\u201dIn order to study the life span of proton, Huo Qu had soaked himself in the pool for three whole days.

He whined, \u201cIt kills me if that happens one more time.Huo Zheng wanted to shush him in case Huo Qu heard them. But it was too late. Huo Qu suddenly got up and looked right in their direction, wearing no expression with that pair of empty eyes.Huo Rong tried to get on his feet, \u201cQu, I just want to check why you are still up.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Huo Qu held up his phone before Huo Rong, \u201cIs there any missed calls?\u201dMaybe Qinghuan had already called, but he was not good at using a phone, so he missed his calls.The more Huo Qu thought about it, the more reasonable he found it was. So he urged Huo Rong, \u201cRong, take a look for me.\u201d\u201cWhat missed calls?\u201d Huo Rong talked in whispers, but still started to check it carefully.There was nothing in his call records. No missed calls!\u201cNo one has called you.\u201d Huo Rong held up the phone and shook it in front of Huo Qu.Did he make some new friend? But that was impossible. For his personality, Huo Rong would rather believe that his little brother only wanted to know about the functions of his phone.\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Huo Qu\u2019s face instantly darkened. He went back to his room listless and squatted before his desk again like a mushroom.And then whatever Huo Zheng and Huo Rong asked, he always kept his mouth shut, like losing his tongue and his soul.Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t know when he fell asleep. In his dream, Huo Qu kept calling his name like a monk\u2019s enchanting: Qinghuan, Qinghuan, Qinghuan\u2026Yu Qinghuan then woke up with a start. Until then he remembered he promised Huo Qu he was gonna call him.As far as he knew about Qinghuan, he wouldn\u2019t sleep before he called. So he quickly turned on the light and routed out the card and dialed the number on it.Someone picked it up on the first ring. On the other end of the line came Huo Qu\u2019s lively voice, \u201cQinghuan!\u201d\u201cWow! You picked it up so fast!\u201d Yu Qinghuan was a little surprised, and then teased him, \u201cHave you been waiting by the phone?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Huo Qu replied without thinking, \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for your call the whole night.\u201dYu Qinghuan couldn\u2019t help but looked at his phone. It was already twelve o\u2019clock in the morning. How long had Huo Qu been waiting? He felt so sorry and immediately apologized, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Huo Qu. I forgot.\u201dHuo Qu wasn\u2019t angry at him at all, \u201cIt\u2019s OK. You kept your words anyway.\u201dHis words didn\u2019t make Yu Qinghuan feel any better, but made him feel more awful. Picturing how Huo Qu stared at his phone and waited for his call pitifully, he thought he was such a shithead.He could have forgotten anything but not this.\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. You go to sleep now. I\u2019m gonna treat you a big meal, OK?\u201d Yu Qinghuan decided to make up for him.\u201cDeal!\u201d Huo Qu had no idea what Yu Qinghuan meant, but he still agreed readily, as long as he could see Yu Qinghuan.Yu Qinghuan talked about something else and then hung up because he was too sleepy.Now he not only got Yu Qinghuan\u2019s number, but also got a chance to have dinner with him! The bad mood now was totally gone. Huo Qu then put away his phone, took a hot bath and went to bed, pleased.But the twin brothers outside who were watching all this would have a sleepless night.Huo Zheng, \u201cWho is Qinghuan?\u201dHuo Rong scratched his head, \u201cThe one I told you about last time.

Did you set them up?\u201dHuo Rong felt wronged, \u201cI am also wondering how they got to know each other.\u201d After a pause, he quietly closed Huo Qu\u2019s door and then said, \u201cHe is going to meet that C-list actor.

Cantonese cuisine, Sichuan cuisine, or Southeast Asian cuisine? I'm OK with all these. You can pick one you like.\"Huo Qu sat stiff there, with his black eyes looking ahead. No one knew what he was thinking. He had no response to Yu Qinghuan's words at all.So Yu Qinghuan couldn't help but poke his arm with his finger, \"Hey, I was talking to you.\"Huo Qu reacted like a startled rabbit. His stiff body trembled. With his thick eyelashes moved a bit, Huo Qu stammered, \"Qing\u2026Qinghuan\u2026\"\"Are you OK?\" Yu Qinghuan leaned closer to him and tried to look at the direction he was staring at but didn't find anything unusual. He then raised his head and looked at Huo Qu, \"Why do you look so nervous?\"It was in the midwinter. The weather was overcast and cold moist, while Yu Qinghuan was like a small sun around. Even his breaths were warm, which were blown gently on the side of Huo Qu's face, like a small downy hand itching his heart.Noticing Yu Qinghuan was staring at him, confused, he immediately got blushed, and stammered, \"I\u2026I'm not nervous.\"Oh lord! What was wrong with him? His heart started to beat fast. He felt like his whole body was burning hot even with a peep at Qinghuan. Had\u2026had he got the \"I-can't-look-at-Qinghuan\" disease?But Qinghuan was his best friend. How could he not look at him?Huo Qu pursed his lips anxiously and was nearly crying.\"Are you sick?\" Looking at his burning red face, Yu Qinghuan was afraid that he even had no idea he got sick. So he leaned forward and put his hand against Huo Qu's forehead. And he immediately got startled after feeling his temperature, \"You got a fever!\"\"Ah? Oh\u2026\" Huo Qu nodded muddleheaded, thinking, \"So it turned out I got sick. No wonder I would have those strange reactions.\"\"Let's take you to hospital.\" Speaking of which, Yu Qinghuan already clicked open the mobile map, trying to search the nearest hospital. At this time, Huo Qu pressed his hand.Once having intimate contacts with Yu Qinghuan, Huo Qu felt like his heart was beating in his throat, like a bouncy rabbit jumping in his chest, which made him nearly out of his breath. After taking a few deep breaths, he then plucked up some courage and said, \"But\u2026you said we're\u2026having dinner.\"Yu Qinghuan got dumbfounded, \"Are you hungry? I'm gonna buy you some food later. But we have to go to the hospital first.\"With his whole body burning like fire, he still hadn't forgotten about the dinner thing. Oh man! He was an absolute foodie!\"No!\" said Huo Qu anxiously. He firmly shook his head and insisted, \"Have dinner first.\"He had agreed to have dinner with Qinghuan. He couldn't stand him up.Yu Qinghuan, \"\u2026\"He tried to persuade Huo Qu out of it, \"You're sick now and has no appetite. You wouldn't eat much even if we have dinner now. So\u2026\"Before Yu Qinghuan said \"go to hospital first\", Huo Qu already cut in decidedly, \"I have the appetite. I can eat a lot.\"Yu Qinghuan, \"\u2026'Since he couldn't convince him, he could only say, \"OK, OK. You can eat a lot. Let's go eat now.\"On hearing what he said, Huo Qu finally felt happy, wearing a shy smile with the eyelashes fluttering slightly.Actually Yu Qinghuan liked Sichuan cuisine, spicy enough. But since Huo Qu fell ill, he dare not take him to have food with strong flavor. So he chose a marmite gruel restaurant.He ordered pigeon gruel and some specialties the waiter recommended. After thinking for sec, he ordered a portion of roasted razor clams.After ordering the dishes, he warned Huo Qu, looking quite serious, \"You can't have this dish, you heard me?\" A sick one could not have seafood. He meant to share weal and woe with Huo Qu, but at last he couldn't resist the temptation of the seafood and gave up\u2026\"I know.\" Although Huo Qu didn't know why, he firmly believed that any word Qinghuan said made sense.His too much obedience made Yu Qinghua a little guilty. Sometimes a kid who was too well behaved was also a kind of burden.It was workday today, so there weren't many guests here. And dishes were served quite fast. In his precious life, Yu Qinghuan liked the marmite gruel of this shop. Pity that he was way too popular, so every time he went out for dinner, he had to be extremely careful, even the restaurants were carefully selected. So even he wanted to, he never had a chance to come again.At that time, he had fame, money and status, but he couldn't even eat the marmite gruel he loved. So in this life, he would never live such a pathetic life.With a full spoon of fragrant gruel sent into the mouth, Yu Qinghuan felt quite satisfied with his eyes narrowed, enjoying it. Living a freewheeling life was the biggest present he got gifted after his rebirth.Pity that not long before he had tasted the flavor of freedom, he got interrupted by some kind strange sound. After he followed the sound and saw the scene, Yu Qinghuan got totally stoned.Huo Qu was trying to clamp the broiled eggplant. Pity his fingers were stiff. He was acting like a foreigner using chopsticks for the very first time. Forget about clamping it. He nearly poked it into a sifter. And the clashing of his ironwood chopsticks and the porcelain dish made kind of tinkling sound.Huo Qu's face was aflame with blushes. Qinghuan had no idea whether he was too sick or too anxious. Huo Qu pursed his lips, staring at the eggplant like it was the class enemy. Looked like he would never give up before putting it into his mouth.Yu Qinghuan, \"\u2026\"So how did this dude grow to this big safe and sound?He rolled his eyes secretly and then put a strip of the eggplant in Huo Qu's bowl, \"Eat.\"Watching Huo Qu eat the eggplant so seriously, Yu Qinghuan couldn't help but ask, \"How do you usually eat at home?\"It seemed Huo Qu didn't even know how to use chopsticks. So did his family hire someone who specially fed him?\"?\" Huo Qu raised his head, confused, with all questions marks in his black eyes, thinking,\"What does Qinghuan mean? I always eat this way.\"Yu Qinghuan rubbed his forehead and changed an easier way for Huo Qu to understand, \"I mean, suppose you are home having the eggplant, how are you gonna pick it?\"Huo Qu carefully thought about his question. But he really could not remember how he ate eggplant at home before. So he could only look at him like an innocent little puppy, \"I just eat it this way.'\"Forget it.\" Yu Qinghuan gave him another pair of chopsticks for the roasted duck, completely giving up talking with him on this, \"Eat.\"Only if they ate their fill could they go to the hospital.\"Hm!\"After receiving Yu Qinghuan dish-serving service again, Huo Qu smiled happily, and nodded his head hard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What was more, this guy, who had been poor since he was young, donated over half of the lottery money he won to his hometown.\u201cWatch your language, son!\u201d Right after Huo Rong said that, Mrs. Huo slapped his back of head. She was really pissed off every time she saw her two useless sons.She could give it a go that they opened an entertainment company. But they also learned those bad habits from the circle, dyed their hair, and became nocturnal animals like the owls.\u201cLook at Qinghuan, well disciplined, with great personalities.\u201d Mrs. Huo looked at Yu Qinghuan\u2019s photo and praised, \u201cI wish that I could have him as my son. How could you badmouth him like that? You\u2026\u201dMrs. Huo poked Huo Rong\u2019s forehead and said, \u201cWhat should I say about you?\u201dHuo Rong could not stand his mother's poking, and tried to dodge away.Hadn\u2019t she also started from a C-list star? Now on seeing Yu Qinghuan materials, she immediately changed her tone and even scolded them.They wouldn\u2019t mind if she thought they were no better that their little brother. But now they couldn\u2019t even compare with an outsider? What kind of mother was she?\"Are you still trying to quibble?\" Looking at her second son, Mrs. Huo raised her chin and asked with a sneer.Feeling like his father's sharp eyes suddenly fixed on his body, Huo Rong's body got stiff and he immediately surrendered, \u201cNo, no, no, every word you said is absolutely right.\u201dMrs. Huo goggled at them, \"why don't you drive home now? Not enough shame?\"Huo Rong: \"OK.\"Mrs. Huo then said, \"I told you that Qinghuan is an employee of your company, so you should take good care of him. If he hadn't sent Qu back that day, the consequences would be disastrous, you know?\"\"Yeah, I know,\" Huo Rong made a turn and watched his mom from the rearview mirror, and said, \u201cI promise I\u2019m gonna give the best resources to him, OK?\u201dMrs. Hall snorted.\" That's more like it.\"They left just in time, because Yu Qinghuan and Huo Qu just finished eating.\"According to the map, there is a market for flowers, birds, insects and fish nearby. I don't know if they sell fish in winter.\" Yu Qinghuan put away the phone and said to Huo Qu.Just now they were sitting in a small box. The boss was very good at decoration, putting a tank of colorful goldfish in the corner. Since he wouldn\u2019t move his eyes from it, Yu Qinghuan could only promise to buy him one.\"Yes,\" Huo Qu gave him a confirmative answer like he had gone there before.Yu Qinghuan crossed the road according the navigation. On the half away, he saw that Huo Qu was still standing there, as silly as a toad. He remembered that this kid didn\u2019t know how to cross the road. So he immediately went back to pull him, \u201cYou\u2019ve got me.\u201dHe still didn't understand why Huo Qu couldn't cross the road. Even if he couldn't himself, he had him now and he could just walk after him.\"Qinghuan, don't be afraid of me.\u201d On hearing Qinghuan was blaming him, he immediately got nervous and snatched a corner of Yu Qinghuan\u2019s clothes.He also knew that he was different from others, but he had never cared about others\u2019 judgments about him before. Now he heard Yu Qinghuan said that he was afraid, and suddenly his heart skipped a beat and a kind of indescribable pain rippled in his chest.Huo Qu vaguely touched his chest, he was really ill.\"...I'm not afraid.\" Yu Qinghuan twitched his mouth while touching his forehead with a hand. Seeing Huo Qu's suspicious eyes, he added,\" I'm not afraid of you at all.\"Afraid that Huo Qu might say something shocking, he pointed to the milk tea shop in front and said, \" I'll buy you a cup of hot drink. You stay here and don\u2019t you ever talk to anyone, you got it?\u201d\"Got it.\" Huo Qu put his hands along the creases of his trousers and nodded his head like a chicken pecking at rice.\"Don't go anywhere by yourself.\"\u201cOK.\u201dYu Qinghuan then felt a little relieved and went to buy him a hot drink.The moment Yu Qinghuan entered the milk tea shop, a group of people carrying cameras ran to Huo Qu.It is a new entertainment show launched by the national TV station. A fixed part of the show was interviewing passers-by. Huo Qu was handsome, tall, and bland, looking quite outstanding among the crowd. So they immediately nailed him.Although the national TV station had a detached status, most of its programs were too serious, so it was not in line with the taste of young people. The newly appointed director had great ambitions, so he directly decided to launch a variety show specially aiming at the young people.National TV production, of course it would make a hit, plus the great contrast between an entertainment show and the orthodox national TV station, of course it had attracted a lot of audience. Therefore, once this program was launched, it swept all over the country. Before Season I was finished, lots of people were already urging Season II on Weibo.The program crew stopped in front of Huo Qu, the hostess put the microphone before him,\" Hello handsome boy, we are the national TV program \"Young People Want High\", may I interview you?\u201dThe hostess looked beautiful and graceful, with a sweet voice also. Now she was wearing a sweet smile, which no one could not resist.While she was confidently waiting for Huo Qu's affirmative answer, he suddenly turned his face to the other side with a cold eye.Qinghuan told him he should not talk to strangers, so he listened to his words!The hostess: \u201c\u2026\u201dOther people of the crew, \u201c\u2026\u201dAre they so scary???

What could go wrong? Or was it because the man did not hear me\u201d thought she.She then coughed gently and asked again obstinately, \u201cHi, handsome. May I make an interview to you?\u201dAfter an awkward silence, the other party still responded to her with a cold and handsome side face.Now the hostess really felt embarrassed and could not help secretly felicitating that this was not a live broadcast, otherwise the whole nation could see her jokes.Disappointed, she withdrew the microphone and was about to signal the program group to leave when suddenly the male host jumped up behind her, grabbed the microphone excitedly, went around to the other side and said to Huo Qu, \u201cThis handsome, may I ask why you refused our interview?\u201dThe male host keenly sensed the blister in Huo Qu, so he rushed up with this intuition.However, Huo Qu just ignored him. He bit his lip lightly and then frowned and took a step back.The host, \u201c\u2026\u201dWas he a mute?The host was measuring him with his eyes when he suddenly saw that Huo Qu took a step forward and returned to the place where he had once standing.The host was overjoyed. He felt it was his own charm that released Huo Qu\u2019s mouth. So he rushed up excitedly. When he was about to speak, he saw Huo Qu turn his head aside again.The host, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe host was very hurt.Realizing the difficulty to touch Huo Qu, the host reluctantly gave up the interview, packed up his things and prepared to leave, thinking that when the program was broadcasted, he would show this segment as a post-credits scene.When he turned around, he accidentally found Yu Qinghuan come in a hurry with a hot cocoa. His eyes suddenly lit up.Did I buy lottery today? How could I meet a passer-by with such gorgeous face so easily? It seemed that God was blessing him today.The host was excited inwardly and raised his hands holding the microphone. However, he was pushed aside by a strong force before saying anything.When he finally found his balance, the host raised his head angrily in order to find out who the rude one was, but his eyes only caught the cold and reticent Huo Qu. At this time, Huo Qu was smiling at the person coming, \u201cQinghuan, you are back.\u201dEveryone in the program group were amazed to find that this person was not a mute!Then everyone was seized by flames of fury. Since he was not mute, why he made no reply even a refuse!Unaware of the anger from the program group, he accepted the hot cocoa from Yu Qinghuan in delight but encountered with some difficultly when he was ready to drink.He pinched a corner of the drink cover tightly with his thumb and forefinger\u2019s fingernails, and then tore it to the opposite direction with his utmost strength, but the cover stayed still. No matter how he exerted his strength, he could not tear off the plastic cover on the drink.In such a big winter, Huo Qu was tired out in a cold sweat.\u201cPoke it directly with a straw.\u201d Yu Qinghuan reminded him.Poke? Huo Qu held the straw blankly, failing to figure out what to do.Yu Qinghuan could not bear to see his clumsy appearance so he grabbed the hot cocoa and immediately inserted a straw into it and handed it to him, \u201cDrink slowly, it\u2019s hot.\u201d\u201cOk\u201d, Huo Qu nodded obediently, and just took a small sip of the drink as expected.People in the program group were stunned and surprised that there were people who did not know how to take a drink at the present age. What a freaking man!So it seemed, to some extent, reasonable for such a strange man not to talk to them just now\u2026After racing through these matters, Yu Qinghuan noticed the existence of the program group, \u201cYou are...\u201dThe program group was almost crying with joy. Finally, one of the two had respond! They interviewed so many people, but this was the very first time they had met people who took them as air.As soon as the cheeky host saw the opportunity, he immediately rushed up and said, \u201cWe are the program group of national television\u2019s \u201cYoung People Want High\u201d. We\u2019d like to interview you two, it that ok?\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c...\u201dHe just came out to have a meal and could meet with the interview from national television\u2019s variety show popular in his previous life! What kind of luck did he have in this life!He did not want to show his appearance in the variety show of national television, even as a passer-by, so he pushed Huo Qu beside him to the front and said, \u201cInterview him.\u201dHuo Qu, who was seriously drinking his hot cocoa, was suddenly pushed forward by Yu Qinghuan, with a puzzled face.\u201cDon't look at me, look at the camera and answer their questions seriously.\u201d Yu Qing Huan patted Huo Qu on his shoulder and said.Qinghuan asked him to answer the question seriously! Huo Qu put down the hot cocoa and looked at the host, posing as a serious listener.The host was delighted and hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat is your current job, please?\u201d\u201cProfessor of Institute of Advanced Studies of Hua Univ..\u201dThe host was struck dumb by this unexpected answer. Professor? Advanced Research Institute? How could it be! In his impression, professors were generally over 50 or 60 years old, but this handsome guy looked under 30 apparently!He rolled his eyes and did not puncture Huo Qu\u2019s lie. Instead, he asked, \u201cWhat is your research content?\u201d He could not wait to see Huo Qu\u2019s inability to answer his bewilderment in front of the camera.Gee\u2026I\u2019d like to see how you lose face in front of the whole country...Huo Qu said without any pause: \u201cHow subatomic particles gain mass mechanism.\u201dThe host, \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat? He could understand every single word but was perplexed hearing the whole sentence?\u201cWell, it is truly not easy for someone to be pretentious like this.\u201d thought the male host.So the host immediately changed the subject, \u201cDo you have any troubles in your current work and life?\u201dAfter hearing the question, Huo Qu swallowed some saliva and threw his eye on Yu Qinghuan cautiously.He knew it was wrong to lie, but he was worried that Qinghuan would be angry if he heard that\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Aware of his sight, Yu Qinghuan smiled playfully and winked at him cunningly. \u201cCome on, is it some kind of hidden secret?\u201dHuo Qu didn't grasp the intention behind his words, but he did follow the previous sentence. Since Qinghuan asked him to answer, he should have no scruples but tell the truth.\u201cI want two goldfish, but Qinghuan only promised to buy me one.\u201dYu Qinghuan and the host, \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat the fucking kind of trouble was this?!Yu Qinghuan held his forehead, \u201cForget about this. I\u2019ll buy as many as you want.\u201dHuo Qu\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cWell, change your answer\u201d, said Yu Qinghuan.\u201cThen there will be no more.\u201dThe host, \u201c\u2026\u201dCould you two please take a look at me?

That\u2019s not the point! The point is Qinghuan has to apologize to him!\"Anyway, you are the initiator of all this!\u201d\"All right. In what way you want to me to apologize? Treat you to dinner?\u201d For Zhao Qingyuan whose IQ only equaled to a five years old kid, Yu Qinghuan surrendered.\"There\u2019s a long line of people wanting to treat me to dinner.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan snorted. He rolled his eyes and immediately came up with a plan, \u201cYou have to cook for me yourself.\u201dAs a standard affluent second generation, as far as Zhao Qingyuan could recall, few people in this world knew how to cook. So he thought this would be a super challenge for Yu Qinghuan.\"No problem.\u201d Yu Qinghuan agreed without any hesitation, which stunned Zhao Qingyuan, \u201cLet me tell you. You can\u2019t buy any from outside. No helping hand. All by yourself!\u201d\"I know.\u201d Yu Qinghuan turned on the warmer. He then asked while warming his hands, \u201cWhat would you like to eat? What about baked ribs?\u201d One of Yu Qinghuan\u2019s biggest hobbies was cooking.Maybe because his parents had died young. Although those folks had given their greatest care to him, he still lacked the sense of security. Only by stuffing the empty fridge with a kinds of ingredients and make delicacies with them could fill the hole in his heart and make him have a sense of security.He had great gift in cooking. Pity that he had made few friends in his precious life, plus he had to keep fit, so his superb cooking skills had been totally wasted.Honestly speaking, he felt a little happy about Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s demand. After all, finally someone could enjoy the dishes he personally made. That was a joyful thing.\"That\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s great!\u201d Zhao Qingyuan swallowed some saliva. He had been on diet for the movie The Line of Life and Death. He was already drooling on hearing the words baked ribes, let alone the taste of it.\"Then I\u2019ll see you at the filming site.\u201d After saying that, Yu Qinghuan was about to hang up, but Zhao Qingyuan stopped him, \u201cWait! When are you arriving? I can pick you up at the entrance.\u201dPick him up? He is picking up the bakes ribs. But Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t puncture his lie, \u201cAbout 8.\u201d\"OK. See you tomorrow.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So he didn\u2019t have to buy the ingredients. This was the first time he would cook after his reincarnation, so he felt extra excited.Cut the quality ribs into pieces of the same size, pickled with the seasoning, then put them into the oven to bake, then make barbecue sauce with honey, lemon juice, soy sauce and cooking wine, when the ribs start to spit in the oven, brush sauce on the surface, turn them over and keep baking.In his small but neat kitchen, the warm light radiated from the oven reflected on Yu Qinghuan\u2019s delicate face, making a harmonious scene.The moment he opened the oven, the fragrance special to the barbecue immediately filled the whole kitchen. The ribs were baked just right, plump and juicy, ruddy and tempting. Only by watching it would already make one drooling.The only imperfect thing was he had made too much.But there should be a lot of people there. Zhao Qingyuan could share with others. So seen from this point, this amount was OK.Yu Qinghuan got a MKM and put the ribs in it in apple-pie order and took it to the filming site early the next morning.Yu Xin was still in Peach Village. He may not have come to an arrangement with those people. So Yu Qinghuan had to go to the filming site alone. Compared with other casts accompanied by a bunch of retinues, he was like a pauper who broke into brownstone district accidentally. What a scene!Zhao Qingyuan, who had been waiting at entrance early in the morning, saw Yu Qinghuan the moment he appeared. He didn\u2019t know why. He meant to ask about the bakes ribs in the first place. But when the words came out of his mouth, it turned into, \u201cWhy do you come alone? Where is your agent? This is your first play anyway. Why no one sent you?\u201dIs it possible he got excluded in the company?On thinking of that, Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s expression immediately became unfriendly.Having seen through what he was thinking, Yu Qinghuan felt a stream of warmth in his heart. After handing the MKM to him, they walked inside together, \u201cMy agent has gone somewhere else to do something for me.\u201d\"I knew it. You wouldn\u2019t be that pathetic.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan smiled while putting his hand on Yu Qinghuan\u2019s shoulder, then paced up, \u201cCome on. Hurry up. I told them to bring me a microwave.\u201dYu Qinghuan pursed his lips. He even bought a microwave for a meal of bakes ribs? That was the way how rich people acted.Now was the coldest time of the year. Though the ribs in the lunch box were not frozen, Yu Qinghuan took too many of them, he was afraid they might not be fully heated, so he set it to eight minutes. But Zhao Qingyuan was a short fuse. When it was only five minutes, he couldn\u2019t wait any longer and opened the microwave and took out the ribs.A thick fragrance was immediately smelled, making Zhao Qingyuan drooling. He put one into his mouth with two of his fingers.The delicious taste special to barbecue exploded on his tongue, and then spread to the whole mouth. His mouth got burnt, but Zhao Qinghuan still wouldn\u2019t spit it out. Before he finished the first one, he already stretched out his hand for the second one, meanwhile he gave Yu Qinghuan a thumbs-up with the other hand, \u201cHiss\u2026It\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s goddamn yummy!\u201d\"What smells so good?\u201d A rough voice was heard from behind suddenly. Liu Jia\u2019an followed the scent and came to them. On seeing the lunch box in Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s hand, his eyes shone, \u201cWhere do you get the ribs? Come on. Give me some!\u201dTheir shooting site was in a desolate area. One could barely see a bird nearby, let alone a restaurant! Liu Jia\u2019an had lost a lot of weight recently. Now on seeing meat, his image? Already gone with the meat! He sprinted to Zhao Qingyuan and snatched the lunch box from him.Zhao Qingyuan nearly cried with tears in his eyes, \u201cQinghuan made them for me!\u201d\"Don\u2019t be so stingy. You can ask him to cook for you next time.\u201d With a dodge, Liu Jia\u2019an escaped away from Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s hand, and immediately stuffed two ribs into his mouth at the same time.\u201cEnough! Enough!\u201d Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s heart was bleeding. When he was about to grab it back, a crowd of people ran here like the wolves seeing a small animal.\"What are you eating, Liu? Come on. Give me some!\u201d\"Ribs! Ribs! Come on. You can\u2019t havethem to yourself!\u201d\"Smells so good! I smelt it already there! Come on. Give me one.\u201d\u2026The counselor, scriptwriter, the producer\u2026all surged forward like a bunch of ravenous wolves. When Zhao Qingyuan came to his sense, the lunch box was already emptied.Looking at the empty lunch box, Zhao Qingyuan scanned around those people who grabbed the food from him with his resentful eyes. Now those people realized that they had snatched food from the best actor winner.They immediately ran away, leaving Zhao Qingyuan alone looking at the empty lunch box .Looking at his puppy eyes, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s heart immediately softened. When he was about to move to him and tell him that he could cook for him next time, someone grasped his hand from behind. He turned around and saw a whisker old man was staring at him like a wolf staring at a small animal, \u201cAre you Yu Qinghuan? You make two meals for me and I will write a exclusive script with you as the male lead, what do you say?\u201dThat was the legendary scriptwriter Zeng Peirong, who was hard boned, the most quirky, and never wrote scripts for celebrities no matter how much they paid him.Yu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dOnly two meals in exchange for a script Zeng Peirong personally wrote for him as the male lead? This must be a dream!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His brain got completely blank. He didn\u2019t come up with a better idea, so he could only excuse himself from Zeng Peirong\u2019s offer.Seriously? Zeng Peirong had been in this circle for forty years. There hadn\u2019t a single script he wrote wasn\u2019t popular. But since he already had the plan to distance himself from this circle, a popular script didn\u2019t belong to him.Zeng Peirong had never expected that he got turned down the first time he offered to write a script for someone. How is that possible?The number one scriptwriter Zeng Peirong, who had written numerous popular scripts and even got chased after by an artistic woman who wanted to have a baby with him at the age of sixty would get rejected by a newcomer in this circle!There must be something wrong!He pulled his thick beard a bit hard, then rolled his eyes, thinking, \u201cIs it possible\u2026this son doesn\u2019t know who I am?\u201dOn thinking of this, he suddenly took a tumble. Like he said, no one in this circle would reject his offer. This kid was new in this circle. He may even have met few unknown casts. How could he know him the big star?\u201cEh-hem! Eh-hem!\u201d Zeng Peirong straightened up, raised his chin and turned to Yu Qinghuan, \u201cSon, do you know who I am?\u201d\u201cWho gave him the courage to reject me? I will definitely make this son fucking regret today. Later he will get on his knees and beg me to write a script for him! And then I will turn him down right in his face! I can already imagine the dramatic changes of his expressions now!\u201d thought Zeng Peirong.He was worthy to be called number one script writer! In only a few seconds, he had already wrote a counterattack and face slapping drama over a few million words in his brain. When he was about to cook the following plot, a bland but nice voice was heard by his ears, \u201cSure, you are Mr. Zeng.\u201d\u201cI am\u2026What? You know me?\u201d Zeng Peirong got stunned, and the teasing words he had already organized well got stuck in his throat, with his wrinkly face blushed because of shame. Only after thumping his chest and stamping on his feet for quite a while did he regain his breath.The old man nearly flew into a rage. He pinned his eyes on Yu Qinghuan, \u201cThen why don\u2019t you let me write a script for you?\u201d He then squinted and asked, \u201cDo you have a problem with me, or you just look down on me?\u201d\u201cNeither.\u201d Yu Qinghuan knew that this old man liked being sucked up. So he said flatly, \u201cI am a newbie in this circle. I know I\u2019m not good enough for your script.\u201d After a pause, noticing Zeng Peirong\u2019s suspicious expression, he then added, \u201cAnd it\u2019s just two meals. You don\u2019t have to spend your valuable time to specially write a script for me.\u201dAfraid that Zeng Peirong may keep pushing him, Yu Qinghuan immediately lowered his head and put on a bashful expression, completely playing a newcomer in this circle lively.On seeing this, Zeng Peirong already forgot why he got mad, and his eyes became much gentler.No wonder he doesn\u2019t want me to write script for him. So he is a huge fan of me!He is afraid that his inadequate acting skills may ruin my script. So he resists the huge temptation, taking the risk of offending me to reject such a huge, maybe once-a-lifetime opportunity.He is neither conceited nor rash and has good personality. The most important thing is he hangs on the bottom line as an actor. This young man has the potential!\u201cGreat! Great! Good kids like you are just we lack of in this circle!\u201d Zeng Peirong sighed with emotion. He then moved forward, patted on Yu Qinghuan\u2019s shoulder and encouraged him, \u201cLearn from director Liu with your heart. Trust me. The script of your next film is all on me!\u201dZeng Peirong might have been kidding with Yu Qinghuan when he said those words at first. But for now, he was really thinking whether he had any script at hands suitable for Yu Qinghuan.Yu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dDidn\u2019t he make himself clear? He was really not interested.Yu Qinghuan decided to explain to him again.\u201cMr. Zeng, don\u2019t make an exception for me. To tell you the truth, my acting skills suck. I still need a few years to improve.\u201dYu Qinghuan now had no choice but to underbrag himself.But the more he explained, the more gratified Zeng Peirong felt.There was no such actor who had such clear self-knowledge in this circle! On hearing it was his script, whether it was suitable or not, no one wouldn\u2019t use all his/her connections for a role in it.But Yu Qinghuan rejected his offer again and again on the contrary!What noble personality he had!\u201cYou kid!\u201d Zeng Peirong pretended to get mad and gave him a filthy look, \u201cI know you adore me and is afraid you may ruin my script. But you can\u2019t let such a great opportunity slip away.\u201dIt was nothing his acting skills were not good enough. A good script, a good director plus good post production, they could make rotten wood grow into a towering tree!Seeing Yu Qinghuan\u2019s forehead oozing, he thought that was because Yu felt overwhelmed, so he stroke his beard approvingly, \u201cThen it\u2019s settled. Contact me when you finish your acting part here.\u201dSpeaking of which, he walked away, leaving Yu Qinghuan with all question marks in his head.Yu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dYu Qinghuan pulled his hair sullenly! This was the first time he couldn\u2019t stay poised. It was an accident that he got a role in The Line of Life and Death, and he could still take things under control. But if he accepted Zeng Peirong\u2019s invitation, what about his relationship?Maybe at that time, he would hit the headlines the next day even if he just held hands with his boyfriend!He already felt desperate even on thinking of that kind of days.\u201cQinghuan, what are you doing there? Time for the makeup! The director is waiting for you!\u201d Before he thought of more, Zhao Qingyuan ran to him and pulled him to his exclusive dressing room.Part of the bland image of Zhao Qingyuan was shaped to show to the public, but actually he was really bland to other peers, including the big star Wang Cheng.But now this actor called Yu Qinghuan could play so well with Zhao Qingyuan!? Those dressers looked at each other, only finding astonishment in each other\u2019s eyes. Then they immediately adjusted their facial expressions and laid low to invite Yu Qinghuan to sit before the dresser.Yu Qinghuan had a pretty face, and only in his early twenties, with porcelain skin, so the dresser only brushed a thin layer of foundation make-up on his face, adjusted his hair do, and then asked him to change into the white gown already prepared for him.\u201cAre you done?\u201d Liu Jia\u2019an was a little impatient now.Even though he saw something in Yu Qinghuan, as the third male lead, it was really not worth it to spend so much time on him. Besides, Yu Qinghuan was a newcomer, it\u2019d take more time to shoot the first picture from The Line of Life and Death for him. He had reserved two hours for him and now it was almost time.When he snuffed out the butt and was about to ask the assistant director Jiang Qi to see what was going on in there, the door of the dressing room got pushed open and Yu Qinghuan strode out wearing that white gown.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A breeze blew over that pair of long and straight legs. He could do the frame-in without doing any pose intentionally.\u201cGreat! Awesome!\u201d praised Liu Jia\u2019an, showing how satisfied he was about Yu Qinghuan. He even pulled Qinghuan to him and gave him some advice on his acting for the very first time, \u201cYou have seen the scripts, haven\u2019t you? Ye Sheng is a rebellious and indulgent man in early stage. So you have to show that kind of feeling when you shoot later.\u201dYu Qinghuan owned that kind of bland temperament. Although Liu Jia\u2019an had already seen the way he acted, he was still worried Qinghuan may not be able to show the feeling of Ye Sheng he wanted.\u201cI know, director Liu.\u201d Yu Qinghuan nodded and walked to the shooting site under the photographer\u2019s guidance.He had been an indifferent and prissy person in real life. But once before the camera, he immediately changed to another person.With his shoulder a little lowered, he leaned against the snow white wall lazily, chin raised slightly, lips curled up, with a hand in the pocket, and smiled gently at the photographer, \u201cIs it OK?\u201dAll the people there gasped. He asked whether it was OK? It was far more than OK!Such a simple pose looked so hot on him, like the hormones in his body were totally stimulated instantly, making everyone on site blush, but no one would like to move the eyes off him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s the goddamn right feeling!\u201d The photographer was crazily clicking with the trembling hands, and asked Yu Qinghuan to change his poses now and then.Yu Qinghuan did a perfect job, making Liu Jian\u2019an have nothing to do now.After a group of photos were done, the photographer immediately ran before Liu Jia\u2019an to show off, \u201cSee? Not bad, huh?\u201dIn the photo, Yu Qinghuan stood there, handsome and noble, like a little radiating sun, attracting everyone\u2019s attention. No wonder the photographer was so cocky. Those photos could even join an exhibition.To everyone\u2019s surprise, Liu Jia\u2019an frowned. He stared at those photos and felt something was not right.The photographer didn\u2019t expect he was still not satisfied. When he was about to say something, Liu Jia\u2019an said by his ear, \u201cAsk Yu Qinghuan to change his shirt to the light cyan one and shoot again.\u201dThey had prepared a light cyan shirt for Yu Qinghuan, but his temperament was a little bland. Liu Jia\u2019an was afraid he may not go with it, so he asked them to change a blue one.But after that group of photos came out, Liu Jia\u2019an saw Yu Qinghuan\u2019s acting skills and wanted him to challenge the light cyan one.They built the shooting site of The Line of Life and Death all by themselves, like the hospital where Yu Qinghuan had just shot the first picture of the film just now, it only had an aisle and an office, nothing else, even no ceiling.The extreme cold wind was blowing in, like the air people exhaled was with ice.To shoot the best photos, Yu Qinghuan only wore a shirt and the white gown, shivering. Once the shooting was over, Zhao Qingyuan immediately pulled him by the warmer. Now he already began to sneeze.Shooting one more time, he may catch a cold.But Liu Jia\u2019an was a perfectionist. If he wanted to something, he would do the best. He insisted that he shoot one more time. Jiang Qi was afraid Yu Qinghuan may be disgruntled, so he went to talk to him in person.He didn\u2019t expect that Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t show a slice of anger. He immediately took off the down jacket and ran to the dressing room to get changed.All the older generation in the crew appreciated his professional ethics.\u201cThis kid is good.\u201d\u201cYeah, Jiang, don\u2019t you have an induction cooker? Make some ginger soup for him. Qinghuan has no assistant.\u201d\u201cI have a Canada Goose. I\u2019ll go get it now. So he can put it on once the shooting is over.\u201d\u2026While the those serniors were busy for Yu Qinghuan, Liu Jia\u2019an\u2019s assistant suddenly ran over anxiously. He stopped in front of him panting, holding the phone, \u201cBad new! The investors just called, saying we have to change the third male lead to Gao Yuncheng from Starlight, they are putting additional investment as the condition!\u201dHe made a pause, observing Liu Jia\u2019an expression, and then said gingerly, \u201cWell\u2026.actually Gao Yuncheng is already here.\u201d\"Bullshit!\" Liu Jia\u2019an cussed, \u201cI chose Qinghuan! Who dare to change him? Starlight, huh? I\u2019ll call Huorong later!\u201d\"Challenge me! With us here, no one can replace Qinghuan!\u201d Those seniors were also pissed off.\"That's right! Call Huo Rong in my name!\"\"Or I can go to the Huo family to talk about it!\"These people were all old friends of Liu Jia\u2019an. He had put a lot of effort to have invited those big shots in their own domain to teach the actors. Even Huo Rong wouldn\u2019t dare say no to them.If it had been someone else, they might have agreed.But Yu Qinghuan just left a good impression in front of these people, showed them his acting skills and his efforts. The older generation like such a talented and good-tempered child. And the investors had picked the wrong person.The atmosphere of this circle had been misled by those so-called investors!They wouldn\u2019t believe, as seniors in this circle, they couldn\u2019t even protect a newcomer?So, when Gao Yuncheng arrived at the shooting site, here was the scene he saw:A row of gray-haired old men were sitting on little benches in the doorway, staring at him angrily with their ice cold eyes, as if they were going to tear him apart.Gao Yuncheng felt a shiver down his spine and stopped subconsciously.What......what is going on???

Owning a title of professor, he also enjoyed the special allowance of the State Council. His age and qualifications had earned himself a nickname of \u201cnational treasure\u201d in the entertainment circle. If it were not for his friendship with Liu Jia\u2019an, he would never have appeared on the scene.Jiang Qi did not dare to neglect the old man\u2019s request, \u201cYes, just a moment,\u201d replied him respectfully.When Yu Qinghuan arrived, he had already changed his clothes. Thinking that Wang Zhensheng had called him to have something urgent, he quickly went over without putting on his white coat. He was then wearing only a nattierblue shirt hastily tucked in his trousers, with a pair of scissors in his hand used to cut the labels.His tall and fit figure made this messy appearance looked not sloppy but free and easy, which well satisfied Wang Zhensheng\u2019s eyes.Such a young man was his ideal candidate for Ye Sheng. Well, Gao Yuncheng was quite the opposite.Wang Zhensheng grunted coldly with his eyes and brows filled with disdain for Gao Yuncheng, the man he thought inferior to Yu Qinghuan. So he was intent to pull Qinghuan over and let that starlet have a sense of inferiority!\u201cGood, good. Liu indeed has a good taste,\u201d said Wang Zhensheng with a kind face, having completely regarded Yu Qinghuan as his own child. \u201cYou look much better on this suit of clothes.\u201d He said, and patted Yu Qinghuan on the shoulder encouragingly. \u201cYu, play the role with your heart. You hear me?\u201d\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d Yu Qinghuan did not expect Wang Zhensheng to call him in such a hurry, just to say such this. Although feeling a little strange, he nodded obediently.Seeing the child so obedient, Wang Zhensheng kind of liked him more. Yu Qinghuan deserved his favor, thought he.People of Wang Zhensheng\u2019s status would generally not degrade himself to dispute with such an unknown little star as Gao Yuncheng. Therefore, he only hinted that Gao YUncheng should refrain from the idea of robbing the role of Yu Qinghuan and doing something underhand.While an ordinary actor receiving a warning from such an industrial authority would definitely make an apology and guarantee to behave himself. However, it happened that Gao Yuncheng had no idea who Wang Zhensheng was!He was a newbie in the entertainment circle, and his agent was absent today. Although Wang Zhensheng was a national first-class actor, he had long retired behind the scenes, so Gao Yuncheng had no idea who he was at all.A half-buried old thing inexplicably showed up to defend Yu Qinghuan and humiliate him? How could he bear it?Gao Yuncheng snorted, swept Wang Zhensheng with playful eyes, and finally focused on Yu Qinghuan. \u201cYour name is Yu\u2026Yu\u2026\u201d He rubbed his forehead in distress, \u201cYu what? Sorry, I don\u2019t usually remember the name of unimportant people.\u201d\u201cOh, doesn't matter.\u201d Yu Qinghuan\u2019s face remained unchanged, taking the other party\u2019s defiance as barking, \u201cWhether you remember me or not is not important to me, either.\u201d He ignored Gao Yuncheng\u2019s livid face and continued to say, \u201cSo what else do you want?\u201dGao Yun Cheng was furious with anger, but he knew that he was unable to outspeak the other side, so he could only restrain his anger and said maliciously, \u201cDon\u2019t you know the role is already mine? Pack up your bags and get your ass out of here!\u201dAfter finishing these words, Gao Yuncheng immediately felt that the air around him became fresh.The director took a fancy to him and he had a speech craft. But so what? All these tactics were mere paper tigers in front of the absolute power! He had backing behind him, while Yu Qinghuan was just a poor guy. I was on purpose to throw my weight on him, thought Gao Yuncheng.What could he do?! How dare he to fight back?!Looking at Gao Yuncheng\u2019s rampant face, the originally calm Yu Qinghuan got irritated, not to mention Wang Zhensheng beside. Although Yu Qinghuan did not want this role, he could not stand someone robbing it from him.However, before Yu Qinghuan could fight back, Liu Jia\u2019an had rushed over, \u201cGao Yuncheng, right? We\u2019d like to inform you that the role of Ye Sheng has been decided to be played by Qinghuan, and we have no plans to change.\u201dLiu Jia\u2019an, who just got off the phone with Huo Qu, still had a smile on his face, probably because he was satisfied with the result of the conversation, his attitude towards Gao Yuncheng was not bad.What? Gao Yuncheng froze, and then seized by angry. Didn\u2019t Liu Jia\u2019an get the notice from Starlight? And... He glanced at Yu Qinghuan with resentful expression, how could this guy compared with him?If it had not been for his wrong performance on his audition day due to ill health, how could this role have fallen on that goddamn Yu Qinghuan?\u201cDirector Liu,\u201d Gao Yuncheng held his chest with both hands, a face of unconvinced, but still polite to Liu Jia\u2019an, \u201cHow do you know I can\u2019t compare with him if you haven't seen my performance completely.\"Since he was present, how could he leave in a sullen manner because of Liu Jia\u2019an\u2019s words? And he did not believe Yu Qinghuan, a newcomer who had just entered the circle, could match him in acting!\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Liu Jia\u2019an had never been a good-natured person. Seeing Gao Yuncheng being so unappreciative, he immediately flew into rage. However, before Liu Jia\u2019an could drive Gao Yuncheng away, Yu Qinghuan spoke first, \u201cSince he wants to try, Director Liu, why not give him a chance?\u201dLiu Jia\u2019an\u2019s brows wrinkled and he gave Yu Qinghuan a disgruntled glance, wondering if this son wanted to take this opportunity to flinch again.\u201cLet him try!\u201d Before Liu could say anything, Wang Zhensheng said first in a heavy tone, hitting the ground with his crutch, \u201cI\u2019d like to see how wonderful his acting is!\u201dWhy was this old thing so nosy! Gao Yuncheng cursed in his heart, then said fiercely, \u201cBetter than you anyway!\u201d He grabbed the script presented to him by an assistant.\u201c\u2026\u201dPeople on the spot were all struck dumb.As a national first-class actor, Wang Zhensheng was a national treasure in the entertainment industry! Gao Yuncheng even dared to say his acting was better than Wang?! Did he have some brain damage or hit the door?Wang Zhensheng was livid with anger with his beard trembling. He followed Gao Yuncheng and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll have a good look at it with my eyes wide open.\u201dIt was such a coincidence that Gao Yuncheng\u2019s performance was exactly the scene that Yu Qinghuan auditioned for, that was, the scene where Ye Sheng made a scene on the plane.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What he was going to perform was the scene where Ye Sheng wanted to get off the plane, which he thought was simple. Weren\u2019t there rumors that Liu Jia\u2019an was the most stubborn director? Well it seemed the director was quite undeserved his fame since he was also afraid of offending the investors, thought Gao Yuncheng.Pia! Gao Yuncheng threw the script on the table next to him and cleared his throat. When he was about to start his performance, suddenly he felt a sharp stare fell on him. He looked back involuntarily and was almost scared out of his wits.Yu Qinghuan was now standing very close to Gao Yuncheng, holding scissors sullenly, staring at Gao\u2019s face as if he were about to come and stab the other side to death the next second.Gao Yuncheng was afraid of death and cherished his life, but he cherished his face even more. Therefore, when seeing Yu Qinghuan like this, let alone acting, he even couldn\u2019t wait to run away immediately.Yu Qinghuan must intent to destroy him so he could not rob Yu\u2019s role!Gao Yuncheng\u2019s heart was beating wildly. The more he thought about it, the more afraid he felt. He instinctively retreated.The people around him waiting for his performance were getting impatient.So he thought he had the courage to play in The Line of Life and Death? This little star must be crazy! Jiang Qi was muttering to himself when he saw Gao Yuncheng suddenly darting behind a pillar like a rabbit. Gao shouted grimly, \u201cGet Yu Qinghuan away from me! Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t play my role.\u201dJiang Qi, \u201c\u2026\u201dDidn\u2019t he ask for the performance himself?Liu Jia\u2019an didn\u2019t want to waste any more time on him, so he waved to those bystanders to leave and smiled to Gao Yuncheng, \u201cGo back and tell the one behind you, if he wants to squeeze someone into my production team, wait another 100 years!\u201dJiang Qi was more scrupulous than Liu Jia\u2019an and was the first one to notice the abnormity. What triggered Gao Yuncheng\u2019s emotional breakdown since he was so confident for the audition at the beginning?Looking at Gao Yuncheng being pushed by the securities to leave, Jiang Qi turned back to ask Yu Qinghuan whether he knew what had happened, but just got a jump scare on seeing Yu Qinghuan holding a scissor in his hand, \u201cQinghuan, what are you doing with a scissor? Be careful.\u201d\u201cI just cut the label with it.\u201d Yu Qinghuan smiled at him and handed the scissor to the log keeper.Hearing this, Jiang Qi\u2019s doubts were dispelled. Looking at the handsome and vigorous Yu Qinghuan, Jiang Qi was in a good mood, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s rehearse the scenes you\u2019re going to play this afternoon.\u201dLike an elder brother, Jiang Qi put his arm around Yu Qinghuan\u2019s shoulder and left together with him.While in Huo Family, after hanging up the phone, Huo Rong suddenly bounced off the sofa, walked to the back of Huo Qu, poked him who had been staring at the goldfish all day long and was about to turn into a \u201cfish watching stone\u201d, and said ruefully, \u201cStop sitting in a daze, your good friend\u2019s role was nearly robbed.\u201dFinding that his words were too complicated for his younger brother to understand, he said in another way, \u201cYour good friend has been bullied. He is very sad.\u201dHuo Rong didn\u2019t know what attraction these ordinary goldfish had to Huo Qu. Since returning home, Huo Qu had been guarding the fish tank like a treasure, and paid no attention to any other things. Even when eating, he had to keep the fish tank at his hand, just like worrying about it being robbed.No matter what method the whole family used or even got him several difficult problems in quantum mechanics from the research institute, he could not divert his attention.\u201cQinghuan?\u201d Huo Qu\u2019s ears reacted. He finally looked up at Huo Rong and said his first words in two days.Huo Rong almost wept with joy and cried excitedly, \u201cMom! Mom! Come here! Huo Qu has spoken!\u201d His voice was heard throughout the whole living room.Such excitement was like Huo Qu was a baby that just learnt to speak.Ms. Huo rushed down from the upstairs like a wind. The facial mask on her face dropped by half. She pushed Huo Rong aside and looked at Huo Qu pleasantly, \u201cQu, Qu, need your mom? Mom is here. What did you just say? Just tell your mom.\u201dHuo Rong was stunned.Cause he was the one having called her.Huo Qu was indifferent to his mother\u2019s words. He squeezed his head out of Ms. Huo\u2019s arms and looked at Huo Rong, worried, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Qinghuan?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, he was just a little not in the mood.\u201d Huo Rong waved his hand, \u201cHe only needs a little comfort from you.\u201d\u201cComfort?\u201d Huo Qu repeated the word confusedly. The smartest brain in Hua Uni. was in a blank at this time.Comfort\u2026 What was that?So Qinghuan was in sadness and so in need of his comfort?Huo Qu kept holding his fist and walked impatiently up and down in the living room, his eyes flushed with suppress, like a cornered beast.But what on earth was comfort?Huo Rong was startled by his little brother\u2019s behavior, while Mrs. Huo felt more terrible with her face turning white. Huo Qu was a very simple person and also a hair-splitter, if he went on like this, they would not even dare to think about the consequences.Huo Rong gave his chest a hard hammer in regret and walked to his little brother, \u201cHuo Qu\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, he saw Huo Qu suddenly stop and looked at him with excitement, \u201cRong, I, if I let Qinghuan see my fish, would he feel better?\u201dThese two goldfish were the most precious and favorite things given to him by Yu Qinghuan. Since Qinghuan was his good friend, he would like them as well.Qinghuan would definitely feel better, thought Huo Qu.Huo Rong was stunned at first, then his tears gushed out.His younger brother had isolated himself from the world since he was born. Whether illness, sadness, happiness... all his conditions and emotions, he would refrain from telling others.Even his closest family could not enter his world.For more than 20 years, his family had made great efforts, but Huo Qu, like a rock, had always stuck to his own small world and refused to open his heart to anyone else.Now, he was finally like a small snail with its tentacles carefully outstretched but with good expectations, and began to share his likes and feelings with the people around him.Huo Rong wiped her eyes severely, held Huo Qu, and said firmly in a dumb voice, \u201cYes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)Translator: Guy Gone BadWhen Huo Rong took Huo Qu to the filming site, Yu Qinghuan had just finished shooting the final makeup photos.And this time Liu Jia\u2019an looked quite satisfied with this set of photos and praised them without precedent. He asked the assistant to post them on Weibo right after.Poor Yu Qingyu! The weather as very cold and there was no heating devices here. Besides, he had to sustain the perfect state. Even if he nearly got frozen, he still had to pose.After the shooting, he immediately wrapped himself with the Canada Goose Wang Zhensheng delivered him. He even didn\u2019t want to stretch out his hand for the hot water Zhao Qingyuan handed him.\u201cQinghuan!\u201d The filming site was quite noisy, where all casts wearing all kinds of costumes worked their asses off. But Huo Qu saw Yu Qinghuan who was hiding in a corner on the first sight. He called him happily and carried the fish and walked to him.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d asked Yu Qinghuan surprisingly, and then stood up to welcome him.Huo Qu caught a glimpse of Zhao Qingyuan who was next to him warily, then pulled Yu Qinghuan aside and offered his fish tank before him like he was presenting a treasure, \u201cLook!\u201dZhao Qingyuan who got excluded out of this, \u201c\u2026\u201dJust two goddamn fish! Like he would kill them with his Monkey King\u2019s eyes!What is wrong with this dude?!Zhao Qingyuan winked at Yu Qinghuan, wanting him to introduce Huo Qu. But Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t look at his side at all. All his attention was on Huo Qu\u2019s freezing hands.\u201cWhy do you bring me two fish here in such a cold weather?\u201d He then paused, realizing his tone was a little harsh, so he immediately changed a soft voice, \u201cAre you cold?\u201dHuo Qu felt a little wronged by Qinghuan\u2019s blame. He sniffled piteously, and squeezed a word, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you wear gloves?\u201d Yu Qinghuan took the fish tank from him with one hand while pulling open the big side pocket of his down jacket with the other, \u201cCome on. Put your hands in here.\u201d\u201cCareful! Careful!\u201d said Huo Qu anxiously while watching the violently shaking fish tank as if he didn\u2019t hear Yu Qinghuan\u2019s words at all. He quickly went to the other side of Qinghuan and said, \u201cThe fish are jumping out!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m watching.\u201d said Yu Qinghuan blandly. On seeing that his attention was still on the fish, he directly grasped his hands and squeezed them into his pocket and then brought him to the rest room.This is Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s personal rest room, which was decorated with all kinds of furniture and heating facilities. Yu Qinghuan turned on the heater the moment he walked in and then pressed Huo Qu on the couch, saying with a long face, \u201cSit!\u201dHuo Qu\u2019s pet-like intuition told him Qinghuan was not in the mood, so he just sat there straightened up, with his hands on his knees, like he was waiting for Qinghuan\u2019s scolding.Yu Qinghuan now had tons of questions to ask him.How did he know he is shooting here? How did he get here? Did he tell anyone else about this? But on looking at his innocent face, he just couldn\u2019t spit them out.Since Qinghuan didn\u2019t say anything, it made him more upset, thinking, \u201cSo Qinghuan is angry with me. I failed to cheer him up. And he doesn\u2019t like my fish at all.\u201dSuddenly kind of suffocating pains were felt in the chest, not strong but continuous, like the all-pervasive air stuffing up his whole chest, making him nearly lose his breath.This was kind of strange and terrifying feeling. Huo Qu pressed his chest restlessly, nearly crying.When Yu Qinghuan came to himself and saw that Huo Qu was like in great pains, he nearly jumped out of his skin. He just cast everything behind and sat down beside him. He asked Huo Qu anxiously while patting his back to help him breathe, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you sick? Where does it hurt?\u201d\u201cHere.\u201d said Huo Qu while pointing at his heart, \u201cIt hurts a lot.\u201dYu Qinghuan\u2019s face immediately darkened. His heart hurts? This isn\u2019t a good sign. Does he have heart trouble?He patted his back and then got him some hot water, and did anything he could to make him feel better. Until he looked a lot better, Qinghuan started to ask, \u201cHow about now? Feeling any better?\u201dHuo Qu rubbed his chest and then looked at Qinghuan blankly, \u201cYeah, better.\u201dSo weird! Once Qinghuan lean to his side, the pains were gone. What kind of disease is that?Yu Qinghuan heaved a sigh. Though he didn\u2019t say anything, he had already made up his mind to take him to the hospital for a health examination. He had a fever the other day and now a heartache. It totally freaked him out.\u201cQinghuan!\u201d while he was still thinking, a hand pulled his clothes. Yu Qinghuan lowered his head and saw Huo Qu was pulling his clothes gingerly, exactly like the first time he saw him.Yu Qinghuan\u2019s heart immediately softened, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you\u2026are you still upset?\u201dYu Qinghuan got struck dumb, \u201cHm?\u201d\u201cMy second brother told me.\u201d Huo Qu cast a glance at him and immediately got blushed, \u201cHe said you are very sad now.\u201dYu Qinghuan totally had no idea where this came from.Since when does he feel upset? Who is his second brother? How did he know?When glancing at Huo Qu\u2019s worrying face, Yu Qinghuan suddenly understood what was going on. So Huo Qu came here because he thought he was upset?

(2)Translator: Guy Gone BadSince he parents died, no one had ever cared about him like this.His folks were good to him but not in such a thoughtful way. They thought it\u2019d be enough as long as he had clothes to wear and food to eat, while his agent in his precious life thought he was almighty. He wouldn\u2019t notice the subtle changes of his feelings.Huo Qu was the very first one who put his feelings in his heart and cared about him clumsily.Suddenly a kind of sour and sweet feeling filled his chest, like a seed with a little thorn taking root in the soil deep in his heart.Yu Qinghuan asked him chokingly, \u201cSo you came all the way here\u2026only for this trivial matter?\u201d\u201cThis ain\u2019t trivial matter!\u201d Huo Qu talked him back for the very first time, \u201cQinghuan\u2019s matters are all the most important!\u201dSpeaking of which, he looked up at Yu Qinghuan with all expectations in his eyes, \u201cSo\u2026are you feeling better now?\u201d\u201cI am very happy now!\u201d Yu Qinghuan took a deep breath and looked at Huo Qu smilingly, \u201cI am happy because you are here.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Huo Qu immediately jumped up on hearing him, \u201cAre you serious, Qinghuan? But\u2026but I don\u2019t know how to comfort people\u2026\u201dHe made a pause and tried to explain, \u201cI\u2026I\u2019m not a fool. I got myself tested. My IQ is 170-180. I\u2019m not a fool, really. I\u2019m just\u2026I\u2019m\u2026\u201dHe looked anxious with his face turning all red, but he still couldn\u2019t find a suitable word to describe it, while Yu Qinghuan cut in, \u201cI know. I know you are very good at comforting people. I\u2019m not upset at all now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s great.\u201d Huo Qu puckered up his lips shyly and smiled showing a little dimple on his left face.\u201cAre you hungry? Have you had lunch?\u201dHuo Qu touched his belly and said, \u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll cook some ramen for you.\u201dSince having known that Yu Qinghuan could cook, Zhao Qingyuan had stuffed the fridge with a bunch of fast food. Yu Qinghuan routed out a few packs of Japanese ramen among that huge pile. After turning on the induction cooker, he then started to cook ramen while chatting with Huo Qu.It was kind of weird. Even Huo Qu\u2019s families couldn\u2019t find a way to pick up a conversation with Huo Qu. First, Huo Qu didn\u2019t like talking. Second, they always had no idea what Huo Qu was talking about while Huo Qu didn\u2019t understand them either.But Yu Qinghuan was different. He could always accurately extract what he was trying to express from Huo Qu\u2019s words.\u201cThat is to say, you are going abroad for an academic conference in a few days?\u201d asked Yu Qinghuan while opening the lid and putting the ramen in the pot.\u201cMm.\u201d Huo Qu nodded and then added, \u201cI have to go.\u201dYu Qinghuan knew why he added those words. So he smiled at him while squeezing the seasoning bag, \u201cIt\u2019s OK. I will call you then.\u201dSpeaking of which, he saw Huo Qu take out a booklet and quickly write a string of characters.\u201dYu Qinghuan was curious, \u201cWhat are you writing?\u201dHuo Qu then smiled at him innocently, \u201cTo remind myself to bring my phone.\u201dThe hot ramen diluted the coldness in the air. Yu Qinghuan then filled half a bowl of ramen for Huo Qu, \u201cEat while it\u2019s still warm.\u201dHuo Qu nodded and then picked up the chopsticks obediently.Pity that he could barely use chopsticks, plus the Japanese ramen was a little too slippery. He tried a few times but still couldn\u2019t pick up any.Yu Qinghuan couldn\u2019t\u2019 bear to see it. Huo Qu wouldn\u2019t have a bite till the ramen got cold. So he rolled up his sleeves and helped him.He rolled the ramen with the chopsticks and blew them before sending it by Huo Qu\u2019s mouth, saying, \u201cOpen your mouth!\u201dAs na\u00efve as Huo Qu was, he at least knew he was an adult and it was embarrassing to be fed like a baby. He then got all blushed, even his ears. He wanted to step back, but dare not disobey Yu Qinghuan\u2019s words, so he could only implore him, \u201cQinghuan, I\u2026\u201dBut once he opened his mouth, Yu Qinghuan already slipped in a mouthful of ramen, \u201cEat.\u201dOne was feeding while the other was eating. When they nearly finished half of the ramen, Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s exciting and unique voice was heard from outside, \u201cQinghuan, what did you cook this time?\u201dAfter pushing the door open, he immediately threw himself at the ramen and totally forgot that Huo Rong was behind.Huo Rong didn\u2019t mind it, cuz they had known each other for a long time, so he knew what Zhao Qingyuan was like.\u201cAre you Yu Qinghuan? I entrust my little brother to you.\u201d Huo Rong then walked before Qinghuan. When he saw the bowl in Qinghuan\u2019s hand and his little brother\u2019s bulging cheek, he immediately wore a meaningful smile, \u201cI\u2019m Huo Rong, Huo Qu\u2019s second elder brother.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dYu Qinghuan had no idea what to say. He just picked up this poor kid by the road, it turned out he was his boss\u2019 little brother? Why is he always so goddamn lucky?\u201cHi. My pleasure.\u201d poker-faced, Yu Qinghuan shook hands with Huo Rong.\u201cHm?\u201d On hearing their conversation, Zhao Qingyuan who was digging the ramen finally raised his head, looking at Huo Qu blankly, then turned to Huo Rong, \u201cSo this is your genius little brother? He doesn\u2019t look any different from us.\u201dHuo Qu felt someone was staring at him while he was eating ramen. When he raised his head and saw Zhao Qingyuan who he didn\u2019t know at all, he just ignored him.If it had been before, Huo Rong would just leave him alone. But now was different. Huo Qu had changed a lot. So Huo Qu hoped to encourage his little brother to learn to socialize. He then introduced him, \u201cQu, this is Zhao Qingyuan. He is\u2026\u201dBefore he finished his words, Huo Qu suddenly turned his head and looked at Zhao Qingyuan innocently, \u201cBrother Rong, I know him.

How would Qinghuan make a mistake?\u201cEh-hem.\u201d Yu Qinghuan coughed embarrassedly, and said to Zhao Qingyuan, \u201cQingyuan, don\u2019t take it serious.

What about last time?\u201dSpeaking of which, he looked at Yu Qinghuan in a huff. On seeing that meaningful expression on Yu Qinghuan\u2019s face, he suddenly thought of something\u2026\u201cDo you still think I am stupid?\u201dBefore Yu Qinghuan answered his question, he then snorted, \u201cWe\u2019re done!\u201d and then stormed out.\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Huo Qu got flustered, \u201cDid I get you into trouble?\u201d\u201cNo, he was just kidding.\u201d Yu Qinghuan extracted a tissue, wiped off the oil at the corner of his mouth and then switched the topic tactfully, \u201cAre you full?\u201dHuo Qu then shook his head, \u201cNo.\u201dYu Qinghuan lowered his head to look at his watch, and then patted on Huo Qu\u2019s shoulder, \u201cGo back home with your brother and eat. I\u2019m gonna shoot the film later, so I don\u2019t have time to be with you.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna leave.\u201d muttered Huo Qu reluctantly while rubbing the ground with the tiptoe.\u201cBe good.\u201d Yu Qinghuan took off his down jacket, looked into the mirror to make sure his clothes weren\u2019t wrinkled, and then showed Huo Qu out with his hand around his shoulder, \u201cEat some food when you are home.

Yu Qinghuan then turned to Huo Rong and talked to him like he was not his boss at all, \u201cSorry to trouble you to take him to eat some food.\u201d After thinking for a bit, he added, \u201cHuo Qi prefers something light.\u201d\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d Huo Rong said so and then drove his little brother through the whole street for something light.After quite a while did he realize something ain\u2019t no right: Isn\u2019t it a natural thing for him to take his younger brother to eat some food? Why did Yu Qinghuan use the word \u2018trouble\u2019? What\u2019s worse, he promised him!This guy is a wizard!Besides, since when Huo Qu has preferred food? Why didn\u2019t he know?It was red light, so Huo Rong turned to Huo Qu, \u201cYou prefer light food?\u201dHuo Qu even didn\u2019t raise his head but always pinned his eyes on his treasure fish without even blinking.Huo Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dSo he was the na\u00efve one.While at the filming site, since Zhao Qingyuan had a fight with Yu Qinghuan, he had been in a mad state the whole afternoon. Wang Chengcheng even dared not breathe heavily, let alone shooting with him together. No one knew how many times of NG they had. And Liu Jia\u2019an nearly smashed No.1 camera.In most films nowadays, the big-name director was in name only, the actual shooting part was usually performed by the executive director. Liu Jia\u2019an despised this kind of thing. So though he was aged, he still tried to shoot The Line of Life and Death all by himself.Besides, he also had extremely strict demands of the actors\u2019 acting.Wang Chengcheng\u2018s acting skills were not good at all, plus she felt a little upset now, which made things worse. Since too many photographic films were wasted, Liu Jia\u2019an finally lost his hair, \u201cWang Chengcheng, did you buy your diploma in college? Come here and watch your own performance! One would take your as Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s maid if no one tells him!\u201dWang Chengcheng was at least the top actress of Starlight. If it had been some other director, let alone criticizing her, even if it was a bad one, they would put on a smile and praise her \u2018excellent\u2019 performance.However high Wang Chengcheng\u2019s EQ was, she now couldn\u2019t take it and was nearly crying.But anyway she knew she couldn\u2019t offend Liu Jia\u2019an, so she mumbled, \u201cSorry, director Liu, I am a little not myself today. Just give me some time.\u201d and then went back to her rest room under the support of her assistant.Now Liu Jia\u2019an was as mad as a hippo. Even his old friend Jiang Qi was afraid to be around. When he was about to slip away to have a cigarette, Liu Jia\u2019an yelled, \u201cWhere is Yu Qinghuan? Hurry! I\u2019m gonna shoot his part ahead!\u201d\u201cHere! He is coming!\u201d said Jiang Qi while pushing Yu Qinghuan before him. Actually he was a little worried about Qinghuan. To shoot the clip at such a bad time? Oh man! Qinghuan would be screwed. It seemed Qinghuan was out of luck this time!\u201cAre you ready?\u201d The clap-stick boys hurriedly switched the background. Liu Jia\u2019an sat before No.1 camera. He asked so on seeing Qinghuan was rehearsing it himself there for a few times.\u201cYes.\u201d Yu Qinghuan nodded.\u201cOK! Action!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He is from a rich family, has a pretty face. So he is always the focus in the hospital. And over time he has developed into an arrogant man and a womanizer.His medical skills are not bad, but isn't friendly with the patients. He usually leaves the patient alone after the surgery and asks his assistant to take care of the following nursing work.What Yu Qinghuan was going to shoot was a scene how Ye Cheng got along with the patient's family.A nine-year-old little girl had got the thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer was called undying caner. But the younger the patient was, the more fatal.The little girl's mom had cried all day long, desperate and helpless. However the nurse explained to her, she still couldn't feel at ease. So one day when it was about off work, she went to Ye Sheng's office.\"Doctor Ye,\" Long time's insomnia and mental suffering nearly crushed her. Her face looked deadly pale, and she was as skinny as a skeleton, as if even a breeze would make her fall apart. On seeing Ye Sheng, she acted like she was seeing the last straw. She then poured in a sobbing tone, \"How is my daughter Tongtong? Doctor Ye, is the surgery really safe? It's\u2026it's just a small surgery, isn't it?\"Ye Sheng had a date after work but now got held up by a weeping ugly woman. He immediately lost his temper, \"Any surgery has danger! Small surgery? Then why do you do it in our hospital? Huh? For god's sake!\"The woman popped her eyes out while looking at Ye Sheng imploringly. Her legs were so weak that they could barely support her body. She just came to seek a little comfort from the doctor, but received such indifferent words.\"Doctor\u2026Doctor Ye\u2026\"\"Let go!\" Ye Sheng brushed off the woman's hands impatiently, and then flicked his clothes with all loathing in his eyes, \"You have kept nagging about this like a hundred times. Do you think the doctor's time is limitless?\"Speaking of which, he pushed the woman out indifferently and walked away.\"Cut!\" said Liu Jia'an while staring at the scene through No.1 camera, looking not so tense now.Yu Qinghuan contributed the perfect acting, even beyond his expectations. He wasn't like a newcomer at all, who had completely shown Ye Sheng's arrogance and indifference. Every move and every expression was totally Ye Cheng, not any trace of Yu Qinghuan at all.No NG of this scene!Others in the crew were all surprised. They had all despised Yu Qinghuan, thinking he got this role using his connections. But now their attitude towards him had totally changed. When Yu Qinghuan was taking some rest after his part, a lot of people went to say hi.See? This is the entertainment circle!This was the only scene Yu Qinghuan had today. After finishing his part, not long after he poured himself a cup of hot water to warm his hands, Wang Zhensheng waved his hand at him, \"Yu, come here.\"\"Teacher Wang.\" Yu Qinghuan moved to him and greeted him politely.\"Don't be nervous. Sit.\" Said Wang Zhensheng smilingly while giving him a sign to sit next to himself, \"What do you think of your performance just now?\"Yu Qinghuan was stunned by his question. So he immediately thought carefully how he had performed just now and which part could have gone wrong.\"Don't be nervous. Just tell me what's on your mind.\"Yu Qinghuan had no idea what his intention was, so he could only tell honestly, \"Actually I wasn't thinking much. I just acted the way I thought.\"\"That is your biggest problem.\" Wang Zhensheng heaved a sigh, \"Yu, you are the most talented young man I've ever seen. And your acting just now was totally brilliant. But\u2026\"After a pause he then continued, \"Let me ask you. You kind of don't like acting, do you?\"How could that be!Yu Qinghuan wanted to retort, but when the words came at his mouth, he just couldn't spit them out.In his previous life, he had taken acting as a way to make a living, while in this life, he took acting as a burden. He even had never thought whether he really liked acting.\"Yu,\" Wang Zhensheng tried to get up with the support of his crutch, with his sparse gray hair fluttering in the wind, showing his age, \"Your acting skills are better that most people of this circle, or let's say, even better that most who have won acting awards, but it has no soul.\"No soul?Yu Qinghuan tried to ponder on those words. Only when he looked right into Wang Zhensheng's smiling eyes did he took a tumble.When he acted, he always took himself as an onlooker, but not to get into the character completely. If an actor could not acknowledge the role he was acting, how could he make the audience feel the life of that character?On seeing that he understood what he meant, Wang Zhensheng smiled delightfully, and slipped the paper he had already wrote his name on into Yu Qinghuan's hand, \"If you can't figure out what I meant today,\" he then pointed at the trash can, \"this piece of paper would lie in there.\"On seeing Yu Qinghuan's astonishing expression, Wang Zhensheng smiled, \"Though I'm tired, I still have my place in Capital People's Grand Theatre. You have not shooting tomorrow, do you? I will show you around there. Maybe it'll help with your acting.\"Capital People's Grand Theatre!It was every actor's dream to learn something in there! Even if Yu Qinghuan's ambition was not in the entertainment, he still couldn't refuse such a rare chance!He pursed his lips and then bowed low to Wang Zhensheng, \"Thank you, Mr. Wang. Sorry to trouble you then.\"Wang Zhensheng shook his head and walked away with a smile on his face.After he left, Yu Qinghuan just sat there thinking about his freaking luck! But before he figured out anything, he was already woken up by a burst of pressing ringing sound. He took out his phone and saw it was Yu Xin.\"Qinghuan, I'm going back tomorrow afternoon!\" Yu Xin sounded quite excited, \"You know what? Everything is done! Your folks are really nice. They gave me a lot of canned yellow peach, saying you like it. I know you are free tomorrow afternoon. Come pick me up at the airport.\"\"I don't think so.\" Yu Qinghuan frowned. And when he was about to explain, Yu Xin already started to whine on the other end, \"Come on, Qinghuan! Do you even have a bit of humanity, huh? So many cans of yellow peach. I can't manage them myself!\"\"But I'm going to the Capital People's Grand Theatre with Teacher Wang tomorrow,\" Yu Qinghuan felt kind of embarrassed, \"Maybe you can deliver them home?\"\"Wait!\" Yu Xin raised his voice, \"What did you say? You are going to the Capital People's Grand Theatre?Yu Qinghuan, \"Hm.\"Yu Xin got excited, \"Is it that Capital People's Grand Theatre? And which Wang?\"Yu Qinghuan said, \"It is that Capital People's Grand Theatre, with Wang Zhensheng.\"After a moment's weird silence, Yu Xin said decisively on the other end of line, \"You go to the Grand Theatre! I will carry those cans back even at the cost of my life!\"Yu Qinghuan, \"\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After He Did This, Zhao Qingyuan could not Get up from Bed, Crying! (1)Translator: Guy Gone BadOn that day when Zhao Qingyuan slammed the door and left, he thought Yu Qinghuan would chase him out to apologize so he could pretend to be entangled by the latter and then made peace with him.This was the normal process after the quarrel between good friends!However, what he had never expected was that Yu Qinghuan was a person who did not play according to common sense.Zhao Qingyuan understood that Yu Qinghuan was young with strong self-esteem so he could forgive Yu\u2019s absence on the first day, but the latter still showed no appearance on the second day.Not only did he not come, but also he followed others out without even informing him!\u201cFor god\u2019s sake!\u201d Looking at Zhao Qing Yuan, who was braving the anger all over, as if possessed by deicide, his broker gave him a wry smile. He kneaded Zhao\u2019s shoulder and tried to persuade him, \u201cYou are ten years older than Qinghuan. What kind of disputes are you having with him? Isn\u2019t that just about an apology?\u201dEven his broker could not tolerate him to lose his temper like a girl.However, as soon as the broker mentioned this, Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s anger immediately came up, \u201cI tell you! From now on Yu Qinghuan is off my list! We are done!\u201dThen Zhao Qingyuan thought it for a moment and felt a little unintelligent about his unilateral break-up.So he took out his cell phone and sent a Weibo.Zhao Qing Yuan: Friendship over [Goodbye] @ Yu QinghuanAfter posting it, Zhao Qingyuan did not quit but stared at the screen for his fans\u2019 comments.Since his fans loved him so much, hearing their idol end his friendship with Yu Qinghuan, they would unconditionally defend him and then condemn Yu Qinghuan together, thought Zhao Qing Yuan.Well, facts had proved that he obviously thought too much.The number of new messages snowballed at the speed visible to the naked eyes. Zhao Qingyuan felt himself stupid in an instant when he clicked into these comments.Hadn\u2019t his fans agreed to share weal and woe with their idol? All of them were commenting like he was telling jokes.[yoyoyoyo~ Our Yuan has got a hard mouth again. Gee.][yoyoyoyo~ Why you @ Qinghuan on Weibo? Aren\u2019t you on the same set? You acted like a grumpy young girl! , Guys, keep rank!][yoyoyoyo~ I can\u2019t help but look at the time in the lower right corner of the screen. Must you say this early in the morning? What body position is it for your breakup sex, by the way?][yoyoyoyo~ I feel sorry for our Yuan, he was abandoned by Qinghuan just because of his reticent and indifferent public image.\u201d\u2026Liu Jia\u2019an released the first photos of The Line Between Life and Death this morning. All the netizens had known Zhao and Yu were on the same cast, so they felt free to tease them two.As a steel-like straight man, Zhao Qingyuan only surfed the internet for photos of beautiful women and skin flicks, and had never discovered those fields as his fans said, so he just threw away his phone and decided to quit the internet for one day.However, Yu Qinghuan, whom he bitterly cursed, followed Wang Zhensheng to the Capital People\u2019s Grand Theater.On the stage, the actors were rehearsing the play Su Tungpo, which happened to be Su Tungpo\u2019s disaster relief scene in Hangzhou.The actor playing Su Tungpo was wearing a loose blue and white gown. Blazing with anger in his eyes, he denounced the inaction of the subordinate officials.Compared with ordinary TV plays and movies, stage play was more exaggerating. The emotions of the actors were more outward, and the movements were also more vigorous. Accompanied by sorrowful music and the amplification effect of the stage, the performance would be very infectious.\u201cSo\u201d, Wang Zhensheng looked at Yu Qinghuan with a smile, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\u201cI cannot do it.\u201d Yu Qinghuan sighed. His slightly impetuous heart had finally settled down since his rebirth.It was not easy to be able to perform in a stage play. The actors\u2019 actions, expressions and even voices must be consistent. If they were not able to be fully integrated into the role, the performance would be disastrous.Not only that, on the empty stage, the actors\u2019 psychological quality must be strong, otherwise they could not be able to support such a big stage with their performance at all.Wang Zhensheng shook his head, \u201cYou\u2019ll never know whether you can do it if you don\u2019t give it a try.\u201dYu Qinghuan seemed wised up, \u201cYou mean...\u201dWang Zhensheng walked before the stage, grabbed the person in charge and said a few words. The latter immediately showed a respectful expression on his face, raised his hand to suspend the performance on the stage, handed Yu Qinghuan a script and said to him with a smile, \u201cGo up and have a try. This is the first time Mr. Wang has brought someone here.\u201dYu Qinghuan thanked him, took a quick glance at the first few pages of the script, took a deep breath and stepped onto the stage.Standing on the stage was totally different from the sitting on the seats below. Although Yu Qinghuan did not suffer from stage fright, he was still not as comfortable as when he was on set.He first simulated the scene in his mind and read the lines out out according to the script.When he was filming, he never felt that he was poor in acting. However, this time, he suddenly realized his shortcomings.Not only was his acting immature, but his infectivity insufficient.He spoke with his own voice, and if he raised the volume slightly, he would not only have his voice cracked, but also feel pains in his throat. Although unwilling to admit it, Yu Qinghuan knew in his heart that his acting was simply not good enough.He was once smug that he had won many awards and felt that he no longer needed to improve his acting skills.\u201cProfessor Wang,\u201d after only a short performance, Yu Qinghuan was somewhat breathless. He stepped off the stage and walked beside Wang Zhensheng with his eyes shining, \u201cthank you so much.Wang Zhensheng found that although the boy realized his shortcomings, he was not sad and lost. Instead, his whole body was full of unprecedented energy. The elder patted him on the shoulder with relief, \u201cGood boy.\u201dThis boy had lived up to his recognition.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After He Did This, Zhao Qingyuan could not Get up from Bed, Crying! (2)Translator: Guy Gone BadWhen Yu Qinghuan left the Grand Theater, he was alone with a camera from Wang Zhensheng in his hand. The predecessor asked him to film his daily practice and then to review the recordings to find his own shortcomings of his acting.Wang Zhensheng also suggested he find a vocal music teacher to practice his vocalization, which would give him an advantage at capturing his original sound when filming.Looking down at the camera in his hand, Yu Qinghuan sighed with a complex complexion.He obviously had not planned to enter the entertainment circle again after his rebirth, but it happened that things were not under his control, as if everyone was pushing him forward. As a perfectionist, he could not bear to muddle along.Even if he might quit being an actor in the future, he still wanted to improve his acting skills as much as possible during the contract period, which led his further cultivation in the entertainment circle and hardships to withdraw even if he was willing to.He glanced at the couple passing by enviously, slouched, and stroked his camera. If things went on like this, when would he be able to have a real relationship as he wanted?Alas, what a hard life!Yu Qinghuan was not a fun-loving person. Although he did not have his part today, he still returned to the movie set. Unexpectedly, he met Yu Xin at the gate.\u201cCome on, help me carry the cans!\u201d Yu Xin dragged half a sack of canned food, tired like a dead dog. The moment he saw Yu Qinghuan, stars flew out of his eyes.\u201cWhat a relief!\u201d In such a cold winter, Yu Xin tired out a head of hot sweat. The moment he entered Yu Qinghuan\u2019s room, he immediately collapsed on the sofa.\u201cDude, thanks for your hard work.\u201d Yu Qinghuan poured him a cup of hot water, watched him gulp it down and laughed, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a big red envelope for the New Year.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Yu Xin put down the cup and glared at him. \u201cDo you think you are quite rich now? Let me tell you, after buying the house, you will have nothing left! You may even lack money for clothes.\u201dWith a large sum of money donated without blinking an eye, Yu Qinghuan was still spending money like water! What made Xin Yu even angrier was that he was, to some extent, an accomplice!\u201cI need some sleep, don\u2019t bother me.\u201d Afraid of seeing Yu Qinghuan would make himself angry with internal injuries, Yu Xin left the word, then pushed the door and went into the bedroom.In fact, even if Yu Xin did not say so, Yu Qinghuan would not bother him. Yu just opened the camera Wang Zhensheng bestowed him and recalled today\u2019s scene at the Grand Theater. When he was ready to practice again, there was a sharp knock at the door.Afraid of disturbing Yu Xin, Yu Qinghuan trotted to open the door before he could even turn off the camera. Unexpectedly, it was Zhao Qingyuan.\u201cYou\u2019re finally willing to come back.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan coldly said such words, with his chin raised, like a cock equipped with full fighting capacity, came in with his head held high.\u201cEh-hem!\u201d Yu Qinghuan thought of the parrot at the sight of him and explained with a smile while restraining himself from laughing, \u201cI wanted to visit you, but I didn\u2019t expect you to come already.\u201dBefore Zhao Qingyuan could talk back, Yu Qinghuan stuffed a canned yellow peach into his arms, \u201cI have a specialty for you. Do you like it?\u201d\u201cYou wanna bribe me with a can?\u201d Zhao Qingyuan snorted, paused, glanced at Yu Qinghuan, and said wearing that long face, \u201cthen... I... I\u2019ll try it first. You\u2019re dead if it taste awful!\u201dZhao Qingyuan drew out a knife from not-know-where, pried open the can, and eagerly scooped a spoonful into his mouth.The yellow peach was thick with slight hardness. Took a bite and the sweet juice immediately overflew the whole oral cavity. Its cool and refreshing flavor was very special in winter.Zhao Qingyuan originally wanted to stop after eating only one bite, but he could not stop after eating more than half of it. Finally, Yu Qinghuan, fearing that Zhao would have a stomachache after eating too much cold food, stretched out his hand and grabbed the can directly.\u201cLet me have another bite!\u201d Licking the sweet yellow peach juice on his lips, Zhao Qingyuan had long forgotten his anger. He leaned to Yu Qinghuan and said, \u201cjust one more bite.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too cold for your stomach.\u201d Yu Qinghuan refused, but Zhao Qingyuan turned a deaf ear to him. Taking advantage of Yu Qinghuan\u2019s inattention, he grabbed the can, lifted it directly and poured the left yellow peach into his mouth even without using a spoon.Yu Qinghuanwatched him, dumbfounded, until the other party slipped away secretly holding two cans.He had no choice but to let him go. He took this opportunity to count the number of the cans and sent them to the staff in the film crew as a gift.That night, Zhao Qingyuan did not resist the temptation and ate another canned yellow peach. As a result, the next day he was lying on the bed with a stomachache, whining all the time and refusing to get up. Yu Qinghuan was angry and almost choked Zhao to death with the stomach medicine.\u201cI was wrong, Qinghuan,\u201d Zhao Qingyuan apologized to him. Although his voice was soft and weak, he did not forget to take out his mobile phone and refresh his Weibo, long forgotten about the decision to quit the internet for a whole day.\u201cYou deserve it.I told you not\u2026\u201d Without finishing his words, Zhao Qingyuan suddenly exclaimed, and struggled to jump off the bed.It nearly scared the shit out of Yu Qinghuan, \u201cWhat's wrong with you?\u201d\u201cLook at this!\u201d Zhao Qingyuan angrily handed the mobile phone to Yu Qinghuan and cursed angrily, \u201cThese bloody paparazzi! What the hell are all these gossips!\u201dYu Qinghuan looked at the mobile phone, only to find that the scene when Zhao Qingyuan entered his room was filmed! Since the latter was unable to go to the movie set due to illness the next day, the media coverage was simply... wonderful.[Yu Qinghuan, a man sleeping in the bed of Zhao Qingyuan, the best actor winner!][Big news! Zhao Qingyuan sneaked into a handsome rookie\u2019s room of the same set late at night and could not even crawl out of bed the next day.][Zhao Qingyuan, the best actor winner, had an anal injury, and the \u2018criminal\u2019 turned out to be...]\u201cShocked! After he did this, Zhao Qingyuan could not get up from bed crying.\"\u2026.Yu Qing Huan was totally speechless.The place where they lived now was a three-star hotel close to the filming set. Before the actors moved in, the film crew had already done the clean-up work. So it was very abnormal for those paparazzi to sneak in.\u201cFuck those goddamn media!\u201d Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s face turned all red with anger and he could not contain his temper at all. \u201cWe should find someone to give them a good lesson!\u201dYu Qinghuan was afraid that he might lose controle, so he quickly comforted him, \u201cAll right, stay calm. I\u2019ll ask Director Liu about how to deal with it.\u201dYu Qinghuan turned to leave. While, Zhao Qing yuan\u2019s faint voice sounded behind him just as he gathered pace. \u201cQinghuan, even if we really did something, you should be the one who cannot crawl out of bed.\u201dYu Qinghuan took a deep breath, turned around coldly, and hurled a word at Zhao Qingyuan, \u201cGet out!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Would they also leak the clips of his The Line of Life and Death?On that very day the whole crew began the thorough check, from the filming site to the hotel, even the actors\u2019 rest rooms, every single place they could think of. Even a hair hidden in a corner could be smoked out, let alone a hidden camera.But even so, Liu Jia\u2019an didn\u2019t feel any better.

And when he was about to say something, Yu Qinghuan who had been keeping silent suddenly cut in, \u201cWell\u2026I remembered something. When Qingyuan went to my room, my camera was on.\u201dIn an instant, two pair of shining eyes turned to him at the same time.Yu Qinghuan explained, \u201cActually I was practicing the scene I was gonna shoot the next day when Qingyuan came.

Put it on your Weibo now!\u201dNow the whole Weibo got exploded by Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s new update, especially his fans.It was true they always rooting for Zhao Qingyuan and Yu Qinghuan being a couple, but that was just for kidding.

Usually he would have already held his phone and browsed the comments. But now he even had no desire to pick up his phone.Yu Qinghuan also saw those comments and knew what he was wrestling with.Actually this was also a reason he dared not to get close to anyone in his previous life. And in this life, he just wanted to distance himself from this circle to be in a relationship.He really couldn\u2019t bear to see Zhao Qingyuan get hurt because of him.\u201cGet yourself together!\u201d He elbowed Zhao Qingyuan who was crouching in the bed, and then pulled down the screen to show the rest comments, saying, \u201cWhat you just saw is only a small part of them. Most of your fans still take on your side.\u201dZhao Qingyuan didn\u2019t want to look at it but still raised his head involuntarily\u2026[So it\u2019s not true?! I don\u2019t know. I kinda wished it\u2019s true\u2026][Same here. I also\u2026][Am I the only who fancy their canned yellow peach. I searched it on Taobao but got no result.][You are not alone. I can tell our Yuan really enjoyed it. I also want it badly, but don\u2019t know where to buy it.][The media really have no bottom line. Even it\u2019s true, so what? It\u2019s his choice whether to love a man or a woman. Anyway I\u2019m gonna follow him and be his fan forever!]Seeing Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s face loosened up, Yu Qinghuan added, \u201cDon\u2019t give up on those who really love you for that small part of narrow-minded people.]Zhao Qingyuan didn\u2019t say anything with his head down.And when Yu Qingyuan tried to say something more, he suddenly found that Qingyuan\u2019s shoulders were shaking dramatically. So it turned out he was trying to hold back his laughter.\u201cQinghuan, you\u2026I\u2019m just not used of you being so serious.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dIf he spent another second to comfort Qingyuan, he would go hit the wall!Yu Qinghuan then stood up and strode out. When he was about to push the door open, Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s voice was heard from behind, \u201cQinghuan, thank you. I feel much better now.\u201dYu Qinghuan stopped and responded, \u201cHm.\u201dAnd at this time on the other hand, Huo Qu had already got on the plane flying to America. Due to the bad weather, they had to go one week earlier, even leaving him no time to say goodbye to Yu Qinghuan, which made him very upset.Even though he was wearing that unpleasant expression, among those old men with white beard and white hair, his breathtaking face still was an eye appeal, making Cheng Ya, who went to the World Physics Exchange Meeting with her father, peep at him now and then. Finally she couldn\u2019t hold it and move to him for some chat-up lines.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Cheng Ya,\u201d A girl at her early twenties, the best time of one\u2019s life, having a pretty face that no one could resist. She gave him a sweet smile and stretched out her right hand, \u201cSo you are Huo Qu? My dad often talks about you at home, saying you are a genius.\u201dHuo Qu cast a glance at her poker-faced, and then turned his face to the other side.Cheng Ya never expected Huo Qu would ignore her. She was stunned and immediately got blushed of shame.She was pretty, a princess both at home and in school. Those boys all liked her. And now suddenly she met a guy who totally ignored her, she felt a little offended and also had a special feeling indescribable.And with that kind of indescribable feeling, she tried to hold back that kind of shameful feeling. So she stood in front of Huo Qu and questioned him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to me?\u201dBut this time Huo Qu even didn\u2019t looked at her. He just went round her and sat on his own seat.\u201cHuo Qu!\u201d This time Cheng Ya got really pissed off. Regardless of her pride, she stretched her hand to grab his clothes and said, \u201cYou have to explain this before you sit!\u201dAnd the luggage in her hand, bang, fell on the floor and nearly hit her own feet.Huo Qu looked at Cheng Ya who was nearly crying, and then lowered his head to look at the luggage, he then understood what was going on.So this woman stopped him only wanting him to put her luggage on the rack?He was in a hurry to sit on his seat and send Yu Qinghuan a message. So he hesitated no more after knowing Cheng Ya\u2019s intention and helped her lifted up the luggage and put them on the rack with all the strength he had.Cheng Ya had been angry with him. But now he even helped her with her luggage though he still didn\u2019t talk to her. She immediately turned to be happy. She heard from her dad that Huo Qu was kind of a freak\u2026So he didn\u2019t mean to ignore her on purpose. Or maybe because she was too pretty, so he felt too shy to talk to her?\u201cHuo Qu, thank you!\u201d Cheng Ya blushed, and waved her hand which was still holding a corner of his clothes, \u201cYou are so cute.\u201dHuo Qu, \u201c?\u201dHadn\u2019t he already put away the luggage for her? Why was she still holding his clothes?He glanced at Cheng Yu blandly and moved his body trying to pull his clothes away from her hand but failed.What on earth was going on?Cheng Ya was still nagging by his ear, \u201cDo you feel a little shy? It\u2019s OK. I understand. What about we sit together? I\u2019ll ask my dad to change his seats with you.\u201dHuo Qu felt more confused. What did she mean changing seats? Why did he have to change the seat?Seeing that he still remained silent, Cheng Yu was confirmed he was just being shy.The youngest and most outstanding physicists of Hua Uni. was being shy in front of her!That kind of cognition made her feel the thrill of conquering. She flattened her hair on the temples with her lips curled up and then tried to tease Huo Qu, \u201cI know you want to sit with me, right? I knew it. And you even helped me with my luggage.\u201dHuo Qu still didn\u2019t get what she was trying to say. He was quite anxious because he wanted to go back to his own seat now.He tried to think of every word Cheng Ya had said and analyze what she was trying to say. And when the word luggage hit his mind, her eyes suddenly shone.He helped her put away her luggage=she grasped his clothes and wouldn\u2019t let go, so\u2026Huo Qu caught a glimpse of Cheng Ya and then raised his hands to take her luggage from the rack and put it back by her feet, \u201cHere.\u201dCheng Ya, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was almost time that the stewardess started to check the shelf, Huo Qu still hadn\u2019t found his own seat.And it happened that this group of scientists was all unfamiliar to Huo Qu. When they saw that he was walking up and down in the cabin, they thought Huo Qu the genius was thinking something serious, sighing in their hearts that geniuses were really different from common people, and they all said hello to him.\u201cHi, Professor Huo!\u201d\u201cProfessor Huo, it\u2019s really an honor to meet you!\u201d\u201cProfessor Huo, if\u2026I mean if you have some time, can we talk about something about astrophysics?\u201d\u2026Huo Qu was a good-mannered young man. So whenever someone talked to him, he would stop to nod as a response.His face was quite deceptive, comely, and also majestic when he was serious. So everyone who passed by didn\u2019t notice his predicament.Finally it was Cheng Ya\u2019s father who noticed something ain\u2019t no right. He rushed to him and put him back in his own seat.Actually he saw everything when his daughter was talking to Huo Qu. He didn\u2019t plan to let his daughter have a relationship so early. But things would be different if that person was Huo Qu.Huo was young and handsome physicist with a bright future. Besides, he had a kind heart. He was an ideal candidate for his son-in-law. What was more, Huo Qu\u2019s genes could only be seen once in a hundred years. And they would have a baby, maybe it\u2019d be a genius without parallel like Huo Qu!He had been pampering his imagination all the time, so he didn\u2019t stop his daughter picking up a conversation with Huo. But what he hadn\u2019t expected was Huo Qu showed no interests in his daughter at all!Cheng Ya\u2019s father peeped at Huo Qu\u2019s charming side face. He then rolled his eyes and decided to make good use of his \u201cfirst come first served\u201d advantage to pocket this good seedling home!Since his daughter failed, it\u2019s OK! He would \u201ctake him down\u201d in person!\u201cEh-hem! Eh-hem!\u201d Ya\u2019s father dry coughed trying to attract Huo Qu\u2019s attention. Pity that Huo Qu was totally focused on his phone and ignored him completely!Before Huo Qu went out, he had learnt from Huo Rong how to send messages again and again. Now he was texting awkwardly according to the tips he wrote on his notebook.He was sweating all over fearing that he ain\u2019t got enough time. But the more anxious he was, the more mistakes he made. He sent out a few messages but all with messy code.\u201cProfessor Huo, are you sending a message?\u201d Ya\u2019s father waited on and on and finally could hold it and tried to pick up a talk.\u201cHm.\u201d Huo Qu responded, still with his head down. Actually his palms were totally wet with sweats.It was difficult! It was really difficult to send a message!\u201cMaybe I can help.\u201d said Ya\u2019s father. After a pause, he dropped his pride and added, \u201cI am an expert on sending messages.\u201dThis sentence successfully attracted Huo Qu\u2019s attention. He immediately turned around and handed his phone Ya\u2019s father seriously, \u201cSorry to trouble you.\u201d\u201cNo trouble! No trouble!\u201d Ya\u2019s father, who thought he had left a good impression in Huo Qu\u2019s heart, pleasantly took up the phone and promised, \u201cWhat\u2019s the content? Just read it to me. I type super-fast!\u201dHuo Qu licked his lips and smiled showing a happy dimple on his left face, \u201cOK.\u201d\u201cProfessor Huo,\u201d Ya\u2019s father tried to cotton up with him while typing, \u201cWhat do you think of my daughter Ya?\u201dHuo Qu looked at him blandly, totally didn\u2019t get what he was trying to say.Ya\u2019s father had also heard a little about Huo Qu, so he knew maybe his question was a little inappropriate and hard for him to comprehend, so he immediately changed another way, \u201cThe girl who talked to you is my daughter. What do you think of her?\u201dHuo Qu, \u201c?\u201dHe still didn\u2019t get what Ya\u2019s father was trying to say.Huo Qu bit his lips looking quite embarrassed. He racked his brain and finally remembered that his second brother had ever said that when someone brought up his kid before you, actually he wanted you to praise his kid.On thinking of that, Huo Qu patted on Ya\u2019s father\u2019s shoulder seriously, \u201cCongratulations!\u201dYa\u2019s father, \u201c\u2026\u201dBeing choked by this word for quite some time, Ya\u2019s father nearly sent a wrong message. When he accidentally looked into Huo Qu\u2019s anxious eyes, he realized he made a mistake and immediately corrected it.Ya\u2019s father felt really frustrated now.He just wants a smart son-in-law. Why is it so hard?Under the urge of anger, he decided not to hide his real intention anymore. He decided to say it directly!\u201cProfessor Huo, my daughter is studying physics in Hua Univ.. Do you have a girlfriend? What about I introduce her to you?\u201d After a pause, he continued with a tempting tone, \u201cAnd then you can study together and do experiments together. Isn\u2019t it a good idea?\u201d\u201cWhy do we have to study together?\u201d asked Huo Qu while looking at Ya\u2019s father, confused, \u201cI can do it by myself.\u201dYa\u2019s father, \u201c\u2026\u201dBut he kept brainwashing Huo Qu, \u201cA man and a woman would make a job easier.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s also easy for me to do experiments myself.\u201d said Huo Qu innocently.Ya\u2019s father, \u201c\u2026\u201dForget it! He decided to give up on this son-in-law-to-be!It is a proud thing to have a talented son-in-law!

Some kids accidentally broke into a minefield, and nearly half of the village was blown up. Peng Cheng played by Yu Qinghuan and Le Chen played by Wang Chengcheng had just got off the plane and directly went for the rescue operation.Among a bunch of serious and also anxious doctors, Ye Sheng who wore a long face looked quite conspicuous.And what Yu Qinghuan needed to do was to express such \u201cantipathetic\u201d feeling.Liu Jia\u2019an was good at full-length shots. And his films were famous for the aesthetic but uncluttered full-length shots. So he was extra strict with the group scenes.When it finally passed, Yu Qinghuan and others had done NG for four times. So on hearing that Liu Jia\u2019an said yes, everyone felt much relieved.In this group scene, Yu Qinghuan and Wang Chengcheng were the ML and FL. In order to show that kind of racing against time feeling, they had to keep rushing forward again and again and again, which was quite strength consuming. Yu Qingchuan was OK, but Wang Chengcheng nearly collapsed.Fortunately Yu Qinghuan supported him, or she would really sit on the ground, which would be embarrassing for an actress.\u201cThank you, Yu.\u201d After resting for a few seconds holding against the pillar, Wang Chengcheng regained her elegance as usual. She then turned around and gave Yu Qinghuan a soft smile, \u201cYou did me another favor.\u201dWhen before Yu Qinghuan, she never held her head high as a senior, looking quite accommodating.Yu Qinghuan shook his head, \u201cChengcheng, don\u2019t say that. That\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d\u201cOh come on.\u201d Wang Chengcheng smiled, and then put her white and smooth hand over Yu Qinghuan\u2019s shoulder, \u201cLast time when Director Liu yelled at me, it is also you who debarrassed me.\u201dYu Qinghuan was a little startled, and immediately understood what Wang Chengcheng was indicating.While Liu Jia\u2019an was yelling at her, and she had to stop her part and went back to adjust herself, Yu Qinghuan passed the first shooting and even got praised by Liu Jia\u2019an.It would have been nothing if he was an experienced actor, but he was an absolute newbie in this circle.It was kind of like slapping Wang Chengcheng in her face.\u201cQinghuan?\u201d On seeing he wasn\u2019t talking for quite a while, she waved her hand before his eyes and said gently, \u201cActually, I am loyal to my friends. I will keep those who have ever helped me in my heart, always.\u201dAfter a pause, she looked at Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes smilingly. \u201cSo when you got something on mind, you can come to me.\u201dSpeaking of which, she patted Yu Qinghuan\u2019s shoulder and walked away elegantly.Watching her walk away gracefully, Yu Qinghuan heaved a sigh in his heart, thinking he had offended Wang Chengcheng to the ground.He ain\u2019t no fool like other newcomers. If he really took Wang Chengcheng as a good friend, he wouldn\u2019t even know when he would step on a landmine.When he was thinking how to deal with her, Yu Xin\u2019s penetrating loud voice was heard from behind, \u201cQing\u2014huan! Qinghuan!\u201dIt was exactly like the way when they won the lottery last time.\u201cI haven\u2019t bought any lottery after that!\u201d thought Yu Qinghuan. At this time, Yu Xin had already run into his face, with his fat symmetrical face shaking regularly.\u201cQinghuan!\u201d Holding Qinghuan\u2019s hands tightly, Yu Qin raised his eyes and looked at him, \u201cBe it rich or poor, friends should always stick together!\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026Human language!\u201dYu Xin, \u201cOh.\u201dYu Xin, \u201cTell you what! The Asian principal of Chicly has just contacted me, wanting you to be the spokesman of their dust coat!\u201dChicly was a French entry lux that had entered the market of Hua Country these years, targeting those white collars. Though it could not compare with those luxury brands, it had its own style.And now Chicly wants to cooperate with Yu Qinghuan!Xin Yun felt like being carried away!\u201cAnd I have promised them. I knew you are free tomorrow morning. We\u2019re going for the audition then!\u201d\"They...How did you know about me?\" Yu Qinghuan was kind of confused. He was only a newcomer who seldom showed his face would be picked by Chicly as their spokesman! Maybe it was because of his good luck after his rebirth, but he couldn\u2019t stay poised now.\u201dOh, here.\u201d Yu Xin clapped his hands, \u201cSo I told you you are a lucky dog! One day the Asian principal of Chicly saw your first photo of The Line of Life and Death on Weibo by accident and found you are very suitable for their dust coat, so they want you to have an audition.\u201dSeriously?!After keeping a silent for a while, Yu Qinghuan turned to Yu Xin blandly, \u201cDo you know if there\u2019s any temple near here? I want to burn some incense.\u201d Then he could beg the heaven to take back his weird good luck!Actually he didn\u2019t have any ambition in the entertainment circle. He just wanted to be an ordinary person. Why is it so hard?\"No, Qinghuan,\" Yu Xin wailed. \u201cIf you still need to burn incense for good luck, what about us?\u201dAfter a short pause, he looked at Yu Qinghuan wickedly, like he had known what Qinghuan was up to, \u201cDo you still want to buy lotteries? Count me in this time, huh?\u201dYu Qinghuan touched his forehead, \u201cDude, I won\u2019t buy lotteries. So drop it.\u201d\"All right,\" said Yu Xin disappointedly. When he was about to ask more, he suddenly remembered something and stopped, then turned around and held his phone at Yu Qinghuan, \u201cQinghuan, make a pose!\u201dYu Qinghuan immediately adjusted his pose instinctively. After Yu Xin took the photo, he then asked, \u201cWhat is this for? Chicly asks for it?\u201d\"Of course not.\" Yu Xin grinned at Yu Qinghuan, and said reasonably, \u201cI want to forward a koi on Weibo using your photo!\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Besides, having seen innumerable cyberbully in his precious life, he gave up the habit of playing with mobile phones over time. However, the main answer was that he had no family and no one would contact him.Therefore, it was not until he returned to the hotel that he saw the text message from Huo Qu.Probably this was the first time Huo Qu had sent a text message since his messages looked unpolished with the first few were all scrambled. It seemed he consulted others later to fully express his meaning.Yu Qinghuan did not expect Huo Qu to leave ahead of schedule. He sighed regretfully and felt a little disappointed. He had planned to send the canned food to Huo Qu the next day, but Huo Qu went abroad when the canned food was ready.Yu Qinghuan tried his best to use the simplest words to reply Huo Qu, urging him to have good meals, be sure to follow his companion closely when outing, never act alone, etc. Finally, a short message sent out in two pieces since it exceeded the word limits.After the message was sent out, he waited for a long time without waiting for a response from the other party. He guessed that Huo Qu should be on the plane now, so he withdrew from the text message and opened his Weibo.Because of the \u201caccident\u201d last time, Zhao Qingyuan was still a little depressed these days. Yu Qinghuan decided to forward the clarifying video by Zhao Qingyuan to support his remarks. Unexpectedly, he got startled by a huge wave of comments and private messages just after entering his Weibo account.When he opened the messages, he didn\u2019t know whether to cry or to laugh. Almost all the comments was asking what brand of canned yellow peach Zhao Qingyuan was eating in the video.Perhaps even the media could not expect this in the end, the biggest beneficiary of the piece of gossip was not Yu Qinghuan, the unknown little newbie, nor Zhao Qingyuan, the former\u2019s competitor, but a canned yellow peach!Everyone knew Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s family was rich. It was also said that he had all kinds of private planes and yachts in his house. Therefore, how delicious would the canned yellow peach be to make him unable to stop eating even having a stomachache!After watching it, all the audiences wanted to buy the same canned yellow peaches.Failing to find the one bought by Zhao Qingyuan after foraging on all the major e-commerce apps, they could not help but swarm into Yu QinghHuan\u2019s Weibo comment box.Yu Qinghuan was quite satisfied with the result.In fact, his hometown had long wanted to build a cannery and even had a detailed planning. However, there was no investment at all and they had to keep an empty stomach on a treasure land. Now the money was finally in place, and the cannery could be built soon.The canned food was scheduled in mass production next spring. So he could seize the opportunity coming along to publicize.Although those netizens were forgetful, no matter how small the chance was, he could not let it slip away.After thinking about the wording, Yu Qinghuan sent an explanation on Weibo, with his winning of the lottery and investment stuff hidden, and forwarded Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s Weibo.Netizens stationing in the comment area of Yu Qinghuan\u2019s Weibo had not expected he would update his Weibo, all of them were surprised to find two pieces at one time when refreshing it.[Qinghuan sent a Weibo? Oh man! I think something wrong with my eyes!][\uff3f\uff08:\u0437\u300d\u2220\uff09\uff3fSure enough, I could not expect too much from my \u2018husband\u2019.

Qinghuan is simply magic! After getting familiar with him, our Yuan also updates less than before!][Exactly! I am also enchanted by him! Although he hardly posts on Weibo or say nothing on his posts, I am still squatting down under his homepage every day.]Although buzzing with discussion, netizens did not know Yu Qinghuan was actually thinking himself as a newbie with little popularity. He knew his Weibo rife with fans and comments all because of Zhao Qingyuan. Therefore, he never took this seriously, barely posted Weibo or handled his account to Yu Xin.However, what he did not know was how adorable a high-flyer was in people\u2019s eyes these days.In this world, most people were ordinary, doing ordinary jobs and living ordinary lives. However, those high-flyers were not the same, because from an early age, they had revealed many differences, and even their way of thinking was very different from others.People were always interested in the one who was different but stronger than themselves. They would feel like getting a bonus if the standout was particularly handsome.Therefore, as early as the moment Yu Qinghuan\u2019s academic qualifications exposed, it was doomed that he could never keep a low profile as he had expected before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only when Yu Qinghuan arrived did he realized that he was not the only one who came for the audition, but also many newbies who were currently on the rise, and even Fang Zhongxi, who was the second male lead on the same film crew with him.When the two met, they were both surprised.Fang Zhongxi was not Yu Qinghuan\u2019s acquaintance, so he just nodded and said hello and then left with Yu Xin.However, Fang Zhongxi could not be as free and easy as Yu Qinghuan was. Fang was already 26 years old, but he even had no well-known piece and the public\u2019s impression of him was still a young and fresh actor. His company managing to arrange him the second male lead in The Line of Life and Death was to raise his fame and status.But this alone was still not enough, he also needed to be a spokesperson for a famous brand to manifest his popularity.The most famous foreign brands all favored the established or hottest stars. Fang Zhongxi belonged to neither. So Chicly had become his best choice.After all this effort, he finally reached the final stage of the audition. How could he allow any mishap?In every dimension, Yu Qinghuan the newbie was less threatening than other stars. But Fang Zhongxi just felt he was somewhat different. During the filming, Liu Jia\u2019an, Wang Zhensheng and all the predecessors were all very kind to him, almost like they had been enchanted.There were too many variables in Yu Qinghuan, he must not be taken lightly!\u201cGo to Yunxing Promotion Company,\u201d Fang Zhongxi called his assistant and ordered in a low voice, \u201cNo matter what method you use, tie the personal image of Yu Qinghuan with the canned yellow peaches.\u201d After a pause, he added, \u201cTell them that money is not a problem and I want to see the effect immediately.\u201dChicly was an entry lux brand with a faddish and trendy product orientation. Once Yu Qinghuan\u2019s personal image was tied with canned yellow peaches, it would appear less premium. Even if his image and style were appropriate, Chicly would never use him as their brand ambassador.At noon on this day, Yu Qinghuan had just returned to the filming set when he found that information about him and canned yellow peaches was all over the internet. Not only that, people also used his photo and canned food to create various pictures and spread them everywhere.Unexpectedly, the pictures of Yu Qinghuan and canned yellow peaches had a great vogue and even being included in the chat stickers.Huo Rong accidentally opened his Weibo to find such a situation, and immediately knew that someone was deliberately framing Qinghuan. Although netizens were all making fun of him without malice, he knew that Chicly had recently contacted Yu Qinghuan and had the intention choosing him as the ambassador for a trench coat.Now that this had happened, Yu Qinghuan was obviously no longer an option for Chicly.Huo Rong had meant to repress this kind of wide spreading. He thought of his younger brother, who had been cheerful recently, squinted his eye, and sent a message to him,[Hey, your good friend has been bullied miserably and pitifully. Do you think your brother should help him?]After sending it, Huo Rong felt that he was simply too smart! With his little brother\u2019s concerns for Yu Qinghuan, Huo Qu would certainly ask for help from him even if he did not know what was going on, thus Huo Rong could also receive his little brother\u2019s gratitude!He even felt a little excited on thinking about it!When the text message was sent out, Huo Qu was leaving the hotel for the world academic exchange conference.In order not to miss the message from Qinghuan, in recent days, Huo Qu had kept the cell phone with him unprecedentedly. So he knew about Qinghuan the moment he received the message.What? Qinghuan was being bullied miserably?In fact, most of the words in the world were meaningless to Huo Qu, but the word \u201cbully\u201d alone was different, which represented his particularly painful childhood he especially wanted to erase.He was different from normal kids from an early age, he suffered more than other children, from classmates, teachers and even... his family.When Huo Rong was still young, he always felt that his younger brother was too stupid and hated his parents\u2019 partiality. Therefore, he would play tricks on Huo Qu in places where his parents could not see them.As a result, Huo Qu considered himself a monster and lived in great pains for a long time.It was not until Huo Rong grew up that he finally understood his brother's situation and why his parents were so biased. But it was too late. The damage he did to Huo Qu was irreversible. He could only do his best to treat Huo Qu well, hoping to make up for his mistakes.Staring at the message, Huo Qu\u2019s face turned pale and his chest began to ache sharply.He could not let others bully Qinghuan! No one! Yes, he was a real man now, no longer as weak as when he was a child, he could protect himself, and Qinghuan of course!Definitely, he could not bear Qing Huan suffering the same pain!He pressed his lips tightly. In the shocking eyes of others, Huo Qu suddenly turned at his feet, rushing out of the hotel like a wind.\u201cProfessor Huo!\u201d The scientist who came with him was frightened to disgrace and rushed after him, \u201cwhere are you going?\u201d\u201cI want to go back!\u201d Huo Qu kept on walking and spit out those four words firmly.\u201cWhat? My goodness! Professor Huo, wait!\u201d\u201cJesus Christ! Stop Professor Huo!\u201d\u201cCome on! The exchange conference will begin soon!\u201d\u2026The hotel suddenly fell in great confusion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)Translator: Guy Gone BadHuo Qu was extremely anxious and ran with all his potential. He almost flew and disappeared in the blink of an eye.The fellow scientists were almost scared out of their wits!They had heard a lot about this young man these days. It was said that he was a man who could get lost the moment he stepped out of his house. Now he even said he wanted to return home alone!Whether the young man would attend the academic conference or not had become less significant now. It was not worth losing a physics genius with a bright future just for an exchange conference. Besides, they did not want Huo family\u2019s anger and complaints afterwards!What a bad luck!Those grey-haired old men scolded the one sending message to Huo Qu several hundred times in their hearts and were almost worried to lose their last straws of hairs. People from their delegation, even the young girl Cheng Ya, all went out to look for Huo Qu.\u201cUse your flexible legs and feet, Ya. Search all the places near the hotel!\u201dOn the plane, Cheng Ya lost her face all because of Huo Qu, so she had been hard on him these days. However, knowing that this was not the time for willfulness, she took her room card and mobile phone and stormed out.She did not know if she should buy lottery tickets today, because the moment she just walked to the parking lot exit behind the hotel, she had seen Huo Qu. After a long period of mental construction, the little girl finally made up her mind to open her mouth to stop him. However, she saw Huo Qu turn around, and suddenly walked into the parking lot.Cheng Ya: \u201c?\u201dWhat is he doing? Did he find a kind car owner in the underground garage who could take him to the airport?Cheng Ya wondered in her heart, and followed Huo Qu far behind him. Then... she witnessed the scene that totally refreshed her conceptions...There was no kind car owner at all! Huo Qu just turned round and round in the parking lot like a headless fly. Finally he felt exhausted and returned to the exit, and then... he looked around doubtfully and got into the parking lot again.The process repeated for two or three times. Finally, Cheng Ya felt unbearable of standing idle, and she ran over and grabbed him.\u201cStop, don\u2019t you know you\u2019ve already made several rounds in the parking lot?\u201dShe thought it was unbelievable. She always listened to her father at home about how excellent Huo Qu was, how many difficult problems he had solved, and how many truths he had discovered. But such a brilliant brain even could not remember the road?\u201cIs that so?\u201d Huo Qu looked back and stared at the road he had walked by. After a while, he suddenly raised his hand and hit his head hard.Qinghuan being bullied and needed him very much.But he could not even find the way to the airport.After so many years, he was still a useless person, a monster different from everyone else...\u201cHey, don\u2019t do this to yourself!\u201d Cheng Ya got startled by his action. Although still having resentment with him in her heart, she could not get angry seeing this extremely handsome face.\u201cWell, then... Go home with me. My dad and everyone else are looking for you. The conference will begin soon.\u201dGoing back? Huo Qu chewed the two words repeatedly and then shook his head firmly.No! He would not go back!He was going home! To find Qinghuan!\u201cHow could you be so selfish?\u201d Cheng Ya was so furious to stamp her feet, \u201cDo you know how worried my dad and other people are? What are you doing now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to find Qinghuan...\u201d Huo Qu could not listen to her, slouched and kept mumbling, \u201cQing Huan was bullied, I\u2019m going to find him...\u201dCheng Ya keenly grasped the key word from what he was saying, \u201cWho is Qinghuan?\u201d\u201cQinghuan is my best friend.\u201d Huo Qu was especially sensitive to these two words, and he replied without hesitation when he heard this.\u201cBecause he was bullied, you didn\u2019t even want to attend the meeting and wanted to go back?\u201d Cheng Ya felt a trace of something unusual.\u201cYes!\u201dCheng Ya asked again, \u201cIs Qinghuan a pretty girl?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Hearing her words, Huo Qu paused, and then shook his head, \u201cQinghuan is a man.\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dShe just knew it!No one could resist her charm!Unless... that person is gay!\u201cDo you insist on going back?\u201d Believing that she had found out why Huo Qu ignored her, Cheng Ya felt much more comfortable and found Huo Qu more pleasing to the eye, so she asked again.\u201cMmm!\u201d Huo Qu nodded vigorously.\u201cHave you taken your passport and ID card? Have you bought the air ticket? Most importantly, do you know how to get to the airport?\u201dThis series of questions turned Huo Qu\u2019s eyes into question marks. He looked blankly at Cheng Ya and did not understand what she meant.\u201cForget it,\u201d Cheng Ya held her forehead, \u201clet me help you.\u201dAlthough not knowing why, she felt a little bit excited in helping him...After hiding Huo Qu in a corner of the street, Cheng Ya sneaked back to the hotel, picked up Huo Qu\u2019s luggage, bought him a ticket and took him to the airport.\u201cThank you.\u201d Before boarding the plane, Huo Qu thanked Cheng Ya politely and praised her sincerely, \u201cYou are very capable.\u201dHuo Qu admired Cheng Ya for remembering such a difficult procedure for returning home.\u201cHave a safe journey. Go!\u201d She asked a person on the same flight to look after him and pushed Huo Qu impatiently into the boarding gate. Looking at Huo Qu\u2019s tall and straight back drifting away, she could not help but spat, \u201cBah! What's the use of his handsome face!\u201dIt turned out he was not into women!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2)Translator: Guy Gone BadIn the film set, Yu Qinghuan had already put on makeup and sat on one side, waiting for his part, the part he played for his audition.Since the cost of renting the plane was high, the film crew only rented it for three days, during which they had to finish all the scenes that needed the plane, so both Liu Jia\u2019an and the actors felt the great pressure.While Yu Qinghuan was thinking about the next plot in his heart, Zhao Qingyuan sneaked to his side fromnowhere. He took Yu Qinghuan by the shoulder, tugged at his arm hard, with a disgusting smile, \u201cAre you nervous about acting with me later?\u201dAfter the picture in his mind interrupted, Yu Qinghuan glanced at him casually, \u201cWhy should I be nervous?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan was unwilling to believe it, he walked around to the front, staring at his eyes, \u201cYou don\u2019t feel nervous acting with such a person like me? You must be lying!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person are you?\u201d Yu Qinghuan asked, \u201cWho chatted with my automatic reply all afternoon? Or someone who cannot get up after eating my canned yellow peaches?\u201dYu Qinghuan\u2019s voice was like freezing spring water, cold and clear, and usually sounded pleasant. However, his voice could be especially ironic when he said something sarcastically.Zhao Qingyuan choked on his words, suddenly stood up and looked at Yu Qinghuan condescendingly, \u201cJust wait! I will not go easy on you!\u201dIn the film studio, several cameras were set. Liu Jia\u2019an gestured to the actors to take their places, and he could not wait to say, \u201cAction!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going! Anyone else but not me!\u201d Yu Qinghuan adjusted his mood in an instant. The veins stood out on his forehead and his handsome face twisted. Despite the obstruction of the flight attendants, he rushed at the hatch with all his strength, \u201cBack off! Get out of my way! I want to go back! Let me out!\u201d\u201cStop!\u201d Peng Cheng, played by Zhao Qingyuan, came hurrying forward, grabbed his arm and dragged him backwards. \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass our hospital here! When you get to the battlefield, you can go wherever you like. Nobody cares!\u201d\u201cBullshit!\u201d Ye Sheng looked back at him maliciously, \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know? I could never go back if I fucking go there! I\u2026\u201d\u201cCut!\u201d At this time, Liu Jia\u2019an suddenly told them to stop.He stared at the frames in the camera and frowned, \u201cQing Huan\u2019s mood was a bit wrong. Adjust it and start it over.\u201d\u201cOkay, Director Liu.\u201d Yu Qinghuan apologized and took the water from Yu Xin. He drank it while thinking about what went wrong.\u201cI think you played quite well,\u201d Zhao Qingyuan was a little confused. He squatted beside Yu Qinghuan, recalling the scene just now, and said so.In fact, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s acting skills startled him. If it were not for the familiar face, he even thought he was facing a rival of the same competence rather than a newbie.Why was Liu Jia\u2019an still unsatisfied?Liu Jia\u2019an came over when he was still pondering, \u201cQinghuan should be more intense in his mood,\u201d he paused and looked at Zhao Qingyuan, \u201cYou are the same, the atmosphere of the acting of you two was tense, but I want to see you two confront each other with daggers.\u201dThe two men nodded to digest Liu Jia\u2019an\u2019s meaning, and then they rehearsed it again in private. Only then did they signal Liu Jia\u2019an that they could start over.Unfortunately, this time their performance still failed.\u201cWhat the hell was going on?\u201d Zhao Qingyuan was somewhat anxious and grabbed his hair.He and Qinghuan both played very well and could not see any flaw in the camera. Was Liu Jia\u2019an deliberately messing with them? But no director would make fun of this.Yu Qinghuan could not answer his question either. He pondered for a long time and did not know what was wrong with him. Finally, he even went to consult Wang Zhensheng.However, Wang Zhensheng only answered, \u201cLike Director Liu, I also felt something wrong, but I can\u2019t tell where. You need to figure it out yourself.\u201dYu Qinghuan and Zhao Qingyuan tried to figure it out while they were filming. They repeated it a dozen times. At last, Yu Qinghuan was numb to hearing \"NG\", but they still did not meet the requirements of Liu Jia\u2019an.They filmed all afternoon. Yu Qinghuan looked exhausted and cold. His whole person looked very tired and his eyes were bloodshot. Not only that, because of the continuous emotional outburst, his voice already hoarse. Yu Xin felt distressed and made him a cup of throat-moistening tea.\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Yu Qinghuan breathed a sigh of relief, only spoke one sentence to Yu Xin, and then fell back into thinking.Liu Jia\u2019an had always said that his emotions were not intense enough, but he felt that he had already shown enough. Was it necessary to be more exaggerated? No, it was not\u2026Yu Qinghuan then changed his way of thinking. He thought that the reason why Ye Sheng had a conflict with Peng Cheng was that he did not want to go to the battlefield, while the reason behind it was\u2026Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes suddenly beamed with light! He got it! Ye Sheng was afraid of death!What he was excepted to show was Ye Sheng\u2019s fear of death!No wonder Liu Jia\u2019an always said his mood was wrong!Fearing that this inspiration would pass away, Yu Qinghuan quickly took the initiative to find Liu Jia\u2019an.Sure enough, Liu Jia\u2019an did not stop this time, and his performance finally passed.Yu Qinghuan finally felt relieved and took the down jacket from Yu Xin and put it on. When he was just about to ask Zhao Qingyuan if he would return with him to have a rest, he heard the other party talking on the phone, \u201cMom? Why are you calling me so late? Me? I\u2019m filming. Of course I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ll go back to rest right away. No, do not come. I\u2019m losing weight. I can\u2019t eat anything you send to me...\u201dZhao Qingyuan was garrulous, mincing and capricious, which was the exclusive right of the children who watered by love.Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes gradually dimmed. He took a deep breath and turned to Yu Xin. \u201cDude, let\u2019s go home.\"Yu Xin saw that his face was not quite right, and finally he did not refrain from asking him, \u201cQinghuan, are you angry with Director Liu? Hey, why did you suddenly become narrow-minded? Don\u2019t be angry, just show yourself well next time.\u201dYu Qinghuan let out an \u201cEmm\u201d, and withdrew his uncontrollably envious eyes casting on Zhao Qingyuan.The author has something to say:Huo Qu: Let me go! I want to return home to help Qinghuan!Cheng Ya: I bet you cannot even walk out of the parking lot, huh...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)Translator: Guy Gone BadNot long after Yu Qinghuan came back to his room, Zhao Qingyuan came knocking at his door, and then walked in with a big insulation pail in his hands.He then sat his butt on the bed and questioned Yu Qinghuan, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wait for me?\u201dBest actor winner Zhao felt a little upset since his pal didn\u2019t wait for him.Yu Qinghuan glanced at him blandly, \u201cAre you a kid and need company when you go to the bathroom or go home?\u201dZhao Qingyuan had already been used to his sarcasm and his mental endurance had already advanced to another level. This time he didn\u2019t stamp on his feet. Instead, he opened that insulation pail and looked at Yu Qinghuan proudly, \u201cMy mom just sent me this. So, dude, I specially take it here to share with you.\u201d\u201cYou just want someone to flesh up with you.\u201d Yu Qinghuan knew Zhao Qingyuan to his ass, so he immediately saw him through.Zhao Qingyuan forced a smile and admitted, \u201cYou got me.\u201dIt had everything inside, rice, delicate dishes and soup. One could tell his mom really put her heart into it.Zhao Qingyuan then slipped a spoon into Yu Qinghuan\u2019s hand, \u201cCome on! Eat while it\u2019s hot!\u201dAfter a pause, when Yu Qinghuan was going to eat, he suddenly stopped him, \u201cWait! Let me take a photo first,\u201d After adjusting the angle, click, click, click, he took three burst shots. While adding filters to the photos, he exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m gonna bomb the Weibo!\u201dAfter saying it, he suddenly made a pause. After a few seconds\u2019 silence, he threw his phone on the bed and lowered his voice, \u201cForget it. It\u2019s no fun. Eat, eat!\u201dHe then stuffed the food into his mouth like nothing happened.Yu Qinghuan knew what he minded. He didn\u2019t want this sonsy dumbass to keep clouded, so he walked forward, picked up the phone and handed it to him, \u201cPost it! I will repost.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s eyes were shining. He looked at Yu Qinghuan expectantly, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me!\u201d\u201cI promise.\u201dIt was completely different kind of feeling between him sending it alone and a good friend asking him to post it and promising to repost. Besides, this friend was rather bland. To have him repost his Weibo was an extremely rare chance!Being afraid Yu Qinghuan might go back on his words, Zhao Qingyuan snatched the phone and immediately posted a Weibo, with just a few words!Zhao Qingyuan: Enjoy the cuisine with my friend Qinghuan tonight! [DOD\u2019S HEAD][PHOTOS]After he posted it, he immediately moved his ass to Yu Qinghuan\u2019s side, \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201dUnder his gaze, Yu Qinghuan opened his Weibo account and reposted it.Yu Qinghuan: Hm. //@ Zhao Qingyuan: Enjoy the cuisine with my friend Qinghuan tonight! [DOD\u2019S HEAD][PHOTOS]Zhao Qingyuan hadn\u2019t updated his Weibo for a few days. His fans already couldn\u2019t wait any longer. And now their idol finally posted a Weibo, and even interacted with Yu Qinghuan! They all left comments under his Weibo like they were high![Wow! Wow! Wow! Our Yuan is back! What a hearty dinner! Drooling! \uff08\u02c9\ufe43\u02c9\uff09][How outraging! I really can\u2019t hold it and ordered takeout!][Wait\u2026Is there something wrong with my eyes or what\u2026I saw kind of doting from Qinghuan\u2019s repost!][You are not alone! My heart is melting!][So adorable!]\u2026Zhao Qingyuan ignored those comments. Instead, he stared at Yu Qinghuan\u2019s repost and said unhappily, \u201cCome on, Qinghuan. Can\u2019t you just post more words? Delete it and do it again! Hurry!\u201dYu Qinghuan then threw his phone on the table and said, \u201cAre you eating or not?\u201d\u201cSure, sure, sure.\u201d Overwhelmed by his momentum, Zhao Qingyuan became much well-behaved. He pushed a bowl of soup before Yu Qinghuan and said complacently, \u201cTry the soup. My mom is really good at this!\u201dYu Qinghuan scooped a spoonful and said, \u201cHm.\u201d\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d after watching him eat the soup, Zhao Qingyuan instantly leaned closer and asked, \u201cIs it delicious?\u201d\u201cHm,\u201d Yu Qinghuan held up the bowl and ate half of it at one go, \u201cQuite tasty.\u201dPity that his friend would never know his mother was also pretty good at cooking soup.\u201cAll right. Then eat some more if you like it.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan didn\u2019t expect he liked it so much. So he pushed his bowl before Yu Qinghuan.Yu Qinghuan accepted his kindness delightfully.Zhao Qingyuan felt that Yu Qinghuan became a little weird after he ate the soup.But he is still that Yu Qinghuan, short-spoken, eating like a horse.Under such weird atmosphere, Zhao Qingyuan immediately slipped away after finishing the dinner together, even having no time for the insulation pail.Yu Qinghuan heaved a sigh. When he was about to clear up the mess Qinghuan left, he received the call from the contact person of Chicly.That person kept apologizing, saying that they had already chosen the spokesman of their dust coat, neither him nor Fang Zhongxi, but a newcomer from another entertainment company, and thanked him for the audition, etc..He was not chosen! He was so goddamn lucky!Until the other side hung up, Yu Qinghuan still didn\u2019t come to his sense. After quite a few minutes, he became sure that this was real and then hung up his phone smilingly.Recently he had been freaked out by his creepy good luck. But seen from now, maybe Chicly was a good start. The good luck the rebirth had brought to him was fading away, and he could finally live a low profile life as he had always wanted.The more Yu Qinghuan thought about it, the more happier. When Yu Xin came to asked him about the call, Yu Qinghuan tried all he could to hold his laugh, making his face look weirdly blushing, which made Yu Xin think he was being upset for not being chosen and prepared to comfort him.\u201cIt is their loss not to choose you!\u201d In Yu Xin\u2019s eyes, no one was better that his Yu Qinghuan, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m gonna get you a fancier endorsement than Chicly!\u201d\u201cThank you, bro.\u201dActually Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t take his words into his heart at all.In his mind, with his good luck, even Chicly wouldn\u2019t lay their eyes on him, let alone other brands of higher level. So he might let Yu Xin down.On thinking of that, Yu Qinghuan glanced at Yu Xin with regrets.But Yu Xin thought Yu Qinghuan looked at him with regrets for causing trouble for him, so he felt more motivated! With such a considerate actor, he would definitely get him an endorsement no matter what. He would face slap Chicly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2)Translator: Guy Gone BadWhile they were still mistaking each other, the internet had already been exploded.The reason was that the variety show of the national station-Young People Want High.The first episode was a huge success, both funny and touching, and also educational. Besides, it had been quite a long time before the second episode, which everyone was looking forward to.On that day, numerous people abandoned their computers and waited before the televisions to contribute for the ratings of this variety show.But they all had one question at the end of this episode--Ah!!! Who are the two handsome guys they interviewed at last?One is handsome, while the other is cute! One is charming, while the other is bland! Aren\u2019t they a perfect match![Ah!! Please! Any insider who could tell us who they are! I have rooted for this couple! See? My hands are out of my control and start to draw BL comics! [PICTURE]]\u201cOh my! I\u2019m dead!

Straighten up your ears! Let me tell you. He is called Huo Qu, employed in Institute for Advanced Study of Hua Univ.. His title is professor! Open your two holes! Professor\u2014the youngest professor of our country! So many foreign elite universities fought for him in those years! Gee! What a shuraba!][Oh, right, I nearly forgot to tell you. Don\u2019t you think Qinghuan looks quite familiar? He is that uniform boy of the Department of Journalism of Hua Univ.. Young man, here is a piece of my advice. Less Weibo, more books!

But when they searched Huo Qu out of curiosity, they all dropped their jaws\u2014it\u2019s all true![I read materials about Huo Qu with my knees down\u2026][I thought Qinghuan would be the upper limit. I never expected Huo Qu breaks it! My knees\u2026][I found that all talents are the same\u2026I had a classmate who went to Dongda Medical College.

Those girls came up with a very down-to-earth name for this CP: \u201cMODEL CP OF HUA UNIV.\u201d which immediately pulled this pair of smart asses from the altar!While those girls were digging anything fishy about those two, someone who only had dozens of followers on Weibo suddenly updated--[Coordinate: America.

But I never knew he\u2026[PICTURE]]What the hell\u2026This was like handing over a pillow to someone who was dead sleepy!

But since he went to the Grand Theater last time, he had developed a habit of observing how others acted.Liu Jia\u2019an felt a little surprised at first. A young man in his early twenties should play video games or sleep in the hotel till the sunset when he didn\u2019t shoot. No one would be so self-disciplined.But after Yu Qinghuan had kept doing so for some time no matter what, Liu Jia\u2019an gradually got used to it.One day, on seeing Yu Qinghuan, he took off the cigar in his mouth and said hello to Qinghuan with a smile, \u201cYou are early Qinghuan.\u201d\u201cMorning, director.\u201d Yu Qinghuan sat next to Liu Jia\u2019an and watched the monitor together with him.Liu Jia\u2019an sighed with emotion, \u201cYour life style is completely different from other young men.Yu Qinghuan chuckled, didn\u2019t say a word.\u201cI found it\u2019s really reasonable to hire you,\u201d said Liu Jia\u2019an suddenly. Looking at Yu Qinghuan\u2019s stunned expression, he explained with a smile, \u201cI thought you are just a diligent newcomer, and with a very reasonable price. I didn\u2019t expect you are quite appropriate for this occupation. Let\u2019s put aside your acting skills aside, even your hot search ability has saved me a lot of publicity expenses.\u201dLiu Jia\u2019an had a habit\u2014he would see every program presented by the national station.Although people had been badmouthing the national station these years, like the hosts job-hoppinh together, programs becoming more and more boring, Liu Jia\u2019an still gave his support and turned up his nose at those comments.Most programs of the national station belonged to serious content. They seldom launched entertainment programs. But every time they launched an entertainment program, it would be a classic one.Let\u2019s put aside those grand and exquisite documentaries. The new Young People Want High, whether its conception or the content, they were both outstanding, beating other rotten variety shows to the ground.They interpreted what was \u201cyour dad is still your dad.\u201d with what they could do, no matter how many years had passed.Last night, Liu Jia\u2019an put off all his work and waited for the second episode of Young People Want High before the television. He never expected he would see Yu Qinghuan in the interview.To show up in such a hot show, even as a passer-by, it was already very rare, let alone Yu Qinghuan and Huo Qu had contributed so many blisters.\u201cWhat hot search ability?\u201d Yu Qinghuan had already left the interview in the street behind. And now hearing Liu Jia\u2019an words, he was completely at a loss.\u201cOh!\u201d Liu Jia\u2019an took out his phone, \u201cDon\u2019t you know? You and Huo Qu made a hit on Weibo yesterday.\u201dWhat? After Yu Qinghuan leaned forward to see what was going on, he nearly blacked out.How could it be? Hadn\u2019t his good luck been gradually gone? Even if this show was hot, they only showed up for a few seconds as passers-by, how would so many people were gossiping about them?Wait? That person said she met Huo Qu at the airport of America?Yu Qinghuan zoomed in the photo on Weibo and confirmed it was Huo Qu.But it ain\u2019t no right. Huo Qu said he\u2019d stay there for a week. Something happened? And seen from the photo, Huo Qu was all alone, no one around.On thinking that Huo Qu went to the airport himself, Yu Qinghuan nearly had a heart attack.He immediately asked Liu Jia\u2019an to contact Huo Rong and inquired about the situation.Liu Jia\u2019an knew about Yu Qinghuan, plus he had seen him and Huo Qu together in the show, so he didn\u2019t suspect their relationship at all and immediately dialed Huo Rong\u2019s number.At this time, Huo family had already fallen into a panic. Huo Rong with a bristly unshaven chin was sitting on the couch, with red eyes, saying with a hoarse voice, \u201cI was just joking, brother. I never expected he would really fly back alone.\u201dHuo Rong felt like stung by remorse. He\u2019d wish that someone could give him a stab. If something bad happened to his little brother, he would never forgive himself.Huo Rong gave Huo Rong dagger eyes, \u201cFor all these years, I thought you have grown up.\u201d\u201cBrother!\u201d Huo Rong threw a punch on the tea table, saying with a trembling voice, \u201cI said I didn\u2019t mean it. How old am I? How could I ever play tricks on him\u2026\u201d\u201cYou better be.\u201d Huo Zheng took his eyes back from him, \u201cAdjust your expression. Pretend everything is as normal, or dad and mom will know. Now bring some people to the airport now.\u201dAlthough something went wrong at his little brother\u2019s side, things hadn\u2019t gone to the worst step. At least he correctly boarded on the right flight. So they should not blame Cheng Ya, instead, they should thank her.Otherwise for his little brother\u2019s stubborn characters, who knows where he is gonna send himself to?\u201cI\u2019ll go now.\u201d When Huo Rong was about to leave, his mobile phone rang.Hearing it was Yu Qinghuan, he didn\u2019t hide any detail from him, but told him everything while driving.On the second floor, hearing the loud engine sound of her son\u2019s sports car, Mrs. Huo wept in bed, looking very sad.They were all her flesh. How would she not notice something happened? Those kids didn\u2019t want to worry her, so she could only pretend that she knew nothing.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d Her husband moved to her and wept her tears for her with his rough hands, but his voice was gentle, \u201cYou are going to be a granny, how could you cry for such a small thing? Qu will be all right. Didn\u2019t they say he has already boarded? Are you afraid that he may get lost on the plane?\u201d\u201cBah! Bah! Bah!\u201d Mrs. Huo gave him a resentful expression, \u201cYou are lost! Are you even his father?\u201d Now she got angrier and raised her voice, \u201cYou promised those old men could take care of him, so I didn\u2019t let the bodyguards go with him. Otherwise, how would this happen?\u201dLooking at his furious and misbehaving wife, Mr. Huo heaved a sigh, \u201cMiao, Qu is nearly thirty years old. You can not always take him as a kid. He is much better than before. Now he has someone he cares about and is willing to connect to the outside world. You can\u2019t always put an eye on him. Have you ever thought about this? If things keep going on like this, what if we get old someday?\u201dActually Mrs. Huo was already convinced by her husband, but she still wouldn\u2019t admit it, \u201cSo what? He has two elder brothers.\u201d\u201cBut Huo Zheng and Huo Rong will get married some day and have their own wives and kids. How could they put all their attention on Qu like us?\u201dMrs. Huo pursed her lips, but didn\u2019t talk back.\u201cAll right,\u201d Mr. Huo patted her back and comforted her, \u201cPretend we know nothing. Leave it to those kids. Didn\u2019t you say it\u2019s a little cold recently? I\u2019ll check out some warm countries. Then you pick one and only you and me\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s almost arrived.\u201d No time for small talk, Yu Qinghuan looked at the people behind Huo Rong and came straight to the point, \u201cHe should come out at Exit A. You have more people. You can split out, so you wouldn\u2019t miss him.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d Huo Rong approved and did as he suggested.\u201cWait,\u201d After taking a few breaths, Yu Qinghuan continued, \u201cLet\u2019s exchange our numbers. If you see him, you can tell me in the first place, vice versa.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dAfter everything was arranged, the only thing they needed to do was waiting for Huo Qu.Yu Qinghuan waited before the arrival hall, scanning the crowd without blinking, feeling very awful.He had never expected that Huo Qu would do this for him.He even didn\u2019t know how to cross the road, but immediately came back from abroad, even gave up the academic exchange conference on hearing Yu Qinghuan got bullied.What was he thinking at that very moment? Didn\u2019t he feel frightened when he thought of the scene he\u2019d wait at the airport alone helplessly?How did he overcome such instinct fear for such a friend he hadn\u2019t known for long?Yu Qinghuan could get no answer of any of these questions.He knew that, whether to the fellow scientists or to his family, this was a big trouble, but he didn\u2019t know why he felt very happy deep in his heart.He had never had the feeling of being valued and cared about by someone for no reason since his parents died.Yu Qinghuan felt sore in his eyes. He thought he had to do something for Huo Qu. It was never one side\u2019s giving between friends. He couldn\u2019t just take Huo Qu\u2019s selfless giving for granted.After breathing upon his hands to keep warm, he raised his head and suddenly pinned his eyes at somewhere--Among the crowd pressed for time on their journey, Huo Qu, straightened up like a poplar, looked extra conspicuous. He pursed his lips, with that notebook in his hand. It seemed he raised his hand trying to look at his notebook, but got humped against from behind suddenly and the notebook immediately fell on the ground.Before he had time to pick it up, those passers-by already stepped on it.He stared at the ground, looking his head, like a little fawn accidentally breaking in a big city.Yu Qinghuan felt pains in his chest. Before his brain giving him an order, his body already rushed to him, \u201cHuo Qu!\u201d\u201d\u201dOn hearing the familiar voice, Huo Qu\u2019s eyes shone, and then he pinned his eyes on Yu Qinghuan, \u201cQinghuan, it\u2019s you!\u201d\u201cWhy do you come back in such a hurry?\u201d Knowing it was because of him, Yu Qinghuan still wouldn\u2019t admit it, \u201cYou know how much trouble have caused to others? What about the academic exchange conference? How could you miss such an important conference for no reason?\u201dSeeing Huo Qu nearly buried his head in his chest because of shame, Yu Qinghuan felt that he finally let out the complicated feeling he had suppressed.Great! This person came back in a whole piece.\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Huo Qu looked at him cravenly, \u201cYou\u2026are you mad at me?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m mad at you! Have you ever considered the consequences? Huo Qu, you are an adult, not a kid anymore. You should have the sense of responsibility.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dHuo Qu pulled a corner of his clothes restlessly, \u201cExcept me, there are other representatives on behalf of our country.\u201dYu Qinghuan took a deep breath, and immediately understood what he was trying to say.Without Huo Qu, others could replace him to attend the academic conference. But no one was with Qinghuan except him.Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t say a word, which made Huo Qu more nervous. He peeped at him now and then and suddenly stretched out his hands and held him in his arms.\u201cQinghuan, I\u2026I am wrong. Don\u2019t be mad at me.\u201d After a pause, Huo Qu buried his head in Qinghuan\u2019s neck and explained why he came back with a resolute tone, \u201cQinghuan, don\u2019t be afraid. I am back now. I will kick the ass of the guy who bullied you.\u201dHuo Qu was a bit higher than Qinghuan. So now he was trying to hold the whole Yu Qinghuan into his arms unhandily, which made him like a hen stretching out the wings to protect the chicken, very funny.But Yu Qinghuan was not in the mood to laugh. He felt both sad and annoyed and nearly couldn\u2019t restrain himself. Finally he tried to calm himself down a bit. When he opened his mouth and was about to say something, he suddenly felt his clavicle wet with cool liquid flowing down his chest.\u201cWhy are you crying? Now you are afraid that you got into trouble?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why are you crying?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.

Only Huo Qu\u2019s words, \u201cI just\u2026feel upset on thinking you feel the same way\u201d kept circulating in his mind.He always thought that Huo Qu\u2019s empathy was missing so that he could not feel the emotion of ordinary people.But at this moment, Yu Qinghuan realized that Huo Qu knew everything in his heart, he just had no chance to express it.Yu Qinghuan remembered that the last time someone cared about him this way was more than ten years ago. The broker in his previous life was a mutually beneficial relationship with him, only caring about his commercial value. While most of those so-called friends only wanted to get something from him.As for his emotions and feelings, no one cared at all.What Huo Qu said was like a warm current rushing in an upsurge, having melted the ice in Yu Qinghuan\u2019s heart in an instant. His heart seemed to be soaked in warm water, which was extremely comfortable.Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes turned red, then he patted Huo Qu on the back. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not upset, shall we go back first? Your brother is still waiting for you.\u201dHe thought the best thing he had ever done in this life was to pick up the lost Huo Qu by the roadside.Huo Qu took a sniff and raised his head from the side of Yu Qinghuan\u2019s neck. His long thick eyelashes were wet and clustered with tears and looked somehow pitiful.\u201cDon\u2019t you feel embarrassed?\u201d Yu Qinghuan chuckled, deliberately stretched out two fingers, trying to catch Huo Qu\u2019s eyelashes. Unexpectedly Huo Qu did not even blink his eyes to let him succeed.Everyone had instinctive reactions, especially the eyes, which would instinctively dodge when threatened by external forces. However, Huo Qu did not. It could only be done through complete trust and unsuspecting.Yu Qinghuan\u2019s fingertips were stained with wet tears from Huo Qu. When the wind blew, the soaked part was extremely cold and unforgettable.Yu Qinghuan took a deep breath, suppressed the sour feeling, and then sent a message to Huo Rong, telling him that his brother had been found.\u201cLet\u2019s go, your brother is worried.\u201dHuo Qu nodded and followed him obediently.Yu Qinghuanscolded Huo Qu as he walked, \u201cWhat are you going to do next?\u201d He was afraid that he may not understand him, and added, \u201cIs it really okay not to attend the academic exchange conference? Do you need to inform your superior?\u201dHuo Qu hurriedly shook his head, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201dYu Qinghuan continued, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say earlier it was important?\u201d\u201cBut not as important as you,\u201d Huo Qu blurted out.It was an absolute truth that Yu Qinghuan had a sexual orientation for men. Now what Huo Qu said with a show of seriousness was stirring his heart. He could not help palpitating when looking at Huo Qu\u2019s handsome face.He said in his heart three times of \u201cRabbits don\u2019t eat grass beside their nests\u201d to barely restrain his heartthrob.The two had just walked to the door of gate 4 when Huo Rong came running with a face of surprise. When he saw Huo Qu, his whole body was relieved, \u201cMy dear brother, promise me, don\u2019t frighten me like this next time, ok? Our eldest brother almost skinned me!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Huo Qu apologized in a sincere tone, \u201cI was wrong.\u201dHuo Rong was stunned when he heard these words.This was the first time in more than 20 years that he had seen his younger brother apologize.Huo Qu was very simple, but it was because of this kind of simplicity that he insisted on his own ideas all the more. He would never feel himself wrong. Even if his family took turns to persuade him, he would not change his ideas.Facing their earnest efforts, he would only stay silent and refuse to communicate.Today\u2019s apology was a leap forward for Huo Qu.\u201cNo, it\u2026I mean\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d His silly brother Huo Rong was so happy and was almost to float up. Before their reunion, he planned to complain in front of his parents, but now, even if Huo Qu said he would resign from the institute, he would support him with both hands up, let alone the dropout from the academic exchange conference!He ran up to Huo Qu, with a silly smile, \u201cCome on, go home with me.\u201dHowever, he did not expect Huo Qu to take a step back and stand behind Yu Qinghuan, staring at him warily, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cOr do you want to go back to America?\u201d Huo Rong could not understand what his little brother meant. He grabbed the hair, under kind of distress, \u201cDon\u2019t, little brother, anyway, that kind of conference would be held every year. Rest assured, I will help you handle with the institute. How could you endure the tiring round trips?\u201dHaving said that, he reached out his hands for Huo Qu, but was dodged by the opposite side.Huo Rong\u2019s face was full of doubts, \u201cQu?\u201dHuo Qu looked firm. \u201cI want to go back with Qinghuan.\u201dYu Qinghuan did not expect he would suddenly say so and was startled. After returning to absolute being, he was in some distress situation, \u201cYou should go home first. I\u2019ll come to see you when I\u2019m free. I live with the film crew now, and you can\u2019t go there.\u201dHuo Qu shook his head, uttered the same word, \u201cNo.\u201dHe wanted to be with Qinghuan.\u201cListen to me,\u201d Yu Qinghuan patted him on the shoulder, \u201cGo home with your brother, I need to go back to work soon. Call you later.\u201d\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Huo Qu took hold of Yu Qinghuan\u2019s skirt and looked at him with sparkling eyes, which looked pathetic.Before Yu Qinghuan could say anything, Huo Rong surrendered first.\u201cOK, fine. Take him away. I\u2019ll tell Liu Jia\u2019an.\u201d Huo Rong could not bear to be tough on his little brother and was also worrying him to set the world on another fire. So he just put the duty on Yu Qinghuan, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he would agree.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Since Huo Rong said so, Yu Qinghuan could no longer refuse, but nodded in agreement.Huo Rong saw his little brother\u2019s little face immediately lit up as bright as the sun.Unaccountably, Huo Rong\u2019s heart suddenly filled with a strange sadness like marrying out a sister...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he always felt something was wrong because he was just a newcomer in the circle. Which paparazzi would take pictures of him, just because of eating too much?He carefully looked around and found no suspicious characters, but the feeling of being peeked was still there.Yu Qinghuan could not help but poke Huo Qu with his elbow. \u201cHave you noticed anyone is watching us?\u201dAs long as he was with Yu Qinghuan, other people or things in the outside world did not exist to Huo Qu. He shook his head in bewilderment.Yu Qinghuan held his forehead, regretted having asked him. Just as he was about to pull Huo Qu to run away, a timid voice suddenly sounded behind him, \u201cExcuse me... Are you\u2026Qinghuan and Huo Qu?\u201dYu Qinghuan froze, and then turned around and nodded, \u201cYes,\u201d he glanced at the girls in front of him, \u201cExcuse me...you are?\u201d\u201cAh! What a luck!\u201d The leading girl\u2019s face was filled with joy, and her meaningful eyes swept over Yu Qinghuan and Huo Qu, making Qinghuan feel creepy.\u201cWe are your fans.\u201d Just when Yu Qinghuan could not help retreating, the girl finally opened her mouth, \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you at the airport since the early morning.\u201d\u201cThank you, but don\u2019t do this next time.\u201d Yu Qing Huan had always been kind and considerate to his fans especially when he saw the girl\u2019s thin figure.\u201cQinghuan, you\u2019re so sweet,\u201d the girl looked at Yu Qinghuan with stars in her eyes. \u201cWork hard, both of you, and we will support you!\u201dWhat did she mean? It\u2019s okay to let him work hard. But why was Huo Qu counted? Before Yu Qinghuan could come up with an explanation, Huo Qu, who was standing behind him, suddenly stepped forward and stood in front of him, his face full of displeasure.Yu Qinghuan, \u201c?\u201d What was this all about?\u201cAh!\u201d The girls flushed with excitement and screamed on and on. Under Yu Qinghuan\u2019s puzzled eyes, they directly stuffed a small notebook into Huo Qu\u2019s arms, \u201cIt\u2019s for you! May you live happily all your lives!\u201dThen they turned and ran away.Yu Qinghuan, \u201c...\u201dWell, he finally understood the identities of these girls. They turned out to be fans rooting for the two to get together.He had seen the capacity of this kind of fans in his previous life and worried about they would write something strange in the notebook. So he hurriedly grabbed the notebook and turned over several pages. Fortunately, these girls were not so out of line, there were only the cartoons of him and Huo Qu, and nothing strange.After returning the notebook to Huo Qu, Yu Qinghuan asked, \u201cWhat happened to you just now?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want them to look at you.\u201d Huo Qu replied very honestly.Huo Qu also did not know what was wrong with himself. Last time he felt unhappy because of Zhao Qingyuan, this time because of these girls. As long as they were slightly too close to Qinghuan, he would feel very uncomfortable.Of course, he knew that the word parrot describing Zhao Qingyuan was not good. But how could he rob the Lamian noodles that Yu Qinghuan specially made for him that day? So he interrupted his second brother and deliberately said Zhao Qingyuan was a parrot.Although he knew all the reasons in his heart, he just could not control himself.\u201cNot that serious.\u201d Yu Qinghuan did not take his words seriously and thought it was just the possessiveness desire among friends. He laughed, \u201cSince when have you become so stingy?\u201dHuo Qu\u2019s eyelashes quivered, his head bowed and he said nothing.After Yu Qinghuan returned to the film site with Huo Qu, Liu Jia\u2019an said nothing. It seemed Huo Rong had informed him in advance already.But the accommodation posed another problem due to Huo Qu\u2019s arrival. The hotel rooms rented by the film crew were fully occupied. Yu Qinghuan was not at ease to let Huo Qu stay in other hotels. Finally, he could only let Huo Qu sleep in his room.\u201cI\u2019ll take a shower first, your clothes for changing are here,\u201d Yu Qinghuan pointed to the cabinet beside, \u201cTake them out later. Your turn is after me.\u201dHuo Qu obediently nodded his head, found out his clothes, and put them away properly. Glancing at the hand-painted notebook on the bed head, he could not help opening it.With just a glance, he was shocked.The book was full of cartoons of him and Qinghuan! Eating, reading books, and even watching movies together!The little figures in the cartoon had his and Qinghuan\u2019s names on the heads, which was adorable! The more he read it, the more he liked it. Then he turned to the last page and his face turned red in an instant.There was a cartoon of him and Qing Huan kissing. It was so lifelike that even his blushes were drawn!How\u2026 How could it even be possible?Huo Qu threw away the notebook in panic and almost fell off the bed.How could he and\u2026Qinghuan kiss? They were not husband and wife!However, even Huo Qu himself did not know why, the picture had been engraved in his mind, and could not be driven away.When Yu Qinghuan came out of the shower, he noticed that Huo Qu flushed with his whole person looking like a flaming shrimp. He immediately got a fright. \u201cAre you all right? Feeling sick?\u201d\u201cI, I\u2019ll go take a bath!\u201d Seeing Yu Qinghuan, Huoqu\u2019s whole body was going to smoke. For the first time, he did not dare to look directly into Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes. He quickly ran into the bathroom.What happened to this guy? Got his head bumped?Yu Qinghuan was puzzled. He withdrew his eyes from Huo Qu and quickly made the bed. Just now Huo Rong sent him a message saying that Huo Qu must go to bed at 9 o\u2019clock in the evening, not a minute earlier or a second late.Maybe it was because of the new environment, Huo Qu\u2019s behavior tonight was very abnormal. The man who should have slept at 9 o\u2019clock could not fall asleep and rolled over in bed like a spinning top, his noise made Yu Qinghuan also agitated. So he could not help kicking him and yelled, \u201cStop it, sleep!\u201dHuo Qu, the man being cautioned was shocked and curled up into a ball pitifully. Although he was not feeling well, he did not dare to move anymore.Yu Qinghuan felt a lot of peace in his ears, but Huo Qu suffered even more. His whole body seemed to be on fire. He was almost burning, and his throat was dry and itchy. Even if he kept swallowing saliva, he could not relieve that kind of thirst.The cartoons of their kissing kept enlarging in his mind. It was like a deadly poppy attracting him, making him could not escape.After a long time, long enough to make Huo Qu feel that it was longer than he had worked out the mechanism of how subatomic particles obtain quality, he finally could not help but quietly got up and called Qinghuan\u2019s name in a whisper, \u201cQinghuan?\u201dYu Qinghuan seemed to be asleep and did not respond.Huo Qu bit his lip and lowered his head slowly.Just one kiss, thought he. He just wanted to give it a try out of curiosity...Just as his lips were about to fall, Yu Qinghuan suddenly opened his eyes in the darkness, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Especially when he looked into Yu Qinghuan\u2019s beautiful eyes, he felt like he could barely breathe.\u201cI\u2026\u201d He opened his mouth but couldn\u2019t speak a complete sentence.Yu Qinghuan hadn\u2019t taken it seriously actually. But now since Huo Qu\u2019s face turned all red, and he nearly could not breathe, Yu Qinghuan was a little worried. So he threw the quilt aside and leaned forward to check him out.But what he never expected was the moment his feet touched the ground, Huo Qu suddenly popped his eyes out and took to his heels after a split second.\u201cHuo Qu!\u201d Yu Qinghuan was anxious. He then chased out without even putting on his flippers, \u201cStay where you are!\u201dOn hearing Yu Qinghuan, Huo Qu hesitated for a few seconds, but deep in his heart he was still shouting \u201cI wanna get out of here\u201d. But at last he stopped anyway, with his head slightly lowered, eyelashes trembling. He dare not look at Yu Qinghuan at all.\u201cFeeling uncomfortable?\u201d Yu Qinghuan raised his hand. The moment he touched Huo Qu\u2019s forehead, Huo Qu immediately trembled drastically, and breathing even heavier than before.\u201cThis ain\u2019t no right.\u201d Yu Qinghuan made up his mind and pulled Huo Qu to the bedside, then picked up a coat and put it on for him, \u201cPut it on. I\u2019m gonna take you to the hospital.\u201dHuo Qu felt something was not right, but he could come up with an excuse to retort Qinghuan. So he could only nod obediently and do as what he said.The shooting site of The Line of Life and Death was very desolate. There was no hospital nearby at all. Besides, Yu Qinghuan was worried that Huo Qu was sickly ill, so he dare not delay and found an infirmary in a college not far away.It was nearly wee hours, there was few students in the hospital, and those doctors on duty had already slept, only a nurse serving at the window, yawning.Yu Qinghuan described Huo Qu\u2019s symptoms to the nurse, and the nurse looked a little embarrassed, \u201cWe can\u2019t do general check-up for now. What about you wait here? I\u2019ll go ask the doctor.\u201dYu Qinghuan thanked her and then held Huo Qu\u2019s hand and sat on the chairs at the doorway.There was no heating in the corridor. With wind blowing through the door slot, one would feel cold deep to the bones.Yu Qinghuan was wearing a thick and warm down jacket, so it was nothing to him, only feeling freezing pains in the face, while Huo Qu was only wearing a black woolen coat. Now even his nose turned red with cold.Yu Qinghuan wanted to give his down jacket to him, but he refused no matter what. So finally Yu Qinghuan could only unzip his down jacket and said to Huo Qu, \u201cCome here. Put your head in.\u201dHe could not get near to Qinghuan again!Before the heat on Huo Qu\u2019s face was gone, his heart started to beat faster on hearing him. He wanted to refuse, but his body made the reaction ahead of his brain. When he came to his sense, his face was already sticking to Yu Qinghuan\u2019s underbelly\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let him send some warm clothes.\u201d Yu Qinghuan leaned backwards and pulled the front opening hard, trying to cover more of Huo Qu, saying with his eyebrows knitted, \u201cWhy are you wearing a dust coat on such a cold day? You seldom dress yourself up.\u201d\u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d with Yu Qinghuan\u2019s salubrious scent lingering on the tip of his nose, Huo Qu\u2019s head nearly stopped working. After Yu Qinghuan talked for quite a while, he just stammered to say only an incomplete sentence.Yu Qinghuan smiled and flipped his head, \u201cYour reflex arc is as long as hell. Who said you are a genius?\u201dHuo Qu didn\u2019t know why he suddenly had kind of weird expectation. He expected to get Yu Qinghuan\u2019s recognition, his praise, or even expected him to look up to him with admiration like others did.Those things he had never cared about now became the only thing he would expect\u201cI\u2026My IQ is pretty high.\u201d said Huo Qu after swallowing some saliva.He was a useless person. Except his high IQ, he didn\u2019t know where he deserved Qinghuan\u2019s praise.\u201cI know.\u201d Yu Qinghuan smiled, and then wrapped this stubborn head in his chest even harder.After having waited for over ten minutes, the doctor walked out of the rest room, with that pair of glasses skew, saying with kind of impatient tone, \u201cYou are lucky today. I can do the EGG for now.\u201dSpeaking of which, the doctor started to size them up, \u201cWhich one of you? Come inside with me.\u201d\u201cGo with the doctor,\u201d Yu Qinghuan pushed Huo Qu, \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting outside.\u201dHuo Qu wouldn\u2019t stand up. Then Yu Qinghuan bumped his belly with his ankle, \u201cCome on. Don\u2019t keep the doctor waiting.\u201dThen Huo Qu followed the doctor reluctantly.The doctor on duty was an old hand, and did the EGG for Huo Qu very quickly.Except that his heart beat faster, no other problem was found, including the arrhythmia Yu Qinghuan had anticipated.The doctor looked at Huo Qu\u2019s red face and then his inspection result, saying with a suspicious tone, \u201cYour heart is very healthy. If you are still worried, you can go to a big hospital for further inspection.\u201d After a little pause, he continued, \u201cAs for the fast heartbeats and blushing\u2026Are you very nervous?\u201dOn hearing that, Yu Qinghuan who had just shelled out immediately denied it, \u201cNo way. Thank you, doctor. I will take him to a big hospital when I have time.\u201dYu Qinghuan felt relieved after making sure Huo Qu had no heart problem. Although the result was kind of ambiguous, at least it could make him feel at ease for now.Having bustling about the whole night, Yu Qinghuan felt exhausted. He slipped into bed the moment he went back to the hotel. As for Huo Qu, after pondering for a long time, he even didn\u2019t know when he fell asleep.The next morning when Yu Qinghuan woke up, he felt his body was very stiff, and hard to breathe. He struggled to open his eyes. The first thing that came into his eyes was not the ceiling of the hotel, but a fair and beefy chest.When Huo Qu was before him, he was like a piece of paste which could be made into any shape as he wanted. But when he was asleep, he was very domineering, holding Yu Qinghuan tightly with that pair of strong arms.Yu Qinghuan moved a bit, only finding his arms holding even tighter.Huo Qu not only had a pretty face, but also owned a strong body. Commonly speaking, someone like him who would stay in the lab the whole day should have loose limbs. But Huo Qu, his body had a smooth line, covered with a layer of thin but tight muscles, really an eye candy.Yu Qinghuan nearly got turned on by this seductive body. Then he came to himself, pulled off his hands with all his strength and slipped out of his arms.While Huo Qu was fast asleep, someone woke him up with force violently, then he slowly opened his eyes, grieved.\u201cEh-hem, you keep sleeping. I got work to do.\u201d Yu Qinghuan felt a little sorry. He patted Huo Qu\u2019s head softly, then went to the bathroom after putting on his clothes. After he got dressed up, he saw Huo Qu sitting on the bed well-dressed already, who was leafing through his script.\u201cWon\u2019t you go on sleeping?\u201dHuo Qu shook his head and then looked at Qinghuan, \u201cI wanna be with you.\u201d\u201cThen go wash up.\u201d Yu Qinghuan urged him while pulling the script from his hands, \u201cI got a scene to shoot this morning. I don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll start, so I can\u2019t wait you for too long.\u201dBefore he finished his words, Huo Qu already rushed into the bathroom anxiously.He washed up very quickly, maybe because he boosted his speed. 15 minutes later, they left the hotel for the shooting site.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)Translator: Guy Gone BadYu Qinghuan\u2019s part was not the first. After watching others acting for some time, he went to a corner memorizing his lines while waiting for his part.Yu Qinghuan formed a habit when filming. That is he would recite his lines by heart and always familiarize himself with other\u2019s lines, so he would make the best response according to the context.\u201cQinghuan, come here. Come here. Eat some roasted sweet potato.\u201d While he finished one page and was about to recite the next one, Yu Xin trotted at him with a paper bag in his hand. He then picked the softest one and handed it to Qinghuan, saying while smiling, \u201cIt\u2019s sweet. Shen Yi\u2019s assistant sent it to you.\u201dShen Ji was the most popular B-list celebrity under Yu Xin. In the previous life, on the way Yu Xin sent him to the shooting set, they had a car accident and Yu Xin died on spot.Yu Xin had a kind heart. In case Shen Yi\u2019s face got disfigured, he covered his face with all he could. And the result was everyone died on spot while Shen Yi only had some bruise on his arm.But Shen Yi forgot Yu Xin\u2019s funeral, because he served his sugar daddy that day.Although Shen Ji became the target of public criticism after that thing was exposed, Yu Qinghuan still bore the grudge against him.Now looking at the juicy and fragrant roasted sweet potato after remembering the past, Yu Qinghuan immediately lost the appetite. He asked Yu Xin while peeling off the sweet potato skin, \u201cWhat is he doing here?\u201d\u201cNothing important.\u201d Yu Xin shook his hands while smiling, \u201cHe just passed by.\u201dHow is it possible!Their shooting site was located in such a resolute place where even a bird wouldn\u2019t lay eggs. Shen Ji could never drop by as he claimed.But seeing Yu Xin in a good mood, Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t want talk much about it, so he continued, \u201cI heard he has got a role in a TV series recently. Don\u2019t you wanna go have a look?\u201dOn hearing that, Yu Xin shook his head, with all gratitude on his chubby face, \u201cShen Ji is really a good guy. He knew that I have just taken you over, so he said he doesn\u2019t need me this time. He\u2019ll take care of everything by himself and ask me to focus solely on you. Alas! Even though I have no A-list big stars under my hands in this life, it\u2019s already worth it to have your guys as my friends.\u201dYu Qinghuan then felt much relieved. He didn\u2019t want to know why Shen Ji came today. As long as Yu Xin didn\u2019t go to his filming site and died a worthless death like in the previous life, he\u2019d feel very satisfied.When Yu Qinghuan was about to say something, he got hit from behind, whoosh, the script in his hand flew out and directly dropped into the basin the crew used as props, like that person did it on purpose.The boiling water immediately wetted the thin papers. Only a few seconds and the script was totally wasted.\u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d The propman with props in his hands hastened to apologize, with regret and self-blame written on his face, \u201cI\u2019m gonna get another script for you, OK?\u201dThe props looked very heavy, and he looked kind of exhausted already, with sweats on his forehead on such a winter day, still panting while talking.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Yu Qinghuan smiled at him, \u201cMind your own business. I\u2019ll get one from Qingyuan.\u201d\u201cThank you, Qinghuan.\u201d That propman finally caught his breath, then went away busy with his work after bowing to Qinghuan.The script was very important for him. It not only was marked with the emphasis, but also recorded his own understanding and comprehension of it. If it had been someone hot-tempered, he would have already slapped him in the face.Thinking of that, the propman turned around and cast a glance at Yu Qinghuan, deciding to be his big face from now on.\u201cI think you should really go to some temple and burn some incense.\u201d Seeing the propman walk away, Yu Xin said to Yu Qinghuan, \u201cEndorsement snatched first, now script ruined, how could you be so hapless recently?\u201dSeeing Yu Qinghuan still look like nothing happened, Yu Xin couldn\u2019t help pushing him, \u201cGo to Zhao Qingyuan for the script now. It\u2019d be your scene later.\u201dEven though Yu Qinghuan had learnt the script all by heart, it wasn\u2019t bad to read some more. So on hearing him, Yu Qinghuan nodded and walked away.But the moment he lifted a foot, someone grasped his hand from behind.Yu Qinghuan turned around, confused, \u201cHuo Qu? What\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go to see him.\u201d Huo Qu pursed his lips, staring at Qinghuan, holding his hand tightly.\u201cBe good. Let go.\u201d Yu Qinghuan tried to pull off his hands. When he was about to say something, Huo Qu said blandly, \u201cAre you going to borrow the script from him? I\u2026I can recite it for you.\u201dRecite???Then with Yu Qinghuan\u2019s jaws dropped and eyes popped out, Huo Qu recited all the content Qinghuan was going to shoot today. Not a single word was mistaken!Yu Qinghuan was kind of dumbfounded, \u201cWhen did you read my script?\u201d\u201cThis morning.\u201d Huo Qu answered honestly. Taking advantage of Yu Qinghuan\u2019s inadvertence, Huo Qu quietly and secretly and slowly got close to him. When Qinghuan came to his mind, he nearly jumped out of his skin by that enlarged face right before his eyes.He complained, \u201cWhy are you leaning so close to me?\u201d and then continued, \u201cSo you memorized it all in such a short time?\u201dHuo Qu nodded honestly, \u201cYeah.\u201d After a pause, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s easy.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2)Translator: Guy Gone BadAs the provincial top scorer of liberal art in the college entrance exam, Yu Qinghuan thought his memory had already surpassed most people. So many of his classmates asked him enviously whether he had any special method, and Yu Qinghuan always gave them the same answer, \u201cNo special means. I just can memorize things after I read them.\u201dAnd those classmates all complained and wished that they could switch their heads with him.And now the payback came. Now he knew how his classmates felt in those years.Yu Qinghuan gave Huo Qu a complicated peep and then pulled him to one side, saying with a snicker, \u201cWell, you recite it for me one more time, in a slow way, I mean.\u201dHuo Qu had no idea he was playing a prank on him. So he just recited it all over again. After finishing it, he looked at Qinghuan with his head titled, eyes shining, \u201cQinghuan, you want me to do it again?\u201dHe likes this kind of feeling, the feeling\u2026Qinghuan needs him.How he wished that time would freeze at this moment. He is not a monster or a useless person. He could help Qinghuan at least.\u201cNo.\u201d Huo Qu\u2019s innocent eyes made Yu Qinghuan feel very guilty. He couldn\u2019t help stretching out a hand to stroke his hair, \u201cYou did a good job. And with your help I could memorize it all.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Huo Qu popped out his eyes, and leaned toward Yu Qinghuan happily, asking, \u201cDid I really help you? For real?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Yu Qinghuan raised his head and looked at him, smiling, \u201cYou are pretty impressive.\u201dThen he saw a big smile blooming on Huo Qu\u2019s face, which nearly eclipsed the winter sun.Yu Qinghuan had waited the whole morning, but Liu Jia\u2019an didn\u2019t call him, because Fang Zhongxi had kept NG. He just couldn\u2019t pass that one.\u201cForget it. Have some rest. Let\u2019s do it again this afternoon.\u201d Finally Liu Jia\u2019an was even not in the mood of scolding him and just closed the monitor.Actually Fang Zhongxi\u2019s acting was not bad, and he worked very hard. Liu Jia\u2019an kind of liked him. But today he was just not himself, either forgetting his lines or not in the right mood.Even though the whole crew was pressed for time, Liu Jia\u2019an was a perfectionist. As long as the acting was not what he wanted, he wouldn\u2019t let it pass.\u201cSorry, director. Sorry for the trouble.\u201d Fang Zhongxi kept apologizing and promised, \u201cTrust me. I will do it right this afternoon.\u201dLiu Jia\u2019an nodded without saying a word.On seeing that, Fang Zhongxi felt much perturbed and dare not say more. He then left moodily.\u201cZhongxi, it\u2019s fine. Just the spokesman of Chicly.\u201d On seeing Fang Zhongxi\u2019s darkened face, his broker tried to comfort him, \u201cThere\u2019re many opportunities out there.\u201d\u201cStop it! You always say that!\u201d Fang Zhongxi covered his face bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m no longer young. If I keep relying on my face, even I feel ashamed of myself. I have done so much for the spokesman of Chicly, now someone else snatched it!\u201dKnowing he was not in the mood, the broker dare not say others words to irritate him, so he tried to switch the topic, \u201cBut you are trying to transform. Getting a part in The Line of Life and Death is the best proof. Since Liu Jia\u2019an hired you, it means you have your commercial value. Don\u2019t think too much. Hard work pays off.\u201dAfter a long silence, Fang Zhongxi heaved a sigh, saying, \u201cI took the wrong path before. No one has seen my efforts.\u201d After a pause, he turned to his broker, \u201cYou go inquire about Ada for me. They are choosing a spokesman for their watch recently.\u201d\u201cZhongxi!\u201d His broker was startled with his eyes wide open. \u201cThat is A-D-A! How could such a luxury brand hire you as\u2026\u201d After looking into Fang Zhongxi\u2019s ironic eyes, he just swallowed the next few words.\u201cYeah, how could they want a C-list celebrity like me?\u201d Fang Zhongxi sneered, \u201cIs that what you want to say?\u201dBefore his broker answered him, he continued, \u201cDoesn\u2019t that even matter? Anyway they just want a watch spokesman,\u201d Fang Zhongxi then lowered his voice with his head down, \u201cI heard their design director is into men\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d His broker never expected Fang Zhongxi would go down so low. He looked at him disapprovingly, \u201cZhongxi, it\u2019s only an endorsement.\u201d\u201cYeah, just an endorsement.\u201d Fang Zhongxi muttered to himself, \u201cBut I just can\u2019t get it. What should I do?\u201dHis voice was low, but inundated with desperation and dark. After gazing at him for quite some time, his broker looked away, \u201cI know. I will take care of it.\u201dWhile at the film set, when Yu Qinghuan just sat down and was about to dig some food, he got dumbfounded by the news Yu Xin had brought, even nearly knocked over his lunch box. If it hadn\u2019t been Huo Qu who was quick enough, his lunch would be flushed down the toilet.\u201cWhat? How is it possible Ada would want me as their spokesman?\u201d It nearly drove Yu Qinghuan crazy. He tried to confirm it with Yu Xin again and again, \u201cDude, are you mistaken? How could that be? I even failed the audition of Chicly.\u201d\u201cTold ya. That\u2019s because Chicly has a poor taste.\u201d Yu Xin felt like he was gonna fly, \u201cEat your food. And we\u2019ll go to see their design director later. It won\u2019t take you long, four hours on tops. Anyway, your part comes last today. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cNo! What if everything goes very smoothly here and it will be my part soon? I have to wait for my turn.\u201d Yu Qinghuan refused.Seriously? Finally his creepy good luck had a sign of vanishing, how could he try to maintain it? He had to figure out a way to turn it down.When Yu Qinghuan was still thinking, Liu Jia\u2019an\u2019s chipper laugh was heard from behind, \u201cQinghuan, just go. It\u2019s OK. I got a lot of other scenes to shoot, so you won\u2019t be necessary the whole afternoon. Just make sure you could come back before 7.\u201dYu Qinghuan turned around impassively, seeing that Liu Jia\u2019an and Jiang Qi were moving to his side with cigars in their mouths, saying, \u201cI like Qinghuan\u2019s personality, earnest, responsible and honest!\u201d\u201cYeah, Qinghuan has superb moral quality.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dNo!

(3)Translator: Guy Gone BadThe design director of Ada was called Evensen, a handsome man with blonde hair and blue eyes, very outgoing. The moment he saw Yu Qinghuan, he was trying to hug him. But the moment he was about to touch Qinghuan, Huo Qu stopped him.Avenson was kind of confused. He meant to ask why, but on seeing Huo Qu\u2019s hostile eyes, he immediately understood. After lingering his eyes on Yu Qinghuan for a second, he never had any physical contact with Yu Qinghuan, but came straight to the point\u2014the endorsement of Ada.When in the working mode, Evenson looked extra serious. He detailedly inquired about Yu Qinghuan\u2019s physical data, made Yu Qinghuan do some poses for him, and even asked the accompanying photographer to take some photos. After scrutinizing these photos and Yu Qinghuan\u2019s face, he then put these photos down and stretched out a hand, \u201cIn the coming year, may we have a pleasant cooperation.\u201dSo\u2026he got it?!Only a few glances and they decide to use him?Has Ada always choose a spokesman so hastily?If it hadn\u2019t been the warm touch from his hand, Yu Qinghuan nearly thought this was a dream!Although it was only a one-year contract, it was Ada! As a newcomer who had no representative works, he got chosen as the spokesman of Ada! This was so unreal!He could imagine the mega-hit after Ada released this news.Yu Qinghuan then went back to the film set, still muddleheaded, while Evenson took a taxi to Starlight instead of going back to the hotel.\u201cSo, you make the decision after seeing him in person?\u201d asked Huo Rong who was leaning on the couch.\u201cYeah.\u201d Evenson thought highly of Yu Qinghuan, \u201cWhether his body or his temperament, he perfectly matches the normcore series watch of Ada\u2019s.\u201dAfter a pause, maybe afraid that Huo Rong may raise additional conditions, he then added, \u201cBut he has no fame. You know, for a spokesman, this is the biggest drawback. If it hadn\u2019t been that I owe you, I would never use him.\u201dHuo Rong sneered, \u201cFame? Wait half a year and see. You make a good bargain, you know. 1.2 million a year, pretax, you think that\u2019s too much? Beside,\u201d He then looked at Evenson bitterly, \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know? The normcore series is the most underappreciated among your products. Otherwise you would never agree even if you owe me big.\u201d\u201cNothing can be hidden from you.\u201d Evenson laughed, didn\u2019t show any bit of embarrassment after being exposed in the face.After a pause, he suddenly changed the subject, \u201cYu is really handsome. I will definitely chase him if he has no boyfriend.\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Huo Rong immediately jumped out of the couch and raised his voice, \u201cYou said Qinghuan has a boyfriend?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Evenson looked at him, confused, \u201cThe man who is a little taller and always wears that emotionless face around him, isn\u2019t it his boyfriend? Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know.\u201dAfraid that Huo Rong didn\u2019t believe it, Evenson specially told him every detail of what had happened today and then added, \u201cTrust me. I swear in the name of my so many years\u2019 experience of relationship, that man is his boyfriend!\u201dHuo Rong felt like he was gonna black out.No wonder he already felt something ain\u2019t right!No wonder his stubborn younger brother started to admit the mistake he had made! No wonder he would come back from America no matter what on hearing Yu Qinghuan was bullied! No wonder he would insist being around Yu Qinghuan!So this kid liked Qinghuan!His younger brother became gay without everyone noticing! Holy crap!Suddenly nosing a huge secret of his younger brother, Huo Rong felt terrified but dare not tell anyone else. Afraid that this may drive him crazy, he dialed Huo Zheng\u2019s number and told me this on the phone. He kept sighing, \u201cZheng, what should we do? How could he like Qinghuan?\u201dHuo Rong was not stupid. He thought about Yu Qinghuan\u2019s attitude towards Huo Qu and realized that Qinghuan didn\u2019t take it that way at all. So his younger brother just carried a torch for Qinghuan like a fool.Whoever his younger brother was with, he would always wish him the best, but\u2026Huo Rong still thought Yu Qinghuan wouldn\u2019t respond to Huo Qu\u2019s affection. Besides, he would be worried if Qu was really in a relationship with Yu Qinghuan.Yu Qinghuan was handsome, related well to people, so there would be a long line there chasing after him. As otherworldly as his younger brother was, he wouldn\u2019t even know when someone stole Qinghuan away from him.On hearing that, Huo Rong accidentally dropped a glass on the floor. After quite a while, he asked, \u201cAre you sure?\u201dHuo Rong, \u201cI am 100% sure.\u201dHuo Zheng then said calmly, \u201cYou stay out of it.\u201dBefore Huo Zheng finished his words, Huo Rong already protested, \u201cHow could I stay out of it? Life is already so hard on him. How can we let him take that road?\u201dHuo Zheng put the phone away from his ear. After Rong finished, Huo Zheng then put it back and said, \u201cOh, so you can handle it?\u201d After a pause, he added, \u201cSo Qu listens to you?\u201dHuo Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dIt seemed\u2026he really could not handle it.But this was something huge. How could he stay out of it?\u201cThen what should we do?\u201dHuo Zheng now sounded bland. When he heard about such a huge thing at first, he showed kind of discomposure and soon had no further freaking reactions, \u201cLet him make the decision.\u201d After a pause, he continued, \u201cBesides, given Qu\u2019s situation, we still have no idea whether it\u2019s that kind of like.\u201dHuo Rong\u2019s eyes immediately shone. Right! How could he forget about this! If Qu\u2019s feeling was not love, just that kind of possessive feeling between friends, and if he suddenly butted in and misled Qu, he might really fall in love with Qinghuan.On thinking of that, Huo Rong couldn\u2019t help but sighed, \u201cExperience counts!\u201dHuo Zheng, \u201cI was born just one minute earlier!\u201dHuo Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(4)Translator: Guy Gone BadHuo Qu had no idea that his two brothers were worrying about him. At this time, he was at the filming set, sitting on a small stool, waiting for Qinghuan\u2019s part, with the notebook Qinghuan newly bought him, on which he was writing and drawing something.While now Yu Xin was staring at him, with his mouth wide open and eyes nearly popped out.Huo Qu had just said he wanted to learn how to recognize the ways, so Yu Xin searched a detailed local map on the internet for him\u2026And then\u2026he saw something no human would even achieve\u2026Those complicated and heterogeneous streets and shops, Huo Qu could draw all of them after watching the map for only tens of minutes!Yu Xin couldn\u2019t believe it! So holding the determination of finding the truth, he compared the map Huo Qu drew with the one on the internet with every bit of detail, and finally he had to admit a genius was really different from the common people. There was really no single mistake of the map Huo Qu drew!This is\u2026giving those common people no chance!Having no idea of Yu Xin\u2019s abomination, Huo Qu suddenly put down the map and stood up, \u201cDo you know where the bathroom is?\u201d\u201cOh, well.\u201d Yu Xin suddenly came to himself, and pointed to one direction, \u201cWalk that way and turn left at that shack, and walk straight, and you will see it on your right hand.\u201dHuo Qu pursed his lips but didn\u2019t move.Yu Xin asked with confusion, \u201cWhat?\u201dHuo Qu smiled awkwardly, \u201cWell\u2026can you lead the way? I have no idea of what you are saying.\u201dYu Xin was struck dumb for a bit and then said, \u201cOK. OK. I\u2019ll lead the way!\u201dSpeaking of which, he already led the way in front of him, with pride written on his face.Someone who could remember the whole city map in tens of minutes could not find the bathroom?! Gee!Yu Qinghuan peeped at their side when making preparations and felt much relieved on seeing that Yu Xin was with Qu.\u201cQinghuan, come here.\u201d Liu Jia\u2019an shouted at Qinghuan through his typhon.Yu Qinghuan immediately drew back his sight and trotted at him, \u201cDirector, you want me?\u201d\u201cHow is your drinking capacity?\u201dThe next scene was about what happened after Ye Sheng arrived at the battlefield.All the other doctors and nurses had arrived at the military hospital in the first place for the rescue work. Only Ye Sheng, because of indignation and fear, not only wouldn\u2019t join the rescue operation, but even drowned his sorrows.And one day when he was still plastered, the battlefield suddenly had a bombing and the hospital received more patients, making it very short of hands. Peng Cheng had no choice but to drag Ye Sheng to the hospital.Ye Sheng drank some wine but not very drunk. He was kind of excited now, hands shaking, which could not take up the scalpel now. However hard he tried to control his hands but still failed.At last, he could only see the patient who he could have saved if he had been sober die slowly in front of him.That was a turning point in Ye Sheng\u2019s life.\u201cNot good.\u201d Yu Qinghuan squeezed out two words, and after a pause, he added, \u201cvery bad actually.\u201d\u201cThat ain\u2019t work.\u201d Liu Jia\u2019an rubbed his head chagrined.An absolute sober person, however good his acting skills were, wouldn\u2019t be able to show that kind of a little drunk but with a bit excitement feeling. He meant to let Yu Qinghuan drink a little alcohol, plus his superb acting skills, this scene would be easily passed.But now he knew that Yu Qinghuan was bad at drinking! What to do? What if Qinghuan really got drunk and couldn\u2019t do the acting? That\u2019d be a disaster.\u201cI can try.\u201d Yu Qinghuan took a deep breath and made up his mind, \u201cJust a little, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Liu Jia\u2019an nodded and then turned to Jiang Qi, \u201cGet him a 8\u00b0 Rio,\u201d after giving it a second thought, he then changed, \u201cForget it. 5\u00b0 will be fine.\u201dThen after peeping at Yu Qinghuan\u2019s slim body, he then heaved a long sigh, \u201cNo, 3\u00b0 will be enough.\u201dIf Qinghuan really got drunk, he could never carry such a tall man over 180 cm.Jiang Qi held back his laughter and threw him a bottle of wine, \u201cDude, save it. Remember? We only have 8\u00b0 Rio.\u201dLiu Jia\u2019an could only take it and handed it over to Yu Qinghuan, warned him again and again, \u201cYou just take a sip. Never ever get drunk!\u201d\u201cI know, director.\u201d Yu Qinghuan responded awkwardly. He then opened the bottle and drank half of it sip by sip.He didn\u2019t feel anything wrong, so he took a few more sips and then put it down and said to Liu Jia\u2019an, \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201dYu Qinghuan could feel that he was kind of more excited than usual, but still sober, and wouldn\u2019t wobble when walking, which was the perfect state for the scene.\u201cHurry! Lighting! Props! On your marks!\u201d On hearing Qinghuan\u2019s signal, Liu Jia\u2019an immediately asked them to be in set. After observing Yu Qinghuan for a few seconds, Liu Jia\u2019an moved before the monitor satisfactorily.Yu Qinghuan perfectly grasped the feeling between sober and drunk. He didn\u2019t express Ye Sheng\u2019s drunken state in the tradition exaggerating way, but through his eyes, moves and flushing corner of his eyes.And his way of acting won Liu Jia\u2019an great appreciation. After watching the whole scene behind the monitor with smiles on his face, Liu Jia\u2019an praised him, \u201cYou have made great progress than when you first came.\u201dAfter thanking him and making sure his part was done, he then left with Huo Qu.Maybe because of the alcohol, he felt like he became more and more excited, and couldn\u2019t control his glimmer of smile at all.\u201cStop laughing like that.\u201d While Huo Qu went to get some water fro him, Yu Xin warned Yu Qinghuan, \u201cWhat if some girl falls for you if you keep smiling like this?\u201dYu Xin knew Qinghuan looked good, but even so, he had already got used to that pretty face after being with him for so long.The bland feeling on Yu Qinghuan was totally gone. Yu Qinghuan\u2019s beautiful amorous eyes had that gentle smile, light lips curled up, even the move of sitting there casually already exposed that kind of dissolute and attractive feeling..\u201cIsn\u2019t there no girls here?\u201d Provokingly, the smile on Yu Qinghuan\u2019s face became much bigger.\u201cForget it. Do whatever you want.\u201d Yu Xin just ignored him and left.Yu Qinghuan sat on his bed and waited for some time, but Huo Qu still hadn\u2019t got him the water, so he went to the kitchen himself.Huo Qu was still working on that electric kettle, sweating profusely, knocking the body of the kettle and then hearing its sound, looking quite anxious.\u201cPress the button.\u201d Yu Qinghuan walked to him while saying so.\u201cAh?\u201d Huo Qu responded and immediately lowered his head to look for the button awkwardly.Yu Qinghuan couldn\u2019t bear to see it, so he walked over and pressed the button at the bottom of the kettle and then the heating light was on.Yu Qinghuan patted his back of the head and teased, \u201cYou little fool!\u201dThis was the first time someone called him fool, but Huo Qu didn\u2019t get angry at all. He wanted to talk back, but when he raised his head and looked right into Yu Qinghuan\u2019s kind of drunken eyes, he immediately lost his voice.At that very moment, the whole world disappeared in his eyes, only that smiling face left.Some kind of thick and domineering desire aroused from his heart, burning in his chest, tempting him and turning him on.He had no idea what that kind of feeling was, and he also had no idea why he was yearning for.He just looked at the man in front of him greedily.\u201cWhat\u2019s up, dude?\u201d asked Yu Qinghuan while looking at him confused.His eyes were so pretty, even brighter than the most shining star in the sky. His eyes showed kind of caring when they fell on him, but Huo Qu thought it was still not enough.He wanted\u2026this person to look at him only all the time.Suddenly some kind of horrible idea flashed in his mind, which even shocked Huo Qu himself.He knew this ain\u2019t no right, but he really couldn\u2019t control himself.What to do? What was wrong with him? How could he have such kind of thought?Some kind of overwhelming desperate feeling nearly got him drowned. He felt so awful but didn\u2019t know how to explain it.\u201cQinghuan,\u201d The water was boiling. Huo Qu raised a hand and gently covered Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes, imploring with a low voice, \u201cPlease! Don\u2019t look at me that way!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You are just not good at such trivial things.\u201dAfraid that he might misunderstand, Yu Qinghuan then added, \u201cLike you are good at Physics, which I don\u2019t know a bit, while I know how to cook and boil water, which can\u2019t do. That\u2019s a normal thing.\u201dHuo Qu was the best god-sent gift, so he would try everything he could to protect him and never let his soft and unique heart get hurt by this world.It\u2019s not like that! Huo Qu didn\u2019t know how to explain but could only shake his head involuntarily.He never cared about things that had nothing to do with Qinghuan. He was just afraid he might do something hurtful to Qinghuan driven by that kind of strange but strong feeling.Especially when Qinghuan looked at him with that pair of smiling eyes, he nearly couldn\u2019t hold it and pressed him against his chest hard. Only he could see him and touch him.\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Huo Qu whispered bitterly, \u201cI\u2019m a monster. I\u2026I am different from others. I\u2026actually I\u2019ve been thinking\u2026of owning you\u2026and letting you stay by my side forever.\u201dHe thought he would be totally screwed, and Qinghuan would feel scared of him and stay away from him like others did. But he didn\u2019t know how to tell a lie and he could not lie to Qinghuan.\u201cQinghuan, am I a mess?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d Yu Qinghuan took his hand down, then looked at him attentively, \u201cHuo Qu, every person living on this planet, is an unique gem different from others. You are just a more unique and more shining gem than the common ones. But it doesn\u2019t mean you are a freak. On the contrary, just because of your uniqueness, you are more precious.\u201dHe then added, \u201cHuo Qu, you are so smart, you will think it through, right?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cNo buts,\u201d Yu Qinghuan stroke his head, \u201cActually I\u2019m kind of jealous of you.\u201dHuo Qu popped his eyes out, wearing an unbelieving expression.\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Yu Qinghuan smiled gently, \u201cYou are smart and the job you are doing matters a lot. This world will do without an actor Yu Qinghuan, but will not do without a scientist Huo Qu.\u201dMaybe because of the alcohol, Yu Qinghuan spitted out those words deep down in his heart, \u201cYou have your parents and your brothers. They care about you. Wherever you are, you are always the most needed one.\u201d\u201cBut as for me,\u201d He forced a smile, \u201canyone can do without me.\u201d\u201cNo, Qinghuan!\u201d His depression different from before stung Huo Qu\u2019s heart, who immediately blurted out without hesitation, \u201cI\u2026I can\u2019t do without you.\u201dHe racked his brains to organize his words, \u201cExcept you, I want no one!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Feeling his awkward care, Yu Qinghuan smiled, \u201cYou are so sweet, so thoughtful, I also want you to stay with me forever.\u201dAfter a moment, the smile on his face faded away, and he said to Huo Qu seriously, \u201cSo you see, wanting to own the most important friend to yourself is not something bad. Don\u2019t feel awful about it. Actually we are the same.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Huo Qu\u2019s eyes shone. So such feeling is normal? He is not a mess or a freak. Qinghuan also feels the same way!\u201cOf course.\u201d Yu Qinghuan stretched out a hand and gently tapped his forehead, \u201cSo don\u2019t overthink things. Studying Physics is the thing you should do.\u201d\u201cHm!\u201d Huo Qu nodded, and the way he looked at Yu Qinghuan was full of admiration.A problem that has perplexed him for so long is solved by Qinghuan with only a few sentences. Qinghuan is awesome!But\u2026He puckered up his lips shyly, and after rubbing the ground with his tiptoe for a little while did he mutter, \u201cQinghuan, I\u2026I want to hug you. Is that also normal?\u201d\u201cOf course, but you can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Huo Qu immediately looked disappointed.Looking at his careful and wronged expression, Yu Qinghuan couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud, then he opened his arms, \u201cI was kidding. Of course you can hug me.\u201dThe next second a strong and warm body already held him tightly.In the kitchen of winder, everywhere was freezing cold, except this person before him.Yu Qinghuan thought, not only Huo Qu, he himself had always yearning for such a hug.Even if he would be single for the rest of his life, the warmth he absorbed from this hug could support him to keep going.In a quiet and warm atmosphere, Yu Qinghuan leaned his head against Huo Qu\u2019s head lazily, saying, \u201cToday I\u2019m gonna teach you another important principle of life. Sometimes when someone says no to you, actually he means yes.\u201d\u201cHm!\u201d Huo Qu nodded.

Here are the names and introduction. Tell me if you find any you are interested. Your part of The Line of Life and Death is almost over. So you should have a plan for your next job.\u201dOn hearing him, Yu Qinghuan immediately lowered his eyes.He really didn\u2019t want to stay in the entertainment circle anymore. He was sick of living under the public\u2019s eyes. After rebirth, he only wanted freedom.After taking a deep breath, Yu Qinghuan turned to Yu Xin and said with a very serious tone, \u201cDude, I need to talk to you.\u201dHe decided to confess to Yu Xin and told him not to put all his heart on him and then told him his own plan, because this was unfair to Yu Xin.He knew that Yu Xin\u2019s biggest wish was to bring out an A-list celebrity in this life.Thanks to the experience in the previous life, it wasn\u2019t a difficult thing for Yu Xin to select some promising celebrities. So to convince him wouldn\u2019t be so hard.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Yu Xin didn\u2019t take it seriously. He smiled while pounding on Qinghuan\u2019s chest, \u201cWhy do you look so serious?

It\u2019s Mr. Zeng.\u201d\u201cI brought the script.\u201d Zeng Peirong picked up the script on the ground covered with snow and threw it at Yu Qinghuan, \u201cHave a look.\u201dActually he didn\u2019t come to fulfill his promise. Actually he was here to peddle his script to Liu Jia\u2019an and wanted him to adapt it into a film, while he happened to see Yu Qinghuan\u2019s acting.To his surprise, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s acting skills had greatly improved than when he first joined the crew.If comparing acting skills to painting skills, the original Yu Qinghuan was like an imitator. However awesome he imitated, he could never create works exclusive to his own.But now, Yu Qinghuan's performance has been able to integrate his personal characteristics and character characteristics, which is very difficult for an actor.Zeng peirong began to find the young man interesting.Gifted, intelligent, and good-natured, he was born to be an actor.\"Mr. Zeng, I...\"Yu Qinghuan pressed her lips, only feeling this thin script in his hand seemed to weigh a thousand KG. He really wanted to quit this career. But how would he refuse him?\"Qinghuan, you need not have psychological burden. He wants you only because you\u2019re suitable for the role.\" Liu Jia\u2019an thought he felt flattered, so he tried to comfort him, \u201cJust accept it. If you are really not suitable, this stubborn old man wouldn\u2019t use you.\"Since Liu Jia\u2019an said so, Yu Qinghuan could not say no. He could only open the script trying to read. But the moment he read it, he immediately fell for it.This movie is called How to Love You, which is a romance movie telling a story of two men chasing a woman at the same time.Both touching and hilarious, very attractive!And Zeng Peirong wanted him to play the second male lead: Wang Chuan, a project manager with no family!To give the girl Zhang Xiaomiao he liked a better life, he voluntarily applied to do projects in the most dangerous place. And when he had been through a hard years, gained the scholarship and was about to go home to unite with his sweetheart, an unexpected debris flow buried him underground forever.Because he had no relatives, the company decided to buy him a cemetery in the suburbs, and held a simple funeral without even noticing Zhang Xiaomiao.Zhang Xiaomiao had been waiting for him for a few months but still got no call or what from him, she thought he had already given her up. So finally she agreed to be someone else\u2019s girlfriend.On seeing Wang Chuan\u2019s character setting, Yu Qinghuan knew that he would never reject it.Wang Chuan was too much like him, living alone in this world, even his death wouldn\u2019t make a ripple.Yu Qinghuan imagined a hundred kinds of scenes after his death, all exactly the same as Wang Chuan.This movie was a great temptation for him, a temptation hard to resist.\"What do you say?\u201d Once Zeng Peirong saw his expression, he knew he was touched by his script, but still deliberately asked him.\"It\u2019s a wonderful script,\" Yu Qinghuan reluctantly felt the cover, bowed to Zeng Peirong deeply,\" thank you, Mr. Zeng.\"Zeng peirong was very satisfied with his attitude, accepted his salute while stroking his beard.He liked sons who were clever and grateful.\"What did director Liu want you for?\" As soon as Yu Qinghuan came back, Yu Xin walked forward and asked,\" about the reshoot of that scene?\"\"No,\" Yu Qinghuan shook his head. When he was about to tell him about Zeng Peirong\u2019s film, Yu Xi already stuffed the scripts into Yu Qinghuan\u2019s hands again, \u201cHave a look at them tonight. Give me a reply tomorrow.\u201dYu Qinghuan looked a bit embarrassed, \"but my next movie is already settled.\"\"What?\" On hearing this, Yu Xin nearly jumped up, \"why did you make the decision without discussing with me? When did you pick up the movie? Who is the director? What's the content?\"The son had just entered the circle, with such a high starting point, who would have a very promising future. What if he was cheated to receive some terrible movie and ruin his own career?Thinking of this, Yu Xin felt both anxious and angry,\" tell me quickly. If it is not suitable, I have to find a way to deal with it now.\"\"Zeng Peirong's new movie How to Love You,\" Yu Qinghuan handed the script to Yu Xin, saying, \"Director Liu\u2019s. I am the second male lead.\u201d.The cup of water in Yu Xin\u2019s hand dropped on the floor, Yu Xin asked, \"who? Zeng Peirong? The No. 1 scriptwriter Zeng Peirong?\"Yu Qinghuan nodded.\" it's only settled for the time being. The specific remuneration and shooting date will be negotiated later.\"After a weird silence, Yu Xin suddenly thumbed up at Yu Qinghuan, \"Qinghuan, in this world, I only admire you!

During daytime he would go to the filming set with Yu Qinghuan and acted as his assistant by the way, while at night, he would go to sleep at 9 obediently.The whole crew knew who he was, plus he always wore that indifferent face to anyone except Yu Qinghuan, few people would talk to him. So, he lived a very comfortable life here.When Huo Rong came to visit him, he could barely recognize his own little brother who became so down-to-earth.At the time, Huo Qu was standing next to Liu Jia\u2019an, helping him calculate the perfect angle to shoot.With strings of precise numbers coming out of his mouth, Liu Jia\u2019an\u2019s face was flushed with excitement.

You brother comes to see you.\u201dYu Qinghuan\u2019s voice immediately turned that bland and serious expert into a cute boy again. His face turned slightly red. He then trotted to Yu Qinghuan\u2019s side and looked at him joyfully, \u201cQinghuan, you want me?\u201dAs for Huo Rong aside, he totally ignored him.\u201cNot me.\u201d Yu Qinghuan adjusted the hat for him and said, \u201cIt\u2019s your brother who wants you.\u201d\u201cQu,\u201d Huo Rong felt very annoyed since he little brother totally ignored him in front of Yu Qinghuan. So he deliberately elbowed Yu Qinghuan aside and leaned before Huo Qu, \u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m here.\u201dAs soon as he finished his words, Huo Qu already put wrinkles in his brows. He then moved aside and didn\u2019t stop until he could saw Qinghuan\u2019s face over his brother\u2019s big face.Huo Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dHis silly brother Huo Rong immediately felt like thousands of arrows penetrating his heart. His little brother he had brought up offered himself to some other man. This felt awful!He decided to take his little brother away from Yu Qinghuan, otherwise maybe someday his little brother would really be his!After a dry cough, Huo Rong directly got to point, \u201cQu, the Institute is urging you back.\u201dThe Institute had all kinds of holidays, but Huo Qu had never taken any. He worked very hard and was self-disciplined, the most wanted employee of any boss.The dean had never expected his most capable subordinate would skip work someday, the I-don\u2019t-want-to-come-back kind.One or two days would be OK, three or five days would be fine, but ten days or half a month? Definitely no!Finally the dean called the Huo Family.All his words were indicating that the lab was going to lay paralyzed, and he wanted Huo Qu to go back to do his job!As for Huo Qu running away from the world academic conference thing, he didn\u2019t care at all!Actually he sent Huo Qu there just to show off, never expected him to exchange with others. His job was to wear that face as a mascot.Such a high intelligent and super capable young talented scientist only belonged to our country! Everyone there would be dead jealous, wouldn\u2019t they?Even if he didn\u2019t have a chance to show off, there\u2019d be next time. Anyway Huo Qu belonged to their research institute. Giving other countries a few hundreds of years, they wouldn\u2019t be able to cultivate such a young talented scientist like Huo Qu!The dean\u2019s OS: With Huo Qu here, we always have the confidence!Even so, the dean still refused to go to him in person. He was smart enough to kick this hot potato to Huo Qu\u2019s family. After a long time meeting, the whole family decided to pass this important mission to Huo Rong\u2026\u201cI want a vacation!\u201d on hearing his brother, Huo Qu said so with every word stressed.If it had been before, Huo Rong would be very glad if his little brother asked for a vacation. But now, it only gave him a headache. This was the first time he felt that the original Qu was not bad.\u201cQu, don\u2019t be naughty.\u201d Huo Rong took out his phone and wanted Huo Qu to take a look, \u201cYour dean has called me quite a few times. It\u2019s something urgent.\u201d After a pause, he made some concession, \u201cif you wanna stay here, you can come back when you finish your job,\u201dFacing his nonstop persuasion, Huo Qu didn\u2019t buy it at all.Finally Huo Rong could only turn to Yu Qinghuan.\u201cBe good! Go back with your brother.\u201d Yu Qinghuan said harshly, \u201cDo you want to quit your job?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d Huo Qu licked his lips and looked at Yu Qinghuan nervously, \u201cBut\u2026I\u2026I want to stay with you.\u201d\u201cThe premise is you should take your own responsibility,\u201d Yu Qinghuan heaved a sigh, and touched Huo Qu\u2019s head, \u201cHuo Qu, I hate those who are stubborn and irresponsible.\u201dThis totally worked on Huo Qu. In case Yu Qinghuan hated him, he immediately replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not that kind.\u201d\u201cBut if you don\u2019t go back now, it\u2019s kind of being irresponsible.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026I\u2019ll go back now.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dHuo Rong who was standing aside dropped his jaws. So his little brother was so easy to tackle with? With only a few words? Had he always been using the wrong methods?On thinking of this, he deliberately spun around and came before Huo Qu and mouthed off, \u201cQu, I also hate irresponsible people.\u201dSoaking in the sorrow of parting with Yu Qinghuan, Huo Qu totally turned a deaf ear to him. He just detoured this giant barrier and came to Yu Qinghuan\u2019s side.Huo Rong, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He kept urging Yu Qinghuan, looking very impendent.Yu Qinghuan could only get dressed up in a hurry and went downstairs. The moment he went into the elevator, Zhao Qingyuan caught up.\u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d He was wearing a black jacket, with earphones in his ears, leaning against the elevator, a totally dandy, \u201cIn case you get deceived.\u201dYu Qinghuan cast a glance at him blandly, \u201cTell the truth.\u201dZhao Qinghuan, \u201cI am bored to death here. Finally there\u2019s not my scene today. Of course I\u2019m going with you.\u201d\u201cSo,\u201d Yu Qinghuan looked at him like he was an amentia, \u201cnext time just tell the truth. Any of your lie would be busted in front of me.\u201dYu Qingyuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dThen he could only agree with a pitiful tone, \u201cI got it.\u201dZhao Qingyuan was really thick-skinned. The second earlier he got choked by Yu Qinghuan\u2019s words, and the second later he already leaned by his side and slipped an earphone into Yu Qinghuan\u2019s ear, \u201cHave a try. This song is a hit!\u201dAfter listening to it for a few seconds, Yu Qinghuan was a little speechless, \u201cThis is like from the stone age. How did you dig it out?\u201dThe song was called Let My Tears Turn into a Missing Rain. In Yu Qinghuan\u2019s memories, it should be at least 7 or 8 years ago since he listened to it last time.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. As long as it\u2019s a classic.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan ignored Yu Qinghuan\u2019s disapproving and started humming with the rhythm.Yu Qinghuan also ignored him, listening to the music while leaning against the elevator and resting his mind.Right after they left, Fang Zhongxi and his broker came.His broker looked kind of reluctant, \u201cZhongxi, will you really do this?\u201dHe had contacted Ada a few days ago. But Ada said the spokesman of the normcore series watch had been settled. And he told Fang Zhongxi about this in the first place, hoping he could drop his evil idea.But what he had never expected was that this news didn\u2019t make him quit, on the contrary, it became a catalyst.\u201cDo I look I am faking it?\u201d Fang Zhongxi snorted.His broker was all good but only liked daydreaming. In this circle, \u201chard work pays off\u201d was only a fairy tale. Without connections or a sugar daddy, however good your acting skills were, you would never stand out!Just playing with a man! He could bear with it. No big deal! He had to pay if he wanted to be famous. Actually he had already been prepared for any sacrifice. If it was not because he hadn\u2019t got a chance, he wouldn\u2019t have ended up like this!Besides, how he became famous wasn\u2019t important. When he really became a superstar, who would care about his disreputable past!On thinking of this, he cast a glance at his broker anathematically, \u201cIt\u2019s OK if you don\u2019t wanna do it. Don\u2019t pull that long face. People who don\u2019t know may think your family member died.\u201dFang Zhongxi was not a sharp-tongued man. He was good-natured actually, or you could even say he was well-mannered. But things weren\u2019t smooth for him recently. Watching those newcomers whose acting skills were no better than him all surpassed him, he just couldn\u2019t hold himself.\u201cYou!\u201d His broker got ticked off. He then snorted while glancing at Fang Zhongxi\u2019s biting face, \u201cOK, I quit! I\u2019d rather not see those nasty things!\u201dSpeaking of which, he already turned around and walked away.Bah! Such an ungrateful asshole! He would like to keep his eyes wide open and see if Fang Zhongxi could make a hit by selling his ass!While now in Starlight, seeing Evenson keep looking at his phone now and then, the assistant couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWill you really see that C-list celebrity? Is it appropriate? We\u2019re going to sign the contract with Yu Qinghuan.\u201dEvenson put on a fake smile, \u201cAre these two things contradicting?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d The assistant blurted out, \u201cYou seeing that little star means you are replacing Yu Qinghuan with him, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cWhat makes you think it that way?\u201d Evenson stood up, with contempt in his beautiful blue eyes, \u201cHe throws himself on me. Why would I offend Huo because of him?\u201dAfter a pause, he adjusted his tie and grinned, \u201cBesides, have I even promised him anything? He offers himself to me for free. Why would I say no?\u201dLooking at his boss\u2019 handsome face, the assistant didn\u2019t know why he shivered subconsciously.When Yu Qinghuan arrived at Starlight, Evenson\u2019s assistant had already made the contract prepared.Having signed numerous contracts in his previous life, Yu Qinghuan had already obtained the special skills of quickly extracting the keys points through the long-winged content. After looking through the contract and finding no problems and preparing to sign his own name on it, Yu Qinghuan incidentally caught a glimpse of Yu Qinghuan and noticed that he was quickly drawing or writing something on a paper.Yu Qinghuan was a little confused. Was there something wrong with the contract and he was taking notes?Zhao Qingyuan was always dandiacal, but at the critical moment, sometimes he was really useful.On thinking of that, Yu Qinghuan made up his mind and said, \u201cQingyuan, would you like to take a look at the contract?\u201dZhao Qingyuan was now still writing swiftly, looking very serious.It seemed he didn\u2019t hear him. Yu Qinghuan could only get up and tapped at the desk before him and asked again, \u201cQingyuan, do you find any problem of the contract?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Zhao Qinghuan was pulled back from his dedicated state. He looked at Yu Qinghuan, confused, then blurted out, \u201cOh, oh, you mean problem. Yeah, what is the next line of a speechless ending?\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe lowered his head and took a look at the paper Zhao Qingyuan was writing on, only seeing a line of big red words: LYRICS OF LETTING MY TEARS TURN INTO A MISSING RAIN!Yu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dGood!

After signing the contract, Ada would pay 1/3 in advance. And the balance payment would be paid off after the advertisement was launched.This was conventional in this industry, no room for negotiation. So Yu Qinghuan signed the contract without hesitation and also signed a confidentiality agreement.Ada requested Yu Qinghuan not to release the news that he would be the new spokesman of the normcore series watch to anyone or any media. He must wait until Adam found a new spokesman of the exquisite series, and then Ada would release the news together officially.Such requirements were what Yu Qinghuan was asking for. So the process was very smooth. When Yu Qinghuan was about to leave, a lot of working staff of Ada even asked to exchange numbers with him.\u201cDude, how much money do I have now?\u201d after walking of the elevator, Yu Qinghuan turned around and asked Yu Xin.Now he had no money to hire a personal financial planner, and he also didn\u2019t plan to in this life. So he just transferred all the money in his account to Yu Xin to manage.\u201cNot much,\u201d Yu Xin counted on his fingers, \u201cI\u2019ve been selecting real estate for you. Those real estates in Hewan Community cost about 18 million, including the fitment cost. So there\u2019s only 2 million left for you to use now.\u201d He then cast a glance at Yu Qinghuan and asked, \u201cWhat? Something urgent?\u201dYu Qinghuan shook his head, \u201cWhen you receive the endorsement fee next week, keep a hundred thousand for yourself and donate all the rest for me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Yu Xin couldn\u2019t believe his ears, \u201cAre you stupid or what? You are in great need of money now. If you donate it all, how do you live?\u201d\u201cI have no commercial activities recently,\u201d Yu Qinghuan analyzed calmly, \u201cAfter finishing my part of The Line of Life and Death, I\u2019m going to the Grand Theater to temper my acting skills. Before shooting How to Love You, I wouldn\u2019t attend any commercial activities, so I don\u2019t have to purchase clothes and ornaments.\u201dAfter trying to organize his words, Yu Qinghuan continued, \u201cmale stars and female stars are different. We don\u2019t have to spend much in daily life. Besides, I only donate 1/3. I still have 2/3 for myself.\u201dIt was neither he had too much money nor he was a fool. No one in this world didn\u2019t care about money. He just couldn\u2019t forget those who lent their hands while he was in his most difficult times.Those people clearly knew what kind of lives they were having, but still tightened their belts and gave material assistance to him.Every single thing those good people had done for him was engraved in his heart.He remembered how he grew up, how he entered into the college and how he got here, so he was very clear that he should help those who had ever lent him a hand when he had the ability.\u201cQinghuan, you are\u2026\u201d Yu Xin looked at him with a complicated look. Thinking for quite a while, he didn\u2019t find a suitable adjective to describe him. Finally he could only heave a long sigh and patted his shoulder and promised him, \u201cI know what to do. You can count on me.\u201d\u201cMe! Me! Me! Count me in!\u201d Zhao Qingyuan then moved his butt forward and said to Yu Xin, \u201cQinghuan is gonna donate 200 thousand? Then I should also do something. I\u2019m gonna donate a little, 2 million!\u201dYu Xin looked at him with his eyes wide open, \u201cMr. Zhao, this isn\u2019t a competition.\u201dOver the past days, Yu Xinhuan had already seen Zhao Qingyuan through. So he clearly knew that Zhao Qingyuan wanted to be Yu Qinghuan\u2019s friend, but not his, so he still used honorific.But\u2026this man was too good at attracting hatred! He called 2 million a little!? What the hell!\u201cOh come on! Don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan then held Yu Qinghuan\u2019s shoulder and grinned, \u201cQinghuan and I are saving the world!\u201dAs saponaceous as Yu Xin was, he already wouldn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore. He rolled his eyes at him secretly and immediately went to drive the car, so he could throw this asshole back to the filming site.But his goddamn second hand Audi went broken, he just couldn\u2019t start the engine no matter how.Finally he could only let Qinghuan and Qingyuan go first while he himself went to repair it.It was nothing for Yu Qinghuan, but not for Zhao Qingyuan.

And after he finally thought it through, he jumped at Yu Qinghuan, \u201cAre you indicating that I am dog?!\u201dAfter a tussle, the room finally regained its tranquility.Zhao Qingyuan sat on the couch wearing that long face, and glanced at Yu Qinghuan bitterly now and then, totally like a little wife who had just been dumped, while Yu Qinghuan was as calm as always.Yu Qinghuan was his best friend, so he would never ever distance him for his sexual orientation.Although he felt a little weird to have a homosexual beside, but compared with that, he cherished their friendship more.Today they are best friends, in the future they will always be the best friends.While at this time in Huo family, they were chatting in the living room.Like usual, Huo Qu just sat there quietly, holding the two goldfish Yu Qinghuan bought him.\u201cQu nearly takes the two goldfish as his sons.\u201d Seeing that Huo Qu was feeding the goldfish carefully according to the fish-keeping guide like he was a father who had just had a baby\u2026Huo Rong couldn\u2019t help saying some harsh words.Hardly had his voice faded away, Mrs. Huo glared at him, \u201care you even his elder brother?

He is a regular of the headlines. And the reason is the newcomer Yu Qinghuan in the same crew with him. Today the two went out together again\u2026\u201dHuo Qu with his head down suddenly raised it!While on TV it was the photos of Yu Qinghuan and Zhao Qingyuan who were walking shoulder by shoulder. Maybe because of the angle, they looked very close.Huo Qu felt his heart skipped a beat. Some kind of indescribable sore and swollen feeling arouse in his chest. He put down the fish tank and suddenly got up under the whole family\u2019s eyes.\u201cQu, are you OK?\u201dHuo Qu didn\u2019t answer, only walking up and down in the living room anxiously.Qinghuan and Zhao Qingyuan looked so intimate, but wasn\u2019t he Qinghuan\u2019s best friend?No, this ain\u2019t no right! Qinghuan is his! He wouldn\u2019t allow him to be close with anyone else.On thinking Qinghuan would be as gentle to Zhao Qingyuan as to him, Huo Qu felt great pains in his heart.He buried his head in his arms, eyes turning red.

He then pushed all of them aside and rushed to his own room, found his phone and dialed Yu Qinghuan\u2019s number with his trembling hand.Soon Yu Qinghuan\u2019s familiar voice was heard from the other end, \u201cHuo Qu?

Let them open the gate for me when I\u2019m arrived.\u201d and then stressed, \u201cI will call you when I\u2019m there. And then you come downstairs. Just stay there and wait for me.

When he was about to say something, his father shut his mouth with an orange.Until Huo Rong informed the gatekeeper and saw Huo Qu go back to his own room, he quickly swallowed the orange and said to his father discontentedly, \u201cDad, what were you doing?

Suddenly he grasped Qinghuan\u2019s wrist, like he was afraid Qinghuan might run away, and begged him, \u201cQinghuan, you can\u2019t treat Zhao Qingyuan better than me.\u201dYu Qinghuan was struck dumb and immediately burst into laughter, \u201cSo you feel awful because you are jealous?\u201dHuo Qu corrected him seriously, \u201cQinghuan, I am not jealous tonight.\u201d\u201cAll right,\u201d Yu Qinghuan rubbed his back to soothe him. He felt that his good temper was nearly worn out. Huo Qu asked him here at such a late night, he was worried that he might be seriously ill, but it turned out that Huo Qu asked him here only because he thought Qinghuan treated Zhao Qingyuan better than him.\u201cThat\u2019s not true. Trust me.\u201d\u201cBut I saw it.\u201d said Huo Qu while looking at him with that pair of dark eyes, \u201cthey even said it on TV.\u201d\u201cWe are good friends, hm\u2026\u201dSeeing Huo Qu was nearing crying, Yu Qinghuan immediately changed his tone, \u201cYou know, they always exaggerate things on TV.\u201dHe knew that Huo Qu was a little different from common people, who needed more patience, so he explained, \u201cHuo Qu, everyone would have a lot of friends. So you can not feel awful because of this. I have a new friend, but it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not friends anymore, right?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Huo Qu shook his head, with all depression written in his beautiful big eyes, \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of friends. I only have one friend, and it\u2019s you.\u201dYu Qinghuan got choked by his words. And he realized he might have hurt Huo Qu\u2019s heart and felt a little regretted. So he held Huo Qu\u2019s hand and tried to remedy, \u201cI know. I know I have a lot of friends, but you are the only special one to me.\u201dHuo Qu\u2019s eyes immediately shone, \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Yu Qinghuan patted his head with the other hand, \u201cSo don\u2019t overthink things. You can call me whenever you feel unhappy. Don\u2019t save it to yourself.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d Huo Qu nodded heavily. And his low mood for a whole night now became a little bright and clear. But\u2026he felt it was not enough. Although Qinghuan said a lot to comfort him, he still felt a little sullen.After quite a while, he squeezed some words, \u201cUrgh\u2026will you still date with Zhao Qingyuan alone?\u201d\u201cAh-hem!\u201d Yu Qinghuan nearly got choked by his own saliva! He wanted to explain what date meant, but thinking of his own sexual orientation, he was afraid he might not be able to explain it clearly in such a short time, so he could only say, \u201cNo.\u201dRight after he finished his words, Huo Qu said, \u201cIf I want to date with you, will you come?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wanted to help but didn\u2019t know how.Yu Qinghuan then teased him, \u201cYeah, very cold. Will you warm them for me?\u201dHuo Qu nodded heavily. After thinking for a bit, he suddenly rolled up his clothes and pressed Yu Qinghuan\u2019s hands against his underbelly.The moment the freezing cold hands touched the warm skin, Huo Qu shivered, but he didn\u2019t move a bit, he even pulled his clothes down a little, wanting to wrap Yu Qinghuan\u2019s hands more tightly.\u201cAre you nuts? How can you put them on your belly!\u201d Yu Qinghuan was surprised and tried to pull back his hands.\u201cI\u2019m not nuts. My IQ is 180.\u201d explained Huo Qu humorlessly, while pressing Qinghuan\u2019s hands more tightly.He was surprisingly strong. Yu Qinghuan couldn\u2019t get them back at all. Finally he just let it go. Anyway Huo Qu could hold it, and he also felt warm and comfortable.On a winter night, even without wind, it was still very cold. After standing there for a while, Yu Qinghuan sniffled and yawned, looking a little sleepy, so he said to Huo Qu, \u201cAre you feeling better now? I have to go back. What about I send you upstairs first?\u201dHuo Qu was still holding Yu Qinghuan\u2019s hands tightly, apparently showing he disapproved.\u201cBe good.\u201d Yu Qinghuan then dragged him and walked to the gate, \u201cI got a scene to shoot tomorrow. So I can\u2019t stay long. I\u2019ll come to see you when I have time.\u201dNow since Yu Qinghuan said so, even Huo Qu didn\u2019t want him to go, he could only nodded while following him behind, but with very small steps, like he was rubbing on the ground with his feet.Finally Yu Qinghuan stopped and turned around, \u201cHuo Qu, can\u2019t you walk?\u201d\u201cYes, I can.\u201d\u201cThen why are you walking so slow?\u201d\u201cBecause I want to stay a bit longer with you.\u201dYu Qinghuan nearly couldn\u2019t breathe. Huo Qu\u2019s handsome face looked extra charming under the street light which nearly blinded his eyes. Suddenly a kind of evil feeling was rising in his heart, like a fluffy tail naughtily itching his heart, making his whole body burning.Yu Qinghuan thought he shouldn\u2019t have such evil idea, so he tilted his head and switched the topic, \u201cDon\u2019t stand under the street light from now on. I got freaked out when I saw you just now.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cBut what? Spit it out!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the brightest under the street light.\u201d\u201cSo what? Do you want to be the brightest star under the sky?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m human, I can\u2019t be a star\u2026I just\u2026I just want you to see me at the first sight.\u201dMaybe because the beautiful moonlight, Yu Qinghuan was always attracted by Huo Qu in spite of himself.This was the first time he put Huo Qu on an equal level of himself, but not took him as a genuine friend who always needed his caring.\u201cI gotta go. You go home.\u201d after casting away those filthy thoughts, Yu Qinghuan pressed the button of the elevator and said so while patting Qu\u2019s shoulder.Seeing Huo Qu nodded, he then turned around and walked away.In the dark, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s fair hands that were swinging with his clothes looked extra conspicuous. Huo Qu involuntarily ran after him, wanting to hold that pair of hands that disturbed his state of mind.But Yu Qinghuan walked too fast. Soon he already disappeared in the darkness. Huo Qu stared at the spot where he left and slowly took back his own hands.When Yu Qinghuan got back to the hotel, his face was nearly freezing. While pouring some hot water for him, Yu Xin scolded him, \u201cYou deserve it! Why the hell did you go out on such a late and freezing cold night? Don\u2019t you feel you are not busy enough?\u201dBut his attitude was a lot better than during the day.That was because this time the gossip between Zhao Qingyuan and Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t invite in any condemning on the internet, instead, they unexpectedly gained the sympathy and favorability of a lot of passers-by.[Have all those media gone crazy? Do you have a bit of professional ethics? Two people went out and it has to be dating?][Hell no!...Apparently Yuan and Qinghuan don\u2019t have chemicals at all! It\u2019s more like an uncle with a husky\u2026Oh my, what am I talking?][So annoying! Can\u2019t they report some uselful stuff?\u201d[Suddenly I realize it\u2019s not so easy to be a star as we imagined. To make a same-sex friend is to be gay? Wow, my sympathy\u2026]\u2026Those netizens all rooted for them this time like they were brainwashed, all swarmed to denounce the media and criticize the bad atmosphere of the netnews, finally they already forgot about Yu Qinghuan and Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s gossip, which made Yu Xin nearly cry his eyes out and want to forward another koi on Weibo.\u201cTrust me. No one was after me. We hit the headlines all because of Qingyuan last time.\u201d said Yu Qinghuan after he drank the whole cup of hot water and felt a little warm in the stomach.\u201cSo you did nothing wrong?\u201d Yu Xin helped him hang his overcoat and tipped him, \u201cYou only have a few days in this crew. Hold it. Just stay in here, never go out or Director Liu would have a word of you.\u201dWhen Yu Qinghuan was about to nod, Yu Xin added, \u201cAnyway you don\u2019t have any serious matter outside.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026All right.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The first scene was between him and Fang Zhongxi.The strange thing was Fang Zhongxi who was always on time was unprecedented late today. The whole crew had waited for him for quite some time and finally he arrive with a sorry face.Since this was the first time, plus his apologizing attitude was very sincere, Liu Jia\u2019an didn\u2019t get mad but only waved at him, letting him get prepared.Fang Zhongxi looked a little not himself, like very uncomfortable. One could tell easily even if he was wearing a thick layer of makeup.\u201cAre you OK?\u201d though they were not familiar with each other, since Yu Qinghuan saw it, he still showed his care when he backed on to the camera.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Fang Zhongxi answered coldly. Noticing he didn\u2019t want to talk to him, Yu Qinghuan said no more but started to clear up his costume with his head lowered.This was the second to the last scene of Yu Qinghuan, still a rescuing scene which was quite energy consuming.When Yu Qinghuan found the right feeling and saw Fang Zhongxi also nod at him, he then showed Liu Jia\u2019an an \u2018OK\u201d gesture.Liu Jia\u2019an understood and scanned the standby lighting engineers, then shouted, \u201cOK! Action!\u201d\u201cMove! Move! Move!\u201d Ye Sheng who had fallen for his work in the battlefield was sweating profusely, with blood stains all over his white gown, totally a different man from that rich kid image.He was the headmost, commanding two soldiers carrying a stretcher, looking very anxious.The gunfire was on, and the injured were carried away one bunch after another. They were totally short of hands. When Ye Sheng was racking his brain to figure out how to transfer those limited hands, he suddenly saw a colleague coming from outside.\u201cGreat. Come with me. The patients are too\u2026\u201d Yu Qinghuan grabbed Fang Zhongxi over joyfully. But before he finished his words, Fang Zhongxi suddenly staggered and fell down.\u201cCut!\u201d Liu Jia\u2019an frowned and shouted at them, \u201cZhongxi, what\u2019s going on? Ankle sprained?\u201dFang Zhongxi\u2019s face was ghastly pace. He looked anguished with cold sweat on the tip of his nose. After resting for some time sitting on the ground, Fang Zhongxi raised his head, \u201cSorry, director. I feel a little uncomfortable.\u201dLiu Jia\u2019an was ill-tempered, but this was about the actor\u2019s health, he could only suppress his anger and turned to Wang Chengcheng and Li Hongxiu, \u201cYou two get prepared. We\u2019ll shoot your part later.\u201dThe two of them responded and went to their own dressing room.While Fang Zhongxi tried a few times but still couldn\u2019t pick himself up. He could only say to Yu Qinghuan with a very low voice, \u201cCome on. Give me a hand.\u201d\u201cZhongxi, isn\u2019t your broker here today?\u201d asked Yu Qinghuan while sending him to the rest room after helping him up.\u201cHm.\u201d Fang Zhongxi answered with a low voice, like he didn\u2019t want to talk about it.Yu Qinghuan was not a gossiping person and asked no more. When he helped Fang Zhongxi sit on the couch in the rest room and was about to leave, he inadvertently scanned his collar and immediately got surprised.Fang Zhongxi now was only wearing a thin costume, the fastener on the top of which was unfastened, exposing the deepred marks on the skin.Though having not experienced, Yu Qinghuan was an adult after all, he immediately recognized what those were.\u201cYou see it?\u201d noticing his staring, Fang Zhongxi didn\u2019t panic but only raised his head and said blandly, \u201cI hope you can keep it to yourself.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Yu Qinghuan withdrew his eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in other\u2019s personal life.\u201d then he turned around and was about to leave.When he just took one step, Fang Zhongxi\u2019s cold voice was heard from behind, \u201cdo you look down on me?\u201d\u201cYou overthink it.\u201d said Yu Qinghuan without turning his head, \u201cthere are too many ways ahead and everyone has his own choice. So I don\u2019t have a thing with your choice at all.\u201dThe narrow and small rest room, the sullen atmosphere, everything here made Yu Qinghuan nearly suffocate. He didn\u2019t want to stay here one second longer. So before Fang Zhongxi said anything, he already pulled the door open and strode away.The wind in midwinter was dry and cold but had a kind of refreshing feeling. Yu Qinghuan took a deep breath and sat in a corner, staring at the ground blankly.This was one of the reasons why he hated this circle. Everyone wanted to be famous by hook or by crook. The dark side of humanity was ruthlessly exposed here.But when Fang Zhongxi asked him whether he looked down him, he still lied.In fact he looked down on this kind of people who used his face or even his body to exchange for a future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yu Qinghuan hurriedly stood up and greeted, \u201cTeacher Wang.\u201dWang Zhensheng waved his hand and sat beside him, \u201cdon\u2019t stand on ceremony with me. Finally you got a little time. I think we can have a talk.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing actually,\u201d said Yu Qinghuan with his eyes lowered, \u201cit\u2019s just some things I can\u2019t think through.\u201d\u201cYou are young. Why bother?\u201d Wang Zhensheng shook his head, \u201cQinghuan, this is your advantage but also your disadvantage. When I was your age, I would do whatever I want. Anyway I am young. I can start over even if I fail.\u201dAfter a pause, seeing Qinghuan still looked in low spirits, Wang Zhensheng didn\u2019t push him but changed another topic, \u201cwhat\u2019s your plan after shooting The Line of Life and Death?\u201d\u201cI want to go to the Grand Theater to learn and improve my acting skills. And then I\u2019m gonna shoot How to Love you,\u201d Yu Qinghuan told him his plan he had arranged for himself, but still looking a little confused, \u201cafter that, I still got no plan.\u201d\u201cI remember I asked you last time,\u201d The smile on Wang Zhensheng\u2019s face gradually gone, he said to Yu Qinghuan seriously, \u201cI asked if you hate acting, but you didn\u2019t answer me. What if I ask you again today?\u201dYu Qinghuan also thought about it very carefully for a while and answered, \u201cI don\u2019t hate acting. I just\u2026kind of hate this circle.\u201dOne could say he was really bold enough to say such words. If others heard of it, they would turn up their noses at it and sniggered that Yu Qinghuan was still wet behind the ears. But Wang Zhensheng just nodded and didn\u2019t judge, but asked, \u201cWhy is that?\u201dThis time Yu Qinghuan answered without even thinking, \u201cbecause it\u2019s too fickle and utilitarian. And in this circle, I feel like every move of mine is under people\u2019s eyes. I can\u2019t do things I want to do. I have no freedom at all.\u201d\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Wang Zhensheng looked at him and said earnestly, \u201ccandid camera and paparazzi are really something you can\u2019t avoid in this circle. But if you are low-pitched enough, protecting your own privacy isn\u2019t so difficult as you imagined.\u201d\u201cAnd, what do you think freedom is? Freedom is not like as you imagined, you can do whatever you want, but when you don\u2019t want to something, you can say no.\u201dYu Qinghuan\u2019s heart skipped a beat and he held his breath.Wang Zhensheng continued, \u201cEvery circle has its own unspoken rules. Absolute clean place doesn\u2019t exist. If you want to quit this circle to avoid such grey zone, you are wrong.\u201d\u201cSo why don\u2019t you change your way of thinking? When you are powerful enough to say no to the rules, or you could even make the rules yourself, will you still care about those things binding you?\u201dYu Qinghuan lost in his words, he even didn\u2019t know when Wang Zhensheng left. When he came to himself, the sun was already hanging over his head.The sun in winter was not scorching hot, but it didn\u2019t have that kind of warmth in summer. Yu Qinghuan raised his head with his eyes narrowed, feeling the sunlight jumping on his face.Now it was time to decide on what path to follow.Since Fang Zhongxi hadn\u2019t recovered, the shooting was also postponed. After staying at the set for a while, Yu Qinghuan went back to the hotel. When he was going to the bathroom to take a shower, Yu Xin stormed in with a pair of red eyes.\u201cDude, what happened?\u201d asked Yu Qinghuan while closing the door quickly.\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Yu Xi clenched his fists, veins bulging out on his forehead, looking extremely angry. He nearly gritted his teeth to restrain his grief and said word by word, \u201cShen Ji used his connections to change another broker.\u201dShen Ji was under him for six years and he also gave all his best resources to him. But in the end Shen Ji kicked him out relentlessly.He understood that Shen Ji wanted to be famous. If he explained that he wanted to change another broker, Yu Xin might not stop him. But he chose such a ruthless way, which apparently indicated that he wanted to draw a clear line between them.\u201cAm I stupid and blind!?\u201d Yu Xin pulled his own hair hard, with all regrets and humiliation on his face.\u201cDude, it\u2019s all right.\u201d Yu Qinghuan comforted him while patting his back to soothe him, \u201cit\u2019s better to get rid of such people like him sooner than later.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019re things you don\u2019t know.\u201d Yu Xin shook his head, nearly shedding tears.He knew that his connections were limited. Compared with those brokers capable of dealing with all men, he was too far behind. But he had really been trying and given the celebrities under him the best resources. But still he got dumped\u2026Is there really no real friendship in this circle?\u201cHe is not the only celebrity under your hands.\u201d Yu Qinghuan couldn\u2019t bear to see Yu Xin like this, he couldn\u2019t help raising his tone while frowning, \u201cYou still have me.\u201dYu Xin raised his head, looking at Yu Qinghuan surprisingly, \u201cQinghuan, will you really use me? Even when you go viral?\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d answered Yu Qinghuan without any hesitation, \u201cyou are my only broker in this life!\u201d\u201cQinghuan\u2026\u201d Afraid that Yu Qinghuan might see his red eyes, Yu Xin tuned his head and said sullenly, \u201cyou have to win some credit for me. Show those people! It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t make them popular! It\u2019s their own problem!\u201dYu Qinghuan was caught dumbfounded. Everything after his rebirth was fast skimming over in his head, like playing a movie.There are things that he can\u2019t escape from, however hard he tried.He sighed slightly and nodded under Yu Xin\u2019s expectant eyes, \u201cHm.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Liu Jia\u2019an replayed that scene in the monitor and found 0 claw, so he let it pass, no NG.Till now, there was only one scene in the movie The Line of Life and Death for Yu Qinghuan.\u201cQinghuan, you stay.\u201d Liu Jia\u2019an moved his eyes from the screen to Yu Qinghuan, smiling, \u201cStrike while the iron is hot.

Check it out for one last time.\u201dLiu Jian\u2019an always made perfection more perfect.No appropriate script?! No shooting!No good casting? No shooting!No appropriate costumes and production group? Still no shooting!Even the props had to be true to life. The gun they were gonna use was a genuine one, but with no bullet in it.\u201cQinghuan, come,\u201d taking advantage that Liu Jia\u2019an was busy with something else, Yu Xin sneaked in and pulled Yu Qinghuan to one side, took out two warm pastes, \u201clater you\u2019ll have to lie on the ground for a long time. Stick this on your waist, or you\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d Yu Qinghuan shook his head, didn\u2019t take them, \u201cIt\u2019s not very cold today. I can make it.\u201dThe lens is the world's most clear foe-light mirror, on the big screen, if there is a slightly inappropriate place on the body, will be infinitely magnified. Though the warm pastes are light and small, but Yu Qinghuan only wore a thin white gown. If the shape of the warm pastes showed or they made his waist swollen, it wouldn\u2019t pass.\u201cYou are really a one-track mind!\u201d Yu Xin couldn\u2019t persuade him, so he could only put them away.Yu Qinghuan looked free and easy, but actually he was a very responsible person. Any job he got, be it big or small, he\u2019d finish it with all his heart, not even a bit of discount.Let\u2019s talk about the warm pastes alone. Actually he saw that even Zhao Qinghuan had a few on his body. Liu Jia\u2019an just turned a blind eye to it. But as stubborn as Yu Qinghuan was, he refused to use it no matter what.Ordinarily speaking, such celebrities would win the broker\u2019s favor. But Yu Xin and Yu Qinghuan were not just working relationship, they were also good friends.In such a cold winter, Yu Qinghuan shot his scene only wearing a thin shirt. How could Yu Xin bear to see it? If possible, he\u2019d rather take his place. Anyway he got a thick layer of fat which could keep out the cold anyway.Yu Xin heaved a long sigh again. His heart was bleeding on seeing Yu Qinghuan who was still losing no time to look at the script.No young people in his early twenties didn\u2019t like hanging out and enjoying his time. But this guy was an exception. He was so self-disciplined. When he was free, he\u2019d either read books or try to improve his acting skills facing the camera. He even had no time to update his Weibo.The only chance to see him become a bit lively was when he was with Zhao Qingyuan.So even the gossip between him and Zhao Qingyuan never stopped, Yu Xin didn\u2019t prevent them hanging out together. He was only hoping that Qinghuan could be more open under Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s influence.While Yu Xin was still pondering, they already started site-clearing. On seeing that, Yu Qinghuan took off the down jacket and handed it to Yu Xin. After tidying up his costume, Yu Qinghuan walked to the site.\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Liu Jia\u2019an came over to explain the scene, \u201cThe key point of this scene is your eyes. Later I\u2019m gonna give you a close-up. You have to express that kind of fear and despair at death\u2019s door.\u201dAfter a pause, seeing Yu Qinghuan nod, he continued, \u201cBut that\u2019s not enough. Ye Sheng dies in order to save a little girl. So you still have to show that kind of joy even death can not overwhelm.\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201d Yu Qinghuan nodded as if absorbed in thought.

(2)Translator: Guy Gone BadFor death, no one would have a better feeling of it than Yu Qinghuan. But despair at the death\u2019s door, he really had no idea.Yu Qinghuan always thought his death in his previous life was quite dramatic. At the time, he went to Zishan Villa to take a look, wanting to buy a villa there to live for the rest of his life. Though he disguised himself, the salesman still recognized him. So he didn\u2019t get free until late in the afternoon.Unfortunately, there happened to be a rainstorm.There was a distance between the parking lot and the sales office. Although he brought an umbrella with him, he still got wet all over. When Yu Qinghuan was to throw his umbrella and directly run to the parking lot, he suddenly saw a person to the left front was directly walking towards a sewer with no lid.That was the most dangerous place on a rainstorm day. One might die quite possibly.Yu Qinghuan was startled and shouted, \u201cbe careful!\u201d then he immediately rushed forward trying to pull him.He never expected that person dodged aside reflexively on feeling that someone was rushing at him from behind. Yu Qinghuan was running too fast, plus the slippery ground, he couldn\u2019t stop and directly fell into the sewer. When he woke up, he had already been reborn.He died without his expectation. It was as easy and simple like drinking water and sleeping.But Ye Sheng\u2019s death was different, which was a very important scene in The Line of Life and Death. So Liu Jia\u2019an would be extra strict with it. If he couldn\u2019t show that kind of feeling Liu Jia\u2019an wanted, he would never let it pass.That kind of extreme despair could not be expressed solely through acting.Then\u2026he could only reply on that thing\u2026The darkest, the most despairing thing in his two lives which he even didn\u2019t want to remember\u2026\u201cQinghuan, are you ready?\u201d shouted Liu Jia\u2019an while rubbing his hands in the cold wind.\u201cYes.\u201d Yu Qinghuan nodded and then walked under the lights after taking a deep breath.All the other actors were already on set. Once Yu Qinghuan was also set, Liu Jia\u2019an already couldn\u2019t wait and shouted, \u201cAction!\u201dIt was on another battlefield. Ye Sheng was standing in the safe area, looking outside anxiously. In the place where bullets were flying stood a little girl with tears all over her face. It seemed she was scared silly by the flying bullets and even dare not move a bit.\u201cCome here! Come here!\u201d Ye Sheng shouted at the little girl using the localism with his hands tightly clenched.Pity that the gunfire outside was too loud. Although he already used his highest pitch, the little girl still didn\u2019t hear him.What to do? What should he do?Ye Sheng was like an ant on a hot pan. As a doctor, he couldn\u2019t bear to see a life vanish before his eyes without doing anything. Besides, that was only a 5 or 6 years old girl. The bullets had no eyes. How could he go out to save her? What if he died but still failed to save her?To save her or not? Ye Sheng was wrestling with himself in his heart.Until an earsplitting bombing sound came to his ears did Ye Sheng made up his mind. He pulled off the Jade Goddess of Mercy around his neck, held it in his hand, and ran to the little girl at his fastest speed. Once he held the frightened little girl, he immediately ran back.The gunfire behind was still rumbling that nearly split open Ye Sheng\u2019s eardrum, but in his heart was full of joys.He made the right choice. He not only saved the little girl, but also escaped out of the gunfire.Great! So damn great!After he went home, he would definitely tell his parents this. He was already not that childish and silly young man. He would be their pride.Ye Sheng\u2019s lips curled up. But the moment one of his feet stepped into the safe area, a bullet flew over and directly pierced through his chest from behind.At this time Liu Jia\u2019an gave him a close-up. Liu Jia\u2019an stared at the monitor, only on Yu Qinghuan\u2019s face, without eyes blinking.The moment the blood bag burst, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes were instantly filled with all despair and pain.That was a part of memory he never had the guts to touch. But taking this chance, it gradually unfolded in his head.His parents died on spot in a car accident on the way to the town to buy him a desk, giving the doctors no chance for the rescue.The folks all said this was the last thing his parents could do for him because they loved their son.His family was poor. If both his parents were in hospital, who could pay for the medical fees? What would the kid do? They\u2019d rather die than push their son to despair, leaving no burden to their son.Yu Qinghuan would never forget that the day before his parents died, his mother said to him with a soft smile, \u201cOur Qinghuan is the smartest kid in the whole town. You will definitely go to very good college and we\u2019ll live a better life. How could a college student have no desk to study?\u201dThat day he had been excited for a whole night. After his parents went out the next day, he took a stool and waited outside the gate happily, picturing numerous scenes how he studied with that desk and even making up his mind what to put on it.However, he would never get the desk.The two people who loved him most passed away with such a tragic way without even saying goodbye to him, only leaving him in this world, alone and despairing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(3)Translator: Guy Gone BadThe moment he held that little girl, Yu Qinghuan knew it was only acting, but still he couldn\u2019t think how he wished that accident had also been a scene in a movie, so when it happened, he would rush out to save his parents like Ye Sheng, even at the cost of his own life.All those thoughts were only a moment\u2019s thing, but had amazing performance on the screen.Liu Jia\u2019an nearly got absorbed in the despair and pain in his eyes. Even when Qinghuan went out of the scene, he was still immersed in it. It was not until Jiang Qi elbowed him did he come to himself and shout, \u201ccut!\u201dBut he still wouldn\u2019t move away his eyes from the monitor. He played Yu Qinghuan\u2019s acting part again and again, and muttered to himself excitedly, \u201cGreat! Awesome! This is it! This is exactly what I expected!\u201dThe reason he decided to shoot it ahead of time was that he wanted Yu Qinghuan to have a try first, to find that kind of feeling. He never expected Yu Qinghuan would give him such a big surprise.\u201cQinghuan\u2026\u201d He wanted Qinghuan to appreciate his own acting, but when he raised his head and looked at him, he was startled.This scene had passed, all the figurants had left on after another and the propmen already began to clear up the props, but Yu Qinghuan was still lying in there, his arms covering his eyes, without moving.Liu Jia\u2019an felt something ain\u2019t no right. When he was about to check him out, Yu Xin already ran over, \u201cQinghuan, are you numb? Get up! Hurry! Lying on the ground on such a cold day? Do you wanna catch a cold?\u201dYu Qinghyuan didn\u2019t move.\u201cQinghuan?\u201d Yu Xin pushed him with a hand, and when he was about to say something, a stifling choking was heard which surprised him, \u201care you crying?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Yu Qinghuan\u2019s voice was a little sullen, with thick nasal, like he was trying to hold something, \u201cI\u2019m just too absorbed into the scene.\u201dYu Xin immediately felt relieved and kicked him slightly, \u201cyou scared the shit out of me. I thought you met something bad. Come on! Get up!\u201d\u201cDude, leave me alone.\u201d Yu Qinghuan\u2019s tears had wetted a big part of his sleeve. When the wind blew, it felt really cold, \u201cjust let me lie in here.\u201dYu Xin could only cover him with his down jacket and sat beside.It was already half an hour later when Yu Qinghuan felt a little better.Some acquaintances also ridiculed him when congratulating him for finishing his part,\u201cQinghuan is too devoted. He was weeping like a girl at last.\u201d\u201cHey, Qinghuan, this is not good. Being too absorbed into the drama may influence your own mental health. Try to relax after you go home.\u201d\u201cQinghuan, don\u2019t you feel ashamed of yourself to cry so hard? Hahaha\u2026\u201d\u2026Yu Qinghuan nodded and accepted all their teasing with a smile. Except his eyes were a little red and swollen, nothing else looked wrong with him.Since Liu Jia\u2019an was going to throw a party for him the next day, Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t go home but still stayed in the hotel.He had no idea whether it was because he cried too hard, he just felt strengthless, head splitting aching. So after taking a quick shower, he went to bed early.Yu Xin came to talk about the future plan with him. But after he called Qinghuan a few times, the other party still had no response. He now noticed something ain\u2019t no right. He stretched out a hand to feel his forehead. It was burning hot!No one knew how long he had having a fever. He nearly fainted. Yu Xin was scared since he had no response. So he immediately called Zhao Qinghuan and sent Yu Qinghuan to hospital together.Yu Qinghuan was in a daze, but he also knew he was sick. When in the car, he tried to open his eyes and apologized to Yu Xin, \u201cdude, sorry to trouble you.\u201dHe was sick but still being so well-mannered. Yu Xin was really touched. He then said crossly, \u201cJust shut up and rest!\u201dThe filming site was too remote. When they arrived at the hospital, Yu Qinghuan already fainted. He even had no response when the nurse gave him a shot.\u201cAlas,\u201d Yu Xin sighed. When he was about to say something to Zhao Qingyuan, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s phone was ringing. He took it out and saw it was Huo Qu. He dare not hang up. So he could only press the answer key and told him the actual situation about Yu Qinghuan.Huo Qu said he\u2019d come right now on hearing Yu Qinghuan was sick.Yu Xin knew his situation, which gave him a headache. But under Huo Qu\u2019s questioning, he dare not refuse to tell him room number. He could only make a call to Huo Rong and explained everything to him.When Huo Rong sent Huo Qu to the hospital, Zhao Qingyuan had just left and Yu Xin went to get some hot water for Qinghuan.Huo Qu opened the door and saw that the ward was empty, with only Yu Qinghuan lying on the bed, showing a burning hot face and his right hand wrapped in medical tape, looking lonely and miserable.Huo Qu's heart suddenly felt like it was being pricked by a needle. He walked to the bed and sat down with his eyes on Yu Qinghuan's face.Yu Qinghuan\u2019s character was cold. So even he was sick, he still obediently lied there, like a poor stray cat.\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Huo Qu leaned forward, eyes turning red. When he was about to say something, Yu Qinghuan whose eyes were closed whispered, \u201cmom.\u201dAt that moment some kind of tremendous sadness popped out from deep of the heart and got Huo Qu drowned in it.In his over 20 years\u2019 life, he had never tried to understand others\u2019 feeling. But at this moment, Huo Qu wished that he could enter into Yu Qinghuan\u2019s brain and see what he was thinking and why he was so painful and helpless.He wanted to protect Qinghuan, he wanted him to be happy forever, he wanted him to stay away from any sad things.An idea suddenly came up and lingered in his mind. Huo Qu realized that Qinhuan would also be weak sometimes and need his help.And for himself, he had to become strong and protect him!\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Huo Qu tried to hold back his tears, lowered his body, carefully avoided the hand having an intravenous drip and held him through the quilt. He gently pressed his face against Qinghuan\u2019s burning face, and stressed every word, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, Qinghuan. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here with you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His head was groggy and his throat was dry and painful, making him extremely uncomfortable.Knowing that his illness might be serious this time, Yu Qinghuan opened his eyes and was about to ask Yu Xin about his own situation, he was startled by the enlarged handsome face in front of him.\u201cHuo Qu? What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI heard you are ill. So I came.\u201dHuo Qu answered honestly. Seeing Yu Qinghuan lift the quilt and sit up, he immediately pulled out a small notebook from his pocket quietly, glanced at it hastily, and quickly put it back.The two were so close that Huo Qu\u2019s little movement could never escape from Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes. As soon as Yu Qinghuan was going to ask what the other party was doing, Huo Qu raised his head, pursed his lips shyly and asked him, \u201cQinghuan, are you thirsty?\u201d\u201cYeah, kind of,\u201d Yu Qinghuan accidentally fell into Huo Qu\u2019s context. When Huo Qu excitedly ran out to fetch some hot water, he realized that Huo Qu had not answered his question.However, he could not take care of so much now. Compared with these, there was a more important question\u2026Could Huo Qu, the direction idiot, come back after leaving the ward? Only god knows which ward he would go to later!Having no time to attend to his dizzy head, Yu Qinghuan quickly jumped out of bed, put on slippers and ran after him. Although he ran fast, Huo Qu was even faster. In just a few seconds, the figure of Huo Qu already disappeared.Yu Qinghuan was anxious, wanting to go to the front desk to ask the nurse to look for Huo Qu. But at this moment, Yu Xin came in with a bag of food. Seeing Yu Qinghuan running around in a thin hospital gown, Xin Yu became angry, \u201cWhat are you doing? You think you\u2019re not sick enough?\u201dYu Xin looked around and asked, \u201cWhere is Huo Qu? Has he been taken away by his brother?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Yu Qinghuan said helplessly, \u201cHe went out to get me some water. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll be unable to come back. I just wanted to find him but I met you instead.\u201dYu Xin, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLet him get the water? You really made a good decision.\u201d Yu Xin almost burst with laughter due to anger. He stopped Yu Qinghuan who wanted to go out again and said grumpily, \u201cSick man, don\u2019t run around. I\u2019ll go find him.\u201dSeeing Yu Qinghuan\u2019s disapproval on his face, Xin Yu immediately glared at him, \u201cMy ancestor, one Huo Qu is enough, please don\u2019t make any more trouble for me, OK?!\u201dSince he already said that, Yu Qinghuan could only give up his insistence and went back to his bed. He told Yu Xin anxiously, \u201cIf you can\u2019t find him, come back and tell me in the first place.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Yu Xin replied. As soon as he pulled the door open, he just bumped into Huo Qu.\u201cYou back?\u201d Yu Qinghuan sized Huo Qu up and down carefully. His face revealed an unbelieving expression, almost like having discovered a new continent.This man could finally find the direction now?Huo Qu didn\u2019t recognize the meaning of his words. He took a glass of water and smiled, walked to Yu Qinghuan\u2019s side and handed it to him, \u201cQinghuan, here.\u201d\u201cEmm.\u201d Yu Qinghuan took the cup with a little bit of stupefaction and drank all the water in one breath under Huo Qu\u2019s expectant gaze.Then Yu Qinghuan found that the dimples on Huo Qu\u2019s face were deeper and he looked very happy.Yu Qinghuan put the cup on the bedside table, patted the spot beside him, and motioned Huo Qu to sit down. And then he asked Huo Qu with his head turning aside, \u201cHow did you find the pantry?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve recorded it.\u201d Huo Qu proudly took out a small notebook and showed it to Qinghuan, his eyes sparkling like a little German shepherd asking for praise.Yu Qinghuan looked down and saw the notebook was thickly dotted with a series of calculation formulas, including the angle of the direction, the distance of walking ahead, and the number of wards he had passed. Even some numbers were accurate to two decimal places.This was the unique way of Huo Qu to recognize directions.Yu Qinghuan asked him doubtfully, \u201cWhat do you write this for?\u201dWas there anything in the pantry that was attractive to him? This kind of method of intentionally writing down the way to get there should require a lot of labor.\u201cI want to take good care of you.\u201d Huo Qu sipped his lips, looked at Yu Qinghuan anxiously, and carefully touched Yu Qinghuan\u2019s forehead like the other party had done to himself before. After a few seconds, he came to a conclusion, \u201cYou are still sick.\u201dYu Qinghuan was silent for quite some time. Then he asked him in a dumb voice, \u201cIs that the reason?\u201dHuo Qu nodded without hesitation, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen when did you do all these?\u201d\u201cLast night.\u201dWith such detailed data and such a huge amount of calculation, Huo Qu probably stayed up all night.When Yu Qinghuan slept soundly in bed, Huo Qu was lying on the cold corridor of the hospital, measuring and calculating little by little. He worked so hard to overcome his inherent defects, only to pour a cup of hot water for Yu Qinghuan the moment he needed it.Yu Qinghuan\u2019s heart ached, and he looked up at Huo Qu. He really did not understand why there was such an adorable and considerate man in this world.\u201cYou must be tired.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201d Huo Qu\u2019s dimple was full of smiles. How could he be tired of serving for Qinghuan?In fact, this work was actually completed by him and his second brother. But Huo Qu did not want to mention his second brother as soon as he saw Yu Qinghuan\u2019s beautiful eyes, and he did not understand why.He just wanted Qinghuan to remember his good. Anyway\u2026anyway\u2026his second brother\u2026he was no friend of Qinghuan.Yu Xin, who stood by, watched the whole process of the two men chatting and felt like himself an eyesore with no reason.Yu Xin, \u201c....\u201dHe was probably infected with the cold virus by Qinghuan and his brain was broken, so he would think of something strange.Yu Xin felt that he should say something at this moment to show his sense of being. But as soon as he opened his mouth, the strange feeling came back.It was really odd!Yu Xin scratched his head gloomily and decided not to stay in this weird ward.\u201cEat the food I bought you while it is still hot,\u201d Yu Xin moved forward and saw Yu Qinghuan and Huo Qu all turn their heads to look at him. He somehow felt a little stressed and even spoke a lot faster. \u201cI have to go to the filming site now and take care of things over there.\u201dYu Qinghuan was now so sick that they would definitely not be able to hold the wrap party. Therefore, Xin Yu needed to tell Liu Jia\u2019an about this and return to the filming site to retrieve Yu Qinghuan\u2019s clothes and articles.\u201cWell, dude, drive slow.\u201dYu Qinghuan watched him leave the ward after the urge.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But when people were sick, the most taboo was not to eat. So he nodded, untied the plastic bag and said, \u201cYes, what would you like to eat? There are gruel and rice here.\u201dHuo Qu did not answer, but quickly picked up a bowl of gruel and said excitedly, \u201cThen I\u2019ll feed you.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c....\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201dHe just had a cold, not a hand injury. Why should he be fed by someone else? And with Huo Qu\u2019s unskilled spoon-using technique, whether he could finish the meal was a big question.But\u2026Why would Huo Qu bear such thoughts?With this in mind, Yu Qinghuan couldn\u2019t help asking.\u201cI searched it on the Internet.\u201d The rejected Huo Qu looked a little depressed, \u201cThe Internet said that the patient should be cared for like this.\u201dWho knew that where Huo Qu saw these terrible answers?Yu Qinghuan would like to explain to him, under what circumstances did the patient need to be fed. However, when he saw Huo Qu slightly lower his head and his soft hair miserably sticking to his ears, Yu Qinghuan had no heart to blame him anymore.If he didn\u2019t guess wrong, this should be the first time Huo Qu offered to take care of others.Maybe it took him a long time to get up the courage to offer to take care of him. So Yu Qinghuan felt that if he poured cold water on him now, the other side would never offer his help initially again.Forget it, Yu Qinghuan thought. Let Huo Qu feed him slowly, anyway, he was not hungry. Compared to this, Huo Qu was more important.He sighed, stretched out his hand and touched Huo Qu\u2019s forehead hair. \u201cWell, I was just joking. Didn\u2019t I tell you that sometimes my no is yes. Keep it in mind, you got it?\u201d\u201cMmm!\u201d Huo Qu nodded vigorously, climbed to the bed with both his hands and feet, awkwardly dug a spoon of gruel, and sent it into Yu Qinghuan\u2019s mouth.Huo Qu had difficulty eating his own meals, not to mention feeding others. Just as Yu Qinghuan was about to open his mouth, Huo Qu\u2019s hand suddenly shook, and a spoonful of gruel was sprinkled on Yu Qinghuan\u2019s collarbone. He let out a cry because of the heat.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d Huo Qu panicked, dropped the gruel box, and apologized repeatedly. His eyes were filled with fear.\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Yu Qinghuan was afraid that he might frighten him, so he endured the pain and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not hurt, I just got a fright, you put the paper towel...\u201dBefore Yu Qinghuan could finish his words, Huo Qu suddenly leaned forward, bowed his heads and licked Yu Qinghuan\u2019s collarbone.His tip of the tongue was agile and soft, it swept Yu Qinghuan\u2019s thin skin of collarbone like a small brush with electric current, immediately let Yu Qinghuan shiver, making his waist limb and numb.However, the initiator of evil did not know about it and even sucked Yu Qinghuan\u2019s skin after licking it! There was a trace of guilt and bewilderment in his voice about doing something wrong. \u201cQinghuan, can you not be angry with me? I will certainly do better next time.\u201dWhile speaking, Huo Qu\u2019s shallow, damp and hot breath was sprayed on Yu Qinghuan\u2019s neck, making his whole body in the heat.\u201cHuo Qu,\u201d Yu Qinghuan gasped softly and settled back into his concentration. He leaned back and distanced himself from Huo Qu. \u201cI\u2019m not angry. Well, don\u2019t look at me like that. I\u2019m serious. Get me some paper towels.\u201dHowever, Huo Qu only stared at Yu Qinghuan\u2019s collarbone, his eyes red with guilt.Yu Qinghuan rubbed Huo\u2019s head helplessly and whispered, \u201cOkay, sweetheart, I'm really fine. Don't be sad, okay? You just sprinkled a little gruel on me. Everyone makes mistakes, it\u2019s all right, huh?\u201dHuo Qu\u2019s eyelashes quivered. His voice was low and he asked without confidence. \u201cQinghuan, do you really not blame me for being useless?\u201d\u201cOf course not. No one is more useful than you.\u201d\u201cThen, did you just call me, sweetheart?\u201dYu Qinghuan froze, he didn\u2019t expect Huo Qu would focus on this. He then smiled, \u201cYeah, you are my sweetheart.\u201dThe dimples on Huo Qu\u2019s face reappeared.They two had a quiet and peaceful day in the hospital but did not know that at this moment there had been a huge wave on Weibo.The cause was Shen Ji\u2019s two microblogs.Shen Ji: Six years of ups and downs.

After figuring out a plan with Xu Ning, he not only stole Yu Qinghuan\u2019s materials, but also asked about him at the filming site of The Line of Life and Death.After making sure what he got was Yu Qinghuan\u2019s real situation, he chose to post two microblogs today.Newcomers in the entertainment circle were emerging in endlessly, numerous handsome actors and pretty actresses. He had struggled in this circle for six years but still a B-list celebrity. He would flop more quickly if things kept going on like this.So he needed an opportunity to break the ice.The best and quickest way to win the public\u2019s favorability was to acting pathetic. But having been in this circle for so many years, he had already tried all kinds of ways. So he could only try some new tricks.Is there any way better to win people\u2019s favorability than being betrayed? In this fast-paced society, no one hasn\u2019t encountered betrayals, whether in relationship, friendship, or ever kinship. So most people had empathy of this word.Setting up such a flag would definitely win a lot of fans and also improve his popularity.Shen Ji smiled smugly, as if he had already seen the scene he became a big star.What about Yu Qinghuan having been stepped under his feet? That was not his concern.This circle was so realistic. If you got stepped under other\u2019s feet, you shouldn\u2019t blame others but could only blame your own weakness! If Yu Qinghuan bounced back someday, he could also tread him underfoot. But he didn\u2019t believe Yu Qinghuan would have such ability!\u201cAre you happy now?\u201d Xu Ning sneered, \u201cif you had been under my hands from the very beginning, you are already a big star now! Who the hell is Yu Xin?! Huh? No one doesn\u2019t know he is a laughing stick in Starlight! He serves those stars under him like a baby-sitter. What\u2019s the use at last?\u201d\u201cYeah, definitely! I\u2019ve already been sick of him!\u201d Shen Ji pursed his lips, with all disdain on his face. He leaned towards Xu Ning and slipped a cup of wine into his hand, saying, \u201cbrother Xu, you are my idol! What is the constitution of your brain? How could you be so brilliant?\u201dHe made clicks, with obvious admiration on his face.This was a flawless plan! It wouldn\u2019t work even if Yu Xin tried to make a clarification on the internet.Without proof, true things could also turn into false things.Besides, he was pretty sure Yu Xin dare not make it big. Yu Xin and Yu Qinghuan both worked under Starlight. If things finally went out of control, one was a B-list celebrity while the other was a C-list newcomer, it was obvious that he wouldn\u2019t be the one getting expelled.So Yu Qinghuan had no choice but to take the blame!\u201cSave it. Stop apple-polishing me.\u201d although he said so, Xu Ning still felt like on wings. He took a sip of the wine and put on some airs as an elder, \u201cyou have a lot to learn from me.\u201dShen Ji kept nodded, \u201cyes, yes.\u201dAs they expected, those netizens almost all supported Shen Ji and denounced Yu Qinghuan.At first it was only between the fans, then even the bystanders joined in. Under Yu Qinghuan\u2019s Weibo were all bad comments. If it had been someone who had bad psychological quality, he would even want to kill himself now.Even for Yu Xin who had been in this circle over 20 years, seeing those nasty words, he nearly smashed his phone.\u201cAre those people nuts? Do they know what the truth is? Huh? How could they blame you?\u201d Yu Xin\u2019s hands were trembling and he immediately updated his Weibo without thinking.Yu Xin: [@Shen Ji, you know it clearly what the truth is! I was blind to select you the ungrateful son! Dare you deny that it was you who demanded to change your broker?! Without Qinghuan and I knowing nothing, you already changed Xu Ning as your broker! Now you are pretending to be a white lotus?!]But Shen Ji didn\u2019t get provoked by Yu Xin\u2019s words. Under Xu Ning\u2019s guidance, he directly forwarded Yu Xin\u2019s Weibo and replied: [dude, having been worked together for so many years, I wouldn\u2019t argue with you.]Like he was forced and didn\u2019t want to haggle over with Yu Xin.Which immediately made the fans and bystanders disgust Yu Qinghuan and Yu Xin more.While Shen Ji on the other side, broker stolen, scolded by Yu Xin, but for the old times\u2019 sake, he took all the blame! What a noble personality!So Yu Qinghuan got scolded more severely. Someone even threatened to Cyber Manhunt him and see whom the sugar daddy was behind him and why he could be so aggressive.Yu Xin was nearly going to explode. He tried to diss those bitches, but Yu Qinghuan stopped him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even his tone was as calm as usual, \u201cXin, now is not the time for the mouth cannon. You go to hire two private detectives. Don\u2019t bargain, as long as they can get the proof that Shen Ji and Xu Ning had contacts before.\u201dHe wrote a few names on a paper and reminded Yu Xin, \u201cthese are secretaries or assistants of the Starlight executive level. You can start from them who are close to Shen Ji.\u201d\u201cBesides,\u201d Yu Qinghuan said with a cold voice with his eyes lowered, \u201cI remember Shen Ji is having a drug problem all the time. So you can ask them to investigate it together.\u201dActually Yu Qinghuan wasn\u2019t so calm as he appeared. He also read the comments Shen Ji\u2019s fans left under his Weibo. He wouldn\u2019t mind if they only said some swearing words to him. But there were some with no sensibility who even fired at his parents. That was something he couldn\u2019t bear.So this time he would not only make this case clear but also discredit Shen Ji and Xu Ning! So they could no longer stay in this circle!Yu Xin was a little startled, \u201cQinghuan, how can that be! Are you out of mind because of the huge anger? How could Shen Jia touch that thing? I\u2026\u201dWhen he was about to continue, Yu Qinghuan interrupted him, \u201cXin, just do as what I said. I won\u2019t make a mistake.\u201dIn the previous life, Yu Xin died in order to save Shen Ji, while Shen Ji was too high with his sugar daddy and even forgot Yu Xin\u2019s funeral. After that, the netizens Cyber Manhunt Shen Ji and soon they found that Shen Ji had a seven-year history of drug abuse.At that time Yu Qinghuan hated Shen Ji to the bones. So he remembered his black history extra clear.\u201cAll right.\u201d Yu Xin gritted his teeth and nodded with his eyes turning red, \u201cI\u2019m going to work on it now. Wait for my good news!\u201dAfter he left, only Yu Qinghuan and Huo Qu were left in the room. Yu Qinghuan still had a low fever, so the doctor said he had to stay in hospital for a few more days. On hearing that, Huo Qu was very worried and wouldn\u2019t leave.Yu Qinghuan took a deep breath and tried to suppress the anger in his heart. When he was about to ask what Huo Qu would like to eat for lunch, he saw that Huo Qu was woodenly pressing the buttons of his phone with the head lowered.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Yu Qinghuan leaned closer and looked at the screen.Then he got struck dumb.Huo Qu is quarreling with people on Weibo!Huo Qu, who didn\u2019t talk to people and even seldom communicate with his family, now is quarreling with others!?Yu Qinghuan thought it was incredible! Even his anger in the heart was totally forgotten now.\u201cYou registered the account yourself?|Huo Qu shook his head, \u201cYu Xin did it for me this morning.\u201d\u201cWhat is it for?\u201d Seeing that he even didn\u2019t raise his head to look at him, Yu Qinghuan felt more curious.This isn\u2019t that Huo Qu\u2019s style! Is it possible he is addicted to Weibo and becomes an Internet addiction?\u201cI\u2019m trying to help you explain.\u201d At this time, Huo Qu finally sent out his last reply. He then handed the phone over to Yu Qinghuan and said seriously, \u201cI can\u2019t see them abuse you like that.\u201dYu Qinghuan felt a little warmth in his heart. He took over the phone, put it on the desk, and tapped Huo Qu\u2019s head with a gentle smile on his face, \u201care you nuts? Why would you argue with those people? You must have replied a lot the whole morning.\u201dHe elbowed Huo Qu gently and said, \u201ccome on. Go to the window. Watch the sky and the birds to relax your eyes.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Huo Qu rejected his proposal, and then said with a serious tone, \u201cI have calculated it. Every reply saying that you are not that kind of person, about 13 people would turn to target at me. If they scold me, then they wouldn\u2019t have time for you.\u201dSuch silly motive and such silly action made Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes turn red in an instant.He tilted his head in case Huo Qi saw it, saying with a hoarse voice, \u201cbe good. Stop it. I will handle it.\u201dHardly had his voice faded away, Huo Qu stretched out a hand and held his head back gently.\u201cQinghuan,\u201d He lowered his head and looked right into his eyes, \u201cSorry. I am useless. I can\u2019t shut all those people\u2019s mouths. But I can share the burden with you at least.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want you to handle it alone. I also\u2026I also want to do something for you.\u201dYu Qinghuan nearly bit his lips to restrain his tears falling down, then asked Huo Qu, \u201caren\u2019t you angry with those who abuse you?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Huo Qu pursed his lips, showing a round little dimple on his left face, \u201cI don\u2019t care what they say.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t care, why would you try to explain for me?\u201d\u201cThey can abuse me, but not you.\u201dThe overwhelming touching feeling devoured his heart. Yu Qinghuan finally lost control and held Huo Qu\u2019s waist tightly. This was the first time he showed his weak side to someone.For tens of years, no one had ever been so good to him.Only this time, he wanted to yield himself up to release his weakness, and meanwhile, enjoy this hard-won care.Yu Qinghuan closed his eyes and then pressed his face against Huo Qu\u2019s warm chest. There was a moment that he had a feeling that he feared nothing as long as this person was with him.\u201dQinghuan\u2026\u201d Huo Qu\u2019s voice sounded from abover the head, \u201cSo\u2026did I help you now?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d It sounded like Huo Qu felt much relieved. After a pause, after cracking his brain to organize his words, Huo Qu said to Yu Qinghuan, \u201cQinghuan, I know I am different from normal people. I know nothing except physics and math. But\u2026can you give me some time? I can learn. Like how you protect me, I will also learn to protect you.\u201d\u201dNo.\u201d said Yu Qinghuan with thick nosal voice.\u201dQinghuan...\u201d Hearing his answer, Huo Qu felt his heart skipped a beat. When he was about to say something, Yu Qinghuan cut in.\u201cYou can already protect me.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201dYou don\u2019t need to change a bit, because you are already the best Huo Qu in the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if the two sides hated each other to a certain extent, at least in front of the public, they would show the appearance of good bros and good girlfriends. But Shen Ji\u2019s case set a precedent in the circleHis actions attracted numerous people to comment on his microblog, causing his Weibo followers to increase by 2 million over one night.Shen Ji grew dizzy with success, and he was more obedient to Xu Ning.Zhao Qingyuan followed this drama by chance while filming. His nose was crooked with anger. However, he was always a person who would not submit to humiliation and would let out his temper. Therefore, he hid from his agent and confronted Shen Ji on Weibo.Zhao Qing Yuan v: @ Shen Ji, Have some self-respect, dude! Want to humiliate Qinghuan to elevate yourself? What a daydream!When this microblog was posted, it immediately mixed up the already muddy water.[What the Fuck! Why did Dayuan join in the battle? I suddenly feel the gossip between him and Yu Qinghuan is not false...][Zhao Qingyuan is also a bad egg! Is it possible that the sugar daddy behind Yu Qinghuan is him?][Interesting, he is bullying Shen Ji because the latter does not have a strong background. That Yu Qinghuan is really a green tea bitch. He dare not confront Shen Ji, so he let his sugar daddy step forward to speak for him.]\u2026These vicious comments made Zhao Qingyuan even more furious. He meant to send a microblog to support Yu Qinghuan. But now, he really wanted to pull up his sleeves and got into a fight with those network mobs.Zhao Qing Yuan V: Yes. I\u2019m bullying him. You got a problem? Come and bully me since you are so capable! Btw, Qinghuan is my good friend so I have no hesitation to help him. Is it wrong? You can also enjoy this privilege if you have the ability to be my friend! [Doge][Wait... why do I feel... our Dayuan seems to gain much in masculinity this time. Is it my illusion or what?][You are not the only one. Who did he learn this sarcastic tongue from?][Shame on you! Your family is rich. So what? I don\u2019t believe you can hoodwink the public in the entertainment circle!][ Support my Dayuan! Mua! Who do you want to diss? I\u2019ll be the first to help you!][ Zhao Qingyuan and Yu Qinghuan\u2019s fans, please have some virtue and save yourselves some face! I\u2019m just waiting to see you get your face slapping!]\u2026Shen Ji didn\u2019t expect Zhao Qingyuan to join the war. He put down his cell phone in full head sweat while cursing Zhao a mental derangement in his heart.Good friends? So what? In the entertainment circle, who did not have a good friend! However, for the sake of friends, he ignored his personal image and indiscriminately scolded others like a shrew. Wasn\u2019t this kind of behavior insane? Even if Zhao himself was discredited, everyone had never seen him so radical!Although Shen Ji dared to defame Yu Qinghuan, he did not have the nerve to annoy Zhao Qingyuan. Therefore, he could only silently swallow his anger. The second microblog showing his grievance could only be stored in his draft box.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Zhao Qingyuan, he is a mad dog.\u201d Xu Ning frowned and told Shen Ji, \u201cDon\u2019t provoke him for a moment of anger. From now on, don\u2019t send anything. Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s aggressive appearance will definitely make the public feel more sympathy for you.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Shen Ji replied bitterly.\u201cTidy up your emotions,\u201d Xu Ning said, reaching out to help him carry the suitcase. \u201cSpread more powder on your face. Later I\u2019m gonna take you to the film crew. You must show them that you are trying to force a smile.\u201dShen Ji was going to play a part in a new TV series. Today was the day to join the film crew.\u201cOkay.\u201d Hearing this, Shen Ji nodded. He was determined to win sympathy from the public.Sure enough, just like what Xu Ning said, Zhao Qingyuan did not help Yu Qinghuan to recover his inferior position but instead gave Shen Ji the favorable impression of many passers-by.\u201cZhao Qingyuan and Yu Qinghuan are so gross. They are simply tumor of the entertainment circle! The atmosphere in the circle has been brought down by these two!\u201d\u201cHehe! How many times do you think Yu Qinghuan has slept with him before Zhao Qingyuan obeys him?\u201d\u201cThis ass seller is still a little star excluded from the mainstream after so many efforts!\u201d\u2026Yu Qinghuan originally wanted to wait until Yu Xin\u2019s investigation results came out before posing an explanation. However, seeing Zhao Qingyuan being cursed by those netizens, he had to open Weibo that he had not used for a long time.Yu Qinghuan V: Are you all tired of quarreling? I\u2019ll offer you a cup of tea and please listen to me while drinking. First, regarding Shen Ji\u2019s change of his agent, Yu Xin and I were the last to know until the whole process was completed. Second, regarding my sugar daddy, I am lazy and seldom post microblogs to explain it. If there really is sugar daddy out there, I think I will only eat and die at home and will not work so hard outside. Finally, Qingyuan is a good friend of mine. A person who can do anything for his friend regardless of his status should not be splashed with dirty water like this. What do you think?As soon as this microblog was posted, the two parties that had been quarreling fiercely ceased the fire surprisingly.[I don\u2019t know why, I suddenly don\u2019t want to blame Zhao Qingyuan now... ][ Me too\u2026 I always feel Yu Qinghuan is a very rational, calm and intelligent person, I must have made a mistake... ][ I suddenly envy the friendship between Yu Qinghuan and Zhao Qingyuan... ]Some people became more rational while others became more drastic.[ Bah! He still dares to post a microblog!? It\u2019s true that shameless people are invincible. ][ LOL, he said they were the last to know? Since he has such superb acting skills, why hasn\u2019t he won the best actor? ][ He is indeed an actor and he acts much better what he does!]\u2026Yu Qinghuan\u2019s reply pushed the drama to its climax. When Zhao Qingyuan saw this microblog, he immediately called Yu Qinghuan, \u201cAre you stupid? I wish I could settle this matter myself. What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s foolish of you to fight with them and refuse to admit defeat.\u201dZhao Qingyuan, \u201c...\u201dZhao Qingyuan took a deep breath, silently reciting \u201cYu Qinghuan was a patient\u201d three times in his heart. Then he smiled, \u201cYu Qinghuan, with such a sharp tongue, it\u2019s no wonder you don\u2019t have any girlfriend or even boyfriend!\u201d\u2026\u201cOh,\u201d said Yu Qinghuan faintly, \u201cAlthough your tongue is so smooth, you do not have a girlfriend, either.\u201dZhao Qingyuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe was silent for a long time and growled, \u201cI deserve it meddling with your fucking business!\u201d Then he hung up the phone.Yu Qinghuan touched his nearly deafened ear, put down his cell phone and climbed back into bed silently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was said that there was a problem with his laboratory, which could only be solved by him. Yu Xin was also busy outside. Yu Qinghuan felt bored alone in the ward, but he didn\u2019t like playing with his cell phone, so he simply closed his eyes and planned to have a unprotected sleep.Yu Qinghuan just had his fever abated and his body was still a little weak. He slept through the night. It was not until the nurse came to take his temperature did he be woken up.Fortunately, the temperature did not rise again. Yu Qinghuan breathed a sigh of relief and sent the nurse away. When he was preparing to get some hot water to drink., the ward door was pushed open with a bang which gave him a jump scare and he nearly dropped the cup in his hand.\u201cGe, what\u2019s so rush?\u201d Yu Qinghuan helplessly raised his head and looked at Yu Xin and asked.\u201cQinghuan~~~\u201d Yu Xin\u2019s face was flushed with excitement. When he spoke, his tail sound almost quivered into wavy lines, arousing Yu Qinghuan\u2019s goosebumps.\u201cGe, could you please act a little normal? What on earth is going on?\u201d\u201cLook at Weibo!\u201d Yu Xin took out his cell phone from his pocket and handed it to Yu Qinghuan. His hands were shaking, \u201cXu Ning was interviewed by reporters! He has exposed all Shen Ji\u2019s scandals.\u201d\u201cHa?\u201d Yu Qinghuan took the phone in disbelief and immediately fell silent after browsing the news.At noon today, on the way to send Shen Ji to the film crew, Xu Ning had a car accident together with Shen Ji on the highway. Shen Ji\u2019s face was destroyed while Xu Ning paid the price of two legs.When he learned that he was disabled for the rest of the life, Xu Ning went crazy. He blamed Shen Ji for everything. He felt that if he hadn\u2019t become Shen Ji\u2019s agent, he wouldn\u2019t have followed him to the film crew and naturally wouldn\u2019t have had this car accident.The more Xu Ning thought about it, the more he hated Shen Ji. After the reporters swarmed into the hospital, he told them everything, from Shen Ji went to see him to how Shen Ji asked to change his agent\u2026From that Shen Ji had long been dissatisfied with Yu Xin, to how Shen Ji slandered Yu Qinghuan. Now everything was revealed word for word! He even took out a recording of his conversation with Shen Ji from his mobile phone.Xu Ning was shrewd and had a strong desire of controlling. In addition, he had done a lot of wicked things. He always left himself a way out in case of anything bad happened to him.With such ironclad proof, Shen Ji could never justify for himself even if he had a hundred mouths.What\u2019s more, the current Shen Ji was unable to top these as his priorities. He learned that his face had been destroyed and that the best cosmetic techniques could not repair it. So he had totally collapsed now!If Xu Ning had not turned the steering wheel to the left as hard as he could at the moment of the accident, pushing all the danger to Shen Ji\u2019s side, how would his face be destroyed!?Shen Ji\u2019s anger reached its peak after seeing Xu Ning\u2019s interview.Despite his injured face, he also accepted the interview. He said indignantly that whether it was to change agents or to guide the public to abuse Yu Qinghuan, all the incidents were Xu Ning\u2019s idea.For a while, the two were extremely busy slandering each other. It was like dog biting dog.The public was originally scolding Yu Qinghuan. Seeing the interviews of the two men, they were immediately shocked to their chins dropped by the twist.What? Yu Qinghuan and Yu Xin actually did not know about the changing of agent?It meant this matter was planned by Xu Ning and Shen Ji all alone? They even used another two innocent people?Were these two people treating the public as fools?A few days ago, there were still comments scolding Yu Qinghuan. Now, the spectators all felt shameful. They flocked in Yu Qinghuan and Zhao Qing Yuan\u2019s Weibo for a sincere apology, and then they angrily hurled abuse at Xu Ning and Shen Ji.How could there be such shameless people!?It was obvious that they did something shameful, but they let the victims take the blame. If it hadn\u2019t been for this car accident, they might have succeeded!Shen Ji\u2019s fans were also shocked. They never expected their beloved idol to do such despicable things. They clamored to abandon their idol and joined the public to scold him.The Internet suddenly became extremely lively, almost like the Chinese New Year. Weibo\u2019s traffic even reached an all-time high because of this incident.Yu Qinghuan put down his cell phone in silence, unable to describe how he felt. On one hand, he felt much relieved, on the other hand, he felt a little bit sad.In the previous life, Yu Xin tried his best to protect Shen Ji\u2019s face, but he was treated like that by the other party. In this life, Shen Ji\u2019s face was completely destroyed because of the absence of Yu Xin, and Shen could no longer stay in the entertainment circle.This was probably the seed planted in the previous life and the fruit harvested in this life.\u201cI\u2019m gonna live on this joke all through the year,\u201d Yu Xin laughed brilliantly and all his fat meat quivered with joy. \u201cBitches would finally be punished by heaven. How come it\u2019s such a coincidence?

He just wanted to say yes, but it seemed like he suddenly remembered something and suddenly widened his eyes.With a thud and a swallow of saliva, Yu Xin walked straight ahead of Yu Qinghuan\u2019s puzzled eyes and bowed respectfully to him.Yu Qinghuan, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dYu Xin hissed at him mysteriously and whispered, \u201cSilence! I\u2019m worshipping the koi!\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c...\u201dAfter Yu Xin bowing to him three times, Yu Qinghuan said helplessly, \u201cGe. Could you rest assured now?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me Ge!\u201d Yu Xin corrected him solemnly, \u201cI will call you Ge in the future!\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c...\u201dYu Qinghuan suddenly had an urge to change his agent.The author has something to say:This is actually a story about the seeds planted in the previous life and the fruits harvested in this life.

I don\u2019t know how many people I have mistakenly dissed on internet. I feel very regretful now. Here I will say sorry to those I have wronged.]\u2026When those netizens were reflecting on themselves, a few majors of Yu Qinghuan\u2019s Alma Mater Hua Univ. had already planned to select cyber-violence as a topic of the thesis.As the No. 1 century-old college, Hua Univ. was sagacious and massive. It didn\u2019t speak a word on this thing, but chose this way to support those kids who had ever learned in here silently.As the only celebrity who had spoken for Yu Qinghuan in this big drama, Zhao Qingyuan immediately received tons of praise from those netizens. They even gave him a title Chinese Good Dude and got over 2 million followers in a short time on Weibo.If it had been before, Zhao Qingyuan would certainly feel mad with joy and show off on Weibo. But this time, he just gave it a sardonic grin and put down his phone. He said nothing, instead, he decided not to update his Weibo so frequently from now on.Only an apology and this is over? Such falsehearted apology and praise, he would accept neither.\u201cDad, things are over.\u201d In the office, Huo Rong was giving his dad a call, \u201cdon\u2019t you ever say that I don\u2019t listen to you. This time I totally stayed out of it. Besides, I also told my underlings to stay out of it. So? Are you happy this time?\u201dAfter a pause, he asked wonderingly, \u201cdad, do you have a problem with Yu Qinghuan?\u201dBy rights, Yu Qinghuan is his third\u2019s son\u2019s best friend. Shouldn\u2019t Huo Family help him in the first place? But on the contrary, his father told him to stay out of it and even watched this drama as a bystander.Even if this person is his own father, Huo Rong thinks it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201cRong,\u201d his father ignored his question and asked him instead, \u201cdo you think it\u2019d do Yu Qinghuan any good if you step in?\u201dHuo Rong answered without thinking, \u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cWhat good?\u201d His father asked bitterly, \u201cYou can help him once, you can help him twice, but can you watch what the netizens say about him all the time and help him for his whole life? He belongs to the entertainment circle. So such things are not rare. If he doesn\u2019t learn how to deal with it himself, what about in the future?\u201dHuo Rong got a little confused, \u201cDad, so you are tempering him? Then how do you think of his way dealing with it this time?\u201dHis father heaved a sigh, \u201cAt first he could keep his equanimity, but finally he lost control. The whole thing is Shen Ji and his agent\u2019s fault, but anyway Shen Ji is a B-list celebrity. What about Yu Qinghuan on the other hand? He is only a newcomer in this circle and directly confronted Shen Ji on Weibo. Does he really think the netizens would buy what he said and touched by what he said?\u201d\u201cZhao Qinghuan has the right to be unruly, but not him.\u201dAfter a pause, he made the conclusion, \u201cHe still needs experience and toughening. I meant to let him taste the bitterness of frustration through this thing and let him know every circle has its own unspoken rules and then solve the problem for him. But he was really lucky. Shen Ji had a car accident\u2026Forget it. Take things easy.\u201dHe had three sons he didn\u2019t care at all, but had time and energy to care about other\u2019s kid? Huo Rong was kind of jealous, \u201cyou really take Yu Qinghuan as your half-son?\u201d\u201cRong,\u201d His father said sternly, \u201cWithout Yu Qinghuan, Qu wouldn\u2019t have the big changes now. He has no parents. Your mother and I have raised up three sons, we don\u2019t mind raising one more. For my own kids, I never dote on any of you. The one I will dote on would always be other\u2019s kid.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Huo Rong shrugged and learned to speak with the tone his father used, \u201cThen I also don\u2019t mind having another younger brother.\u201d\u201cInvite him here this Spring Festival. One person\u2019s Spring Festival is not complete.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After he was discharged from hospital, he went to the sales office of Yanhe Community with Yu Xin and bought a 125-square-meter real estate on 31th floor on full payment. Finally he had a nest of his own.About the decorating stuff, Yu Qinghuan only nailed the style he wanted and left all the rest to Yu Xin. He himself then went to the Grand Theatre every day and made a lot of friends there.He was here to learn but not steal other\u2019s job. So those casts in the Grand Theater apparently welcomed him. Except some small talks, they also taught him a lot of useful acting techniques.This was a chance he even hadn\u2019t got in his previous life. So Yu Qinghuan made full use of every minute to absorb all the knowledge like a sponge absorbing water.Finally even Wang Zhensheng had to admit that he had made rapid progress.\u201cLook at you. Why do you go to the theater every day?\u201d Yu Xin looked his own celebrity and said grumpily.Since Shen Ji\u2019s drama, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s popularity had greatly increased. As a normal person, shouldn\u2019t he receive more endorsements and scripts now? Why would his own celebrity would choose such an unusual way? Why would he choose to accumulate his acting skills? Maybe after he learnt enough, he would already flop again!Yu Xin threw a stack of scripts in front of him and said bitterly, \u201cThese are the scripts I have collected for you. You read them now and then choose one! The Line of Life and Death will be released in the summer movie season. How to Love You will shot at least in July or August. There are nearly six months between. So you must take advantage of it and shoot at least one film.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Yu Qinghuan picked up the scripts and started to leaf through one by one.Seeing Qinghuan finally drowned himself in it, Yu Xin pinched his fat belly and exhaled a long breath of relief.A celebrity with koi\u2019s luck but didn\u2019t know how to cherish it was really something annoying!Those scripts Yu Xin selected for him were mostly good quality, among which there was even a blockbuster he had acted in in his previous life. The only difference was he acted as the third male lead last time, but this time the director wanted him to try the second male lead!To take the route he had taken in his previous life was kind of meaningless. So Yu Qinghuan directly put this script aside and opened the last one.The moment he read it, he got deeply hooked.The movie was called Orange, which told a story how a little girl\u2019s elder brother found out the rapist, sent him to jail and helped his sister walk out the shade after she got raped.It was at a cracking pace and the plots were cliff-hanging. With a good crew, it\u2019d definitely be a masterpiece.Yu Qinghuan looked at the director and scriptwriter and found it was the same person. But it was strange that in his previous life, he had never heard of such a talented guy.\u201cGe, contact Zhao Rui for me.\u201d Yu Qinghuan pointed at the name on the script, \u201cI\u2019ll take this one.\u201d\u201cWho is Zhao Rui?\u201d Yu Xin was a little confused and then looked at the name. After quite some time, he still couldn\u2019t recall a director called Zhao Rui.\u201cThis is weird.\u201d Yu Xin muttered to himself, then stretched out for the script Orange. After checking other scripts, he patted the back side of his head, \u201cI remember it! I picked this script out before! Why did it appear here?\u201d\u201cMaybe destiny, I guess?\u201d said Yu Qinghuan with a light smile, \u201cI think this movie is not bad. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\u201cQinghuan, my ancestor!\u201d Yu Xin was a little anxious, 'such genre is too heavy. Few people would love it! You can search movies of the same genre. Few have received over 100 million box-office. Besides, it may not get approved.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Yu Qinghuan said flatly, \u201cWhether its plot or its pace, it\u2019s all very good. I got hooked. Anyway I\u2019m only a newcomer. No one would judge me even if the box-office flops.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Yu Xin nodded. Any movie star with a little fame wouldn\u2019t shoot such a movie with too much uncertainty. But it suited someone like Yu Qinghuan very much.After he said that, he realized he got led by the nose again. But since Yu Qinghuan liked the script so much, he could only accept it reluctantly.Never mind! He is only a C-list star. Just let him! When he becomes famous someday, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do things as he likes like now.Yu Qin then went to contact Zhao Rui. While on the side in the Grand Theatre, on seeing the rehearsal of the last scene finished, Yu Qinghuan stood up and went out. When he put on his mask and was about to go home, he suddenly caught sight of the south gate of Hua Univ..Huo Qu had ever told him that his working site was in the technology building not far from the south gate of Hua Univ.. After thinking for a bit, Yu Qinghuan walked toward the technology building.It was really a coincidence. The moment Yu Qinghuan walked to the sentry box, he saw the Huo Qu was saying goodbye to his colleagues.\u201cProfessor Huo, bye bye.\u201d\u201cProfessor Huo, see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cProfessor Huo, you forgot your phone. Here!\u201d\u2026In front of Huo Huo, the faces of all those prestigious people were written with all respect.Huo Qu nodded to all those people one by one seriously. When he was about to hop into the car and go home, he got a glimpse of Yu Qinghuan not far away.His eyes immediately shone, and he quickly ran towards him.Other professors, \u201c\u2026\u201dThey must have opened their eyes with the wrong way today! How is it possible that serious and bland professor Huo becomes like this? Is there any unknown matter on that young man? Can they have a study\u2026Apparently Huo Qu had no idea what his colleagues were thinking. He asked Qinghuan excitedly, \u201cQinghuan, what are you doing here? Are you here for me?\u201d\u201cHm,\u201d Yu Qinghuan smiled, \u201cI come to pick you up.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll go with you!\u201d said Huo Qu. Like afraid that Yu Qinghuan might go without him, he immediately ran to Yu Qinghuan\u2019s side after informing his driver.Yu Qing laughed in spite of himself. When he was about to go, Huo Qu grabbed his wrist.He turned his head and asked, \u201cwhat?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026is for you.\u201d Huo Qu twitched his lips shyly, then took out a pair of gloves from his bag. He explained while putting them on for Qinghuan unhandily.Yu Qinghuan lowered his head and watched him put on the gloves for him slowly, feeling kind of complicated.The first time he saw Huo Qu, Huo Qu even didn\u2019t know how to cross the road, only stood in the middle of the road dully, and wouldn\u2019t ask other\u2019s help stubbornly. But now Huo Qu even knew how to care about others.\u201cQinghuan, are they warm?\u201d asked Huo Qu carefully. After a pause, he lowered his voice like he was muttering to himself, \u201cI specially bought them for you. They should be warm, right?\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d Yu Qinghuan moved his wholly wrapped hands a bit and then raised his head and said to Huo Qu, \u201cThey are quite warm.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026that\u2019s great!\u201d Huo Qu felt his ears burning, and then showed that round little dimple on his left face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)Translator: Guy Gone BadYu Qinghuan took Huo Qu to a beef noodle restaurant before taking him home.The beef noodles here tasted good. After eating once, Yu Qinghuan already fancied it. So he would come at intervals.\u201cHere.\u201d He pushed a bowl of noodles covered with larges pieces of beef on the surface, saying with a smile, \u201chave a try.\u201dHuo Qu nodded and picked up the chopsticks.He was still not used to chopsticks. He tried to pick up the noodles with it again and again awkwardly, but still didn\u2019t eat a single noodle. He could only twitch his nose there.Yu Qinghuan thought he looked funny and super cute this way, like a white soft bunny, making him have an impulse to bully him. Instead of helping Huo Qu, he held his chin with his hands and stared at him, until Huo Qu\u2019s face turned all red and nearly couldn\u2019t hold his chopsticks.Darn! Huo Qu thought he fell sick again!Every time Qinghuan looked at him with a smile like this, he\u2019d have difficulty in breathing and even feel a little dizzy.His Adam\u2019s apple moved up and down. Then in order to avoid his staring, Huo Qu involuntarily lowered his head and drank a big mouthful of the soup with a rush.The beef noodles were newly made. A thin layer of oil insulated the heat below. Though it was not steaming, the temperature below was pretty high. Huo Qu got burnt in the mouth and his tears immediately popped out.Yu Qinghuan got startled. He promptly stood up, leaned to his side and held his chin, asking with concern, \u201cOpen your mouth. Let me see how serious it gets burnt.\u201d Then he frowned, \u201cWhat was the rush? You hungry?\u201dHuo Qu shook his head, looked at him with tears in his eyes, and then opened his mouth obediently.The light in the restaurant was not good, plus Yu Qinghuan happened to back on to it. He could not see clearly. Having no choice, he could only lower his body and leaned closer to Huo Qu\u2019s face.Among Yu Qinghuan five sense organs, his eyes were extra outstanding, pupil extremely black and bright, with a thin moist layer, sparkling under the light, extremely beautiful and tempting.Huo Qu felt as if a rabbit was jumping in his chest, so strong as if the next moment it would jump out.And he felt dry and thirsty in his throat. Even he kept swallowing some saliva, it still wouldn\u2019t alleviate the symptoms.And a strong impulse of touching and getting intimate with this person emerged from the bottom of his heart.And his eyes that were staring at Yu Qinghuan also became burning hot.\u201cYour tip of tongue turns red,\u201d Yu Qinghuan was so worried about Huo Qu that he even didn\u2019t notice the change of Huo Qu\u2019s expression, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether you got scald inside. I will take you\u2026What are you doing?\u201dYu Qinghuan dodged instinctively, looking at Huo Qu who stretched out his hands, with kind of weird expression on his face.Just now\u2026Huo Qu stretched out his hands to\u2026hit him? For that he just had a good laugh at him?On thinking of that, he flicked Huo Qu\u2019s forehead helplessly, \u201cYou little petty thing! I laughed at you and you want to get physical? Seems you didn\u2019t get burnt badly enough!\u201dSeeing Huo Qu sit there, didn\u2019t say anything, lips pursed, Yu Qinghuan thought he really pissed him off.So he could only bend over towards him, \u201cAll right, all right. It\u2019s my fault. I can\u2026\u201dBefore he finished his words, Huo Qu\u2019s warm fingers had already touched his eyes. Due the stimulation of external force, Yu Qinghuan closed his eyes by the light of nature.Even in the darkness, he heard what Huo Qu was muttering clearly.Huo Qu said, \u201cQinghuan, your eyes are even more beautiful than the stars in the sky.\u201dYu Qinghuan immediately felt a blow in his head and his heart instantly lost its pace.He murmured a few times \u201cHuo Qu knows nothing\u201d in his heart and managed to stabilize his wild state of mind.He felt a little guilty, brushed off Huo Qu\u2019s hand, pretending to be angry, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Eat your noodles.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Huo Qu felt a little wronged, then picked up his chopsticks with his head lowered disappointedly.So Qinghuan didn\u2019t like the way he described him\u2026\u201cHere.\u201d When he was still thinking, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s a little bit cold voice reached his ears. He raised his head and saw Y Qinghuan put the noodles into a small bowl and pushed it before him, \u201cEat. Don\u2019t get burnt this time. Eat your noodles first and then talk to me.\u201dYu Qinghuan used a very small bowl for dipping sauce, only half of a palm size. So even if Huo Qu didn\u2019t know how to use chopsticks, he would still be able to slip the noodles into his mouth with them.\u201dHuo Qu didn\u2019t know why. Looking at Yu Qinghuan who was still wearing that cold face, he didn\u2019t feel as nervous as just now.\u201cHm!\u201d He nodded his head heavily, then picked up that small bowl of noodles and dug a big mouthful.It is sweet!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2)Translator: Guy Gone BadAfter the meal, Yu Qinghuan planned to send Huo Qu home. But when he got up and put on the gloves, he suddenly thought of something. So he raised his head and asked, \u201cHave you ever bought gloves for anyone else?\u201dHuo Qu shook his head, confused, \u201cNo.\u201dSo all his families\u2019 hands weren\u2019t feeling cold?Knowing what he was thinking, Yu Qinghuan touched the gloves and said, \u201cUsually it\u2019s not that the one who receives a gift really needs it but the one who sends it wants to show his good intention.\u201dHuo Qi was a little confused, didn\u2019t get what he was trying to say.Yu Qinghuan could only put it in a simple way, \u201cLike you send me a scarf or a pair of socks or something like that, actually I may not really need them, but I would feel happy on thinking it is you who sends it to me.\u201dNow Huo Qu totally got what he meant.He then nodded and smiled shyly, \u201cThen I will buy them gloves.\u201dAlthough Huo Qu was like an invisible person at home, he could feel his family was all good to him. Before he had no idea what a present stood for. Thanks to Qinghuan, now he had learnt another great thing.Yu Qinghuan found a gift store nearby and chose four pairs of gloves for Huo Qu, and didn\u2019t leave until he sent Huo Qu to the gate of his community.When Huo Qu went in, the whole family was watching TV in the guest room. On hearing him, they all looked at him\u2026\u201cQu\u2019er, have you had some fun?\u201d\u201cWow, our Qu\u2019er also has a night life now.\u201d\u2026Huo Qu didn\u2019t get what they were talking about, so he only stood there saying nothing. Under the whole family\u2019s surprising eyes, he shuffled his bag and finally took out four pairs of gloves and handed each of them a pair from left to right.\u201cQu\u2019er, this is\u2026\u201d Mrs. Huo\u2019s hands were shaking and she raised his head to look at Huo Qu surprisingly, only afraid that she might mistake it. Even her breath became very careful.Huo Qu smiled, \u201cQinghuan said when you send gifts, the most important thing is not the gift itself, but the heart of the one who sends it. So I want you all to be happy.\u201dMrs. Huo covered her mouth and threw herself into Mr. Huo\u2019s arms, tears pouring from her eyes.For all these years, she had never been this happy.If possible, she\u2019d rather her son could be a common normal person, at least better than being a self-reclusive genius who knew nothing about life and the ways of the world.Fortunately now her son finally went back to normal slowly, which made her much relieved now.On the other hand, when Yu Qinghua just arrived home and opened the door, Yu Xin immediately dragged him in, \u201cMy god! Where have you been? You didn\u2019t answer my call! Didn\u2019t you know we had an appointment with director Zhao Rui? He has been waiting for you for a few hours!\u201dYu Qinghuan was a little surprised, \u201cMy phone was powered off. See director Zhao? Now?\u201dShouldn\u2019t both sides arrange when and where to meet first?\u201cYeah!\u201d Yu Xin gave him a push and then dragged him to the guest room, \u201cCome on! Say hi!\u201dOn seeing Zhao Rui, Yu Qinghuan got startled.This person was really too thin, one could even say he was a mere bag of bones.Hearing Yu Qinghuan was back, he managed to turn to his side, eyes darkened, like a dead pool.\u201cYu Qinghuan?\u201d asked Zhao Rui with a hoarse voice. After sizing Yu Qinghuan up and down, he then sneered, \u201cYou are not suitable.\u201dThis is the first time someone said he is not suitable on the first sight.Instead of being angry, he was a bit curious. So he sat next to Zhao Rui and asked, \u201cBut why, if I may ask?\u201d\u201cYour face\u2026\u201d Zhao Rui lowered his eyes, \u201cEven with very heavy makeup, you still don\u2019t look like a big brother who worries about his sister.\u201dYu Qinghuan\u2019s heart skipped a beat because he immediately got what the director was saying.An elder brother who took his sister as a treasure would look gaunt and decadent after knowing such a thing happened to his sister. While he, on the contrary, looked healthy and lively, which was the biggest barrier if he acted in this movie.Knowing he understood why, Zhao Rui continued, \u201cSince you have seen the script, you can try a scene.\u201d Speaking of which, he opened the script and picked a scene randomly.Yu Qinghuan lowered his head and saw it happened to be the scene the elder brother Zhao Qingping was told his eight-year-old Zhao Qing\u2019an got raped.Although there were only a few lines, Yu Qinghuan knew it wasn\u2019t easy to act it well.Zhao Qingping must be angry, distressed and desperate, but since his little sister was still in the operation room, he could only have to suppress all his emotions.The suppressing, controlling and changing of emotions was a big challenge for an actor\u2019s acting skills.He took a deep breath, brewing his emotions with eyes lowered. When he raised his head again, it seemed he had totally changed to another person.The muscles of his face were horribly twisted with great rage, gnashing his teeth, and his eyes were filled with incisive hatred and despair.His sister, who was only eight years old, had been subjected to such cruelty and now was still in ICU!What should she do after waking up? How to face the world in the future? Is it possible she would still be that lively and cute girl?A string of questions nearly drove him crazy. Now he was like a cornered beast, eyes reddened, risking its life to find a way out.But when his eyes focused on one point, all the madness was swept away in a moment.Zhao Rui heard Yu Qnghuan tried to suppress and restrain his voice,\"Anan, be good. Don't be afraid. I swear I will find that person and send him to jail!!\"His eyes instantly turned red.\"Ok.\" He raised a hand to interrupt Qinghuan\u2019s performance, saying with a bland voice, \"I have brought the contract, we can sign it up right away. But for the record, I'm poor, so I won\u2019t pay you much, and the film production cycle is at most one and a half months, so you know, working intensity. First you have to make sure that you can accept all these conditions.\"\"Ok.\" Yu Qinghuan nodded without hesitation.Nearly two months of high-intensity work, just to cover the Spring Festival. Even speding it with the filming crew would be better than one person.The two hit it off, immediately signed the contract, which totally startled Yu Xin who was standing aside.When he came to his sense, he immediately grabbed the contract. When he caught a glimpse of the six-figure remuneration, he nearly blacked out on spot if he hadn\u2019t been under the support of his thick layer of fat.850 thousand! Pre-tax!Even Yu Qinghuan was only a newcomer. This price was too deceptive!Yu Xin was now like a bloating puffer, saying to Zhao Rui in a huff, \u201cDirector Zhao, since you are so frugal. Why don\u2019t you both director and act yourself! Your image is totally suited to the role!\u201dOn hearing him, Zhao Rui glanced at him, \u201cI want to, but I\u2019m afraid I can never express the feeling about warmth for my whole life.\u201dYu Xin was surprised and muttered to himself, \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201dZhao Rui lowered his eyes, \u201cMy little sister is the prototype of the girl in the script. The only difference is she died.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Urgh\u2026do you think whether I should give him a call to apologize?\u201dHe never expected Orange was adapted from Zhao Rui\u2019s personal experience. He thought Zhao Rui was pretending to be a decadent man to catch up with the trend. If he had known about this earlier, he would never make jokes on his painful memory.\u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d Yu Qinghuan comforted him, \u201cyou weren\u2019t on purpose. Zhao Rui wouldn\u2019t put it on mind.\u201dAfter a pause, seeing Yu Xin\u2019s face was still written with guilt, he then said, \u201cIf this is really something he can never touch, he would never adapt it to a script and even shoot it into a film.\u201dThis immediately brightened Yu Xin, \u201cYou are right. I\u2019m really so silly.\u201dYu Qinghuan poured him a glass of hot water, pushed it to his side, then tried to skip this topic, \u201cGe, go find me a dietician. I wanna lose some weight.\u201d\u201cQinghuan, are you really gonna do it?\u201d Yu Xin was still a bit worried, \u201cWe still have no idea whether it could be released.\u201dSince the Orange crew was short of money, and they would start shooting next week, Yu Qinghuan really had no much time. To lose so much weight in such a short time would bring irreparable damage to his body.Yu Xin heaved a sigh. If possible, he really didn\u2019t want Yu Qinghuan to hurt himself for a movie.\u201cI know what I am doing. I won\u2019t lose too much weight.\u201d Yu Qinghuan patted the tea table, saying while still thinking, \u201cIn the former half of the month, it wouldn\u2019t be so strict with my image. So it reserves me three weeks\u2019 time, during which I plan to lose eight jin. It should be no big problem.\u201dYu Qinghuan actually was already pretty thin. If he could lose another eight jin, it would very obvious. With the help of special effects makeup, it would be enough for him to play Zhao Qingping.He made a pause, then turned to Yu Xin and said with a serious tone, \u201cGe, since I already decided to take it, I should be responsible for it.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d Since he had already made up his mind, Yu Xin knew it was no use arguing. He then went to find him the dietician.Yu Qinghuan meant to stay with Zhao Rui for a few days before the shooting, so he could have a better understanding of the script and his own role. But Ada\u2019s call ruined his plan.Because of the incident about Shen Ji, Yu Qinghuan was still hot on the internet. So Evenson decided to strike while the iron is hot, to release the news that Yu Qinghuan would be the new spokesman of their abstinent series watch ahead of schedule.Thus, Yu Qinghuan had to lay down everything at hands and went to shoot the commercial for Ada first.Fortunately Ada had worked in extra hours to work out the commercial project. Thanks to the experience in his previous life, when facing the camera, Yu Qinghuan performed pretty good, which even won the cameraman\u2019s praises.Only two days, the commercial had been finished and was released on Ada\u2019s official Weibo in the first place.In the first photo, Yu Qinghuan wore a total black suit. His hand rose slightly, perfectly exposing the watch with silvery white watch-face around his wrist. That kind of breathtaking beauty of white and black weaving together could catch one\u2019s eyes on the first sight.In the second photo, he sat on a dark sofa, wearing a crimson shirt few people would wear in commercials. He put his hand wearing the watch on his chin that was slightly raised. He looked both abstinent and noble.After seeing those photos, all those netizens were amazed and praising his pretty face.[My god! I am dead! How could Qinghuan\u2019s wrist be so pretty?! Ah!!! And the watch is also pretty!][Ah!!! It kills me! I decide to buy one for my boyfriend! So damn pretty! Don\u2019t you feel that you have that kind of indescribable impulse on Yu Qinghuan wearing that watch?]\u201cSo goddamn cool!! I have been not so into Ada\u2019s products! I always think their design is too mature and dense. But this time it Amwayed me! I got hooked!][Wow! Wow! Wow! The price of this series is pretty beautiful! Eating a month\u2019s instant noodles, maybe I can afford one! But I \u2018ve got a question! Will they offer Qinghuan\u2019s poster if I buy a watch? I\u2019ll buy one if they do.][Totally agreed.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He glared at Evenson, \u201cYou tricked me?!\u201dFang Zhongxi had a bland face. Now his eyes turning red, and he looked very wronged but still held it there, which immediately turned Evenson on. It seemed that he didn\u2019t see Fang Zhongxi\u2019s angry eyes at all. He stretched out a hand and pulled him into his arms. He then teased by his ears, \u201cBaby, you mistake me. I have never promised you anything.\u201dEvenson was a total playboy. For him, all is fish that comes to the net. Even he himself had no idea how many men he had slept with. But no one had ever been so attractive to him like Fang Zhongxi. He even thought he was pretty even when he lost his temper.\u201cFuck off!\u201d Fang Zhongxi pushed him away hard. He then had a hard bite of the tip of his tongue to prevent himself from breaking down, \u201cEvenson, you will get your karma!\u201dNow the smile on Evenson\u2019s face was totally gone, not because of his curse, but the disgusting expression on his face.He knew that Fang Zhongxi was not into men and even often insulted him on this when doing it.Straight? So what? He was still his toy in bed!As for how Fang Zhongxi felt, he didn\u2019t give it a shit at all. It was only a moment\u2019s joy. After it, they were total strangers.But now when Fang Zhongxi looked him with that expression, Evenson suddenly felt chest stuffiness. He could barely breathe.\u201cWho gave you the guts?\u201d He pinched Fang Zhongxi\u2019s chin hard, \u201cYou are just a whore.\u201dFang Zhongxi\u2019s body shivered. After quite a while, he brushed Evenson\u2019s hand off and said coldly, \u201cYou said I am a whore? Did you pay me? I whored the design director of Ada. I\u2019m so goddamn lucky!\u201dThen he turned around and was about to leave.The moment he took a step, Evenson grabbed his wrist. His voice sounded calm, but mixed with undisguised anger, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m gonna find someone who would afford to pay me!\u201dEvenson sneered, \u201cYou are really a bitch! You can\u2019t live without men for even one day! Well, you don\u2019t have to. Don\u2019t you want the endorsement of Chirly\u2019s windbreaker series? Stay with me for another month and I can get it for you. What do you say?\u201d\u201cAre you taking me as a fool? They have already nailed their spokesman?\u201d Fang Zhongxi swung his wrist, trying to get rid of him, but failed. He then said while panting, \u201cYou wanna trick me again? No way!\u201d\u201cTrust me!\u201d said Evenson with a deep voice, \u201cI chose Yu Qinghuan as the spokesman of our watch is because I owe Huo Rong. As for Chicly, if you want it, it is yours. Just a lousy brand. Only someone like you would want it so badly.\u201dHuo Rong!?Fang Zhongxi\u2019s whole body shook. No wonder Ada would choose Yu Qinghuan! So it was Huo Rong behind him!Isn\u2019t Yu Qinghuan pure and lofty? Doesn\u2019t he look down on him? Actually they have no difference!But, why is he always so lucky? Now he even rode on Huo Rong\u2019s coattails! While he himself\u2026he looked at Evenson right before his eyes! Why would he have to sell his ass to this idiot?\u201cSo what do you say?\u201d asked Evenson disdainfully while rotating the mobile phone in his hand casually.Fang Zhongxi then closed his eyes. He wanted to slap Evenson right in the face and then get out of here. But\u2026he can\u2019t.After a short silence, he heard his own quiet but strange voice, \u201cI agree.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His recipe had been set. So these days he had to lose weight strictly following the requirements on it.Every time Yu Xin saw him eat such little food, he felt like Yu Qinghuan was self-abusingYu Qinghuan was only in his twenties when he had enormous appetite. But he only ate so little every meal, even a saint couldn\u2019t bear it. What he couldn\u2019t think through was Orange was special-interest everybody could tell. Even it was lucky enough to be released, few people would go to the theatre to watch it.Life is already a mess in reality. No one doesn\u2019t want to relax in the theater. How would they choose such a depressive movie? For such a movie that was an absolute failure, is it really worth it?\u201cEat some more,\u201d Yu Xin pushed his own food before him. He knew the dietician made the recipe for him, there would be no problem. But he still couldn\u2019t bear it, \u201cIf you keep on like this, you would already break down before the shooting. It doesn\u2019t matter to eat some more for one or two meals.\u201dYu Qinghuan didn\u2019t even look at those delicate dishes. He just kept digging his own salad, and said, \u201cNo need. Ge, you eat. I\u2019m fine.\u201dBefore Yu Qinghuan, Yu Xin had never seen a celebrity who had such strict self-control. They knew that they would look terrible in the camera if they were fat, but they still couldn\u2019t control their mouths.Only Yu Qinghuan kept his own words and did what he said, no discount!Sometimes one would also feel quite worried if his own kid was too dependent from him.Yu Xin heaved a sigh. He raised his head to catch a glimpse of Yu Qinghuan who already became thinner, and took those dishes to another room.On the fifth dieting day, Yu Qinghuan joined the shooting crew. Zhao Rui was really short of money. Such a low budget movie Orange was already a heavy burden for him. Yu Qinghuan\u2019s remuneration of 850 thousand was already his limit.All the facilities were very simple and Zhao Rui also had to wear many hats. Even the place they lived in was only some simple wooden makeshift houses built near the construction site.\u201cOh my god!\u201d Seeing rows of low and shabby wooden makeshift houses, Yu Xin jumped while patting his own forehead.This Zhao Rui really knew how to save money! He even suspected that whether Zhao Rui would ask those actors to prepare tents themselves if it had been summer now. So they could directly sleep on the filming site!\u201cQinghuan, come here.\u201d Yu Xin cleaned Yu Qinghuan\u2019s room roughly. He even had no time to clear up the luggage, but plugged in the electric blanket and said to Yu Qinghuan, \u201cGet in bed to warm yourself. This place is\u2026\u201dBefore he finished his words, the thin wooden door was blown open by the strong north wind, and, \u201cbang\u201d, it fell on his back.The piercingly cold air immediately burst into the room. Yu Xin couldn\u2019t help trembling. Having no time to care about his own back, he quickly turned around to shut the door while chattering, \u201cThis is horrible! This is horrible\u2026\u201d\u201cZhao Rui wants to see me later,\u201d Yu Qinghuan shook his head, then put on that pair of gloves Huo Qu sent him and said, \u201cGe , you go back later. There won\u2019t be too many things to take care of here. Doesn\u2019t my house need decorations? You take care of it for me.\u201d\u201cAll right. Then I gotta go. Call me if you need me.\u201d Yu Xin knew Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t want him to suffer here with him. So he accepted his good intention and drove his second-hand Audi to leave.After sending away Yu Xin, Yu Qinghuan planned to go to the filming site and look around. He met Zhao Rui at a corner, who looked in a good mood today because there was a big smile on his face which was rarely seen. Maybe because he hadn\u2019t smiled for too long, it was kind stiff, giving one goose bumps.\u201cBrother Rui,\u201d Yu Qinghuan said hello. When he was about to say something, he saw a little girl behind him. She was totally covered behind Zhao Rui, so Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t see her.This little girl looked about 6 or 7 years old, big eyes, curled hair, wearing a pink down jacket, so pretty like an angel.Yu Qinghuan immediately guessed it should be his little sister in the movie.Zhao Rui nodded as a response. Then he took a step back and introduced, \u201cThis is Wang Ruirui. She is playing Zhao Qing\u2019an.\u201dThen he turned to Wang Ruirui and his voice also became soft. He pointed at Yu Qinghuan, \u201cThis is Yu Qinghuan. He is playing your elder brother Zhao Qingping in the movie.\u201d\u201cHi, Ruirui. I\u2019m Yu Qinghuan. You can call me brother Qinghuan.\u201d Yu Qinghuan moved forward and squatted down before the little girl.It seemed Wang Ruirui was a little afraid of Zhao Rui, because she looked a little tense. But when facing Yu Qinghuan\u2019s handsome smiling face, she loosened up a lot and even smiled at Yu Qinghuan, \u201cBrother Qinghuan.\u201dThe little girls\u2019 voice was soft and cute, with that pair of big and watery eyes blinking at Yu Qinghuan, which immediately melted Yu Qinghuan\u2019s heart.He couldn\u2019t help stretching out a hand to rub her downy hat, \u201cAre you cold? Where is your room? I can take you there.\u201d\u201cShe lives in the hotel over there.\u201d Before Wang Ruirui answered him, Zhao Rui cut in, \u201cShe is too small. She can\u2019t live in the wooden house.\u201d\u201cYeah, a right decision.\u201d Yu Qinghuan nodded, showing he totally understood. Then he got up and wanted to send Zhao Ruirui to her room with Zhao Rui, but Zhao Rui turned him down, \u201cI can do it by myself.\u201dBefore Yu Qinghuan had any response, Zhao Rui already walked away holding Wang Ruirui\u2019s hand.It seemed Wang Ruirui really wanted to stay a bit longer with Yu Qinghuan. But seeing Zhao Rui\u2019s darkened face, she dare not say anything but went away with him.Watching the two gradually fade away, Yu Qinghuan heaved a sigh.Apparently Zhao Rui was sensitive of him trying to get close to Wang Ruirui. Maybe because his little sister\u2019s thing had left him tremendous psychological shadow, he was guarding against every grown man trying to get close with a little girl.Yu Qinghuan was not mad at it. He just felt sorry for him.He only hoped that Zhao Rui could finish this movie to fulfill his wish, then walk out of the shadows and live a normal life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though Zhao Rui never allowed her to be with Yu Qinghuan alone, she still went to Yu Qinghuan\u2019s side often whenever she got a chance.As result, when shooting, she really performed that kind of feeling a little sister to her elder brother, which was kind of happy surprise.Yu Qinghuan also liked Wang Ruirui. Although this little girl was young, she had acted in quite a few movies. So her acting skills were really not bad. The more precious thing was she also had good personalities. Even under such rough conditions, she never complained but only did whatever the director asked her to.When there wasn\u2019t her part, she would sit beside quietly, reading some fairy tale books or staring blandly alone.The only time she cried was that she fell over herself and shed some tears due the huge pains.After a whole day\u2019s shooting, Zhao Rui sent Wang Ruirui back to the hotel himself and then came back to pack the equipment.Instead of going back to his own room, Yu Qinghuan stayed to act as his assistant.\u201cBrother Rui, what is Ruirui\u2019s situation? She is out shooting a movie at such a young age. Why is there no one around taking care of her?\u201dSeeing Zhao Rui stop smoking, Yu Qinghuan finally couldn\u2019t hold it and ask the question which had confused him for a few days.On hearing him, Zhao Rui took a heavy puff of the smoke and snorted, \u201cThe day she joined the crew, her mother already couldn\u2019t wait discarding her to me.\u201dIt turned out not long after Wang Ruirui was born, her parents got divorced and soon had their own new families.As for wang ruirui, both sides don't want her, and they kicked her from one side to the other like a football. The reason Wang Ruirui came out shooting movies was mostly because her parents thought they could both make some money and stay away from their daughter.\u201cThose scumbags!\u201d swore Zhao Rui sullenly while gnashing the cigar.After hearing him, Yu Qinghuan also felt awful. They brought the kid into this world themselves. How could they do this to her? What\u2019s more, Wang Ruirui is so obedient and thoughtful.Sometimes this world is really cruel. He always wanted an intact family, while some didn\u2019t cherish it at all when they owned it.Since something was on his mind, after Yu Qinghuan fell asleep, he had a bizarre dream that night. Early the next morning, after washing his face with some cold water, he then came to himself.When he arrived at the shooting site, Zhao Rui was adjusting the monitor, while Wang Ruirui sat behind him, head lowered like she was thinking something.Yu Qinghuan noticed the little girl was a little down. So he went to her side and asked gently, \u201cRuirui, have you had breakfast?\u201dWang Ruirui nodded, still didn\u2019t raise her head.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Yu Qinghuan stretched out a hand and pushed the bangs covering her eyes aside over her hat, \u201cWhy bullies our little princess?\u201d\u201cBrother Qinghuan,\u201d Wang Ruirui sniffed and asked him with a very low voice, eyes red, \u201cAm I very annoying?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d Yu Qinghuan took out a White Rabbit (a candy brand), and removed the wrappers for her, \u201cRuirui is pretty and smart, and has wonderful acting skills. We all like you. How could you be annoying?\u201d\"But why neither my dad nor my mom wants me\u2026\u201d Wang Ruirui bit her lips, tears rustling down, \u201cThey only like my little brother\u2026\u201dYu Qinghuan heaved a sigh, saying while wiping the tears for her, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, or you won\u2019t look pretty.\u201d Then he held her up and put her on his knee, saying gently, \u201cIt\u2019s not your problem. Sometimes adults will also do some stupid things. Like Snow White you watched yesterday. There are also some people who don\u2019t like her. But you can\u2019t say she is not pretty or not kindhearted, right?\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d Wang Ruirui nodded heavily and finally melted into smiles. She then slipped into Yu Qinghuan\u2019s arms like a little bird and said, \u201cBrother Qinghuan, you are really nice.\u201dWhat an easily satisfied kid! Yu Qinghuan gently stroked her little head, feeling pitiful for her.Zhao Rui didn\u2019t give Yu Qinghuan much time to prepare. Soon he handed today\u2019s schedule to Yu Qinghuan and started to shoot one scene after another.Yu Qinghua was the male lead, so his shooting intensity was heavy. Seeing him nearly exhausted, even the working staff beside felt sorry for him. But Zhao Rui showed no mercy. He just shot as scheduled, leaving him no time to rest.Everyone in the crew was afraid of him. So no one dared to persuade him. Except Zhao Ruirui, Zhao Ruirui always wore that long face.Wang Ruirui was a precocious kid. Soon she noticed Zhao Rui looked horrible but actually doted on her and was always at her beck and call.Seeing Yu Qinghuan\u2019s face turn a little pale due to exhaustion, the little girl made an excuse saying she was tired and timidly asked Zhao Rui whether she could take some rest.\u201cOK.\u201d Zhao Rui didn\u2019t see her through, so he immediately agreed, forcing a stiff smile at her.\u201cThank you, uncle Zhao.\u201d After thanking him, the little girl immediately ran to Yu Qinghuan. She looked up at him, asked with a caring tone, \u201cBrother Qinghuan, are you exhausted?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Yu Qinghuan squatted down and looked at her gently, \u201cOur little princess is so sweet.\u201dWang Ruirui pursed her lips and then smiled shyly.Such a good kid! How could her parents be so coldhearted to abandon her?He thought he should be good to this kid, even it was only one and half months.As Zhao Rui said, it was really a \u2018short\u2019 break. Yu Qinghuan took a break and started the shooting again.In the movie Orange, his part took up as much as about 70%. So under the whole crew\u2019s sympathetic eyes, he became the poorest person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After taking a bath, he plunged into his bed and was about to sleep. But right after he closed his eyes, the phone rang.He struggled to stretch out a hand to get his phone, \u201cQingyuan?\u201dAt the other end of the phone, Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s voiced sounded extremely exciting. He was like a Husky that had been locked up for too long and finally had a chance to go out for a walk, \u201cQinghuan! My movie is wrapped up finally! Are you home? I\u2019m going to your place now!\u201d\u201cI just received a new movie.\u201d Yu Qinghuan sat up, trying to make himself sound not so exhausting, \u201cI\u2019m at the filming site.\u201d\u201cFuck!\u201d Zhao Qingyuan couldn\u2019t help swearing, \u201cYou are fast! Where do you shoot the movie? I\u2019ll go visit you.\u201dAfter telling him the site, Yu Qinghuan added, \u201cDon\u2019t you come. The condition here is not so good. There\u2019s even no place to sleep.\u201dZhao Qingyuan thought he was making an excuse not to let him come, so he was very unhappy and questioned him instead, \u201cThen where do you live?\u201dYu Qinghuan rubbed his frontalis and explained, \u201cI am now sleeping in the shack of a construction site, shabby and pretty cold, are you still coming?\u201dHe thought Zhao Qingyuan would give up on hearing it. But instead, he said excitedly, \u201cA shack? I have never seen one! You triggered my curiosity. Wait for me! I\u2019m going tomorrow.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dNever mind! As long as he is happy.The he said to Yu Qinghuan, \u201cBring me something when you come.\u201d After thinking for a while, he continued, \u201cBuy two headbands for me, I mean the cute kind.\u201dFor a normal person, one could tell Yu Qinghuan would want to send them to someone as a gift. But it happened Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s brain circuits were different form a normal person. On hearing that, he thought Yu Qinghuan wanted them for his own use.After a few seconds\u2019 silence, he tried to confirm, \u201cYou want headbands? Aren\u2019t they for girls?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Yu Qinghuan felt a little confused by his question. Shouldn\u2019t only girls use headbands? Does he have to ask again to confirm?\u201cOK. Got it.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan thought he really didn\u2019t understand those gays. Why would they use headbands? But still he promised with a kind of mixed feeling, \u201cYou can count on me. I will definitely pick the cutest ones.\u201dAfter hanging up, he patted his chest and screamed like he saw a ghost, \u201cMy god! I never expected Qinghuan has such a special hobby.\u201dThe next day Zhao Qingyuan got up early in the morning. He first went to the company to deal with some trivial things and then went to buy headbands for Yu Qinghuan. But not long after he went out, he came across Huo Rong.Huo Rong was speaking on the phone, looking a little embarrassed, \u201cI\u2019m going abroad later. I don\u2019t have time. If he really wants to see Yu Qinghuan, let the bodyguard send him. It\u2019s OK, mom. He won\u2019t get lost\u2026\u201dZhao Qingyuan moved forward and patted his shoulder. Huo Rong thought he got something, so he covered the receiver and turned to him, \u201cWhat is it, Qingyuan?\u201d\u201cYour little brother is going to see Qinghuan?\u201dSeeing Huo Rong nod, Zhao Qingyuan continued, \u201cWhat a coincidence! I\u2019m also going to Qinghuan\u2019s place later. What I about I give him a ride? So you parents would feel eased.\u201d\u201cI will be more worried if you drive him!\u201d thought Huo Rong in his heart.But he can\u2019t turn down his kindness directly. So he could only say, \u201cOK. You can go pick him up at home later. Call me in the first place if there is anything.\u201d After thinking he might be still on the plane at that time, he added, \u201cYou can also call Qinghuan.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan bragged, \u201cYou can count on me!\u201dWhen Zhao Qingyuan arrived at the filming site with Huo Qu, Yu Qinghuan just finished a scene and was restoring his strength leaning against a wall. On seeing him, Zhao Qinghuan popped his eyes out, \u201cOh my god! Qinghuan! How could you become so fucking slim?\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe knew he was slim now. But where did the \u2018fucking slim\u2019 come from?Zhao Qingyuan\u2018s face was very conspicuous, plus his iconic loud voice. Now the whole crew knew he came to visit Qinghuan. Everyone looked super excited. Some even tried to get close to him. Yu Qinghuan could only bring the two of them back to his little shack.Since Huo Qu was here, he didn\u2019t say a word. Yu Qinghuan noticed he was a little abnormal. So he walked before him and asked, \u201cHuo Qu, are you ok? Not in the mood?\u201dHuo Qu pursed his lips, and looked at Yu Qinghuan who was so slim that only a gust of wind would blow him down. He said, \u201cQinghuan.\u201d He carefully touched Yu Qinghuan\u2019s fingers and asked, \u201cAre you sick? How come you are so slim?\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t listen to Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s nonsense.\u201d Yu Qinghuan was afraid he might not understand if he explained too much, so he made an excuse, \u201cThis is the special effect of makeups. I\u2019m neither slim nor sick.\u201d\u201cNo, you become thinner.\u201d Huo Qu shook his head, stressed while staring at Yu Qinghuan, \u201cmuch thinner.\u201dThis person became harder and harder to fool, Yu Qinghuan sighed in his heart. But still he stayed calm and collected, \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2026\u201dBefore he finished his words, Huo Qu suddenly bent over.When Yu Qinghuan was wondering what he was doing, the next second Huo Qu directly gave him a Princess hug.\u201cYou are thinner, a lot thinner than last time.\u201d Huo Qu said affirmatively after weighing him with his hands.He then lowered his head, staring at Yu Qinghuan, \u201cQinghuan, you are lying to me.\u201dYu Qinghuan felt a little guilty under the staring of his pair of bright and innocent eyes.\u201cPut me down!\u201d He moved his body and acted tough to order him.\u201cNo!\u201d Huo Qu turned him down blandly, \u201cUnless you tell me the truth.\u201dBut\u2026Yu Qinghuan touched his forehead.

He lowered his head and dared not look at Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes, explaining vaguely.\u201cLast time? Why didn\u2019t I know?\u201d Yu Qinghuan suddenly had some kind of strange feeling. He even forgot that he was still in Huo Qu\u2019s arms. He then pressed him with his eyes narrowed, \u201cYou owe me an explanation.\u201dHuo Qu was afraid he might be mad at him, so he could only tell the truth obediently, \u201cLast time when you were sick\u2026\u201dThat day Qinghuan looked very sad. He even talked in his sleep, maybe because he had some bad dreams.Seeing Yu Qinghuan like that, Huo Qu also felt very awful.He didn\u2019t know what to do. In a moment of desperation, he could only jump onto the bed and held Yu Qinghuan in his arms, hoping that he could comfort him this way.It was really metaphysical. After being held up by Huo Qu, Yu Qinghuan, who felt very sick, gradually quieted down and then fell fast asleep.To Huo Qu, this little tiny thing was like a sweet sweet candy. After obtaining such a precious treasure, he carefully put it away, and took it out sometimes to smell or sniff secretly. He wouldn\u2019t even want anyone else to look at it.Absolutely, Yu Qinghuan is no outsider. But\u2026Huo Qu\u2019s institution told him he better hide it from him.After making it clear, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s strange feeling was almost gone. He then elbowed Huo Qu\u2019s chest, signaling Huo Qu to put him down, and then said awkwardly, \u201cAll right. I am not sick at all. I lose some weight only for the movie. So don\u2019t worry. I will grow fat again after this.\u201dAs Yu Qinghuan expected, Huo Qu quite possibly didn\u2019t get what he was trying to express.Seeing Yu Qinghuan\u2019s relaxing expression, Huo Qu could only pull a corner of his clothes and begged him, \u201cQinghuan, you can\u2019t fall sick again. You have to take care of yourself.\u201dYu Qinghuan smiled, \u201cI know. I know. Stop nagging me.\u201dHuo Qu then said with a serious tone, \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m worried about you.\u201dZhao Qinghuan beside who was totally ignored, \u201c\u2026\u201dWait! Why does he feeling something ain\u2019t no right? Where does this dog food come from? Has he been out of his mind after shooting too many movies?\u201cQinghuan!\u201d To stress his presence and also break the weird atmosphere in the room, Zhao Qingyuan moved forward and stood between the two of them, and then tried to pull Yu Qinghuan out, \u201cCome here. Come here. I got something to tell you.\u201dYu Qinghuan was confused, \u201cWhat is it? Can\u2019t you say it here?\u201dZhao Qingyuan stared at him resentfully, \u201cI am all for your own good!\u201dNow Yu Qinghuan got more confused. He could only go out with him and didn\u2019t stop until they walked to very remote corner. Then he asked, \u201cSo what is it?\u201d\u201cHere.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan took out a few pretty hairbands out of the pocket of his coat like a thief and slipped them into Yu Qinghuan\u2019s hand, \u201cI specially picked those for you. Do you like them?\u201dYu Qinghuan thought girl\u2019s stuff was almost the same. So he just said, \u201cYeah, they are pretty.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201d Zhao Qingyuan snickered and then hit Yu Qinghuan with his shoulder, \u201cAs long as you like them.\u201dYu Qinghuan thought Zhao Qingyuan was a little weird today. But he always performed like that. So Yu Qinghuan also couldn\u2019t tell where he was weird, until\u2026\u201cQinghuan~\u201d Zhao Qingyuan winked at him and whispered, \u201cLet me tell you. My sister is a designer.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c???\u201dWhat is he trying to say? Why would he mention his sister to him baselessly?Zhao Qingyuan, \u201cThe costumes she designs are very popular among young girls. She was famous in the circle! After I go back, I will ask her to design a dress for you.\u201dAfter saying that, he gave Yu Qinghuan an I\u2019m-worthy-to-be-your-best-friend look.Yu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a long time silence, he looked at Zhao Qinghuan blandly, \u201cQingyuan, seriously. Go buy some walnuts.\u201dThis time Zhao Qinghuan became the one getting totally confused, \u201cAh? Walnuts? You want to eat? I can bring you some next time I come.\u201d After a pause, he started a conversation 1,000 miles away from the topic, \u201cYou see, this place is really off the map, like living in deep mountains.\u201dYu Qinghuan was disinclined to explain it to him. When Zhao Rui sent someone to ask him back to shoot, he gave the headbands to Wang Ruirui in Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s face.Zhao Qingyuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dUnder the strong comparison of the little girl\u2019s overjoyed expression, Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s thunder-struck face was extra arresting.Yu Qinghuan heaved a sigh and stretched a hand to pat his shoulder with sympathy, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to buy walnuts for yourself.\u201dZhao Qingyuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had no face to stay, so he dragged Huo Qu to leave no matter what.Unfortunately Huo Qu finally got a chance to see Yu Qinghuan. How would he leave like this? No matter what Zhao Qingyuan said, he just wouldn\u2019t leave. Finally Zhao Qingyuan had no choice but to leave in dismay.Once he left, Huo Qu immediately turned to Yu Qinghuan, \u201cQinghuan, what did you talk just now?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d After recalling about that thing, Yu Qinghuan felt painful in his forehead, \u201cJust some trifle thing.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d asked Huo Qu while staring at Yu Qinghuan with all question marks on his face.Now he only looked at Yu Qinghuan expressionlessly, which gave Yu Qinghuan a lot of pressure. Now he was only afraid that Huo Qu might do some \u2018appalling\u2019 things at the filming site. So he could only try to explain it to Huo Qu, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious, I promise. There\u2019s a mistake between us. Now we talk it through and problem solved.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Huo Qu nodded but still didn\u2019t move his eyes away.Yu Qinghuan thought he was not satisfied with the reason he provided. When he was about say something more detailed, Huo Qu said by his ear\u2026Huo Qu, \u201cI\u2019ve never taken you by mistake.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201cHm?\u201dHuo Qu, \u201cSo, Qinghuan, I\u2019m better to you than him.\u201dYu Qinghuan was caught dumbfounded and then realized what was happening. So this guy thought he and Zhao Qingyuan were having some private talk, so he was jealous?\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cYu Qinghuan, hurry up!\u201d When Yu Qinghuan was about to say something, Zhao Rui not far away urged him impatiently, \u201cEveryone is waiting for you!\u201d\u201cComing!\u201d Yu Qinghuan responded with a high pitch. But glancing at Huo Qu beside who was still waiting for his answer, he could only say vaguely, \u201cI know.\u201d And then he scurried to the shooting site.While Yu Qinghuan was shooting, Huo Qu just waited by side. So many people here, but his eyes were only moving with Yu Qinghuan.Seeing the character Yu Qinghuan played cry or feel upset, although he knew it was all fake, Huo Qu still had the urge to rush out and held him in his arms and make him smile, no other bad feelings anymore.\u201cYou also like brother Qinghuan?\u201d a little girl\u2019s soft voice sounded by his ears, then Huo Qu turned around and saw a sweet and cute little girl was sitting by his side who was looking up to him.Huo Qu was a little confused, \u201cLike him?\u201dThe little girl ignored his question and continued, \u201cI like brother Qinghuan very much. How I wish Qinghuan is my real brother!\u201dThen she kept saying this and that, but Huo Qu already couldn\u2019t block them out of his head, with only the word \u201clike\u201d repeating in his head, like being possessed.He felt like he got something, but couldn\u2019t think it through.He knew that his like for Yu Qinghuan was much more than anyone else\u2019s like for him. But what kind of like was that! He himself also didn\u2019t understand now.The only thing he was certain was that he should be good to Qinghuan, better than anyone else, then Qinghuan wouldn\u2019t be stolen away.Huo Qu had his mind wandering the whole afternoon. It was not until Yu Qinghuan came to him after the shooting did he came to his sense.\u201cSo you just sat here the whole afternoon? Aren\u2019t you cold?\u201d Yu Qinghuan held a few boxes of takeaway food with one hand and spared the other to pull Huo Qu, \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go back and eat some food.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d Huo Qu nodded. When he was about to lift his foot, he glanced at a corner somewhere and suddenly stopped.In there, Zhao Rui bent over and said to Wang Ruirui extremely gently, \u201cDo you feel cold? Come here. Let me take you back to the hotel. You\u2019ll feel warm there.\u201dHuo Qu lowered his eyes, with something shining flashing by.After they got back to Yu Qinghuan\u2019s shack, the two of them dug the supper in a hurry. Now the water in the heater was boiled. Yu Qinghuan asked Huo Qu to take a bath first, and him second.When he got out of the bathroom, he saw that Huo Qu was curling in bed, like he was freezing cold.Yu Qinghuan felt a little odd. He remembered that he turned on the electric blanket before they took the bath. Is it because the electric blanket bad quality? Or broken?He then moved forward and felt the blanket! No! It is warm enough. But why Huo Qu would feel so cold?\u201cIs it so cold?\u201d Yu Qinghuan asked while drying his hair.Huo Qu nodded and answered him vaguely, \u201cKind of.\u201d\u201cWhat about I send you home?\u201d Yu Qinghuan was a little worried. Judging from Huo Qu\u2019s reaction, he shouldn\u2019t belong to cold-resistant constitution. It\u2019d bad if he catches a cold.On hearing him, Huo Qu immediately shook his head hard, \u201cI won\u2019t go back.\u201d Like he could even face death unflinchingly.Yu Qinghuan could only take another quilt to cover on him. After a while, he asked again, \u201cAre you still feeling cold?\u201dHuo Qu, \u201cHm.\u201dThis is super odd!Yu Qinghuan cursed in his heart and then hung the wet towel on the chair, took off his shoes and slipped into bed.He switched the electric blanket to the top. The mattress\u2019 temperature was nearly hot. The moment Yu Qinghuan pulled open the quilt, a blast of warmth directly dashed in his face.He calls this cold?He doubtfully reached out for Huo Qu\u2019s forehead, temperature normal, unlike he had a fever. So what is going on with him?Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t notice that the moment he climbed onto the bed, like a little hamster, Huo Qu was moving to his side little by little quite slowly. When he realized it, they were already sticking together.\u201cIs it really so cold?\u201d asked Yu Qinghuan while pulling the quilt up for him.Huo Qu responded with a \u201chm\u201d, then looked up to peep at Yu Qinghuan. After a few seconds, he muttered with his long and thick eyelashes quivering, \u201cI heard\u2026it\u2019d be warm if two hold each other in arms.\u201dAfter a pause, he looked at Yu Qinghuan, asking, \u201cQinghuan, is that true?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)Translator: Guy Gone BadSo, all the foreshadowing is only for this last appealing?Yu Qinghuan squinted at Huo Qu, thinking, \u201cSince when this person has learnt to be so cunning?\u201dHe hummed and then flipped slightly on Huo Qu\u2019s forehead and said, \u201cNo.\u201dHuo Qu never expected Yu Qinghuan would deny it. For a moment he got dumbfounded and completely had no idea what to do next.His eyes wide open, filled with shocking and unbelieving in the black pupils, making him both silly and adorable.Yu Qinghuan couldn\u2019t help but tease him a bit. So he kicked him under the quilt, and said lazily, \u201cWhat? Is there any problem?\u201dHuo Qu\u2019s face reddened all over. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but didn\u2019t know where to start.\u201cIt serves you right.\u201d Yu Qinghuan snickered, \u201cWill you tell a lie again? Let me tell you\u2026\u201dBefore he finished his words, a 37\u00b0 warm body pounced at him, rudely swamping down on him.\u201cHuo Qu, what are you doing?\u201d Yu Qinghuan could barely breathe, so he tried to push him away.But the harder he struggled, the tighter Huo Qu held him.Yu Qinghuan just had a bath, only wearing a thin shirt. The warmth of Huo Qu\u2019s body was transmitted onto his through that thin layer of cloth, like a tiny kindling instantly igniting a big fire inside his body, crackling, nearly having burnt his sense away.Yu Qinghuan was into men, and Huo Qu absolutely met all his aesthetical standard, plus he was only in his twenties\u2026His breaths immediately became quite heavy\u2026\u201cHuo Qu, get up.\u201d Yu Qinghuan tilted his head slightly and said to him, panting, \u201cBe good.\u201dHuo Qu didn\u2019t respond like he didn\u2019t hear him at all, still burying his head in Yu Qinghuan\u2019s neck, rubbing like a cat.When Huo Qu\u2019s soft hair gently swept his sensitive skin, Yu Qinghuan felt numb in the scalp and nearly couldn\u2019t control himself and do some nasty thing. Having no choice, he could only use outflanking tactics, \u201cThis is not the right way to hug. Get off me. I will teach you.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d said Huo Qu sullenly, but also firmly to express his determination.Yu Qinghuan, \u201cHuo Qu, are you trying to piss me off?\u201dHuo Qu shook his head, saying nothing.It really have Yu Qinghuan a big headache! What is wrong with Huo Qu today? If he had known he would be like this, Yu Qinghuan would never tease me. Anyway he wouldn\u2019t lose a pound of flesh giving him a hug!He sighed and stretched out his hand to stroke Huo Qu\u2019s hair.. Huo Qu thought he still wanted to push him away, so he directly held his hand in the air and pressed his hand on the bed, ten fingers clasped.Yu Qinghuan pretended to be angry, \u201cAre you trying to suffocate me?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d retorted Huo Qu, aggrieved.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you get off me?\u201d\u201cI just\u2026I just want to hug you.\u201dAfter a pause, Yu Qinghuan laughed in spite of himself, \u201cHow can you hug me like this? Be good. Get off me first.\u201dHuo Qu still shook his head. While he was speaking, Huo Qu\u2019s wet lips skimmed over Yu Qinghuan\u2019s skin gently, giving him a wave of shudder. Yu Qinghuan\u2019s corner of his eyes slightly reddened. When he raised his chin and meant to say something, Huo Qu\u2019s pitiable voice sounded, \u201cQinghuan, don\u2019t you want me to hug you?\u201dYu Qinghuan pretended to be angry and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201dHe thought he could \u2018bully\u2019 Huo Qu this time, but on the contrary, Huo Qu\u2019s voice became astoundingly joyful, \u201cI know! No is yes, right? Qinghuan, I knew it!\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dSuddenly he felt that he had dug a pit for himself, and then buried himself in, and finally stepped on to consolidate it.Having stayed with Yu Qinghuan for a few days, Huo Qu had to go back to work since the holiday ended. Finally he got picked up by Huo Zheng.After informing Zhao Rui, Yu Qinghuan went out to see them off.\u201cCome to our place this Spring Festival.\u201d Huo Zheng suddenly invited him, \u201cMy parents both appreciate your favor and want to see you.\u201dYu Qinghuan was a little surprised and then shook his head, saying, \u201cPlease tell uncle and auntie, thank you for inviting me.\u201d He then pointed at Zhao Rui wearing a long face not far away, and said smilingly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m gonna spend my Spring Festival here in the crew, otherwise Director Zhao will flip out.\u201dSpring Festival is a big occasion. However harsh Zhao Rui is, he couldn\u2019t forbid the actors having a family reunion dinner. As smart as Huo Zheng was, he immediately understood Yu Qinghuan was excusing himself from their invitation.He couldn\u2019t expose him, so he just gave Yu Qinghuan a meaningful look and said, \u201cAll right then. Come visit us when you have time. Our gate is always open for you.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Yu Qinghuan nodded. After Huo Zheng got into the car, he then waved his hand at Huo Qu who was staring at him through the window and went back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2)Translator: Guy Gone Bad\u201cYour little kid has gone?\u201d Seeing him come back, Zhao Rui snorted, with a cigar in his mouth.He had a severe craving for cigarettes. The cigars were almost never off his fingers, unless Wang Ruirui was around.Yu Qinghuan couldn\u2019t help but persuade him, \u201cSmoke less.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Everybody dies.\u201d Zhao Rui then threw the butt into the trash can unconcernedly, still looking gloomy, \u201cHurry up! We are too slow these days.\u201dYu Qinghuan sighed and then followed him to work.Last time when Zhao Rui was digging his wallet, he dropped a picture out of it. Yu Qinghuan picked it up for him and saw a little girl in it.About 7 or 8 years old, round face, round eyes, smiling like a little sun, very cute. He immediately guessed it should be Zhao Rui\u2019s late little sister.The little girl looked somewhat like Wang Ruirui, which was why Zhao Ruirui treated Wang Ruirui specially.He saw that Zhao Rui wore a rather stiff smile at Wang Ruirui and felt sore in his heart.In the next few days, Zhao Rui felt like he was possessed by Zhou Bapi (a landlord in Chinese fable who tries to drain his laborers. In ancient China, when the cock crows, it means it\u2019s dawn, so the laborers have to get up to work. So Zhou Bapi would pretend to crow like a cock even earlier than the cock, so his laborers have to wake up to work ever earlier.) He wished that he could shoot 24/7. As young and energetic as Yu Qinghuan, he nearly couldn\u2019t hold it.In the film crew, everyone had got dark circles under their eyes caused by lack of sleep and complained a lot. However, this kind of complaint reached to its peak when hearing the sound of firecrackers set off by the villagers nearby.They were on the outskirts of the city, next to a small village.In villages there was no firecracker control. Only after 23th of the twelfth lunar month, be it adults or kids, people all began to set off fireworks to celebrate.The deafening sound of firecrackers brought a strong atmosphere of the Spring Festival and the whole crew already had no heart to work. But after some people who tried to ask for a leave got told off by Zhao Rui, no one dare ask a leave then.In the morning on lunar December 30th, they shot a scene taking advantage of the morning sun. When everyone cleared up the props and was preparing for the next scene, ZhaoRui suddenly said, \u201cToday and tomorrow, two days off. You can go.\u201dSome froze there, jaws dropped, some dropped the props accidentally, and some even thought they got phonism.On seeing that, Zhao Rui snorted, \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t want to go home could stay and keep working.\u201dHardly had his voice faded away, all the crew fled helter-skelter, even fast than the rabbits, like the director would go back on his words the next second.Zhao Rui lowered his eyes, took out a cigarette, put it in his mouth, then picked up his phone and made a call, voice cold and rough, \u201cWe have two days off for the Spring Festival. When are you coming to pick Wang Ruirui home?\u201dNo one knew what the person on the other side of the phone said, Zhao Rui\u2019s face suddenly grew livid. When he was about to say something more, the other side already hung up.He took a deep breath and dialed another number, but only got busy tone.\u201cFuck! Son of a bitch!\u201d Zhao Rui cursed, even his hands trembling. After quite a while, he lit the cigarette in his mouth.\u201cRuirui\u2019s parents won\u2019t come pick her home?\u201d Yu Qinghuan was standing beside. So he could tell what was happening through his performance.\u201cHm.\u201d Zhao Rui responded, and then said, \u201cThey asked Ruirui to stay in the crew. If everyone was gone, she got to stay with me!\u201d He then swore angrily, \u201cThese two assholes!\u201dThey just entrusted their daughter to a stranger they only met for once. They never considered whether this person had special hobbies, whether this person would abuse their daughter, whether this person would be good to their daughter. How could such irresponsible parents ever exist in this world?Otherwise his little sister wouldn\u2019t have died at such an early age!ZhaoRui held the phone tightly, eyes as\u201cBrother Qinghuan,\u201d Not far away, Wang Ruirui put down the book and called him with a very sweet voice, on her head was still wearing the headband he bought for her.Yu Qinghuan felt sour in his heart. He couldn\u2019t help but said to Zhao Rui, \u201cBrother Rui, if you got things to do, I can spend the festival with Ruirui.\u201dZhao Rui looked up at him, \u201cWon\u2019t you go home?\u201dYu Qinghuan said lightly, \u201cI am all alone. So it\u2019s all the same where to spend it.\u201dZhao Rui lowered his eyes and didn\u2019t say a word, so Yu Qinghuan had no idea whether he agreed or not.When it was noon, almost everyone was gone. Even the delivery man came to tell them no service on the Lunar New Year\u2019s Eve and Day. So now only the three of them were left.Wang Ruirui seemed to sense something. The little girl lowered her head, eyes reddened, afraid that she would be left alone. Instead of acting afraid of Zhao Rui as before, she followed him closely and even dare not make sound of her steps.It made Yu Qinghuan\u2019s heart ache. Ignoring whether Zhao Rui agreed or not, he held up the little girl and walked to his own shack, \u201cRuirui, let\u2019s spend the Spring Festival together, OK? I feel so lonely myself.\u201dThe little girl immediately widened her eyes, with tears in them, \u201cBrother Qinghuan, are you also alone?\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d Yu Qinghuan gently stroke her curling hair, \u201cSo I need your company. Will you agree?\u201d\u201cYes, yes, of course!\u201d The little girl nodded hard and then held Yu Qinghuan around his neck and turned tears into smiles.Yu Qinghuan went to the store in the village and bought some meat and vegetables, wanting to prepare a hearty New Year\u2019s Eve dinner for Wang Ruirui.There was no gas in his shack, but only an induction cooker which he could make do with.From afternoon till evening, Yu Qinghuan finally prepared eight delicate and tasteful dishes.\u201cBrother Qinghuan, you are awesome!\u201d looking at a full desk of dishes, Wang Ruirui\u2019s eyes were full of admiration.\u201cThis is your reward for accompanying me.\u201d Yu Qinghuan smiled, put the little girl on the stool beside the table, and handed her a pair of chopsticks, saying gently, \u201cHave a try. See if you like them.\u201d\u201cYou eat first, brother Qinghuan,\u201d Wang Ruirui shook her head, smiling shyly, and muttered, \u201cI like any dish you make.\u201dThe child is really too sensible, which nearly melted Yu Qinghuan\u2019s heart. He only thought that if he himself could have such a little daughter, he would pick up a star even at the cost of his life only if she wants it!When he sat beside Wang Ruirui and was about to eat, the door was pushed open, a chill mixed up with snowflakes poured in. Yu Qinghuan raised his head and saw it was Zhao Rui.He had two bottle of Red Star Erguotou (a brand of Chinese wine). He put them on the desk and sat on the opposite side of Yu Qinghuan.Of course Yu Qinghuan prepared his share when he cooked. So since he came, he didn\u2019t say a word, only passed him a pair of chopsticks.Zhao Rui opened his mouth, like he wanted to say thank you, but he felt like his throat got stuck and he couldn\u2019t make a sound. Finally, he just shut his mouth, wiped the cup he brought with him with his clothes and poured a cup of wine for Yu Qinghuan.On New Year's eve, three people crowded in small shack, circling around a short desk to have their reunion dinner. Under the warm yellow light, two tall men hunched down, picked dishes for the little girl now and then, receiving the little girl\u2019s sweet sweet smile as their bonus.No fancy restaurant, no exquisite dishes.But Yu Qinghuan thought this was the best Spring Festival he had spent in the past over ten years.Finally, he is not alone!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He only symbolically took a few sips with Zhao Rui and put down the cup.Zhao Rui didn\u2019t care either. He drank one cup after another silently.Yu Qinghuan originally wanted to persuade him not to drink too much but caught a glimpse of his low expression, he just swallowed what he wanted to say.Only once a year, let him have a good drink.Erguotou had a high degree. Even if Zhao Rui could drink like a fish, he would feel dizzy after drinking two bottles. Fortunately, he had good behavior after getting drunk and did not play the drunkard. He only took out the picture in his wallet and looked at it silently.\u201cWhat happened to Uncle Rui?\u201d Wang Ruirui blinked and her immature face was full of concern.Probably because of her living environment since childhood, the little girl was extremely sensitive and instantly realized that Zhao Rui was in a bad mood.\u201cNothing,\u201d said Yu Qinghuan in a gentle voice, he picked up a shrimp for then, \u201cUncle Rui is just drunk, Rui Rui. Don\u2019t you worry.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Wang Rui Rui believed what he said and nodded, and her voice was crisp and tender. \u201cMy dad is often drunk, and he hits people when he is drunk.\u201dYu Qinghuan felt distressed. Children didn\u2019t know how to lie, and what they say in childish words was often the truth. Her deep impression of her dad\u2019s drunk status showed how suffering Wang Rui Rui was at home.He sighed and was trying to pick up some food for the girl as a consolation only to find out that her second bowl of rice was already empty. Yu Qinghuan immediately got a fright and quickly put down his chopsticks and asked, \u201cRuirui, are you stuffed?\u201dHe blamed himself in his heart. Why didn\u2019t he take care of her a little more? What should he do if she got sick from eating too much? It would be hard to see a doctor on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201cYes, a little.\u201d Wang Ruirui put down her chopsticks with a red face.The little girl was short of love at an early age. Zhao Rui and Yu Qinghuan were the only two who cared for her. She was so happy that she was afraid of what she did to make the two unhappy. Thus, she didn\u2019t refuse to accept the dishes they had brought and eaten them all.Clearly, she was less than eight years old, but she experienced what she should not have endured at her age.Yu Qinghuan was distressed and worried, and had no appetite to eat now. He hurriedly led her out to help with the digestion.Fortunately, children digested well and after only 20 minutes of walking, Wang Ruirui said she felt much better.Yu Qinghuan immediately breathed a sigh of relief, and then rubbed her little head, \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dWhen they went out, Yu Qinghuan was afraid that the girl would get cold, so he specially prepared a thick coat to wrap the little girl like a panda.At this time, she was walking in the snow with small steps. Her clothes were furry, making her look like a little penguin toddling to walk.Yu Qinghuan felt itchy in his heart. He couldn\u2019t help bending down and, in Wang Ruirui\u2019s screaming, lifted her up and put her on his shoulder. \u201cCome on, ride the horse.\u201dThis was the first time in Wang Ruirui\u2019s life that she had such a novel experience.Soon, fear turned into excitement.On a snowy winter night, the little girl\u2019s crisp and tenellous laughter spread far away.Perhaps tired from walking, Wang Ruirui\u2019s eyelids began to fight as soon as she returned to the small shack. Yu Qinghuan plugged in the electric blanket and let her sleep in his bed.The girl had a life assistant, but because of the New Year\u2019s Eve, her assistant went back to celebrate the New Year.Yu Qinghuan could not send her back to the hotel since she would be alone. Zhao Rui was drunk and unconscious who couldn\u2019t even tell where south was, let alone taking care of the child. He could only let Wang Ruirui sleep in his room.The little girl started to dream very fast. The firecrackers outside had no effect on her at all. Yu Qinghuan touched her little red face. When he wanted to tidy up the table, he heard heavy sound of footsteps mixed with an anxious male voice outside the shack. \u201cSlow down, San\u2019er! What are you running for? Ah!\u201dYu Qinghuan was excited and ran to open the door before he put down the bowl.\u201cQinghuan!\u201d The tip of Huo Qu\u2019s nose was slightly red, a snowflake hung on his eyelashes, but his eyes were sparkling. \u201cHere I am!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave him to you.\u201d Huo Rong came up with a face of helplessness and said to Yu Qinghuan, \u201cWhen he heard that you\u2019re going to have a family reunion dinner tonight, he insisted on not staying at home anyway but coming to accompany you.\u201dHuo Rong paused and patted Yu Qinghuan on the shoulder, \u201cI wish you a happy New Year in advance.\u201d\u201cHappy New Year,\u201d Yu Qinghuan replied after a while. It was not until Huo Rong waved his hand and walked away that he came to himself. Looking at Huo Qu, he frowned and scolded, \u201cWhat are you doing here? It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve!\u201d\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Huo Qu tried to hold Yu Qinghuan\u2019s wrist with a smile on his face, \u201cI\u2019m with you.\u201dYu Qinghuan sighed, pulled him into the room and closed the door. \u201cHuo Qu, you may not understand that Spring Festival is the most important festival of the year, so on this day, we all have to spend time with our most important people. Don\u2019t be capricious, okay?\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Huo Qu said earnestly, looking into Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes, \u201cI want to be with you.\u201dYu Qinghuan felt his heart skipped a beat and could not speak for a long time.His heart was firmly occupied by warmth, and the original loneliness was totally swept away. Obviously, the words were simple but with incomparable magic, it almost made him red in the eyes.Yu Qinghuan\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved a little bit. He was about to say something when he saw Huo Qu suddenly stare his big eyes as if he couldn\u2019t believe what he saw. He looked at Wang Ruirui and Zhao Rui in the room. That expression was like catching his husband having an affair with someone else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So he immediately tried to change the subject. The next second, he saw Huo Qu sip his lips and say with grievance, \u201cQinghuan, you don\u2019t want me to come to you, do you?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Yu Qinghuan replied without thinking.\u201cBut why are there others in your room? Are they your most important people? Do you want to spend the Spring Festival with them the most?\u201dYu Qinghuan immediately had a headache and wished the time would go back to a few minutes ago and swallow his words back.Facing Huo Qu\u2019s accusing eyes, he explained under great pressure, \u201cSometimes\u2026 um\u2026 Spring Festival also needs to be spent with friends.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you want to spend the festival with me? Am I not your friend?\u201dHuo Qu questioned, and his eyes were red.He didn\u2019t want to be like this either, but he just couldn\u2019t control himself. Qinghuan was surrounded by more and more people. He was so scared that even if he tried his best to be nice to Qinghuan, he would eventually become farther away from him.Huo Qu felt a tightness in his chest, intensely staring at Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes as if he want a satisfactory answer.\u201cBaby,\u201d Yu Qinghuan took him by the shoulder, sighed, and smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t be like this. Spring Festival is a reunion day. Brother Rui, Ruirui and I, we all have no family and can only make do with each other.\u201d\u201cHow about with me for next Spring Festivals?\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d\u201cThen... then shall I be the most important one to you?\u201dYu Qinghuan didn\u2019t answer, Huo Qu was so nervous that he held his breath. When his heart almost jumped out, Yu Qinghuan finally spoke.He said, \u201cYou already are.\u201dHuo Qu came as soon as he heard that Qinghuan was going to have a family reunion dinner tonight so he didn\u2019t have supper. Yu Qinghuan had to heat up the leftovers on the table and brought them up to him.Huo Qu still did not know how to use chopsticks and ate slowly. When he finally had enough, it was almost midnight in the morning.Yu Qinghuan had just drunk a little wine, and now his head was so excited that he took Huo Qu to sit at the door and watched the fireworks together.Although the fireworks in the sky were not as beautiful and dense as those in large squares, they reflected the starlight all over the sky, which was quite special.Yu Qinghuan lifted up his head and had a strong feeling of the New Year. He said to Huo Qu, \u201cMake a wish. I heard that the wishes made under the fireworks will come true.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Huo Qu asked pleasantly.\u201cYeah,\u201d Yu Qinghuan replied gently, quipping, \u201cWhat? Don\u2019t tell me you wish is to win the Nobel Prize!\u201dJust as the words fell, Huo Qu\u2019s devout voice was ringing by Yu Qinghuan\u2019s ears.\u201cI want to spend every New Year with Qinghuan,\u201d he said.Yu Qinghuan held his breath and his heartbeat was out of balance. After quite a while, he lowered his eyes and whispered, \u201cYou little fool.\u201d\u201cQinghuan,\u201d just when he was in a blank, Huo Qu suddenly took his hand and shyly put something a little cool into his hand, \u201cThis is my New Year gift to you.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Yu Qinghuan lowered his head and looked into his palm.In his palm lay a round crystal pendant, glittering and translucent, shining under the bright fireworks, as if a fallen star and was extremely beautiful. The only fly in the ointment was that the inside of the pendant was empty and there was nothing in it.He felt a little funny, was Huo Qu take him as a little girl to send such a cute thing to him?He was just about to ask if Huo Qu really bought the necklace for him when he heard the other party\u2019s proud but a little shy voice, \u201cQinghuan, I have frozen our DNA here with liquid ethane according to the principle of frozen electron microscope, and we can see it with electron microscope.\u201dHuo Qu paused and carefully touched the crystal pendant with a small voice, \u201cQinghuan, your DNA structure is the most beautiful one I have ever seen.\u201dYu Qinghuan\u2019s fingers trembled slightly, \u201cHow did you get my DNA?\u201dHuo Qu took a quick glance at Yu Qinghuan, his eyelashes quivered and he said with little confidence, \u201cI, I secretly picked up your hair.\u201dYu Qinghuan tried his best to restrain his upturned lip and continued to ask, \u201cWhy do you want to do this?\u201dHuo Qu sipped his lip, revealing a round dimple on his left face. \u201cSorry, Qinghuan, sometimes I can\u2019t stay by your side. But with this, I can be with you all the time.\u201dYu Qinghuan was silent for a long time, but he managed to suppress his heart throb and said with difficulty, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t prepare a present...\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Huo Qu leaned toward him, \u201cWith you by my side, I am happier than receiving any present.\u201dYu Qinghuan thought, it was must because the moonlight tonight was too beautiful, he actually had an impulse to kiss Huo Qu.No, absolutely not! Huo Qu was the loveliest person in the world, and he could not tempt him onto this road.However, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s heart was turbulent and surging. He could not help but feel sour in his nose. He finally did not resist it and leaned against Huo Qu\u2019s shoulder.Just once, he gently closed his eyes. He indulged himself only for this once. After tomorrow, what happened today would be hidden forever in memory and never be mentioned again.Huo Qu\u2019s body was very warm. Even though they were separated by thick coats, Yu Qinghuan could still feel his warmth. The stamina of alcohol in Yu Qinghuan\u2019s body reached its peak at this moment, and he fell asleep against Huo Qu\u2019s shoulder.\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Huo Qu called him and he answered after quite some time.Huo Qu lowered his head. From his perspective, he could see Yu Qinghuan\u2019s soft hair, long thick eyelashes, and his high and delicate nose bridge.This man was so beautiful almost every part of his body that he attracted Huo Qu\u2019s sight every minute and every second. Huo Qu\u2019s heart was beating fast and an inexplicable impulse ran around his body. He didn\u2019t know what to do to ease this feeling.He instinctively hugged Yu Qinghuan and rubbed his head gently with his own head, there was an extreme desire in his voice, \u201cQinghuan, I like you so, so much.\u201dOn his shoulder, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s lips slightly curled and he was sleeping soundly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He not only rearranged the schedule, but also hired a few more staffs, which was epoch-making for him.\u201cBrother Rui, I\u2019d like to ask for a leave tomorrow.\u201d On the evening of the 14th of the first lunar month, after filming the last scene, Yu Qinghuan walked up to Zhao Rui and wiped the mud on his face while saying, \u201cOne of my previous endorsed products needs me to retake the pictures.\u201dYu Qinghuan received a call from Ada today and it was said that the product had found another spokesperson for their exquisite watches and asked Yu Qinghuan to take some group photos with him.Although it was just some group photos, it would still take a lot time for two who did not know each other to have a perfect cooperation and produce photos of high quality. Thus, this process may take longer than one day.Hearing this, Zhao Rui suddenly frowned. One day delay meant more money would be spent. He had to save money to publicize the movie. To be fair, no director would like this.Just as he was about to ask if Yu Qinghuan\u2019s arrangement could be rescheduled, Yu Qinghuan continued, \u201cBrother Rui, tomorrow is the 15th day of the first lunar month. Everyone wants to go home for family reunion. You might as well give everyone a day off.\u201dEver since the New Year\u2019s Eve meal, Yu Qinghuan and Zhao Rui had become much more familiar and they could even play jokes on each other.He found out Zhao Rui was actually a man with a sharp tongue but a soft heart. The reason why he squeezed the time of the cast was to give everyone two days off during the Spring Festival.However, his harsh words would only offend people. Who would care about his real intention?Yu Qinghuan gave him a gentle pat on the shoulder and said, \u201cBrother Rui, Ada\u2019s schedule cannot be changed. Please be kind to give me a day off and let everyone rest for a day.\u201dThe filming was already approaching the ending. It was estimated that it would be finished in less than a week. In this case, to let everyone go back on the Lantern Festival for a day\u2019s off was not a big deal.Zhao Rui was silent for a moment, then gave him a gloomy look, \u201cDo I have other choices?\u201dYu Qinghuan was the absolute leading role in this play. If he was absent, the movie had no need to be filmed. Since he wanted a break, it was meaningless for the film crew to stay. Zhao Rui had little space for negotiation.\u201cThank you, Brother Rui,\u201d Yu Qinghuan smilingly thanked him and put on the down jacket Yu Xin handed over to him.\u201cBrother Qinghuan, I\u2026can I go with you?\u201d While Yu Qinghuan was talking to Zhao Rui, Wang Rui Rui kept her ears on one side.The girl\u2019s deepest fear was the word \u201cvacation\u201d, which meant that she may have to stay alone in the hotel again, or be put somewhere else. She glanced at Yu Qinghuan\u2019s face carefully and finally could not help asking.To tell the truth, Yu Qinghuan was somewhat embarrassed. Ada\u2019s shooting scene was full of people, and he had a tight schedule tomorrow. Once he started to work,, there would be no time for him to take care of her. It was really inconvenient for him to take her over there.But when he bowed his head to look at the girl\u2019s big expectant eyes, his refusing words immediately turned into \u201cokay\u201d.After getting along with her for more than a month, this was the first time that Wang Ruirui had made a request. If he really refused her, she would be even more afraid to express her thoughts to the outside world.Yu Qinghuan sighed and thought, \u201cForget it, let Yu Xin take care of her tomorrow.\u201dThe whole film crew had been used to Zhao Rui\u2019s \u201cabuse\u201d. When they suddenly heard there would be a holiday tomorrow, they just thought it was false news. Some even took out their cell phones to see if April Fool\u2019s Day had come.When the news was confirmed not to be a lie, the cheerful howling immediately resounded through the entire filming site. Within an hour, the shooting scene had already been emptied.\u201cZhao Rui is really cruel to his staff,\u201d Yu Xin said. The leaving speed of these people was like fleeing from some plague. Then, he looked at the small face of his artist, thin and sunken, and agreed with his own words all the more.\u201cBrother Rui has no choice, either,\u201d Yu Qinghuan picked up the talk, and then took Yu Xin back to his little shack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their current location was at least one hour\u2019s journey from Ada. After hastily tidying up, the two men walked out of the door. Just as they were about to go to the hotel to pick up Wang Ruirui, they saw Zhao Rui leading the little girl toward them.Seeing Yu Xin\u2019s shocked eyes, Zhao Rui tried to explain, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Yu Qinghuan made a pause, and then immediately nodded. With Zhao Rui there, he would not be distracted when shooting. Although Zhao Rui looked rough, he was more careful than anyone in taking care of Wang Ruirui. One hundred of Yu Xin couldn\u2019t compare with one Zhao Rui.Now the film base was really empty.The three of them sat on Yu Xin\u2019s shabby second-hand Audi and they drove towards the city in a wobbly way. They did not know that shortly after they left, a large truck driven by a drunk driver overturned on the road outside the gate of the film base, directly pressing on the gas pipeline exposed to the outside because of long years out of repair, causing an explosion of the entire main gas pipeline.A big fire immediately burned up instantly and rushed into the film base in an unstoppable speed from all directions.The simple makeshift houses and various props temporarily set up for the shooting were swallowed up in the big and intense fire.By the time the firefighters arrived, the filming base had already turned into a sea of fire.The villagers nearby heard a loud explosion and came to see what was going on in twos and threes. When they saw the situation on the spot, they sighed as well as lamented.\u201cGod, how could this happen? The entire cast may not survive, I\u2019m afraid...\u201d\u201cYes. A really unexpected disaster! There was a young man in the cast who was really kind-hearted. He stuffed a handful of sugar into my daughter\u2019s hand last time. Alas...\u201dThe media came when they got the news. Hearing these comments, they immediately felt horror. A reporter chose a random villager and asked, \u201cIs the scene of the accident a film team? Was there anyone on the set when the explosion occurred?\u201d\u201cYes, I guess.\u201d The man sighed and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know how many people will survive. I heard that the movie will be finished soon. Never expected such a thing to happen...\u201dThe rest also echoed, \u201cYes, the film crew often ordered lunch boxes from us. The staff inside said that their team was pretty poor. But they never defaulted on our money.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s all because of lacking of money, so the director made full use of every minute to shoot and never let the actors out. Now I\u2019m afraid they are all over.\u201d\u201cMy daughter once acted as an extra in the movie, saying that their movie was called Orange. It was very touching. My daughter even cried when she knew what the movie said.\u201d\u201cWell, they ordered food from my sister\u2019s restaurant. My sister said that although their director was stingy, he was really nice. What a pity!\u201d\u2026Before the reporters arrived, although they had expected casualties, they did not expect that the entire film crew was in. How many people could there be? They felt numb just thinking about it.Just now they have learned the specific theme of the movie from the extras who once appeared in Orange.The theme was about a topic that had been heatedly discussed in recent years: Sexual abuse of children.There had been more news about the phenomena in recent years. When people first saw the news, they would be very indignant and some even wanted to chemically castrate these \u201cbeasts\u201d that raped children. However, nowadays, social media was stuffed with huge news, and people received more information every day. News came and was gradually being forgotten.At this time, there was an urgent need for a good movie that could uncover the seriousness of this topic and deeply imprint the crisis on every parent\u2019s mind.However, such a film was often not welcomed in the market. Under such circumstances, it could be seen that the director named Zhao Rui had his own belief and persistence in his heart.There was also a leading actor named Yu Qinghuan in the cast. Villagers familiar with the crew said that the crew was as poor as the church house and the actors even slept in the shacks on the construction site, so the leading actor definitely did not ask for a high salary.Young actors who were on the rise would seize every opportunity to shoot something that catered to the market. This one was different, there was even no news about his personal life, but he was working silently for the protection of children.Because of what the villagers said, the reporters all thought that the film crew of Orange were all in the scene of the accident. With the fire so fierce, the chances for the people inside to survive were extremely slim.Why couldn\u2019t nice guys get what they deserved? The reporters sighed and rushed to send the news to the Internet. This sad tragedy was the most eye-catching news and could win the sympathy of netizens.For a while, both the paper media and the network media were full of news about the big explosion, and they all mentioned the unlucky Orange film crew.Orange started its filming even without a start-up ceremony. Zhao Rui was worrying about the late publicity fee every day. Unexpectedly, the headlines of major social media triggered a huge wave of discussion on the Internet about the film crew and the movie.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019ll just say prayers ray for them.\u201d\u201cAh! Don\u2019t! I\u2019ve just fall in love with Qinghuan! Yesterday, I just complained that he always had no news, but such news is not what I\u2019ve expecting for. I\u2019m in a panic now. I hope he\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cI cried, really. I hope everyone is ok and I will go to the theatre to support the movie when it\u2019s released.\u201d\u201cThis kind of theme is rare in China. I can see that the director is a passionate filmmaker. I wish them all safe and sound.\u201d\u201cGood actor, good director. Anyway, I will definitely go to the cinema to support this movie. I hope everyone on this set will be safe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He replied to those who cared about him one by one. Then he put down the phone and said to Zhao Rui, \u201cBrother Rui, we must hurry back right now.\u201dAlthough none of their cast members were present on the site, the costumes and props they used for filming were still there, and they had to go back and make an inventory of what had been destroyed. Most importantly, they had to show up in front of the media and tell the public that they were all right.After Yu Qing Huan finished speaking, he phoned Evenson directly to explain the current situation, and he was very sorry to hope that the other party could postpone the shooting date. Although Evenson was somewhat embarrassed, he also knew that this was not a trivial matter, and he agreed after hesitating for a moment.On the way back, Zhao Rui kept silent. Yu Qinghuan thought he was panicking and wanted to comfort him, but he couldn\u2019t think of any appropriate words and could only give up.As soon as they arrived at the gate of the filming site, they were recognized by the reporters. They had been communicating with people all the year round, and their ability to remember faces was first class. Besides, they had just seen the photos of Yu Qinghuan and Zhao Rui.\u201cWere you, were you not at the filming site?\u201dThe reporters stared at them with disbelief on their faces. Even one reporter\u2019s microphone almost fell to the ground.\u201cThere was no one on the set.\u201d Zhao Rui\u2019s words settled down everyone\u2019s heart. \u201cThere were only the props we used for filming.\u201d\u201cNo one?\u201d Those reporters suddenly felt that their heads were a bit inadequate. Didn\u2019t they say that the film crew was desperately trying to speed up the process every day? How could there be no one on the set!?This doesn\u2019t make sense!Zhao Rui could only tell the whole story to them. The reporters were dumbfounded and looked at Yu Qinghuan as if they were looking at a human-shape koi.Was he ever kissed by God?!If it weren\u2019t for his day break and the application to Zhao Rui to give the whole cast a holiday, the entire film crew might have been engulfed by fire! One person saved the entire cast!Everyone thought it was a human tragedy, but it turned out to be a happy ending. This huge reverse was simply incredible!These reporters were silent for a few seconds, then rushed to post the follow-up on the Internet.In order to attract people\u2019s attention, extremely exaggerated headlines and words were specially used to describe this incident, which led all netizens to know Yu Qinghuan\u2019s good luck overnight.They all clamored to forward his microblog for good luck. Some were even more exaggerated, changing the name of their microblog name to \u201cYu Qinghuan\u2019s small scales\u201d and \u201cYu Qinghuan\u2019s koi beard\u201d.Outside the base, Zhao Rui looked at the darkened venue, then at his cell phone, and finally fixed his eyes on Yu Qinghuan.He looked fierce with a gloomy temperament. His staring at Yu Qinghuan was like he was planning to pick a fight!Just as Yu Xin couldn\u2019t help asking him what he was looking at, Zhao Rui suddenly opened his mouth, \u201cDo you have any photos? Send me one, I also want to forward a koi on Weibo.\u201dNot only did Yu Qinghuan save the lives of an entire film crew, he also made the major media promote the movie for free. It was truly a big profit with small capital!He was obviously not superstitious, but at this time he could not help but want to follow the crowd, thinking if he could be stained with some luck if he also forwarded a koi on Weibo.Before Yu Qinghuan could answer, Yu Xin\u2019s eyes brightened and he rushed over excitedly. He stood on his toes, put his arms around Zhao Rui\u2019s shoulder with great effort and said, \u201cYou also want to forward a koi? Emm, I do this every day and am especially experienced! You can see which of these photos is better, and I\u2019ll send you one!\u201dZhao Rui, with a serious face, stared at Yu Xin\u2019s cell phone for a full minute. Finally, he reached out his hand and pointed, \u201cThis one.\u201d\u201cOK, OK, OK. I will send it to you. Ah? What is your Weibo account? Let\u2019s follow each other. I\u2019ll @ you in the first place if I get new pictures.\u201d\u201cMovie Maker Zhao Rui.\u201d\u201cWell, I followed you!\u201d\u201cI followed you back.\u201dYu Qinghuan, who was left behind by the two, was totally speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was an absolute miracle.Before the results of the investigation came out, people\u2019s hearts were heavy and now they felt relieved. Even the paper media, which had always been holding a serious tone, couldn\u2019t help but joking with Yu Qinghuan\u2019s koi luck.Although the influence of the print media had gradually decreased in recent years, the retired ones at home were the loyal supporters of it.At the beginning, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s koi title was only circulated on the internet. After so much publicity in the paper media, even the old ladies dancing in the square now got acquaintance with him.\u201cAh? Yu Qinghuan? I know him! He is the little koi in Orange!\u201d\u201cYou think mom can\u2019t keep up with the times? You\u2019re despising your mom. I know Yu Qinghuan, the boy playing in Orange! The young man is really a koi!\u201d\u201cWow, Yu Qinghuan, the handsome and lucky boy. He could definitely prosper his family! I think this young man can be my son-in-law!\u201d\u2026For a time, Yu Qinghuan gained considerable fame and became the best son-in-law candidate in the hearts of these aunts.However, the story didn\u2019t end. Because of the big explosion, the film crew also became popular. Both the media and netizens were very concerned about the follow-up situation of them. Therefore, in recent days, there were often reporters wandering around the film set trying to find out some inside information.\u201cHi, I am a reporter from Phoenix Tree Media,\u201d a reporter grabbed a staff member of Orange crew and eagerly rushed up, \u201cCan I interview you?\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d the staff wiped the sweat from his head and nodded.Because their props and costumes were all burned down, Zhao Rui\u2019s temper had become even more violent these days and he assigned more tasks to his subordinates. As long as they could breathe for a while, let alone being interviewed, they would like to leave for everything even if go to the TV station!When the reporter heard this, his eyes suddenly brightened and he asked the already prepared questions, \u201cI heard that the fire destroyed everything on your set?\u201dThe staff nodded and sighed, \u201cYes, the shooting site is no longer available. We are now conducting a final count to see if there is anything else we can take away. We won\u2019t come here tomorrow.\u201dThe reporter sighed, \u201cAre you going to start from scratch?\u201dAlthough there were no casualties, it was said that the film crew was very poor and had a hard time finishing the movie. The film crew may never expect such a thing to happen. The fire even burnt the houses to ashes, not to mention those precious and fragile films.Well, one disaster after another. It might be difficult for the movie to be released, thought the reporter.\u201cAh?\u201d The staff was stunned. He didn\u2019t understand what the reporter said. Why did they have to do it again? Did the fire have anything to do with what they shot? The media practitioner was really strange...What the staff didn\u2019t know was the reporter was also scolding him in heart at this time. The film crew was poor, and its staff member also had a particularly long reflex arc. There was no film left, how could they make it without starting again? The reporter was afraid that the silly child hadn\u2019t figured it out yet.At the thought of this, the reporter gave the staff a pitying look and reminded him, \u201cYou have no film left, of course you have to shoot it again.\u201dThe staff gave him a puzzled look, \u201cWho said we have no film?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Now, the stunned one became the reporter.The staff scratched his head and blurted out without thinking, \u201cOur director is so stingy, how could he leave the films on the set!\u201dBut as soon as he finished speaking, he sensed that he shouldn\u2019t say such words. He looked around and didn\u2019t see the figure of Zhao Rui, so he breathed a sigh of relief and whispered to the reporter, \u201cExcuse me, can you pinch this off?\u201d\u201cAh, sure,\u201d the reporter replied casually and anxiously let him continue.\u201cWell,\u201d the staff reconsidered the wording and explained, \u201cYou know, our crew is poor and we can\u2019t even afford hotel rooms. Everyone, except the kid Wang Ruirui, including brother Yu, had to live in a shack. The shack could not be locked and was unsafe, and the director had no money to hire security guards. Every day we finished filming, we would move the machines, films and other valuables to Wang Rurui, a little girl\u2019s room and then took them to the set the next day.\u201dHe paused and smiled awkwardly, \u201cSo this fire only destroyed the props and costumes left on the set.\u201dThe reporter, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe public had been worried for so long since they thought the meaningful movie was going to run aground. But it turned out their worries were unnecessary!Stingy actually brought about extra bonus?The originally sharp-tongued reporter suddenly had a facial paralysis, not knowing what to say for the first time. He had to find another topic, \u201cOh, director Zhao is really prescient. I don\u2019t know if I can meet him today. I also want to interview him.\u201dHearing this, the staff immediately replied, \u201cAh? You looking for him? Director Zhao is not here today! Our venue will expire in a week, but it will not be available from today. He went to the person in charge to refund the money.\u201dThe reporter felt he was a mute at that time.The interview was quickly posted online, and the reporter deliberately kept the part where the staff said Zhao Rui was stingy. After watching it, the netizens almost turned over the sky with their laughter.[LOL, my God, I should feel sympathy for the film crew of Orange, but now I just want to laugh. What is wrong with me?][Hahaha, it\u2019s so funny. I feel like I am growing abdominal muscles because of too much laugh! What the hell? The director cam in person asking for a refund? The film crew is so funny from director to actors!][I suddenly feel that director Zhao\u2019s gloomy face is not so terrible. How could it be? Am I broken...][This film crew should be called as koi crew... Yes, I\u2019ll pay another visit to Yu Qinghuan\u2019s Weibo.][Whispering: The reporter didn\u2019t choke off that section. I observe a second of silence for the staff\u2019s tragic career\u2026 Hahaha!]\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was almost bored by Zhao Qingyuan these days and didn\u2019t even want to watch his cell phone.Zhao Qingyuan was never a person to stay idle. Knowing this had happened, he immediately used the excuse of visiting Yu Qinghuan to ask him out to play. How would Yu Qinghuan agree? Recently, the media had been keeping a close eye on him. If he and Zhao Qing yuan were photographed within the same frame again, no one knew what would happen.However, Zhao Qingyuan was really stubborn enough. The more he being rejected, the more persistence he would have.When Yu Qinghuan received the phone call, Zhao Qingyuan had left his agent and squatted downstairs of Yu Qinghuan\u2019s house.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me before you came?\u201d Yu Qinghuan rubbed his forehead with headache, \u201cI am still outside.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Zhao Qing yuan felt stupid, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d\u201cThe apartment manager has the key. I\u2019ll let him open the door for you. Please wait for me at home for a while.\u201d After a pause, he said anxiously, \u201cDon\u2019t run around.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan agreed sullenly, \u201cHurry up, I don\u2019t want to stay here by myself. It\u2019s borning.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dAt this time, Yu Qinghuan was packing for Wang Ruirui in the hotel. The filming was suspended and the staffs went home and awaited orders. But they could not leave Wang Ruirui alone in the hotel. Zhao Rui was busy with the remake of the movie and could not take care of her, but he didn\u2019t trust others on taking care of the little girl, so he entrusted this task to Yu Qinghuan.\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go and live in my place.\u201d Yu Qinghuan walked into the elevator with suitcase in one hand and Wang Ruirui in the other.\u201cOK!\u201d The little girl looked very happy. Her round little face was full of satisfaction, making Yu Qinghuan couldn\u2019t help rubbing her head.Yu Qinghuan\u2019s house and the film set were in the opposite direction, and it happened to be rush hour when they left. They took more than an hour to drive less than half distance.Fortunately, Yu Xin was careful enough and bought a big bag of food for Wang Ruirui as early as before driving. Otherwise, the little girl would be starving.\u201cWhen are we arriving at home with this snail speed?\u201d Yu Xin said gloomily as he looked at the long line of cars ahead. \u201cI\u2019m really sick of traffic jams.\u201d\u201cWait patiently, there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d Yu Qinghuan helped Wang Ruirui tear open the biscuit packaging, while saying so.Yu Xin then heaved another long sigh. Just as he was about to say something, the phone rang. At the moment, the traffic was stagnated. Yu Xin took out the phone and looked at it. He paused immediately and turned back to Yu Qinghuan. \u201cIt\u2019s Zhao Qingyuan.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Yu Qinghuan looked at his mobile phone and pressed it twice before it turned on. Only then did he find that the battery was almost dead. He looked up and said to Yu Xin, \u201cAnswer the phone call. He is waiting for me, you press hands-free.\u201dYu Xin answered the phone, \u201cHello, Mr. Zhao.\u201d\u201cIs Qinghuan with you?\u201d Zhao Qingyuan said anxiously.\u201cYes, just shoot. He is listening.\u201d\u201cQinghuan!\u201d Hearing this, Zhao Qingyuan suddenly increased his voice, \u201cWhen are you coming back? Can you come to pick me up? I am in Chongshang Wash.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid it will take another half hour,\u201d Yu Qinghuan estimated the speed and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Your car broken down?\u201d\u201cWell...urgh\u2026\u201d Zhao Qingyuan paused for a moment, but he still stammered out the matter, \u201cI, I went to wash the car, and then found out... I didn\u2019t drive actually.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c...\u201dHe seemed to feel Yu Qinghuan\u2019s silent contempt for him, so Zhao Qingyuan immediately self-pitied \u201cQinghuan, I walked against the cold wind for more than half an hour! I am frozen like a dead dog, ah, maybe I will even catch a cold!\u201dHe also did not know what he was thinking at the time. Maybe he followed the devil to the car dealership, even he himself felt a little strange.Yu Qinghuan, \u201cSince you can walk there by yourself, you can walk back.\u201dHearing this, Zhao Qingyuan became anxious, \u201cDon\u2019t, even if you kill me, I won\u2019t be able to walk back. Moreover, I don\u2019t know when I lost my mask. I\u2019m afraid people would recognize me on the way. I\u2019m squatting in a corner burying my face and can\u2019t take a taxi!\u201dAfter a pause, he said with grievance, \u201cI\u2019m weak, pitiful and helpless!\u201dYu Qinghuan said coldly, \u201cYes, but stupid and gluttonous.\u201dZhao Qingyuan, \u201c...\u201dAfter a few seconds of silence, he finally couldn\u2019t hold it and said, \u201cJust give me a word, will you come or not? If not, you\u2019ll just wait for collect my body tonight.\u201dYu Qinghuan held his forehead, \u201cFind a warm place to stay, don\u2019t be silly standing outside, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201dHaving said that, he hung up the phone and said to Yu Xin, \u201cGe, change the route and go to the car wash.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Yu Xin\u2019s complexion was complicated. After stopping for a moment, he said to Yu Qinghuan suddenly, \u201cSeriously, Qinghuan. Won\u2019t you really consider defriending him?\u201dYu Xin was afraid Zhao Qingyuan would lower the IQ of his koi Qinghuan.\u201cA-hem,\u201d Yu Qinghuan coughed and said against his will, \u201cQingyuan is a nice guy.\u201dAt this time, Huo Qu was practicing hard to recognize the way. However, he already felt struggled walking from the security booth to the downstairs of his house.His brain, which was as accurate as a computer, could not even remember the road as a child could do. No matter how many times he tried, he still couldn\u2019t find the road accurately.\u201cQu, let\u2019s quit,\u201d Huo Rong felt distressed looking at his younger brother\u2019s blue face and grabbed him. \u201cIt\u2019s not late to practice it when the weather is warmer.\u201dHuo Qu shook his head and firmly pushed Huo Rong\u2019s hand away.He must learn to recognize the way. He wanted that he could find Qinghuan no matter where he was, instead of just waiting for others to take him there.It was not a big deal. Huo Qu sipped his lips and took another step. He could learn everything for Qinghuan.Under the bright street lamp, the shadow of Huo Qu was pulled very long, and the soft light was cast on his focused side face, which made the outline of his face more profound and handsome.Huo Rong looked at his brother\u2019s determined side face and suddenly realized that Huo Qu was no longer the simple and self-closed boy who could only be protected by him. He had become better and had the person he wanted to protect. No matter how unwilling he was, he could not stop his brother\u2019s change.Huo Rong sighed and remembered Yu Qinghuan\u2019s flawless and beautiful face. No matter what Huo Qu\u2019s real thoughts were or what they would be like in the future, he had decided to support them two.After all, in this world, only Yu Qinghuan could change Huo Qu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Soon they arrived at Chongshang Wash, and he instantly recognized Zhao Qingyuan who was hanging on the door frame like a gecko.Yu Xin wanted to get off the car. But on seeing this scene, he immediately closed the door and said to Yu Qinghuan, \u201cHe is your friend. You\u2019d better go by yourself.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat on earth had Zhao Qingyuan done? Even Yu Xin was sick of him now!After wearing his mask, Yu Qinghuan got off the car, directly went straight to Zhao Qinghuan, and brought him onto the car cleanly.\u201cYou finally come. I\u2019m nearly frozen.\u201d Zhao Qingyuan put his hands at his mouth to warm them with his breaths. After opening the back door nimbly and seeing Wang Ruirui, his eyes shone and he then lowered his head and hop in, \u201cOur little princess is also here.\u201d\u201cUncle Qingyuan,\u201d called Wang Ruirui with her sweet voice. She then passed her cookie to Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s mouth.Zhao Qingyuan directly picked it up with his mouth. He said while chewing, \u201cLittle princess, you should call me brother Qingyuan. See? You also call him brother Qinghuan.\u201dWang Ruirui looked at him smilingly, \u201cIt\u2019s uncle.\u201dZhao Qingyuan tilted his head, \u201cBe good. Call me brother.\u201dWang Ruirui shook her head, \u201cIt\u2019s uncle.\u201dZhao Qingyuan, \u201cBe good, sweetheart, call me brother.\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe really couldn\u2019t bear to see Zhao Qingyuan being silly. He then glanced at him bitterly and ridiculed, \u201cYou really hit it off with Ruirui.\u201dHowever, he still overestimated Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s IQ. He didn\u2019t notice his tone at all. Instead, he asked him, \u201cYou can also tell I\u2019m welcomed among kids, right?\u201dYu Qinghuan, \u201c\u2026\u201dWherever Zhao Qingyuan was, it\u2019d be pretty lively. He not only shared that big bag of snacks with Wang Ruirui but also played games with her. You even couldn\u2019t tell their age difference.Yu Qinghuan held his forehead. He and Yu Xin looked at each other through the rearview mirror, and saw the despair in each other\u2019s eyes.\u201cWell, Qinghuan, I heard the series of Ada\u2019s watch you endorsed sells pretty well. Haven\u2019t they given you a big red envelope?\u201d Seeing Wang Ruirui was a bit tired after playing games with him for too long, Zhao Qingyuan put her on his lap, tilted his head and asked.\u201cHm?\u201d Yu Qinghuan was caught dumbfounded and immediately shook his head, \u201cNo.\u201dHe had been so busy with the shooting of Orange these days that he had no time to care about it.The sales volume is out? And it looks good? He really had no idea.\"Oh fuck!\u201d Zhao Qingyuan couldn't help swearing, \u201cThat son of bitch Evenson is so stingy! The new normcore series has only been released and already surpassed the last whole quarterly. Such conspicuous performance and he showed nothing?\u201dGenerally speaking, when the products sell pretty well, the brand will give some rewards to the stars who endorse it, so as to win a longer term cooperation in the future. Ada is also one of the top brands, which should not be so petty.Yu Qinghuan also understood this rule and thought about it.\" I will go to Ada to take group photos tomorrow. I guess Evenson will save the words for that occasion.\"\"Probably.\" Zhao Qingyuan shrugged his shoulders indifferently. When he saw that those cars on both sides kept exceeding them, Zhao Qingyuan couldn\u2019t help but complained to Yu Qingyuan, \u201cCan\u2019t you change a new car? Such second-hand Audi\u2026\u201dAfter a pause, Zhao Qingyuan euphemistically expressed his detesting, \u201cisn\u2019t it a bit difficult to drive?\u201d\"I don't drive.\" Yu Qinghuan hung his eyes, concealing the expression in them.When Zhao Qingyuan was about to ask what the situation was, he saw that Yu Xin was desperately winking at him through the rearview window, he immediately understood, and shut his mouth.Yu Qinghuan's parents died in a car accident, and his shadow on cars was quite understandable.Blaming himself for being gossipy, Zhao Qingyuan pursed his lips uneasily. When he was about to switch the topic to break the ice, an upbeat ringing was heard.\"Park the car, I need to answer a phone call.\" Yu Xin saw it was a strange number. Afraid that it was some kind of important cooperation for Yu Qinghuan, so he pulled over the car and then pressed the answer key.\"Hello, I am Tony, the guy in charge of Chicly's Asian region, and I have contacted Qinghuan before.\" after making a brief self-introduction, Tony directly got to the point,\" I want to invite Qinghuan to be our brand partner, I wonder if you are interested.\"Compared to his previous swaggering appearance, his posture was extremely low now, actually in a claptrap way.In fact, it was not strange that Tony's attitude changed so abruptly. When Yu Xin contacted him last time, Yu Qinghuan was still a little known star.Actually he was satisfied with Yu Qinghuan\u2019s image and meant to hire him as the spokesman of their windbreaker. It had been settled already actually, but his boss squeezed someone who had connections and then Yu Qinghuan\u2019s endorsement came to nothing.Although he felt kind of sorry, but also not too reluctant to give him up.

Tony nearly regretted to death, but the windbreaker commercial had been released. It was already too late to change Yu Qinghuan back. Now he could only make this call at the fastest speed trying to make things up.\"In the future, we will lend Qinghuan our clothes and ornaments first. And the fee of this cooperation is not a problem.\"Seeing Yu Xin didn't respond for a long time, Tony added another sentence.Generally speaking, the so-called partnership between stars and big brands is mutually beneficial, that is, the stars had the priority to borrow the clothes of the brand and helped promote the brand when necessary.However, they are not the spokespersons of the brand, so the brand does not need to pay any extra endorsement fee to the stars, and even in this kind of relationship, the low position is usually the stars.So one could say Tony had already showed the greatest sincerity.On hearing that, Yu Xin then looked back to Yu Qinghuan.He was on speakerphone from the very beginning, so what Tony said was also heard by Yu Qinghuan.Seeing Yu Xin\u2019s inquiring look, he shook his head in silence.Yu Xin immediately understood the meaning of his own artist and smiled cunningly, eyes narrowed. Not only did he politely refuse Tony's proposal, but he even mentioned Yu Qinghuan's current popularity tactfully.Saying that several big brands were negotiating with him, so he temporarily could not pick up so many activities, and asked for his forgiveness, and other irrelevant things.In Tony's sighing, he hung up the phone cleanly.\"At first they told me you\u2019d be their new spokesman, and immediately signed someone else behind my back, and kicked us out with just a phone call. Now they regret it?\u201d Yu Xin snorted, \u201cIt\u2019s too late!\u201dAt first Yu Qinghuan still echoed now and then. But at last Yu Xin was completely drowned in his face slapping, Yu Qinghuan could only remind him, \u201cGe, you should drive. Ruirui hasn\u2019t had supper.\u201d\"Oh right! How could I forget about this?\" Yu Xin patted his head. When he was about to start the engine, Zhao Qingyuan looked outside surprisingly, \u201cOh man! What is going on there?\u201dYu Qinghuan followed the direction he pointed at and saw the roadside under the tree stood a man dressed in black, by his side parked an Maserati having tire burst on both sides.\"This dude fell on his evil day today.\" Zhao Qingyuan sighed with emotion: \u201cMaserati has two flat tires at the time! This is really something rare to see.\"\"Maybe he got into emergency situation unexpected.\" Yu Qinghuan responded, and his eyes still stayed on that person. He didn\u2019t know why that guy looked kind of familiar.That person was talking on the phone with his back against them. Maybe something bad happened. After he hung up his phone, he rubbed his forehead while kicked on the body of the car, looking quite irritated.Cars came and went, but none stopped to ask him what was going on.These days it had a severe temperature drops and it had reached over -10 degree. Plus the strong piercing cold wind today. Yu Qinghuan wanted to ignore it but finally his conscience triumphed. He then said to Yu Xin, \u201cGe, I\u2019ll go check on him. It\u2019s not good to stand by the road on such a cold day.\u201dYu Xin was already used to his own artist liking of meddling in other\u2019s business. On hearing him, he unfastened safety belt and hopped of the car.\"Can I help you?\" Yu Qinghuan walked over, and said to that guy, \u201cWhen we parked our car, I saw you got a situation here.\u201dAfter a moment\u2019s silence, that man said, \u201cIf it\u2019s convenient of you, please give me a ride.\u201d He then explained to Yu Qinghuan, \u201cThe rear tire burst, so the chassis is too low to be towed. So the tow truck driver also could do nothing. It\u2019s really cold today. I can\u2019t stay here outside for too long. I have to go back and then try to figure it out.\u201dThe extremely familiar sound made Yu Qinghuan lost in thought. After a few seconds, he responded and then led him to his car.He never expected that he would meet his only friend in his previous life understand such circumstances.When Yu Qinghuan just made his name, Qing Zheng had already been a super star. Even when he climbed to the A list in the entertainment circle, his status was far behind Qing Zheng.He thought he would never have any connections with him in this life. But you know, fate was really a wonderful thing.Once Qing Zheng got into the car, Zhao Qingyuan recognized him, \u201cQin Zheng?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So they were quite familiar with each other.\u201dZhao Qingyuan?\u201d The hand Qing Zhen used to take of the mask paused. It seemed he also never expected he would meet Zhao Qingyuan in such a shabby second-hand Audi. But he only paused a bit and immediately said hello.The back seats were not enough. So Zhao Qingyuan volunteered to move to the shotgun holding Wang Ruirui. But even he didn\u2019t sit with them, his mouth never stopped. Before Qing Zheng introduced himself, he had already gave a detailed introduction for him.\u201dQinghuan, you should know Qing Zheng, right? The one who often hits the headline!\u201dBefore Yu Qinghuan could answer his question, he already opened his mouth trying to introduce him to Qing Zheng himself, but suddenly Qin Zheng cut in with kind of strange voice, \u201cQinghuan? Yu Qinghuan???\u201dYu Qinghuan was dumbfounded and then said with a complicated tone, \u201cQing\u2026Brother Zheng, you know me?\u201dQin zheng smiled and held out his right hand to him. \u201cYes, I am the spokesman of the delicate watch series of Ada.\"After they sent Qing zheng to his designated place, Zhao Qingyuan sat back beside the Yu Qinghuan, saying with an unbelieving tone, \u201cHow is that possible? You two are really predestined.\"\"Yes,\" Yu Qinghuan sighed, \u201cFortunately, I went down to have a look at him.\"Zhao Qingyuan was not interested in Qin Zheng, so, soon he already forgot about him and turned to discuss what they were going to eat for dinner with Yu Qinghuan.And when they went to have a meal, Qin Zheng's agent had finally received him.\u201cTomorrow I\u2019m gonna change your car.\u201d Said Chen Ming, frowning, \u201cFortunately you met a good soul. Otherwise God knows what the media would write about you if they know.\u201d After a pause, he continued, \u201cAre those people who sent you back no hidden paparazzi?\u201d\u201dHmm.\u201d With Yu Qinghuan\u2019s bright and black eyes crossing in his mind, Qin Zheng curled his lips slightly, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d Chen Ming exhaled a breath of relief. After a pause, he then said, \u201cWell, that Yu Qinghuan who endorses the normcore series of Ada, do you remember him? He is only a little star who got his beginner\u2019s luck! How dare he climb up on your shoulder?\u201dChen Ming snorted, \u201cWon\u2019t you take group photos with him tomorrow? I\u2019ve already got the press release prepared. I promise we\u2019ll gonna teach him a good lesson.\u201dThe norecore series was only the low-end watch of Ada. It was normal it had a better sales than the exquisite series. But Yu Qinghuan\u2019s fans didn\u2019t know the situation and were celebrating.Chen Ming\u2019s eyes sunk. Do they really think his own artist would be so easily bullied? Yu Qinghuan is so dead to him!\u201cDon\u2019t even lay a finger on him!\u201d warned Qin Zheng while giving Chen Ming a cold look.\u201cBut why?\u201d Chen Ming looked at him, confused, \u201cAre you really willing to be stepped on by a little star and do nothing?\u201d\u201dWhat do you mean?\u201d Qin Zheng\u2019s eyes sunk, \u201cIf I even have to bother about such small things. I\u2019m afraid even dozens of press releases a day won\u2019t be enough.\u201dAfter a pause, seeing Chen Ming\u2019s unhappy face, Qin Zheng patted on the table and said in a low voice, \u201cChen Ming, don\u2019t try to sing a different tune.\u201dChen Ming stiffened and bowed his head respectfully. \u201cYeah, I know.\"The second day, after entrusting Yu Xin to take care of Wang Ruirui at home, Yu Qinghuan took Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s car to Ada. When they entered Ada\u2019s studior, they saw Qing Zheng.\"Brother Zheng,\" Yu Qinghuan stopped and called respectfully.\"Don't be so polite, just take me as a friend.\" Qin Zheng looked up to Yu Qinghuan, sitting on a sofa beside the door.His face was deep and handsome, and he was now dressed in a black suit and his long legs were crossed, making him extra charming.Yu Qinghuan smiled and nodded.Since having cooperated many times in their previous life, and they were friends, Yu Qinghuan was quite familiar with Qing Zheng\u2019s style and knew how to cooperate with him. Even the photographers were amazed at their tacit understanding.This set of photos went exceptionally well, almost none of them was qualified.When they finished, it was noon. Qin zheng looked at his watch and said to Yu Qinghuan, \"Let's have lunch together. We may have a chance to work together. So it\u2019d do both of us good to know each other well.\u201dWhen Yu Qinghuan just want to nod, a familiar voice was suddenly rose from behind,\u201cQinghuan!\" He turned back, stunned, only saw that Huo Qu was staring at his direction, wearing a freezing cold face.Beside him, Huo Zheng stood there, helplessly. Seeing that Yu Qinghuan cast his eyes at them, he shrugged his shoulder innocently.\"What are you doing here? Yu Qinghuan walked over and asked.Huo Qu did not answer him. His face was tight and his brows were furrowed. His eyes were fixed on Qin Zheng, with a solemn and murderous intention in them.Somehow, when he saw Qin Zheng and Yu Qinghuan together, Huo Qu instinctively perceived the crisis, which was not that kind of jealousy of the familiarity between Yu Xin and Yu Qinghuan, nor of the closeness between Zhao Qingyuan and him, but of another kind of deadly threat, so that he instantly raised a 120% percent vigilance.It was as if a small beast had met an enemy. At the same time, it was on guard, while burning up inside its body.He stepped forward and stood before Yu Qinghuan, making sure that Qin Zheng couldn't see a hair of his head. Then he turned back and asked coldly, \"Qinghuan, who is he?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But facing such a situation, he only thought he couldn\u2019t lose to Qin Zheng, so he also learnt to nod back at Qing Zheng.\"Are you going to have dinner together?\"Huo Qu turned to Yu Qinghuan, asking him with a low voice.\"Yeah.\" Yu Qinghuan responded. Seeing him wearing that wronged face, he restrained himself and asked, \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d\"I miss you,\" \u2019\u201d\u201dHuo Qu replied without thinking. He then gave Qin Zheng on his other side a glimpse and then lowered his voice, \u201cwhile you are going to have dinner with someone else.\u201dAfter a pause, he added pathetically, \"I haven't even had breakfast.\"\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you have breakfast?\u201d He immediately won Yu Qinghuan\u2019s sympathy. Yu Qinghuan ignored his first sentence and blamed him while giving him a look, \u201cDo you hate you have a too functional stomach?\u201d\u201cQinghuan,\u201d Huo Qu grasped his wrist and said with am imploring tone, \u201ctake me with you. I also want to eat some food.\u201dHuo Rong who was standing aside, \u201c\u2026\u201dIf he recalled it right, his young brother ate two bowls of pumpkin porridge, and a pork pie! So here comes the problem? Since when did his younger brother who had never lied learn to tell lies?He gave Huo Qu a complicated look, sighing in his heart. Suddenly he found that his white paper like young brother was actually a sly fox or wolf or what\u2026.This totally overturned his cognition.\u201cOf course you are coming with us.\u201d Yu Qinghuan touched his head and then turned to Qin Zheng, \u201cGe, do you mind we share a table?\u201d\"Of course not.\" Qin Zheng laughed. \u201cYour friend is my friend. Besides, Huo Rong and I have met before.\u201dYu Qinghuan felt that he was implying something, but couldn\u2019t figure it out. So he could only nod and skip this topic.As they spoke, Huo Qu's eyes kept circling around Qin Zheng, as if assessing the weight class of the enemy. While Qin Zheng, while Yu Qinghuan took his eyes away from him, would immediately stare back at Huo Qu.Huo Qu also didn\u2019t show a bit of guilty after being busted. He only looked at Qin Zheng right into his eyes unyieldingly.Yu Qinghuan the dumb one didn\u2019t notice the \u2018undercurrent\u2019 at all. He was worried that Huo Qu might have a stomach and was focusing on a suitable restaurant on his phone.Fortunately there was a private home cuisine downstairs. So Qu Qinghuan took them there and asked for a private room.When choosing a seat, Huo Qu performed what was \u2018quick, resolute and accurate\u2019 to the extreme. Before everyone made any reactions, he already rushed forward and settled his ass next to Yu Qinghuan.Qin Zheng who was about to pull out the chair, \"... \"He suddenly had a feeling that this logy imp was not easy to tackle with.He narrowed his eyes and settled down to sit on the opposite side of the Yu Qinghuan.Since Huo Qu had always so clingy to him, Yu Qinghuan didn\u2019t notice anything wrong at all. He shoved the menu the waiter out on a corner of the table to Qin Zheng, \u201cGe, order the dishes you like. I\u2019m all good.\u201d\u201dOK.\u201d Qin Zheng took the menu, lips curled, casting a glance at Huo Qu smilingly.Huo Qu was already unhappy since Yu Qinghuan gave the menu to Qin Zheng First. And now provoked by his stare, Huo Qu felt more upset now.Although he didn\u2019t why, Huo Qu was pretty sure he didn\u2019t like this person since the first sight.He even wished that he could cover his eyes so he would never see Qinghuan!\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Huo Qu?\u201d Speaking of which, Yu Qinghuan put his own menu in front of him and turned a page. When he was about to ask what he was gonna eat, he saw that Huo Qu was in a daze. So he elbowed him gently and asked him with a smile, \u201cHunger stole your brain?\u201d\"I...\" Huo Qu opened his mouth unwillingly. When he was about to ask why Yu Qinghuan gave the menu to Qin Zheng first, his eyes suddenly shone and he immediately turned from sorrowful to overjoyed.Qin Zheng was looking at the menu alone while Qinghuan was sharing the same menu with him!So who was closer to Qinghuan was quite obvious now!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he had grown a tail from behind, it should be wagging victoriously.\u201cOK.\u201d Yu Qinghuan had no idea why his emotions had changed so fast and he was disinclined to care about it. When he saw the dishes following Huo Qu\u2019s finger, he was struck dumb.Huo Qu ordered Sweet and Sour Spare Ribs and fried shrimps with cashew nuts, both of which were his favorites.\"You like these, too?\" Yu Qinghuan flipped down the page, pretending to ask casually.\"Huh?\" Huo Qu froze for a moment, then shook his head, No.\" He had no preference for food.\u201dThen why are you ordering these?\u201d Then when Yu Qinghuan was about to ask the waiter to cancel those two dishes, Huo Qu said reasonably, \u201cBut you like.\u201dAt that moment, Yu Qinghuan could not describe how he felt. He just felt he became much light, sore and swollen inside the nose, and could barely hold his tears that were going to pop out.He lowered his head to hide his gaffe, and after quite a while he started to go through the menu again.Huo Rong who was sitting beside got shocked again!Has his brother become so considerate and thoughtful now? He even remembers what those who are close to him like eating?Thinking of this, his silly brother was beside himself with excitement. He rubbed his hands and looked at Huo Qu with emotions, \u201cQu, help me order a dish.\u201d\"Ah!\"Huo Qu raised his head in a daze and seemed to be at a loss about his request. After a few seconds, he nodded. \"Ok, what do you want to eat?\"Huo Qu, who had been immersed in excitement, now nearly got a heart attack, \u201cHuh? Don't you know what the second elder brother wants to eat?\"Huo Qu\u2019s face remained unchanged, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201dHuo Rong,\"... \"Looking at her brother's handsome face without any guilt, Huo Rong whispered, \u201cYou don\u2019t know? Then what do you know?\u201dHe thought his voice was small enough, but Huo Qu still heard him.Huo Qu answered his question honestly, \"I know what Qinghuan likes to eat.\"Huo Rong, \"... \"Brother!!! Actually you don't have to answer it!!Those people waited for a while, and the dishes were all served.Those four men were all big eaters. Their table was covered with all kinds of dishes. But unfortunately almost all the dishes Yu Qinghuan liked were put before Qin Zheng.Nothing was more important than eating in the world. Yu Qinghuan never remained reserved before food. He directly stretched his chopsticks into that plate of fried shrimps with cashew nuts. But the ferric chopsticks were too slippery, so he failed.Putting down his chopsticks, Yu Qinhuan rolled up his sleeves and was about to change to a spoon when Qin Zheng scooped up a spoonful of shrimps and put them in his bowl.\"Thank you, ge.\" Yu Qinhuan picked up a shrimp and put it in his mouth, secretly sighing in his heart whether it was ten years ago or now, Qin Zheng was always so thoughtful.In the previous life when they ate food, Qin Zheng was also like this, always tried to take care of him.The private cuisines here were really not bad. The shrimps were sweet and delicious. After eating one, Yu Qinghuan immediately stuffed another one into his mouth, which made Huo Qu rather anxious now.Imitating what Qin Zheng did, he also tried to pick up dishes for Yu Qinghuan.Pity that he couldn\u2019t use a spoon well, plus that he was a little anxious in his heart, he just couldn\u2019t spoon things out. Finally he even got cold sweat on his forehead.\"Here, eat.\u201d While Huo Qu was hot and bothered, Yu Qinghuan suddenly scooped a spoon of shrimps and put them in his bow, saying gently, \u201cWhat else do you wanna eat?\u201dHuo Qu looked at his smiling face, and bang, the light in his head was illuminated!Couldn\u2019t use a spoon proficiently = Qinghuan picked up dishes for him in personIn other words --Sometimes disadvantages would also turn into disadvantages!Eyes lowered, Huo Qu wore a light smile, and again showed that little dimple on his left cheek. When he raised his eyes again, it was only left the innocence on his face already, \u201cQinghuan, I want that, and that\u2026\u201dAfter a pause, he bit his chopsticks and asked tentatively, \u201cWill you pick up all of them for me?\"\u201cWhat else?\u201d Yu Qinghuan looked at him wearing a smile, \u201cYou can\u2019t use chopsticks.\u201dDuring the whole meal, using this method, Huo Qu successfully draw all Yu Qinghuan\u2019s attention on himself. One was responsible to pick up dishes while the other one was responsible for only eating. They acted like there were only the two of them on the table.Qin zheng's eyes look slightly sunk. Looking at the undisguised gloat in Huo Qu\u2019s eyes, he felt kind of sullen.No the reason, he just couldn\u2019t learn his move. Even if he could learn it, he had no face to use it.During a meal\u2019s time, everyone was holding his own thoughts.

Even if Qin Zheng had a good impression of him in this life, their relationship was different from that of the previous life, so there was no reason he should let Qin Zheng pay.However, Qin Zheng thought he was the senior, plus he had a good impression of Yu Qinghuan, of course he should pay.Neither of them could convince each other. When Yu Qinghuan was thinking whether he should take a step back, Huo Qu suddenly stretch out to hold his hand, \u201cQinghuan, I have paid. Let\u2019s go.\u201dHuo Rong, who just received the bank card from the cashier, \u201c\u2026\u201dHe was the one who paid, OK? Since when did his little brother become so not adorable!\"Huh?\" Hearing Huo Qu, Yu Qinghuan suddenly didn\u2019t know how to respond. After quite a few seconds, he nodded and found Huo Qu was already dragging him to leave.\"Wait a minute,\" Yu Qinghuan asked him to stop and then turned back to Qin Zheng, \u201cGe, where are you going?\u201d\u201cSolving the car issue first.\u201d Qin Zheng lowered his head and smiled at him, \u201cYou have my numbers now. Call me! And come to me if you need me.\u201d\"Thank you, ge.\" Yu Qinghuan then smiled back at him. When he was about to say something, Huo Qu already dragged him out urgently.Yu Qinghuan felt a little embarrassed and could only say goodbye to Qin Zheng and follow Huo Qu\u2019s steps.He didn't see that as soon as he caught up, Huo Qu suddenly turned around and gave Qin Zheng a look.That pair of cold and provoking eyes were filled with dense warning, like a fierce and brutal cub.After Yu Qinghuan and Qin Zheng\u2019s group photo was released on Ada\u2019s Weibo, it immediately caused a sensation.No one expected that the spokesman of Ada would be Qin Zheng.Yu Qinghuan was really lucky. He only endorsed a low branch watch of a big brand and could already be related to Qin Zheng, which made a lot of people jealous.Qin Zheng was not a little fresh meat who relied on his face or an idol type with no acting skills.He was 33 years old this year, who not only had wonderful acting skills, but also elected as the World\u2019s Hot 100 Men every year, definitely one of the hottest actor in the entertainment circle. So many little star out there wanted to have connections with him.However, Qin Zheng had always kept a low profile and no one knew his schedule at all. Not only that, o avoid being tied up and hyped up, Qin Zheng almost never got too close to anyone. So such close photo was really a rare thing to him.[Ah!!!!!! Zheng stuns me so much that I couldn\u2019t help spreading my legs for him! Now I believe Yu Qinghuan is a real koi!][My Zheng! I wanna marry you!!][Ah, my two husbands appear in one photo!. Which one should I pick to take home tonight? Waiting online! Emergency!][Wake up! Don\u2019t daydream!]\"Qinghuan has really lost a lot of weight! Alas! In order to shoot \u201cOrange\u201d, he really put a lot in it. He has my knees!]\u2026However, there was far than that. Qin Zheng forwarded this Weibo and @Yu Qinguan, which only happened once in a blue moon.Qin Zheng V: @Yu Qinghuan, happy cooperation. Let\u2019s have dinner together next time! [HANDSHAKE]!This time those excited netizens felt like their blood boiling![I don't know why. Suddenly I smell kind of special bromance\u2026][Suddenly I feel kind of emotional. I think Zheng and Qinghuan really hit it off. I have been following him for five years. This is the first time he supports a junior.][I can\u2019t hold my tears. My Zheng finally has a friend in the circle. Say no more. Only for this, I\u2019m gonna support Qinghuan my whole life.]\u2026Due to an update on Weibo from Qin Zheng, Yu Qinghuan\u2019s followers boomed, plus the followers before, now it broke 10 million!By rights, when a star\u2019s followers broke 10 million or 20 million on Weibo, he should say something or send some photos or presented the autographed photos to thank the fans. But having been waiting for a few days, Yu Qinghuan still hadn\u2019t updated his Weibo, no news at all.By the end, the fans were all desperate.Although it was a good thing for their idol to keep a low profile, they should at least updated his Weibo now and then or even sent a photo or what.If Yu Qinghuan had not posted two or three tweets before, they would have thought it was a dead account.In desperation, those capable fans unexpectedly had busted Yu Xin\u2019s Weibo and urged him to urge Qinghuan.Yu Xin felt both funny and annoying and could only hand his phone before Yu Qinghuan, saying, \"You have some pity on your fans. See? .They even ask your photos under my Weibo.\u201dYu Qinghuan just finished his shooting, and still didn\u2019t get a minute\u2019s rest. On hearing him, he said, \"Didn\u2019t you take a lot of photos of me saying you wanna forward a koi? Just pick one.\"Not long the Orange crew resumed their work. After gaining a high media exposure, a lot of investors came to Zhao Rui, asking for cooperation. Even their shooting site was borrowed by the person in charge for free.Orange now only had some tail-in work, which would only cost less than a week. Besides, judging from the netizens\u2019 focus on this movie, it wouldn\u2019t flop. Now they wouldn\u2019t have to cost him a penny, and also could curry favor with Zhao Rui. Why not do it?\"Your fans want to you to send it.\" said Yu Xin.Now he was highly doubted why he insisted keeping a cold image. Maybe he had already planned it. He was just too lazy and didn\u2019t want to manage his own Weibo.\"And I see that Qin Zheng @you. At least you should forward it, or people would say you are too poised.\u201dYu Qinghuan got struck dumb, then quickly took out his phone and saw Qin Zheng\u2019s new update.He frowned. While forwarding it, he had a doubt and had a feeling that Qin Zheng was a bit strange, maybe\u2026he had a little more vigor and pushfulness?If it had been before, for Qin Zheng\u2019s personality, he would never @him and had a date for dinner on Weibo.But giving it a second thought, Yu Qinghuan found it reasonable. In his previous life Qin Zheng was already forty when he knew him, but he was only 30 in this life. Of course they were different.\u201cQinghuan, come here!\u201d Soon after Yu Qinghuan put down his phone, Zhao Rui already pushed him aside.\"Coming.\" Yu Qinghuan tidied up the costumes and hurried to the set.Like he wanted to make up for the last few days, Zhao Rui got even more excessive. He even shortened the break to 10 minutes.Fortunately, after the big explosion, everyone was full of the joy of surviving the disaster, and instead blaming his workaholic behavior, instead of complaining, they all willingly did whatever they were asked to do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He chose the top editors of the industry, working extra shifts, and finally finished the editing job in only a month.Maybe because of the raising of public\u2019s attention, Orange got the public release permit quite smoothly. On the day the result was out, Zhao Rui even shed some tears and asked Yu Qinghuan out for a drink and settled the release date on April 18th.Since Orange was Yu Qinghuan\u2019s first film released in theaters, so Zhao Qingyuan and Qin Zheng had informed him that they would attend the premiere.\u201cGe,\u201d Before they left, Chen Ming asked him, \u201cwhy are you so good to a minor star?\u201d\u201cAm I?\u201d Qin Zheng\u2019s hands that were tying the tie slightly shivered.\u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d Chen Ming listed while counting with his fingers, \u201cForget about helping him attracting more followers, now you even go to the premiere of such a shabby movie because of him?\u201dOne should know so many actors and director couldn\u2019t get him even they would like to pay a lot.\"What does shabby movie mean?\u201d Qin Zheng\u2019s sharp eyes nailed on Chen Ming, \u201cEvery movie is the great efforts of the directors and the casts\u2026\u201dBefore he finished, Chen Ming shouted, \u201clook at you! I didn\u2019t say anything and you already tried to speak for him.\u201dQin Zheng got struck dumb, frowning.All in all, he and Yu Qinghuan only met trice. Although he had a good impression of him, did he really need to defend him like this?\"Probably last life I owe him.\" Qin Zheng said jokingly, then pulled the door open and walked out.The premiere of Orange was a big success. Zhao Rui wasn\u2019t a social man. So after a very brief opening, he started the movie.Most of the people who were present had thought Orange would be a very heavy movie, but when it got on soundings, the audience found that they were wrong.The theme of Orange was very heavy, but its focus was not on that, but on healing.Zhao Qing\u2019an, who suffered from both physical and psychological blows, finally could face herself and walked out the shadow in the past under the appeasing and encouragement of her brother Zhao Qingping.In this film, however, the touching part was not only Zhao Qingping\u2019s care of his sister, but also neighborhood, and also care from school, from her teachers and classmates, and even from doctors and the judges.In the film of one hour and forty minutes, through all kinds of details, it tried to express the moving feelings between people.Sour and sweet, sweet and sadistic, very touching.Yu Qinghuan's performance was natural and smooth. He could precisely express all kinds of emotions, which easily brought the audience into the movie. Wang Ruirui\u2019s performance was also commendable. Especially her interaction with Yu Qinghuan, which earned a lot of the audience\u2019s tears.After the movie was over, no one spoke, and it was after quite a few minutes that the theater burst into thunderous applause.Three months\u2019 efforts finally got paid off. Be it Zhao Rui or Yu Qinghuan, they both felt much relieved.Now what they should do was only waiting for the audience\u2019s reaction after it was released.When Yu Qinghuan was going to get up and turn on the light, suddenly Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s sobbing came to his ears, \u201cQing, Qing, Qinghuan\u2026did you bring tissues?\"Yu Qinghuan turned around and looked right into Zhao Qingyuan\u2019s eyes that were swollen like walnuts.Yu Qinghuan: \"... \"Well, now he really had no idea whether he should feel happy or disgusted.\"Do you think I\u2019d carry tissue with me?\" Yu Qinghuan raised his brows, stretched out a hand to press his head down and intimidated him, \u201cAdjust your emotions now, or the paparazzi would shoot ugly photos of you!\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t want that!\u201d Zhao Qingyuan was still choking with sobs, \u201cI really shouldn\u2019t have come if knew it\u2019s such kind of movie, I\u2026\u201dYu Qinghuan deliberately helped him to get out of the mood affected by the movie, so he joked, \u201cWhat about you wipe your tears with the sleeve?\"\u201cYou think I don\u2019t want to?\u201d Zhao Qinghuan peered at him, \u201cBut I borrow the suit and I have to give it back later. Oh!\u201dYu Qinghuan: \"... \"So he really wanted to wipe his tears with the sleeve!?Finally, the media still captured the crying Zhao Qingyuan, which they took as a blister. After they got back, they started to focus on this point crazily, which happened to add some gimmick stunt for Orange.When being interviewed by the media receiving Qin Zheng\u2019s congrats, Yu Qinghuan collapsed onto a chair and exhaled a long breath of relief after all the honored guests left.After resting for a while, when he was about to ask zhao Rui of the next arrangements, suddenly someone sat next to him. He gave that person a casual look and immediately got his back straightened up because of great astonishment, \u201cHuo Qu, what are you doing here?\u201dHe suspected that he got dazzled by watching the movie and even rubbed his eyes childishly.Isn\u2019t Huo Qu supposed to sleep at 9? Now is already 2 in the morning! What is he doing here?\u201cI come to watch your movie of course.\u201d Huo Qu put his freezing cold hands into his palms.Yu Qinghuan asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I see you?\u201dHuo Qu smiled shyly, \u201cI was at the back. This is your time. I can\u2019t disturb you.\u201d After a pause, he looked at Yu Qinghuan\u2019s eyes, \u201cQinghuan, congratulations. I\u2019m really happy for you.\u201dYu Qinghuan was a little dumbfounded and then smiled, \u201cWho taught you to say these? Your second brother?\u201dHuo Qu nodded, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen how do you to say such words?\u201d asked Yu Qinghuan, \u201cDo you know what the movie tells us?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Huo Qu shook his head. When Yu Qinghuan picked his smile, Huo Qu said word by word, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t affect that I\u2019m proud of you.\u201dHe then said, \u201cIt\u2019s simple. You may not understand it as much as I do on stage, but it doesn't matter, because I know you'll be just as happy for me. Right, qing huan?\"After keeping silent for quite a whole, Yu Qinghuan said while restraining his rolling emotions, \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWell...if I make speech next time, will you also wait for me down there? I want you to look at\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause\u2026I also want you to be by my side when I am at the important time of my life.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Every word he uttered seemed to come from the bottom of his heart, with bare sincerity.Yu Qinghuan only felt that his heart was both itchy and painful, like a tiny bud breaking through the border of his left atrium and growing rapidly through his disorderly heartbeat.He couldn\u2019t help looking up to Huo Qu.Huo Qu was wearing a well-cut dark blue trench coat tonight. He was tall and slim. His handsome face looked deep and charming in the dim light of the screening hall, full of youthful exuberance.Seeing Yu Qinghuan looking at him, he sipped his lips and his eyelashes quivered shyly, revealing the little round dimple on his left face.The bud in Yu Qinghuan\u2019s heart seemed to have absorbed enough nutrients instantly and grew into a huge tree, stretching his chest to the brim. There was no space for anyone in his heart now apart from Huo Qu.How could this boy be so cute? His words and behaviors, or even every move of him was so charming that Yu Qinghuan could not move his eyes from him.His eyesight was depicting Huo Qu\u2019s eyes and eyebrows, as if to deeply carve Huo Qu\u2019s image in his heart.\u201cQinghuan?\u201d Under his hot stare, Huo Qu\u2019s cheeks were flushed and his ears felt burning, even the palms of his hands oozed a little damp sweat. He suddenly felt a little embarrassed and wanted to let go of Yu Qinghua\u2019s hands to wipe the sweat from his palms, but he was reluctant to do it.While he was hesitating, Yu Qinghuan had already gently drawn back his hand.\u201cI\u2019ll let Yu Xin take you back later,\u201d he said softly, looking away from Huo Qu. \u201cIt\u2019s too late, you have to go back to sleep early.\u201dHearing this, Huo Qu immediately became anxious, \u201cBut I want you to go with me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Yu Qinghuan smiled at him and pointed to Zhao Rui on the stage. \u201cDo you Director Zhao there? We have got work to do later.\u201dEncountering with Huo Qu\u2019s black and beautiful eyes, he felt his heart quiver slightly, but he could only repress the surging guilt inside. \u201cWait till I have time for you, okay?\u201dThis boy knew nothing, just like a blank sheet of paper. He was the only friend Yu Qinghuan had ever made in his life, so Yu Qinghuan used up all his sincere heart to treat Huo Qu well and took this friendship on the tip of heart. However, Yu Qinghuan had sprouted some to-be-blamed feelings for him because of this treasure.He had to give himself some time to deal with his chaotic heart, thought Yu Qinghuan.\u201cReally?\u201d Huo Qu\u2019s eyes glued to Yu Qinghuan, repeatedly confirming, \u201cQinghuan, will you really come to me soon?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d Yu Qinghuan assured him, \u201cI will definitely come to you right after I finish the movie promotion.\u201dThen Huo Qu reluctantly followed Yu Xin and left. Before going out, he looked back several times, but Yu Qinghuan kept his head down and did not notice him. He could only sip his lips and stepped out of the door under Yu Xin\u2019s urging.\u201cWon\u2019t you go with them?\u201d Zhao Rui was smoking a cigarette and looked at Yu Qinghuan, puzzled. \u201cThe day after tomorrow, we will begin our journey to several cities to publicize the movie. You should reserve your energy in advance.\u201dPerhaps the smooth post-production of Orange was much smooth, which changed Zhao Rui. Compared with his gloomy appearance three months ago, he had been much more cheerful now.At the very least, he would not keep staring at people with that bleak look now, and he would not be treated as a bad guy by parents with children on the road any more.\u201cI\u2019ll go later.\u201d Yu Qinghuan closed his eyes, looking a little tired. His head tilted back and leaned against the chair, and his voice was hoarse.\u201cDon\u2019t get sick, otherwise no one will follow me to do the movie promotion.\u201d Zhao Rui was startled by his wilting appearance. Looking around, he saw that there was no one in the screening room. He reached for his things. \u201cLet\u2019s go, I\u2019m going back, I can give you a ride.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Yu Qinghuan nodded and walked out ahead of him.Looking at his back, Zhao Rui frowned, he always felt Yu Qinghuan was kinda not in the mood today, was it his illusion?Although there were not many screenings of Orange in cinemas, the box office of the movie was much better than Zhao Rui had expected due to the popularity it created in the early stage. On the day of its screening, many netizens who had been paying close attention to the movie bought tickets in the first place and went to the cinema for it.Compared with Yu Qinghuan\u2019s calmness, Yu Xin was like an ant on a hot pan. He searched for the keywords on Weibo every few seconds. He wanted to see the movie reviews. Unfortunately, he failed to find any comments after half day\u2019s labor.Yu Xin gradually cooled his ardor.He also attended the premiere of Orange and even shed a few tears for the first time when watching the movie. He thought that the movie would at least make a small hit, but unexpectedly, the public did not respond at all.After peeking at his own artist\u2019s quiet side face, Yu Xin silently hid his mobile phone.He cheered himself up secretly in his heart. This was Yu Qinghuan\u2019s first movie, and it had a very heavy theme and not easy to please the audiences, so it was not a big deal even if it flopped. Just do well in the next movie.He did not dare to search for the film reviews any more. Yu Qinghuan was also not in the mood to search for any comment after he sensed his own thoughts on Huo Qu. Therefore, neither of them knew that a few hours later, Orange went on the hot search list.[At the beginning, I just felt that the film crew was so pitiful, so I bought a ticket to support them. Unexpectedly, I was immediately attracted by the movie itself after watching it. When I walked out of the cinema, I felt that I should write something about it, but I where to start. I think it is so good that no words could match it. I am crying in front of the computer now like an idiot. For real, go to the cinema and see it, you will never regret it.][Orange is really too warm. It\u2019s totally different from what I expected, and I still can\u2019t stop crying no. Qinghuan\u2019s acting is so fucking good. I feel what acting is for the first time on an actor. I highly recommend everyone to go to the cinema to watch it.]\u201cI\u2019d like to explain in advance that I am no paid poster and I don\u2019t think the crew have the money for that. But I have to say this movie is really too good! The lack of funds, a director with no fame, and actors from nowhere made me think I would see a very terrible movie on the big screen, but I did not expect it would give me a big surprise! I absolutely want to watch it again!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And most of the audiences said it was warm! This was simply incredible and so aroused many people\u2019s curiosity!At first, some netizens were still in hesitation. After seeing these reviews, they immediately felt itchy in their hearts. So they changed their original plans and went to the cinema.Especially, after Zhou Mingjiang, a well-known film critic, posted his review, the number of people following this trend to cinemas reached the highest.Zhou Mingjiang V: \u201cThis is the first time that I feel I don\u2019t know how to put my pen to paper after all these years of film review experience. Orange is really beyond my expectations. The last movie that touched me so much was as long as ten years ago. I won\u2019t say too much, lest you blame me to be an annoying spoiler. And I think such a good movie should really be watched at the cinema.Zhao Rui really has earned all my respect to have been able to make such a heavy subject but stuffed of love. Yu Qinghuan\u2019s acting is also exceeding my expectations. It\u2019s really not easy for a young movie star to interpret the various emotions of a role so fully. I believe I will have more understanding when I go to the cinema to watch it again tomorrow. Finally, by way of a digression, I hope my wife can give birth to a lovely girl like Wang Ruirui.\u201dZhou Mingjiang\u2019s film reviews had always been famous for their sharpness. Taking a look at his Weibo, the most recent one was to comment on a blockbuster, which claimed to have invested 200 million yuan. But he just commented a few words: What the fuck was this gadget? Shoot you to Mars!Since he strongly recommended the movie and even joked about himself, the movie should be good, thought the netizens.Holding the attitude of trying, another wave of people went to the cinema.This was how Cheng Ya was dragged by her best friend to the cinema. Until she sat down in her seat, she still had some dissatisfaction.She chewed a big mouthful of popcorn and glared at her bestie angrily, \u201cI am tired enough doing experiments every day. Why should I watch such a heavy theme movie? Can we still keep our friendship?\u201dThe physics department had a heavy workload. Cheng Ya usually had to write her homework until two or three o\u2019clock at night. Not only that, she had to get up early every day for fear of being left behind by her classmates if she was not working hard.So she envied Huo Qu\u2019s clever brain very much every time when she felt dizzy about her homework.\u201cLet\u2019s consider it as a contribution to the film crew. We\u2019ll leave in the middle.\u201d Her bestie grabbed a handful of popcorn from her popcorn pail and stuffed them into Cheng Ya\u2019s mouth, \u201cDidn\u2019t you read your Weibo? The film crew is super poor. The director and actors are so miserable. It is only a few tens of yuan anyway.\u201d\u201cThe thing is I have no time for Weibo,\u201d Cheng Ya sighed. She could not even finish her daily homework!Just as they were whispering, the movie began.The role Zhao Qing\u2019 an\u2019s tragic experience immediately let the two girls heart wrenching and they instantly entered the atmosphere created by the movie.Later, when they saw Zhao Qingping, the sad and hopeless boy, pretended to be strong, comforted his sister and cooperated with the police\u2019s investigation, their eyes became red. Seeing Zhao\u2019s neighbors\u2019 concern for Zhao Qing\u2019 an, and the group of little angels in the school who were innocent but took Zhao Qing\u2019 an as their precious care, the two girls immediately shed floods of tears.Until the ending song sounded, they were still immersed in their emotions.\u201cXiaoya,\u201d Cheng Ya\u2019s bestie pushed her, her voice still choked, \u201cLet\u2019s go, the movie is over.\u201dCheng Ya\u2019s crying eyes were swollen. She even didn\u2019t realize her scattered popcorn on the ground. When she heard this, she sobbed, \u201cI don't want to leave. I want to watch it once again!\u201d\u201cCome on,\u201d her bestie urged, \u201cNext time. We still have a class tonight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really annoying.\u201d Cheng Ya wiped her tears from the corner of her eyes and walked out with her bestie. \u201cI\u2019m going to find out who the male lead is. He was really an ideal brother! His acting is amazing! I also want such a warm brother.\u201d\u201cI just glanced at the big screen, his name is Yu Qinghuan,\u201d said her bestie.Cheng Ya\u2019s head tilted in disbelief and she muttered, \u201cI always think this name is a bit familiar.\u201d She said, while searching his name on Weibo on her phone, and when she saw key words Model CP of Hua Univ., she was eerily silent.Her bestie felt worried and could not help asking, \u201cXiaoya, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dCheng Ya sighed deeply, \u201cDo you know what the saddest thing in the world is?\u201dHer bestie, \u201c???\u201dCheng Ya, \u201cI fall in love with my rival in love.\u201dHer bestie, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe movie must have spelled a cast on its moviegoers. Even Chengya lost her mind after watching it!When the first day box office results of Orange came out Yu Xin didn\u2019t dare to look at his mobile phone. Yu Qinghuan was actually a little nervous too. After all, it was the first movie in his life released in the theaters. But when he saw Yu Xin\u2019s cowardly behavior, he was relieved immediately.He had already done what he could do for the movie. No matter what the result was, he felt no shame.Taking a deep breath, he clicked open his cell phone and was shocked when he saw the figure.\u201cHow much is it?\u201d Yu Xin\u2019s breath trembled a little. He leaned over and did not dare to look at it directly. Instead, he asked Yu Qinghuan with his face tilted.\u201cSee for yourself,\u201d Yu Qinghuan had no expression on his face, and Yu Xin could not see whether he was happy or angry. He pondered for several seconds before getting up some courage and looking at the screen.\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Yu Xin blurted out after a few seconds of silence. He rubbed his eyes and said in shock, \u201cDid Zhao Rui fake the box office?\u201d60 million on the first day of screening for such a movie? For real?Actually, apart from them, Zhao Rui also went crazy. He never dreamed that Orange would get such a result. When he saw the figure, he was so excited that he almost dropped his cell phone.Different from the film crew, the cinemas were always the shrewdest. At first, they despised the movie. Now the box office statistics had made them increase the number of screenings immediately.For now, Orange totally made a hit and became a blockbuster!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
