    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: First Arrival at Yun ChengNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosAt the end of August, the sun hung overhead and a heatwave boiled on the little town.On the second floor of the town center\u2019s health institute, a girl leaned against a slightly shabby door lazily. She wore a simple black-and-white shirt and her collar crooked when she lowered her head.Her two sleeves were folded up in an unruly manner.She wore a pair of low-rise jeans below. It was a little old and exposed her thin and delicate waist due to her movements.Her appearance was simply eye-catching.When the nurse saw a man pass by the girl for the third time, she handed the girl a lollipop and snorted towards the ward. \u201cRan Ran, are your parents here?\u201dQin Ran lowered her head to tear into the sugar coating. Her long eyelashes drooped slightly and she only squinted her eyes in reply when it was in her mouth. \u201cProbably.\u201dThe nurse snorted. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell.\u201dShe then hurried away with the medical record.Inside the ward were Qin Ran\u2019s biological parents, Ning Qing and Qin Hanqiu.The two had already divorced more than a decade ago. Qin Ran had always followed her grandmother, who had fallen ill and had to transfer hospitals. Thus, Ning Qing and Qin Hanqiu had returned.Qin Ran leaned against the wall, one leg curled slightly as she listened expressionlessly.Through the door, Ning Qing\u2019s indifferent voice could be heard. \u201cQin Hanqiu, my mother is in serious condition. I will take her to Yun Cheng for treatment.\u201dQin Hanqiu looked at her with a complicated expression, seemingly mocking her. \u201cRan Ran dropped out of school and no school in Ninghai Town has accepted her. You can take her to the Lin family. They have connections and will definitely find a good school for her.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already brought Yu\u2019er into the Lin family, yet you want me to bring another child in? What will the Lin family think of me?\u201d Ning Qing was a little annoyed with his endless pestering. Which school would easily accept a student like Qin Ran?Speaking of this, Qin Hanqiu was clearly resentful. \u201cI wanted to take Yu\u2019er with me back then. You\u2019re pushing Ran Ran to me just because you don\u2019t want her?\u201dThey had two daughters. Qin Ran and Qin Yu were only one year apart, but they were worlds apart in other areas.They had fought relentlessly for Qin Yu\u2019s custody when they filed for divorce. In the end, Qin Yu wanted to follow her mother and the case was finally closed.At that time, no one wanted Qin Ran. The two evaded her custody and didn\u2019t care about her in the end.Grandmother Chen Shulan had taken pity on Qin Ran. Thus, she raised her alone for twelve years.In the ward, Ning Qing looked at the mocking face of Qin Hanqiu and suppressed her anger. Compared to Qin Yu, who wanted to take in a daughter who only fought? Furthermore, she would have to take her into a prestigious family, and Ning Qing was reluctant at having to be mocked at.Qin Hanqiu had been abducted into their town when he was a kid. Chen Shulan fancied Qin Hanqiu as a poor boy. But after being married for a few years, Ning Qing couldn\u2019t stand Qin Hanqiu\u2019s lack of ambitions. Besides hard labor, he could only work on construction sites. Ning Qing might as well divorce him.After their divorce, Ning Qing brought Qin Yu along in her marriage to a rich man in Yun Cheng.Qin Hanqiu also quickly remarried. He had a son with his current wife and led a prosperous life.Qin Hanqiu had nothing to lose, while Ning Qing was afraid that he would really go to the Lin family\u2019s house and embarrass her, so she unwillingly took Qin Ran back to Yun Cheng.\u201cRan Ran, you.\u201d Qin Hanqiu came out of the ward door, saw Qin Ran, and paused. He sighed. \u201cThe Lin family is rich. Follow your mother and they will definitely find you a good high school for you. You might even enter university in the future.\u201dWith Qin Ran\u2019s grades, could she even enter university\u2026 Qin Hanqiu only said it casually.Qin Hanqiu had a son now and it was not a small responsibility. They had yet to buy a house in the city and still had to plan for the future.His current wife had ordered him beforehand not to take Qin Ran back.Qin Ran leaned back further. There was no air-conditioning in the corridor of the hospital and the sultry air was condensed. She lowered her head and wrapped her fingers around the second white jade button on her collar.Her fingers were slender and free of impurities, like a frozen jade wrapped in the cold.Her incredibly pretty eyebrows were cold and dry.She ignored Qin Hanqiu and, after unbuttoning the button, narrowed her eyes and looked towards the window facing her in the hallway, her eyes cold.A few meters away from the window was an office.Opposite the office.The young man sitting on the chair was dressed in a white coat of asceticism. His face was clean and his figure handsome and slender.He was the new director of the hospital, Jiang Dongye.Jiang Dongye glanced at the high-end sofa across him that did not match the hospital.A man was lying on the sofa with a cigarette pinched between his long and defined fingers. Pale smoke rose thinly from his folded arms and his eyes seemed to be frozen in place for half a minute.Jiang Dongye followed his line of sight. \u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201dThe man was wearing a black silk shirt and was nestled on the sofa. He leaned into the sofa and smiled. \u201cQuite a thin waist.\u201dHe turned his head to the side. His nose was very high and his skin extremely white. His eyes were half squinted, and his very long eyelashes covered the bottom of his eyes.As if he had just woken, his voice was hoarse and low, with a hint of inadvertent clarity.His voice was clear.\u201cHuh?\u201d Jiang Dongye flipped through the pages of his medical record and didn\u2019t understand him.He looked up at his outstandingly charming appearance and thought it wasn\u2019t difficult to understand why all the men and women in this city were crazy for this Third Master.\u201cNone of your business.\u201d Cheng Juan straightened his long legs, leaned on the sofa and chuckled. Then, he said, \u201cReturn to Beijing once you have finished your mission in two days.\u201d\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Jiang Dongye returned to his senses.His bony fingers pressed the cigarette into the ashtray.Cheng Juan stood up, his legs long and straight, his eyes narrowed with mist. He reached out and patted the imaginary ashes and said dismissively, \u201cI have another mission.\u201d**The Ning family\u2019s car was just downstairs.It was a black BMW with Yun Cheng\u2019s license plate number.After negotiating with the doctor, Ning Qing directly took Qin Ran and Chen Shulan back to Yun Cheng.\u201cThe Lin family has a lot of rules. Don\u2019t bring your bad habits to the Lin family, do you hear me?\u201d Ning Qing tilted her head and rubbed her brows.Qin Ran only carried a black backpack which she put on her lap. She squinted a little sleepily and nodded indifferently.She had a pair of thin and straight legs.She carried the air of a bandit from head to toe and Ning Qing wasn\u2019t sure if she even processed her words.\u201cWhy are you so sleepy? Did you steal something last night?\u201d Ning Qing had been a noblewoman for twelve years in the Lin family and was now extremely graceful.What she hated most was the air of banditry that Qin Ran had in common with Qin Hanqiu.Qin Ran took out a pair of black headphones from her pocket and didn\u2019t care much. \u201cI spent the night playing games at an internet cafe.\u201dAs she looked up, the half-slung headphones slid to her collar and hung on her neck.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2019re not allowed to go to internet cafes in the future!\u201d Ning Qing looked at her improper appearance and gritted her teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t be so rebellious. If you were half as good as Yu\u2019er, I wouldn\u2019t be nagging you so much. The Lin family is different from your grandmother. Your words and deeds will affect your younger sister. Even if you don\u2019t care about yourself, don\u2019t drag Yu\u2019er down.\u201dAt the thought of having to find connections and have Lin Qi put Qin Ran into the senior year, Ning Qing became more and more irritable.With Qin Ran\u2019s current situation, she was afraid that even if they searched the whole of Yun Cheng, no school would be willing to accept her.She had depended on her good looks to marry Lin Qi, a real estate businessman who lost his wife.Qin Yu had been extremely clever since young and even looked pleasantly good.She had excellent grades and outstanding talents. She never let the Lin family worry about her studies.No matter where she was, she was used as a role model.The Lin family were extremely satisfied with Qin Yu.Ning Qing was naturally happy to bring Qin Yu into the Lin family.But at the thought of bringing Qin Ran to the Lin family next.Ning Qing didn\u2019t even have an appetite for lunch.**At 4 PM, the black BMW stopped in front of the Lin family\u2019s villa in Yun Cheng.\u201cMadam.\u201d A middle-aged woman in a blue shirt opened the door. She was surprised when she saw Chen Shulan and Qin Ran behind Ning Qing.Ning Qing felt a little stuffy and was visibly upset. \u201cAunt Zhang, bring my mother and Ran Ran in first. Yu\u2019er will end her class soon, I\u2019ll pick her up.\u201dQin Yu had always been picked up by the Lin family\u2019s driver.Today Ning Qing went personally to pick her up because she was frustrated and didn\u2019t want to face Qin Ran at home. Thus, she went out to take a breath.Aunt Zhang watched as Ning Qing left. Then, she turned to look at the two with suspicion in her eyes.\u201cOld lady, Ms. Qin.\u201d She glanced them up and down with extremely cryptic eyes before she said, \u201cCome in.\u201dThen, she turned her head first and led the way. She pursed her lips at an angle where the two couldn\u2019t see.Chen Shulan walked along and saw exquisitely decorated European-style buildings.Her fingers clung to the corners of her clothes unconsciously.They stopped at the hall and Aunt Zhang was about to take out the slippers.But Chen Shulan walked in with her shoes.After Chen Shulan stepped in, she saw Aunt Zhang staring at her in surprise.Although she was from the countryside, she always loved cleanliness and didn\u2019t have much dust on her heels and clothes.Aunt Zhang\u2019s stare was burdensome, but her granddaughter was beside her, so Chen Shulan tried her best to ignore Aunt Zhang\u2019s stare and straightened her back.She took a step back and wanted to change her shoes, but Aunt Zhang shoved the slippers back inside.There were a lot of guest rooms in the Lin family\u2019s house. Aunt Zhang couldn\u2019t tell Ning Qing\u2019s current attitude and took the two of them to a room on the third floor.At the corner of the second floor, there was a half-opened door with a precious violin in the room.Qin Ran gave it a second glance.Aunt Zhang glanced at Qin Ran and said blankly, \u201cThis is the Second Lady\u2019s violin room.\u201dQin Ran raised her eyebrows and followed behind Aunt Zhang lazily. She thought casually that Qin Yu was very favored in the Lin family.The guest rooms upstairs were slightly dull.\u201cThis is the bathroom. You know how to use the water heater, right?\u201d Aunt Zhang opened the door of the bathroom and introduced it as if the two were cavemen.Qin Ran sat on the low table with one leg slightly bent. She fiddled with the flowers placed on the table with one hand, her sleeves rolled up.Revealing her bare white wrists.\u201cRest first. If you need anything, just call me. I\u2019ll head downstairs first.\u201d Aunt Zhang said a few more notes before heading down to the kitchen to help.After she left, Qin Ran locked the door.Chen Shulan looked at the beautiful spotless room and thought for a long time before smiling. \u201cThis Aunt Zhang looks pretty\u2026 easy to get along with. Next time\u2026 you and your mother, sigh.\u201dQin Ran dumped the contents of her backpack on the table.She raised her eyebrows but did not speak.Chen Shulan watched as Qin Ran played with her stuff and didn\u2019t disturb her. This granddaughter really had a lot of weird things.Last time, she had seen a chilling gun on the table and Chen Shulan had been really scared, but Qin Ran later told her that it was just a toy gun.Qin Ran sat on the table with her legs bent and fiddled with the contents of her backpack. She placed a laptop without a logo which looked quite new and didn\u2019t have a brand on the table carelessly.Then, she took out a very heavy mobile phone.She continued to throw it onto the table.She had always been messy and had to pick out a white plastic bottle from the pile of items.When it was picked up, it also made a shaking sound from the water inside.A messy Q was drawn with a black pen outside and a note was attached.Qin Ran tore off the sticky note and wrote a string of characters on it. She looked at it for a while and then tossed it aside.She only held the white plastic bottle in her hand. She tilted her head and looked at Chen Shulan, then tossed the bottle into the pile.After a while, Aunt Zhang came up and knocked on the door\u2014\u201cSir is back with Young Master. They\u2019re both downstairs and want to see you both.\u201d**Downstairs, Lin Qi was whispering to Lin Jinxuan.After all, she had to bring a daughter back again and Ning Qing didn\u2019t have the guts to make the decision. Thus, she had called Lin Qi when she was in the hospital.\u201cI heard that she left school for a year after making a serious mistake and is a big troublemaker. It\u2019s a bit unbearable for her to be brought in.\u201d Lin Qi thought about Ning Qing\u2019s request and frowned in worry.She had thought that since Qin Yu was so obedient, her sister couldn\u2019t be any worse, so he hadn\u2019t asked much.But trouble was under his nose. The Lin family never had such a troublemaker before.Lin Jinxuan frowned, put one hand on the sofa, tilted his head and pressed his phone as if he was talking to someone.He didn\u2019t even lift his head when Lin Qi was talking and was evidently very uninterested.But when he heard movement on the stairs, he raised his eyes inadvertently and glanced there.He was stunned.Liked it?

    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: This Is LordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosThe Lin family was a noble family and had been known for three generations in Yun Cheng.Lin Qi was less than fifty this year and did not have the stoutness that people his age usually had. His youthful style, gentleness, and elegance could still be vaguely seen. His eyes under the gold-rimmed glasses always inadvertently showed the sharpness that had been honed from his years of business experience.Even Qin Ran thought that Ning Qing was lucky to have married Lin Qi.Lin Qi squeezed a cigarette in his hand, thought for a while, and then put it down. \u201cXiao Qing has already told me about Ran Ran. Don\u2019t worry, I have already sent someone to arrange it.\u201dChen Shulan was from the countryside and was not much cultured. She felt helpless and panicky at being in such a noble family for the first time.Even if Lin Qi\u2019s attitude towards her was good, she still felt slightly uncomfortable.Lin Qi could feel it, so he smiled and accompanied Chen Shulan to drink tea. He occasionally made conversation to ease Chen Shulan\u2019s awkwardness and waited for Ning Qing to come back.Qin Ran leaned on the sofa and lazily pressed on her mobile phone while playing a game.Her fingers were slender and beautiful and appeared extremely white under the light from the floor-to-ceiling windows.Her eyebrows were low, and from the angle of Lin Jinxuan, he could see her long eyelashes fluttering slightly.She seemed to feel him peeping at her and slowly raised her head.She had clean and clear eyes, and there was no panic like Chen Shulan\u2019s in them.It was as peaceful as a cold lake, dark and deep.90% cold.The remaining 10% was her stubbornness and banditry in her bones that couldn\u2019t be covered up.Lin Jinxuan\u2019s hand that held the teacup paused for a moment. He didn\u2019t have the embarrassment of being caught in the act and just smiled distantly.Qin Ran looked away casually and changed her posture calmly. She continued to press on her phone.Lin Jinxuan, who had never been given the cold shoulder, was stunned once again.After a short while, he reacted and turned his brightly-lit screen off. Then, he leaned back and sneered.2He had a frivolous expression on his cultured and refined face.Sure enough, as per Lin Qi\u2019s description, she was a troublemaker.She was incredibly arrogant.Chen Shulan knew that Qin Ran loved to play and liked playing games when she was bored. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want to control Qin Ran, but every time she looked at her with her pair of beautiful apricot eyes, the bottom of her eyes would turn misty.Who could stand it?Chen Shulan would then forget about her anger.What else could she do?She could just get used to it.Not to mention playing games, even if she played truancy, Chen Shulan would still turn a blind eye to it.It was the first time she doted so much on a granddaughter at her age.But now, Qin Ran had already been expelled for a year, and Chen Shulan had also found out about her illness, so this time, she ruthlessly ignored Qin Ran and her coquetry. No matter what method she used, Chen Shulan made up her mind to send her to a school in Yun Cheng.Lin Qi, the patriarch of the Lin family, was right in front of her. Chen Shulan wanted Qin Ran to make a good impression on Lin Qi. She had reminded Qin Ran more than once to stop playing her games and to perform well in front of Lin Qi.She just\u2026 couldn\u2019t be fierce with her.Chen Shulan was worried. This was the Lord, who could cure her after she was gone?Everyone in the room had their own thoughts and didn\u2019t talk much until Ning Qing returned with Qin Yu. The atmosphere suddenly eased.Lin Qi looked at Qin Yu, who was following behind Ning Qing obediently, and smiled warmly.Aunt Zhang, who had always been cold to Qin Ran and Chen Shulan, greeted them immediately and took Qin Yu\u2019s school bag from her hands. She said respectfully, \u201cMadam. Miss.\u201dEveryone on the sofa, including Lin Qi, all stood up.Under Chen Shulan\u2019s stare, Qin Ran stood up lazily. She leaned against the sofa and stared coldly at Qin Yu and Ning Qing.She was cold and proud.She gave them a glance before lowering her head to look at her phone. She wasn\u2019t playing games anymore and seemed to be chatting with someone.Qin Ran\u2019s resume was already incredibly inferior amongst ordinary people, let alone in front of the outstanding Lin Jinxuan.At the thought of this, Ning Qing felt a little irritable.How could Ning Qing have the face to talk about Qin Ran in front of the Lin family\u2019s heir, Lin Jinxuan?Wouldn\u2019t it be a joke to mention it?Thus, she kept talking to Chen Shulan and Lin Qi without mentioning Qin Ran.\u201cYu\u2019er was rehearsing for First Middle School\u2019s celebration, so she came back late.\u201d At the mention of Qin Yu, Ning Qing was flushed with excitement.\u201cViolin performance?\u201d Chen Shulan also felt it was a rarity and looked at Qin Yu in surprise.Aunt Zhang brought two cups of tea over and smiled at Chen Shulan\u2019s words. \u201cMiss has been learning violin since young. After passing the ninth grade, the school always invites her to perform whenever there\u2019s an event.\u201dThis sentence made Ning Qing proud and satisfied. This was the daughter she had spent countless efforts cultivating.Chen Shulan was also very pleased, but she felt a little uncomfortable at Aunt Zhang\u2019s purposeful tone.The smile on her face faded a little.After Qin Yu returned, she walked directly to Lin Jinxuan. She held his arm and smiled at him. \u201cBrother, why are you back?\u201d\u201cI have a project.\u201d Lin Jinxuan narrowed his eyes and said in a rare tone.After all, she was the only girl in the Lin family. So, Qin Yu was heavily favored and Lin Jinxuan also doted on her.While talking, he glanced at Qin Ran, who had one hand in her pocket and the other holding her mobile phone while leaning casually against the sofa. Her eyes were lowered and her expression wasn\u2019t clear.Qin Yu saw Lin Jinxuan\u2019s strange expression and tilted her head subconsciously.On the way back, Ning Qing had already informed her beforehand, so Qin Yu naturally knew that Qin Ran was here.She stared at Qin Ran for a moment, then glanced back very lightly.1The Nanny set the dinner quickly.While eating, Lin Qi glanced at Qin Ran. After thinking for a while, he said, \u201cLet her go to First Middle School. She and Yu\u2019er can take care of each other.\u201dHis tone was calm.After Lin Qi said this, the atmosphere at the dinner table changed.Qin Yu paused when she heard Lin Qi\u2019s words.She glanced at Qin Ran and looked indifferent. \u201cFirst Middle School? Same level as me?\u201dQin Ran was one year older than Qin Yu.Even Aunt Zhang, who stood at the side, also glanced mockingly at Qin Ran.Then, she quickly lowered her head.Tsk, she had thought Qin Ran was here to attend college.Ning Qing\u2019s face was a bit stiff. She had never felt so shameful after coming to the Lin family for so many years.Beside her, Lin Qi\u2019s expression was the same. He said in a mild tone, \u201cYour sister has to repeat her third year due to some matters.\u201dHer results couldn\u2019t possibly be good if she had to repeat her third year.\u201cI see.\u201dQin Yu smiled and said, \u201cOh.\u201dThen, she nodded and stayed silent.All of the Lin family knew that Qin Yu had long occupied one of the top five positions in her grade.Ning Qing finally reacted. She had intended for Qin Ran to be put into a private school and hadn\u2019t expected Lin Qi to let Qin Ran go to First Middle School.Everyone knew that First Middle School was the best school in Yun Cheng.To put a person like Qin Ran with such a dark history and bad results into First Middle School, Lin Qi had to spend a lot of time and even had to owe the principal a favor.First Middle School only had top students. A student like Qin Ran would be unusual.\u201cBut it isn\u2019t easy to get into First Middle School.\u201d Ning Qing knew this. She felt depressed and immediately lost her appetite.She paused and thought of something. \u201cRan Ran, I remember you were enrolled in a violin class when you were young? What level are you in now?\u201d1First Middle School had art classes.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was absent-minded and didn\u2019t even look up.1Ning Qing was about to flare up when Lin Qi glanced over.She suppressed her anger and repeated her words with a cold face.1Qin Ran\u2019s sitting posture was really unruly. She raised her legs, held her chopsticks in one hand, and propped her arm on the table.She looked like a gangster, proud and mad.3As if she only heard the voice now, Qin Ran looked up.At the mention of Qin Ran having learned violin before, Lin Jinxuan also looked up at her.He heard Qin Ran say, \u201cViolin?\u201dShe held her chin in her hands and suddenly smiled. Her voice was dull and cold. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know how to play.\u201d1\u201cYou don\u2019t? How could it be? You started learning it when you were young.\u201d Ning Qing pinched the chopsticks in her hands and gritted her teeth. \u201cI give you a sum of money to learn the violin every year. Teacher Xu even said you had good talent\u2026\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Qin Ran fiddled with the rib slowly. \u201cEver since I hit Teacher Xu\u2019s son\u2019s head, we\u2019ve never met.\u201d5There was a strange silence on the dining table.Qin Ran laughed a cold, bad laugh.2Her slightly raised delicate eyebrows had the arrogance of youths. On closer inspection, there seemed to be a bit of ruthlessness.In Ning Qing\u2019s words, she was a \u201cbandit\u201d. Both a bandit and wild, seemingly gorgeous and alluring, but untouchable.What immortal and triggering expression was this?And her tone as well?Ning Qing glanced at her, her eyes flushed slightly. \u201cQin Ran?!\u201dYi Zhong had art classes. Ning Qing remembered that Qin Ran had learned the violin when she was young. Since her studies were bad, she could just change her path and walk on the path of the arts.She didn\u2019t expect Qin Ran to take the initiative to give her such a big \u201csurprise\u201d.Lin Qi had seen Qin Ran\u2019s information in the afternoon. He knew she was a troublemaker, but didn\u2019t expect her to be so full of thorns.1Aunt Zhang brought a cup of tea for Ning Qing. Ning Qing sighed, drank it, and stopped mentioning the matter, but her tight back showed that she wasn\u2019t in a good mood.Lin Qi was busy with his business and naturally didn\u2019t have the spare time to spend around Chen Shulan and Qin Ran.Or maybe he thought it wasn\u2019t necessary.After dinner, they all dispersed.When Qin Yu saw Lin Jinxuan go out to pick up a phone call, she obediently told Ning Qing she was going upstairs to play the violin.Ning Qing looked at her younger daughter and her older daughter. Both of them were obviously her children, but how could the difference between them be so big?4\u201cGo stay with your grandmother temporarily on the third floor. I\u2019ll let Aunt Zhang clean up another room for you later.\u201d Ning Qing frowned and tilted her head slightly. She suppressed the anger in her heart and lowered her voice. \u201cOther than the bathroom, the second floor has your sister\u2019s piano room. Don\u2019t bother her over nothing.\u201d1As soon as Qin Yu left, the tenderness on her face faded.Qin Ran leaned on the staircase and nodded, her expression indifferent.Since Qin Ran\u2019s attitude was fairly obedient, Ning Qing\u2019s sullen expression finally eased. After all, she was her own daughter and she still had feelings for her.6Ning Qing said a few things to Chen Shulan before turning around to see that Qin Ran had her mobile phone out again. She frowned and was about to nag at her.But it just so happened that the piano room on the second floor wasn\u2019t closed fully, and the melodious and gentle violin sound floated out.Ning Qing was relieved and said to Aunt Zhang, \u201cIt seems that Yu\u2019er will enter tenth grade soon. Ran Ran! Learn from your sister more, there should be a beginning and an end to everything.\u201d3Her words turned towards Qin Ran again.Qin Ran glanced at the second floor with raised eyelids. Her pair of apricot eyes were a little bad, but they were extremely beautiful and still resembled a bandit.She turned and went upstairs, her legs long and straight.She ignored Ning Qing.Yes, she was very impressive.Ning Qing pointed at her back with a flushed face. She thought about just how Qin Ran had slammed a brick again and again on her head\u20262Chen Shulan frowned, but was reluctant to fault Qin Ran, so she could only calm Ning Qing down.**Upstairs, the nanny had already taken Chen Shulan\u2019s things to the next room.Qin Ran took a bath and, before her hair was completely dry, she tied the straps of her bathrobe while reaching out for the new-looking computer from her backpack.Next to the computer was a heavy mobile phone which looked different from the mobile phone she usually played games with.1She didn\u2019t look at the phone, just pressed her towel on her head and placed the computer on the table. As soon as she opened the computer, the desktop screen appeared in seconds.The computer desktop was very clean. Except for the desert background, there was only a white mouse arrow and no other icon could be seen.It was a very warm yet oppressive desert color.Qin Ran reached out and pressed a few keys, then got up and poured a glass of water. She sat on the chair with the glass of water and a face appeared on the computer screen.The other party was wearing a white shirt, holding a cell phone in one hand and a medicine box in the other.With a white shirt on, long eyelashes and fair skin, his face could be described as beautiful.\u201cSomeone is investigating you.\u201d Qin Ran leaned on the back of the chair and took a sip of water. \u201cSomeone from Beijing. I\u2019ve sent you the information about the other party.\u201dAt the age of six, Qin Ran already knew that she was different from the others after finishing her elementary school course.1She couldn\u2019t play with her peers and would even occasionally go crazy.Her neighbors all thought she was crazy and avoided her.Ning Qing and Qin Hanqiu only focused on quarreling every day and didn\u2019t pay much attention to her situation. They only knew that she loved to fight, had a mental problem, and didn\u2019t want to go to school.1When they divorced, they were both unwilling to take her along.Qin Ran taught herself high school content at the age of eight.5At the age of nine, she assembled the first computer in her life and used her own code to conquer a hacker website.4In the video, the man squinted his pair of demon eyes. His nose was very high and he looked extremely handsome. Even in a foreign country, people wouldn\u2019t be able to resist turning back to look at him again.2Gu Xichi, a doctor who traveled all over the country, had excellent medical skills and a strange temper. He traveled around the world to treat the poor.2This time, there was a terrorist attack in the Middle East, so he immediately carried his medical kit there to save the world.Qin Ran only knew that he was a doctor, Gu Xichi.Gu Xichi also only knew that she was a hacker, Qin Ran.The two had a fatal relationship but never asked about each other.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Gu Xichi bit the cigarette in his mouth, took out another phone and checked the e-mail Qin Ran had sent him. He said vaguely, \u201cLittle friend, don\u2019t care about this matter. I\u2019ll find someone to solve it.\u201d1Gu Xichi finished reading the information and calmly put his phone back in his pocket.\u201cThe other party has a reason?\u201d Qin Ran put her cup on the table.Gu Xichi nodded casually.Qin Ran grabbed the towel she had thrown to one side and laid her legs on the table on the other side. Her movements were light and yet slow, and extremely wild.She continued brushing her hair and said in a slow voice, \u201cWhatever.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be disappointed. When you\u2019re all grown up and as good as the hacker Q who has been circulating on the Internet recently, I will show you the outside world.\u201d Gu Xichi casually reassured her.1Liked it?

The embassy communicated with foreign ministries, but the investigation did not come to fruition as it concerned military satellites.1It caused an uproar locally, as tons of people took to the internet to voice their unhappiness.Just as the embassy members were out of ideas, a hacker appeared out of nowhere and disabled the military satellite system of that country.Not much was known about the hacker, except that the person used the code name \u201cQ\u201d.3An ordinary hacker who had never been known in this field had suddenly become as famous and popular as the top five hackers.And he was now being eyed on by the international police.1From then on, the code name Q practically became synonymous with mysteriousness and was hailed as the father of contemporary hacking.Because of that, the requirement for enrolment into the computing course was raised drastically.1There were too many different versions about the story of Q, but no one was truly able to find any clues about this person.Qin Ran did not look up. There were no outsiders around and her legs were casually propped up. In the light, her hands holding the towel were so pale. \u201cHung up.\u201d\u201cSo early?\u201d Gu Xichi smiled and thanked the passerby who guided him. His eyes returned to the phone screen and he paused for a moment. Just as Qin Ran was about to click on the link, he said, \u201cRan\u2019er, you\u2019re in a dangerous situation right now.\u201d1**It was night.The lights in the school doctor\u2019s office were dim and soft.The girl rested her cheek against her left hand as she sat opposite the doctor.\u201cThe painkiller can only alleviate your toothache, you\u2019ll still have to go to the main hospital tomorrow,\u201d the young person said as he wrote on a medical certificate. \u201cHand this over to your teacher and ask for a leave of absence tomorrow.\u201d1The light reflected off the ear stud was bright and cold.The young person looked simple but pleasant, and his hair had some silver highlights.\u201cThank you.\u201d The girl gave him a grateful nod as she scanned her school card but still looked a little weary because of the ache.The young person waved his hand kindly and looked towards the back. \u201cGrandpa Juan.\u201dAs the girl turned around, she caught the corner of the couch in her peripheral vision.A hand was resting on the side of the couch\u2014the fingers were draping downwards naturally, the joint segments pronounced and slender.A very artistic hand.2The young person touched his ear stud and quietly said, \u201cIt\u2019s already eight.\u201d\u201cThe task is tough this time?\u201dCheng Juan was up to something and hadn\u2019t slept in days. He gave a tired acknowledgment. \u201cWent to look for Jiang Dongye.\u201d1He did not explain further. His movements had always been kept rather secretive, even Old Master Cheng wasn\u2019t too sure what he was onto.He got up with the support of that hand on the couch.It was a black top with the sleeves rolled up a few rounds, revealing some of his wrists.The tips of his eyes were a little cold and distant. His eyes were too beautiful, they charmed others even when he wasn\u2019t smiling.Just like the rose at dawn.A while later, he casually said, \u201cGo home.\u201dThe young man quickly walked before him and stood there respectfully.Grandpa Juan of the Cheng family, the devil\u2019s incarnate of the city.At 16, he started up a firm and handed it to his older sister a while later. The enterprise was now one of the top five firms in the country.At 17, he was suddenly inspired to research on robots with a group of like-minded people, and these robots were now exhibited internationally.At 18, he tried out being a police officer.\u2026At 21, he became a surgeon at the hospital.5And this surgeon was different from the rest. He only took up one operation a month, and still, the quota often went unfulfilled.4There was no other reason except that his hands were hailed the \u201cHands of God\u201d.He refused to stay on in that place too and ended up in an ordinary school as a school doctor. And he was different from the rest yet again\u2014he brought an assistant.1The assistant did his daily work for him.He was the descendant of a wealthy and powerful family, but he never joined the military, partook in politics, got involved in business\u2026 he never even attended classes in overseas universities in which he was technically enrolled.He was so different, so unambitious, unlike the other descendants of his family.Grandpa Juan was one of a kind, and no one dared mention him.1As he was the son of Old Master Cheng, and Old Master doted on him so very much.4Not many in the city, or even in the family, knew why Old Master, who had been so strict his whole life, could dote on this son who had no ambition to better himself.\u201cClick\u2014\u201dThe school doctor\u2019s office was locked.The girl was stunned with the medicine in her hands.A short moment later when the figure had disappeared, she finally snapped back and held onto her aching cheek.It hurt!**The next morning.Qin Ran went downstairs for her breakfast in low spirits.She was slightly red under her eyes, possibly a sign of poor sleep quality or a lack of sleep.\u201cAssistant Chen will take you to First Middle School later.\u201d Ning Qing put her chopsticks down as she looked up. \u201cI\u2019m taking your grandma to the specialist later.\u201dWhen Qin Yu first went to school, Ning Qing had personally sent her there. But she wasn\u2019t doing the same with this one.3Ning Qing clenched her jaw as she thought about having to deal with the gloating Lin family relatives.It was all Qin Ran\u2019s fault for being so disappointing. If only she was just one-tenth as good as Qin Yu.8Lin Qi had newspapers in one hand and his cellphone in another as he walked towards them from the living room.Ning Qing asked what the matter was.Lin Qi didn\u2019t look too pleased. \u201cIt\u2019s about Ran Ran.\u201d He looked towards Qin Ran apologetically. \u201cUncle apologizes, Director Ding just gave a reply and said you probably won\u2019t be able to get into First Middle School.\u201dNing Qing\u2019s fingers tensed up. Lin Qi\u2019s words made her feel embarrassed.1Qin Yu finished her milk and carried the bag that Aunt Zhang handed to her. When she got up, she looked at Lin Qi with her head tilted in confusion. \u201cDad, it\u2019s not hard to get into First Middle School, why can\u2019t Sis get in?\u201d1She looked pretty and adorable as she asked innocently.4Ning Qing\u2019s fingers shook as the housemaids around her shot her weird glances. She felt humiliated.4\u201cGo to school first, you\u2019re about to be late.\u201d Lin Qi looked towards Qin Yu a little helplessly.He then turned towards Qin Ran. \u201cUncle is at fault. The teachers at Wen De Middle School aren\u2019t any worse than First Middle School\u2019s, right, Yu\u2019er?\u201d1Qin Yu let out a little laugh as she nodded and got ready to leave.Qin Ran was still in a rather foul morning mood, but thankfully, she wasn\u2019t hot-tempered.She kept her head low as she chewed on her dough stick, her lashes concealing her pretty eyes.\u201cWell, I shouldn\u2019t trouble Uncle any further.\u201d She seemed to be stifling some emotions and yet spoke with a casual, loafing tone. \u201cI have the recommendation letter from the principal of First Middle School.\u201d2Liked it?

Her grades were the worst in the school, she\u2019d gotten into fights countless times, and the gap year she took was out of no valid reason.First Middle School was very particular about the promotion rate of their students. Qin Ran\u2019s study history was simply too horrible, Director Ding couldn\u2019t bring himself to accept her.1He knew that Qin Ran wasn\u2019t the most favorable choice, but didn\u2019t expect her to fall short by this much that Director Ding wouldn\u2019t take her in.He thought about finding a private school instead.But things were getting odd now.Qin Yu stifled laughter as she turned to Qin Ran. \u201cYou said\u2026 you have a recommendation letter from our Principal?\u201d1First Middle School had been a renowned elite school for the longest time. Anyone who could work his way up to become the principal was certainly somebody with a powerful background.Even Lin Qi had only looked for Director Ding.Qin Ran\u2019s background was no secret. How could a girl like her with no social network or achievements be able to get in touch with the principal of First Middle School?\u201cYes.\u201d Qin Ran looked up and responded succinctly.She leaned backward, reached into the bag hanging off her seat and felt for the white envelope.\u201cEnough!\u201d Ning Qing slammed the table and yelled, \u201cWho taught you to lie? Don\u2019t you find yourself an embarrassment?!\u201d1She\u2019d subjected herself to shame by asking Lin Qi for help regarding Qin Ran\u2019s matters, not expecting her daughter to go overboard.She was still worthless and nothing had changed indeed.\u201cMom, watch your health.\u201d Qin Yu turned around and patted her mother on the back. She hesitated before saying, \u201cMaybe Sis really has our principal\u2019s\u2026\u201dNing Qing scoffed. \u201cShe\u2019s done so many ridiculous things before, don\u2019t you speak up for her!\u201dNing Qing never got over the fact that Qin Hanqiu had threatened her to take Qin Ran along back then.1Lin Jinxuan came back and sensed the odd atmosphere. He smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dQin Yu went to Lin Jinxuan and briefly told him about it.It was a pretty absurd matter.Qin Ran finished her porridge, held the letter in her hand and carried her bag. She got up. \u201cI\u2019m going to school.\u201dShe was in a loose-fitting, plain white t-shirt.And she walked out of the house without a rush.She practically didn\u2019t give a hoot about what had just happened at home.Ning Qing was left fuming.\u201cWhere\u2019s Sis going?\u201d Qin Yu said, \u201cActually, she just has to admit her fault, it\u2019s no big\u2014\u201dLin Jinxuan suddenly said, \u201cShe\u2019s not lying.\u201dLin Qi, Qin Yu and the rest did not quite understand him.Lin Jinxuan recalled the seal on the envelope as he rubbed his temple. \u201cThat was Principal Xu\u2019s personal seal. I\u2019ve seen it before when I was in the Student Union.\u201d1Everyone went silent.Lin Qi had not said a thing, but he was stunned as well.1Ning Qing was in shock as she tried to process what he was saying.Before she fully calmed down, Lin Qi asked, \u201cRan Ran knows the principal of First Middle School?\u201d1Qin Yu grabbed her bag and mumbled something under her breath, before heading out the door for school. Her expression was unreadable.**At First Middle School.In the Principal\u2019s office.A bespectacled elderly man was sitting at his desk. His clothes were neat and tidy, and behind those glasses were the eyes of a deep man.A woman and a slightly older man entered the office. The woman politely greeted. \u201cPrincipal Xu.\u201dHer brows were messy, her eyes dull, and her slips curving downwards at the tips. She looked pretty unpleasant and was evidently a curt woman.2This was the teacher-in-charge of Class 3.1, Li Airong. She was the only female teacher-in-charge in the whole of First Middle School.Principal Xu put his pen down and looked at the girl sitting in the corner with her leg propped up rudely. \u201cTeacher Li, this student over here, I\u2019d like her to join your class.\u201d1Principal Xu put it very succinctly.It was rare to see students join the school only in Year 3.Li Airong received the two sets of information and narrowed her eyes when she saw the previous result slips.\u201cShe\u2019s going to be a full-time student here? And her grades are going to be entered into the school system?\u201d Li Airong was firmly against it. \u201cYou\u2019re just tossing crap into my class, she\u2019ll ruin the entire class atmosphere. Principal, you\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d1\u201cTeacher Li, there\u2019s a student present here, watch your words.\u201d The middle-aged man beside her frowned.The man was slightly plump and had small eyes. He always seemed to have a smile on his face.This was the teacher-in-charge of Class 3.9, Gao Yang.Gao Yang figured out that the girl sitting in the corner was probably the student they were discussing.It wasn\u2019t nice to be called \u201ccrap\u201d so openly.1\u201cTeacher Gao, you\u2019re in charge of a mainstream class, of course it\u2019s easy for you to talk. What if we put her in your class instead, would you be this calm? If you\u2019ve got spare time on your hands, you\u2019re better off thinking about how to improve your students\u2019 grades.\u201dThe class she took was the special stream, they were all the top hundred students in the school.Li Airong wanted to be awarded as one of the \u201c10 Most Outstanding Teachers in the Province\u201d, and there was only one slot for their city. If she had to take in a student that would potentially pull her class down, it\u2019d lower her chances.1\u201cIf this was my student, I\u2019d definitely be responsible for her.\u201d Gao Yang had always been disapproving of the way she treated students differently based on their aptitudes.2Principal Xu remained silent in his seat.He simply glanced at the girl in the corner, as if sounding her out.Qin Ran looked up at him expressionlessly.She looked so unfazed by everything and was practically unreadable if one could not detect the hint of rebellion and stubbornness.Principal Xu looked away.He propped his glasses up and gestured for Li Airong to hand the documents to Gao Yang. \u201cTeacher Gao, would you be willing to take this student?\u201dGao Yang skimmed through her history and felt a spark inside him.He wanted to save this lost girl!4Seeing that Gao Yang agreed to it, Li Airong heaved a huge sigh of relief.Qin Ran carried her bag and followed behind Gao Yang, a slender figure shadowing the slightly plump man. When he asked her a question, she acknowledged briefly.Her tone was calm and unbothered.What an obedient and pleasant-looking student! Gao Yang thought to himself.4Li Airong walked in front of the two of them, her heels clicking away. She did not look at Qin Ran, but rather, swept a glance at Gao Yang and sarcastically said, \u201cNo wonder Teacher Gao hasn\u2019t been making much progress even after 20 years in this career.\u201dTo that, Gao Yang simply smiled at Qin Ran. \u201cQin Ran, don\u2019t give up. There\u2019s one more year, everything is possible.\u201dQin Ran nodded.\u201cPfft\u2014\u201d Li Airong side-eyed Qin Ran, barely concealing her disdain.1Gao Yang must\u2019ve gone mad.With that, she strutted off.\u201cTeacher Li is like this all the time, she teaches our class English\u2026\u201d Gao Yang furrowed his brows and tried to ignore Li Airong as he took Qin Ran to get her uniform and books.Qin Ran asked him where the school doctor\u2019s office was.The two of them conversed as they walked.Gao Yang was genuinely worried; her grades were simply too poor, he had no idea how to start helping her.\u201cTeacher Gao, please wait.\u201d Principal Xu\u2019s voice could be heard from the back. \u201cI have an exam script here, please have it marked.\u201d1Liked it?

An insignificant desolation seemed to linger between his fingertips.\u201cLook at it.\u201d Principal Xu passed the paper to Gao Yang.The paper rolls were neatly folded and somewhat old.After being opened, there were slight uneven wrinkles on the rolled surface, as if it had been rubbed into a ball before.Gao Yang looked at the paper and was very surprised.This was last year\u2019s International Olympics test paper. Gao Yang had taken the Mathematical Olympiad class last year and had done a lot of questions. He had referred to the answers three times before he figured out this test paper.1At first glance, he saw the words, their postures vertical and leaning on each other. The ink changed in thickness freely and the words were an unrestrained vigor of strokes.2It was a form of willfulness and lack of restraint from the inside out.Even across a paper, Gao Yang could almost see how the person who had written the paper held the pen. That person was cool and wild with an unrestrained madness, smiling at him remotely.The Mathematical Olympiad was a question from last year\u2019s International Mathematical Olympiad and was not available online.Gao Yang had studied this set of papers last year and hence, he scanned through it quickly. A large part of the problem-solving answers was different from the solutions he had read before, but the general direction was right.There were not many questions on the paper, but Gao Yang looked at it for a long time.\u201cI don\u2019t know much about the Olympiad, so I want you to help me look at how that kid is doing.\u201d Principal Xu poured a cup of tea for Gao Yang and passed it to him.Gao Yang took the cup and didn\u2019t drink it immediately. He just held the paper and looked at it for a long time.\u201cPrincipal Xu, who did this? A student in our school?\u201dPrincipal Xu did not answer. He took the teacup and asked softly, sighing, \u201cWas it done well?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more than good,\u201d Gao Yang said, with a regretful tone tinged with curiosity. \u201cIf I had seen this student two years earlier, the gold medal would have been ours.\u201dPrincipal Xu smiled and did not answer.Gao Yang could not help but ask again, \u201cIs this person from our school?\u201dThe best students in math were Xu Yaoguang from their class and Lin Jinxuan, who had graduated earlier. However, they couldn\u2019t even compare to the person who did this paper.If this person was in their school, they would be able to hit a new high.But it didn\u2019t seem possible, as he couldn\u2019t have not known about it.1**School medical office.A very simple pure gray door frame was half-opened.Not far away, a group of girls in physical education class frolicked with each other and looked at the school medical office.There seemed to be some treasure there.Lu Zhaoying touched the shining studs on his left ear. He smiled and dismissed the 23rd girl this morning before smirking at Cheng Juan, who was lying on the sofa. \u201cYour market price is just as in the past\u2026\u201d1Cheng Juan pulled the blanket over his face.\u201cShut up, don\u2019t make noise.\u201dLu Zhaoying mimicked a zip over his mouth.He looked up. \u201cThis girl looks good!\u201dLu Zhaoying quickly changed his position and made a pose.He held his black gel pen, said hello lazily, before saying rudely, \u201cLittle sister, where are you uncomfortable?\u201d1Qin Ran looked over him at the medicine in the cupboard. \u201cIs there a sleeping pill?\u201dHer voice was neither cold nor warm.\u201cSleeping pill?\u201d There had been many girls who had asked for medicine just to see Cheng Juan, and she was the first one to come here sincerely for medicine.1Lu Zhaoying felt that it was very rare. \u201cThe sleeping pills are prescription drugs, I can\u2019t give them to you\u2026\u201dA sudden low voice interrupted him. \u201cHow many?\u201dLu Zhaoying turned his head suddenly.Cheng Juan\u2019s long, clean fingers stopped on the box containing sleeping pills and looked up at Qin Ran.\u201cTen tablets.\u201d She looked at the box of pills.Cheng Juan nodded. He counted ten pills, wrapped it in white paper, and handed it to Qin Ran.Qin Ran took it.He didn\u2019t expect the transaction to be so smooth, so she held the medicine, paused, and looked at Cheng Juan again. \u201cThank you.\u201d2She slowly put the medicine away. Her face was so beautiful but there was no expression, and her delicate eyebrows couldn\u2019t conceal her perverse personality.Her eyes were a little bloodshot and were clearly not so purely white. It was hazy but still looked a little wild and fierce.She was wearing a pure white T-shirt and her collarbone was revealed near the collar. Her skin was dazzling white and her pale cyan blood vessels could be seen.Cheng Juan looked at her sideways and suddenly smiled.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Prescription drugs need to be signed,\u201d he said.He pushed a list over.Qin Ran held a pen with her left hand and signed on it.Cheng Juan looked down at the written name\u2014Qin Ran.When she left, Lu Zhaoying asked, \u201cDo you know her?\u201dCheng Juan narrowed his eyes slightly and smirked. \u201cThin waist.\u201d6\u201cHuh?\u201dCheng Juan stopped talking.\u201cIs there something on?\u201d Lu Zhaoying stroked his chin and smiled wretchedly.Cheng Juan looked at the ugly handwriting on the medical record and said lightly, \u201cI\u2019m a doctor in the school. This is my duty.\u201dLu Zhaoying: \u201c\u2026\u201d You only remember now that you are the doctor here?1A group of girls pushed the light gray gate open.Lu Zhaoying looked at Cheng Juan.Cheng Juan turned back.Then, he said three casual words, \u201cDon\u2019t make noise.\u201dLu Zhaoying: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe looked in the direction where Qin Ran was leaving. Other than being especially pretty, he couldn\u2019t see anything special in her, and her handwriting was so ugly it was a little cute.6Master Juan couldn\u2019t possibly throw away all the noble ladies chasing after him in the city and fancy that girl, could he?2**In class 3.9, the fishes and dragons were mixed together.In the last row.A juvenile leaned on the table and whispered, \u201cYoung Master Xu, I\u2019ve inquired around. The Campus Belle Qin was unhappy in the morning because of her sister. Who on earth is Uncle Lin thinking? How could he put her in First Middle School and make Campus Belle awkward?\u201d He rubbed his chin and said, \u201cI heard that she took a year off school for fighting. Just how bad is she?\u201dThere were also female school bullies in First Middle School, and most of them had very fierce images. Compared with the beauty of normal aesthetic girls, the difference was great.The juvenile chuckled. \u201cIt seems like she just came to Yun Cheng and wants to enter First Middle School because of Campus Belle Qin.\u201dXu Yaoguang took out his notebook and threw it on the table with a slam. He said lightly, \u201cA painting of a tiger turned out to be a dog.\u201dThe school bell had not yet sounded.Gao Yang came to the class with the lesson plan in advance and was beaming with joy. \u201cToday, we have a new member joining us in class 3.9.

Is it a girl or a boy?\u201d Qiao Sheng\u2019s deskmate came over and asked, full of interest.At the beginning of the senior year, the teachers of each subject were strict on them and they only had a few interesting things happen.Upon hearing this, a bunch of people in the back row came up to them.\u201cIt\u2019s a girl, but don\u2019t anticipate her.\u201d Qiao Sheng rested his hands on the table and grinned.He didn\u2019t mention that this new classmate was Qin Yu\u2019s sister. Qin Yu was a person who was drawn to their circle by Xu Yaoguang, and it was no secret that Young Master Xu fancied her.\u201cWhy?\u201d At the mention that it was a girl, everyone grew excited.\u201cShe is repeating a year and is from Ninghai Village.\u201d Qiao Sheng shook his head. \u201cYou know, Ninghai Village is one of the three major poverty alleviation places in the province.\u201d1After hearing this, the minds of a group of teenagers suddenly paused.Immediately in their minds came the appearance of those frail, yellow-skinned children that they had seen in the news.There was no expectation for the new classmate.\u201cDarn you, Qiao Sheng, why are you like this? You\u2019re not giving room for my imagination.\u201d A teenager next to him spread his long legs out.Gao Yang was about to say something, but he saw that Qin Ran was still not inside, so he tilted his head and said with a gentle expression, \u201cQin Ran, come in quickly.\u201dQin Ran was still outside the classroom, holding a set of school uniforms and a few books.She held the book with one hand, and the school uniform was on the book.She held her phone in her other hand and looked at it.It was news of Gu Xichi. Qin Ran took one glance at it before arbitrarily shoving her phone back into her pocket. When she heard Gao Yang\u2019s voice, she took the book and school uniform and walked into the classroom.Qiao Sheng lowered his voice and said while spinning a pen, \u201cYoung Master Xu, do you think she got scared? I searched and found out that Ninghai\u2019s education isn\u2019t good. She\u2019s really damn brave to come to First Middle School.\u201dXu Yaoguang looked down at his phone, then he pulled his chair and stood up. \u201cI\u2019m going to the auditorium for Qin Yu\u2019s violin lesson.\u201dXu Yaoguang first saw Qin Yu because of her violin performance at the opening ceremony. Qin Yu had attracted him with her beautiful violin melody.Xu Yaoguang went out through the back door.He just happened to walk past Qin Ran.\u201cTsk, I\u2019m so jealous of him,\u201d Qiao Sheng said. He wasn\u2019t as bold as Young Master Xu and said in a depressed tone, \u201cI also want to see Campus Belle Qin play the violin. What\u2019s there to see about a new student.\u201dHe kicked his legs at his deskmate\u2019s table, hoping to find an accompaniment in complaining.But his deskmate didn\u2019t speak, and the classroom fell into a weird silence. All the whispers disappeared instantly.They were all staring at the podium, the silent classroom marking their astonishment.\u201cI\u2019m Qin Ran.\u201d Qin Ran switched her hand and held her book with her right hand. She used her left hand to write down her name on the blackboard with a chalk.She was obviously very polite.She even had a sort of disagreeableness in her that was carefully hidden.But her careless and casual movements clearly and yet undistinctly brought a sort of wildness.1No one in Class 3.9 spoke.It was very quiet.Gao Yang pointed to a vacant seat and smiled. \u201cYou can sit there. Lin Siran, introduce the campus to the new classmate after class.\u201dThe girl with a ponytail regained her senses. She blushed, then stood up and let Qin Ran walk to her seat.1Qiao Sheng and a few boys in the back row had not anticipated this new student, but they had probably already sketched out her image in their hearts.According to the news, those who had their face to the ground and their back to the sky must have bad skin, rough and dull. Furthermore, their temperament and grace definitely couldn\u2019t be compared to Qin Yu.2But now all these imaginations of theirs had been overturned.After Class 3.9 was quiet for two minutes, there was a loud inhalation.1The words on the blackboard were written in a single stroke. They were crooked and not rigid. Although they were not good-looking, they were full of personality.Just like her.She had long hair that fell over her shoulders, her skin was extremely white, and her legs were long and straight. Her apricot eyes were looked down, black and bright.She was full of free-spiritedness.And she was even icy-cold.Everyone in the classroom was watching her.1Her delicate eyebrows gathered a bit of evil between her eyes, the corners of her mouth were arched casually. She was definitely an impressive sister.Her aura was strong, and wherever she went, all the boys retracted their feet that had been stretched to the middle of the aisle.1\u201cDamn! This girl is wild and terribly pretty. Qiao Sheng, your news was wrong!\u201d\u201cWhat a hot deal, the campus belle is going to be changed!\u201d1\u201c\u2026\u201dLin Siran wanted to talk to the new classmate and take her on a walk around the campus, but she was already sitting on the table with one hand propped up, looking away.She was ostentatiously unbridled.She had such a big boss aura that Lin Siran didn\u2019t dare say a single word.After one lesson, Qin Ran put her school uniform on and asked Gao Yang for an accommodation form. She also asked for leave.2**Forty minutes later, inside the Lin family\u2019s house.\u201cWhy is Ms. Qin back again? School isn\u2019t finished yet, is it?\u201d Aunt Zhang opened the door and frowned when she saw her. Her gaze was harsh and judgemental.Qin Ran raised her eyebrows and said concisely, \u201cGet out.\u201dHer eyes were not purely black and white, but were also slightly bloodshot. Her originally cold eyes shot up with fierceness.Aunt Zhang\u2019s heart tightened, and she stepped back subconsciously.Qin Ran went straight upstairs.Aunt Zhang finally reacted and pursed her lips.If it weren\u2019t for Qin Yu, would Mr. Lin have agreed to bring her to the Lin family? She really thought she was all that?Upstairs, Qin Ran found Ning Qing\u2019s door.The door was half-open, and the sounds inside could be heard.Qin Ran\u2019s footsteps paused.It was Ning Qing\u2019s voice, aggrieved and irritable. \u201cYou\u2019re calling me biased, but what can I do? After a few days when the little aunts from the Lin family come over, how am I supposed to explain to them when they ask?\u201dChen Shulan was very ill and very weak. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you want me to tell them that Qin Ran dropped out of her school due to her rebellion and has come to Yun Cheng to repeat a year?\u201d Ning Qing said, almost resentful. \u201cSay that she\u2019s still in the senior year even though she\u2019s nineteen, and is in the same year as Yu\u2019er? How could I possibly say such a shameful thing? The little aunts in the Lin family already don\u2019t like me, do you think it\u2019s so easy being the wife of a rich man?\u201d1Ning Qing admitted that she was biased towards Qin Yu. Qin Yu had been clever since young and brought her pride outside.She was having a hard time in such a prestigious family. Lin Qi had already said that they would not have a second child, so she had devoted her life to Qin Yu.1Qin Yu did not disappoint either. She was not only excellent but had also won the favor of Lin Qi.Qin Yu was her hope, so it was not realistic for her to not be biased.Outside the door, Qin Ran raised her foot and kicked the door open, fierce and irritable.4Liked it?

She leaned against the door hinge with a wry smile.Her smile seemed casual, but also very devious.Ning Qing\u2019s doctor\u2019s appointment wasn\u2019t that early, but she lied because she didn\u2019t want to take Qin Ran to school.How awkward she must be feeling now.Qin Yu was a pretty renowned figure in First Middle School and Ning Qing often held parent meetings on campus. Many of them knew her as Qin Yu\u2019s mother.She didn\u2019t really want others to find out that a bad student like Qin Ran was her daughter as well.2She was resisting that fact.Chen Shulan wasn\u2019t so dense as to not realize it and hence, had tried to talk Ning Qing through it.She knew that she hadn\u2019t much time left, but Qin Ran was still young. If she didn\u2019t care about Qin Ran now, no one else would.1None of them expected to see Qin Ran come back.Ning Qing looked at Qin Ran and opened her mouth, but she could barely summon an explanation. \u201cRan Ran, Mom didn\u2019t mean it this way\u2026\u201d1She was a country bumpkin who\u2019d become a wealthy madam.Besides Lin Qi and Lin Jinxuan, everyone else in the Lin family was always looking at her with disdain.Ning Qing took 12 years\u2014with Qin Yu\u2019s glory\u2014to find a place in the family. Although her demeanor seemed to have changed drastically, she still felt inferior deep inside.1With Qin Ran coming back all of a sudden, it wasn\u2019t possible for her not to feel upset.She was simply venting her suppressed emotions on Chen Shulan.Who\u2019d have known that Qin Ran would hear it?Qin Ran\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. With one hand in her pocket, she nonchalantly said, \u201cWhatever.\u201dNing Qing looked at her, stunned.Chen Shulan sighed.\u201cRan Ran, Mom was just hot-headed.\u201d Ning Qing found her voice but still gave herself away as she fiddled with the shawl over her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re back now. I got them to tidy up the bedroom, so you\u2019ll be staying on the third floor from now on. I decorated your room based on Yu\u2019er\u2019s as reference\u2026\u201d1\u201cNo need for that. I\u2019m just here to tell you,\u201d Qin Ran narrowed her pretty eyes and said slowly, \u201cI\u2019m living in the dorm.\u201d3With that, she turned away and went to pack her things on the third floor.There was nothing much, just a black bag, a laptop, and a cellphone.Chen Shulan followed Qin Ran into the room.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea to stay on campus,\u201d Chen Shulan said. She paused before going on, \u201cYou\u2019ve to get along well with your friends, don\u2019t lose your temper too easily\u2026\u201dQin Ran listened to her patiently as she said her piece.1She took a look at the guest room that Ning Qing decorated not too long ago. The colors were warm and welcoming, the sort that Qin Yu would like, but that Qin Ran was not quite used to.She took her time to pack her bag before zipping it up finally.Chen Shulan eyed her. \u201cRan Ran, why did you lie to your mom?\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Qin Ran slung her bag on her arm and looked at Chen Shulan, urging her to go on.\u201cYou were already very skilled at playing the violin when you were nine.\u201d Chen Shulan put her hand to her forehead as she glanced at the warm-colored room.1Qin Ran preferred cool colors, and even her clothes were all black, white, or of dull shades.\u201cThe renowned teacher had come over to live in Ninghai Village for six months, and she\u2019d wanted to take you in as her disciple. Why didn\u2019t you tell your mom that?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to tell her about,\u201d Qin Ran casually said as she rested her hand on Chen Shulan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, Little Aunt said Mom was very pretty when she was younger, and you doted on her the most. Now that she\u2019s brought you over here to take care of you, you can just recuperate in peace. I\u2019ll come to visit you once my vacation break begins.\u201d2To be fair, Ning Qing was very respectful and filial towards Chen Shulan.The elderly liked having their children and grandchildren around them, and Qin Ran knew that was the same for her.They headed downstairs together.Ning Qing was left stunned as she sat on the couch in the living room.She saw Qin Ran head down the stairs with her bag slung over her shoulder.She stood up, realizing that Qin Ran meant it when she said she was moving into the dorm.1Qin Ran did not bring along anything she\u2019d prepared for her, whether it be the whole wardrobe of pretty clothes or the branded backpack.1Ning Qing had no idea how to respond, or what to say to this situation.How could anyone not like living in a villa, wearing branded clothes or carrying branded bags?3\u201cI\u2019m going to school, I\u2019m counting on you to take care of Grandma. I\u2019ll head to the hospital when I\u2019m on vacation break.\u201d Qin Ran had one hand in her pocket and her eyes looked cold and distant.The Lin household wasn\u2019t very far away from the school, and they had their very own nutritionist.Year 3 students had a rather hectic workload, and it was all the more stressful in First Middle School. Any family that could afford to have parents stay home to guide their children would do it, rather than have them stay on campus.Ning Qing also knew that it would be better for Qin Ran to live at home.But as she watched Qin Ran head towards the door, she remembered that a few sisters-in-law and relatives of the Lin family were coming over in a few days. Eventually, she decided not to ask Qin Ran to stay.1Ning Qing got the chauffeur to send Qin Ran to school. \u201cYour elder brother and younger sister are all\u2026 forget it, just study hard.\u201dAs she saw Qin Ran leave, the tension she\u2019d been holding inside her dissipated all of a sudden.Chen Shulan walked Qin Ran to the door, and when she offered to accompany her to school, Qin Ran declined.Chen Shulan stood at the main door. She knew that Qin Ran had her own quirks and likes that others found hard to understand.But as she looked at the black bag on her shoulder, Chen Shulan suddenly realized that Qin Ran never even brought her things to the Lin family in the first place.1She\u2019d been planning on living on campus since the beginning.**Qin Ran did not head to the school directly. Instead, she stopped by a bank first.She took a queue number and went to the counter.The lady serving her was stunned when she casually placed her Diamond Card on the countertop. She stared at it for a while before stammering. \u201cI-I will go get our manager, I don\u2019t have the autonomy\u2026\u201d2\u201cMm.\u201d Qin Ran\u2019s fingers casually tapped away on the counter. \u201cI just need to make a transfer.\u201dMost customers who held a Diamond Card wouldn\u2019t come down personally to make any transactions. The bank usually settled things on their behalf.Qin Ran transferred a sum of money, and the manager personally walked her to the door when she was done.1The bank wasn\u2019t far from the school, it was less than 10 minutes on foot.Qin Ran thanked the Lin family chauffeur and got him to head back first.The chauffeur looked at the smiley bank employees and found it odd that she was here since the Lin family members had never come before. But he did not question or comment.Qin Ran took the shortest route to school.It was a sweltering afternoon.\u201cWhere\u2019s the hotel Teacher Xu was talking about?\u201d Lu Zhaoying\u2019s ear stud reflected the bright sunlight as he made a call and kept a lookout.Meanwhile, Cheng Juan was following behind him.The sun was bright and glaring, yet the black top he was in did not make others feel uncomfortable or stuffy. Instead, he exuded an inexplicable coldness.4He was practically expressionless, but still good-looking nonetheless.He was about to find a shady tree to wait under while Lu Zhaoying asked for directions when he saw a few people with brightly colored hair standing at the bend of the road, surrounding a single person.1That person was carrying a black bag and had pale, fair fingers.Draped over her shoulders casually was the First Middle School jacket.Her expression was cold and her looks distinct.Cheng Juan paused.When Lu Zhaoying was done asking for directions and hung up, he witnessed the same situation as well.Liked it?

Why are you out here playing truant at this time?\u201d The leader of the youths puffed a ball of smoke in Qin Ran\u2019s face and chuckled.He looked like a mean person.Qin Ran responded rather seriously, \u201cNo, I applied for leave.\u201dThe few youths seemed a bit stunned. This wasn\u2019t a response they\u2019d ever expected.Qin Ran took a step back.She placed her backpack on the pavement.Lu Zhaoying was not there yet.Qin Ran then removed her school jacket, revealing a plain white t-shirt inside, and then her fair and thin elbows, and finally her slender fingers.Cheng Juan watched her from where he stood.When she put her bag down, she seemed to have glanced at him for a split moment.It was brief eye contact, and all Cheng Juan could see were how pretty her eyes were, and in them, the rebellion of a teenager.His brows were knitted together slightly as he heard that rather pretty girl say, \u201cI\u2019ll give you guys a chance.\u201dOne of the smokers\u2019 eyes landed on her elbow, and he reached out to touch her. \u201cWhoa, how about let us give you a chance instead, accompany us and\u2026\u201dQin Ran took one more step back and sent a strong kick into that guy\u2019s stomach.3Fast and furious.He staggered backward for a few steps but was supported by his underlings. He bent over in agony.One of the underlings stepped forward quickly, seeking revenge.But he\u2019d to get ahold of her first.Qin Ran swiftly turned her body and avoided his grip. Before he knew it, she\u2019d grabbed his collar and punched him hard in the face.He fell backward and reached to touch his nose, and all he saw was blood.Qin Ran did not stop there.The last youngster tried to punch her in the stomach, but she outsmarted him and grabbed his wrist before shoving her whole body weight at him.The scene was pretty quiet.Even Cheng Juan had not fully reacted to the situation.The four hooligans who were at least half a head taller than Qin Ran were now heaving and catching their breaths.2One was on the ground, another was bleeding, and yet another was puking bile.2Liked it?

He was a little unhappy as he watched Qin Ran walk to the school gate. \u201cI was the one who was going to save her, why\u2019d she thank you?\u201dCheng Juan eyed him slowly before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLu Zhaoying took a while before he finally took his eyes off her back view. \u201cHer tactics didn\u2019t seem that unorthodox, but I couldn\u2019t tell what it was either.\u201dIt was one person to four, and she\u2019d beaten them easily with clean, swift moves.As they walked past the four youngsters, Lu Zhaoying paused for a moment and commented, \u201cBrothers, you guys are really lousy.\u201d2Cheng Juan looked in the direction Qin Ran walked in; she seemed to have entered the reception office.He looked away and walked on until he reached an eatery deep in an alley.\u201cBoss Xu.\u201d Lu Zhaoying called out as he saw that the man had already placed his orders.Principal Xu smiled and said something briefly before turning to Cheng Juan. \u201cCheng, what\u2019re you doing here?\u201dWhen Principal Xu first knew that he was going to join the school as the school doctor, he had shaken his head in dismay. He knew that this man wasn\u2019t all that easy to please.Cheng Juan held the teacup. In it was tea of an inferior grade, provided by the eatery. But he did not despise it and went on to sip it as if he was savoring top grade tea leaves.He smiled. \u201cJust here to have a look.\u201dHe then changed the subject. \u201cI heard that Boss Xu has been around here for three years and has been a principal of a school. I just wanted to have some exposure.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to look at here?\u201d Principal Xu smiled, but the melancholy in his voice was unconcealable. \u201cI\u2019ve found a successor.\u201dEven Cheng Juan was shocked, not to mention Lu Zhaoying. If those in the capital city knew that Boss Xu had found a successor, it\u2019d be huge news.\u201cWho\u2019s it?\u201d Lu Zhaoying did not hide his curiosity.\u201cThat person doesn\u2019t wish to take over.\u201d Principal Xu shook his head but did not say more.Lu Zhaoying widened his eyes in disbelief.Cheng Juan sipped his tea quietly and did not probe.Lu Zhaoying could barely contain his curiosity.**Qin Ran went to the reception office to get her luggage.The luggage had already arrived at First Middle School the day before she and Ning Qing arrived in the city.There were two huge and heavy pieces of luggage, too heavy for her to handle on her own. Seeing that she was alone, the uncle in the reception office kindly offered to help her move her items to her room instead.Qin Ran had applied for a room on the second floor, near the end of the corridor\u2014Room 216.It was a six-bedder room, but only three beds were taken so far, while the other three were full of others\u2019 belongings. The beds by the windows were already occupied, so Qin Ran picked the bed with the fewest items piled on it.She then went to get a bedsheet.She opened one luggage and unpacked her clothes and everyday items, arranging them in her wardrobe neatly.As for the other luggage, she simply stuffed it under the bed without even opening it.After packing her belongings and having her meal, she still had about a half-hour to spare before her first afternoon class.She walked past the Arts building on the way to her classroom.The windows were open on the second floor and she could see the musical instruments in the room.Qin Ran went up to the second floor. There were few people around and it was very quiet.She opened the door to the music room and saw a violin right in the middle.She loved the violin, it made her feel peaceful.She lowered her head.She\u2019d look for a place to play the violin every once in a while.\u201cYoung Master Xu, I\u2019m being serious. That new transfer student is so damned beautiful, a whole class could stare at her\u2026\u201d Qiao Sheng got excited as he spoke with a can of Cola in his hand.Nobody mentioned that she was Qin Yu\u2019s sister.Xu Yaoguang did not bother about Qiao Sheng; in his hand was a cup of vanilla milk tea that he got for Qin Yu.His handsome features were exuding a certain coldness, making it clear that he was disinterested in the transfer student that Qiao Sheng was talking about.They walked past the Arts building.Xu Yaoguang suddenly stopped in his tracks.A mellow, melancholic violin melody was heard.He looked up at the second floor and his eyes lit up.Qiao Sheng did not know much about music and simply had his eyes on Qin Yu because she was the School Belle.The music made him feel a little uncomfortable, not because it wasn\u2019t a good tune, but because the oppression that he could hear in it tugged at his heartstrings.He was about to say that it sounded pretty good when he saw Xu Yaoguang turning away and walking towards the building.Qiao Sheng was stunned for a moment before moving to catch up. \u201cYoung Master Xu, where are you going?\u201dXu Yaoguang did not respond, but he quickened his footsteps.He opened the door to the music room.The melody ceased abruptly. The music room was empty and the windows were open.Xu Yaoguang paused.\u201cWhere did this person go?\u201d Qiao Sheng found it odd too; they were listening to it just a moment ago. He walked towards the window. \u201cCould he possibly have jumped from the second floor?\u201dXu Yaoguang did not say a thing, but his eyes shifted from the open windows to the violin in the middle of the room.Xu Yaoguang only snapped out of it when someone entered for practice.Xu Yaoguang leaned against the piano casually and suavely, asking the girl who\u2019d just entered, \u201cDid anyone come in at noon for practice?\u201dThe girl looked confused.Xu Yaoguang repeated his question.\u201cThe teacher did not arrange for any practice sessions at noon.\u201d The girl looked at Xu Yaoguang cautiously and stammered. \u201cBut only Qin Yu knows how to play the violin.\u201dXu Yaoguang was stunned for a moment but did not respond. His handsome features were rather warm and kind, but those eyes were strikingly cold, making him unapproachable.He did not say more as he walked out of the music room and headed for the First Class to hand Qin Yu her milk tea.She wasn\u2019t in the classroom at the moment.Xu Yaoguang narrowed his eyes and thought for a bit before deciding to just leave it on her desk.Most of the First Class students were already used to his presence every now and then, but a lot of them still had their eyes on him.Meanwhile, Qiao Sheng was leaning against the doorframe casually and making small talk with the girls sitting in the first row.Seeing that Xu Yaoguang was leaving the classroom, he smiled. \u201cDo you think it was School Belle Qin who was in the violin room just now?\u201dXu Yaoguang did not respond to that question.**Ninth Class.Qin Ran sat at her desk.She arranged her books and got her pen out to write her name.She rested her head on her right palm and held the pen in her left hand.Her slightly tilted head made her look even prettier than she already was.Practically everyone in the classroom was stealing glances at her.Qin Ran\u2019s deskmate, Lin Siran, took a long while to prepare herself for this moment. \u201cHello, Qin Ran. I\u2019m Lin Siran, a student committee member for Studies. You can come to me if you need any help.\u201dQin Ran turned around to face her deskmate, before breaking into a smile. She didn\u2019t look so cold, after all. \u201cHello.\u201dLin Siran blushed a little. \u201cAre you a left-hander?\u201d\u201cYou can say so.\u201d Qin Ran wrote a little slowly with her left hand, but she wasn\u2019t in a rush.\u201cThe Mathematics teacher gave us a paper this morning. I have to collect it and hand them in before class starts,\u201d Lin Siran quietly said.Qin Ran found the paper she was referring to, skimmed through it and then stuffed it under her desk.She was in a much better mood than yesterday and did not appear as distant or hot-tempered.She tilted her head and smiled, asking sweetly, \u201cCan I not hand it in?\u201d1Lin Siran blushed a bright pink, grabbed the stack of papers and dashed to the office.Qin Ran took a book out of her bag and lazily wrote her name on it.There were too many people in the classroom who were checking Qin Ran out, more so than in the morning.Even guys from other classes were hovering by the front door and peering at her.Qin Ran was used to such attention and did not give a hoot about them. She put on her earphones and tapped away at her cell phone, playing an online game that had recently become popular.The guys surrounding her were shoving one another, but not a single one dared to approach her directly.A while later, Qiao Sheng and Xu Yaoguang returned.Qiao Sheng nudged Xu Yaoguang on the shoulder and excitedly said, \u201cLook, that\u2019s Qin Ran!\u201dXu Yaoguang took his book out and got ready for the next lesson. He seemed distant and disinterested.He did not even look up.A classmate with crew-cut hair chuckled softly as he scrolled on his cell phone. \u201cQiao Sheng, when have our Young Master Xu ever laid eyes on anyone else?\u201d\u201cShut your damn mouth.\u201d Qiao Sheng kicked his chair and asked, \u201cWhy are there so many people outside?\u201d\u201cLooking at that new student.\u201d That same classmate said, his eyes still fixed on his phone screen.He suddenly stopped scrolling and raised his cell phone up high. \u201cMy\u2026 gosh!\u201dQiao Sheng turned around and looked at his screen.It was a forum page of First Middle School\u2014[Absolute beauty! Is that the School Belle Qin Yu!]Beneath the title was a picture.In the picture were a few hooligans along the streets. They looked wounded and some bloodstains could be seen on the floor. Not too far away stood a girl dressed in the First Middle School uniform.She was slim and her smile was radiant. She looked pretty laid-back, and even though the picture was pixelated, her pretty face was a clear focus.There were more than 500 replies to that post.2I: Hand me all the details of this girl!3I: This isn\u2019t how Qin Yu looks like\u2026It didn\u2019t take long for a fellow classmate of the Ninth Class to post a reply as well.The classmate with the crew-cut hair lowered his voice and tried to suppress his excitement. \u201cThe School Belle of First Middle School has changed!\u201dQin Ran was oblivious to all that was happening.She still had her earphones on as she played her game.Gu Xichi\u2019s call came in, and she hung up nonchalantly.The other party called again.Qin Ran sped up and finished up the round quickly.She then got up and walked out.As she moved, everybody\u2019s gazes followed.The classroom that was filled with chatter suddenly quietened.A group of people gathered at the back door.Qin Ran removed her earphones with one hand and glanced at them.She looked them in the eye.Everyone made way instantly.1Qin Ran got past the crowd and headed straight for the restroom at the end of the corridor.Gu Xichi\u2019s call came in once again.She found a cubicle, sat on the toilet cover and picked up the call.The Middle East.Gu Xichi had just treated the wounds of a child and was ruffling his head gently. He held the phone to his ear and walked away.After lighting a cigarette for himself, he smiled. \u201cYou haven\u2019t replied to my text message this morning, and now you\u2019re hanging up on me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in school.\u201d Qin Ran was fiddling with the earphones. \u201cCut to the chase, my class is starting soon.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something.\u201d Gu Xichi puffed a ball of smoke, received a first aid kit from someone and thanked him before going on. \u201cI\u2019ve looked into the documents you gave me.\u201d\u201cWhat did you find?\u201dGu Xichi paused for a while before saying, almost in a slur, \u201cBabe, I got the Interpol to investigate it. But why did I see your name in the Interpol list? Did my eyes play tricks on me?\u201d2Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He seemed to chuckle a little, his voice gentle and sweet. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty confident.\u201dThe bathroom door banged and someone came in.Qin Ran gave a faint \u201cyeah\u201d, then lowered her voice. \u201cWhat the hell did you see?\u201dBut Gu Xichi would not lie to her.\u201cYour name was on the list. They\u2019re investigating you.\u201d Gu Xichi smiled at the little boy who handed him a candy. Then, he squinted his eyes and walked in the other direction. \u201cDid you leak your own information accidentally when you helped me check for stuff last time?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s even more impossible. No one can find it.\u201d Qin Ran stood up, her eyebrows raised slightly, and she casually tucked her fringe behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019m hanging up if you have nothing else to say.\u201d1Several girls were whispering outside.Qin Ran opened the door of the compartment and went out.The girls were not here for the toilet and they just stood beside the sink. Qin Ran saw Qin Yu in the middle immediately.Qin Yu pursed her lips and acted as if she didn\u2019t know Qin Ran. She stood among the girls without even raising her head.The whispering voice disappeared instantly because someone suddenly came out of the compartment.The whole building was suddenly quiet.1Qin Ran pushed her phone back into her pocket and walked two steps forward. The hair on the side of her head slipped. \u201cI want to wash my hands, thank you.\u201dThe group of girls backed away.They couldn\u2019t help but look at her.When Qin Ran washed her hands and left, the girls reacted.Qin Yu pursed her lips.The girls looked at each other. Qin Ran\u2019s face was too recognizable and a baby-faced girl recognized her quickly. \u201cShe is Qin Ran? She looks\u2026\u201dAnother girl saw Qin Yu\u2019s expression and immediately poked her waist.The babyfaced girl almost bit her tongue and immediately changed her tune. \u201cShe looks average. The boys are acting like they haven\u2019t seen a girl before. Qin Yu, don\u2019t care about what they\u2019re saying on the forum. She fights and skips classes, and even messes around with the other high school students. She\u2019s obviously not a decent girl.\u201d**The first lesson in the afternoon was Gao Yang\u2019s math class.Before class, Qiao Sheng took out his mobile phone and found the post on the forum. He kicked the chair in front of him and handed his mobile phone to Xu Yaoguang. \u201cYoung Master Xu, the campus belle is changed. It\u2019s Qin Yu\u2019s sister, look at it?\u201dXu Yaoguang was doing a math problem and he didn\u2019t even glance at him. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the lesson to start.\u201d\u201cDamn you!\u201d Qiao Sheng took back his phone and saved the photo by himself.1The teenager sitting beside him laughed. \u201cYoung Master Xu only has Qin Yu in his heart. Qiao Sheng, you can forget about it.\u201dQiao Sheng held a pen in one hand and his cell phone in his other hand. He looked at a campus forum of First Middle School and, after a while, he suddenly said, \u201cDid she really fight with the group of high school students?\u201d\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Several boys around him were very concerned about Qin Ran\u2019s affairs, and they immediately turned over.Qiao Sheng pointed at a post above and frowned. \u201cShe has provoked Wei Zihang\u2019s group. After school, they want to go find her.\u201dAt the mention of Wei Zihang, everyone in the back row all snorted.They glanced at Xu Yaoguang and were afraid to speak.Previously, only Lin Jinxuan could match up with Wei Zihang, but he had already graduated two years ago.There was only Xu Yaoguang now.However, Young Master Xu was cold and spoke little even to Qin Yu. It seemed like he had a bad impression of the new campus belle and probably wouldn\u2019t help her out. Thus, she would only have a hard time in school from now on.Qin Ran supported her chin and sat down with her back leaning against the wall. She closed her eyes and lowered her head halfway so that her fringe fell over and crossed her brow bone.At the end of the afternoon class, Lin Siran handed over her notes to Qin Ran and whispered, \u201cDo you want to look at it?\u201dQin Ran sat up and took it slowly.She kept the paper and smiled lightly at her deskmate. \u201cThanks. Do you know where I can buy books?\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Lin Siran blushed. Sure enough, even though her new deskmate looked fierce, she was still easy-going. \u201cI\u2019ll take you there.\u201d1Qin Ran wanted to buy extra-curricular books, so Lin Siran took her out of school.She tutored her about the school on the way.\u201cThere\u2019s someone you must not mess with in our school.\u201d Lin Siran had been from Junior Middle School, so she knew everything about First Middle School. \u201cClass 3.1\u2019s Qin Yu. Before you, she was our campus belle.\u201dQin Ran had one hand in her pocket and her other hand held her phone. She raised her eyebrows when she heard this.\u201cQin Yu is from the Lin family. She is very powerful and is in the top five of our school. Not only is she pretty, but she can also even play the violin. Every afternoon when she has lessons, many people will go over to watch her. Most importantly, Young Master Xu is protecting her.\u201d Li Siyu lowered her voice. \u201cSome girls who didn\u2019t like Qin Yu have been taken care of by Young Master Xu last time.\u201dThe two talked as they walked outside the school.The third year of high school was released late, and many people had hurried home from school for dinner. Hence, the road was very clean.Not far away.\u201cQin Yu, I heard your brother is back.\u201d Qiao Sheng held a cigarette and lit it while smiling.He used to call her Campus Belle Qin. Qin Yu\u2019s expression remained the same. \u201cYeah.\u201dXu Yaoguang stood by her side, and although he wasn\u2019t warm nor cold, his attitude was much gentler.Qiao Sheng laughed. \u201cI want to have half of your brother. So my dad won\u2019t deduct my pocket money.\u201dHe took a puff, and before he even looked up, he heard the roar of a locomotive in his ear.It was very loud. Qiao Sheng rubbed his ears and stepped aside while cursing.The locomotive stopped not far ahead, and it was clear that they were surrounding two girls.At the front was a fiery red locomotive.2Obstructed by the locomotive, one of the girls\u2019 thin, arrogant figure looked extremely familiar.Qin Yu took a step back and lowered her eyes. \u201cWei Zihang is in front. Shall we go a different way?\u201dXu Yaoguang frowned. There were two girls in front of him, facing away from him. He couldn\u2019t see their faces, but one of their thin backs looked pretty arrogant.Before he spoke, Qiao Sheng said, \u201cQin Yu, go back first. If there\u2019s a fight here, it won\u2019t be good if you get injured.\u201dQiao Sheng had specifically detoured here.1Qin Yu glanced at Xu Yaoguang. He wasn\u2019t bothered by the chaos in front of him, and his eyebrows were relaxed and calm as usual, so she was relieved. \u201cMy driver is over there, I\u2019ll go back first.\u201d She paused and said, \u201cGo back soon too.\u201dQin Yu got into the car, but the driver didn\u2019t drive immediately. He said hesitantly, \u201cMiss, in front, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m hungry, let\u2019s go back soon.\u201d Qin Yu tilted her head and smiled.2The driver immediately started the engine and drove away.Over there, Lin Siran\u2019s face turned pale as she looked at the locomotive surrounding them. She clutched Qin Ran\u2019s hand.4\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d She looked at the teenager sitting on the red locomotive with his eyes narrowed as if he were looking at his prey. Her voice was tight and her palms were sweaty. \u201cIt\u2019s the high school bully.\u201d1Lin Siran fidgeted nervously when suddenly, a low hoarse voice laughed behind her.Liked it?

She turned to the side and looked at the locomotive teenagers around her plainly.2Why was this girl still laughing\u2026There were too many legends about the school bully\u2026 the thought of it turned Lin Siran\u2019s legs into jelly.She clutched Qin Ran\u2019s wrist, her knuckles raised and her fingertips white.Not far away.\u201cYoung Master Xu, Wei Zihang and the others who bullied our classmates are right in front of you.\u201d Qiao Sheng was also anxious. He bit his cigarette, touched his hair, and raised his eyebrows at Xu Yaoguang.Xu Yaoguang raised his eyebrows. His appearance was mild, but his eyes were cold. \u201cWhat does it have to do with you\u2026\u201dHis gaze fell on the tightly-enclosed crowd in front of him. In the middle, the girl with her back to him stood there lazily. She was rather tall and skinny and didn\u2019t look over.In the setting sun, her face was bright and demonic, her expression cold and arrogant, and she looked clearly like a bandit.3Her unshakable fierceness made people shiver.Xu Yaoguang paused. It was no wonder Qiao Sheng had dragged him here too. This scene was indeed rare.\u201cYoung Master Xu, why did you stop?\u201d Xu Yaoguang didn\u2019t answer, so Qiao Sheng grew anxious. His hair was short and stiff and showed off his obstinance. \u201cWei Zihang that dude has gotten out of his car. Okay, forget about it if you don\u2019t like our new classmate. But you\u2019ve known that girl in the student committee for two years, can you really leave her to die?\u201dXu Yaoguang seemed a little silent, so Qiao Sheng didn\u2019t think much about it and just thought that he had agreed.He took a step forward and said loudly, \u201cStudent committee member, bring the new classmate over here and make way for Wei Zihang.\u201dQiao Sheng\u2019s voice was quite anxious.As Lin Siran heard Qiao Sheng\u2019s voice, she lowered her eyes and pursed her lips tightly, her body tense, and her large school uniform making her seem extremely small and delicate.Holding Qin Ran\u2019s hand tightly, she raised her foot and walked in Qiao Sheng\u2019s direction.Wei Zihang was famous for his fierceness. When he just transferred to the school back then, he became the leader of the local blacks.They had thought he was finished, but in the end, they were wrong.His reputation as the school bully spread widely.His legends in First Middle School were all about his evil deeds. He had a large background, and even the underworld didn\u2019t dare to mess with him.1How could these ordinary students possibly afford to mess with him?Even Lin Siran, a good student, had heard of this fierce name.After hearing Qiao Sheng\u2019s words, she quickly pulled Qin Ran and wanted to drag her away.However, Qin Ran\u2019s feet stayed rooted to the ground.She couldn\u2019t be dragged away.Holding his cigarette, Qiao Sheng grew anxious at the situation and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cDamn it. What\u2019s wrong with this new campus belle, does she want to fight? Wei Zihang isn\u2019t so easy to mess with. Young Master Xu, say something!\u201dThis new campus belle really had an arrogant temper and was extremely wild. She was really a newborn calm who wasn\u2019t afraid of tigers.Wei Zihang and his followers all had a bad reputation in Yun Cheng University, and the students there were all afraid of him. He had always been lawless and no one could restrain him.After Lin Jinxuan graduated, he only feared Xu Yaoguang a little.1The two gangs were extremely disagreeable, and their main interaction was the welcome meeting for the new First Middle School\u2019s students.Qin Yu was quite famous. One day, Wei Zihang and his party barged in and mocked that Qin Yu\u2019s violin was not good. Xu Yaoguang immediately went against Wei Zihang.At that time, Qin Yu\u2019s violin was in the eighth grade.Everyone thought he had deliberately picked a fight.And Xu Yaoguang was a freshman at that time. He had just transferred over, and Wei Zihang did not provoke him in the end.Since that incident, Qiao Sheng knew that Wei Zihang feared Xu Yaoguang.Now that Qin Ran was being so stubborn, Qiao Sheng couldn\u2019t help but want to slip away in her place and cursed her under his breath.Did she want to die?!1Lin Siran watched as the school bully got out of his car, her face turning even paler. She said in a trembling voice, \u201cQin Ran, we have to go quickly\u2026 I\u2019ll explain it to you later.\u201dShe was still pulling on Qin Ran, her palms sweaty and trembling horribly.This reaction was extremely normal for when an ordinary student saw the school bully that even the underworld didn\u2019t dare touch.Qin Ran patted Lin Siran\u2019s shoulder. Her expression remained unchanged and she stuck her hand in her pocket loosely, squinting at them.She still acted like a big boss, wild and crazy.But Lin Siran was not comforted. Her legs were soft and she couldn\u2019t move.She was almost falling into a coma.2The teenager in front walked towards them. He had a pair of phoenix eyes, a distinct silhouette, and a mysterious aura. White smoke burned between his fingers and his whole being could only be described as evil.Seeing that Wei Zihang was walking over himself, Qiao Sheng finally moved. The group of people not far away also thought that this new student was finished.Xu Yaoguang looked at Wei Zihang. His clear and dark eyes changed slightly and he was about to say something.But then, he heard Qin Ran say, \u201cWei Zihang, get someone to send my deskmate back. She can\u2019t walk.\u201dThe scene fell silent.2Wei Zihang glanced at Lin Siran and immediately laughed. It was an easygoing laugh that didn\u2019t sound like a school bully at all. He immediately turned and picked a teenager who looked like a good student to send Lin Siran over.Then, he came over again and looked at Qin Ran. He smiled, the surprise at the bottom of his eyes serious. \u201cCome on, Sister Ran, how could you not tell me that you\u2019re in Yun Cheng?\u201d2Qin Ran tugged at her school uniform.\u201cIt was decided too last-minute.\u201d The letter from President Xu was already from a year ago.3Wei Zihang was still dissatisfied. He was handsome and had defined features. \u201cThen, why didn\u2019t you come to find me.\u201d\u201cI only arrived yesterday.\u201d Qin Ran motioned to Lin Siran, but when she saw that Lin Siran was still stunned and didn\u2019t respond, she turned to her side and kicked Wei Zihang. She raised her eyebrows and said, \u201cTell your little brothers to get lost quickly, they\u2019re scaring my deskmate.\u201dWei Zihang let his younger brothers walk away quickly.Lin Siran was obviously not in a good state, so Qin Ran was ready to buy books by herself.The boy beaten by Qin Ran at noon didn\u2019t walk away. His colorful hair drooped and he was almost about to kneel. \u201cBoss, she\u2026 she\u2019s\u2026\u201dWearing a jacket, Wei Zihang crushed his cigarette rather gracefully. He glanced over coldly, and the corners of his lips curled up in an evil way when he heard the question. \u201cMy ancestor.\u201d7After speaking, he didn\u2019t even wait for them to respond.\u201cSister Ran, where are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m buying a book,\u201d she replied concisely.\u201cI\u2019ll go with you\u2026\u201dAs his voice drifted away, Lin Siran, who was still rooted to the same spot, still did not respond.The little brother of the school bully, who she had been so terribly afraid of, said carefully to her, \u201cSister, are you going back to school? Or are you going to eat?\u201dLin Siran\u2019s head was a bit empty.She felt like she was dreaming.Not far away, Qiao Sheng\u2019s side was also silent. Even Xu Yaoguang could not react for a while.Qin Ran was much calmer. She just got a few books and her phone vibrated a few times.She took it out casually.It was an undisclosed number\u2014[There is a new mission specifically asking for you. Do you want it?]Liked it?

He flipped through the books selected by Qin Ran and realized that they weren\u2019t study materials but original copies of foreign books. They were books that were of no interest to anyone.He knew that Qin Ran liked to read books. Chen Shulan\u2019s entire study was full of her books and she especially liked reading the original text.Wei Zihang had seen the original \u201cHundred Years of Solitude\u201d and \u201cKite Chaser\u201d on her bedside.11He put the books on the cash register. His shredded hair drooped slightly, and only his dark eyes were sharp.Wei Zihang paid and Qin Ran didn\u2019t fight over it with him.After returning her message, she put her phone back in her pocket and walked outside first.Wei Zihang took the bag and walked towards her. He held the cigarette that was almost gone and was about to throw it in a trash can.\u201cWe\u2019ll have dinner first?\u201d Wei Zihang waved his hand in front of her and tilted his head with a smile.Qin Ran shook her head. She had to go back to the dormitory and study by herself.\u201cGive me one stick.\u201d She glanced at him.\u201c\u2026\u201d Wei Zihang knew what she was saying. He flinched back and sulked. \u201cNo, Grandma Chen will kill me.\u201d3Qin Ran kicked him and stared at him with her good-looking bandit eyes.Reluctantly, Wei Zihang took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, took one out and handed it to Qin Ran. Then, he passed the lighter over.His lighter was the friction-type. Qin Ran\u2019s fingers were thin and long. They looked like jade and glowed a healthy pink.With a slight \u201cclick\u201d sound, blue flames burst out.The faint smoke rose, and the smell of mint it emitted wasn\u2019t obvious. Qin Ran wore a jeans white T-shirt with a junior high school uniform hung loosely around it.She appeared obedient but still had to do some disobedient things.Her soft and fluffy hair draped over her shoulders. The wind blew past and gently ruffled her hair.She lowered her eyes and leaned casually against the wall. Smoke rose from her fingertips and she appeared lazy and casual. There was also a sort of calmness that hadn\u2019t been in her these few days.Her smoking position was extremely handsome.1Wei Zihang squatted at the intersection to help her keep a lookout. He couldn\u2019t help but glance back, frowning.Qin Ran\u2019s smoke was given by him. A few years ago, Qin Ran had knocked on his door, drenched in blood. He didn\u2019t know just what she had experienced.He didn\u2019t ask her much about her affairs. He didn\u2019t know how to comfort other people. He had learned how to smoke when he was a kid, and smoking was a psychological need for them.That night, he had smoked cigarettes with Qin Ran for the whole night before she was fine.It was just that Qin Ran was different from him. She didn\u2019t smoke much, but when she was extremely vexed, she would hide in his house and smoke.When she got found out, he had been beaten by his grandmother. She just had to look at the two old grandparents with her innocent eyes and they believed that he had tricked her into smoking.3\u201cSmoking is not good.\u201d Wei Zihang surveyed the street depressedly. He retracted when he saw that no one was on the street and tried to persuade her bitterly.Now he wished he could go back to a few years ago and strangle himself before he could give her a cigarette.After smoking half of it, Qin Ran snuffed it and threw it into the trash can.She took two steps back and straightened her hair. When she heard Wei Zihang\u2019s voice, she glanced at him lazily and chuckled lowly. \u201cGet lost.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve reflected on myself many times. How could I have taken you on this crooked road?\u201d Wei Zihang pulled his collar.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Qin Ran told Wei Zihang to pass the books to her. Her voice was faint, but her eyebrows gathered and she had a cynical smile. \u201cI was never a good person.\u201d\u201cYou are a good person.\u201d Wei Zihang was extremely serious.Qin Ran walked forward with the bag and waved in Wei Zihang\u2019s direction. \u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t understand me.\u201dShe returned to her dormitory. There was no one inside, so she had a short time for late self-study. The seniors basically all returned to class after their meals.Qin Ran placed the book on her desk.She opened an iron box on her bed, took a white sleeping pill from it, and swallowed it.After taking the medicine, she didn\u2019t go to her class immediately. Instead, she took out her black backpack, unzipped it, and took out the very heavy black cell phone.The phone screen was still black.She pressed the screen and turned on the power button.In less than a second, the phone lit up, but it was not the main page. A map page with a red dot on it appeared, which landed in the school medical office.**At the same time.In the Lin family house.Lin Jinxuan didn\u2019t go out today. The family sat at the table to eat.Lin Qi asked about Qin Ran, and when he heard that she was staying in school, Lin Qi was surprised. But he didn\u2019t say anything and instead asked about Principal Xu.\u201cDo you know President Xu?\u201dNing Qing didn\u2019t know of President Xu, but Lin Jinxuan, who had returned from the imperial capital, had news.Ning Qing placed a spoonful of vegetables on Qin Yu\u2019s plate. \u201cI heard from my mother that President Xu went to Ninghai Village to help the poor three years ago.\u201dEveryone at the dining table spoke about Qin Ran for several minutes.Qin Yu\u2019s spoon clang against the bowl.Several people looked at her, and Lin Qi was concerned. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d\u201cAfter school at night, I thought I saw my elder sister.\u201d Qin Yu hesitated. \u201cShe was with people from Zi High School.\u201d\u201cZi High School?\u201d Ning Qing\u2019s voice rose slightly and her knuckles turned white. \u201cIsn\u2019t she in First Middle School?\u201dQin Yu\u2019s eyes were downcast and she squeezed the spoon in her hand. \u201cI heard that she was fighting with them at noon, and those people came over at night. I\u2019m a little worried about her\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need to worry!\u201d Ning Qing said coldly. Her eyes seemed to hide a sword as she looked at Qin Yu. Then, she suppressed her anger and lowered her voice. \u201cStudy well and don\u2019t care about your sister even if she comes to find you.\u201dShe was furious.Ning Qing couldn\u2019t possibly finish her meal now.Lin Qi was still eating without asking much.Qin Ran was only his stepdaughter, and he had already been benevolent enough to be able to help her arrange for her accommodation and school.6If the other party was like Qin Yu, he may be a little more worried, but there was nothing about Qin Ran that deserved his attention.He was too busy with his business, so how could he have the time?\u201cTidy up the third floor and make a study for Yu\u2019er.\u201d Lin Jinxuan didn\u2019t care about their discussions. He was genuinely curious about Qin Ran, but it was no match for his affection towards Qin Yu.A genius like Lin Jinxuan whose life went smoothly rarely put anyone to heart.Ning Qing\u2019s expression also eased.She wouldn\u2019t be giving birth to more children, so the Lin family would still be Lin Jinxuan\u2019s. It was important to her to obtain Lin Jinxuan\u2019s regard.Lin Jinxuan was indifferent to her, but he was fond of Qin Yu.She could only rely on Qin Yu for her position in the Lin family.It would be easy as long as they were in a good relationship.Qin Yu smiled sweetly. \u201cThank you, brother.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll answer a phone call.\u201d Lin Jinxuan nodded slightly. He pulled his chair and got up, then walked upstairs with his mobile phone.There was a very mild and apologetic middle-aged tone on the other end of the phone. \u201cMr. Lin, we can\u2019t take your order.

    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: Because I Am Really FamousPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios\u201cSorry, it\u2019s for personal reasons, so I don\u2019t know either.\u201d The voice over the phone was still very polite.Lin Jinxuan hung up regretfully.He looked down and his eyelashes were downcast, hiding his expression.He wasn\u2019t in the mood to continue his dinner downstairs anymore, so he sat in a chair in the study and looked at his phone, slightly annoyed.But within five minutes, a message arrived saying that a refund had been made.\u201cAre you in trouble?\u201d Not long after, Lin Qi pushed open the door and asked casually.Lin Jinxuan had always been a genius. When he was a freshman, he started a company with others. Though Lin Qi wasn\u2019t clear about the specific content, he knew that Lin Jinxuan had his own opinions.He rarely saw him so anxious that he wouldn\u2019t even eat.Lin Jinxuan nodded with a frown.He took out a cigarette but didn\u2019t light it, and just played with it in his hands. His gentle face was terribly dull and irritableness showed between his eyebrows.\u201cJust a little.\u201d After a short while, he sighed.He didn\u2019t say more.After finally contacting those people, he had even spent a lot of money, only to get rejected in the end.1**At First Middle School.Qin Ran didn\u2019t go for self-study.She looked up at the door of the school\u2019s medical office, where the light was still turned on.The school doctors worked at night from 6 to 9 o\u2019clock.When she reached, Lu Zhaoying was dealing with a little girl.No matter what, after coping with little girls for a whole day, Lu Zhaoying was already a little impatient, but he still politely responded.After finally getting the girl with ulterior motives to leave, he looked up and saw the big boss who had fought in the noon standing just a few meters away from him.Qin Ran was born pretty. Her legs were straight and slender, her eyelashes long and dense, drooping slightly.\u201cClassmate, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lu Zhaoying suddenly felt refreshed.He put his hands on the table and asked with a smile.Qin Ran narrowed her eyes slightly and glanced at the not too large office before saying casually, \u201cAre you recruiting a part-timer?\u201dLu Zhaoying froze.He looked at Qin Ran.Qin Ran thought for a while and whispered, \u201cSorry for disturbing you. I\u2019m short of money.\u201dYes, she was short of money now.7Lu Zhaoying\u2019s eyes fell on Qin Ran. She was loosely dressed in a school uniform jacket. Inside was a white shirt. The white shirt was probably a few years old and even had furring on it.Compared with the little girl who just came in and took off her school uniform to reveal her beautiful new dress, Young Master Lu, who never had tender, protective feelings for the other sex, suddenly felt a difference.Lu Zhaoying turned his head and glanced at Cheng Juan.Today, all the female students who had come to the school\u2019s medical office had come for him.But he didn\u2019t even show his face.Lu Zhaoying himself wanted to keep her. The school medical office was short of staff, but tomorrow, Cheng Juan\u2019s butler would arrive at Yun Cheng.\u201cSorry\u2026\u201dBefore Lu Zhaoying could finish his sentence, an amused voice sounded from inside. \u201cCan you cook?\u201dThe master of the voice looked up, his beautiful peach blossom eyes half squinting.Qin Ran looked at him, her slightly red eyes hazy and mesmerizing. She nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNoon and evening. We pay by the day. Can you start tomorrow?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter Qin Ran left, Lu Zhaoying reached out and rubbed his chin.He had always been incapable of hiding his thoughts, and his heart of gossip had been ignited, but he didn\u2019t dare provoke Cheng Juan, so he said euphemistically, \u201cHave you forgotten that your butler is coming tomorrow?\u201d\u201cLet him stay in the villa.\u201d Cheng Juan lazily leaned on the back of the sofa, holding his cigarette.Because he had just woken up, his voice was still deliberately lowered.Lu Zhaoying wanted to continue asking, but the phone rang.It was the captain of the Interpol Brigade in Beijing. He covered his mobile phone\u2019s microphone and looked up at Cheng Juan. \u201cIt\u2019s Captain Hao, there\u2019s\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, he was interrupted by Cheng Juan.\u201cLet him go find a professor at the Imperial University.\u201d Cheng Juan couldn\u2019t find his lighter and just put down his cigarette.Lu Zhaoying was silent.When mingling with Cheng Juan, he always felt as if his IQ was too low.1Later, Butler Cheng had told him Cheng Juan\u2019s Wechsler intelligence test results. Lu Zhaoying was unperturbed from then on.He couldn\u2019t understand the genius\u2019 thoughts and communication methods.Lu Zhaoying tidied the documents on his table and suddenly thought of something. \u201cMaster Juan, do you think Elder Xu really found a successor? No way, he doesn\u2019t even think highly of his son and grandson.\u201dThe capital was full of talents, but Elder Xu had spent half his life finding a successor only to fail.Yun Cheng was a small city and was generally ordinary from any angle. Could he have found one here?Cheng Juan squinted and smiled. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to make such a joke.\u201d**Qin Ran returned to class 3.9.In the evening self-study, the Chemistry teacher issued papers with the English and Physics teacher.Self-study time was from 6 to 10 o\u2019clock.The three papers were done, and it was almost 10 o\u2019clock. Even after class, nobody moved.Lin Siran had wanted to say something to Qin Ran. But this was the time to do the papers and she was a good student, so she didn\u2019t dare speak to her and didn\u2019t find an opportunity.Qin Ran put the paper aside and picked up a book she had just bought at night.She looked through it slowly, and when Lin Siran glanced over occasionally, she could see that she was writing with her pen.After waiting for self-study to end and after the representatives of each subject had collected the papers, Lin Siran finally found an opportunity.Lin Siran put the papers aside and looked at Qin Ran and stuttered. \u201cYou\u2026 how come\u2026\u201dQin Ran still held the book in her hand, with her back against the wall. She smirked, and the fluorescent light hit her face, showing a sort of mischievousness in her delicate face. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cJust, just now, why did that school bully\u2026\u201d Lin Siran\u2019s head was muddy.She probably wanted to ask why Wei Zihang seemed to listen to her.Qin Ran closed her book, raised his eyebrows, and said very seriously, \u201cBecause I used to be really famous.\u201d2Lin Siran shuddered and didn\u2019t respond.The back row.Xu Yaoguang put down his pen, and there was still a question in the Physics paper he didn\u2019t answer.\u201cYou can\u2019t do this question either?\u201d Qiao Sheng turned his head. His papers were mostly unanswered, whereas Xu Yaoguang only had one question unanswered.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll ask Qin Yu next time.\u201d Xu Yaoguang looked cold. \u201cI\u2019ll collect the papers first.\u201dHe was the representative of the Physics class.Xu Yaoguang held the paper in his hand and slowly collected from the row of Qin Ran and Lin Siran.The three papers on Qin Ran\u2019s desk were all empty, and only her name was written. Her handwriting wasn\u2019t really good-looking.Xu Yaoguang looked down and remembered Qin Yu\u2019s beautiful calligraphy.\u201cAh, Qin Ran, the Physics teacher is a big devil. His papers must be done. Just copy mine!\u201d Lin Siran immediately pushed her papers to Qin Ran.Xu Yaoguang\u2019s eyes were down and his head was lowered. He was cold and annoyed, so he said something that teachers usually say, \u201cYou might as well not do it if you\u2019re going to copy.\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: Love Letters, Influential FigurePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosQin Ran picked up her pen and copied Li Siran\u2019s paper.She changed a few numbers occasionally.She was quite familiar with it, and it was obvious she was used to copying homework.Her writing wasn\u2019t very smooth, and she was writing fast, so her handwriting was even uglier.2First Middle School was full of nerds, and each student was very disciplined. Except for some rare cases, there was basically no such thing as copying homework.She was sitting in an unruly posture, squinting with her hands still on her chin, and the classroom was quite hot. She took off her school uniform jacket and wore only a shirt.Qin Ran ignored Xu Yaoguang and passed the paper after calmly copying it.Xu Yaoguang didn\u2019t say much, he just took out the paper in Qin Ran\u2019s hands and left.He didn\u2019t even look at Qin Ran again.He had already tried to talk sense into her, but since she was still stubborn about it, he had nothing else to say.5She had to repeat one year and still didn\u2019t know what was good for her. What a waste of the Lin family\u2019s goodwill.4Xu Yaoguang collected from the next row, his eyes frosty as usual.After Qiao Sheng finished his last English paper, he sat on the seat and waited for Xu Yaoguang. When Xu Yaoguang came back, there was a kind of indifferent light in his eyes. He froze but didn\u2019t speak, and just looked at Qin Ran.Before leaving, he even waved to Qin Ran.If it wasn\u2019t for the rush of time tonight and Qin Ran coming late, Qiao Sheng would definitely have gone up to say a few words to the new student.This new student, with long legs and a thin waist, white skin and exceptional beauty. Qin Yu couldn\u2019t compare with her.Her eyebrows were terribly delicate, but the bottom of her eyes was slightly red as if she couldn\u2019t be provoked.The most important thing that Qiao Sheng wanted to talk to Qin Ran about was how she had subdued Zi High School\u2019s bully.Xu Yaoguang sent the paper to the office and went downstairs with Qin Yu.Qin Yu was the representative for Chemistry.Xu Yaoguang asked Qin Yu about the Chemistry paper\u2019s last question. His other subjects were all very good and were far better than everyone else\u2019s, but his Chemistry was a little lacking.2Qin Yu had participated in the provincial competition in the second year of high school for Chemistry, so the two often discussed together.2Xu Yaoguang admired her.\u201cI also thought about this formula. I\u2019ll go back and try again.\u201d The cold look on Xu Yaoguang\u2019s face was a little lighter, and his eyes were also gentler.Qin Yu nodded, and inadvertently asked about the evening again, \u201cMy sister, she\u2026 is she all right?\u201dXu Yaoguang thought of the paper that the other party just copied. He frowned and shook his head, not saying anymore.Seeing Xu Yaoguang\u2019s attitude, Qin Yu smiled but did not speak.**Qin Ran and Lin Siran were in the dormitory with another girl. The other girl was the representative of the English class. She had short hair, a fresh look, and a pair of snobbish eyes.Qin Ran had just transferred here, and the school already had rumors about her fighting. The English representative had also witnessed her copying Lin Siran\u2019s English answer.Furthermore, the students at First Middle School either had their parents accompanying them to school or had their drivers pick them up. Those who stayed in the hostel were mostly not well-to-do.The clothes Qin Ran wore were very average, and they looked like they had been worn for several years.The English class representative fiddled with several bottles of high-end skincare products on her desk, the bottles colliding with each other loudly.Qin Ran put on her pajamas after taking a bath.The pajamas had a large neckline, and she didn\u2019t even care about her appearance. She loosely exposed her large white shoulder which was faintly visible, and there was a fiery red color on her shoulder.It looked like a tattoo.She was already white, so the red tattoo seemed even redder and more obvious.The English class representative gave her one more look.Qin Ran didn\u2019t care. She climbed back on her bed, lowered the curtain and opened the iron box filled with sleeping pills on the bedside. She poured out a pill, thought about it, and poured another pill out. This time, she swallowed without water.She didn\u2019t sleep immediately.1Instead, she turned on the dark-colored lamp and took out an original text to read it slowly.When Lin Siran woke up, she found that the light on Qin Ran\u2019s bed was still slightly on.In the early morning on the next day, Qin Ran and Lin Siran went to their classroom while it was still quite early.The entire campus was almost foggy.Qin Ran sat sideways on a stool, her legs crossed casually. She lazily went to take her extracurricular books from under the table.Pa\u2014Several light blue envelopes fell to the floor.There was also a light pink heart on the envelope.Qin Ran picked it up and put it back again.Lin Siran glared at her. \u201cQin Ran, this is a love letter\u2014there\u2019s several of them!\u201dA few of the students around looked at this.Many people in the class had received love letters, especially Qiao Sheng and Xu Yaoguang, but it was really rare to receive so many letters on just the second day of school.Qin Ran gave a faint hum before opening her extra-curricular book. She leaned against the wall with her long eyelashes drooping down and started flipping through the book absentmindedly.This original book was so new that it looked like it had never been read before.Lin Siran glanced at it and saw that it was in a foreign language she had never seen before.Taking out her own textbook, Lin Siran turned slightly. \u201cAre you not excited about receiving so many love letters?\u201dQin Ran turned another page, and with her movements, the wide sleeves of the school uniform slipped down.\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve never received them before.\u201d3Lin Siran: \u201c\u2026\u201dThey had lunch.The English class representative went to a class downstairs to wait for Qin Yu.Qin Yu was a top student and also had a good family. She was picked up and dropped off by a luxury car every day, and even had a good relationship with Lin Jinxuan, the talented young man on the honor list. Furthermore, Xu Yaoguang was also covering for her.She was the main topic of every boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s discussions.At first glance, it was obvious she wasn\u2019t an ordinary person.Besides the English class representative, most girls in the school wanted to be close to Qin Yu.\u201cShe\u2019s still pretending to read the original text.\u201d The English class representative was talking about how Qin Ran had removed Qin Yu\u2019s status as the Campus Belle and was very dissatisfied. \u201cDo you know, she copied all three papers last night? She doesn\u2019t even understand English, how could she still pretend to read the original text. Our Campus King Xu was so angry with her. I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with the boys in our school. Besides her face, what else does she have\u2026\u201dQin Yu had long known that Qin Ran wasn\u2019t good at studying. She pursed her lips and ate two more bites.**Today Cheng Juan\u2019s kitchen wasn\u2019t ready.Qin Ran only came by in the evening.Qin Ran was going to cook lunch and dinner for Cheng Juan.There was a fine kitchen in the corner of the school doctor\u2019s office. All the ingredients were in it, but there were no vegetables.Cheng Juan was wearing a black shirt with a keychain in his hand. His brows were clearly defined and handsome, and the group of girls dangling in front of the school medical office was giving him a headache.He opened the car door, his figure slender and thin. \u201cThere is a patient with Lu Zhaoying. I\u2019ll bring you to the ingredients first.\u201dCheng Juan drove to a private hotel not far from First Middle School.Qin Ran glanced at it, knowing roughly that this place operated on a private membership card system.Cheng Juan parked his car and lazily put his hands on the steering wheel before answering the phone.Qin Ran opened the door and got out of the car.Ning Qing just parked her car.Today, her sister-in-law from the Lin family came, and Lin Qi had reserved a meal in this private hall half a month in advance.She had come over after doing her spa. The driver parked the car and she got out of the car.As soon as she saw the girl who was wearing a plaid coat, her face froze.The Lin family wasn\u2019t the top big family in Yun Cheng, but it was also famous, and everyone in the Lin family shouldn\u2019t be underestimated.Ning Qing didn\u2019t want to let the relatives of the Lin family see her relatives who were poor and lacked etiquette. She didn\u2019t want the Lin family to mock her.Especially her own daughter, who only fought and even had to repeat a year\u2026It was already extremely difficult to talk about her to ordinary families, let alone in front of the Lin family.That was why Qin Ran was allowed to leave the Lin family residence to live in the school\u2019s hostel.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d She glanced left and right and, after checking that her sister-in-law wasn\u2019t around, quickly walked towards Qin Ran. Her expression was not good.1Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She raised her head slightly, her expression remaining indifferent.Her eyes were dark and not as bright, and the whites were slightly reddish and wild.She said impatiently, \u201cI have matters to attend to.\u201dShe stuck one hand in her pocket and narrowed her eyes slightly.Ning Qing pursed her lips and remembered what Qin Yu had said last time. She lowered her voice and said with a cold face, \u201cDid you fight again yesterday?\u201dIn the car, Cheng Juan answered his phone.Looking up, he saw the girl standing arrogantly beside a woman who was talking to her. The woman\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t very friendly, and she was glancing around furtively like a thief.Both of them had their sides facing him, which looked slightly familiar.He had originally wanted to wait for the hotel to bring in the ingredients. But after seeing this situation, Cheng Juan thought for a while and opened the car door. He got out of the car, the noble outer corner of his eye drooped coldly, his peach blossom eyes hazy and sinister.The man in the hotel ran over sweating with the ingredients.Seeing that he was waiting outside, he quickened his pace and carefully and respectfully handed over a beautifully arranged basket. \u201cMaster Juan, why are you here in person?\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Cheng Juan lifted his chin, his eyes still on Qin Ran. His voice was very low and slightly sloppy. \u201cPut it in.\u201dThe expression on Ning Qing\u2019s face was not very good.\u201cQin Ran, let\u2019s go.\u201d He raised his voice slightly, just to let Qin Ran and Ning Qing hear.The fingers hanging against the door dangled slightly, and his black shirt glowed coldly in the sun, contrasting with his white exposed wrist.Ning Qing froze for a while. Such an outstanding appearance was probably rarely seen in Yun Cheng.Before she could respond, Qin Ran had already walked over with her cell phone.The two got into the car, the black car door closed, and started slowly.Ning Qing took a closer look and realized that it was a very ordinary black car with a Volkswagen brand.But the car\u2019s body didn\u2019t look like it.It was probably a new Volkswagen.Who was this man?Ning Qing finally reacted from the shock. She thought of Qin Ran fighting last night and gritted her teeth. She felt as though Qin Ran was only fooling around in Yun Cheng.She hadn\u2019t asked her about the fight last night and why she wasn\u2019t in school today.Not far away, a sapphire blue sports car came this way.Ning Qing immediately glanced back. She knew the sports car belonged to her sister-in-law.Suddenly, she couldn\u2019t bother about Qin Ran anymore and even moved to the side.So as not to be seen.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Her sister-in-law was well-maintained. In her thirties, her hair was permed and put up with a jade hairpin. She wore a moon-white cheongsam which outlined her good figure. Her eyebrows were delicate and meticulously carved. Her aura was extremely exquisite.Ning Qing was born prettier than her sister-in-law, but at first glance, her aura was lacking.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Ning Qing was relieved when she saw that she hadn\u2019t noticed Qin Ran.But her expression wasn\u2019t very good.If Qin Ran was like Qin Yu, she wouldn\u2019t even wait to show her off. Why would she need to hide her like that?Her sister-in-law didn\u2019t ask much but hesitantly glanced at the car with the Volkswagen brand not far away.Her pretty eyebrows frowned slightly. The license plate was a little familiar.**Red light.\u201cYou will come here to take the side dishes in the future,\u201d Cheng Juan said, placing his hands on the steering wheel and casually tapping his fingers. \u201cWas that your relative?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Qin Ran put her hand on the window, emotionless.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it.\u201d Cheng Juan thought for a moment. \u201cThe BMW she was driving is very valuable, and the Porsche behind her is also very nice.\u201dQin Ran didn\u2019t say anything. She sat in the back seat and supported her chin to watch the stereo on the car.\u201cYour car looks good too.\u201d Qin Ran leaned back. Her long legs were slightly bent and she was playing a game. Her black fringe brushed over her brow bone and she raised her brow as she said.Green light. Cheng Juan started the car and said lightly, \u201cGood? It\u2019s not as expensive as that Porsche, how could it be compared.\u201dQin Ran: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe looked up, staring at the Xingyu stereo on the car, silent.Xingyu was a music company.The quality of Xingyu\u2019s audio equipment was extremely fine and terrifyingly expensive. Generally, only those with abundant money would buy it.There was no coding for this set of speakers on Cheng Juan\u2019s car, so this should be a new product developed in-house.She hadn\u2019t bought it and didn\u2019t know the specific price, but in this case, the minimum it was sold for was 8 million.**Qin Ran did not cook often.But when she cooked, she was very clean. She wasn\u2019t as good as the top chefs, but she did have her own unique taste. Lu Zhaoying, who had not been expecting much, smiled while eating.After eating, Qin Ran was about to keep the plates.Cheng Juan looked up and glanced over Lu Zhaoying. His mood was good as he had just finished dinner, so he said concisely, \u201cGo wash the dishes.\u201dLu Zhaoying, who was drinking tea, was stunned.\u201cMe?\u201dCheng Juan raised his eyebrows and rolled his eyes. \u201cOr should I do it?\u201dWasn\u2019t this Qin Ran\u2019s role?In the end, Lu Zhaoying washed the bowls instead.\u201cGo back to the classroom.\u201d Cheng Juan glanced back from Qin Ran\u2019s hands that looked like an artist\u2019s. He squinted his eyes sleepily.3Qin Ran didn\u2019t want to go back to the classroom. It was too noisy.But she said nothing. She just nodded, took out her coat and went out.There was a rest sign at the school doctor\u2019s room outside at noon. The door was closed, and the sun was over her head. No one was waiting outside the door.Qin Ran put her black peaked cap over her head.She was slender and her coat slackened loosely around her body. She lowered her head and her hair slid across the side of her brain. Her face under her hat was exquisite as she walked away slowly.3Her momentum was strong.A teenager in First Middle School\u2019s jacket walked from the opposite direction.His eyebrows were defined and his temperament was cold. The girls on the road couldn\u2019t help but look over in his direction. Then, they quickly bowed their heads and whispered in a low voice with their cheeks blushed.It was Xu Yaoguang. He passed by Qin Ran without even looking at her.They passed by.Qin Ran went to class 3.9.Xu Yaoguang came to the principal\u2019s office.\u201cCome in.\u201d Principal Xu pushed the glasses on the bridge of his nose. His eyes fell on Xu Yaoguang\u2019s face, his face slightly gentle. \u201cSit.\u201d\u201cGrandpa,\u201d Xu Yaoguang said very respectfully.Principal Xu was the elder of the Xu family. Xu Yaoguang was not particularly clear about their affairs, but he also knew that his relatives were extremely afraid of Grandpa.Since childhood, they had worshipped each other very much.Principal Xu glanced up and down at Xu Yaoguang. This grandson had been excellent since he was a child. The Xu family probably wanted him to inherit their business in the future and he was also outstanding in Beijing.His family history and appearance were all outstanding.\u201cWhat do you think of your classmate, Qin Ran?\u201d Principal Xu held a cup of tea and pondered.At the mention of her, Xu Yaoguang frowned and didn\u2019t speak.Principal Xu thought for a while and said, \u201cThat child has a poor life. She saved me once, and I like her very much. You are the same age, so if you think it\u2019s okay, how about I ask her Grandma to set a date for you two?\u201d6Liked it?

He was wearing First Middle School\u2019s uniform, but his face was bright and mature, and his legs were also long.His eyes were cold and clear, with pride between his eyebrows. His strength of character was obvious.This was the result of a long period of thought by President Xu. In the Xu family, only Xu Yaoguang was outstanding.He wanted to find out Xu Yaoguang\u2019s thoughts first.Xu Yaoguang did not expect that President Xu would talk to him about this. His raised eyebrows were startled. \u201cGrandpa, did you say she saved you?\u201dHe had a lot of things about Qin Ran from Qiao Sheng and had also seen her fight with his own eyes. She also seemed very familiar with the High School group.He had also seen Qin Ran copying homework.Hence, he did not expect that Grandpa would pay such attention to the newly transferred student. He knew that Grandpa\u2019s vision was always high, so he couldn\u2019t understand this.Even if she had saved Grandpa, Grandpa didn\u2019t necessarily have to let her enter the Xu family.Did she ask for it herself? Xu Yaoguang lowered his eyes without saying a word.2\u201cI encountered some trouble when I went to Ninghai Village to help the poor.\u201d As for the specific situation, President Xu didn\u2019t say much.\u201cShe rescued Grandpa, so our Xu family is indeed indebted to her. We can also compensate her in other ways. The Qin family also has other outstanding people.\u201d Xu Yaoguang deliberated, but his brows were still tightly knitted.Principal Xu glanced at Xu Yaoguang and motioned for him to continue.\u201cQin Yu in class 3.1 is her sister. She is very good at Chemistry. She has always been in the first five top positions.\u201d Xu Yaoguang saw that Principal Xu didn\u2019t really understand and continued explaining, \u201cShe was the new student who performed during the first year. She plays the violin exceptionally well and even looks good.\u201dWith that said, Qin Yu\u2019s face appeared in Principal Xu\u2019s mind.He coughed and thought about it further. Now that he had some impressions, he slowly put down the cup in his hand and said, \u201cSo it\u2019s her.\u201dHis voice was faint.With Xu Yaoguang\u2019s words, Principal Xu knew that he was evading it.It was a pity that he didn\u2019t sleep well these days.However, he didn\u2019t want to force it. Principal Xu held his glasses and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I didn\u2019t think it through properly. Go back to your class and think about it.\u201dXu Yaoguang went out and closed the door.He didn\u2019t see Principal Xu hold his teacup in regret and entanglement after he left.1Once he was out of the principal\u2019s room, Xu Yaoguang\u2019s heart, which had been so hung up, finally relaxed.If Grandpa insisted on it, he would have no other choice.Back in the classroom, the paper they had written last night was being distributed. Since he wasn\u2019t there, Qiao Sheng was helping him distribute the Physics paper.Xu Yaoguang subconsciously looked in the direction of Qin Ran.She was holding Lin Siran\u2019s math book and copying her maths questions.Copying homework again.Xu Yaoguang was expressionless. He sat back in his chair with his eyes down and his head lowered. He didn\u2019t look at Qin Ran again.He just took out his paper, picked up a pen and started to apply the formula he had talked to Qin Yu about last time.Lin Siran\u2019s paper was also distributed to her.The answer card was issued. Instead of reading her papers, she took out Qin Ran\u2019s papers and was immediately stunned. \u201cQin Ran, how did you avoid all my correct answers?\u201dEveryone who copied homework often knew that it couldn\u2019t be the exact same.Especially when writing papers, they would have to change several answers.Last night, Lin Siran knew that Qin Ran had changed some answers, but she didn\u2019t expect that she had successfully avoided all the correct answers.With so many multiple-choice questions, there was not one that was correct.Was her luck this bad?Qin Ran didn\u2019t care about her papers. She crossed her legs rudely, put her cap on the window sill, and held her deskmate\u2019s maths book in her hand. She flipped through it casually, her eyelashes looking down.Upon hearing Lin Siran\u2019s voice, she tilted her head and took her paper.With her chin in one hand, she dragged out her voice. \u201cCould it be that\u2026 I\u2019m a genius?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Qiao Sheng laughed out loud from behind.He laid on the table, poked Xu Yaoguang\u2019s back with a pen, and laughed. \u201cYoung Master Xu, do you know, I saw that Qin Ran got zero when I was distributing the papers. She still thinks she did well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get zero when she has written the whole paper.\u201d Xu Yaoguang was stunned. He couldn\u2019t get zero even if he tried.1But after thinking that the person was Qin Ran, Xu Yaoguang just shook his head and thought he was crazy.He took out the papers to be used in the next class and no longer thought about Qin Ran.The first class in the afternoon was English.Li Airong walked around and saw Qin Ran leaning against the wall, her legs propped up rudely while she read her extra-curricular books. She frowned fiercely.But after thinking of this person\u2019s relationship to the Principal, she held herself back and didn\u2019t say anything.**At night.In the Lin family\u2019s house.When Qin Yu went back, she saw Lin Qi and Lin Wan sitting on the sofa in the main hall.Lin Wan was a gentle name, but she was full of aura and her eyebrows were sharp. With one stare, she could make people feel at a loss.Qin Yu called out very obediently, \u201cLittle aunt.\u201d\u201cOh, Qin Yu, you\u2019re so pretty now.\u201d To Qin Yu, Lin Wan\u2019s attitude was much kinder than to Ning Qing.Qin Yu obediently bowed her head. Little aunt had married to Beijing and only returned several times a year.1\u201cI\u2019ll go upstairs to sort out what my mother wants to use and take it to the hospital.\u201d Ning Qing sat uncomfortably and simply found a reason to go upstairs.In addition to reading a book in the evening, Qin Yu also practiced the violin for half an hour.She first accompanied Lin Wan and Lin Qi downstairs for a while before going up to the second floor.When she reached the second floor, Ning Qing had sorted her things out and was walking down with a bag.She didn\u2019t bother Qin Yu and went downstairs after a few words.Turning around, a piece of paper floated down the edge of the bag.The paper was a bit crumpled, and Qin Yu picked it up and opened it, glancing at it. She wanted to stop Ning Qing when she read the contents but suddenly froze.It seemed to be some sort of note, and the handwriting was graffiti-like.The writing on it was a bit scribbled and the lines were messy.Seeing the first line of content, Qin Yu\u2019s heart was agitated. It suddenly jumped and she clenched her hearts tightly.This was a violin notation.1Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She picked up her score and played a few notes by herself, her eyes brightening.Even her heart felt tight.She looked uncertainly at the paper on the table. This was a sheet of music that she hadn\u2019t succeeded in playing for years. The writing on the sheet was wildly scribbled and rubbed on, and it looked like it had been discarded casually by someone.But who did this paper belong to?Qin Yu set the violin aside and leaned slightly on the back of the chair, her eyes hanging low.She had seen Qin Ran\u2019s writing before. The writing wasn\u2019t neat and it was also a little big. It couldn\u2019t be Qin Ran\u2019s. Furthermore, Qin Ran had said that she didn\u2019t play the violin anymore.Qin Yu didn\u2019t know what to think. She dazed off.That night, she was distracted while playing the violin.In the end, when she left, Qin Yu stood in front of the piece of paper for a while. She folded the paper, took it back to the room, and locked it in her own drawer.1**Downstairs.After Qin Yu went upstairs with Ning Qing, Lin Wan and Lin Qi were still talking.\u201cI heard that this acted up again. She\u2019s bringing another child into the marriage?\u201d Lin Wan took a sip of tea and said with a light tone.2Lin Qi smiled gently and elegantly. He held the gold-rimmed glasses on the bridge of his nose and said, \u201cThat will be Qin Ran. The little girl looks good.\u201dLin Wan frowned. She had just returned to Yun Cheng and only knew a little about Qin Ran\u2019s affairs.Lin Qi only said she was good looking.\u201cDon\u2019t hide it from me, I heard that her character isn\u2019t very good?\u201d Lin Wan put the teacup on the table. Her eyes were slightly stern and she sneered. \u201cShe fought and was expelled from school, so she took a year off. Now, she wants you to help her clean up her mess. My sister-in-law really hasn\u2019t grown in these years. She\u2019s so small-minded with her children.\u201dLin Qi was born noble and Lin Wan had also married into a prestigious family. Even though it was her second marriage, Lin Wan still looked down on Ning Qing.\u201cThen you have misunderstood me. I really want to help.\u201d Lin Qi shook his head and smiled mildly. \u201cBut the little girl has her own good fortune. She had a letter of recommendation, so she entered First Middle School. She doesn\u2019t live at home either, and packed up her bags and left on the second day.\u201d3Lin Wan pursed her lips.Ning Qing\u2019s mood just loosened up at the corner of the stairs when Lin Wan spoke again.She said in a meaningful voice, \u201cHer tactic is\u2026\u201d\u201cSister,\u201d Lin Qi said.Lin Wan shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m reminding you that dogs that bite don\u2019t bark. Can\u2019t you tell your attitude to Jinxuan has already softened?\u201dThe business world was despicable. Lin Qi hadn\u2019t thought about it before, but at this time, he had to admit it.Lin Wan asked Aunt Zhang to refill her glass of water. She took a sip and said gracefully, \u201cI only acknowledge Yu\u2019er as my niece in this family.\u201d\u201cI know you like Yu\u2019er.\u201d Lin Qi smoked a cigarette and lit it himself.The Lin family really liked Qin Yu.The love of this family had always been mixed with benefits. Although Qin Yu was a stepdaughter, she had given pride to her parents.Speaking of Qin Yu, Lin Wan\u2019s complexion was slightly more relaxed. \u201cAfter a while, I will take Yu\u2019er on a trip to the capital. My husband likes the violin, and he has talked about it to Qin Yu several times. Oh, and also, Teacher Wei Lin wants to find an apprentice. I\u2019ll bring Yu\u2019er there to visit next time.\u201d1Lin Qi was stunned before he finally smiled. \u201cYu\u2019er is blessed to have won Old Master\u2019s favor.\u201dAround the corner, Ning Qing stopped for a long while before coming downstairs.When she went downstairs, Lin Wan had a dignified sip of her tea without saying a word.Ning Qing went directly to the hospital to deliver the things.Chen Shulan lived in a separate ward with a nurse.\u201cAunt and Uncle all wanted to come and visit you. Ning Wei is also here in Yun Cheng.\u201d Chen Shulan\u2019s thoughts wandered along the way and her mood wasn\u2019t very good. She pursed her lips. \u201cI booked a hotel. You can come by the day after tomorrow.\u201dA few days ago when Chen Shulan was sick, none of those relatives even asked about her.After knowing that she was in Yun Cheng right now, they were all calling her one by one.Ning Qing was too impatient to deal with these relatives, but she was also afraid that they would go to the Lin family\u2019s villa to find her. If they did that, she would lose face in front of Lin Wan again.**Qin Ran\u2019s payday.Making two meals a day was very simple, and she didn\u2019t even need to wash the bowls. On her payday, the two meals added to less than an hour and she received two hundred a day.In the evening, she went out to eat after cooking.At this moment, she was eating noodles in a stall outside the school.Her eyebrows were delicate as she ate slowly and absentmindedly.Several teenagers shoved and pushed to squeeze into this stall to eat.Not far away, in a Volkswagen car, Lu Zhaoying said slightly, \u201cWait, she\u2019s only eating this?\u201dA bowl of plain noodles with a few green vegetables floating in it.It was bland and tasteless. He saw that the teenagers beside all ordered beef noodles.Lu Zhaoying put his hands on the steering wheel. \u201cDidn\u2019t I just give her money today? Is she on a diet?\u201dCheng Juan looked through the window at Qin Ran.His legs were slightly draped and he was wearing casual pants.\u201cGet down.\u201dLu Zhaoying: \u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry, buy me beef,\u201d Cheng Juan said casually.Lu Zhaoying: \u201c\u2026\u201d Did he feed the dogs the meal that Qin Ran just made?He rubbed his nose and got out of the car to buy a pile of beef for him.He also greeted Qin Ran very coincidentally.Before leaving, he also carefully gave half a plate for her.The black Volkswagen slowly drove away. Inside the car, Lu Zhaoying watched as Qin Ran pinched a piece of beef and ate while leaning against the backrest.Her fingertips were slender and long.\u201cShe\u2019s not on a diet.\u201d Lu Zhaoying was stunned again.Cheng Juan didn\u2019t speak. He just tilted his head slightly and his eyes cleared. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Butler Cheng must be anxious for us.\u201dThey arrived at the villa.Lu Zhaoying stopped the car and put a cigarette in his mouth. Then, the cell phone in his pocket rang. He picked it up and saw that it was a text message.\u201cAh,\u201d Lu Zhaoying said in surprise as he watched Cheng Juan get out of bed slowly. \u201cOur order last night has been returned.\u201d3**First Middle School.Qin Ran supported her chin and was playing a game when several messages popped up.She swiped it away blankly.After a game, she exited.She stood up against the table, bent over and took the headphones inside the table. She buttoned her cap and went to the bathroom.She went inside the last cubicle.She put on the headphones, turned on the voice changer, lowered her voice, and said in a cold and dry voice, \u201cWhich idiot ordered five times the original price? Does he have too much money?\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Suddenly, a girl in a school uniform opened the door.She was shocked.She didn\u2019t expect a person to be sitting on the toilet lid. Her gaze was unrestrained, her expression icily arrogant, and she had her lips curled up heedlessly. Under the dim light from the small window in the cubicle, her face looked extremely delicate.When she saw the door open, she raised an eyebrow at her, ostentatious and sharp.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry!\u201d The girl\u2019s face was a little red. She closed the door and opened another cubicle.1The expression on Qin Ran\u2019s face didn\u2019t change.She had set a price ten times higher than the market price because she didn\u2019t want to accept any order. Never mind that someone had tried to order from her before, but now, some idiot even offered five times her price.She cursed and continued talking in a rush. Even if there were other students in the bathroom, she didn\u2019t know what holding back was.The impatience in her voice could be heard through the voice changer.The person on the other side didn\u2019t dare to say a word.She hung up the phone directly.Qin Ran put the phone back in her pocket, the headphones still hanging on her ears. The black headphone cord dangled from the side of her face, making her face appear whiter.She washed her hands slowly and went out.For self-study in the evening, she went with Lin Siran.Qiao Sheng was just a few steps away, and he even occasionally called Qin Ran and Lin Siran.Xu Yaoguang walked beside him holding two books, looking down the corridor with an indifferent expression.\u201cXu Yaoguang is too cold. He ignores everyone except Qiao Sheng and Qin Yu.\u201d Lin Siran gossiped with Qin Ran.Qin Ran took off her earphones slowly without speaking.Now that self-study was dismissed, there were a lot of people walking outside. Qin Ran had managed to avoid the peak period, so everyone was rushing to leave and there weren\u2019t many people in the corridor now.Qin Yu held a book and waited at the entrance of the stairs.Qin Ran and Lin Siran passed by her. She lowered her voice and said in a volume only the two of them could hear, \u201cGo to En Yu Grand Hotel tomorrow night at 6 o\u2019clock. Mother\u2019s relatives are coming.\u201dShe didn\u2019t make any extra movements but had a feeling of supremacy in her voice.Qin Ran put one hand in her pocket and narrowed her eyes slightly.She didn\u2019t slow down.Qin Yu saw that her expression hadn\u2019t changed much and was even a little cold, so she continued to say, \u201cAunt will go tomorrow too.\u201dAt this moment, Qin Ran reacted. She stuck her hand in her pocket and turned to look at her slightly. She said \u201cokay\u201d lightly.The two talked for less than three seconds and passed by each other.Even Lin Siran didn\u2019t hear the conversation between the two.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Lin Siran heard Qin Yu say to Xu Yaoguang with a smile.Xu Yaoguang also rarely opened his mouth.\u201cQin Yu is really a winner in life,\u201d Lin Siran said emotionally. She whispered to Qin Ran, \u201cHer family members are all geniuses. Her parents and brother adore her, and every year, her birthday is a big deal. In school, Xu Yaoguang is also protecting her. That\u2019s why I told you not to mess with her.\u201dQin Ran raised her eyebrows at her but said nothing.Behind them.Qin Yu was speaking to Xu Yaoguang. Most girls in the school were jealous that she could talk to Xu Yaoguang. While Xu Yaoguang was talking to her, she subconsciously glanced at Qin Ran.Qin Ran did not turn back.Xu Yaoguang held his book in another hand and asked casually, \u201cHave you got any new songs recently?\u201dQin Yu tilted her head and was a little shocked.Then, she pursed her lips and subconsciously remembered the post-it note. She turned away. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cNothing, I\u2019m just asking.\u201d Xu Yaoguang paused.\u201cThere is a new one, how did you know?\u201d Qin Yu smiled.3Xu Yaoguang stopped for two seconds and his eyes relaxed. \u201cThe next time you practice the violin, I\u2019ll go there to watch.\u201d2**In the evening the next day.Qin Ran came out of the school medical room and went to a small road by the school gate to wait for the car.At noon, Ning Qing had called and said that Lin Jinxuan would pick them up on the way.In the evening, the weather wasn\u2019t very hot.Qin Ran looked at the quivering tree on the opposite side. She picked up her phone and looked at the time. It was ten minutes to six.A black car approached the school gate on the left.It was a bit slow.The car passed by her.At the end of the road, it returned.The window of the driver\u2019s seat was lowered and a very handsome face appeared. He touched his ear studs and said, \u201cYou\u2026 Qin Ran, what are you doing here?\u201dLu Zhaoying was the type that talked a lot and was flirtatious. He was friendly to everyone and thought that he was close to Qin Ran.Qin Ran was very impatiently holding her mobile phone. She pressed her finger against her lips and raised her eyebrows. The air pressure around her was low and her face was unpleasant.She was especially cold today.She glanced in the direction of the school road and said nothing.If it had been someone else, Master Lu would have lost his temper.But this was Qin Ran, who was crazy and proud usually. She was ridiculously good looking too, so Lu Zhaoying didn\u2019t lose his temper.Lu Zhaoying still wanted to say something.But the window at the backseat opened.Cheng Juan leaned halfway on the car door and glanced over, looking like an exquisite painting. He said with a chuckle, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cEun Yu.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Cheng Juan nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s on the way, we\u2019ll drop you off.\u201dLu Zhaoying almost bit his tongue. On.. the way?Qin Ran lowered her head. She gathered up her school uniform jacket and got into the car.He moved aside, his long eyelashes drooped.Cheng Juan\u2019s car was clean and didn\u2019t have perfume. He didn\u2019t like perfume.But at that time, he smelled a light, sweet smell.4Cheng Juan leaned quietly against the door.En Yu wasn\u2019t far from the school and would take about 20 minutes by car.Lu Zhaoying\u2019s cell phone rang. He couldn\u2019t find the Bluetooth headset, so he threw the phone behind. \u201cMaster Juan, take it.\u201dCheng Juan leaned against the door and looked at the call slowly. His figure was long and slender, and his long legs had nowhere to rest. He sat in the back seat and looked a little huddled up as his beautiful fingers pressed the phone.Qin Ran didn\u2019t want to eavesdrop on the phone call.It was just that his words were a little familiar.She heard him say in an unhurried and overbearing voice, \u201cSince five times isn\u2019t enough, make it fifty times.\u201dQin Ran frowned.1He hung up.The car stopped and arrived.Qin Ran thanked them and got off.Lu Zhaoying was about to start the car again when in the closed space, the phone rang again.\u201cNot fifty times, make it one hundred times.\u201dLu Zhaoying: \u201c\u2026 Master Juan, that\u2019s not my cell phone.\u201dCheng Juan tilted his head. On the seat beside him was a white mobile phone that didn\u2019t belong to them. It had a caller ID on it, which was a hidden number.Liked it?

She turned around and walked back, leaned slightly, bent her fingers, and knocked casually on the window.Raising his eyebrows, Cheng Juan reached out and lowered the window.She lowered her eyes half-heartedly and indifferently and was quite apologetic. \u201cI dropped my phone.\u201dCheng Juan looked down, picked up the phone, and handed it to her. His fingers were long and beautiful, and his voice was dull. \u201cI know, your phone is ringing.\u201d2Qin Ran took the phone, her expression still the same, and said casually, \u201cIt\u2019s for promotion.\u201dEver since the software for undisclosed numbers was developed, there were indeed many undisclosed numbers now.Entering the hotel, Qin Ran lowered her head and sent a message to Ning Qing.The undisclosed number called again.She walked to the end of the corridor without changing her expression, took out the earphones in her pocket, turned on the microphone, and connected the phone.\u201cThe other party raised the amount. Fifty times.\u201d The voice was obviously processed, and there was a slight current. \u201cDo you want to come out of seclusion?\u201dQin Ran: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe leaned against the wall and didn\u2019t speak for a while.After a long while.Qin Ran said, \u201cWho is that idiot?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d The person on the other end of the phone was shocked.\u201cI asked, which fool ordered me. Give me his details.\u201d Qin Ran smirked and coiled the earphone cable around her fingertips.Hearing Qin Ran\u2019s relaxed attitude, the person on the phone hung up happily.It didn\u2019t take long for the specific details to be sent to Qin Ran\u2019s mailbox.Not walking away, Qin Ran changed her posture, leaned back against the wall, and opened the data unhurriedly.As she looked at the messages, her veins jumped again.2She texted back one word\u2014[Okay.]Simple and crisp.**Hearing that Lin Jinxuan was about to arrive, Ning Qing waited downstairs for a long time.In the evening, the Lin family\u2019s driver had picked her up and didn\u2019t have time to go pick up Qin Yu. Since Lin Jinxuan was passing by, he helped to pick up Qin Yu and Qin Ran.Ning Qing was somewhat flattered.Lin Jinxuan had always been cold to her all these years, but once Qin Yu was involved, he was much better to get along with.Since her stepson was fetching her daughter, she naturally had to wait downstairs.\u201cJinxuan, we really troubled you.\u201d Ning Qing smiled slightly. Carrying a bag, she had a calm elegance on her beautiful face.Getting out of the car, Lin Jinxuan\u2019s eyes were very light and he was very handsome and gentle. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dLin Jinxuan was very busy lately, and even at home, he was always on the phone.He looked extremely worried as if something had happened, so Ning Qing and Lin Qi didn\u2019t bother him much.Now that he was here, Lin Jinxuan also didn\u2019t talk much. He was very polite and greeted Ning Qing the moment he got off the car.Ning Qing watched Qin Yu get down from the car.The door in the back seat never opened.Right now, Lin Jinxuan was about to drive away.She glanced at the backseat. \u201cJinxuan, where is Qin Ran? Didn\u2019t she come along?\u201dLin Jinxuan already had his hands on the key. Hearing this sentence, he was silent for several seconds before raising his head, pressing his temples and say in a stunned voice, \u201cSorry, I was too busy and forgot about her. Do you know her phone number? I\u2019ll go pick her up now.\u201d2It turned out she had been forgotten.Ning Qing nodded. Her fingers moved, but her tone was mild and gentle. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, I\u2019ll let her take a taxi by herself. You\u2019re so busy recently, you don\u2019t need to pick her up.\u201dLin Jinxuan was indeed not such a gentleman, and he was also very busy. \u201cGive me her phone number later and I\u2019ll apologize to her.\u201dOnce Lin Jinxuan left, Ning Qing pressed her temples and pulled out her cell phone to call Qin Ran.She didn\u2019t pick up.\u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t think of it\u2026\u201d Qin Yu walked into the venue and handed her violin to Aunt Zhang apologetically.Ning Qing hung up a little impatiently since Qin Ran wasn\u2019t answering. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It has nothing to do with you.\u201dShe called twice in a row again, but Qin Ran still didn\u2019t answer. At first, she was angry, but when she thought of the process, she felt a little uncomfortable.If it had been Qin Yu, Lin Jinxuan would definitely have gone back to pick her up.Even if she didn\u2019t have time, Ning Qing would have gone to pick her up personally and wouldn\u2019t have just glossed over it.In the end, it was because she was Qin Ran, not Qin Yu.She hadn\u2019t gotten along with Qin Ran for twelve years now and had already drifted away. Especially since Qin Ran had a stiff temper and was so cold and proud. She was so hard and didn\u2019t say nice stuff like Qin Yu did.So many relatives had come to Yun Cheng just to see how well Ning Qing was doing.They weren\u2019t actually there to see Chen Shulan, they just wanted to better their relationships with Ning Qing.Ning Qing knew what the relatives were thinking. She looked down on them but didn\u2019t want to disgrace herself either.On such an occasion, Qin Ran could be absent, but Qin Yu couldn\u2019t. Qin Yu was the reason for her proud existence.COMMENTAs for Qin Ran\u2026There were no secrets between this group of relatives. If they asked about why Qin Ran was still in her senior year\u2026Ning Qing sighed. She shoved her phone back into her pocket and took Qin Yu up the stairs.After a while, the group of relatives was almost all there.Chen Shulan bowed her head and watched as Ning Qing was surrounded by everyone. She then asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Ran Ran, why isn\u2019t she here?\u201dNing Qing paused. Out of the corner of her eyes, she happened to see a thin figure coming in.The person was loosely dressed in a First Middle School\u2019s uniform jacket and wore a white T-shirt inside. The private room was dark and noisy. Everyone was extravagant, and she was the only one frowning.\u201cIsn\u2019t she here?\u201d Ning Qing said.Chen Shulan saw her too.Qin Ran was dazzling wherever she went. Her raised eyebrows were sharp and straight, and everyone noticed her presence when she entered the room.\u201cGrandma, where\u2019s Aunt?\u201d Qin Ran took Chen Shulan\u2019s left hand and asked. She looked around the room and finally saw Ning Wei standing at a corner helplessly.\u201cBig niece, really, I haven\u2019t seen you for many years. You are getting younger and younger.\u201d A middle-aged woman held Ning Qing\u2019s hand affectionately. \u201cOh, this must be Qin Yu. She is so pretty. I heard that she even played the violin on TV. How proud you must be\u2026\u201dQin Ran heard Ning Qing\u2019s reserved and joyful voice. \u201cCome, Yu\u2019er, this is my brother\u2019s wife. She doesn\u2019t need me to worry about her since young. Now, she\u2019s in First Middle School\u2019s first class\u2026\u201dQin Ran had never seen these relatives before and basically didn\u2019t know them.She also knew that these relatives had come for Ning Qing and Qin Yu, so she was too lazy and indifferent to interact with them as well.Excusing herself to Chen Shulan, she went to find Ning Wei.Ning Wei stood in a corner pinching the corner of her clothes helplessly; her clothes were clean but obviously old.\u201cRan Ran.\u201d Her eyes lit up at the sight of Qin Ran, and her voice raised slightly.Qin Ran paused for a while. She then held her cell phone and inhaled. \u201cAunt, why aren\u2019t you sitting down?\u201d\u201cThere are no stools. I can just stand.\u201d Ning Wei laughed, then stared at the equally restrained girl beside her. \u201cMu Ying, this is your cousin, Ran Ran.\u201d1Before Mu Ying spoke, she saw Qin Ran move.Qin Ran didn\u2019t say anything and just glanced around.Her gaze was unspeakable cold.Cold and dry.There was a stool not far away with a violin placed on it.She seemed to sigh with an irritable and very angry expression on her face, then squeezed her fingers and walked over.Before her slender fingers touched the violin, a sharp voice exploded beside her. \u201cThis violin is worth 580,000. Ms. Qin, don\u2019t touch it!\u201d1Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She walked a few steps towards her, her voice so sharp that everyone looked over.Ning Wei knew Qin Ran wanted to get her a chair.But Aunt Zhang\u2019s gaze was strange. It seemed to send daggers into her, making her feel extremely uncomfortable. Ning Wei pursed her lips and tried to ignore her.There were sounds of inhalation around them.The other relatives were envious and surprised.No one found this unreasonable.Everyone thought it seemed only obvious.\u201cMy goodness, 580,000? You can pay for the down payment for a house in Yun Cheng with that money!\u201d\u201cIt can probably buy two houses in our town, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNing Wei clenched her hands tightly. She took a few steps forward and whispered a little urgently, \u201cRan Ran, I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201dQin Ran looked up.Then, she laughed and smirked in a cold and bad manner. \u201c580,000? That\u2019s such a large amount of money.\u201dShe looked sideways at Aunt Zhang, Ning Qing, and Qin Yu.The light in the box was dim and it hit her face, making her eyes seem even redder. It was narrowed slightly, dauntless and arrogant as if she was about to break through the horizon.Her expression was proud, her smile mocking, and her eyes evil.\u201cQin Ran, you\u2026\u201d Ning Qing opened her mouth.She had called her Ran Ran before, but now, she called her Qin Ran.\u201cWhat?\u201d Qin Ran paused before slowly reaching out to take the violin. She weighed it in her hands before casually putting it on a table.She turned, a little irritable and astringent, and kicked the chair to Ning Wei.\u201cAunt, you can sit,\u201d she said.The whole room was very quiet. It was weirdly quiet and everyone\u2019s eyes were on this side.Ning Wei\u2019s body stiffened, feeling a little uneasy. \u201cThat violin\u2026\u201dAunt Zhang reacted at this time. \u201cThat\u2019s Miss\u2019 violin!\u201d\u201cWho cares about the violin? She\u2019s here to eat, why did she bring a violin?\u201d Qin Ran licked her lips and smiled. Her eyes seemed redder and, under the not-too-bright light, her eyebrows were drenched in evil spirits. \u201cYou\u2019re so annoying. I\u2019ll pay you a hundred violins if it breaks!\u201d3Qin Ran thought that she had been quite repressed.It was this Ning Qing and the Qin\u2019s family nanny that was too petty.Standing at the tip of the pyramid every day to watch people, were they not tired?No one spoke in the box.The group of relatives remained silent.Qin Ran raised her chin and her eyes narrowed slightly. When she saw the waiter passing by the door, she leaned on the table, raised her chin, and snapped her fingers sharply. \u201cCome, serve!\u201dAfter dinner, Qin Ran took Ning Wei and Chen Shulan and left first while Ning Qing was still dealing with the relatives.The relatives had originally come for Ning Qing. They weren\u2019t here to see Chen Shulan, so it was to their favor.In the room, after Qin Ran left, the atmosphere became active.Qin Yu smiled, raised her glass, and was extremely elegant. \u201cI apologize for my sister.\u201dThis group of relatives was also a group of elites. They were also clear about Ning Qing not wanting Qin Ran back then.\u201cYour sister is just like that.\u201d Her aunt immediately waved her hand in disregard and pursed her lips. \u201cAt the age of sixteen, she dared to hit someone\u2019s head! I heard that he was sent to the emergency room and the police had to come quickly.\u201dQin Ran fought very well and her fights were a common occurrence. Last time, they often saw Qin Ran being injured.She didn\u2019t do that anymore, but she was still fierce and vicious, which was why this group of relatives were a little afraid of her.Speaking of this, Ning Qing\u2019s face turned black.Nobody told her about the police.\u201cBig niece, this Aunt Zhang\u2026\u201d The aunt saw her expression and immediately turned to the topic while smiling charmingly.\u201cThis is Aunt Zhang. She\u2019s in charge of the Lin family\u2019s daily life.\u201d Ning Qing took a piece of tissue and wiped the corners of her mouth.The expressions of the group of relatives watching Ning Qing and Qin Yu changed. \u201cYou see just how good this family is. They event have servants\u2026\u201dQin Yu went out to the bathroom and Aunt Zhang immediately followed her.Her tone was mocking as she said, \u201cMiss, don\u2019t show your violin to Ms. Qin in the future. When she eventually breaks it, you will be the one distressed. She even said she would give you a hundred more. Can she even afford one?\u201dQin Yu bowed her head and washed her hands. She smiled when she heard it.4**\u201cMom, Aunt and Qin Yu are still\u2026\u201d Mu Ying glanced back at the box, hesitant about leaving.Ning Wei shook her head. Qin Yu and Ning Qing obviously didn\u2019t want to have a relationship with them, but the child still didn\u2019t understand. \u201cDon\u2019t think about it, let\u2019s go home.\u201dShe walked slowly, her footsteps sluggish.Qin Ran followed behind them with her hands around her chest.They first took Chen Shulan to the hospital and spoke with her for a while.Mu Ying kept looking at the facilities of the ward.After leaving the ward, Qin Ran looked back.\u201cRan Ran, tonight\u2026\u201d Ning Wei opened her mouth.\u201cWhat was wrong with me tonight? Is Ning Qing a fool?\u201d Under the lantern, the girl\u2019s gaze was fierce and cold. She sneered. \u201cDoes she even know that you injured your leg when you dropped out of school to earn money for her school fees?!\u201d5Ning Wei was silent.Qin Ran rubbed her temple and her voice softened. \u201cAunt, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not angry at you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not angry, I know you\u2019re doing it for me. But Ran Ran, your mother isn\u2019t wrong. Your uncle\u2019s hospitalization matters were all handled by her. Ran Ran, your mother doesn\u2019t owe me.\u201d Ning Wei smiled. She reached out and touched Qin Ran\u2019s head, her eyes softening. \u201cAlso, I don\u2019t want you to have a bad relationship with your mother. After all, you are mother and daughter.\u201d1Under the light, Qin Ran\u2019s eyebrows were cold.Her mother now wanted so badly to sever ties with this group of relatives, and she didn\u2019t even want her daughter anymore. She was afraid that the group of relatives would go to the Lin family to make trouble.She didn\u2019t want to tell Aunt about these.COMMENT\u201cMu Ying and Mu Nan are coming to First Middle School, right?\u201d Qin Ran took out two thousand yuan from her pocket and handed them to Ning Wei. \u201cYou hold it first. When Mu Ying and Mu Nan go to high school, they can\u2019t just learn casually. Don\u2019t let Mu Nan work. This is the money I earned myself, not from my mother.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want the money, you keep it, or I\u2019ll buy you two sets of clothes.\u201d Ning Wei\u2019s eyes fell on Qin Ran\u2019s clothes.Qin Ran rubbed her teeth. This Aunt was really capable of doing that.She had transferred 100,000 to her aunt\u2019s account back then.Now her aunt\u2019s account was almost 110,000.Not a dime had been spent.Aunt must be keeping it to use as her dowry.Qin Ran said nothing and put the money back in her pocket. Two days later when it was the holidays, she would go to her aunt\u2019s rental house to take a look. She could use the money to install an air conditioner, which Ning Wei definitely wouldn\u2019t bear to.\u201cRight, aunt, are you finished with the medicine?\u201d Qin Ran remembered another thing.She felt around in her pants pocket.Then, she took out the white pill bottle that Gu Xichi had given her and passed it to Ning Wei.At this time, Ning Qing hurried over. The driver of the Lin family had probably sent Qin Yu back since it was Lin Jinxuan who accompanied Ning Qing over.\u201cIs Mom asleep? What are you talking about?\u201d Ning Qing took a breath and asked.Mu Ying immediately rushed to speak, \u201cAuntie, grandma is asleep. Cousin is giving my mother medicine.\u201dNing Qing frowned. Everything that had happened at night had made her lose her face. In front of her stepson, she deliberately put up with her temper.But Qin Ran frowned, tilted her head and sneered. It was disdainful, mocking, and arrogant.Ning Qing seemed to have been triggered, like a balloon that had been pierced and exploded.Her volume was high. \u201cQin Ran, are you still like your grandfather, doing drugs every day? Your grandfather already killed himself. Forget about it if you crazy people want to harm yourself, but now you want to harm your aunt?\u201dMu Ying and Lin Jinxuan had never heard of these things. They were stunned.\u201cThat\u2019s the medicine that the country has put into experiments,\u201d Qin Ran looked up and said word for word. \u201cI am not crazy.\u201dAt this moment, even Ning Qing looked up a little hesitantly and stared at Qin Ran.Liked it?

She was slightly taller than Ning Qing, so she lowered her head slightly, her eyes cold. \u201cAm I very close to you?\u201dNing Qing found her voice. She pinched her fingers and her joints protruded out. \u201cI also have my mistakes in this matter, but I only did it for you. Don\u2019t follow your grandfather\u2019s footsteps. You\u2019re still in First Middle School, who will care about you other than me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need your control.\u201d Qin Ran turned away. She narrowed her bloodshot eyes and raised her wild and dauntless eyebrows, then reached out to pat Ning Qing\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOther than my grandmother, nobody can control me. So, whether I live or die, attend whatever school, get admitted to a university or not, it\u2019s none of your business, okay?\u201d She smiled.She said it word by word in an unhurried fashion.After speaking, she turned and raised an eyebrow at Ning Wei and Mu Ying. The two immediately followed her.Ning Wei was also so anxious that she didn\u2019t bid farewell to Ning Qing.Outside the gate of the hospital, Ning Qing\u2019s face delicate makeup filled was ashen for a while, and even her fingertips were shaking.Lin Jinxuan stood on the side and glanced in Qin Ran\u2019s direction.Just like the first time he had seen them, his eyes were dark and cold.His strength of character was intense.He had finished his business and had come to pick up Ning Qing as well as apologize to Qin Ran on the way. Qin Yu had urged him to leave quickly at night and he was also busy, so he had forgotten about Qin Ran.\u201cAunt Ning, you still have to see Grandma Chen. I have matters to attend to, so I won\u2019t go up.\u201d Lin Jinxuan smiled and paused. \u201cIt stands to reason that I shouldn\u2019t care about your family affairs, but ultimately, it\u2019s not good to criticize your daughter like that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d3Without waiting for Ning Qing to answer, he nodded slightly towards her and turned around with his mobile phone.Lin Jinxuan opened the car door and got in.When he put his hands on the steering wheel, he shuddered slightly and pointed his long fingertips on the steering wheel.His eyes narrowed.He didn\u2019t forget what Qin Ran had just said\u2014the medicine that the state put into the laboratory. What did that mean?On the surface, it seemed to be a drug that had not yet been issued and the quantity was limited.Not many people could get it, then.He had checked Ning Qing\u2019s details twelve years ago when she married his father, and there were no particular details that had caught his attention. Hence, he hadn\u2019t cared much about the marriage.Thinking about it, he saw Qin Ran waiting with Ning Wei at the bus stop.Lin Jinxuan stopped and lowered the window.His brow was born with indifference and loftiness, but his tone was gentle. \u201cQin Ran, where are you guys going? I can send you all as atonement.\u201dHis car was a black Maybach.His left hand rested on the steering wheel, and his slightly exposed wrist was wearing a Bulgari watch.Even his face was expensive.6Mu Ying couldn\u2019t see the brand, but she could distinguish the nobleness of it. She had never been in such a car.1Subconsciously, Mu Ying glanced at Qin Ran.\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Qin Ran lowered her head and played with her phone.She sat on the stool at the bus stop with her legs propped up casually.She didn\u2019t even raise her head.Lin Jinxuan had experienced Qin Ran\u2019s indifference and lack of regard before.\u201cOkay. You, three ladies, be careful then, and send me a text message when you reach school,\u201d he said politely.Qin Ran didn\u2019t speak.Qin Ran ignored him.Still playing games.Very indifferent.\u201cPay attention to safety.\u201d Lin Jinxuan looked at the big boss with her legs propped up and laughed silently. He thought for a moment before driving off.When Lin Jinxuan was gone, Mu Ying was curious for a long time before she said, \u201cCousin, was that your friend?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s part of the Lin family.\u201d Qin Ran continued to play her game, her voice calm.The Lin family?The super-rich Lin family that Ning Qing had married into?Mu Ying thought, Is that the master of the Lin family?On the 12th road, Mu Ying said, \u201cCousin, First Middle School\u2019s car is here. I\u2019ll send you there with mum first. You\u2019re a girl\u2026\u201d\u201cWait for 623, I\u2019ll send you off first,\u201d Qin Ran said casually.**Ning Qing stood at the entrance of the hospital. It was night and there were not many people coming and going.But she still felt embarrassed.After being blocked by Qin Ran, and then being preached by her stepson, she felt as though everyone was watching her. She bit her lip and lowered her head into the hospital quickly.Because she walked fast, she didn\u2019t notice that when she went up to the elevator, nobody was there.It was only nine o\u2019clock now.Although there were few people in the hospital at night, this floor was full of patients, family members of patients, doctors and nurses.After getting off the elevator, Ning Qing found something very wrong.It shouldn\u2019t be so quiet, there was almost no sound.Her pores almost exploded.2There seemed to be something ahead, so Ning Qing looked up sharply.The first thing she saw was a man holding a mobile phone and looking at her with a smile on his face.The other side\u2019s coldness almost struck her.Ning Qing\u2019s gaze fell onto a man with a black figure.He was leaning against the wall, one hand in his pocket and the other playing with a thin scalpel. His fingers were white and clear under the light, and his joints were smooth and beautiful.The scalpel turned slowly in his hand.His face was lowered, but she could still see his beautiful features.Even though it was a strange occasion, Ning Qing was still stunned by him.No matter how dull she was, she also knew something was wrong.Ning Qing took a step back. She reached out, took out the mobile phone in her bag, and said cautiously, \u201cWho are you? What are you doing here?\u201dBefore she could do anything else, Lu Zhaoying pulled her phone away.Lu Zhaoying touched his earrings, turning the mobile phone around at his fingertips. He bent down halfway, took the mobile phone and patted Ning Qing\u2019s face.He tilted his head and smiled indifferently and relentlessly. \u201cMaster Juan, she\u2019s asking us a question.\u201d3A few steps away, the guy playing with the scalpel stopped suddenly.Ning Qing did not dare to move and it felt like her heart had been caught onto something.The veins on her clenched fingers were almost exposed.This was the best hospital in Yun Cheng, so they shouldn\u2019t be here at this time.Not to mention that this was a VIP ward.With 24-hour security monitoring.To be able to clear the area at this time and have the hospital cooperate as well\u2026 Ning Qing didn\u2019t know just when she had offended such a big person.When she had married into the Lin family, she had always been cautious and afraid of making mistakes.When Ning Qing was panicking.Cheng Juan looked up, his face still handsome, his eyes clear and narrowed.She seemed to have never seen such a person in Yun Cheng.Ning Qing\u2019s fingers trembled violently, and the other party didn\u2019t even need to do anything. Just one glance over at her made it hard to breathe.As soon as the sentence came to an end, Lu Zhaoying sniggered.Cheng Juan looked down. After a while, he threw the scalpel to Lu Zhaoying and took out a cigarette from his pocket.Under the corridor lights, he was slender and his eyes were delicate.He still looked at Ning Qing and smiled. His voice was light, slow, and with an unknown ruthlessness. \u201cWho did you call crazy just now?\u201dLiked it?

Wasn\u2019t this Qin Ran\u2019s friend? She knew that Qin Ran\u2019s friends were mostly shady.But they were really quite scary.\u201cI\u2026\u201d She said, seemingly not so afraid anymore.But she was still tense because of the scalpel dangling in front of her.\u201cRemember to say sorry to her.\u201d Cheng Juan looked down.2Coincidentally, the elevator rang.Ning Qing\u2019s eyes glowed.She turned back sharply.She watched as the elevator door opened. The dean and director were standing inside.\u201cDean Jiang, you are here!\u201d She turned around in a hurry as if she had found her savior.But what she didn\u2019t expect was that the dean didn\u2019t even look at her. He just looked at Cheng Juan and said politely, \u201cMaster Juan, are you busy? Everyone is waiting\u2026\u201dThe blood on Ning Qing\u2019s body coagulated.Cheng Juan shook his head and his phone rang. He didn\u2019t look at the phone and his eyes were heavy.He looked at Ning Qing and repeated, \u201cRemember my words.\u201dHis tone was extremely icy.Ning Qing didn\u2019t dare to say something now and nodded quickly.\u201cOkay.\u201d Cheng Juan retracted his gaze, and even the smile on his face faded.He thought of Ning Qing\u2019s high-end custom-made clothes. Although the bag she was holding was not a limited edition, it was also tens of thousands. Not to mention the bracelet inlaid with diamonds on her wrist.It was probably one million and above.He then thought of Qin Ran\u2019s clothes again. They were clean, but they also looked old and average.Cheng Juan really didn\u2019t believe that the woman in front of him was really Qin Ran\u2019s mother.\u201cIf I hear you say those three words to her again, do you understand the consequences?\u201d Cheng Juan lit a cigarette and smiled at her.Usually, he was very easygoing, but once he was serious, his beautiful peach blossom eyes were sharp and vicious.The entire corridor was shrouded in the low pressure of Master Juan, and even the dean didn\u2019t dare to interrupt.Ning Qing didn\u2019t know who Cheng Juan was, but she also knew that Cheng Juan wasn\u2019t easy to mess with. At this time, she couldn\u2019t even speak, so she just nodded.Lu Zhaoying retracted the knife, moved sideways and raised his chin towards her. \u201cGet out.\u201dNing Qing didn\u2019t even dare to look back. She panted and trotted directly to Chen Shulan\u2019s ward.Her footsteps were unsteady as if she was fleeing.Lu Zhaoying snorted. \u201cLook at how scared she is of you.\u201dCheng Juan glanced at him and raised his eyebrows. He was calm and composed as he asked, \u201cDid I scare her?\u201d1Lu Zhaoying: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster Juan, the meeting room\u2026\u201d The dean looked at Cheng Juan. He didn\u2019t ask what was going on and only asked him.His eyes were expectant.Master Juan wasn\u2019t interested, however, and said casually, \u201cLet Lu Zhaoying explain the specific arrangements to you. I will go back first.\u201dToday was Cheng Juan\u2019s operation day that happened once a month. The other party was a rich man. After hearing that Cheng Juan wasn\u2019t in Beijing, he had quickly arranged the hospital in Yun Cheng.1Cheng Juan had come to discuss the operation arrangements and plans but didn\u2019t expect to meet Qin Ran again.Lu Zhaoying was pondering about Ning Qing, and when he heard that, he pointed to his nose in disbelief. \u201cYou want me to talk?\u201dCheng Juan flanked his side and bit a cigarette. His face was full of mist as he smirked. \u201cWhat about it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see.\u201d Lu Zhaoying was a little hesitant.Cheng Juan didn\u2019t talk anymore. He reached out, pressed the elevator button, and went directly to the underground garage.He still drove the black Volkswagen today.Passing by the bus platform, the girl sitting on the temporary seat of the platform was playing a game. Her legs were propped up and she looked like a hooligan. She was probably waiting for the bus.He stopped the car and asked, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dHis voice was dull and somewhat indolent.Hearing the sound, Mu Ying first looked up.The window lowered and she looked over. His good-looking face appeared, rendering Mu Ying speechless as she stood there stupidly.1Qin Ran also heard his voice.She finally looked up from her phone. Since the bus wasn\u2019t here yet, she thought about it and asked for Ning Wei\u2019s address first before repeating it to Cheng Juan.\u201cGet in.\u201d He laid his finger on the steering wheel.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Ning Wei was a little hesitant and didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cGet in the car first.\u201d Qin Ran didn\u2019t know how long it would take for the bus to come. After opening the door, Ning Wei entered.Mu Ying watched as Qin Ran entered the front passenger seat and even handed them two mints without asking. She knew this was Qin Ran\u2019s friend.She sat a little slumped against the window of the car.She knew this car was a Volkswagen.Ning Wei lived in an old alley. There were no lights and it was very dark. The car couldn\u2019t even go in.Qin Ran came down to accompany them.Cheng Juan\u2019s car was parked in the alley.\u201cCousin, was that your friend just now?\u201d Mu Ying couldn\u2019t help asking.\u201cI guess so. I\u2019m working for him.\u201d Qin Ran put her hand in her pocket.Nothing more was said. Mu Ying opened her mouth and finally turned to the topic. \u201cCousin, I\u2019ll go to First Middle School with Mu Nan in a few days.\u201dQin Ran nodded. Mu Ying was three years younger than her. She and Mu Nan were fraternal twins, and both had very good results.They were attending First Middle School this year.The quality of middle schools in Ninghai Village was really not good. Otherwise, Ning Wei wouldn\u2019t have taken them to Yun Cheng.First Middle School\u2019s first-grade building had just been completed, so this year\u2019s freshmen would start school later than before. They would start on September 15th, and there were still several days till then.\u201cHow is it in First Middle School?\u201d Mu Ying looked at Qin Ran and asked with some anticipation. \u201cSecond cousin is also in the school, right? I heard mum say that she\u2019s top five and plans to go to Peking University.\u201dAlthough Mu Ying had excellent grades in Ninghai Village, she had never thought about entering Peking University. It was more probable for Mu Nan.\u201cAll schools are the same,\u201d Qin Ran waved her hand and said vaguely. \u201cYou will know when you go. Aunt, I\u2019m heading back.\u201d\u201cLook out for your safety.\u201d Ning Wei didn\u2019t let Qin Ran enter the house either. They had only arrived today and their things were still messy.If Qin Ran entered, she would surely stay behind to help them clean up.When Qin Ran left, Mu Ying looked back at the direction the car was leaving and couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cMom, how does big cousin know so many friends? It seems that they are all rich.\u201d1To her, having a car meant you were rich.2Dad was in a vegetative state and there were a lot of daily care fees. Only her mother was working to make ends meet.Forget about a car, it was difficult for them to buy even clothes.Mu Ying and Qin Ran hadn\u2019t seen each other for more than a year, but she remembered that from an early age, only Qin Ran and her grandmother would buy her and her brother candies. They didn\u2019t look down on them like the rest of the family did.\u201cYour cousin\u2019s friends are all handsome,\u201d Ning Wei thought about it and said.1Mu Ying didn\u2019t talk anymore. Thinking about finally coming to Yun Cheng and going to First Middle School, she was excited. \u201cMom, our clothes are too small now. Can we buy new clothes?\u201dNing Wei paused, then smiled. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take you shopping tomorrow.\u201dMu Nan heard them arriving and opened the door to let them in.The Ning family weren\u2019t born ugly. Hence, Ning Wei\u2019s children were also as such. Mu Nan had a handsome face and was better looking than Mu Ying.Just that his face was cold.Upon hearing this, he said coldly, \u201cNo, you can buy it for Mu Ying. My clothes aren\u2019t small.\u201dNing Wei looked at his exposed ankle and frowned. \u201cMu Nan\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it. I\u2019m going to study.\u201d Mu Nan turned back to his room and closed the door.1Ning Wei looked around. All the things in the house had been packed by Mu Nan.\u201cMom, why didn\u2019t you accept aunt\u2019s money today?\u201d Mu Ying went to see her room with Ning Wei.Ning Wei shook her head. \u201cYour aunt is rich, but people should help the starving and not the poor. She\u2019s not obliged to help share our burdens. Besides, when your dad had a car accident, he would have passed on if it weren\u2019t for your aunt. How could I ask her for money? Ying Ying, remember, aunt has money, but it belongs to the Lin family. It\u2019s not easy being a stepmother, so you must refuse anything she gives you, okay?\u201dMu Ying pursed her lips. \u201cOkay.\u201dNing Wei sighed.She tidied the remaining things.Mu Ying helped her organize the things and was anxious to start school immediately. \u201cI heard that First Middle School\u2019s campus belle is second cousin. She plays the violin so well. Everyone outside of school knows that First Middle School has a campus king too. I think his surname is Xu, and he knows second cousin too\u2026\u201dOne of her classmates\u2019 older sister was in First Middle School. During the summer vacation, she had heard her classmates talking and had even seen pictures of the school, so she knew how beautiful it was.**Qin Ran walked back.She realized that Cheng Juan had been following them not far away.When she came back, he turned away and snuffed his cigarette.Qin Ran opened the door of the back seat. Cheng Juan glanced at her out of the corner of his eyes. He looked away and turned the key.He didn\u2019t drive back to school first but instead went to the hospital to pick up Lu Zhaoying.Lu Zhaoying first laid on the back of the front passenger seat and watched Qin Ran playing a game for a while, then he scratched his head. \u201cSis\u2026 Qin Ran, why are you short of money?\u201dQin Ran didn\u2019t want to answer him, so she looked up at him and raised her eyebrows indifferently.Lu Zhaoying was terrified for a second. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to answer me, you really don\u2019t.\u201dWhile turning his head, he took out his mobile phone and prepared to play the game played by Qin Ran. He just opened the game when he saw a message he just received at the top of his mobile phone screen.His eyes widened and his volume rose. \u201cThis bitch! Master Juan\u2026 that man\u2026 that big shot, he has taken our order!\u201d\u201cScreech\u2014\u201dA harsh rubbing noise sounded.The car stopped suddenly.Liked it?

I\u2019m a little unaccustomed, aren\u2019t they\u2026\u201d Lu Zhaoying wanted to say something, but he glanced at Qin Ran out of the corner of his eyes and suddenly stopped and looked around. \u201cOh, look at how pretty the moon is today, hahahaha\u2026\u201d7Qin Ran continued to look down at her mobile phone calmly.She didn\u2019t say anything, her expressions didn\u2019t change, and it was as if he hadn\u2019t heard anything. Lu Zhaoying was relieved and glanced at Cheng Juan.1Cheng Juan slightly tilted his head and the street lights outside the car blurred his outline so that his expression couldn\u2019t be seen. However, the hand that was holding onto the steering wheel wasn\u2019t calm.It took several minutes for Cheng Juan to start the car again.On the way back to school, Lu Zhaoying didn\u2019t say anything. He just sat on the co-pilot restlessly, looking around, touching his cell phone for a while, then pulling the seat belt again. It was obvious that he was impatient.After arriving at school, Lu Zhaoying didn\u2019t say that he would send Qin Ran back.When Qin Ran returned, it was close to ten o\u2019clock, and self-study was in a while later.1The dormitory door opened.Qin Ran went back and took a bath first.When she had brushed her hair and went out, Lin Siran had come back with a few books.There was also a girl behind her. The girl had short hair, black-rimmed glasses on the bridge of her nose, and her skin was very white. The eyes behind the lenses were large, black and shiny, and her head was lowered. She was very quiet, obedient, and beautiful. At first glance, she looked like a good student.Qin Ran glanced at her, then lowered her head and continued to wipe her hair.4She was wearing large short-sleeved pajamas, and the red ropes on her wrists were even more noticeable, making her complexion whiter and more delicate.\u201cQin Ran, you\u2019re back.\u201d Lin Siran drew two papers on the table and handed them to the girl. \u201cPan Mingyue.\u201dPan Mingyue seemed to be thinking of something.Hearing the sound, she immediately turned around and took the paper. \u201cThank you.\u201dLin Siran smiled and said that it was nothing. She took her water bottle to the laundry room and went out with Pan Mingyue.\u201cThat girl is my deskmate. She looks good, doesn\u2019t she?\u201dPan Mingyue kept listening quietly. When she was about to go to her dormitory, she paused and took out a lollipop from her pocket. \u201cLin Siran, can you bring this to your deskmate?\u201dLin Siran held her bottle in her other hand.She took the lollipop and tilted her head. \u201cMy deskmate is such a cool person, would she eat this?\u201dPan Mingyue pursed her lips and seemed to laugh. She said, \u201cYes.\u201dAt night.Lin Siran woke up to go to the toilet drowsily and saw a few rays of light through the gap of Qin Ran\u2019s bed curtain.On the bed.Qin Ran put down the book on the bedside, took off her backpack from the hook, and poured out the contents inside.She took out the black cell phone and opened it.The page still showed the red dots in the school medical office.\u201cDon\u2019t think about it, I\u2019ve searched and didn\u2019t see any obvious traces,\u201d she said casually.Throwing the phone aside, she pulled the computer over while sitting cross-legged and lazily turned it on.Her fingers typed lines of code on the keyboard.The red dot was stubbornly lit on the side of the phone. After a few minutes, the red dot disappeared and the page reluctantly became the normal home page of the phone.**The next day.In the morning, there were four lessons. English, Chinese, Mathematics, and Physics. Everyone was drowsy and had a headache.After the fourth class, Xu Yaoguang took the Physics paper from the office. He happened to see the English paper that Wu Yan had done two nights ago.Wu Yan was from Qin Ran\u2019s dormitory, and she was the English class representative.\u201cMr. Gao, I\u2019ve already told you that this student is a troublemaker. Look at her test paper, you can\u2019t find anyone else who scored a zero for their papers. Do you know that your average English score is three points lower than the grade average?\u201d Li Airong chuckled. Her scornfulness was difficult to conceal. She had already said long ago that it would be too difficult to expect to influence Qin Ran.The average English score in class 3.9 was three points lower than the average grade, and two points less than the average English score in the worst class.She thanked herself for her persistence in the presence of President Xu.Gao Yang pushed down his glasses, still smiling, without sadness or joy. \u201cChildren of this age are indeed rebellious, so we have to teach them the correct values.\u201d\u201cJust keep pretending.\u201d Li Airong handed the paper to Wu Yan.Xu Yaoguang knocked on the door. \u201cI\u2019m here for the Physics paper.\u201dSeeing him, Li Airong took back the sternness on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s classmate Xu. Your English is still the highest score in the school this time, 136 points.\u201dWhat they did was a series of ten papers produced by the ten schools themselves, which was very difficult. It was also said that students who had just entered the third year of high school shouldn\u2019t be lax. First Middle School\u2019s average score was 69.The first place scored 136, the second place 129, and the third place scored only 117 points.Xu Yaoguang said hello and took out the new paper.Wu Yan walked slowly.Xu Yaoguang paused as she passed by.Li Airong especially pulled out Qin Ran\u2019s paper and put it on the top. The \u201c0\u201d she drew was a little rough and very conspicuous.He saw it at a glance.English multiple choice questions occupied 115 points, which was a very high score.She had done the answer card.Even if she stepped on it with her feet, shouldn\u2019t there be at least one correct in a dozen questions?1Xu Yaoguang himself had several questions that he couldn\u2019t figure out either.\u201cCould you show me her answer card?\u201d Xu Yaoguang asked. His voice was cool, and he was polite and indifferent. \u201cQin Ran\u2019s.\u201dWu Yan didn\u2019t expect Xu Yaoguang to talk to her. She blushed and said awkwardly, \u201cOh\u2026 OK.\u201dShe immediately handed Qin Ran\u2019s answer card to Xu Yaoguang.Xu Yaoguang put the physics paper on his desk, then picked up his English paper and started to look at Qin Ran\u2019s answer card.Qiao Sheng was still waiting for Xu Yaoguang to go to dinner. He was sitting at his desk, stretching his legs into the aisle and playing basketball in his hands.He stretched his head and smiled suddenly. \u201cNo way, did she score zero again? Hurry up, Young Master Xu, give me her paper so I can mock her later.\u201dQin Ran was usually cold and dry, and since she had just been selected as the campus belle, her reputation had spread quickly.In each class, there were many boys dangling at the window of Class 3.9.But she was a flower above all others and didn\u2019t care about anyone. In the class, she only talked to Lin Siran and Qiao Sheng.COMMENTSome outsiders wanted to provoke Qin Ran but forgot about it at the thought of Qiao Sheng.Who didn\u2019t know that in First Middle School, Qiao Sheng was a rich second-generation, and the newly-built teaching building just completed by the school had been donated by his family?Xu Yaoguang handed the paper to him, his brows furrowed.The paper was fully written, yet it was still zero points. Xu Yaoguang thought for a moment and thought it wasn\u2019t right.\u201cCome on, Qin Yu is waiting for us.\u201d Qiao Sheng pressed the paper under the book and patted the basketball again, urging him.They had agreed to listen to Qin Yu practice the violin, which was said to be a new song.When referring to Qin Yu, Xu Yaoguang paused. He didn\u2019t think about Qin Ran anymore and his pace accelerated.**When Qin Ran went to the school medical office, Lu Zhaoying had finished sending the last patient.Then, he turned his head and scratched his hair. \u201cMaster Juan, why do you think the order was accepted?\u201dCheng Juan wasn\u2019t sleeping today, which was a rare sight. He leaned on the sofa with a laptop on his legs.Leaning slightly on the back of the sofa, his face was lazy and his long eyelashes were down, like a row of brushes. On the computer in front of him was a pile of tedious data, and he seemed to be thinking deeply.\u201cNo, I heard that this person hasn\u2019t taken orders for more than a year\u2026\u201d Lu Zhaoying stood up suddenly and wanted to continue talking, \u201cThe order\u2026 but what are we having for lunch today?\u201dHe was very stiff and changed the subject very bluntly.Cheng Juan closed the laptop computer calmly.Qin Ran glanced sideways, squinting her apricot eyes slightly. She chuckled indifferently when she saw Lu Zhaoying\u2019s eyes widening. \u201cFish.\u201dLu Zhaoying immediately took the car key. \u201cOh yeah, Old Wang just asked me to get the ingredients for the evening!\u201dAfter eating lunch, half of the lunchtime was already over.Qin Ran washed her hands and took her jacket and left.The sun was shining.She had to put on her peaked cap as she passed the Art Building.The sound of the violin came out of the open window on the second floor, and it sounded familiar.Qin Ran paused. Her eyes were cold as she reached down and pressed her cap, looking towards the second floor.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was obvious that his expression wasn\u2019t the same anymore. He leaned on the side of the violin and knocked his fingers unconsciously.1He was surrounded by people from the Student Union who had come to listen to Qin Yu practice the violin.Qin Yu had said today that she wanted to practice a new song, so they had all come ready to record on their mobile phones.The violin sounded for a minute and suddenly came to an end.Xu Yaoguang\u2019s eyes were dizzy and didn\u2019t know what to say.Seeing that there wasn\u2019t any movement, he turned his head and softened his voice when he talked to Qin Yu. His gaze fell on the violin in Qin Yu\u2019s hand. \u201cWhy did you stop?\u201dQin Yu held the violin in her hand tightly. She smiled brightly. \u201cThis has not been practiced well. I usually secretly practice it, so it\u2019s not perfect. I will perform for you when I practice it a few more times.\u201d1Everyone in the student council said that it was fine and wanted to keep her going as she was playing very well.Xu Yaoguang stood silently and didn\u2019t speak. His eyebrows were warm, but he was cold. No one dared to approach him except Qiao Sheng and a few others.1He had some knowledge of the violin and had heard it. Qin Yu\u2019s violin melody was very cryptic.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can practice slowly.\u201d He stood upright and, although there was no smile on his face, his voice was still gentle. \u201cI won\u2019t disturb you, then.\u201dQin Yu watched as Xu Yaoguang left.She pulled a chair and sat down.The student union basically left with Xu Yaoguang, and there were only a few girls left.\u201cWhy not continue?\u201d The baby-faced girl didn\u2019t hear the crypticness but could feel that the violin melody was really good this time. \u201cI thought it sounded good.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d Wu Yan managed to mingle with Qin Yu\u2019s group and quickly said.Qin Yu leaned on the chair and shook her head when she heard the words. She lowered her eye. The violin sheet was short and messy. She had tidied for the whole night only to remember it vaguely.She could barely play it, but there was no emotion and she couldn\u2019t get engrossed.1While others couldn\u2019t hear it, Xu Yaoguang had definitely heard it. It was very obscure, so she simply stopped.Because the tone of the whole score was very grand and had a strong personal touch, Qin Yu didn\u2019t know what kind of person could write such a score.1She wondered.Wu Yan went to the window and prepared to open the curtains, but saw Qin Ran downstairs.\u201cWhy is she here?\u201d Wu Yan\u2019s distasteful tone was quite unfriendly, with a stinging hostility.This new campus belle had a good reputation with boys, but the girls had been gossiping about her, especially because she had been kicked out of school for a year because of fighting.The babyfaced girl glanced over and saw Qiao Sheng chasing Qin Ran, and her fingers squeezed unconsciously. \u201cWhy is Qiao Sheng playing with her?\u201d\u201cWell, Qiao Sheng is mocking her.\u201d Wu Yan gloated. \u201cYou know, she sent her English paper today and scored zero. She\u2019s even the campus belle. Qin Yu, you got 117, it\u2019s so much higher than her score.\u201dQin Yu was originally unhappy because of that violin score.When she heard what Wu Yan said, she was inexplicably in a good mood. She smiled a little. \u201cOkay, why are you guys comparing that. There\u2019s nothing to compare.\u201d4**Downstairs.Qin Ran wanted to continue to listen, but the music voice had stopped, making her uncertain.2Coincidentally, Qiao Sheng and Xu Yaoguang had come down. She thought about it and went on to the classroom.Qiao Sheng chased and mocked her.Qin Ran lowered her peaked cap, took the headset out of her pocket and put it on herself in a cool fashion.Qiao Sheng leaned closer to her, amplified his voice, and continued to taunt her.Qin Ran reached out and pressed the headset. She tilted her head, then stretched out a thin white finger to make a \u201cshut up\u201d gesture.Her pair of cold eyes stared at Qiao Sheng.Qiao Sheng: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe stepped back silently.Qin Ran continued lazily to the teaching building.In the classroom, Qiao Sheng pulled out Qin Ran\u2019s test paper from the book and handed it to her.Leaning on the table in front of Qin Ran and chatting with Lin Siran, Qin Ran usually ignored him.She sat down while eaning halfway against the wall, taking her extracurricular books from the table with one hand, and a lollipop on her other hand.1Throwing the book to the table, she slowly peeled off the sugar paper and put it into her mouth.She continued leaning against the wall and lazily flipping through the book. Her side eyebrows were raised deliberately.\u201cAren\u2019t you childish, eating candy?\u201d Qiao Sheng couldn\u2019t hold back.Qin Ran turned another page casually. Maybe she was in a good mood, so she wasn\u2019t as closed and cold as before. She said slowly, \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you? Get lost.\u201dQiao Sheng touched his nose. He sat back at his seat, laid on the table, thought about it, and poked at Xu Yaoguang who was doing the exercises. \u201cYoung Master Xu, do you want to go to the store after class?\u201dXu Yaoguang was indifferent, but he was willing to do it for his brother and thought that Qiao Sheng was probably hungry. \u201cYeah.\u201d**In the evening, Qin Ran continued to go to the school medical office.This time, Lu Zhaoying was somewhat normal.He had a patient, so Qin Ran ignored him and went to the kitchen to cook today\u2019s dinner.When she came out, Lu Zhaoying was on a phone call outside.As Qin Ran took a paper towel from the table and wiped her hands, her eyes fell on the assortment of medicine cabinets. There were a lot more medicines than when she had first seen them and didn\u2019t seem like a normal store.She didn\u2019t care that there were several more medicines, and her eyes only fell on the sleeping pills.Cheng Juan was looking at the computer. Seeing this, he didn\u2019t think much about it. He came over with the key to the medicine cabinet.He reached out to open the door of the medicine cabinet, leaned slightly to the side, and put his fingers on the sleeping pills. His fingers were long and casual. \u201cDid you finish the sleeping pills?\u201dHe had a very slow voice. It sounded lazy and slow and made her relax.\u201cYeah.\u201d Qin Ran nodded directly.Cheng Juan lowered his head again and counted ten pills seriously.Then, he went to get a paper bag.The medicine cabinet was just right behind Lu Zhaoying\u2019s desk so that he could reach it with a kick.Cheng Juan reached over Qin Ran to get the bag.Qin Ran only smelled a mild mint flavor. It was warm and calm, making her want to be close.A warm breath fell to her side and it burned a little.Qin Ran calmly took a step back.Cheng Juan was thinking about the pile of data and didn\u2019t think anything was wrong.They were very close.He fetched the paper bag and turned to the side.He put the medicine in the bag and didn\u2019t dare look more, but the glaring hot scene replayed in his mind.She wasn\u2019t wearing a school uniform, only wearing a white shirt. Her neckline was a little crooked, and her collarbone was faintly exposed.On that shoulder, a red tattoo revealed the tip of the iceberg.This red color lined her skin and made it seem even whiter, colliding with her strong sense of brightness and beauty.He didn\u2019t know who had tattooed her.1\u201cDone.\u201d Cheng Juan didn\u2019t glance over. He handed the folded medicine bag to Qin Ran and couldn\u2019t help but say when he saw her happy expression, \u201cDon\u2019t eat too many.\u201d4\u201cThank you.\u201d Qin Ran took it.Lu Zhaoying, who had gone out to answer the call, came back and hurriedly said, \u201cMaster Juan, is your computer ready?\u201d\u201cNearly.\u201d Cheng Juan threw the computer to Lu Zhaoying and wasn\u2019t very patient. \u201cLook at it yourself.\u201d1\u201cDamn it, they\u2019re urging us.\u201d Lu Zhaoying looked at the computer page that still had a large number of strange numbers. \u201cOK, I\u2019ll go ask Elder Xu. There aren\u2019t many technical people here.\u201dHe left with the computer.Qin Ran took her coat and was going to leave, but when she saw how anxious Lu Zhaoying was, she stopped, turned back and said, \u201cActually\u2026\u201dLiked it?

The computer wasn\u2019t broken, it had been hacked by someone.The hacking method was very advanced and only experts could see it.Someone was hacking their computer to capture data. Obviously, Cheng Juan\u2019s computer firewall was designed by a special person, so it would take a while for the other party to crack it.Finding Principal Xu would delay too much time, and he might not know what to do either.Lu Zhaoying was in full swing, holding the computer and going out without even eating the dishes on the table.Qin Ran thought for a while and held her mouth.It was Cheng Juan who rolled his sleeves and sat down to eat dinner. His brows were gentle as he asked Qin Ran politely, \u201cDo you want to eat together?\u201dQin Ran shook her head. She was troubled and absentminded when she put on her coat and walked out.Behind her, Cheng Juan glanced at her and frowned slightly. He slowly lifted the fishbone from his hands.1As soon as she left the school hospital, Qin Ran\u2019s cell phone rang.It was her aunt. Her voice brought a smile and she was obviously very happy. \u201cRan Ran, your mother and your sister are coming to my house for dinner tonight, so you should come here too.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there at night. I might be late, so eat first and don\u2019t wait for me,\u201d Qin Ran said and turned towards the bathroom quickly.It might be too late for Lu Zhaoying to find Principal Xu. He was so anxious, and the person that Principal Xu would find later might only be a person who studied computering. By the time he realized that the computer had been under attack, the information inside would have already been leaked.Qin Ran wasn\u2019t a nosy person, but she thought of Cheng Juan\u2019s order\u2026She returned to the dormitory and no one was inside. She took out her computer, sat at the table, and put her hands on the keyboard to start it.The computer desktop was still very clean, but today the background image wasn\u2019t a filled desert, but the ocean, with no other icon.Cheng Juan\u2019s computer was linked to the school medical office\u2019s private network.Finding the IP address was easy. Half the screen of the computer was full of jumping characters, mixed with a lot of 0s and 1s.The speed they were jumping at was very fast. Under normal circumstances, even this high-speed computer would slowly stagnate, but her computer seemed unaffected and still moved quickly.The dormitory was filled with sounds of doors opening and people talking.It was very noisy.\u201cMingyue, wait for me, I\u2019ll get a carton of milk.\u201d Outside the bedroom, Lin Siran trotted to the bedroom quickly in order to not let Pan Mingyue wait.There was someone in the bedroom door, and she was surprised when she pushed the door open. \u201cQin Ran, why are you in the bedroom?\u201dPan Mingyue was behind Lin Siran and heard the voice, so she looked in the direction of Qin Ran.Qin Ran was almost done.She cut to a game screen without changing her expression when they came in.Lin Siran took out three boxes of milk on the table, gave Qin Ran one, Pan Mingyue another, and came over. \u201cOh, Ran Ran, you also play this. A lot of people in our class play this. Last year, Qiao Sheng also missed class just to go to the Internet cafe to enter some league. Old Gao even punished him to clean the toilet for a week.\u201dOld Gao was their class teacher Gao Yang.Qin Ran said \u201cum\u201d and looked intently at the screen. Her hands moved quickly and sharply.Lin Siran didn\u2019t really understand the game, but just looking at Qin Ran, she felt that the game was very simple. How was it as difficult as those people in the class had described it?Pan Mingyue stood on the side. She inserted the straw into the milk and drank with a small sip. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to get the papers from Teacher Gao\u2019s office?\u201dShe whispered.Lin Siran immediately thought about it and jumped up. \u201cI almost forgot. Qin Ran, see you!\u201dShe pulled Pan Mingyue out.And closed the bedroom door.Qin Ran got rid of the game page.She switched the page, took care of it, and then kept the computer to get ready to head to Ning Wei\u2019s place.**At the same time, a small corner in the country.The curtains in the room were pulled, and the inside was very dark. There was only the fluorescence light from a computer, and there was a strange expression on a person\u2019s face.The man sitting in front of the computer was Luo Saihu. He was chubby, slightly fat, and wore glasses. He had a deep outline, like a mixed race, and his hands moved at a fast speed.COMMENTSnap\u2014The computer suddenly turned black and the room fell into darkness.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d The man behind had a scar on his face, and when he opened his mouth, he looked like a writhing, cruel cricket. He was tall, broad, and his evil tendencies seemed extremely heavy. There was darkness in his eyes that could make people tremble.\u201cMy attack has been stopped by someone.\u201d Luo Saihu rubbed his beard and was bewildered.Scarface frowned. Few people could stop his attack. \u201cThe higher-ups of Huameng are meddling in this?\u201d\u201cHuameng has its own symbol. This matter is not Huameng\u2019s.\u201d Luo Saihu shook his head.Scarface was impatient. \u201cWho is it then, if it\u2019s not them?\u201dLuo Saihu continued shaking his head.**When Qin Ran arrived at Ning Wei\u2019s house, Ning Qing and Qin Yu had arrived long ago. The dishes were on the table and they were eating.Mu Nan saw that she was here, put down his bowl and chopsticks and moved a chair for her in silence.Ning Qing waited impatiently and gave her a glance. \u201cYou clearly ended class with your sister, why are you so late?\u201dQin Ran hung her backpack on the back of the chair, greeted Ning Wei and sat down. Her words were dull and concise. \u201cI was busy.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ning Qing tightened her hand on the chopsticks.1Qin Yu quickly placed some vegetables on Ning Qing\u2019s plate. \u201cMom, don\u2019t you like this the most, and sister didn\u2019t mean it, right?\u201dShe turned her head and looked at Qin Ran, smiling sweetly.\u201cGood girl.\u201d Ning Qing smiled. She reached for Qin Yu\u2019s bowl and filled it with a bowl of soup. \u201cYour aunt\u2019s soup is delicious, try it.\u201dNing Qing had always spoken sweetly to Qin Yu and didn\u2019t dare to say anything heavy to her.Qin Yu was outstanding, and Lin Jinxuan, Lin Wan, and Lin Qi all valued her. Thanks to Qin Yu, Ning Qing\u2019s position in the Lin family was consolidated.Ning Qing lived too clearly. She knew exactly what she wanted and what was good for her.Moreover, not to mention the Lin family, with Qin Yu\u2019s current development, it wouldn\u2019t be bad in the future.\u201cIt\u2019s delicious.\u201d Qin Yu smiled.Ning Qing scooped soup for her again. \u201cYes, your aunt is very good at cooking. If you want to drink it, I\u2019ll get her to stew it.\u201dShe talked to Qin Yu and ignored Qin Ran.Qin Yu smiled. She raised her eyebrows and looked at Qin Ran calmly.The expression on Qin Ran\u2019s face didn\u2019t change, and she didn\u2019t speak. She chewed on a pork rib slowly. When they were young, their neighbor had brought her lots of books. She had stopped Qin Yu from taking her books and made her cry.When an adult came, it became such that she had stolen Qin Yu\u2019s stuff. The adults persuaded her incessantly to let her younger sister be since she was younger. After a few more times, Ning Qing and Qin Hanqiu both became impatient with her.Neighbors had always said that she was smarter than Qin Yu and was a genius, but was Qin Yu stupid? No.Later, when she got older, she understood that the crying child always won.4Ning Wei picked up a rib again for Qin Ran. Mu Ying, who was sitting next to Ning Wei, finally found a chance to speak. \u201cSecond cousin, I\u2019m going to First Middle School soon. I heard mum say that you\u2019re in the top class, then your results must be very good. What school are you going to go?\u201d\u201cShe wants to be admitted to Peking University.\u201d Before Qin Yu could speak, Ning Qing said gently. \u201cShe wants to go to the same university as her brother.\u201dPeking University was the best university in the country. Almost every high school senior yearned to enter the school, and only a few students from Yun Cheng were accepted per year.Mu Ying\u2019s eyes were envious. \u201cSecond cousin is amazing.\u201dQin Yu had no appetite. Ning Wei\u2019s house was small and messy, and her things were dirty. Except for drinking a few mouthfuls of soup, she didn\u2019t even move her chopsticks.Upon hearing this, she looked at Qin Ran awkwardly and said with a smile on her face, \u201cDon\u2019t keep talking about me. My sister is also a senior. By the way, sister, which school do you want to go to?\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her face was slightly stiff and she didn\u2019t speak.Mu Ying was embarrassed. She looked at Qin Yu and then at Qin Ran, not knowing what to say.Mu Nan didn\u2019t even lift his head.Qin Yu seemed to finally react and stuck her tongue out. \u201cMom, did I say something wrong?\u201d3\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Hearing Qin Yu\u2019s voice, Ning Qing smiled.Qin Ran sat on her stool with her legs crossed, as calm as ever, and she looked up slightly and said slowly, \u201cI\u2019m going to Beijing.\u201dNote that she said that she wanted to go to Beijing, not Peking University.1It was just that the people at the table didn\u2019t notice.All of them were a little stunned. Even Mu Nan held his chopsticks and looked at Qin Ran thoughtfully.Qin Yu sniggered and ate a piece of vegetable. While eating, she said with a smile, \u201cOh, so sister wants to go to Peking University too. Add oil then, I\u2019ll wait for you there.\u201dSnap\u2014Ning Qing finally couldn\u2019t bear it. She threw down her chopsticks and pressed Qin Ran. \u201cPeking University? Do you think it\u2019s so easy for you? Qin Ran, let me tell you, next year, no matter what school you can go to, you have to go!\u201dShe had a thin face, especially since there was such a big difference between the Lin and Ning families. In front of the Lin family, she was even more careful.That was why she couldn\u2019t rely on Qin Hanqiu and had to take Qin Ran to Yun Cheng for high school. Ning Qing could endure it for one year, but if Qin Ran really wanted to go to Peking University, then didn\u2019t it mean she would have to stay a few more years?2Ning Qing absolutely would not allow this to happen.Qin Ran took another rib, her movement casual. She glanced at Ning Qing and smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. I don\u2019t need you to control me.\u201d\u201cWho else but me\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been by myself for the past ten years.\u201d Qin Ran interrupted her, looked up, and said indifferently and dauntlessly, \u201cDon\u2019t take grandmother\u2019s plate suddenly at this time. Do I need to remind you which matter you helped me out in when I came to Yun Cheng?\u201d1Ning Qing\u2019s face was stiff.Her face turned blue.She was suddenly embarrassed.She couldn\u2019t control it if Qin Ran wanted to go to school.Qin Ran didn\u2019t take any of the things she had prepared for her.She had let Qin Ran stay in the Lin family\u2019s house, but she didn\u2019t.Her daughter had changed so much from the past. The information she had dug out was correct. Qin Ran was really a thorn in one\u2019s heart.1Now that Ning Qing remembered it, Qin Ran retracted her gaze and propped her legs rudely and casually. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you can remember it.\u201dOnly her grandmother could control her.1Ning Qing was a little embarrassed, but she was also angry. Qin Yu had never shamed her like that before. \u201cFine, you are the ancestor. You are so good, but when you can\u2019t pass the exam, don\u2019t come begging me and the Lin family to arrange a college for you. I won\u2019t help you!\u201d1\u201cThank you.\u201d Qin Ran was very sincere.Ning Wei coughed. She clamped a piece of fish without bones for Qin Ran. \u201cRan Ran, that\u2019s enough.\u201dQin Ran lowered her head and plucked the fish, forming an \u201cOK\u201d sign with her hands.In addition to her grandmother, she also respected Ning Wei more than Ning Qing.After dinner, Qin Yu and Ning Qing both decided to go back. Ning Wei\u2019s house was old and shabby. Qin Yu, who was used to living in the villa, felt it was really disgusting.1\u201cAuntie, second cousin, I will send you down.\u201d Mu Ying stood up immediately.Qin Yu glanced at her and said indifferently, \u201cThank you.\u201dMu Ying was flattered. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d2Before leaving, Ning Qing passed by Qin Ran. \u201cI\u2019ll apologize to you about what happened last time. I went overboard. I was just\u2026 I just don\u2019t want you to end up like your grandfather. Listen to me and I will spend some money to help you get a normal university.\u201dQin Ran said nothing.Ning Qing turned to catch up with Qin Yu. \u201cQin Ran, you really disappoint me.\u201d1Qin Ran held a mug with strawberries printed on it, which was the special teacup she used at her aunt\u2019s house.She remembered that Ning Qing was talking about what had happened at the hospital yesterday and lowered her head to take a sip of water.She didn\u2019t expect Ning Qing to apologize.She stood by the window and looked downstairs, a little embarrassed.After a while, she looked at the layout of the room with her glass of water. It was very small.A call was made to the air-conditioning installation company to install the air-conditioner tomorrow. Qin Ran returned to school before Ning Wei could nag her.**At First Middle School.Lu Zhaoying took the computer to Principal Xu\u2019s office.Principal Xu thought for a moment and found him a person.\u201cThis is Feng Ci. He majors in computer science at Peking University.\u201d President Xu introduced the two. \u201cNow he has started a company in partnership with others and developed his own software.\u201d\u201cMr. Lu.\u201d Feng Ci had a stiff face, the hand he stretched out was slender and clean, with a thick layer of callus. His eyes were deep, his lips thin, and his nose bridge high. He was handsome and was quite young, but already had the aura of a successful elite person.Feng Ci knew that President Xu was trying to draw connections for him.Lu\u2026In Peking University, he had also pondered the situation in Beijing in the past two years. If he was really part of the \u201cLu\u201d family, then he really owed Principal Xu a big favor.Feng Ci brought a USB flash drive and repair tools.First, he turned on Lu Zhaoying\u2019s computer.\u201cHow is it, can it be repaired in a short time?\u201d Lu Zhaoying came over, the earrings in his left ear shining.Feng Ci frowned slightly. He checked the computer several times but found no major problems.Feng Ci opened the settings and entered a large series of codes. A bunch of data that normal people couldn\u2019t understand jumped and he stayed on the page.\u201cMr. Lu, your computer has indeed been attacked,\u201d Feng Ci said, quoting his historical records. \u201cThe other party has left a mark. It was probably a hacker.\u201d\u201cBlack Eagle?\u201d Lu Zhaoying snorted. \u201cIs our data record still there?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Feng Ci looked at the computer with an unpredictable expression. \u201cSomeone has helped you counterattack.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lu Zhaoying found something was strange now.Speaking of Black Eagle, he had heard of him before while on a certain mission. This man was a famous hacker. As long as he was given money, he could do good and bad things. The police had been watching him for a while now already.But he hid well without revealing anything.There were thousands of hackers, but they were very advanced among hackers, and even rarer. The Black Eagles in China could rank at least in the top ten.So, after hearing that the attacker was Black Eagle, Lu Zhaoying had guessed that a bunch of data they had investigated was probably gone.Unexpectedly, Feng Ci had told him otherwise. A hacker helped them counterattack? A hacker who could fight with the Black Eagle.\u201cDo you know who it is?\u201d Lu Zhaoying looked serious.Feng Ci shook his head. \u201cThe other party left no clue.\u201dLu Zhaoying looked up with his head full of thoughts and stood up.Cheng Juan was already outside. He was tall, his head bowed down, and his figure leaned lazily against the door frame. \u201cHave you fixed it?\u201dLu Zhaoying said, \u201cMaster Juan, you came in the nick of time. The data is fine, I\u2019ll send them over first. But this matter has become more complicated. A God who refuses to be named has helped us. Do you know who it is?\u201dLooking at Lu Zhaoying\u2019s attitude, Feng Ci looked at Cheng Juan. Lu Zhaoying had called him\u2014Master Juan?He paused.If Lu Zhaoying\u2019s identity was right, this Master Juan was\u2026Liked it?

Back in the days, Principal Xu had taught them Mathematics and even held private enrichment classes for him when he was participating in Mathematics competitions. He could somewhat be considered Principal Xu\u2019s disciple.He hadn\u2019t put much thought into it, and only until he started up his own firm in the capital city did he realize how this \u201cstatus\u201d really came in handy.He slowly learned more about Principal Xu\u2019s status and identity as well.There was only one family in the whole of the capital city that could have Principal Xu address as Young Master Lu.As for this Master Juan\u2026Feng Ci did not know much about him. Although he was a relatively big shot in his own city, the capital city was full of people from the high society, and he was nowhere close to that league. Even with Principal Xu\u2019s name, he could only get access to general information such as finding out who were the people he couldn\u2019t afford to offend.Feng Ci looked away.Cheng Juan was leaning against the doorframe and had his eyes on the computer screen. His expression was unreadable.About a minute later, he looked up and said firmly, \u201cNot too sure, there haven\u2019t been any suspicious parties yet.\u201dBased on Lu Zhaoying\u2019s understanding of Cheng Juan, he\u2019d probably been able to go through the entire mental list of people he knew in that one minute.\u201cThen that\u2019s too bad.\u201d Lu Zhaoying felt it was a pity. He turned to the computer screen, churned out some data and sent it out to the relevant parties.Seeing that they seemed to have unfinished business to discuss, Feng Ci politely excused himself.Lu Zhaoying leaned back in his seat and smiled as he fiddled with his ear stud. \u201cHold up, we are about to leave too. Let\u2019s exchange our Wechat account details.\u201dFeng Ci wasn\u2019t expecting these Young Masters to be so friendly.The three of them walked downstairs together and Cheng Juan led the way with both hands in his pockets. The sun had not set completely, and it cast long shadows of the school buildings.He walked slowly and quietly, without the youthfulness of the First Middle School students. But judging by the girls who only dared steal glances at him but not approach him directly, one could tell that the pride that ran deep in his veins was unmistakable.Lu Zhaoying was consistently about half a step behind Cheng Juan as he spoke to Feng Ci.Not too far away, Lin Siran and Pan Mingyue were going to the Dean\u2019s office together to get some scripts.Lu Zhaoying knew Lin Siran as an acquaintance; he\u2019d seen her a few times at club activities.\u201cSchoolmate Lin, where\u2019s your deskmate?\u201d Lu Zhaoying called out to her. He then caught sight of Pan Mingyue and smiled. \u201cHey, do you always make friends based on looks?\u201dLin Siran and Qin Ran had bumped into Lu Zhaoying a few times. He\u2019d even bought them milk tea before.\u201cShe\u2019s busy.\u201d Lin Siran responded with the scripts held tightly in her hands.Cheng Juan hesitated for a while before nodding slightly towards Lin Siran and then taking his leave.Feng Ci was walking towards the school\u2019s main gate. Seeing the two Young Masters taking interest in speaking to a girl, he wondered who she was. He walked over.Lin Siran was a little uncomfortable. She quietly said, \u201cMingyue, let\u2019s get going\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy have you moved into the dormitory to stay on campus?\u201d A low voice stopped her mid-sentence.Lin Siran was a little shocked. She glanced at the smart-looking Feng Ci opposite her and then turned towards Pan Mingyue. Something felt wrong.Pan Mingyue was holding onto the scripts with one hand and grabbing Lin Siran\u2019s hand with the other. Her huge glistening eyes were beautiful.\u201cThe workload for Third Year students is heavy. It\u2019s more convenient for me to stay on campus.\u201d Pan Mingyue tightened her grip on the scripts and answered coldly.\u201cMingyue\u2026\u201d Feng Ci furrowed his brows, wanting to say more.But Pan Mingyue pulled Lin Siran aside and made a move to leave. \u201cI\u2019m going to distribute the scripts.\u201dFeng Ci stood on the spot for a while longer before deciding to leave.Pan Mingyue only slowed down her footsteps when she was certain that Feng Ci had turned around to leave too.Lin Siran looked at Pan Mingyue in shock and excitement. \u201cMingyue, you actually know Feng Ci! He used to be the man of the moment in our school!\u201dLin Siran was from the affiliated stream in Junior Middle School. Back when she was there, she\u2019d heard of Lin Jinxuan and Feng Ci, the two big names in the Senior Middle School.\u201cI heard that Feng Ci and Lin Jinxuan are both starting up a firm now.\u201d Lin Siran gossiped with her volume down. \u201cYou know, Qin Yu from your class is Lin Jinxuan\u2019s younger sister. Back then, both of them had Qin Yu\u2019s back, and the influence she had was unparalleled. Moreover, you know that our Mayor\u2019s family name is Feng, right? I really never expected you to know Feng Ci, but well, everyone who mixes with him is somewhat outstanding.\u201d1Pan Mingyue shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m a distant relative of the Feng family, but I\u2019m not close to Feng Ci. I\u2019d ever put up at his place before, and I know that they\u2019re all outstanding, but I can\u2019t be compared to them.\u201d\u201cWhy can\u2019t you! You\u2019re the second in the whole school! You\u2019re always just a few points behind Xu Yaoguang, but tens of points ahead of the third person. Mingyue, don\u2019t look down on yourself this way. Before my deskmate came along, there were even debates about whether you or Qin Yu were the rightful School Belle!\u201dBut ever since Qin Ran joined the school, posts like this had stopped appearing.Pan Mingyue suddenly smiled as her gaze looked distant. \u201cMy results used to be terrible. I got a single-digit score for Mathematics.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d Lin Siran wouldn\u2019t buy it. Pan Mingyue\u2019s Mathematics grades were only second to Xu Yaoguang.Mathematics wasn\u2019t like other subjects, it was based on practice and prior experience. Given her outstanding results now, how could she ever be bad at it?2Pan Mingyue smiled without explaining further.She and Lin Siran parted ways at the foot of the stairs.Lin Siran looked at Pan Mingyue\u2019s back view. She knew Pan Mingyue because of a competition; they were deskmates in the competition preparation class. She always felt that Pan Mingyue exuded an inexplicable air of sorrow.They\u2019d known each other for two years, and Lin Siran had never heard Pan Mingyue mention her parents.**A few days later.Qin Ran rested her head on the desk between classes. It was noisy outside and she couldn\u2019t keep her eyes closed. Eventually, she rested her chin on her palm unhappily.Lin Siran distributed everybody\u2019s scripts and finally handed the last one to Qin Ran.6 marks.Better than the previous time.Lin Siran consoled herself.\u201cWe\u2019re welcoming new students in school today, it\u2019ll be pretty bustling.\u201d Lin Siran saw that Qin Ran looked a little flushed and unhappy and asked in concern, \u201cRan Ran, are you unwell?\u201dShe knew that Qin Ran was working part-time outside. It was pouring so heavily last night and she didn\u2019t have an umbrella, she must\u2019ve been drenched on the way back from the milk tea store.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Qin Ran sounded a little down. She turned sideways and leaned against the wall instead.Lin Siran was a little worried for her.1She got another classmate to bring some flu tablets over and made sure Qin Ran ate one.Qin Ran felt even more drowsy after having the medicine, but she still couldn\u2019t sleep.The sounds of the new students from downstairs buzzed in her head.She put on her earphones and turned the volume up.After hours, she finally made it through the whole day of school. It was crowded everywhere, except for the school doctor\u2019s office in the corner. Qin Ran heaved a sigh of relief.In the school doctor\u2019s office.As it was the first day of school for the new students, the doctor\u2019s office was unusually empty.It was nice and quiet.Lu Zhaoying had his laptop on his lap and went onto a site with a full black background. He was chatting with somebody online, and the symbols used were rather strange; an ordinary person wouldn\u2019t be able to make out what they were.He was casually having a conversation.Until the other party sent a reply that almost caused him to choke.\u201cM-Master Juan,\u201d Lu Zhaoying widened his eyes at the screen and stammered, \u201cI think t-there\u2019s a clue.\u201dCheng Juan was looking through some patients\u2019 documents with a fountain pen in his hand. He was completely calm and hadn\u2019t even raised his head. \u201cWhy the fluster, shoot.\u201d\u201cBased on Flat Face\u2019s investigation, the person who helped us out goes by code name Q.\u201d1Bam\u2014Liked it?

When he\u2019d calmed down, a fog seemed to mask his face like a veil.He tipped his chin up slightly. \u201cAre you sure? That person doesn\u2019t seem that helpful.\u201d\u201cFlat Face already got it checked. He specially looked into the case of the seven undergraduates who\u2019d lost contact three months ago, the traces are very similar.\u201d Lu Zhaoying found it unusual too. With one hand resting on the keyboard, he turned around to look at Cheng Juan. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely for anyone else to be able to clamp down on Black Eagle, I think it must be that Q. You really don\u2019t know who that is?\u201dCheng Juan spun a lighter in his hands and looked through the glass pane as a girl walked towards the office door.Her cheeks were unusually red and brought out the paleness in the rest of her face. She seemed to be dragging her feet restlessly, and her zip went all the way up despite it being pretty warm and humid outside.In her state now, she seemed a lot less distant and unapproachable.She always seemed a little cold usually. But today, as she came teary-eyed, she seemed a little more delicate. Cheng Juan kept the cigarette between his lips and did not say a thing.Lu Zhaoying shut his laptop and kept his words when he saw Qin Ran coming.Qin Ran knew what they\u2019d been talking about before she came and that they were somewhat avoiding her. But she wasn\u2019t bothered, especially with this headache now.She went to the pantry first.Cheng Juan kept his documents and knocked on the tabletop. \u201cYou\u2019re sick?\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Qin Ran slowly made her way further into the kitchen. She sounded weak. \u201cA little.\u201d\u201cQin Ran, how did you fall ill? Come, have a rest here, I\u2019ll take your temperature.\u201d Lu Zhaoying immediately stood up and let Qin Ran take the seat.He went to get a thermometer for her.\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. I took some meds in the morning, I\u2019ll get cooking first,\u201d she casually said.Well, she was still as cool as usual.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Lu Zhaoying shook his head.\u201cYou\u2019re already sick, don\u2019t put up a front. Sit down first.\u201d Cheng Juan got up and let her have the couch seat. \u201cLu Zhaoying? Get En Yu Hotel to send some food here.\u201dLu Zhaoying was taken aback to see that Cheng Juan had given up his couch seat. But he went ahead to make the call anyway.\u201cDon\u2019t head to the canteen anymore, it\u2019s too crowded.\u201d Cheng Juan got a thermometer and handed it to her. \u201cTake your temperature first.\u201dQin Ran didn\u2019t think a fever was anything to fuss over? It wasn\u2019t as if she broke a limb anyway.She took her temperature\u201439.5\u00b0C.3Cheng Juan knitted his brows together and quickly prepared the IV bag to put her on a drip. He then got her a glass of warm water and even added some syrup as ill people usually felt very dry in the mouth.The couch was very comfortable to lean back in. She drank the sweetened water and felt drowsy as the sounds of Cheng Juan flipping his documents faded into the background.He could hear slow steady breathing from his side.Cheng Juan put his documents down and turned to look at her instead. Perhaps it was because she was sick, the headstrong vibe she usually exuded had dissipated. Her lashes were pointing downwards, and there was a pale green area beneath her eyes, emphasizing just how thin and fragile she looked. She was all curled up into a tiny ball in the corner of the couch as she didn\u2019t want to disturb him.Her arm that was resting on the side of the couch was pale and skinny as well, and the spot at which the needle had been injected was beginning to bruise.He looked at her for a while and felt something skip in his heart.It was rare for Qin Ran to sleep so soundly. When she woke up, the IV bag would\u2019ve been empty and the afternoon self-revision sessions would be almost over. Meanwhile, some porridge was being heated up on the stove.Lu Zhaoying gathered some medicine for another student.Seeing that she had taken some of the porridge and was eating at the table, he asked, \u201cDo you want me to help you apply for leave from classes?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Qin Ran shook her head and smiled. She spoke casually and without the distant tone that she had when she last met them. \u201cThank you for today.\u201dCheng Juan furrowed his brows slightly. He\u2019d prefer if she stayed and rested well for the afternoon, but he did not voice his opinion.When she\u2019d left, he put his documents down and finally lit the cigarette.Cheng Juan was getting frustrated.Lu Zhaoying seemed to think about something as he looked at him and stroked his chin.**Qin Ran recovered quickly and, by the afternoon, her fever had subsided. She was still a little weak but was in way better condition than in the morning.\u201c12 marks for Physics, 18 marks for Chemistry.\u201d Lin Siran helped Qin Ran get her scripts. \u201cRan Ran, you\u2019re amazing!\u201d1If she rounded it off, it would be considered a pass.1Qin Ran looked at Lin Siran but didn\u2019t say a thing.They received their English scripts in the last period.Xu Yaoguang did not leave immediately and didn\u2019t stop Qiao Sheng from going over to look for Qin Ran either. But his eyes were on them.\u201cHas your fever subsided?\u201d Qiao Sheng furrowed his brows slightly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you apply for leave?\u201dQin Ran nodded, picked up her books and sniffled. \u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d\u201cRest more and drink warm water.\u201d Qiao Sheng thought for a bit before returning to his seat and getting a lollipop from under his desk. He handed it to Qin Ran and raised his eyebrows cheekily. \u201cEat this.\u201d2At this point, Qin Yu had already arrived outside the Ninth Class and was waiting for Xu Yaoguang and Qiao Sheng. She was shocked to witness the scene before her.COMMENTShe turned away, not looking at Qin Ran.But she couldn\u2019t help but peek in that general again. Qiao Sheng always acted like a bratty Young Master; he sounded playful even when talking to her. It was rare to see him speak so gently to anyone.A while later.Qiao Sheng carried his bag and left with Xu Yaoguang through the back door.The first thing he said was \u201cYoung Master Xu, Qin Ran\u2019s English scores improved. 30 marks!\u201d He was mocking her.30 marks. Xu Yaoguang furrowed his brows. He was really overthinking it when Qiao Sheng approached her.\u201c30 marks?\u201d\u201cYup, that\u2019s a huge improvement. She had a score of 0 the last time.\u201d Qiao Sheng placed his hands in his pocket.Qin Yu saw that Xu Yaoguang still looked cold and disinterested. He simply smiled but did not say anymore.She felt relieved.The three of them were influential figures in school. Anyone of their appearances could get schoolmates whispering in one another\u2019s ears, not to mention when they appeared together.Some students would even stop at the foot of the stairs to wait for them, so they could walk together.Fifth Class of the new students.\u201cMu Ying, let\u2019s go off together.\u201d Mu Ying\u2019s deskmate was a bubbly girl with a ponytail. She was from the affiliated stream too and was called Li Yuhan.Both of them did not live on campus.Easygoing as she was, Li Yuhan casually hooked her arms around Mu Ying\u2019s.With the arrival of new students today, the campus was bustling with crowds everywhere.There was some commotion further up in front of them.From a distance, they saw that a line of three people was the source of the commotion. There was a girl in a dress and not in the school uniform. Beside her were two guys whose looks were rather outstanding.\u201cAh ah ah! Mu Ying, look, that cool-looking guy over there is our nerdy School Hunk! He\u2019s a Year Three student, Xu Yaoguang! The other guy is Qiao Sheng, the heir of the Qiao mandate!\u201d Li Yuhan squeezed Mu Ying\u2019s arm in excitement. \u201cAnd the girl beside them, do you know who she is?\u201d\u201cI do, she\u2019s the School Belle of First Middle School\u2026\u201d Mu Ying looked towards Qin Yu in some envy. She was having some mixed feelings as she saw the fine-looking guys beside the beautiful girl.\u201cPfft, what School Belle? What era is your information from?\u201d Li Yuhan looked away from Qin Yu. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that the School Belle has changed since the day the Year Threes started having lessons?\u201d\u201cThe School Belle has changed?\u201d Mu Ying heard about this news only during the summer break and was stunned at this new information. \u201cWho is it now?\u201dLiked it?

Her surname is Qin too, called Qin Ran. There\u2019s a picture on the post of a good looking bandit, but now it\u2019s gone, so you can only see her by going to the third-grader\u2019s building. Oh yeah, she\u2019s in the same class as Campus King Xu. I heard that their class is always filled with people after each class.\u201dMu Ying didn\u2019t know what to say for a moment.1She should have thought about it already. Her mum had also said before that based on looks, none of the descendants in the Ning family could match up to Qin Ran.She pursed her lips and pondered to herself while nodding.The two of them walked slowly.Xu Yaoguang and Qin Yu were about to pass them soon.Li Yuhan held Mu Ying\u2019s hand a little harder and said excitedly, \u201cI am actually so close to the three of them?!\u201dMu Ying also thought out.Looking at Qin Yu talking to Xu Yaoguang, she opened her mouth and almost wanted to call her cousin, but didn\u2019t expect Qin Yu to pass by her directly.\u201cMu Ying, Mu Ying, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Watching Qin Yu and the three of them walk out of sight, Li Yuhan patted Mu Ying, who was in tears.3Mu Ying tucked her hair behind her ears self-consciously, still looking at the direction of Qin Yu. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dThe two opened the door and saw two cars not far away, a BMW and a Maybach.It was for Qin Yu and Qiao Sheng. Xu Yaoguang lived on campus.1\u201cI invite you to drink milk tea.\u201d Li Yuhan dragged her to the milk tea shop across the street. \u201cThe milk tea shop next door is delicious, but unfortunately, there are too many people queuing for it. Let\u2019s go to the shop with fewer people.\u201d**Qin Ran was always in no hurry to leave once the class had ended. It was always too crowded and noisy.She stayed in the class for a while.It happened that the biology teacher was hurriedly taking the papers. He didn\u2019t enter the class and saw Qin Ran, who was just walking past. He taught several classes and there were many people in each class, so he couldn\u2019t remember everybody\u2019s names.But he knew this student. She was a freshman and had poor learning but was good-looking. \u201cQin Ran, bring the papers to Zhong Da and let him bring it here tonight. The answer sheet is on top, let him copy it down on the blackboard.\u201dQin Ran took out a lollipop from the box. She slowly peeled it before putting it into her mouth. The sweet taste spread and the bitter taste in her mouth dissipated.She put the paper on Zhong Da\u2019s table.And found her own paper again.24 points.She just put the paper in the hole on the table, and as soon as she turned out of the classroom door, she saw the boy who had been leaning against the wall of the corridor.His thin lips were tight and his face was cold and arrogant.It was Mu Nan.\u201cFor you!\u201d Seeing Qin Ran, he stood upright and handed her a bunch of notebooks.Qin Ran sniffed and took it. Her voice hummed a little. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNotebook,\u201d Mu Nan said coldly.1Seeing that Qin Ran was careless, he added, \u201cI looked for Brother Song for this notebook. Didn\u2019t you say you wanted to go to Peking University?\u201d1Qin Ran\u2019s hand holding the notebook paused.She had said she wanted to go to Peking University. Ning Qing had taught her not to be impractical, and Qin Yu had been disdainful. Even aunt didn\u2019t seem to really believe her. Everyone probably thought that she was only joking.3She didn\u2019t expect Mu Nan to be so motivated.Qin Ran flipped through the notebook. It was a new ink color and was clearly noted down, having been reorganized by Mu Nan.She looked at Mu Nan\u2019s black eyes and squinted slightly. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t thank me, I wanted to organize Mu Ying\u2019s notebook,\u201d Mu Nan said with no expression. \u201cI just copied for you conveniently. Bye.\u201d1\u201cWait.\u201d Qin Ran smiled. She went into the classroom and placed the notebooks on her table before coming out.Mu Nan was still waiting for her at the entrance of the stairs.Today Qin Ran was walking slowly.Although her fever had already subsided, her face still had a slight abnormal flush.Mu Nan glanced at her several times, frowning.As soon as they left the school, a black Volkswagen happened to come in slowly.Mu Nan stepped aside and pulled Qin Ran\u2019s arm, but didn\u2019t expect that the Volkswagen car would take a turn and stop at the side of the road.\u201cHey\u2014\u201d The window lowered, and the person in the driver\u2019s seat showed his face. His earrings were extremely shiny. \u201cQin Ran, why are you out?\u201dThe man in the back seat squinted his eyes casually, and when he heard this, he opened his eyes suddenly.Lu Zhaoying looked at the rear-view mirror and touched his chin with a smile on his face.Cheng Juan put down his pillow, opened the door and walked out of the car.He gently glanced over Mu Nan, then lowered his head, looked at Qin Ran, and said very casually, \u201cYou\u2019re going out with your friend?\u201d\u201cNo, I wanted to give him something. You two can wait for me.\u201d Qin Ran asked Mu Nan to wait and then walked to the bubble tea shop opposite.Cheng Juan nodded expressionlessly.He leaned back, lowered his head slightly, glanced at Mu Nan, and raised his eyebrows lightly. Young Master Cheng was always proud and didn\u2019t speak.They both looked good.Cheng Juan, in particular. Yun Cheng was a slow-paced city and at night, the entire sunset was a little gentle, but because of his strong invasion, he added strong and vivid colors to it.Mu Ying and Li Yuhan, who just came out of the bubble tea shop, were stunned.Last time they had met it was at night, so Cheng Juan\u2019s appearance had been blurred by the lights. This time, however, the light was enough to shock Mu Ying.The most outstanding visual they had seen in reality was probably the campus king Xu Yaoguang, and then famous entertainment stars.There were naturally a lot of good looking people in the entertainment industry, but they all had a layer of filter across the screen.\u201cOh\u2026 my god.\u201d Li Yuhan finally reacted. Without even opening the milk tea cover, she pulled on Mu Ying\u2019s arm. \u201cThat\u2019s the new school doctor in the school medical office. I kept seeing posts saying that he was handsome, and it really is him. I finally get to see him alive!\u201dShe was agitated for a long time before she calmed down. \u201cWho is the guy next to him, he looks handsome too. He\u2019s wearing our school uniform as well. Oh my god, I\u2019ve never seen him before, could he be a freshman? Why are the freshmen so handsome this time?\u201d\u201cI know them. That\u2019s my brother Mu Nan, we are fraternal twins.\u201d Mu Ying took Li Yuhan\u2019s hand, her heart beating fast. \u201cI\u2019ll take you there.\u201d\u201cMu Nan.\u201d She took Li Yuhan and ran over. \u201cIs this your friend?\u201dMu Nan was always cold. He glanced at Mu Ying, nodded slightly, and didn\u2019t speak.He glanced again at the famous bubble tea shop.Qin Ran was very quick. She only went in for a minute and then came out.He and Cheng Juan both had very purposeful eyes. Mu Ying and Li Yuhan subconsciously looked over to the place.At a glance, they saw a girl wearing a large school uniform coming out. The girl was carrying a shopping bag in her hand, her eyebrows delicate.Mu Nan immediately crossed the street and helped her get the bag.He was cold and arrogant, exactly the same as described in the post, unapproachable.1\u201cCampus belle?\u201d Li Yuhan felt like she had gotten some good luck today.On the first day of school, she had managed to see all the important characters in school.Lu Zhaoying had been sitting in the driver\u2019s seat watching a movie.To be honest, it was the first time he saw Qin Ran being so tolerant to a boy. Forget that he was leaning so close to her, but he could even pull her by her hand.If it were him, Lu Zhaoying thought that she would break his arm.He watched as Young Master Cheng leaned against the car window and looked as Mu Nan helped her carry her bag naturally, expressionless.Lu Zhaoying couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He lowered the window of the driver\u2019s seat, looked out, looked at Qin Ran, and said with a smile, \u201cQin Ran, who are you to make us wait?\u201dHe glanced at Cheng Juan and sniggered, then turned to Mu Ying and smirked. \u201cDo you all know each other? That classmate is Qin Ran\u2019s boyfriend?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 no, that\u2019s my brother. Qin Ran is our cousin. She\u2019s three years older than us and only transferred to First Middle School this year.\u201d It was a rare opportunity to speak to him, so Mu Ying stuttered.\u201cOh, she\u2019s your relative, three years older?\u201d Lu Zhaoying glanced at Cheng Juan. After hearing that Mu Ying was her relative, his smile eased. \u201cDid you skip a grade?\u201dMu Ying shook her head and said very vaguely, \u201cNo\u2026 no, she retained a year, because\u2026 anyways, the school before didn\u2019t accept her, so she transferred over to First Middle School\u2026\u201dLiked it?

Her results should be quite good if she could come to our school. What trouble did she make so that the school didn\u2019t want her anymore?\u201d\u201cShe has a poor grade because she skips class every day and fights. She\u2019s almost the last in school. Later, the teacher stopped caring about her. She could come to First Middle School because\u2026\u201d Mu Ying looked at Qin Ran\u2019s direction and lowered her voice. \u201cAnyway\u2026 sigh, I won\u2019t say more about the specific reasons.\u201d4After she finished speaking, Li Yuhan thought deeply and looked anxious to gossip.Mu Ying couldn\u2019t help but look in the direction of Cheng Juan and Lu Zhaoying. Cheng Juan leaned quietly on the door, his expression relaxed while playing with his mobile phone.He had good-looking hands, long fingers, and clean fingertips. His knuckles were raised as he pinched his phone.6His eyebrows were slightly down, and it was still obvious he was looking in the direction of Qin Ran.He didn\u2019t even care what she was talking about.As for Lu Zhaoying, his hand was on the car window and he was chuckling. \u201cMaster Juan, I didn\u2019t expect Qin Ran to be so cool.\u201dThe reaction of the two was beyond Mu Ying\u2019s expectations. Mu Ying couldn\u2019t tell what they felt, so she just pursed her lips and stood there.9\u201cBring the bag back to my aunt. I bought it last night and didn\u2019t have time to bring it back. You can help me.\u201d Qin Ran returned and gave the bag to Mu Nan.After listening to this sentence, Mu Nan frowned.He wanted to say something, but he had always been quiet, so he just silently took it and turned around.Mu Ying didn\u2019t dare to look at Qin Ran. She whispered, \u201cCousin, I\u2019m going.\u201d3After Mu Nan and her left, Qin Ran got into the car, but the car didn\u2019t get to start.A little girl ran out of the bubble tea shop. Because she ran fast, her face was flushed, and she handed over a cup of bubble tea. \u201cQin Ran, thank you for helping me to work overtime last night.\u201dQin Ran leaned on the back of the chair and said without much energy, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dThe little girl hurried back to work again.Cheng Juan was sitting in the passenger seat. He leaned on the back of the chair and looked in the rear-view mirror. She was holding the bubble teacup and her complexion had improved a lot, but her spirit was still weak. \u201cYou work part-time at the bubble tea shop too?\u201dQin Ran poked the straw in and nodded.Cheng Juan raised his eyes. \u201cAre you short of money?\u201dHe thought of how Ning Qing had been decked out in famous brands. He didn\u2019t know the details of her family, but Ning Qing didn\u2019t look like she came from a family with a lack of money.\u201cYeah.\u201d Qin Ran nodded without any psychological burden.1Cheng Juan didn\u2019t speak.**The Lin family.The Lin family and Lin Jinxuan were at home tonight. Qin Yu had come back home directly as there was no self-study for her. First Middle School\u2019s self-study was primarily for the boarding students, so she was freer.At the dinner table, the Lin family mainly focused on three things. One was about Lin Jinxuan\u2019s recent busy work, the other was when Lin Wan would return to Beijing, and the last was the current situation of Qin Yu\u2019s learning.\u201cIs Feng Ci back?\u201d Lin Qi chatted with Lin Jinxuan casually.Lin Jinxuan nodded. \u201cThis time our project is in Yun Cheng. He will come back naturally.\u201dLin Qi patted his shoulder. \u201cDo well with him.\u201dThe Feng family was a real prestigious family in Yun Cheng. His father was the mayor, and the Lin family had a normal relationship with the Feng family. Even Lin Qi couldn\u2019t see the mayor easily.However, Lin Jinxuan had a close relationship with Feng Ci.Lin Wan also laughed. She gave Lin Jinxuan a piece of vegetable and said in a gentle voice, \u201cThe Feng family has a deep foundation. There won\u2019t be any big problems if the two of you cooperate.\u201d1Lin Jinxuan bowed his head. \u201cI know.\u201dAfter talking about Lin Jinxuan, the conversation turned to Qin Yu again.Lin Wan asked this question in more detail and learned that Qin Yu had done well in her exams, so she naturally was eager to praise her.\u201cThis was an ordinary test. It\u2019s useless to take ninth place.\u201d Qin Yu smiled and spoke humbly, but the pride in her voice couldn\u2019t be hidden.\u201cYou\u2019re just being humble.\u201d Lin Qi smiled happily.The atmosphere on the table was very good. Ning Qing sat next to Lin Qi, gave Lin Qi a piece of meat and smiled. Then, she called Aunt Zhang to bring another bowl of soup.She did it all with the aura of a hostess.Lin Wan glanced at her and put down her chopsticks.\u201cYu\u2019er, I heard that your elder sister is also in First Middle School. How is she doing?\u201d Lin Wan asked with a smile.Ning Qing\u2019s face froze.Qin Yu\u2019s expression remained unchanged. \u201cI\u2019m not in the same class as her, so I don\u2019t know clearly\u2026\u201d She paused. \u201cBut after seeing her score of 30 in English, I think sister just came here and might not be used to our school\u2019s learning methods. It\u2019ll be fine once she gets used to it.\u201d\u201cHah\u2014\u201d Lin Wan picked up a paper towel and wiped the corners of her mouth, her voice dull. \u201cThe education in Ninghai Village is really bad. Yu\u2019er, thank God you grew up in our Lin family.\u201d1Ning Qing\u2019s expression was even worse.After the meal, the people at the table went to do their own things.Qin Yu went upstairs to practice the violin. The violin score was still in front of her, and she played it several times.Although the song was good, Qin Yu really couldn\u2019t pull off the emotions behind it.She sat on the chair for a long while and locked the score in the drawer again. Although the song was good, it was too time-consuming to practice it, so she didn\u2019t plan to practice it again.2The study room was also on the second floor.\u201cWhen are you going to return to Beijing?\u201d Lin Qi poured a cup of tea for Lin Wan and said gently.Lin Wan pressed her temples, looking tired. \u201cTwo days later.\u201d\u201cJust know when you have to leave.\u201d Lin Qi nodded.Lin Wan took up the teacup and took a sip. \u201cAbout Teacher Wei, I listened to the violin played by Yu\u2019er yesterday, and I think she basically only plays songs that everyone already knows.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s still young.\u201d Lin Qi laughed. \u201cShe can\u2019t compose yet.\u201d\u201cTeacher Wei likes apprentices with their own spirits. This kind of popular music can\u2019t impress him. I\u2019ll settle the quota and let Yu\u2019er concentrate fully on composing. There\u2019s still some time left, it\u2019s completely doable.\u201d Lin Wan put down her teacup and said slowly, \u201cI\u2019ll take her to Beijing for a few days. Old Master would surely like it.\u201d\u201cJust as you have planned.\u201d Lin Qi had no opinion. For so many years, he also regarded Qin Yu as his biological daughter.The atmosphere on both sides was good.Ning Qing, who was walking into the room with her mobile phone, was iron-blue, on the other hand.Lin Wan indeed played her weight at night. When Lin Wan came back, Aunt Zhang and the rest all basically revolved around her.Ning Qing was uneasy.She pulled out a phone number in the phone book and pressed it directly.**Lu Zhaoying continued to order meals at En Yu Hotel in the evening.Qin Ran wanted to thank the two for their warm help at noon in the evening but didn\u2019t expect that Lu Zhaoying didn\u2019t give her the opportunity to at all.Cheng Juan only asked her to sit and take a good rest, and then took his thermometer to measure her temperature. When he saw that her fever was almost gone, he poured her a glass of water and then sat down on the sofa.Qin Ran took a sip. It still had a touch of sweetness.Noon hadn\u2019t been an illusion.She felt inexplicably better.She held the cup and watched Cheng Juan and Lu Zhaoying. Although these two were capitalists, they were simply too good as bosses. Since they didn\u2019t let her work, Qin Ran wanted to make it up in other ways.She sniffed and looked at Cheng Juan, wanting to say something when her cell phone happened to ring.It was Ning Qing\u2019s voice. It sounded irritable, and it seemed to be suppressing some anger that had nowhere to go, so she took the liberty to vent all of it onto her. \u201cQin Ran, why aren\u2019t you learning well even in First Middle School? How could you score 30 points, I can\u2019t even buy over any school with this score! Do you know that at today\u2019s dining table\u2026\u201dQin Ran had very little contact with Ning Qing.Her head had already been throbbing, and the sudden sharp voice made her veins tighten and she coughed two times before saying emotionlessly, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any other damn thing to say, I\u2019m hanging up.\u201dIf possible, Ning Qing would also like to ignore her, but she was her own daughter. Outsiders would always point at her and say, Look, that\u2019s Ning Qing\u2019s daughter, the last place.She breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cFrom this week on, I\u2019ve found a few teachers for you. You can go to tuition classes obediently. You will go once you\u2019re on vacation, and don\u2019t make trouble everywhere\u2026\u201dShe didn\u2019t finish talking.Because Qin Ran had hung up the phone.Putting away the phone, Qin Ran leaned back and tilted her head. Her good-looking eyes were squinted and looked quite arrogant. \u201cDo you have another computer?\u201dLiked it?

He just put down his things and brought a computer over to her.When Qin Ran took over the computer, he asked, \u201cWho was it, sounded like a bitch.\u201d1Qin Ran\u2019s cold fingertips swiped across the computer. The corners of her lips weren\u2019t smiling and revealed a bit of casual coldness.This matter wasn\u2019t complicated to explain, so Qin Ran explained why she had come to Yun Cheng succinctly.It was quite brief, but Cheng Juan understood the main parts.He looked at Qin Ran for a while and then said, \u201cYour mother is your biological mother?\u201dQin Ran\u2019s voice sounded wrong and she was still weak and coughing. Cheng Juan stopped looking at his documents and kept staring at her to check on her condition.He frowned at the thought of how Ning Qing didn\u2019t even ask about him.1This sentence made Qin Ran smile and she was quite happy. \u201cYeah, she is.\u201dQin Ran\u2019s USB flash drive was with him.She stood up, looked around the room, and took the computer to the tatami mat near the window.Cheng Juan\u2019s computer had a spy screen, and this place was a dead end. Unless he stood behind her, he wouldn\u2019t be able to see what she was doing.She opened the USB flash drive and started work casually. She hadn\u2019t taken orders for more than a year.1Cheng Juan was preparing for his Sunday operation, but he still couldn\u2019t calm down. He looked at the words he had written down on the paper. He knew them, but he couldn\u2019t pierce together the meaning.He tilted his head back and looked at the girl sitting on the tatami mat. She was still wrapped in a shirt, and her face didn\u2019t look as relaxed as usual. Her expression was a little more serious than he had ever seen before. He squinted slightly and didn\u2019t know what she was doing, but her whole body seemed to be glowing.He moved his hands.After a short while, he turned to find a cup, poured a cup of warm water, and put a few pills beside it.While he did it, Qin Ran\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t even deviate slightly.After work at this time, Lu Zhaoying went back to the gate of the yard and picked up the meal that En Yu Hotel had just delivered.He originally wanted to call Qin Ran but was interrupted by Cheng Juan\u2019s gaze.\u201cThen we\u2019ll eat later.\u201d Lu Zhaoying placed the two wooden boxes on the table. \u201cMaster Juan, have you arranged for the surgery on Sunday?\u201dHe came over and looked at the notebook in Cheng Juan\u2019s hand.Damn it, it was still the same as at noon.Lu Zhaoying was curious. \u201cMaster Juan, why haven\u2019t you finished it?\u201dCheng Juan glanced at him. His good-looking fingers hit the table and he said concisely, \u201cNo time.\u201dLu Zhaoying: \u201c\u2026\u201dQin Ran finished her work. It was already ten minutes after dinner. She ate and took her medicine, before looking around the school medical office and tidying the things that needed to be tidied.As soon as she was about to leave, her sleeves were tugged on by Cheng Juan.If it had been somewhere else, or someone else, she would probably frown or break their hands impatiently.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d At this time, Qin Ran\u2019s mood was rather good.She turned sideways, looked at Cheng Juan, and narrowed her eyes casually.\u201cBring this cup. The cup is new and no one has used it.\u201d Cheng Juan passed her the thermos cup she had just drunk from. He was a little lazy and his eyes were dark. He paused for a while before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re a girl, don\u2019t always drink cold water.\u201dWhen Qin Ran came to the school\u2019s medical office, she always carried a bottle of mineral water or a can of cola.Cheng Juan had observed this many times. She was his patient and was ill, so it was only right to be concerned about her.Qin Ran took it and glanced at it. The white cup looked pretty.Cheng Juan touched her fingertips, and after the temperature dropped, her fingers became cold.He quietly retracted his hand.\u201cThank you.\u201d Qin Ran waved her hand at Cheng Juan.Cheng Juan looked at her leaving figure, then raised his hand in a complicated way and looked at it for a long time.\u201cMy Master Juan, what are you looking at? We should go.\u201d Lu Zhaoying came over.Cheng Juan retracted his hand, got up, and looked expressionless. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d**Qin Ran returned to class to study by herself.Her evening self-study was reading a book and copying papers.She put away the notes that Mu Nan had given her and began to sort through her papers.She put the test papers one by one from small to large according to the score, and then put it back in satisfaction.She began to look through a foreign book that had not been translated.\u201cAh, ah, I love Doudou\u2019s new album, and it will be on sale tomorrow morning at nine!\u201d Lin Siran\u2019s voice beside her was still very loud, even if it was deliberately suppressed.Fortunately, classes had already ended, so her voice wasn\u2019t abrupt.She shook Qin Ran\u2019s arm. \u201cRan Ran, look at him, he\u2019s so handsome.\u201dQin Ran glanced at the screen. It was a magnified young man in a black punk outfit with thick eye makeup that looked very casual on him.His eyebrows looked pretty and were considered very outstanding in the entertainment industry.1\u201cDo you know him, he is\u2026\u201d Lin Siran was very excited to popularize her idol to Qin Ran.\u201cYanxi,\u201d Qin Ran propped her legs up and said casually.\u201cRan Ran, are you a fan too?\u201d Lin Siran brightened up.Qin Ran was expressionless. \u201cNo.\u201d1Lin Siran wasn\u2019t disappointed and was very enthusiastic about selling her love for him to Qin Ran instead. \u201cIn three years, he has become popular all over the country. The songs he sings are all magical\u2026\u201dQin Ran took out a lollipop, peeled it, and put it directly into her mouth.Lin Siran: \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter self-study class, Qin Ran and Lin Siran returned to the bedroom.Their bedroom was at the end of the corridor, so they passed by Pan Mingyue\u2019s bedroom.Pan Mingyue had returned early and had cooked a bottle of boiling water. A pretty girl blocked her dormitory door.\u201cPan Mingyue, why did you add twenty points to your college entrance examination? Are you a minority?\u201d The girl had a shawl in her hair and squinted at Pan Mingyue.Pan Mingyue lowered her head and didn\u2019t talk nor look at her.\u201cForget it. Jiang Han, don\u2019t make a mess, the host is coming.\u201d Another girl held the talking girl.Jiang Han put aside her hand and was a bit arrogant. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I talk? She and Xu Yaoguang are always about twenty points apart from each other, and Teacher Li already said that she added twenty points and has a good chance of getting champion. Pan Mingyue, tell us yourself. We\u2019re all humans, are you one class higher?\u201dSeveral people stood in the way and blocked the side road. Several passing girls didn\u2019t dare to lift their heads and just walked past them.Qin Ran didn\u2019t go around them. She lowered her head and said concisely, \u201cMake way, it\u2019s troublesome.\u201dHer eyes were pale and reddish, and she weighed the cup in her hand.Jiang Han froze. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dThis Jiang Han was quite a troublemaker in First Middle School. Seeing this scene, the girls who wanted to get water in the corridor quickly returned to their dormitory. Unless they were passing by, no one dared to step forward.She was Xu Yaoguang\u2019s number one fangirl and didn\u2019t dare to provoke Qin Yu, so she could only express her anger in other ways.Qin Ran looked up and smiled, but her tone wasn\u2019t very good, so the evil spirits in her eyes almost rushed out. It was suppressed again and she closed her eyes. \u201cI said, make way. Good dogs don\u2019t block the way.\u201dJiang Han looked at the girl who dared to talk to her in this way. She was unfamiliar, with white skin and a good-looking face. It was very hot, but she was wearing a jacket and even had her clothes pulled up high like an obedient student.Lin Siran didn\u2019t respond. She looked at Qin Ran and didn\u2019t even have time to say anything.There were many small enterprises in the school and Jiang Han was naturally from such a family too. Her father was an upstart and had donated a library. Her results were rather good as well, so she was in class 3.1.1\u201cWhich class are you from? Don\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d Jiang Han\u2019s eyes became amused and a little disdainful. The few girls behind her surrounded her instantly and she sneered. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for death\u2014\u201dQin Ran let Lin Siran take her cup.Lin Siran came back to her senses. \u201cRan Ran, what are you doing? Don\u2019t rush\u2026\u201d In the school, few girls dared to provoke Jiang Han.Qin Ran reached out and took off her school uniform jacket. Inside was a white T-shirt. She put the school uniform jacket in Lin Siran\u2019s hand, squinted, and said calmly, \u201cWe\u2019ll attack together and save time.\u201dLiked it?

Her pupils shrank and she tried to take a step back, wanting to escape!However, before Jiang Han could take a step back, her whole person was strangled by a huge force, and she was severely thrown against the wall by her neck.There was almost no strength in the body.Qin Ran held onto Jiang Han with one hand, stretched her legs and knocked the other two girls to the ground. She looked at the last girl, raised an eyebrow, and smiled. \u201cDo you want a taste of this too?\u201d2Girls and boys of this age were unscrupulous in their actions, and in Qin Ran\u2019s eyes, they were just easy targets.\u201cStop fighting.\u201d Behind, someone pulled her sleeve.It was Pan Mingyue.Qin Ran didn\u2019t speak. She just looked down at Jiang Han expressionlessly.Jiang Han\u2019s eyebrows were cold and sweaty. The girl in front had her hair tied up, and a few strands of hair fell to the side of her face and stopped at her mouth.Her eyes were pretty, but her pupils looked blood-stained. Her stare was scary and made people feel goosebumps.Everyone in the other bedroom knew about this change.Wu Yan was also a little scared, but she glanced at Jiang Han and the others, stood by the door and said, \u201cQin Ran, don\u2019t go crazy. I\u2019m going to find the host\u2026\u201dQin Ran opened the next door.\u201cPa\u2014\u201dWhen the door hit the wall, it bounced back fiercely with a loud noise.Not only Wu Yan was afraid to speak, but the entire floor was also silent.Qin Ran was a little taller than Jiang Han. She let go of the hand that was against her neck, lowered her head slightly, and smiled softly.After a long while, under Jiang Han\u2019s frightening and somewhat strange eyes, she let go of her hands and slowly put down her rolled-up sleeves.She went to get her cup back from Lin Siran.Still with bloodshot eyes, before she left, she turned slightly and smiled wickedly at Jiang Han. \u201cMind your own business and eat more.\u201dShe took the cup and walked to her bedroom without any rush.The remaining girls standing in the corridor were like frightened white rabbits, jumping to make way for her.Almost all the girls in the hallway shrank into the bedroom door and watched her enter the room. She was the first girl who dared to mess with Jiang Han.For a few minutes, none of them were able to come to their senses and were extremely quiet.After Lin Siran took a shower, she didn\u2019t see Qin Ran in the dormitory. She frowned and didn\u2019t see her until she came to the balcony.She saw Qin Ran sitting on the balcony with her back to her, her legs dangling slightly.Lin Siran was so scared that her heart suddenly stopped. \u201cRan Ran!\u201dQin Ran had heard her noise and she squinted slightly, her eyes narrowing. \u201cWhat are you panicking for?\u201dThere was still an unlit cigarette in her mouth, and she dangled her legs carelessly. The night scene soaked through her as she thought about something.Lin Siran didn\u2019t respond.Qin Ran suddenly laughed in a low voice. She stretched out her hand, jumped back, and threw the cigarette into the trash bin. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to sleep.\u201dLin Siran touched her heart and breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cRan Ran, you were so impressive.\u201dShe was referring to what had happened just now.She had really never seen any girl make Jiang Han shudder to that extent.Qin Ran went to the bedroom, her hands behind her head. She didn\u2019t say anything.It took a long time for Lin Siran to hear her four words, thin and cold. \u201cI\u2019m not a God.\u201d**A villa somewhere in Yun Cheng.Cheng Juan was holding a knife and studying the mannequin.He heard Lu Zhaoying opening the door in a panic. \u201cMaster Juan, Master Juan, there\u2019s\u2026 there\u2019s\u2026\u201dCheng Juan turned expressionlessly, pointed his thin scalpel at Lu Zhaoying and tilted his head. \u201cCan you afford my mannequin if you break it?\u201dLu Zhaoying was silent.Young Master Cheng had spent five million customizing human body models, and even the blood vessels had been simulated clearly. He could afford it, but whether or not he could find someone to help customize the human body models was another thing\u2026He paused, then said, \u201cThe order was returned\u2026\u201d1Cheng Juan retracted his dagger. A gust of wind raised the corner of his shirts gently. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d1Lu Zhaoying: \u201c\u2026\u201d**Although it was senior year, First Middle School didn\u2019t have supplementary classes during the holidays. They had it previously, but after some students\u2019 parents reported it to the Education Bureau, they stopped entirely.In the past two days, Qin Ran was free except for when she went for her part-time job at the bubble tea shop.Early Saturday morning, Ning Qing called her several times in a row, but she didn\u2019t answer.Qin Ran took her backpack and went directly to the hospital to see Chen Shulan.Chen Shulan lived in the VIP ward of the hospital and had special care. When Qin Ran arrived, her aunt was feeding Chen Shulan soup.Mu Ying was sitting on a side chair playing with her mobile phone.Mu Nan sat on the other side cutting an apple with a fruit knife.Qin Ran went in immediately but stood outside the glass window looking at Chen Shulan for a while.Chen Shulan had married her grandfather early but had her children late. She had her first child in her thirties.She was now close to eighty.As people get older, their organs begin to degenerate, and various diseases would then appear.Qin Ran had ways to help Ning Wei\u2019s legs, but in the face of natural death, illnesses, and various organ failures, even Qin Ran was helpless.Qin Ran opened the door and went in. Chen Shulan\u2019s spirit improved immediately.\u201cRan Ran, I asked your mother to bring these things. Keep them.\u201d Chen Shulan\u2019s fingers were shaking and unstable as she took out a pile of papers from under the pillow and handed it to Qin Ran.Qin Ran looked down. The pile of papers was notes that she had crumpled into the trash before.All written casually.She didn\u2019t expect her grandmother to pick it up and keep it well.Seeing that she had no reaction, Chen Shulan couldn\u2019t help but pull Qin Ran\u2019s hand and shove the papers into her hand. Chen Shulan was old and had a bad memory, but she still remembered how the imperial capital\u2019s teacher had looked at these notes.Like they were a gem.If it had been another parent, they would definitely have forced their child to learn.But Chen Shulan was different. She would be happy even if Qin Ran didn\u2019t get married, so all those were just trivial matters.\u201cCousin, what\u2019s this?\u201d When Mu Ying saw Qin Ran coming, she put her phone back and came over.1She only saw the paper.And couldn\u2019t see clearly what was written.Qin Ran rolled up the papers and stuffed it into her school uniform pocket. \u201cNothing.\u201dShe said lightly.Although Mu Ying was curious, she didn\u2019t ask much and just felt strange.They accompanied Chen Shulan at the hospital till noon, and only when Qin Ran left to work at the bubble tea shop did she leave too.**On Saturday, Qin Yu still came to school to practice the violin.Qin Yu had a performance on the school anniversary.On weekdays, the driver usually sent her. This time, however, Lin Wan wanted to see Qin Yu off personally, so he followed along, and Ning Qing could only accompany them.1The car could enter the campus on Saturday.But when they passed by the door, Qin Yu wanted to drink milk tea.All three got out of the car.The driver came down to queue for Qin Yu to buy milk tea.Qin Yu took Lin Wan\u2019s arm, smiled and introduced her to the current situation in First Middle School.Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a familiar figure at the bubble tea shop. Qin Yu was stunned for a moment.COMMENTLin Wan noticed that Qin Yu had a strange expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dShe asked, following her gaze.\u201cMom, why is sister here?\u201d Qin Yu glanced at Ning Qing.Ning Qing had already seen her. She was pale and pursed her lips, before striding over to the bubble tea shop with frosty eyes.Qin Ran leaned on the bar side, her head lowered and calmly putting a cup of bubble tea on the table.Ning Qing clenched her fingers tightly. She clutched her 30,000 yuan bag and gritted her teeth. \u201cQin Ran, what are you doing? Did I not give you money?\u201d1Liked it?

She took a new teacup and said directly, \u201cDon\u2019t disturb me at work.\u201dAt the mention of this, Ning Qing folded her arms tighter.\u201cWork? What are you working for? Have I treated you badly?\u201d Ning Qing\u2019s turned pale, but at the thought that Lin Wan was still outside, she swallowed her saliva and suppressed her anger. \u201cI\u2019ve arranged tuition for you, yet you didn\u2019t go. In the end, you\u2019re working part-time here. Qin Ran, who are you showing off to? Have I neglected you?!3\u201cWith your grades, even Zi High School might not want you. Now that you\u2019re in First Middle School, why can\u2019t you just study properly?!\u201cTidy up your things and go to tuition with me,\u201d Ning Qing said, and when Qin Ran ignored her, she turned to another part-timer and said indiscriminately, \u201cWhere is your boss, let him come over.\u201dHer tone was arrogant and high.The other part-timer had never seen this happen before.She looked at Ning Qing\u2019s branded stuff, and then at Qin Ran, who wore her school uniform jacket every day. She was a little awkward but felt like Ning Qing wasn\u2019t easy to provoke.\u201cQin Ran, just go back with your mother.\u201d The part-timer tried to persuade. \u201cIt\u2019s your mother, after all, she must be doing it for your good\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can there be hatred between mother and daughter.\u201d\u201cMy little son can\u2019t even attend First Middle School. You\u2019re in there but are still so ungrateful.\u201d Someone felt sour.\u201cChildren these years have bad grades and don\u2019t even attend tuition, then they come to work instead\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so young and yet such a troublemaker. Sigh, it must be hard on your mother\u2026\u201d3Several onlookers pointed out one by one.In their traditional view, parents could have no fault.The surrounding finger-pointing seemed to give Ning Qing courage. She reached out to pull Qin Ran\u2026Her hand just reached out.\u201cSnap\u2014\u201dA bony joint with a sharp hand knocked her down.2Ning Qing looked up immediately and saw a clean and handsome face. The teenager was fresh and his movements weren\u2019t rude. He said calmly, \u201cIf you wanted to control her, shouldn\u2019t you have done it ten years ago?\u201dNing Qing\u2019s mind was emptied for a moment.Wei Zihang didn\u2019t plan to just let it go. He bit his cigarette, turned around, and pointed at Ning Qing. \u201cThis person got divorced when her daughter was seven years old, and then she married a wealthy man. She refused to bring her daughter back. In twelve years, she never came back once. Do you guys still think she is a mother?\u201d2\u201cBut\u2026 if I didn\u2019t care about her, why would I help her study in First Middle School\u2026\u201d\u201cSpeaking of this, I want to ask more.\u201d Wei Zihang looked at Ning Qing and suddenly smiled, but his eyes were cold. \u201cI remember that Principal Xu already let Sister Qin attend First Middle School one year ago. Aunt Ning, I want to ask you, why do you have to make it seem like Sister Qin could only attend school because of your family?\u201dThere was silence at this moment.For a while, Ning Qing didn\u2019t know what to say. She was pale, her head was empty, and she acted mechanically.Wei Zihang chuckled. \u201cSpeaking of that, Sister Qin is already so big and you\u2019ve never even taken care of her before. Forget that you took advantage of her, now you\u2019re still pointing at her and criticizing her?\u201dAt this moment, the onlookers no longer looked at Qin Ran. Instead, they were all pointing at Ning Qing.Having a step-father meant having a step-mother. Which biological mother wouldn\u2019t go to see her daughter for twelve years?Ning Qing didn\u2019t expect things to turn to this.In these twelve years, she had never experienced such a dilemma.Everyone was looking and pointing at her while gossiping, making her feel uncomfortable.Soon someone recognized the 30,000 yuan bag in her hand and then they started discussing Qin Ran\u2019s clothes. Ning Qing saw someone hold up her mobile phone and lowered her head and quickly walked out of the tea shop.Qin Ran\u2019s expression remained unchanged from beginning to end.Another clerk recognized Wei Zihang and lowered her head in horror, afraid to say a word.Her hands holding onto money were shaking.Ning Qing went out.Lin Wan smirked.Ning Qing clutched her handbag and didn\u2019t look at Lin Wan.\u201cHow did my sister know him?\u201d Qin Yu whispered.\u201cWhy?\u201d Lin Wan only tilted her head slightly and let Qin Yu take her arm.Qin Yu looked at Wei Zihang\u2019s direction in a complicated way. Wei Zihang was well known and hardly anyone dared to mess with him, but they all discussed his appearance in private.\u201cThat\u2019s the famous school bully of Zi High School next door. They don\u2019t do honorable business, and I heard that he\u2019s even related to the underworld,\u201d Qin Yu whispered.Ning Qing\u2019s expression was even worse.Lin Wan glanced at Ning Qing, smiled slightly and nodded her head. She raised her eyebrows and spoke thoughtfully, \u201cYu\u2019er, that person said that Qin Ran managed to attend First Middle School not because of your father?\u201dQin Yu also looked at Wei Zihang\u2019s direction. Her hands paused and she returned to her senses and said, \u201cBack then, First Middle School didn\u2019t accept Sister. We all know how her grades are\u2026 but I heard that Principal Xu went to Ninghai Village to help the poor out before and three years ago, an incident happened there. I guess Principal Xu took pity on her.\u201dAs soon as Lin Wan heard this, she thought for a moment and didn\u2019t ask anymore.Qin Ran didn\u2019t look like someone who was associated with First Middle School\u2019s Principal.They went to see Qin Yu\u2019s performance. Qin Yu\u2019s charisma was really good. She was young yet played the violin well.Lin Wan also knew music and naturally understood it.She would return to Beijing in a few days.She thought about it and pulled Qin Yu aside after her performance.\u201cAunt?\u201d Qin Yu said in surprise.Lin Wan pondered for a while and said, \u201cI\u2019ve found a violin teacher for you, an international master. I can\u2019t tell you his name for the time being, but he has a high apprenticeship and likes students with their own spirits. It\u2019s best that you take some original music to him. A few months later, you will have a chance to perform in front of him, do you understand?\u201d3Qin Yu didn\u2019t respond.Her heart was beating like a drum. What was Lin Wan\u2019s identity now? The family she married into was also a little famous in Beijing. How amazing would the violin teacher be if even she was full of high praises?Qin Yu was well aware of her foundation. This kind of teacher was sure to be demanding. She could write her own music, but it might not be what he wanted\u20261\u201cYu\u2019er?\u201d Qin Yu didn\u2019t speak for a while, and Lin Wan called her again.Qin Yu was a little absentminded. She remembered the musical notation locked by her in the drawer. After a while, she looked up, her eyes glowing like a torch, and said certainly, \u201cAunt, thank you. I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d3She clenched her fists.**The bubble tea shop wasn\u2019t far away.Cheng Juan bit a cigarette in his mouth. He didn\u2019t light it and his face was expressionless. His eyes were droopy and frosty. \u201cLu Zhaoying, you\u2019d better have something urgent.\u201dLu Zhaoying looked at Cheng Juan with an expression of resentment. How anxious could he be?!The beauty had already been saved by the hero!If you were in a TV show you would be the second male lead!4The idiot who only knew how to give!The one that couldn\u2019t survive past three episodes!1He wanted to vomit, but there was something more strange now. Lu Zhaoying turned and repeated what had happened to Cheng Juan. Then, he tutted. \u201cMaster Juan, it\u2019s been so many years and so many people have fallen into Elder Xu\u2019s hands. But when have you seen Elder Xu being so compassionate to give a letter of recommendation?\u201cElder Xu said last time that he had found a successor. Do you remember?\u201dLiked it?

It wasn\u2019t clear what he was thinking.Lu Zhaoying repeated himself, thinking that he wasn\u2019t listening.Only then did Cheng Juan turn towards him, brows furrowed. \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d1Lu Zhaoying was speechless. He missed the point!Cheng Juan hung his head lower with the cigarette in his mouth. \u201cThe huge murder case three years back, Boss Xu was around.\u201dLu Zhaoying was stunned and confused. \u201cWhat have you found?\u201d\u201cSpeculation.\u201d Cheng Juan puffed a ball of smoke as his eyes deepened. \u201cBoss Xu isn\u2019t that sympathetic. Something\u2019s been off since he arrived at Ninghai Village.\u201d\u201cSo, regarding the successor\u2026\u201d Lu Zhaoying looked up all of a sudden.Cheng Juan smiled. \u201cTwo possibilities. One, it\u2019s a smokescreen. Given Boss Xu\u2019s status and background, even if he does have a successor in mind, it\u2019s not likely that he\u2019d pass it on to an outsider at the expense of the Xu family\u2019s interests.\u201cTwo, there actually is a successor that he\u2019s willing to give up huge interests for. He made the move to look for us and even mentioned it. He\u2019s probably asking for my help. If this is the case, the capital city might undergo reshuffling, and by then this \u2018successor\u2019 might not even make it out of it.\u201d\u201cIt indeed is much easier to keep someone alive in the Cheng family than in the Xu family.\u201d Lu Zhaoying hadn\u2019t thought of this point; he\u2019d never been good at deducing such complex issues. He smiled. \u201cThen, something\u2019s wrong with this. Qin Ran should be that lucky survivor. Boss Xu couldn\u2019t possibly have his eyes on someone like her, right?\u201dCheng Juan did not respond. There was still a key point he couldn\u2019t figure out.What role did Qin Ran play exactly in all of this?It was very odd that someone like Boss Xu would personally give a student a recommendation letter.He puffed some more smoke and looked towards the milk tea store. \u201cIf he really has his eye on someone as a successor, things are going to change drastically.\u201dConsidering Boss Xu\u2019s status, Lu Zhaoying only just realized how important this matter was.He looked up as if wanting to say something more, but saw that Cheng Juan had already entered the store.It was the weekend, but the store wasn\u2019t especially crowded. Qin Ran had Wei Ziheng wait by the side.She placed a cup of milk tea on the table and smelt a familiar refreshing scent with hints of peppermint.1She looked up and saw Cheng Juan with one hand on the bar counter. He was tall and often had to look down at people. Even with his default expression, his gaze carried an air of oppression.He looked at the long list of menu items and furrowed his brows. It was evident that he hadn\u2019t drunk from such stores before. \u201cGive me a cup of something nice.\u201dHe took his card out to swipe for payment.Qin Ran looked at it and guessed that Master Cheng had probably never lived like a normal human being. Everyone either paid with cash or by digital payment, who would use a limited edition card for such a small amount?1She pressed his hand down. \u201cIt\u2019s on me.\u201dCheng Juan did not respond to that. He simply looked down at his hand and her fair, slender fingers. She had a beautiful hand, except that her fingers were not much cared for.Her fingertips were cool, but somehow it felt warm against his skin.He looked up politely and saw that Qin Ran had her eyes on the cups and toppings to prepare his drink.She looked so focused, with one hand holding the cup and the other busy with getting the toppings. She stirred the fruit tea with a spoon, but without touching the walls of the cup.The cup was clear and had a logo printed on it. The fruit tea filled about two-thirds of the cup and was then carefully topped with freshly whipped cream. Finally, some cocoa powder was sifted over it.Qin Ran was always serious and conscientious when she did something she deemed important. She usually appeared cold and unapproachable, but whenever she was engrossed in an activity, the armor that she usually donned instant fell apart.Even her lashes were pointing downwards at a perfect angle.\u201cThank you,\u201d he said as he received the two cups of tea.As he walked to the side, his subconsciously tightened his grip on the cup.1**The Feng household.\u201cMingyue, you should eat more. How\u2019s school, are you getting used to staying on campus yet?\u201d Feng Loucheng scooped a lot of food into Pan Mingyue\u2019s bowl.\u201cThank you, Uncle Feng,\u201d Pan Mingyue quietly said. \u201cMy classmates are all really nice.\u201d\u201cYour Brother Feng is home too. In that case, don\u2019t return to school this weekend. Stay home and have Aunt whip up more delicacies for you.\u201d Feng Loucheng smiled.He was usually quiet and shrewd, a man of few words. It seemed like he had given all his kindness and patience to this girl here.Madam Feng tossed her chopsticks on the table. \u201cI\u2019m done eating.\u201dShe then stormed upstairs in her heels.Feng Ci furrowed his brows.Pan Mingyue tightened her grip on her chopsticks and smiled at Feng Loucheng. \u201cUncle Feng, I\u2019ll be having my exam soon. I should get back to school to do my revision.\u201d\u201cYour aunt is just like that.\u201d Feng Loucheng looked at Pan Mingyue and sighed. \u201cMingyue, you\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle, I\u2019m done eating too. I\u2019ll go get my clothes.\u201d Pan Mingyue finished the food that Feng Loucheng had scooped for her and headed upstairs too.Her room was pretty nicely decorated. As she opened the wardrobe, there weren\u2019t many clothes inside.The clothes were mostly from when she was younger. Feng Loucheng was a man, after all, he didn\u2019t quite know how to take care of her in all aspects. However, he\u2019d transfer money into her account every month, though she wouldn\u2019t touch a cent of it.But she did not mind.She took the clothes that were there and went downstairs.From a corner, she could hear Feng Ci talking to Feng Loucheng.Feng Ci had put his chopsticks down too and was wiping his mouth with a napkin. \u201cDad, it\u2019s not just Mom who wants to know, I want to know too. Who exactly is Mingyue? Why did you just bring her home all of a sudden and treat her so well? Is she your bastard child from outside, or the daughter or your first love?\u201d\u201cWhy are you just like your mom?!\u201d Feng Loucheng hurled the chopsticks. He looked at Feng Ci sternly and said, \u201cFeng Ci, don\u2019t you ever speak like this before Mingyue.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019d better not be your daughter. But I want to know, even if her parents are both deceased, she should have relatives who would take care of her. Why are you taking this upon yourself?\u201d Feng Ci lit a cigarette.In the corner, Pan Mingyue held her head low.She went downstairs to say goodbye to Feng Loucheng. Madam Feng had never liked her, but she\u2019d never abused her either. Moreover, Feng Loucheng was really treating her like she was his own.\u201cBe careful on your way.\u201d Feng Loucheng cooled down immediately and spoke to her nicely.Feng Ci watched as Pan Mingyue left. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly it. You\u2019re way too nice to Mingyue, this isn\u2019t how you usually are. If you want Mom to treat Mingyue better, then you\u2019d better explain things to her.\u201d1**The weekend passed very quickly.Monday\u2019s last period was a class meeting. Gao Yang spoke confidently about life lessons before taking a sip of tea. \u201cIs anyone volunteering to do up the minutes for today\u2019s meeting?\u201dNobody raised their hands. In Year 3, nobody really wanted to take on extra responsibilities.Gao Yang casually appointed someone. \u201cLin Siran, you write pretty well. You\u2019ll be in charge this time.\u201dQin Ran was half-leaning against the wall, still recovering from her flu. Her deskmate quietly agreed.She felt that her deskmate was simply too nice.After they were done with the miscellaneous discussions, there was only 10 minutes of class time left. Gao Yang got them to do their revision.Qin Ran unwrapped a lollipop and put it in her mouth.She sucked on it as she read her materials.Out of nowhere, the loud clicking of high heels could be heard arriving at the front door of the Ninth Class. Then came a shrill lady\u2019s voice. \u201cGao Yang, what\u2019s with Qin Ran from your class? What does she think she\u2019s doing in First Middle School? Creating trouble? If she affects my class\u2019s studies, will she be able to compensate for disrupting their future?\u201dLiked it?

At that point, her impression of Qin Ran was ruined.When she heard reports of Qin Ran\u2019s fight with Jiang Han, she angrily rushed to the Ninth Class. \u201cMr. Gao, I\u2019ve already told you a long time ago that we can\u2019t keep this student. Is school a place where she can do as she please? Do you see other students acting like her?\u201dThe whole class turned to look at her.Qin Ran calmly flipped through a book. She leaned slightly against the wall, slightly lowered her eyes and it seemed that she did not care at all.\u201cMs. Li, this could possibly be a misunderstanding. Qin Ran is not an unreasonable student. We should clarify matters first\u2026\u201d Gao Yang frowned slightly, walked to the door and adjusted his glasses.\u201cMisunderstanding? What sort of misunderstanding can there be? Mr. Gao, I\u2019m just about done with you. If you don\u2019t want your class to learn well, I want my class to do well during the exams. I will look for the principal regarding this matter, but I have to trouble you to inform Qin Ran\u2019s parents to come over,\u201d Li Airong said as she looked at the girl who was sitting down and flipping through a book.Li Airong contemptuously remarked. \u201cMr. Gao, you don\u2019t have to say anything. Save it for when you speak to the principal.\u201dTurning around, she walked off in her high heels.Gradually, some people started whispering in a low voice.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Qin Ran fought with Jiang Han? She doesn\u2019t seem like someone who would fight with others,\u201d someone whispered.\u201cWhat do you mean? Who do you think would look like someone who would get into a fight then?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. Haven\u2019t you heard? In the past when Qin Ran did something illegal, even the police were shocked.\u201d\u201cReally? What did she do?\u201dThere was a commotion in the initially quiet classroom due to this matter.\u201cDidn\u2019t Jiang Han tell you why we fought?\u201d Qin Ran put down the book, stood up and looked at Li Airong with eyes blazing with anger.3Li Airong did not expect her to speak and was slightly startled. She sneered. \u201cA fight is a fight. What\u2019s there to explain?\u201d\u201cYou are right. There is nothing to explain. Ms. Li, do you care about your students?\u201d Qin Ran glanced at Gao Yang and did not give him a chance to speak first.\u201cOf course I care about my students. They all want to excel in their exams and get into a good school.\u201d Li Airong was slightly offended. \u201cYour excuses are all useless, Qin Ran. Today, I have no choice but to\u2026\u201dA cell phone suddenly appeared in Qin Ran\u2019s hand and she threw it on the table. \u201cWho are you going to talk to? Principal Xu? You don\u2019t have to look for him because he will be here soon.\u201dIn reality, Li Airong was not really serious about looking for the principal.Principal Xu was usually busy and many things in the school were managed by the vice-principal. Looking for Principal Xu was not easy.This was especially since many unknown visitors usually came to see Principal Xu. These visitors either drove luxury cars or had red car plates and were very impressive.In recent years, the teachers and students of the school came to know that Principal Xu\u2019s background was probably not simple. It was as difficult to reach him as calling the hotline of the mayor.The Ninth Class fell silent. The students looked at Qin Ran in surprise.Li Airong was also stunned for a moment before saying with an angry expression, \u201cDo you think I will believe a lie that you casually threw out? I can also say that Principal Xu is at my house now\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with the ruckus?\u201d Before Li Airong could finish, a deep voice was heard.An old man slowly walked over with his hands behind his back.He hid his pair of sharp eyes behind his glasses.1Principal Xu rarely appeared, so most of the students did not recognize him. However, his esteemed presence was not to be underestimated.\u201cPrincipal Xu?\u201d Li Airong and Gao Yang\u2019s hearts skipped a beat.Xu Yaoguang could not help but look at Qin Ran. So this was the life-saving benefactor who was able to get his grandfather to call him here? Who exactly was Qin Ran?The Ninth Class was silent again.Li Airong paused and looked at Qin Ran.Gritting her teeth, she said, \u201cPrincipal Xu, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re here. This transfer student just joined the school not long ago and is already stirring up trouble. Last night, she fought with Jiang Han, who is in my class, and disrupted the learning of my students. I am sure you know that our class has to focus on the exams and can\u2019t afford to be disrupted.\u201dPrincipal Xu was still calmly looking at Qin Ran.Qin Ran lowered her eyes and seemed to be thinking about something. Not making a sound, her expression was indecipherable.Li Airong looked at her more scornfully. Now that Principal Xu was here, why was she still silent?After Principal Xu arrived, the class was quiet for a moment before a commotion broke out again.The voices of many girls were heard.\u201cI bet her act was exposed and she has nothing to say anymore. Out of everyone, she just had to fight with Jiang Han. And now Principal Xu is really here.\u201d Jiang Han\u2019s results were not bad, and her father was a nouveau riche. The books in the school\u2019s library were all donated by her father.\u201cWhat act? She was the one who invited him here.\u201d\u201cShe has the same surname as Qin Yu, so why is she so different from her?\u201d Most of the gossip came from the girls.Once Qin Ran joined, she became a celebrity in school. Every day after class, many people would look for her. If she were like Qin Yu, who had a good family background, good results and good looks, they would be accepting, but someone like Qin Ran just made them jealous.The classroom was filled with noise.\u201cMs. Li, you said that you cared about the students in your class, so why don\u2019t you know that Jiang Han from your class has been threatening Pan Mingyue with violence?\u201d Qin Ran lifted her head, smiled and said quietly.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Li Airong was shocked.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to argue. You can take a look at the surveillance cameras that monitor the hallway of the girl\u2019s dormitory.\u201d Qin Ran turned to look at Li Airong and coldly said, \u201d You said that you care so much about the health and growth of your students, so I want to know why do you not care that Jiang Han has been insulting and threatening Pan Mingyue.\u201dHer last sentence made the entire Ninth Class stare at Li Airong.Li Airong\u2019s face gradually turned pale.Since it concerned Pan Mingyue, Principal Xu became serious.He sternly said, \u201cMs. Li, I have to check the surveillance cameras and get the police to investigate this. If it really is as Qin Ran said, violence in school cannot be tolerated.\u201d1How did this turn into school violence and involved the police?Since Qin Ran mentioned the surveillance cameras, it meant that she did not lie. Li Airong tried to adapt to the circumstances and quickly said, \u201cPrincipal Xu, I apologize. I did not clarify things and did not know that this was related to Pan Mingyue\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no use telling me this. Qin Ran is the one you should address.\u201d Principal Xu calmly reminded her.Li Airong was pale with rage. Apologizing to a student, especially a student she looked down on, was a little humiliating. In the end, she braced herself and apologized to Qin Ran in front of the entire Ninth Class. \u201cQin Ran, I\u2019m sorry for misunderstanding you.\u201d1\u201cThat\u2019s not needed. Besides, I\u2019ve heard that in the past that Ms. Li was a righteous and good teacher who cared about her students. I didn\u2019t expect that you would be so corrupt and despise the poor and curry favor with the rich,\u201d Qin Ran indifferently said.1A few boys in the Ninth Class could not help but burst into laughter.Li Airong did not want to stay a moment longer. She lowered her pale face and left. Today, she embarrassed herself.When she walked past Gao Yang, she directed her anger at him and viciously said, \u201cMr. Gao, don\u2019t be so proud. Look at the trash in your class. I want to see how many of them will actually pass the college entrance examination.\u201d1The bell that marked the end of class sounded.Due to this conflict, the class was delayed for about eight minutes.Many people were already gathered outside the Ninth Class.Qiao Sheng kicked a stool and stood up. Standing firmly on the ground, he arrogantly said, \u201cQin Ran, what exactly happened? Do you need me to help you teach Jiang Han a lesson?\u201dThe students in the Ninth Class who were gossiping about Qin Ran did not dare to say anything more.Qin Ran packed her books and said indifferently, \u201cNo.\u201dAfter glancing at Qin Ran, Xu Yaoguang took his books and said faintly, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Qin Yu said that she will be practicing a new song tonight.\u201dRecently, he was obsessed with Qin Yu\u2019s new song, and Qiao Sheng also knew about it.As Qin Yu did not see Xu Yaoguang and him downstairs, she went upstairs to wait for them.Seeing that a lot of people had gathered outside the Ninth Class and were talking about Qin Ran without noticing that she was there, Qin Yu could not help but pinch herself.She pursed her lips, looked up and sighed in worry. \u201cI heard from them that my sister got into trouble again?\u201dLiked it?

He paused for a while before looking at Qin Yu.Quiet and taciturn.However, Qiao Sheng suddenly tilted his head and looked at Qin Yu strangely.1Qin Yu squeezed her book tightly and smiled. \u201cDid I say something wrong? Getting into fights is nothing new for my sister. This is the truth. If she didn\u2019t cause trouble, a school would not have rejected her in the past. If Principal Xu did not pity her, how could she be accepted here considering her personal record?\u201d\u201cWhy are you so prejudiced against your sister? She\u2019s not like what you said. Today\u2019s problems were caused by Jiang Han from your class.\u201d Qiao Sheng dribbled the basketball in his hand and rebutted her without much expression.5Qin Yu was startled.She did not think that Qiao Sheng would speak to her like that.\u201cI\u2019m going to the court to play basketball. I won\u2019t be going to the Art Building today,\u201d Qiao Sheng said to Xu Yaoguang before dribbling his basketball away and rallying a few boys to the court. He did not apologize to Qin Yu.Xu Yaoguang nodded. After Qiao Sheng left, he saw that Qin Yu was still in shock and slowly spoke. \u201cPrincipal Xu is not a sympathetic person.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Qin Yu did not react.After a while, she pursed her lips and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re joking again. How do you know what sort of person Principal Xu is like?\u201d3After that, she hugged her books and quietly walked. Looking at the few boys in front who were playing basketball, Qin Yu felt very depressed.She was not very sure of Xu Yaoguang\u2019s identity. That time, he defended her once in front of Wei Zihang, and she felt that someone who could stand up to Wei Zihang was not ordinary.However, in the past two years, Xu Yaoguang stayed in the dormitory and dressed and ate simply.Due to this reason, even though his surname was Xu, no one associated him with Principal Xu.In contrast, Qiao Sheng was an obvious rich second-generation heir.1The two of them walked into the Art Building.Qin Yu did not do anything else besides practicing hard on the violin. She seemed to spend almost 10 hours every day on the violin. Now, her playing was smoother and clearer than the past.2However, it still seemed to lack something.1Nevertheless, a few members of the Student Union were shocked and very excited. \u201cQin Yu, do you want to play this on the school founder\u2019s day? This also sounds amazing.\u201d\u201cI thought that the song to be placed on the school founder\u2019s day was already fixed.\u201d Qin Yu pursed her lips. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find a mentor using this song. I composed it myself.\u201d10\u201cReally?\u201d Everyone present was in awe and envy.Only Xu Yaoguang was a little hesitant.Qin Yu\u2019s playing was great, but it seemed to be missing something. He frowned and could not say anything.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Qin Yu asked him.Xu Yaoguang snapped out of his thoughts. \u201cIt sounds really good.\u201dOnce Qin Yu was done practicing, she went to the cafeteria to eat with Xu Yaoguang.**Since class ended late today, Qin Ran continued to stay in the classroom for a while.It rained quite heavily tonight. The rain and fog made everything misty, and even the houses nearby looked blurry.Lin Siran talked to Nie Fei about a poster and left with Nie Fei carrying an umbrella. She originally wanted to get an umbrella from the dormitory, but after seeing Pan Mingyue at the doorway of the Ninth Class with a black umbrella in hand, Lin Siran smiled and informed Qin Ran.At this time, the five of them shared two umbrellas as they walked across the school. It was not noisy and mostly quiet.4The school\u2019s medical office.As it suddenly rained, few people were in there now.Lu Zhaoying leaned back on his chair, propped both of his legs up and tapped his fingers on the table. He turned to look at Cheng Juan. \u201cMaster Juan, President Jiang wants to see you.\u201dCheng Juan was currently analyzing a rare illness. In response, he coldly turned a page and lazily replied without looking up. \u201cI will not see him.\u201dThe operation was already over, so there was no reason to see him.Knowing that Cheng Juan was usually impatient with these things, Lu Zhaoying was not surprised. Looking outside the door, he said in concern, \u201cIt\u2019s raining so heavily. I wonder if Qin Ran brought an umbrella with her. She just recovered from a fever.\u201dCheng Juan paused and could not help but raise his head.The door of the school\u2019s sickbay was still open because Qin Ran had not arrived.Just as he spoke, they saw two people walking towards them. The girl who was holding an umbrella had short hair and wore glasses, so her face could not be seen clearly. She was actually quite attractive but looked a little boring compared to the girl beside her.Cheng Juan did not notice that his eyes were focused on the girl beside her.She was indifferent and cool. Her remarkable eyes were vivid in the fog and as bright as a landscape painting.Qin Ran had not spoken to Pan Mingyue at all from the beginning to the end.When Qin Ran walked into the sickbay, Pan Mingyue turned around to walk to the cafeteria.Looking at her back view, Lu Zhaoying felt that she was quite thin. He could not help but turn around and ask, \u201cQin Ran, is that your classmate? Why don\u2019t you ask her to sit down? Look, her clothes are all wet.\u201d\u201cShe has no time and needs to rush back to study.\u201d As her school jacket was wet, Qin Ran took it off.Lu Zhaoying remarked. \u201cWhat a nerd.\u201dCheng Juan picked up the air conditioner remote control and raised the temperature by a few degrees.He continued to look at the case but did not focus. In the residual light in the kitchen, he saw Qin Ran. He appeared expressionless but was actually irascible.She was very unhappy, and her body language also showed that she was upset.Cheng Juan continued to look at his case. He leaned on the sofa and turned the pages carelessly.These two days, the three of them had developed a difficult relationship. Even after putting aside their differences, Lu Zhaoying did not feel defensive against Qin Ran.2When Cheng Juan said that there was a shortage of people, Lu Zhaoying did not stop him.At this time, Lu Zhaoying invited Qin Ran to stay for dinner and Qin Ran could not reject him.There were many people in the cafeteria, and she rarely went there.She usually went out to look for shops with few people, it was quite time-consuming.As they were eating, Cheng Juan slightly lifted his feet. He saw that she looked distressed and could not help but ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Qin Ran responded. The girl who was usually cool seemed out of character. She narrowed her eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s a parent-teacher meeting this Saturday, but my grandmother is still in the hospital.\u201dLu Zhaoying originally wanted to say something, but he suddenly remembered Ning Qing. She lowered her head and started to eat quietly.Cheng Juan looked at her for a while and could not help but smile. He usually looked lazy, and even his smile sometimes caused others to feel stressed. But as he smiled now, his eyes were clear like melted snow.\u201cIt\u2019s not like your teacher knows your family,\u201d he said.Lu Zhaoying generously said, \u201cQin Ran, I can be your dad!\u201d5Qin Ran touched her chin, looked at Lu Zhaoying and considered this possibility. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to be my dad.\u201d\u201cI can be your brother. It\u2019s settled, then.\u201d Lu Zhaoying straightened his clothes and was very pleased with himself. Then, he asked, \u201cIs that student you were with in the same class as you?\u201d1Cheng Juan looked at him expressionlessly.The two of them discussed for a long time until they finished eating. Lu Zhaoying was still immersed in the conversation and suddenly felt Cheng Juan\u2019s gaze.Cheng Juan\u2019s face was as picturesque and kind. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t I seen Lu Zhaoying, the resolute man, so enthusiastic before?\u201dHowever, Lu Zhaoying\u2019s legs went soft. He scratched his head again. \u201cOh, Master Juan, Qin Ran is quite attractive, and I was drawn to her when I saw her. However, I really don\u2019t feel that way about her.\u201dHe was not daring enough.Qin Ran spoke quite matter-of-factly. There was no one to take her to the parent-teacher meeting on Saturday.However, Lu Zhaoying felt an inexplicable sadness.He had never cared about other people\u2019s feelings before, but during the past few days that Qin Ran was here, he did not mention her family at all.Even though she was responsible for both of their meals, he did not even look up her information.If one must know, to be the chef of both of them, she had to go through multiple rounds of interviews.Cheng Juan initially said it casually, but after hearing this, he recomposed himself and pondered slightly. \u201cContinue talking.\u201dLu Zhaoying scratched his head, touched his earring and looked away. \u201cI just\u2026 think that I feel an inexplicable closeness to her. How about we threaten her mother together since I have the time after eating?\u201d1\u201cCloseness?\u201d Cheng Juan\u2019s face darkened and continued laughing.\u201cAh, no.\u201d Lu Zhaoying stood up as if a lightbulb lit up in his head. \u201cI think she\u2019s like\u2026\u201dLiked it?

He might even fly to Africa to mine in the evening.2He had said she was like his mother casually, of course, but Lu Zhaoying couldn\u2019t remember where the specific sense of familiarity came from.1Cheng Juan continued to look at him expressionlessly. His eyes were as thick as ink, but Lu Zhaoying\u2019s scalp was about to explode.He cleaned up the bowls that the three had eaten. \u201cThen\u2026 Master Juan, I have to wash the plates?\u201dCheng Juan retracted his gaze and nodded.His emotions couldn\u2019t be heard, and Lu Zhaoying sighed a breath of relief in the kitchen. He was still thinking about it, pondering over where the familiarity had come from.**The Lin family.Qin Yu had been practicing the violin these two days, familiarizing herself with the melody.Lin Wan lived in Beijing. Qin Yu knew what status her aunt\u2019s married family had in Beijing. Although the Lin family was considered a wealthy family in Yun Cheng, they weren\u2019t worth a mention in Beijing.Since she had this opportunity, she had to seize it no matter what. Besides attending school, Qin Yu ate quickly and was basically in the violin room the whole day.Downstairs, Lin Jinxuan came back late today and found Qin Yu absent as he ate.Ning Qing smiled happily. \u201cYu\u2019er is practicing in the violin room. I\u2019ll bring dinner to her later. She has improved a lot recently.\u201dLin Jinxuan didn\u2019t expect her to work so hard, but he had also heard Lin Wan talk about the teacher in Beijing, so it wasn\u2019t too surprising.After eating, he went to the study on the second floor. The door of the piano room wasn\u2019t closed. When he passed by the violin room, he heard a low voice come from inside.He had heard the violin played by Qin Yu, but had never heard this melody before.He paused.Qin Yu put down her violin, looked up, and found Lin Jinxuan standing outside the door. She was a little surprised. \u201cBrother? Why are you back?\u201dLin Jinxuan shoved his mobile phone in his pocket, smiled softly, and said with a gentle voice, \u201cYu\u2019er, your violin has made a lot of progress. Just\u2026 use less emotion and practice more.\u201dLin Jinxuan had played the violin since young.Because he knew music as well, Lin Jinxuan rarely praised her. At most, he would only nod and say it was \u201cNot bad\u201d if she asked.This was the first time Lin Jinxuan had praised her.Qin Yu pursed her lips and then smiled. \u201cThank you, brother. This is a song I composed myself, but it needs improvement. Could I ask you if you have time?\u201d7\u201cYourself?\u201d Lin Jinxuan was a little surprised. The song was cold and dark, and the structure was also a little big. It didn\u2019t seem to suit Qin Yu.Qin Yu nodded. \u201cIt just needs improvement.\u201d\u201cIt needs to be changed. The entire style doesn\u2019t suit you. Give me your music notations and I\u2019ll take a look.\u201d Lin Jinxuan looked at Qin Yu in surprise. \u201cBut it\u2019s impressive.\u201dFinally, he couldn\u2019t help but praise her.Qin Yu just tilted her head and smiled.3**The next day.In the second class in the morning, Qin Ran accompanied Lin Siran and Nie Fei to get colored chalk.1In high school, too few people were willing to engage in the board. But Tuesday to Wednesday was too tight a time, so Lin Siran only found Nie Fei as a companion.Nie Fei was in charge of painting, and time was short.Lin Siran took Qin Ran together.While going to get the colored chalk, Lin Siran wanted Qin Ran to go with them.Wu Yan also went to the office to get English papers.It happened that Qin Yu was holding the Chemistry papers, so Wu Yan was waiting for Qin Yu to walk together with her.When they were in the corridor, they saw Qin Ran and Lin Siran downstairs, walking from the comprehensive building to the teaching building, during which there was a sophomore boy who even gave her a love letter.Thinking of what happened yesterday, and how Qiao Sheng had yet to come to find her, Qin Yu pursed her lips and asked, seemingly nonchalant, \u201cHow\u2019s Qiao Sheng\u2019s relationship with your class\u2019 new student?\u201d\u201cQin Ran?\u201d At the mention of this, Wu Yan\u2019s expression was also very complicated. \u201cQiao Sheng covers for her very much. Nobody dares to go against Qin Ran in class.\u201dFrom the big jar of lollipops last time to Qiao Sheng wanting to put Jiang Han and the others in place, class 3.9 didn\u2019t dare to even talk about Qin Ran.\u201cOh.\u201d Qin Yu had expected it and didn\u2019t have any expression on her face.She wasn\u2019t familiar with Qiao Sheng and only knew him mainly because of Xu Yaoguang. She didn\u2019t know why Qiao Sheng still followed behind Xu Yaoguang even though he was obviously the rich second generation kid.1Qin Yu knew Qiao Sheng through Xu Yaoguang.At this time, she didn\u2019t know what to say and remained silent.Wu Yan saw that Qin Yu was still staring at Qin Ran and the others, lowered her head and pouted as well. Her tone was sour as she said, \u201cThat\u2019s our class board that nobody was willing to do. Old Gao found Lin Siran, and Nie Fei also knows how to draw. I don\u2019t know why Qin Ran is there with them, what does she even know how to do? Her words are like a dog\u2019s claws. I just hope she doesn\u2019t ruin our board review.\u201dQin Yu was listening while her thoughts flew.They had two days to do up the board, and the first theme was regarding the \u201cHigh School Entrance Examination\u201d.Lin Siran wrote well. She used her spare time to post the content.Nie Fei would then paint it.On Tuesday, Lin Siran used noon for self-study, and there was time for self-study during class too. She wrote almost everything and left a blank space for Nie Fei to paint.At noon on Wednesday, Nie Fei drew a little and waited for self-study at night to do the rest.They studied from six to ten in the evening. Four hours was enough.By the end of the evening, more than half of the board was still blank.Qin Ran sat on a stool and flipped through her books. She sat there leaning against the wall, lazily supporting her chin, waiting for Lin Siran to leave first.Before they both left, they saw Nie Fei walking over.Lin Siran put away the math papers and was very happy. \u201cNie Fei, wait for me, I\u2019ll be done right away.\u201dIn the past two days, she ate dinner with Nie Fei.Before she finished speaking, she saw Nie Fei bow to her guiltily. \u201cSiran, Qin Ran, I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t continue to participate in the bulletin anymore. Someone just notified me that the student union has a reminder board and I must go there instead.\u201dNie Fei was an officer in the art department of the Student Union, which was considered official business.Lin Siran also knew this, so she smiled forcefully. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201dWhen Nie Fei left, she sat down on the chair, looking sadly at the blank spaces on the poster. \u201cAhhhhhhhh, Ran Ran, what should we do?\u201dIf Nie Fei had told her yesterday, Lin Siran could have found someone else.But it was already night, and some people weren\u2019t staying in school and didn\u2019t attend self-study, so Lin Siran wouldn\u2019t be able to find anyone.Lin Siran was annoyed. A girl from the front came over and lowered her voice.\u201cSiran, have you offended Qin Yu?\u201d the girl whispered.1Lin Siran was aggressive and shook her head directly. She had reminded Qin Ran before that Qin Yu mustn\u2019t be messed with, so how could she have committed that mistake? \u201cHow could it be?\u201d\u201cThen I don\u2019t know.\u201d The girl glanced at Lin Siran. \u201cWhen I went to the comprehensive building in the afternoon, I saw Qin Yu asking Nie Fei to help draw the student union\u2019s board poster.\u201dQin Yu had a good family background and her grades were good. Compared to Lin Siran, it wasn\u2019t difficult for Nie Fei to help Qin Yu instead.Even though she knew this, Lin Siran still frowned. Since she couldn\u2019t find anyone else to do the board, she could only do it herself.Qin Ran kept her phone in her pocket. She stood up, knocked on the table and frowned, her face shrouded in the shadows so that her expression couldn\u2019t be seen. \u201cGo and eat first.\u201dHer voice was also light.Lin Siran wasn\u2019t in the mood to joke around today, so she went to the cafeteria sadly.The cafeteria was far from the teaching building.It took almost ten minutes.Xu Yaoguang was having dinner with Principal Xu at night. He didn\u2019t go to the cafeteria and went back to the class to get his jacket.Today the door of the class was unlocked. He plugged the key back and walked toward the front door. The front office was opened. As soon as he reached out, he saw a person standing at the blackboard behind, drawing something on it.Xu Yaoguang stopped subconsciously not far from the door, squinting his eyes, glancing over coldly.Liked it?

Look back!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosXu Yaoguang knew that the board had to be re-designed. He was still in the Student Union and would only hand over his role in the next semester. Tomorrow morning, he was going to rate the scores with several members of the Student Union.Xu Yaoguang looked at the stick figure on the blackboard. The lines were simple and smooth, and cartoon characters were being drawn. They looked vivid and remarkably true to life on the board.Xu Yaoguang felt that the characters looked quite familiar, but he couldn\u2019t figure out who it was yet.The other party drew very quickly and seemed familiar with it. The characters were sketched out almost instantly.The coloring was also very bold.This was based on real painting skills.Xu Yaoguang never thought that he would see this level of painting in the poster.1The person drawing was facing away from him. She was leaning sideways, wearing black headphones on her ears, and the headphone cord swayed slightly as she moved.She took a step back and seemed to be observing her painted characters.Xu Yaoguang stood at the entrance of the classroom for a long time. When he stepped back, he saw her turn her face.The other party was absentminded and played with the headphone cable in one hand while she held the chalk in the other. She admired her painting cynically.Her slightly squinted eyes were light and slow.Xu Yaoguang\u2019s heart trembled a bit.It was Qin Ran.Most of his understanding of Qin Ran was that she had poor grades and didn\u2019t like to study. Her words looked like elementary school students\u2019 and during class, she was either lying on the table or holding an extra-curricular book.She read everything. Fiction, foreign books, and magazines.These were well known in class 3.9.Xu Yaoguang took a step back, pursed his lips, and looked at Qin Ran as she turned to look for chalk. Instead of going in to get his coat, he glanced at Qin Ran and walked back down without a word.\u201cWhy did you take so long?\u201d Xu Yaoguang found a black car on the side road next to the school and got in. They came to En Yu Hotel and Principal Xu looked at him sideways.Xu Yaoguang turned back and whispered, \u201cI went back to get something back in class.\u201dPrincipal Xu nodded and stopped speaking.He didn\u2019t sit down first but looked at Cheng Juan and Lu Zhaoying, who were sitting next to President Xu. He was stunned for a while before saying slowly, \u201cMaster Juan? Young Master Lu?\u201dCheng Juan held the teacup in his hand, and his long fingers squeezed the lid of the cup to let go of the floating foam, lazy and casual.Lu Zhaoying didn\u2019t like drinking tea and was slightly surprised to see him. He raised an eyebrow. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that Young Master Xu was also in Yun Cheng.\u201dCheng Juan wasn\u2019t old, but he was the eldest son of Old Master Cheng and had very high seniority in Beijing, so everyone who knew him called him Master Juan.\u201cI suggested that he transfer here.\u201d Principal Xu let the waiters serve the dish and smiled slightly.There was probably some internal affairs, so Cheng Juan just nodded and didn\u2019t probe into their personal matters.2After half of the meal, Cheng Juan leaned on the back of the chair and put his hands on the table. \u201cElder Xu, I hear rumors from the school that you approved a recommendation for a little girl.\u201d\u201cYes, I did.\u201d Principal Xu laughed and looked far away. \u201cMore than one.\u201d\u201cMore than one?\u201d Cheng Juan played with the cup and raised an eyebrow.\u201cLet\u2019s not discuss this matter.\u201d Principal Xu shook his head, apparently not wanting to say more.Cheng Juan didn\u2019t ask much, but Lu Zhaoying couldn\u2019t help it. He took a sip of wine and asked, \u201cElder Xu, who is the good successor you were talking about last time?\u201d1Elder Xu shook his head at this and didn\u2019t speak.Lu Zhaoying felt like his heart had been scratched by a kitten and was full of curiosity, but since Elder Xu didn\u2019t want to reveal it, he didn\u2019t force him to either.1Xu Yaoguang had been eating and couldn\u2019t participate in their dialogue.Only when Lu Zhaoying mentioned his successor, he looked up suddenly at Elder Xu. He pursed his lips in disbelief, his fingers white and his knuckles raised.After the meal, Elder Xu and Young Master Xu left first.Lu Zhaoying stayed with Cheng Juan for a while.Manager Wang took a food container and Lu Zhaoying took it. The two men took the elevator down.At the door, Lin Jinxuan entered with Feng Ci. The two wanted to talk about something. It just so happened that Lin Wan and Lin Qi also wanted to invite Feng Ci for dinner.As an investor of Lin Jinxuan and the son of Mayor Feng, it was enough to make Lin Wan and Lin Qi cautious and respectful.Mayor Feng\u2019s style had always been very positive. He didn\u2019t easily go to have meals with others, and the Feng family members were not easy to get close to either. With this opportunity, Lin Wan and Lin Qi both attached great importance to it.Feng Ci saw the two and was slightly shocked. He paused and greeted. \u201cMr. Lu.\u201dRespectful.As for the two titles \u201cYoung Master Lu\u201d and \u201cMaster Juan\u201d, he wasn\u2019t in the Beijing circle, so he didn\u2019t dare call them that.1Cheng Juan was used to prestige in Beijing, and he didn\u2019t speak at this time. Only Lu Zhaoying answered him with a smile.He wasn\u2019t very familiar with him either, so they just left after saying hello.When they had left, Lin Jinxuan said, \u201cThe two just now\u2026\u201d\u201cBeijing\u2019s Cheng family and Lu family.\u201d Feng Ci lowered his voice.Lin Jinxuan took deep breaths for a long while before regaining his breath calmly and expressing his understanding.He had been to Beijing before and knew that the city was full of tigers crouching for opportunities. The person walking casually on the road could be someone you couldn\u2019t afford to mess with. The Lin family was not worth a mention in the city.This was one of the reasons why Lin Jinxuan insisted on starting a business.\u201cBrother, Brother Feng.\u201d A light voice sounded. Qin Yu was waiting upstairs and she went downstairs to hold Lin Jinxuan\u2019s arm and thoughtfully looked out the door. \u201cWho did you just talk to?\u201dShe had just got off the elevator and had only seen the two\u2019s back figures.Feng Ci also bent slightly, quite respectfully.That was Feng Ci, the Mayor\u2019s son, the person even Lin Jinxuan had to be careful of.\u201cTwo acquaintances.\u201d Feng Ci didn\u2019t say much to Qin Yu and just smiled.Qin Yu followed the two up the elevator and couldn\u2019t help turning back.Upstairs, when he saw Mrs. Feng sitting next to Lin Wan, Feng Ci was stunned. \u201cMom?\u201dMrs. Feng rolled her eyes at him before smiling at Qin Yu. \u201cYu\u2019er, come here, come sit with me.\u201dShe obviously really liked Qin Yu.Lin Wan and Lin Qi looked at each other in surprise.**The next morning, in First Middle School.As soon as she entered class 3.9, the sounds inside were almost exploding. It was early reading time, but the windows and doors of the class were surrounded by many people, mostly girls.Qiao Sheng frowned. He kicked the door open and was very annoyed. \u201cIt\u2019s so noisy.\u201d\u201cOh, you, Master Qiao, you\u2019re finally here!\u201d His deskmate turned over and was very excited.\u201cWhat?\u201d Qiao Sheng glanced over and touched his hair.During the conversation, more and more people gathered by the window door.The boy raised his chin to the back, his face flushed. \u201cLook back, look back!\u201dAt this time, members of the Student Union were taking their books to inspect the posters one by one.Starting from the senior grade.\u201cPresident, what\u2019s going on in your class?\u201d Someone whispered to Xu Yaoguang.Qin Yu seemed to be in a good mood. She smiled and followed behind Xu Yaoguang. She saw the buzz in class 3.9 and smiled. \u201cMaybe the poster was drawn well.\u201d4She took the book first and walked into class 3.9 through the crowd.Liked it?

    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: She Is Qin RanPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euQin Ran was very popular in school.She was individualistic and replaced Qin Yu as the campus belle the moment she arrived at First Middle School.Qin Ran was pretty and news of her looks didn\u2019t just travel across First Middle School. Even students from the surrounding schools nearby, Experimental Middle School, Sixth Middle School, and Zi High School all skipped lessons to come and see her.HD pictures of Qin Ran were sneakily posted everywhere in school. Even so, there were still praises about her outstanding beauty.Qin Yu used to say that she didn\u2019t like anyone paying too much attention to her, but now that all of them were discussing Qin Ran, and even her status as the campus belle had been taken away, she was in a bad mood.What did Qin Ran do to deserve this?She didn\u2019t study well and loved to fight. She had a bad attitude and exhibited everything that bad students had.Qin Yu was very clear about the progress report of class 3.9\u2019s poster. She had come to find Nie Fie yesterday night, so Nie Fei didn\u2019t have time to draw anything.Almost everyone in Class 3.9 had their heads tilted or were leaning against their chairs, looking back.The smile on Qin Yu\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t have time to expand. She saw the contents on the rear board and was dismayed.The people behind laughed and wanted to ask her why she didn\u2019t continue walking when they saw the bulletin board and their eyes widened as well.Xu Yaoguang went to the student council early in the morning and convened the representatives of various departments for a meeting, and then inspected each class.Yesterday, he was in a hurry and had left without seeing the complete process. Qin Ran had painted two very alive cartoon characters, one of which was colored.He didn\u2019t see the full version until now.Lin Siran divided the poster into four parts. She copied two poems and wrote a few high school senior inspirational quotes, leaving a blank space in the middle, which was the countdown to the college entrance examination.The remaining four blank spaces each had a cartoon character.There were four in total, from right to left.The first was in a white shirt and black slacks. Her hair was shredded, her face blushed, and she had a pair of beautiful and expressive eyes.The second was wearing a T-shirt, holding a microphone and looking far away.The third was wearing a cotton jacket with a bandage on his arm.The fourth was a punk outfit, with overhead sky spotlights.It was like a growth history.The most shocking thing was that the entire blackboard was painted like a stage effect. The various chalks exactly depicted the spotlight and all the famous poems and characters were perfectly embedded in it.In the bottom row, there were countless little white figures, probably only one finger high, holding light boards.Even though he had taken a glimpse yesterday, Xu Yaoguang was still shocked by this grand scene.The student union was silent collectively, and no one spoke.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! It\u2019s Yan Xi! It\u2019s the process of his debut, and the last one is the costume he wore during the latest concert!\u201d\u201cMy Yan Xi! He\u2019s so! Handsome!\u201d\u201cOh my God! I\u2019m transferring to class 3.9!\u201dYan Xi was the craze now and was absolutely the top three in the entertainment industry.The sound outside was endless.Almost all of them came out to take photos with their mobile phones, tweeted them, and posted them in school.\u201cNie Fei, you turned out to be a hidden fangirl! Impressive! I didn\u2019t realize it before, but you are my goddess from today!\u201d Nie Fei of Class 3.9 was also surrounded.Nie Fei had made a poster for the Student Union last night, and she just entered the class. She was dumbfounded. \u201cNo, no, no\u2026 I was in the student union last night, you\u2026 you can ask Siran and Qin Ran\u2026\u201dThose people went to find Qin Ran and Lin Siran instead.Qin Ran was lazily crouching on the table, flipping through a book. She was always in a bad mood when she got up in the morning.The look on her pretty face was cold.Class 3.9 knew her temper, so no one dared to ask her anything. But that didn\u2019t prevent them from mentioning Qin Ran.Qin Yu saw Qiao Sheng kick off his chair and sit in Qin Ran\u2019s front table. He tilted his head and seemed to want to ask her something.\u201cNo fault, no fault at all.\u201d The Head of Functions waved his hand and was the first to announce this.Qin Yu glanced at Xu Yaoguang again and saw that he had his head lowered and was writing very seriously. She gripped her pen tighter.\u201cQin Yu, you are too impressive.\u201d The head of functions gave Qin Yu a thumbs up. \u201cHow did you know that the board of class 3.9 was this good, and you even wanted to come here first?\u201dQin Yu: \u201c\u2026\u201d Her face was completely ashen.**Class 3.9 was really noisy.Qin Ran put on her headphones expressionlessly, her eyebrows furrowed.What was going on with this group of students?She was wearing her school uniform, and her pure white face lifted slightly as if looking out the window. The irritability at the bottom of her eyes burst out, determined to soar into the sky.\u201cRan Ran.\u201d Lin Siran didn\u2019t cover her heart and reluctantly pulled her eyes from the poster on the back until the teaching director came to maintain order. She looked at Qin Ran. \u201cWho was this, who could have drawn this? Who was it?!\u201dLin Siran regained her senses and looked at Qin Ran, unable to contain her excitement.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Qin Ran laid down on the table impatiently.Lin Siran whispered \u201cOh\u201d and then said again, \u201cRan Ran, you didn\u2019t do any paper last night.\u201dShe was very attentive and took her papers to Qin Ran to copy.Qin Ran got up again and held a pen with her left hand. She copied the paper, her eyes narrowed and cold and her expression irritable.Class 3.9 became famous for this matter.Few people studied seriously and all looked in the direction of Lin Siran and Qin Ran, whispering.Xu Yaoguang was flipping through his English books, and everyone around was discussing who painted it. He couldn\u2019t help looking at Qin Ran. She was silent and indifferent. He wrote with his pen in his left hand very slowly.But\u2026Xu Yaoguang\u2019s hand paused. He remembered very clearly that she had used her right hand last night.Early morning classes were short.There were many people in class 3.9. Xu Yaoguang went out to buy breakfast. Qiao Sheng looked at Qin Ran lying on the table. She seemed to think it was noisy and covered her head with her school uniform.He touched his nose and went out with Xu Yaoguang.After early reading, more people came to Class 3.9, and there was no crowding in the corridor.They were either discussing the bulletin board or who painted it.Qin Yu was waiting for them downstairs. She glanced at Qiao Sheng walking beside Xu Yaoguang, but Qiao Sheng didn\u2019t look at her and continued talking to Xu Yaoguang.\u201cI don\u2019t know who it is,\u201d Qiao Sheng whispered. He put his hands in his pockets and cursed with a smile. \u201cQin Ran is always sleeping and ignoring me. I gave her a can of candies for nothing.\u201dXu Yaoguang was silent. He had always been indifferent. Few people knew what he was doing at home, and nothing seemed to attract him.At the mention of Qin Ran, he raised an eyebrow.Qin Yu stood aside and pursed her lips. Both of their reactions bothered her.She pretended to be relaxed. \u201cThis person is very impressive and probably isn\u2019t from our school. Otherwise, someone would have come out to claim it.\u201dThat poster had indeed not been claimed, and Qin Yu couldn\u2019t go against her conscience and say that it wasn\u2019t nice.\u201cThe person who painted is a student in our school,\u201d Xu Yaoguang suddenly said.Qiao Sheng and Qin Yu were both surprised. They stared at him: \u201c\u2026\u201dXu Yaoguang\u2019s eyes were complicated. \u201cShe is Qin Ran.\u201dLiked it?

Subjectively, she didn\u2019t believe it at all, but this was Xu Yaoguang she was talking about. Other people might joke around, but he wouldn\u2019t.Xu Yaoguang\u2019s eyes were still and he looked very calm. His lips were pursed and he didn\u2019t speak.Qiao Sheng was speechless now.Even Qin Yu knew that Xu Yaoguang wasn\u2019t joking, so how could he not know?At the cafeteria, he bought a box of soy milk, inserted the straw into it, and said after a moment, \u201cIs it really her?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Xu Yaoguang bought a bowl of porridge, his expression still cold.Qiao Sheng was completely speechless at this moment. Qin Yu sat beside them and was ignored for the first time. She was even more confused in her heart.How could it be Qin Ran?How could it be her?!The disposable chopsticks in Qin Yu\u2019s hands were almost deformed. Who the hell was Qin Ran? Her studies were bad and she didn\u2019t have any expertise other than fighting.In the past, besides the violin, she didn\u2019t even attend any other interest classes. She had a weird personality and not many people were willing to play with her.How could she draw? And so well too?!Qin Yu always felt that Qin Ran was under her control like she knew everything about her, but today Qin Yu found that after having not seen Qin Ran for so many years, her knowledge of her was blank.Thinking of it, the disposable chopsticks tightened again.She looked up and smiled casually. \u201cI\u2019ll go practice the violin.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Xu, I\u2019ll go find Qin Ran.\u201d Qiao Sheng stood up suddenly.Xu Yaoguang nodded, his eyes cold. \u201cSure.\u201d**A group of people was gathered in class 3.9 and Lin Siran went out to buy breakfast.Qiao Sheng was sitting on Lin Siran\u2019s stool. Qin Ran was still sleeping. He reached out, poked her arm, and turned his head carefully to say, \u201cDid you draw it?\u201d\u201cQiao Sheng.\u201d Qin Ran was still covered in her school uniform. Her voice was a little hoarse, and her tone was low. \u201cDon\u2019t make noise.\u201dShe was reluctant to say more, and Qiao Sheng remembered that usually when the class was noisy, she would frown. Thus, he immediately zipped his mouth.As soon as he turned, there were more and more people in the class. It was like a vegetable market, so noisy that it caused a headache.He kicked the table across the aisle.\u201cSqueak\u2014\u201dA very rough and harsh sound.The crowd quieted, and Qiao Sheng put a hand on the table and looked at them sideways. \u201cBe quieter.\u201dSubsequently, their voices gradually decreased.It was already a convention between these students not to provoke Qin Ran.Qin Ran lay down for a while, and the noises in her ears disappeared, so she took the school uniform over her head and took a breath of fresh air. She sat on the chair with her knees on the table, leaning against the back wall.\u201cThat drawing\u2026\u201d Qiao Sheng glanced at her.At this angle, he could clearly see her thick and dense long eyelashes, and Qiao Sheng thought to himself that the students were right to give her the nickname \u201ceyelash essence\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s me, but don\u2019t say it out.\u201d Qin Ran thought about it and frowned again. She could imagine just how long she would be watched like a monkey every day if those students knew.\u201c\u2026 Sh*t.\u201d Qiao Sheng was silent for a moment, then he stiffened and said, \u201cWhy did you draw Yan Xi, do you like him?\u201d\u201cWho likes that stuff, it was Lin Siran.\u201d Qin Ran hugged her arms and leaned against the wall. She looked annoyed at the noise and was dispirited, but even that didn\u2019t hide her delicate face.\u201cI understand.\u201d Qiao Sheng laughed.In First Middle School, 7 out of 10 were fans of Yan Xi.It was the first time Yan Xi had been referred to as \u201cthat stuff\u201d.**The person who had drawn the board still wasn\u2019t known. The forum and Weibo had been discussing for two days to no avail.No one came out to claim it, and no one could identify who it was.But it didn\u2019t hinder Qin Ran\u2019s popularity in the slightest. Lin Siran had been responsible for the board and class 3.9 could see how attentive Li Siran had been to Qin Ran for the past two days.Because of this, Qin Ran\u2019s popularity in class 3.9 and in the school rose to another degree.Not only did it spread all over the third graders, but even the freshman also knew that there was a legendary campus belle called Qin Ran. They all wanted to see her, but they didn\u2019t dare come to the third graders\u2019 building.Qin Ran left school in the afternoon and took her thermos cup to the school hospital.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the students these days? Forget about it if the girls are probing their brains about this kind of thing, but even the boys too?\u201d Lu Zhaoying\u2019s ear studs reflected light. \u201cMaster Juan, is your charisma irresistible to the boys now, too?\u201dCheng Juan didn\u2019t speak.The young girl was slender under the sun, and she was stopped by a boy who seemed to hand her a letter in a pink cover.The girl received it politely. The boy didn\u2019t leave and stood outside the school doctor\u2019s office, staring at Qin Ran\u2019s back.Lu Zhaoying burst into laughter and said, \u201cOh, so it was for Qin Ran. I finally met someone who could compete with you.\u201dThere was no expression on Cheng Juan\u2019s face.He wore a shirt and casual pants that outlined his long legs. It was a very sexy pattern. He had a pair of black and white eyes, and the corners of his mouth casually curled up coldly.Qin Ran put down her things and went to the kitchen to take a look.She saw Cheng Juan staring at her and paused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dMaster Juan retracted his gaze and was restless. \u201cThe senior year is very important. I think it\u2019s important to study hard and not be distracted by other things.\u201dLu Zhaoying: \u201c\u2026?\u201dQin Ran nodded solemnly. \u201cThank you, I think so too.\u201dMaster Juan was surprised at her obedience.Qin Ran went in.There were still people hanging around outside, and Master Juan leaned casually on the sofa. \u201cLu Zhaoying, close the door.\u201d**In the Lin family.Qin Yu was sitting absentmindedly at the dinner table.The joy on Ning Qing\u2019s face was undisguised as she whispered, \u201cI heard that Mrs. Feng likes you very much?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d At the mention of this, Qin Yu\u2019s mood improved and she cheered up.Ning Qing\u2019s eyes brightened and she was happier. She gave Qin Yu a piece of meat. \u201cGet along well with Mrs. Feng, that Feng Ci\u2026\u201dThe Feng family had power in Yun Cheng, and it was too difficult to make friends with them.After so many years, it was the first time that Lin Wan had treated her with a good attitude.Ning Qing looked at Qin Yu, her eyes softening.She lowered her voice, using only a volume that Qin Yu could hear.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lin Wan, who was sitting opposite, also saw that Qin Yu wasn\u2019t in a good mood.\u201cThere\u2019s a parent meeting on Saturday.\u201d Qin Yu turned back and smiled. She would never mention that Qin Ran had painted the board so well, but it really did make her think of something. She seemed hesitant to speak. \u201cThe entire third grade has it. Sister is also in the third grade. Mother, you should go to her parent meeting, and let brother or father attend mine?\u201dLiked it?

She thoughtfully said, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this, don\u2019t you worry.\u201dAfter hearing Ning Qing\u2019s words, Qin Yu\u2019s lips froze slightly.She lowered her head and ate.Seeing Ning Qing\u2019s posture, it was apparent she didn\u2019t intend to talk about this at the dinner table.After dinner, Qin Yu specially watched Ning Qing\u2019s movements and saw her go outside to call someone. After thinking about it, she followed her.Ning Qing made two phone calls to Qin Ran, but she didn\u2019t pick up. She frowned and called a third time.Qin Ran finally picked up. Her voice was somber and concise. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou have a parent meeting on Saturday, right?\u201d Ning Qing said, pressing her temple. \u201cI\u2019m going to Yu\u2019er\u2019s. Call your aunt and ask her to attend your parent meeting.\u201dThe parent-teacher meeting was linked to the student\u2019s performance and attitude. Ning Qing had gone for several parent-teacher meetings for Qin Yu. At that time, they had all been in the same class. Li Airong had even named the parents whose child had bad grades.She didn\u2019t say anything serious and only criticized a little, but in the adult world, it was shameful.Thinking about Qin Ran\u2019s daily habits and grades, Ning Qing would definitely not go for her parent meeting.She was also Qin Yu\u2019s mother. Qin Yu performed well in school and was very popular. When she walked with Qin Yu, she could even hear people discussing if she was Qin Yu\u2019s mother.Every time she had a parent meeting for Qin Yu, she received the attention of other parents.Out of these two options, Ning Qing would definitely choose Qin Yu.Qin Yu stood at the door, and when she heard the words, she pinched her fingers. To be honest, rather than Ning Qing, she hoped that Lin Qi or Lin Jinxuan would attend instead.Unexpectedly, Ning Qing didn\u2019t even consider Qin Ran.Qin Yu was depressed. At this time, she even hoped that Qin Ran wasn\u2019t so lousy.**Qin Ran hung up Ning Qing\u2019s phone impatiently. She heard her mother\u2019s words and laughed.Both of her aunt\u2019s children were in school and her uncle was also in the hospital. Aunt usually took time off to visit grandmother. Qin Ran hadn\u2019t even thought of asking her to come for her parent-teacher meeting.She walked to the classroom with her thermos cup filled with water. Her eyes were somber and her face cold, exuding a chill all around her.This didn\u2019t affect those looking at her or whispering about her.Within a few days of coming to school, Mu Ying felt Qin Ran\u2019s popularity. Whether it was a post on the school or on the road, the topic was about Qin Ran. Instead, Qin Yu wasn\u2019t much discussed.These days, especially, people mainly talked about the mysterious bulletin board.After all, Qin Ran was a new student and her looks even surpassed Qin Yu\u2019s. Qin Yu was also very good-looking, but they had seen her for two years and were aesthetically tired, especially when they could now look at Qin Ran\u2019s appearance and compare them.Mu Ying was a freshman and was still in military training. After dinner in the evening, she continued to train. The task of their class today was to clean the playground.A group of people walked on the road and unexpectedly saw Qin Ran.\u201cMu Ying, look, your campus belle cousin!\u201d Li Yuhan held Mu Ying\u2019s arm and whispered, her expression excited.As soon as Mu Ying looked up, she really saw Qin Ran. She immediately waved and yelled, \u201cCousin!\u201dJust after finishing a phone call with Ning Qing, Qin Ran wasn\u2019t in a good mood. Mu Ying called her not far away. She looked up and her face slightly softened.She nodded slightly and glanced over. \u201cHow are you adapting to class?\u201d\u201cThe new classmates are all very good,\u201d Mu Ying smiled and spoke. She glanced at the cup in Qin Ran\u2019s hand. The cup lid was also inlaid with a circle of diamond-like decorations, shiny, delicate and beautiful.She couldn\u2019t help but glance at it one more time.Qin Ran nodded. Because she had stopped for a while, the sight around her became more apparent.\u201cQin Ran, wait for me.\u201d Not far away, Qiao Sheng ran over with a basketball. He walked to Qin Ran and grabbed the hem of his clothes to wipe his sweat.Because he liked to play basketball, his abdominal muscles were obvious.He was handsome and was a well-known rich second generation in the school. There were more people glancing here and Mu Ying even hard people say \u201cQin Ran\u201d and \u201cQiao Sheng\u201d together.Of course, Mu Ying knew who Qiao Sheng was. She couldn\u2019t help but stare at him. He was indeed an outstanding campus figure.\u201cBring me a cup of Coke.\u201d Qiao Sheng instructed his younger brother, and then tilted his head and asked Qin Ran, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dQin Ran shook her head.\u201cOkay.\u201d Qiao Sheng weighed his basketball and smiled at Mu Ying. \u201cDo you know each other?\u201d\u201cYeah, she\u2019s my cousin.\u201d Qin Ran put her hand in her pocket and glanced at Mu Ying. She said lazily, her expression slightly arrogant, \u201cI\u2019m leaving, come and find me at class 3.9 if anything happens.\u201d\u201cYes, cousin, come to me too.\u201d Qiao Sheng followed Qin Ran while holding his basketball. He grinned at Mu Ying before following Qin Ran quickly.He wasn\u2019t even annoyed that Qin Ran had kicked him aside.Unexpectedly, Qiao Sheng and Qin Ran were close. He seemed much closer to her than to Qin Yu.\u201cMu Ying, are you a relative of the campus belle?\u201d The boys in Mu Ying\u2019s class looked at her in surprise.The girls in the class also looked at Mu Ying with envy, and she was surrounded by people quickly.Mu Ying remembered the logo on Qin Ran\u2019s cup. When she was picking up trash on the playground, she took out her mobile phone and searched the Internet. The cup that looked very beautiful turned out to be a luxury brand.She didn\u2019t find the one that Qin Ran had, but she saw that this brand\u2019s cups were at least 4,000 yuan.It was almost Ning Wei\u2019s one month salary.Didn\u2019t she hear that the Lin family didn\u2019t like cousin? Then why did they buy such an expensive cup for her?**In the quiet alley by the school.Feng Ci looked at the girl on the opposite side and pressed her eyebrows. \u201cWhy did you move out of the Feng family?\u201dPan Mingyue bowed her head and whispered, \u201cI want to study hard for senior year.\u201d\u201cStudy hard?\u201d Feng Ci raised his eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t just say it to please me, okay?\u201dPan Mingyue looked up, glanced at him, and turned to leave.She was pulled by her wrists, and he wrapped his hands around her waist. The man leaned on her shoulder and conceded. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen each other for several months, yet you\u2019re still so cold to me.\u201d\u201cSenior year\u2026\u201d Pan Mingyue opened her mouth.Feng Ci interrupted her. \u201cYou want to study hard, right? Your results are already good enough for Peking University.\u201dPan Mingyue sighed. \u201cBrother Feng, I\u2019m really not a genius.\u201dNot far away was the voice of students talking. Pan Mingyue was the top student and was quite famous. Feng Ci let go of her reluctantly.\u201cWhat relationship do you have with my father?\u201d Feng Ci stared at her and pinched her cheeks. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re really my dad\u2019s illegitimate daughter?\u201dPan Mingyue had never mentioned her parents. Feng Ci had investigated it before to no avail. It was as if someone had covered it up deliberately.Pan Mingyue had wanted to explain the parent-teacher meeting. At the mention of this, she swallowed her words and lowered her head, her eyes dim.**The parents\u2019 meeting was on Saturday.The students also had to be present for the meeting, but they were either standing in the corridor or at the back of the classroom. The parents sat on the corresponding student seats in the classroom.Ning Qing wore a set of new seasonal outfit today and took Qin Yu out of the car by the arm.The black BMW wasn\u2019t much noticeable behind a Cayenne.High school seniors with their parents were everywhere on campus.Ning Qing maintained her expression.She had come for such meetings for Qin Yu before, once a year, and every time she brought Qin Yu here, she would receive lots of attention.She walked into the school gate with Qin Yu. As soon as she smiled, she heard a voice not far behind. \u201cOh, Qin Ran\u2019s parents didn\u2019t come. Mom, I wanted you to bring you to see my future father-in-law or mother-in-law!\u201d\u201cDad, Qin Ran is our campus belle I told you about. Later on, you can take a look at class 3.9\u2019s board, she found someone to do it!\u201dThen, the crowd surged, and another student pushed Ning Qing aside, holding her mobile phone in his hand, shouting excitedly, \u201cIs this really Qin Ran\u2019s brother? Her brother looks like that?\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They rushed over enthusiastically at the same time.It was just that their voices weren\u2019t as Ning Qing had imagined. In First Middle School, the students either had good grades or had good families, and all had excellent conditions.It wasn\u2019t easy to be outstanding amongst these people. For a long time, Ning Qing had been the mother of the child other parents compared their kids to.In the past, when she came to First Middle School, she and Qin Yu were the targets of other people\u2019s attention, but now, Qin Ran was chanted in all of their mouths.Ning Qing was a bit uncomfortable.\u201cMrs. Qiao.\u201d She saw a familiar figure in front and subconsciously called.\u201cMrs. Lin.\u201d The speaker was wearing a long blue dress. She looked gentle and spoke softly and swiftly, not like the handsome and dauntless-looking young man beside her.Qiao Sheng squinted and glanced at her, but his eyes didn\u2019t stop wavering. \u201cMom, hurry.\u201dMrs. Qiao said sorry to Ning Qing and walked sideways with Qiao Sheng.She could also hear her whisper to Qiao Sheng, \u201cWhat are you anxious about, Qin Ran and her brother can\u2019t possibly run away, right?\u201dQiao Sheng\u2019s family business was accomplished in Beijing and abroad. Although Father Qiao was a startup, he was indeed a business genius. In Yun Cheng, legend had it that Mrs. Qiao was Beijing\u2019s most prestigious lady.Ning Qing didn\u2019t know much about these high society things, but she knew that everyone in Yun Cheng was afraid of the Qiao family.In the past, because of Qin Yu, Ning Qing could barely say a few words to Mrs. Qiao, so they weren\u2019t very close. Qiao Sheng was mischievous and was difficult to approach as well.But now, Ning Qing listened to the two of them talking about Qin Ran as if they were old friends.\u201cYu\u2019er\u2026\u201d Ning Qing had rarely been scorned so much in Qin Yu\u2019s school and was more surprised than offended. She hesitated and asked Qin Yu, \u201cIs there another person called Qin Ran in your school?\u201dQin Yu lowered her head slightly and didn\u2019t immediately answer.She also felt depressed. Recently, Qin Ran had been too popular. She was cold and proud and not only did the boys all like her, but the girls were also her fans.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time, mom, let\u2019s go to the class first.\u201d Qin Yu avoided Ning Qing\u2019s question.\u201cAh, ah, I see him. Qin Ran\u2019s brother is so handsome!\u201d\u201cOh my god, they\u2019re really a goddess and a god, I love it!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The surrounding voices came, and Ning Qing was visibly upset. She didn\u2019t even notice that Qin Yu had answered her.Qin Ran had no knowledge and skills and couldn\u2019t do anything to excel in this group of heavenly pride. The prestigious families in Yun Cheng had many senior students and Ning Qing recognized a few of the ladies.This was why Ning Qing hadn\u2019t wanted to go for Qin Ran\u2019s meeting.At first, the director of teaching was unwilling to accept Qin Ran, so Ning Qing was in a complicated mood. It was probably someone with the same name. She didn\u2019t believe that Qin Ran would be so popular with the students.**The parent meeting was nothing more than emphasizing the high school seniors.\u201cMom, my seat is there.\u201d Qiao Sheng stood on the window, pointing to his seat in the classroom, surrounded by many girls.\u201cThat\u2019s Qin Ran\u2019s brother.\u201d Qiao Sheng pointed to Qin Ran\u2019s seat but didn\u2019t see Qin Ran.He glanced around trying to locate her.Mrs. Qiao smiled calmly as she walked towards Qiao Sheng\u2019s seat while looking at the girl\u2019s seat.The girl had surfaced frequently in Qiao Sheng\u2019s house recently. Qiao Sheng was always talking about her.She saw a lazy, beautiful man sitting on the seat.Mrs. Qiao\u2019s footsteps shook and her complexion changed at a speed that was visible to the naked eye, and she could barely stabilize her footsteps.There were many people looking at him, but Cheng Juan could still distinguish Mrs. Qiao\u2019s gaze. He glanced at her slightly and saw Mrs. Qiao.It wasn\u2019t someone he knew.Cheng Juan retracted his gaze, leaned back, and spun a pen around his hand. Under the light obliquely shining through the window, his bones were clear, his features smooth and his complexion glowing.His long legs awkwardly rested under the table.The middle-aged woman at the front table pulled the chair too quickly and accidentally hit the table.There were so many things on the little girl\u2019s table that it couldn\u2019t withstand the force.\u201cBoom!\u201dCheng Juan lowered his head. The floor was full of letters. There were pink letters, baby blue letters, white letters with red hearts\u2026 There were dozens.\u201cSiran\u2019s deskmate is so popular.\u201d This was Lin Siran\u2019s father.He saw that Cheng Juan was so young and touched his head and said, \u201cYou\u2019re Siran\u2019s deskmate\u2019s brother or uncle\u2026?\u201dCheng Juan picked up the things on the ground expressionlessly. He raised his head and looked upset but was polite. \u201cI\u2019m neither.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201dCheng Juan repeated patiently and calmly, \u201cI am not her relative.\u201dHis tone was very approachable, but Master Juan had a strong aura and it was obvious at first glance that he wasn\u2019t an ordinary person. The people in the room were even afraid to meet eyes with him.The parents in the class were discussing with each other about Master Juan. The parents sitting beside him were very quiet.Cheng Juan was slow and thoughtful as he tidied the lettersVery good, there were thirty-two letters. It looked like she had only collected them from last night.He confiscated them all.Master Juan was very cold.Gao Yang doesn\u2019t criticize the students and mostly gave them encouragement. He wrote an observation manual for each student and distributed it to the parents one by one.The development on his side was slow, but the parent meeting of the first class was very fast. Li Airong gave a few typical compliments, and then picked a few typical retrogressive students to criticize. The parent meeting ended early.Qin Yu\u2019s studies were good and she was also busy with the school\u2019s anniversary. Li Airong praised those key points.These years, people gathered together either for their husbands or their children. Ning Qing was obviously very used to it and her hesitation disappeared.\u201cI heard that Yu\u2019er is going to study in Beijing with a famous teacher. Mrs. Lin, you\u2019re blessed.\u201d A familiar little sister praised.Ning Qing laughed. Qin Yu had always been her pride, so of course she was happy to hear someone boasting about Qin Yu. She was about to say something.She saw a commotion in the corridor.\u201cWhat are they looking at?\u201d Ning Qing glanced over.The little sisters around also gathered together and laughed. \u201cLook, it\u2019s Qin Ran. I heard from my daughter that she just transferred over this semester and even has the same surname as your daughter. But this child is really so beautiful, no wonder she\u2019s so popular\u2026 eh? Isn\u2019t that the Qiao family beside her?\u201dNing Qing turned away from the crowd and looked downstairs.The girl\u2019s back was cold, her eyes narrowed, and she was indifferently arrogant.The boy beside her was holding a few bottles of water for her.It was a well-known face. Ning Qing snorted inwardly, her head blank.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, he went to the store.He saw that Gao Yang wasn\u2019t going to end anytime soon and went to find Qin Ran.\u201cYour brother\u2026\u201d Qiao Sheng had thought that Qin Ran\u2019s brother was Lin Jinxuan, but he saw that it wasn\u2019t.He had never heard Qin Ran say that she had an older brother.\u201cHold your water properly.\u201d Qin Ran glanced at the second floor and saw Ning Qing in the crowd at one glance. She casually retracted her eyes, raised her eyebrows, her tone indifferent.Qiao Sheng scratched his head and remembered that Ning Qing had come with Qin Yu in the morning. He thought of how they both had the same mother and lowered his head in silence.He followed her step by step.\u201cThat\u2019s Qiao Sheng, right?\u201d Ning Qing\u2019s friend whispered.Qiao Sheng looked spoiled, but after all, he was the Qiao family\u2019s master. Other than towards Xu Yaoguang, it was rare to see him having such a good temper.Ning Qing naturally saw him as well. The boy downstairs followed behind Qin Ran casually, holding water in his hand, and often tilted his head to talk to the girl. The girl was lazy and didn\u2019t like to speak, but the young master didn\u2019t mind.He was still smiling.\u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom.\u201d Ning Qing\u2019s mood was a little complicated and she said absently.She didn\u2019t hold a parent-teacher meeting for Qin Ran because she was afraid of being shamed. She was afraid that people would look at her with strange eyes and criticize her. \u201cLook, that\u2019s Qin Ran\u2019s mother.\u201dBut now\u2026Ning Qing turned on the tap and patted water on her face.**The parent meeting of Class 3.9 was almost over.Gao Yang left Cheng Juan alone to speak in the office. He handed Cheng Juan a small observation diary and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that Qin Ran isn\u2019t smart. If she works hard, it\u2019s not impossible for her to go to college. She needs the cooperation of her parents to guide her. If you have time, you can show more concern about her life. There\u2019s no such thing as letting a child be\u2026\u201dFacing Cheng Juan, Gao Yang felt some inexplicable pressure that he didn\u2019t feel in front of Qiao Sheng\u2019s parents.He was obviously very tepid but was also very elegant.Cheng Juan flipped through this small observation diary. It didn\u2019t have many pages, but it was very meticulous. He even wrote down the books Qin Ran read.\u201cThank you, teacher.\u201d Cheng Juan closed the observation diary. Normally, Master Juan wouldn\u2019t even listen to others, but today, he listened very carefully to the teachings. \u201cI will guide her well.\u201dAfter speaking, he went out to where Qin Ran and Qiao Sheng were. He turned and followed Mrs. Qiao.\u201cYou are Qin Ran\u2019s\u2026\u201d Qiao Sheng thought that Cheng Juan was Qin Ran\u2019s cousin or something, and he even sighed in his heart that their genes were indeed very good.Cheng Juan didn\u2019t say anything. He just shoved the manual into his pocket and looked at Qiao Sheng calmly.He was a handsome man, but Qiao Sheng\u2019s voice was inexplicably tight.\u201cI\u2019m not her brother.\u201d Cheng Juan looked down. His eyes were dark and seemed to have nothing but Qin Ran in his eyes. His voice was smooth and husky.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Qiao Sheng was kicked by his mother before he could say another word.Anxious and fierce.Qiao Sheng swallowed back his words.Qin Ran also went to see her grandmother. When the four of them arrived at the school gate, they parted ways.After Qin Ran had left with Cheng Juan, Qiao Sheng rubbed his legs. \u201cMom, why did you hit me?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be such a busybody.\u201d Mrs. Qiao looked at the departing Volkswagen and the Beijing sign on the back. She was finally certain. \u201cNext time, to Qin Ran\u2026\u201d\u201cForget it.\u201d She wanted to say something but still held back. She glanced at the direction in which the car had just left. \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d**The black car with the Beijing license plate stopped at the hospital door.\u201cWhen you come down, just give me a call in advance. I\u2019ll be in the building opposite the inpatient department.\u201d Cheng Juan put his hand on the steering wheel.He looked sideways and opened the door for Qin Ran.The space in the car wasn\u2019t small and Qin Ran was deep in her own thoughts. When she came to her senses, Cheng Juan had already opened the door.His face was close to her.She could clearly see his features, delicate and beautiful, and his mint cold fragrance surrounded her.It only lasted a few seconds before the door opened.Qin Ran got out of the car. Cheng Juan stared after her back, shrouded in sunshine, thin and arrogant.He smiled slightly.Cheng Juan didn\u2019t get out of the car. In fact, he didn\u2019t have anything to do today. He slowly took out the observation diary that Gao Yang had just given him and looked at the suggestions written in it.For a long while, he lowered half of the car window, took out a cigarette and smoked.His eyes became clearer.Qin Ran didn\u2019t tell her grandmother about the parents\u2019 meeting. She came late today, so she made an excuse at will and her grandmother never doubted her.Ning Wei and Mu Nan were both here.Mu Ying and Mu Nan just ended military training yesterday. Both of them were tanned. Mu Nan was still fine, but Mu Ying had gone one shade darker.Visiting grandma together on Saturday morning had become a convention.After a while, Ning Qing arrived.She seemed to be thinking of something complicated.\u201cDid Yu\u2019er not come today?\u201d Chen Shulan was not in a good state of mind. Her hair was gray and she was sick.Ning Qing took a look at Qin Ran, put away her complex thoughts, and smiled. \u201cYu\u2019er went back to practice the violin. Her aunt found a famous teacher in Beijing, a world-class palace master. Yu\u2019er has been working hard recently for him to accept her as his apprentice.\u201dSpeaking of Qin Yu, Ning Qing had a strong smile on her face. Qin Yu\u2019s presence was indeed her pride.\u201cSecond cousin is amazing.\u201d Mu Ying was surprised.She didn\u2019t know much about these, but hearing about the master surprised her.\u201cYes, her teacher has been touring around the world recently. When he comes back to Beijing, Yu\u2019er will go and see him.\u201d Mu Ying brought Ning Qing a chair, and Ning Qing sat down.She talked as if he was already Qin Yu\u2019s teacher.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Chen Shulan couldn\u2019t help but look at Qin Ran, who was cutting her apple slowly and seriously.The sharp fruit knife became a toy to her.Chen Shulan sighed and turned her head. \u201cWhich teacher is Yu\u2019er going to worship?\u201d\u201cMaster Wei Lin.\u201d Ning Qing held up a glass of water and took a sip. \u201cYou must have never heard of him.\u201dWei Lin was a professional palace-level master. His reputation had spread to the upper classes, and Ning Qing also only knew of him recently.Just after she finished speaking, she saw Chen Shulan freeze.\u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201dLiked it?

She squeezed a piece into Chen Shulan\u2019s mouth and said blankly, \u201cGrandma, eat the apples.\u201dChen Shulan\u2019s words were trapped back into her throat.Ning Qing put the teacup down and didn\u2019t pay much attention. \u201cOh. I think it\u2019s probably one of your mahjong friends that has the same name. It\u2019s a typical name.\u201d\u201cMaybe,\u201d Chen Shulan said vaguely. Her teeth weren\u2019t good now, so she chewed very slowly.Qin Ran finished cutting the apple. She put it on a plate and inserted a few toothpicks into the slices.Chen Shulan kept looking at Qin Ran silently. Qin Ran sighed silently, lowered her head and said warmly, \u201cI\u2019ll go back to school first?\u201dShe still had to do her part-time job at the bubble tea shop.\u201cGo and study hard. Grandma is waiting for you to enter university.\u201dQin Ran lowered her head slightly and seemed to be smiling, but she said solemnly, \u201cYeah, I will.\u201dShe turned around and went out. Ning Qing remembered the parents meeting this morning and went out as well.On the hospital bed, Chen Shulan looked at Qin Ran\u2019s back, her eyes murky. She had indeed heard the name \u201cTeacher Wei Lin\u201d before.Wasn\u2019t the teacher who had come from the capital to their Ninghai Village and stayed there for a whole month, wanting to accept Qin Ran as his apprentice, also called Wei Lin?Outside the door, Ning Qing overtook Qin Ran in three or two steps.This was a VIP ward and there weren\u2019t many people in the corridor.Ning Qing lowered her voice. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you let your aunt go to your parents\u2019 meeting today?\u201d\u201cMy aunt is busy.\u201d Without grandma\u2019s presence, Qin Ran looked impatient. She glanced at her, her pretty eyebrows a little cold, still looking sloppy.She raised her hand and pressed the elevator door. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Ning Qing\u2019s mind was still full of what had happened in school. She asked, \u201cHow are you getting along with your classmates in school? Are you used to studying? Have you made any friends?\u201dAfter so many days of school, this was the first time that Qin Ran had heard Ning Qing ask about her learning.\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said patiently and succinctly. \u201cI\u2019ll go first.\u201dNing Qing also wanted to ask if she was familiar with Qiao Sheng, but Qin Ran didn\u2019t want to talk to her anymore. She could only watch as the elevator door closed slowly in front of her.Her expression was complex.**Qin Ran went downstairs. She had a bus card and didn\u2019t plan to call Cheng Juan. Bus 12 went directly to First Middle School, which was particularly convenient.As soon as she got out of the hospital gate, she hadn\u2019t even reached the bus stop opposite when a black car stood in front of her.The window was lowered. Cheng Juan tapped the steering wheel with his pretty fingers, leaned on his side, raised his eyebrows, and said slowly, \u201cGet on.\u201dThe car drove directly to the school medical office.Qin Ran noticed that the school doctor\u2019s room door was open. She paused. Didn\u2019t he say that Lu Zhaoying had matters to attend to today?She was just thinking about it.She saw a man in black coming out of the school medical office.He was wearing short sleeves and the cyan tattoo on his arm was faint. He was full of a fierce aura and didn\u2019t look good to provoke.\u201cMaster Juan,\u201d the man in black said when Cheng Juan got out of the car, respectfully and cautiously. \u201cThe investigation\u2026\u201dBefore he finished, he saw another person getting out of the car with Master Juan.It wasn\u2019t too surprising that another person was in the car with Master Juan, but the fact that it was a woman\u2026 the man in black was stunned.\u201cLet\u2019s eat first.\u201d It was hot outside, and Cheng Juan reached out and unbuttoned a button on his neckline. He thought of something and said in a low voice, \u201cDid you bring the things?\u201d\u201c\u2026 I did.\u201d The man in black regained his senses.But he couldn\u2019t help glancing over at Qin Ran.When the three entered the house, Qin Ran saw a stack of books on the empty table in the school medical office.It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to describe it as \u201cstacks\u201d.\u201cDrink water.\u201d Cheng Juan took the cup and poured a glass of warm water for Qin Ran.He went over to the stack of books on the table.After picking and choosing, he drew five books and handed them out to Qin Ran.Qin Ran glanced casually at the book. \u201c\u2026\u201dCollege Entrance Examination Review Step One.\u201cMr. Gao asked me to make sure you\u2019re studying.\u201d Cheng Juan turned and poured himself a glass of water. His voice was lazy and he narrowed his eyes.\u201cI picked it out, it\u2019s perfect for you.\u201d Cheng Juan came over holding the water. While she had been visiting her grandmother in the hospital, he had come up with a review plan for her.He walked over, pointed at a book with his finger, and lowered himself to Qin Ran\u2019s height. He lowered his head and wanted to introduce these review materials to Qin Ran.Qin Ran picked up a book, blinked, tilted her head, and slowly said, \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t need it.\u201dThe eyes of the two inevitably met. A strand of hair was slanted across his eyes, mouth, nose, and forehead.This distance made even his slight breathing sound obvious.Qin Ran was usually indifferent, cold and unconcerned.Cheng Juan couldn\u2019t stand it. He stood up straight, took a step back and said seriously, \u201cMr. Gao said that you\u2019re very smart. As long as you\u2019re willing to study, it\u2019ll be easy for you to get into college.\u201dQin Ran tilted her head and focused her attention on the book, only to find that she had never seen the information on the book.She took all five books. One of the above books had a hyperbola drawn and seemed to have a bunch of messy numbers. The next book was a review of physics\u2026Qin Ran paused and then said, \u201cThank you.\u201dToday\u2019s meal was still delivered by the hotel, and the man in black tried hard to make himself invisible.He refrained from looking at Qin Ran.Qin Ran returned to her bedroom after eating.This weekend, there was no one in the bedroom. Wu Yan had gone to self-study and Lin Siran had gone home with her father. Qin Ran put the books on the table.Then she took out the computer and turned it on.The computer turned on quickly, she reached out and quickly pressed a few keys, and a voice popped up.A voice from the man over there said, \u201cAre you finally contacting me?\u201d\u201cTalk.\u201d Qin Ran went to the bathroom and took a towel to wipe her face.She turned on the voice changer, and her voice was blurred.\u201cEveryone else is anxiously asking me if you\u2019re starting to accept orders.\u201d The man paused, grumbled and complained. \u201cMaster, you said that you were in a bad state and wanted to take a break, but you know how long you have gone without any orders? One year and four months.\u201dQin Ran sat on the chair, flipped the book with her other hand, and laughed. \u201cChang Ning, I remember taking a 10 million order just a few days ago.\u201dIf someone who knew about this matter was present, his expression would definitely change instantly.Chang Ning, the founder of 129 Detective Office, didn\u2019t know whether this detective office was linked to the dark web, but everyone knew that even if it was cross-border, as long as there was money involved, there was no information that 129 couldn\u2019t find and no case they couldn\u2019t solve.\u201cSo, are you in a good state now?\u201d Chang Ning asked seriously.Liked it?

She looked at the title of the information book with great care. \u201cLast time the order was an accident, but my state is better.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Chang Ning had only asked casually as a joke, but after hearing Qin Ran\u2019s answer, he was stunned instead and shot up from the sofa.\u201cLet\u2019s start next month.\u201d Qin Ran put the book aside, picked up another one, and spoke slowly, \u201cI\u2019m not in a rush.\u201d\u201cOh my God, even if you start next next month, I won\u2019t have any opinion.\u201d Chang Ning walked a few steps in his room, unable to hide his excitement. He finally couldn\u2019t help but burst into laughter. \u201cAs long as you\u2019re willing to come back. Do you know how scared I was that you\u2019ll stop taking orders after disappearing for one whole year?\u201dAs long as Qin Ran didn\u2019t quit, Chang Ning was at ease.Qin Ran wasn\u2019t surprised by Chang Ning\u2019s attitude. There were many members in the 129 Detective Agency. Even if an external psychological criminal detective was only an ordinary member, once placed in the outside world and producing his information, he was more useful and had more work experience than being in an inspection team for one year.It was too difficult to join 129.Qin Ran was a lone senior wolf in 129. As long as she took the order, there was nothing she couldn\u2019t do.She was also a veteran of 129. Because the headquarter was in Beijing, Qin Ran had never met the members of 129. Chang Ning knew her real name was Qin Ran but didn\u2019t know her age.Qin Ran had joined four years ago. At that time, her voice had been slightly immature, so for the convenience of work, she had used a voice changer.She had used it until now.\u201cThen you\u2019ve worried too much. I\u2019m short of money.\u201d Qin Ran leaned against the back of the chair casually.\u201cIt \u2018s good to be short of money.\u201d If she was short of money, she wouldn\u2019t resign. Chang Ning grinned. If the people in Beijing saw that the steel-face and selfless director had such a side to him, their jaws would probably drop. \u201cYou said you could come to Beijing this year. When are you coming?\u201dBefore other forces could find the lone wolf, Chang Ning wanted to tie her to 129.\u201cSomething went wrong.\u201d Qin Ran looked down at the book and her focus drifted off. \u201cI can go next year.\u201dChang Ning paused. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201dQin Ran was very generous and casual. \u201cThe college entrance examination.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chang Ning froze for a moment, then said again, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to say it, I\u2019ll just spread the news of your return first.\u201dQin Ran hung up. She swore that from beginning to end, she had never lied.Her heavy black cell phone that had been put aside lit up again.\u201cI really didn\u2019t find it. I\u2019ll take you to scan next time.\u201d Qin Ran slammed the phone onto the table.The phone \u201cbuzzed\u201d and vibrated a few times again. Seeing that Qin Ran really didn\u2019t care about it anymore, it wasn\u2019t very happy and quietened again.**\u201cPan Mingyue, why didn\u2019t your guardian come again?\u201d Li Airong looked at the student in front of her, frowning. \u201cForget it, give me your guardian\u2019s phone number.\u201dPan Mingyue pursed her lips. She lowered her head so that her face couldn\u2019t be seen. \u201cTeacher, my uncle is busy and has no time.\u201d\u201cHowever, the college entrance examination is very important. Don\u2019t delay your college entrance examination because of these things.\u201d Li Airong was the class teacher of Pan Mingyue. She naturally knew that her parents had died and that she was staying with her relatives now. \u201cLast time, your results fluctuated. The dorm is too noisy and has affected your studies. I hope to talk to your guardian and let you continue to study well.\u201d\u201cTeacher, I promise I can do better next exam,\u201d Pan Mingyue only said simply.In the end, Li Airong didn\u2019t say anything and just frowned unhappily.She couldn\u2019t find the phone number of Pan Mingyue\u2019s guardian on the file, nor did she know what was going on at the school. How could such obviously flawed files be included?Pan Mingyue was stopped at the school by a middle-aged man before returning to the class. \u201cMrs. is looking for you.\u201dShe followed him in silence.Not far from the school gate, a Porsche was parked.She sat in the driver\u2019s seat, and the graceful woman in the back seat finally raised her head. \u201cPan Mingyue, who are you showing off to?\u201dPan Mingyue froze. \u201cAunt \u2026\u201dMrs. Feng sneered and said, \u201cUncle Feng isn\u2019t here, so you don\u2019t have to be so fake and call me. You had a parent meeting today, right? Pan Mingyue, I know about you. Don\u2019t think that you can influence anyone by doing this. I\u2019ll tell Feng Loucheng the truth today.\u201dPan Mingyue got out of the car and watched the Porsche drive further and further away.The sun was shining above her head, but she felt cold all over.Lu Zhaoying strolled around and finally went back to school at 12 o\u2019clock.There weren\u2019t many people in the school. When he walked to the school hospital with his mobile phone, he saw a somewhat familiar figure squatting on the edge of the path.The other person had her head burrowed between her knees.He looked for a long while, but the other party didn\u2019t look up.He knew who it was by her short hair.\u201cClassmate, aren\u2019t you Qin Ran\u2019s friend? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lu Zhaoying\u2019s hand froze and he stuck a hand in his pocket. He crouched down in front of her.Pan Mingyue looked up, her face pale and her eyes red.Lu Zhaoying looked at her, thought about it, and went to the milk tea shop next door to buy a cup of hot milk tea. He handed it to her. \u201cQin Ran\u2019s favorite.\u201dPan Mingyue glanced at Lu Zhaoying for a long while, not knowing what to think. She took it and suddenly laughed. It was only for a moment and she was sullen again.She whispered \u201cThank you\u201d and walked around him.She was timid.Lu Zhaoying looked at her. She was clearly wearing a pair of trousers, but she showed her fair ankles because of her shortness.She and Qin Ran were really friends.They were both so poor.Master Lu always had no interest. With a wave of his hand in Beijing, women would stick to him like sticky notes. He looked at Pan Mingyue sideways as she left, not even turning back. After half a moment, he raised his head and chuckled.**Qiao Sheng laid on the table and looked at Qin Ran\u2019s direction. She wasn\u2019t reading those extra-curricular books today and had a review material in front of her. He had never seen that book before.Qin Ran wore headphones and sat sideways on a stool, propping her legs up casually. In this direction, most of her side face could be seen, and she was looking at a question in the book, frowning and seemingly very annoyed.\u201cYoung Master Xu, you didn\u2019t come yesterday, so you don\u2019t know.\u201d He had heard that Qin Ran just started studying and reading today and was in a bad mood, so Qiao Sheng didn\u2019t dare to provoke her at this time. He poked Xu Yaoguang\u2019s shoulder. \u201cQin Ran\u2019s brother was here.\u201d He paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know what relationship they have, but anyways, their family genes are really good.\u201dXu Yaoguang\u2019s family never came for the parent-teacher meeting, yet he had always been first in school, so the school had no opinion on it.Xu Yaoguang heard the name Qin Ran and moved his eyebrows but didn\u2019t raise it.\u201cYoung Master Xu, go and get the Physics paper.\u201d Due to Qiao Sheng, most people called Xu Yaoguang Young Master Xu.Xu Yaoguang put down his pen and went to the office to get the paper.Qin Yu was also there. She was slow and when she saw Xu Yaoguang coming, she paused and came out with him casually. \u201cThis time, the paper is really difficult. I heard that only the passing rate is 50%.\u201d\u201cDid you complete the last question?\u201d Xu Yaoguang picked up the paper. Chemistry had always been his poor subject.He had answered all the other questions, but he couldn\u2019t solve the last question.\u201cNo,\u201d Qin Yu shook his head and spoke again. \u201cI scanned through the papers and Pan Mingyue didn\u2019t solve it either.\u201dXu Yaoguang nodded. He quickened his pace to head to self-study.Qin Yu\u2019s hands were tight behind her.When Xu Yaoguang was handing out the papers, he froze at Lin Siran\u2019s paper and said, \u201cLin Siran, how did you do this question?\u201dHe pointed to Lin Siran\u2019s last physics fill-in-the-blank question, his gaze sharp.Lin Siran was working on a math paper. When she heard him asking her, she was stunned. Then, she patted Qin Ran. \u201cYeah, Ran Ran, how did you do it?\u201dLiked it?

He was such a calm and composed person, yet even he couldn\u2019t react in time.\u201cI couldn\u2019t do this question. But when I was submitting it, Ran Ran helped me fill it in.\u201d Lin Siran seemed to see that Xu Yaoguang was surprised and tilted her head to explain.Physics wasn\u2019t the same as Chinese, especially when filling in the blanks. This question was impossible to even start solving and time was tight, so Lin Siran had just given it a glance and skipped it.When she handed in the paper later, Lin Siran didn\u2019t even do many big questions, so how could she worry about filling in the blank questions?Lin Siran felt that Qin Ran had obsessive-compulsive disorder. She filled the paper up every time and didn\u2019t leave any empty blanks, and couldn\u2019t even bear to see her leaving an empty question down.She had taken her pen to fill it in for her.Knowing Qin Ran\u2019s rate of correct answers, Lin Siran had just let her write it. Unexpectedly, this time, she got it right.Lin Siran shook Qin Ran\u2019s arm again. \u201cRan Ran, Ran Ran\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you a pig?\u201d Qin Ran pressed her temple, placed her pen on the book and leaned back against the chair. She propped her legs and scanned over the question.If they couldn\u2019t even do this question, how could they go to Peking University? Qin Ran glanced at Lin Siran.As the highest academic institution in the country, Peking University ranked among the top universities in the world. Most of the people in First Middle School were expected to enter Peking University.\u201cThis question,\u201d Qin Ran raised her chin and cleared her throat. \u201cI did it randomly.\u201dDid it randomly\u2014Five-half times the number 11.Who was so bored to write down such a complicated answer randomly?The average person would guess a 2, or a root number 2.Lin Siran and Xu Yaoguang obviously didn\u2019t believe it.\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Qin Ran sat casually and knocked on the table with one hand, motioning for Lin Siran to take the math paper out from under the table.Lin Siran took it out inexplicably and didn\u2019t forget to observe Qin Ran\u2019s expression.Qin Ran\u2019s face was still casual as she narrowed her eyes. \u201cI tried to solve this question for half the day and got this equation. Since it was wrong, I just copied it onto your answer sheet.\u201dLin Siran and Xu Yaoguang looked down.Qin Ran\u2019s first big question was indeed filled in with the equation.The first major problem in mathematics was basically divided into sub-questions. The correct answer was 36. Except for those who made careless mistakes, probably only Qin Ran in the whole school could give such a messy answer.Since she had worked so hard to figure it out for the first time, it made sense that she would keep it in her mind.Without Qin Ran explaining it, Lin Siran provided the reason for Qin Ran\u2019s brain.\u201cOh, that\u2019s why.\u201d Lin Siran nodded.Xu Yaoguang heard the words and furrowed his eyebrows, but didn\u2019t say anything more. He put down Qin Ran\u2019s paper and glanced over at the workbook that Qin Ran was doing.The book had a blue cover.It looked familiar.Xu Yaoguang stepped forward.One more glance at that material and he saw that it was indeed the exercise booklet of the High School attached to Peking University. This exercise book was an exercise book produced by the Middle School itself. It wasn\u2019t difficult, but it required very comprehensive and logical thinking training.Xu Yaoguang had done it himself.This exercise book was only sold in the Beijing area. Other provinces and cities had no idea that there was such a review material.He had yet to see anyone use this exercise book in Yun Cheng.Xu Yaoguang couldn\u2019t help but take another look.Qin Ran put on the headset again and began to draw on the exercise book with a pen.She was still left-handed and wrote slowly, but didn\u2019t stay on the paper for long. Occasionally she drew on a piece of draft paper. Even though she was slow, she didn\u2019t stay and her writing was smooth.Within a minute, a blank question was written.Xu Yaoguang glanced to the side. Qin Ran tore off the answer behind and pressed it under her arm.He looked away indifferently.He had been willing to remind her last time, but this time, he didn\u2019t even want to mention it. He distributed Qin Ran\u2019s paper and left directly.After writing a few pages of questions, Qin Ran turned the music\u2019s volume up and laid down on the table to sleep.Before going to sleep, she reached out and drew a few questions on Lin Siran\u2019s paper. \u201cI don\u2019t understand this, this, and that. Listen carefully, and tell me after class.\u201dWhen Li Airong came to the class to explain the exercises, she saw Qin Ran sleeping again and frowned. She really didn\u2019t know what the principal and Gao Yang were thinking.Placing such a person in the class simply affected the learning atmosphere.Qin Ran sighed. What kind of fairy deskmate was she to worry about her deskmate\u2019s studies?**Principal\u2019s office.Principal Xu was holding a book in his hand. He didn\u2019t read it and only held his glasses. He was surprised to see the person sitting in front of him. \u201cYoung Master Cheng, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cDo you have the files of Qin Ran?\u201d Cheng Juan held a cup of tea and asked. His eyes were deep and his long fingertips reflected against the porcelain teacup.\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Principal Xu froze and didn\u2019t quite know how to react.\u201cChange her emergency contact phone number to Lu Zhaoying\u2019s temporarily.\u201d Cheng Juan paused and said again, \u201cIt seems that her family doesn\u2019t care about her. She is a high school student working in our school medical office.\u201dThe Lu family did charity for everyone in Beijing.Principal Xu didn\u2019t expect that Lu Zhaoying had such kindness?Cheng Juan reported a string of numbers.Principal Xu noted it down. After Cheng Juan left, he looked at Cheng Juan\u2019s figure thoughtfully.It stood to reason that as the principal he shouldn\u2019t do so. The emergency contact was originally Ning Qing\u2019s number, which had never been changed ever since the primary school file.But\u2026Principal Xu looked at the direction where Cheng Juan left. He still changed the number in the end.It was only when looking at this number did he realize afterward that Lu Zhaoying\u2019s number seemed to end with the number 8. Was this number the wrong one?\u201cPrincipal Xu, someone is looking for you outside.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d Principal Xu returned to his senses.\u201cIt\u2019s the Lin family.\u201d**When Qin Ran went to the school medical office, Lu Zhaoying was prescribing medicine to a student. Cheng Juan wasn\u2019t in the school medical office.She went straight into the kitchen.After a while, the big man in black who she had seen before pushed open the door of the school\u2019s medical room and came in. His face was stiff and his body was full of anger.\u201cWhere is Young Master Cheng?\u201d he asked in a sigh of breath.He noticed someone in the kitchen and hesitated. It was the girl he had seen at noon the day before yesterday. The man in black lowered his voice subconsciously.\u201cHe went to find Principal Xu.\u201d Lu Zhaoying handed the medicine to the student, and when the student left the school\u2019s medical office, he turned his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThe Jiang team has found news\u2014\u201d When he said this, the man in black paused. He took a look at the kitchen and had some reservations.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to check anymore.\u201d Lu Zhaoying didn\u2019t avoid Qin Ran. He threw his pen on the table.The man in black didn\u2019t hold in his surprise. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve found LW.\u201d Cheng Juan pushed open the door and came in. The wind blew against him and his voice was low and lazy.The man in black was anxious and wanted to argue, but after hearing this sentence, his brain hanged and he didn\u2019t react. He just froze there.In the kitchen, Qin Ran\u2019s hands slipped and a glass cup fell by her feet \u2014Clang!Cheng Juan looked over there. \u201cAre you okay?\u201dLiked it?

She stood there with her eyes lowered, thinking of something, a little stunned.The black cell phone had been set aside by her. After Cheng Juan went out, it lit up.Two minutes later, it brightened impassively.Qin Ran came back to her senses and saw that it was desperately lighting up. She turned her head away expressionlessly and stopped looking at it.\u201cCheng Mu.\u201d Outside the door, Lu Zhaoying put his legs on the table and his chair rotated 180 degrees backward. He spun a pen in his hand. \u201cI sent an email last time to Jiang Dongye, but I can\u2019t reveal the specific details.\u201dCheng Mu was still stunned.After a long time, he found his voice, cleared his throat, and said, \u201cMaster Juan, how did you do it?\u201dLW, Lone Wolf, was No. 1 in Detective Agency 129.Because it docked internationally, people from the outside world had given this nickname.Although Cheng Mu was also the leader of the SWAT team that year, he didn\u2019t pass the exam three times and wasn\u2019t even an ordinary member.From criminal investigation to criminology, there wasn\u2019t anyone who had never heard of that genius in 129.Cheng Mu looked at the direction of the kitchen again, deliberately lowered his voice and said shakily, \u201cI heard that he hasn\u2019t taken any orders for more than one year. How did you make him\u2026\u201dAs he talked, Qin Ran came out with a few bowls.Cheng Mu immediately shut up and stopped the conversation.Thinking about it, Cheng Mu felt stupid again. There was no need to be so careful. The girl was wearing a school uniform and was a student. Even if she heard it, how would she know what he was saying?While eating, Cheng Juan first introduced the man in black to Qin Ran. \u201cThis is Cheng Mu. When I\u2019m not around next time, you can find him.\u201dQin Ran glanced at Cheng Mu and nodded.Then he started to ask about the few exercises he had given her. \u201cHave you started doing them?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yeah.\u201d Qin Ran was sullen.\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Lu Zhaoying smiled unconsciously and said, \u201cQin Ran, don\u2019t tell me you saved all the trouble and just copied the answers? Do you know what Master Juan did for that set\u2026\u201dLu Zhaoying didn\u2019t finish speaking before Cheng Juan put his hand on the table and glared at him.Lu Zhaoying immediately waved his hand and put a chain on his mouth, indicating that he would shut up.He looked at Cheng Juan and sighed.Half a month ago, just when Cheng Juan was called here to do hard work, Lu Zhaoying never would have thought that he would encounter such a thing.Master Juan actually made such a big fuss over study review materials\u2026Maybe those people in Beijing thought they were in such a hurry for some important files\u2026Cheng Mu didn\u2019t dare to talk from start to finish, and he didn\u2019t have dinner with the two of them.After eating, Cheng Mu watched Qin Ran and Cheng Juan go out together. His frowns were slightly hesitant. \u201cYoung Master Lu, that girl\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mess with her.\u201d Lu Zhaoying leaned on the back of the chair. He had wanted to wash the dishes, but since Cheng Mu was here, he let him wash it.He smiled again. \u201cOur Master Juan cares about her a lot.\u201dCheng Mu stared at him, thinking what was it with this girl.There were a lot of women chasing Master Juan in Beijing, and even his own goddess was chasing Master Juan. How could they all not compare to a senior year student? It looked like her results weren\u2019t even particularly good?Oh, but she sure was beautiful. No one in Beijing could look better than her.**Military training for high school had ended, and there were no freshmen wearing camouflage clothes to grab a meal in the cafeteria these days.Qin Ran was sitting on a chair, still fighting with the exercise book.She had on her black headphones and the volume was already very high, but for some reason, the classroom was still really noisy.Qin Ran only felt like her brain was being squeezed and was buzzing.Her eyes were also slightly red.Her fringe slipped over her forehead and she threw her pen with a slam. She supported her chin in one hand and tapped her fingers on the table.After so many days, Lin Siran knew almost all of Qin Ran\u2019s personality and habits. She leaned over and whispered, \u201cI heard that the school bully\u2026 that Wei Zihang just transferred to our school.\u201dLin Siran didn\u2019t finish when she remembered that Qin Ran knew Wei Ziheng well. \u201cHe\u2019s here as a sports student.\u201dWei Zihang wasn\u2019t from First Middle School, but his fame here wasn\u2019t lower than that of Xu Yaoguang. To a certain extent, it was even higher.He used to be in Zi High School and, although the students of First Middle School were afraid of him, it wasn\u2019t too big a deal.But now the school bully was transferring over to First Middle School. In their eyes, it was tantamount to putting a wolf in the middle of a group of sheep.\u201cOh.\u201d Qin Ran nodded, continued to pick up the pen to start the question, and turned up the volume of her headset a bit.Fortunately, the class bell rang, and these discussions disappeared.After school at night, Qin Ran waited for the other students to leave before packing up.\u201cRan Ran, let\u2019s go out and buy some materials first.\u201d Lin Siran closed her book and waited for Qin Ran.Li Airong had arranged a new review information book and had asked them to purchase it at the bookstore next to the school to use in class later.At the same time.Outside the school gate.There weren\u2019t many people on the road, but because school had just been dismissed, there were actually quite a few people walking together.\u201cAunt, are you here to visit Principal Xu?\u201d Qin Yu said hello to Xu Yaoguang and went towards them, holding a book.A few people who had yet to notice Xu Yaoguang paused when they heard the words \u201cPrincipal Xu\u201d.Xu Yaoguang had always been proud and had never taken the initiative to greet someone.Lin Wan didn\u2019t pay attention to Xu Yaoguang and shook her head slightly. \u201cI saw his assistant.\u201dHow many people in Beijing wanted to meet Elder Xu. In Beijing, she might even have to take a queue number.\u201cPrincipal Xu has always been difficult to see.\u201d Qin Yu wasn\u2019t surprised. She lowered her head again.The group was very eye-catching, especially Lin Wan, who had her own nobility.She was about to get in the car.\u201cAunt, second cousin, why are you here?\u201d After cleaning up and coming out late, Mu Ying saw them and quickly loosened Li Yuhan\u2019s hand and trotted over.Mu Ying wasn\u2019t wearing a school uniform today, but a new skirt Ning Wei had bought for her in the mall. It was a little too long.Ning Wei had to raise a family, and there was even a family member in a vegetative state. How could she have so much money on her hands? She just bought new clothes for Mu Ying, but the pattern and colors were all discounted goods from last year. It was cheap but unfashionable.Lin Wan had been in Beijing for a long time, and she was used to judging people.Mu Ying was a little uncomfortable.She pinched her skirt and saw the figure walking away not far away. She beckoned for her quickly. \u201cCousin, Aunt is here!\u201dQin Ran was too lazy to care about them. She rolled her eyes and turned up the volume on her earphones.A jeep stopped slowly beside her, honking its horn and lowering the window.Lin Wan noticed that it was Beijing\u2019s license plate. She suddenly said in shock, \u201cIsn\u2019t that Principal Xu\u2019s car?\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: DisobedientPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThere was a certain distance between Beijing and Yun Cheng, and the license plate number of Beijing was mostly rare.They knew that in the whole school, only Principal Xu was from Beijing.That was why Lin Wan had exclaimed that.It was just that it was difficult to see Principal Xu and nobody knew what car he drove.Ning Qing and Qin Yu both shook their heads slightly.Qin Yu pursed her lips and said nothing, but Ning Qing looked at Qin Ran with a frown. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is.\u201d\u201cQin Ran.\u201d The window lowered, and Principal Xu was in the back seat, sitting sideways.Qin Ran let go and looked slightly positive. She called, \u201cPrincipal Xu.\u201dPrincipal Xu looked at Qin Ran and thought of when Cheng Juan had come to find him. He knocked on his knee and was a little strange. \u201cAre you going out to eat? Get in, let\u2019s go together?\u201dHis eyes were very mild and pure like a kind elder.His tone wasn\u2019t mandatory and was more like a polite question.Qin Ran shook her head. \u201cI want to buy books with my deskmate.\u201dThe two said a few more words and the jeep drove away. Before they went far, Lin Siran was already standing beside Qin Ran, staring at her.When the car drove away, she still wasn\u2019t back to her senses and had to be dragged by Qin Ran.Qin Ran dragged Lin Siran with one hand, put on her headphones again with the other and adjusted the volume. Her eyes were still slightly red and she looked impatient and cold.She directly passed Ning Qing and Lin Wan.As if she didn\u2019t know them.Ning Qing and Qin Yu didn\u2019t speak to her, nor did they call her.Lin Wan glanced at the window as the car passed by. The window was anti-peeping and she couldn\u2019t see who was inside.She knew that Qin Ran\u2019s recommendation letter had been written by Principal Xu. This was always something she just couldn\u2019t figure out.This was the first time Lin Wan had met Qin Ran and she had to admit that she was beautiful. No wonder Lin Qi\u2019s attitude towards Qin Ran was better than she had expected.Lin Wan looked up and down Qin Ran again and examined her.When she judged people, she was always condescending.Qin Yu noticed Lin Wan\u2019s gaze and smiled. \u201cI heard that my sister was originally in our class, but our headteacher was afraid that it would affect the learning in our class, so she didn\u2019t want her.\u201dLin Wan retracted her gaze. She hadn\u2019t really seen Qin Ran\u2019s resume, but she had heard about it. When she stayed in the Lin family\u2019s house, Aunt Zhang had told her a lot.She was deep in thought and looked away.She glanced slightly past Qin Ran, moved away, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dFrom beginning to end, she didn\u2019t talk to Mu Ying.Lin Wan looked very powerful and Mu Ying had wanted to call Qin Ran, but after seeing how Ning Qing and the rest didn\u2019t even call her, she was stunned and didn\u2019t say anything.Ning Qing said something to Mu Ying and then kept up with Lin Wan.Mu Ying stood behind them, watching Lin Wan get on a black BMW.Her eyes lingered on the driver\u2019s hand. The driver had just picked up Qin Yu\u2019s backpack, and it was obvious that there was a delicate and beautiful pink cup hanging on the edge of the backpack.This pink cup wasn\u2019t the same as the one Qin Ran used.Although it was also good-looking, it didn\u2019t have a logo and didn\u2019t look like a luxury item. It looked like the cups that Mu Ying often saw in boutiques and wasn\u2019t expensive.Mu Ying suddenly felt a little cyanotic and a little bit confused.The Lin family had bought such an expensive cup for Qin Ran, but why didn\u2019t they buy it for Qin Yu?**\u201cThe school sent so much information, and the English teacher also asked us to buy extracurricular books.\u201d Lin Siran finally regained her senses and went to find the books with Qin Ran.Li Airong taught several English classes.The English materials here were sold out.The manager asked them to come back tomorrow morning for a new batch.The bookstore was relatively quiet. Qin Ran\u2019s headphones were still hanging around her neck, but she didn\u2019t stuff it in her ears. She leaned against the bookshelf and found another foreign book. She held it with one hand and her voice was relaxed. \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dLin Siran was afraid that she wouldn\u2019t be able to buy the books tomorrow, so she asked the bookstore owner to leave her two copies and paid the deposit before leaving.This bookstore was bigger than all the rest. In the alley, there were many people reading books in the bookstore.As a result, the sound coming from the end of an alley seemed a little clear.It was the voice of a few teenagers, and Qin Ran saw the corner of their clothes. It was red and black, not First Middle School\u2019s nor Zi High School\u2019s uniforms.They were noisy and loud.Qin Ran shoved the earphones around her neck into her ears.Lin Siran was also a bit scared and she pulled on Qin Ran\u2019s sleeves. \u201cRan Ran, let\u2019s go back to school first.\u201dThe group of teenagers in the alley seemed to stop, and one of them suddenly laughed. \u201cAh, isn\u2019t this our classmate Pan? Yo, she\u2019s still wearing her high school uniform. Are you still in First Middle School?\u201dHis tone was very discomforting.Lin Siran frowned. She dragged Qin Ran and wanted to tell the security guard about this when she went back to school.Within a few seconds, the annoying voice spoke again, \u201cPan Mingyue, you harmed me last time and you can still attend First Middle School as if nothing happened? You\u2019re impressive, eh?\u201dSeveral First Middle School students trotted out of the alley in a panic.Lin Siran froze. She dragged Qin Ran\u2019s hand and said in a tense tone, \u201cRan Ran, that\u2019s Mingyue?\u201dShe took out her cell phone, called the police first, and then went to the guard.\u201cHaha, Brother Xu, you\u2019re too much. Be careful, it\u2019s not good if the knife strikes the girl\u2019s face. Her face is really white.\u201d Several bursts of laughter sounded.\u201cTake it for me.\u201d Qin Ran handed the book in her hand to Lin Siran, then cracked her head and loosened the neckline of her uniform shirt. \u201cI\u2019ll take a look.\u201dLin Siran looked at her calm face, told her not to mess around, and then ran to the school to find security.The police would surely take a while to come.Qin Ran always kept in mind that she wanted her grandmother to spend a comfortable old age and not to worry about her. So she had refrained from making trouble in Yun Cheng.Until now, she watched Pan Mingyue leaning against the wall, her glasses pulled down. She was cruelly thrown aside and her eyes enlarged like a thread puppet.Looking closely, there was panic in those eyes.The teenager with silver hair called \u201cBrother Xu\u201d held Pan Mingyue\u2019s face in one hand and a knife in his other hand, making a gesticulation at her face.\u201cBang\u201d. From the moment she arrived in Yun Cheng, Qin Ran\u2019s tight nerves were finally broken.Someone noticed Qin Ran.A person with purple hair took the lead to notice Qin Ran. \u201cWhat are you looking at\u2014\u201d\u201cI promised my grandmother to study hard and be a good person\u2026\u201d Qin Ran whispered.She seemed to be in breach of her grandmother\u2019s agreement and couldn\u2019t be obedient.Liked it?

He was holding a cigarette and said with a vile voice, \u201cWhat are you looking at\u2014\u201dEvery scene flashed through her mind. Screams, explosions, blood soaking through the earth\u2026Qin Ran took off her headphones and uniform and tossed it aside. She looked up at the person called Brother Xu coldly and evilly. \u201cXu Shen, do you remember me telling you to stay away from me?\u201dShe stepped forward, reached out, and grabbed the dagger in Xu Shen\u2019s hand.Blood ran down the palm of her hand, scaring the group of young people. The originally fierce teenagers calmed down at this moment and all looked at her.Xu Shen was startled and took a step back.He stared at her as her expression darkened, and a savage and aggressive look passed by her face.He loosened his dagger and gestured a Taekwondo posture.\u201cSnap\u2014\u201dQin Ran released his hand in a hurry. The dagger fell to the ground and shook it a bit.She took a step back, widened her distance, and turned around to make a round kick in Xu Shen\u2019s chest.\u201cBoom\u2014\u201dThe person was taken down. The others reacted and rushed up. Qin Ran raised her other hand and pressed someone\u2019s hand, kicking him in the stomach at the same time.\u201cQin Ran!\u201d Xu Shen supported himself off the ground and spit out blood. He tried to climb up but failed to.The siren sounded not far away.Qin Ran squeezed her right hand, put on her uniform and stood beside Xu Shen. She lowered her head and didn\u2019t pull her zipper, so her white coat was stained with bright red blood.She squatted and stepped on Xu Shen\u2019s hand. Her pretty eyes narrowed slightly and she stretched out a white finger, then pressed Xu Shen\u2019s throat. She dragged out her tone, her tone pleasant. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you listen to me?\u201dNot far away, Qin Yu was originally walking with Ning Qing and Lin Wan, but she couldn\u2019t get the materials that Li Airong had wanted.She let the driver stop at the intersection.She had come down to buy the books and the driver had first sent Ning Qing to the hotel not far away.Seeing this, Qin Yu took a moment to look around and didn\u2019t go to the bookstore. Instead, she took out her phone and called Ning Qing.\u201cMom,\u201d Qin Yu watched the police car parked not far away. \u201cSister seems to be fighting with someone and went to the Public Security Bureau.\u201dOn the other side of the phone, Ning Qing\u2019s expression changed.She took a step outside the hotel and, after making sure that Lin Wan and Lin Qi couldn\u2019t hear her, she whispered, \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201dQin Yu was also unclear, so she just said a few words in a vague manner.\u201cDon\u2019t tell your dad and your aunt about this. I\u2019ll go to the police station first.\u201d**Yun Cheng Police Station Branch.The young policeman held a pen and sat opposite Qin Ran with a pen. \u201cQin Ran, tell me your parents\u2019 contact information, and why you hit them.\u201dQin Ran leaned back to the chair and pinched her right hand. The blood leaked out and stained her uniform.She had no expression on her face and her eyebrows looked good under the lights. She didn\u2019t look at the policeman, but she played with her fingers on her left hand and propped her legs up. She said casually, \u201cI don\u2019t like the sight of him.\u201dThe dispatch was near the school. The police had seen all kinds of offensive students here before, and with just one glance at Qin Ran, he could tell that she was a common offender. \u201cYou beat him up just because of that? Young lady, you\u2019re pretty impressive, eh?\u201dSoon, a list of injuries came out.At first glance, the police determined that the most severely beaten Xu Shen had to stay in the hospital for a few days.He patted the table. He had seen many cases like this, but he had never seen anyone who showed no signs of repentance after hitting someone. He sneered and was a little disgusted. \u201cFine, You\u2019re from First Middle School, right? I\u2019ve already informed your school. At this rate, you will have to be detained. I\u2019ll wait for your parents to come!\u201dSomeone knocked on the door outside. \u201cXiao Li, their family is here.\u201dOfficer Li went out and happened to see Ning Qing. A policewoman was handing out a list for Ning Qing to fill in.Seeing Officer Li, Ning Qing squeezed her bag. This was the first time she was here and she felt uncomfortable all over. \u201cPolice Officer, I am Qin Ran\u2019s mother.\u201dOfficer Li looked at Ning Qing and sneered. \u201cCommon offender?\u201dNing Qing\u2019s face became embarrassed instantly. She was stiff and she spoke anxiously, \u201cOfficer Li, where is she?\u201dOfficer Li glanced at her and took the list. \u201cShe\u2019s under interrogation inside. How did you teach her as her mother?\u201dNing Qing was embarrassed about being educated by the police officer and she stood there stiffly.Everyone in the police station looked at her, but she didn\u2019t want to care about it for a moment.But Lin Wan was still in Yun Cheng. So many people in the Lin family knew the existence of her eldest daughter and were waiting to gossip about her. If she didn\u2019t care about it now, news of Qin Ran being detained in the police station would surely spread to the Lin family.Xu Shen was taken to the hospital because of serious injuries, and the police took statements from others.Several other teenagers gave their statements.Only Pan Mingyue did not speak.She kept her head buried in her knees and didn\u2019t listen to anyone.\u201cYour daughter is still inside, she is very stubborn and doesn\u2019t admit wrong or cooperate with us. She can only be detained if this goes on.\u201d Officer Li threw the list on the table.Ning Qing\u2019s brain froze and she said, \u201cOfficer Li, let me in to persuade her!\u201dA smartly dressed old lady came in from the gate and groaned as she entered. \u201cWho? Who hit my grandson? Where is my grandson? Where is he?\u201dWhen Ning Qing saw the old lady, she was stunned. \u201cGrandma Xu?\u201dShe had previously found a violin teacher for Qin Ran, and this grandma was exactly that teacher\u2019s mother.The old lady was anxious about her grandson. She heard Ning Qing\u2019s voice and narrowed her eyes to look at her. It took her a while to recognize her.\u201cGrandma Xu, let\u2019s discuss things slowly. How much do you want\u2026\u201d Ning Qing lowered her head and murmured in a low voice.Her brain crashed. Would she go to jail?Then criminal records would be left behind! No way!\u201cWho wants your money,\u201d said the old lady with a sharp tongue. She called her family again. \u201cWhat are you still looking at? Your son has been beaten and sent to the hospital! Call the Officer at once!\u201dShe was really looking for death!**School medical office.Lu Zhaoying looked out of the door again and touched his ear studs. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Qin Ran come yet?\u201dCheng Juan glanced at him and said nothing.He continued reading his medical book in his hand with his head lowered. His knuckles were obvious and he wrote in the book. Lu Zhaoying watched him sullenly.He would see how long he could stand it for.Five minutes later, Cheng Juan raised his head, put the pen aside, and closed the book in his hand.He took out his phone and glanced at it.There was no new message displayed on it. It was still the text message sent by Qin Ran ten minutes ago. [I have matters to settle, I\u2019m taking leave.]The sentence he had asked behind was like a stone sinking in the ocean.Cheng Juan furrowed his brows. He only received a call from the school when he was about to start eating.He rose suddenly.Lu Zhaoying was holding his chopsticks and was stunned. \u201cMaster Juan, where are you going?\u201dLiked it?

He shot up straight. \u201cPolice station?\u201dLu Zhaoying naturally knew that the \u201cher\u201d that Cheng Juan was talking about was Qin Ran. He put down his chopsticks and got up. \u201cWhy is she in there?\u201dCheng Juan didn\u2019t know the situation, so he only motioned for him to get the car key. \u201cI asked Jiang Hui to come.\u201dCheng Mu followed behind them expressionlessly.He knew who Jiang Hui was, he was Jiang Dongye\u2019s uncle. He had heard before that Jiang Hui had been assigned to some third-tier city by Old Master Jiang.It turned out to be in Yun Cheng.But was it really necessary to call him here?Such a tiny matter like a fight among high school students actually required Jiang Hui to come here and use a sledgehammer on a nut?***A restaurant box in the middle.\u201cThey\u2019re all at First Middle School, why didn\u2019t they bring Ran Ran along?\u201d Lin Qi smiled. \u201cI heard her mother say that she is very popular in school.\u201dUpset, the cup in Qin Yu\u2019s hand touched the edge of the table.\u201cYu\u2019er, your mother said she had matters to attend to, but why is she so late?\u201d Lin Qi heard the sound of the cup and looked over to ask. He waited for a while and didn\u2019t see Ning Qing coming back.Qin Yu held her chopsticks, lowered her eyes and bit her lip. \u201cShe should be at the police station\u2026\u201d\u201cPolice station?\u201d Lin Qi froze and subconsciously dropped the menu.Lin Wan also looked up.\u201cMy sister just fought with someone at school and was taken to the police station by the police. I\u2019m afraid that something happened to them\u2026\u201d Qin Yu sighed.Lin Qi stood up and frowned. \u201cNothing will happen. I\u2019ll go\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking and stood up, Lin Jinxuan, who had just come in, got up and wiped his hands with a paper towel. \u201cDad, you can eat with aunt first. I\u2019ll go to the police station.\u201dLin Jinxuan was also a respectable man in Yun Cheng. His connections weren\u2019t worse than his father\u2019s. Lin Qi hesitated and then nodded. \u201cOkay, then you go and see. Call me if something happens.\u201dQin Yu looked at Lin Jinxuan\u2019s back. She had never seen Lin Jinxuan so concerned before. \u201cDad, I\u2019m a bit worried about my mother and sister. Let me go with my brother.\u201d\u201cBe careful.\u201d Lin Qi thought for a while but did not refuse.**The police station.Hearing Grandma Xu\u2019s words, Ning Qing panicked.Once those people were really involved, could she cope with it?She asked the officer to take her to see Qin Ran.\u201cHer child was injured badly by your daughter. When we arrived, his arms were already soft and his injury appraisal has yet to come out.\u201d Officer Li glanced at Ning Qing. \u201cIf they investigate it, she won\u2019t be able to get away with less than two years of jail.\u201dNing Qing opened the door uneasily.Qin Ran had one hand on the table and the other supporting her chin. Her eyes were closed.When she heard the voice, she opened her eyes slightly. When she saw who it was, she changed her posture anxiously. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dShe hadn\u2019t told them Ning Qing\u2019s number. She naturally had a way to solve this matter.\u201cQin Ran, why can\u2019t you just study well? The person you hit is Xu Shen. Teacher Xu has taught you well, how could you do this?!\u201d Ning Qing gritted her teeth. If she could turn back time to the beginning of school, even if Qin Hanqiu didn\u2019t want her, she would never have brought Qin Ran back. \u201cDo you know that you\u2019ll have to go to jail if they investigate? Your whole future will be ruined!\u201dQin Ran leaned back and smirked indifferently. Eyes still bloodshot, she still looked cynical and nonchalant. \u201cOh,\u201d she said simply.Ning Qing closed her eyes. \u201cGo and apologize to Grandma Xu and Teacher Xu right away. It\u2019s better if they don\u2019t pursue this matter. If they do\u2026\u201dNing Qing pursed her lips. After this matter had blown over, she would send her abroad. Leaving her in Yun Cheng was a disaster waiting to happen!\u201cMy face in the Lin family\u2019s house has been lost because of you, Qin Ran.\u201dOutside the door, several policemen didn\u2019t dare to take up the matter. Grandma Xu had said that she was looking for the bureau.When it came to the Bureau, these civilian policemen simply didn\u2019t dare to mess around.They waited honestly one by one.Ning Qing came out with Qin Ran and wanted to apologize to Grandma Xu and the teenagers. The main office room wasn\u2019t big and was almost full.Ning Qing put down her pride and went to appease Grandma Xu.Since coming to Yun Cheng for so long, she had been careful in everything she did, and she had never put down her pride before.\u201cWhat you say is useless now, my grandson is still in the hospital.\u201d Grandma Xu stared fiercely at Qin Ran. \u201cWe will definitely pursue this matter to the end!\u201dNing Qing was at her wit\u2019s end. She could only step on her pride and call Lin Qi for help.Just before calling, she got a call from Lin Jinxuan.At this time, most people in the police station were off work.Lin Jinxuan was tall and slender and had a strong aura that stood out among a group of people. At first glance, it was obvious he wasn\u2019t an ordinary person.He looked around and saw Qin Ran standing in the crowd. She was leaning against the wall with her lips pursed indifferently.Lin Jinxuan paused and then took two steps toward them, stopping beside Ning Qing. \u201cAunt, what\u2019s going on?\u201dNing Qing opened her mouth, but she was reassured now. She was very clear about her stepson\u2019s ability.Lin Jinxuan asked the police some questions.\u201cYou are all Qin Ran\u2019s family?\u201d Grandma Xu stared sharply at Lin Jinxuan. \u201cLet me tell you, there is no way I will let her go. My grandson\u2019s hand was broken by her and he\u2019s still in the emergency room. She must go to jail!\u201d\u201cWe have investigated this matter already. They are all students, the impact on them won\u2019t be good\u2026\u201d Lin Jinxuan didn\u2019t know the specific reason and was patient and calm.Several other parents who were angry over their injured children also rushed over.They all started talking at once after knowing their sons had been injured.\u201cShe\u2019s so young but so cruel. How did you even teach her? Which parent would dare to let her study and stay in school!\u201d\u201cShe looks like a vixen, how good of a person could she be!\u201d\u201cShe must pay for this!\u201dThey were unwilling to let this matter go.Amidst the noisiness, Qin Yu pulled Lin Jinxuan\u2019s clothes from behind and smiled obediently. \u201cUncles and Aunts, I believe that my sister isn\u2019t such an unreasonable person. She must have some unspoken reason. Brother, Mother, since they\u2019re unwilling to let it go, then let\u2019s publicize this matter.\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d Ning Qing immediately retorted.Ning Qing had a splitting headache. She knew just how many times Qin Ran had fought. This time, she knew that it must be Qin Ran who had caused trouble first. If this matter was publicized, she would really have to go to jail.There were too many people in the police station. Lin Jinxuan glanced at Qin Ran. She had her head lowered and didn\u2019t say a single word to justify herself.She was really indifferent. Lin Jinxuan took out his phone and called Feng Ci.\u201cIs it wrong to apologize for your wrongdoings?\u201d Ning Qing reached out and dragged Qin Ran. \u201cDidn\u2019t your grandmother teach you?\u201dQin Yu stood behind Ning Qing and pursed her lips.The office hall was in chaos. Grandma Xu tried to beat Qin Ran but was stopped by the police. In the mess, a girl who had been squatting in the corner suddenly stood up.Qin Ran saw her. \u201cPan Mingyue! Go back!\u201dPan Mingyue didn\u2019t look at her and calmly said, \u201cThere is indeed an unspoken reason. If you want to publicize it, then I will too. May I ask the police officer, what crime is it to beat up and molest an underage girl?\u201dAfter she said this, the parents, Grandma Xu, and even the policemen were all stunned.Liked it?

She only helped me teach those scums a lesson. She did nothing wrong and doesn\u2019t need to apologize to anyone.\u201dPan Mingyue\u2019s glasses had been taken away by Xu Shen long ago, so at this time, her dark eyes were revealed, clear and calm.The parents of those teenagers froze and reacted quickly.\u201cWhat nonsense, this girl is shameless!\u201dGrandma Xu simply wanted to rush up and tear Pan Mingyue\u2019s mouth off her face. \u201cWhat do you mean? My grandson isn\u2019t like that!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a CCTV at the intersection of that bookstore, and he has a criminal record at Ninghai Town from three years ago.\u201d Pan Mingyue ignored them, turned to look at the police, and said quietly, \u201cYou can investigate and see if it is true. I\u2019m very happy that this time you have decided to publicize it. Officer, you still haven\u2019t told me yet, just what crime is it?\u201dShe spoke calmly with her back straight and tall.Officer Li almost burned himself with the cigarette in his hand.He looked at Pan Mingyue, stunned, before saying slowly, \u201cIf it\u2019s a light punishment, a few months. If it\u2019s a heavy punishment, then three to five years.\u201dFor some reason, the parents who had just been shouting and the aggressive Grandma Xu suddenly lost their ability to speak.A policeman holding a notebook noted it down and watched Grandma Xu and the others. His gaze changed instantly and he frowned.Grandma Xu and the others stood rooted to the ground, their faces ashen and a little awkward.Officer Li\u2019s words struck panic in their hearts.Lin Jinxuan\u2019s dressing style wasn\u2019t ordinary, and it was obvious that his family was rich.They had wanted to publicize this matter only to get more compensation for their sons.But after hearing Pan Mingyue\u2019s words, they looked at each other and were a little afraid. The girl was the victim, and according to the police officer, their sons would have to go to jail and would even have a record taken down.Lin Jinxuan, who had been staring blankly at them, finally returned to his senses.He had always been agile when dealing with interpersonal relationships and most things, so now he responded faster than Ning Qing and Qin Yu.\u201cPolice officer, send someone to investigate and monitor the CCTV first. Oh, and the case at Ninghai Town also needs to be investigated,\u201d he said while taking two steps forward and lowering his head to look at Qin Ran.She had a touch of blood on her lips. Her lips were pursed tightly and she looked a little cold, but her furrowed eyebrows looked fretful instead.She had her hand in her pocket and her fringe over her face so that her expression couldn\u2019t be seen, but it seemed like her face had become paler.\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Lin Jinxuan asked in a low voice, his tone gentle.He had just learned that Qin Ran had fought alone with a dozen boys.Girls naturally had poorer physical fitness than boys.\u201cNo.\u201d Qin Ran was stunned for a while after hearing Lin Jinxuan\u2019s voice. She looked away and shook her head, leaning against the wall with her long eyelashes hanging down.Her mood appeared very bad.It was like a barrel of oil, where a trace of fire could light it up.On one side, Ning Qing and Qin Yu finally reacted.After Lin Jinxuan explained to the police and asked Qin Ran again, his eyes turned to Ning Qing and Qin Yu. He pursed his lips. \u201cAunt, I think you should be more affectionate and trusting towards your own child. It\u2019s not right to only listen to the outsiders\u2019 side of the story, don\u2019t you think?\u201dQin Yu listened to him beside Ning Qing and dug her fingernails into her palm.Who knew that the situation would become like this?The parents didn\u2019t say a word and the police began to re-inquire about the records. With Lin Jinxuan there, they went to check the CCTV as well.It was late now, so Lin Jinxuan helped Qin Ran and Pan Mingyue through the formalities and they were soon both released.The aggressive Grandma Xu was speechless now, and she just stood there constantly looking out the door, deep in her own thoughts.**Deputy Shen received a phone call. He rushed and finally arrived.Xu Shen\u2019s father was at the hospital to see him, so he wasn\u2019t there.\u201cDeputy Shen.\u201d The policeman who was taking down notes stood up to say hello.Grandma Xu\u2019s sluggish spirit was refreshed immediately after seeing Deputy Shen. She took two steps forward and said, \u201cDeputy Shen, you came at the right time. This person injured my grandson and mustn\u2019t be tolerated!\u201d\u201cOld lady, sit down first. I will handle this matter.\u201d Deputy Shen helped her to the side.\u201cI\u2019m assured now that you are here. They were trying to scare me, and I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d Grandma Xu deliberately left out information about Pan Mingyue and only focused on how Qin Ran had injured them.\u201cI just answered Elder Xu\u2019s phone call. Your grandson is disabled, so I will definitely give you an account.\u201d Deputy Shen\u2019s attitude was clear.\u201cDeputy Shen, Xu Shen was the one who attempted violence in this incident.\u201d Lin Jinxuan saw Deputy Shen and said calmly, his brows furrowed.Deputy Shen tilted his head and was slightly shocked to see Lin Jinxuan. \u201cOh, it turns out to be Master Lin. I know about the incident. Young people can fight and the other party can perform self-defense, but now, Xu Shen is the one lying in the hospital.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Seeing the list in the hand of the police, Deputy Shen frowned. \u201cThis matter hasn\u2019t been fully investigated yet, how could you let them go? Wait till Xu Shen wakes up tomorrow and gives a confession statement.\u201d\u201cDeputy Shen, what do you mean?\u201d Lin Jinxuan smiled slightly.\u201cThere are still some pieces of evidence that haven\u2019t arrived yet. We have to do things fairly, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Deputy Shen was showing off his strength now.He acted impartially and reasonably, so not even the slightest mistake could be pointed out.He controlled the situation first before talking about private affairs tomorrow.The people at the police station respected Deputy Shen. Although they were cynical of Grandma Xu\u2019s actions, they were still orderly and listened to his orders.\u201cJinxuan, who is that?\u201d Ning Qing looked at Lin Jinxuan in panic.\u201cThis is Yun Cheng\u2019s Deputy Shen.\u201d Lin Jinxuan frowned. \u201cThe Lin family has no relationship with him. I\u2019ll ask Aunt if she knows anyone from the Public Security Bureau.\u201dThe Lin family was mainly engaged in the catering industry and had never really dealt with the police.Even if Qin Ran had the right intentions, it would be difficult for her to go back tonight if they didn\u2019t receive a release statement.\u201cBring me all those people first.\u201d Deputy Shen wanted to keep an eye on Qin Ran and the other youngsters.\u201cDeputy Shen?\u201d Ning Qing had always been cautious because of her family problems. When she married into the Lin family, she realized just how big the world was.At this moment, when she heard that he was some deputy, she started to panic. She was just a little citizen, and this kind of authority was capable of overturning her.She also didn\u2019t want the Lin family to offend Deputy Shen because of Qin Ran.Furthermore, even Lin Jinxuan felt that it would be difficult to handle matters since the Deputy was involved.\u201cThen let\u2019s go back first\u2026\u201d Ning Qing reached out and anxiously wanted to pull Lin Jinxuan.Lin Jinxuan was worried about Qin Ran being alone in the police station.\u201cI\u2019ll go back and find my dad and aunt first.\u201d Lin Jinxuan looked at Qin Ran, paused, and reassured her. \u201cYou can rest assured\u2026\u201d\u201cKnock knock\u2014\u201dIt was then that someone knocked on the door frame twice.Liked it?

When she heard the sound, she turned her head as well.She saw the young police officer at first glance.\u201cExcuse me, who is Miss Qin Ran?\u201d The police officer glanced through the crowd and finally fixed her eyes on the girl wearing the uniform of First Middle School.The girl had her face turned away, but her beautiful outline could still be seen.Her skin was very white, and she wore her school uniform properly. It was open, and her white shirt inside was stained with a few drops of blood, making thin outlines.With so many people in the crowd, this girl was the most eye-catching, so the police officer\u2019s eyes fell on her face subconsciously.It wasn\u2019t until the girl raised her eyes slightly and looked at her inquiringly that the police officer realized that she was Qin Ran.\u201cMs. Qin, Director Jiang has invited you to the lounge.\u201d The police officer bowed slightly. \u201cPlease follow me.\u201dQin Ran paused, one hand still in her pocket. She tilted her head slightly and narrowed her eyes, wondering who was looking for her.Out of the people she was familiar with\u2026 there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone with the surname Jiang?Lin Jinxuan gave her a questioning look. Qin Ran raised her chin and said quite casually, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll take a look.\u201dShe went out of the door.Jiang Hui had been \u201cexiled\u201d from the capital, and if placed in ancient times, he was suitable for an imperial envoy equivalent to a special envoy.He directly represented the highest oligarchy here.Deputy Shen definitely knew him, but he didn\u2019t know that the \u201cDirector Jiang\u201d the police officer was talking about was the same Jiang Hui that he knew.He watched as Qin Ran followed the police officer and passed by him directly towards the lounge.Deputy Shen was very surprised. He couldn\u2019t help but look at Qin Ran who had already left. He asked the police officer politely, \u201cThis Director Jiang is\u2026\u201dThe police officer glanced at him and, without speaking, turned and left.**In the lounge.Jiang Hui was nearly forty years old. But he was well maintained and looked as if he was in his early thirties.The years left no trace on him.He sat in a chair, reached out and poured two cups of tea. He glanced at the tall and slender figure standing by the door and chuckled. \u201cCome sit here and drink tea. I\u2019ve already sent someone to investigate it. You were so anxious that I thought something had happened.\u201dCheng Juan\u2019s business couldn\u2019t be delayed.Who knew that after rushing here, it turned out to be a dispute between high school students.Cheng Mu sat aside and nodded madly in his heart.It was true, wasn\u2019t it? This matter could have been settled with a phone call, but he just had to bring Jiang Hui here. How many matters had been delayed because of this?In ancient times, their Master Juan was simply an incapable ruler.Lu Zhaoying touched his ear studs and tilted his head. \u201cUncle Jiang, she\u2019s not here yet?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d Jiang Hui was curious at this moment. What kind of little girl could make these two people so anxious?Two figures could be seen outside the window.Jiang Hui picked up the teacup and calmly said, \u201cLook, isn\u2019t she here already?\u201dAfter that, his eyes didn\u2019t shift away.Cheng Juan\u2019s expression was indifferent. His pair of peach blossom eyes were half-squinted and he had his hands around his chest, leaning lazily against the door frame with his slender figure.The familiar figure appeared.Cheng Juan stood straight subconsciously and his eyes fell on her.The little girl followed behind a police officer with her head lowered slightly. She walked over slowly, her uniform loose and making her seem even skinnier and weaker.Her opened jacket revealed her white shirt inside.There were bloodstains.Cheng Juan was very sensitive to the five senses, and before she even came in, he could detect the strong bloody smell.He leaned against the door, looked at her for a few seconds, and then said with a cold expression, \u201cRight hand.\u201dAs soon as Qin Ran looked up, she saw Cheng Juan standing by the door and looking at her.She pursed her lips and glanced at him, then slowly drew out the hand in her pocket.After interacting with so many people, none of them had even noticed a problem with her hand.Lu Zhaoying saw that Qin Ran was here and was slightly relieved, but the next second, he saw Qin Ran\u2019s hand come out of her pocket.The girl\u2019s hands were thin and her nails were clean and moist.Lu Zhaoying had told Cheng Juan more than once that it was the hands of a pianist.The hand was stained with scarlet blood.Some parts were dried while other parts were still dripping.Cheng Juan looked down, lowered his head, and gently opened her fingers with his hands. The two wounds stretched across the palm of her hand. The wound was very narrow and blood was still leaking out.Cheng Juan was a doctor, so how could he not know how deep the wound was?He looked at the hand for a while, his pupils turning dark. \u201cCheng Mu, drive the car over.\u201dThe wound looked really bad. Cheng Mu glanced at it, his wooden face indifferent, but his lips pursed inadvertently.He went to get the car in silence.Lu Zhaoying returned to his senses and stared at the startling wound. He stood up suddenly. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dJiang Hui had been with the two of them for so long, yet in so many years, he had never seen Cheng Juan so angry before. He couldn\u2019t even bear to look him straight.He sat up straight inadvertently and glanced at the director who was sitting on the side, the teacup on the table.A \u201cbeep\u201d sounded.As soon as the director returned home, the police officer gave him a call almost immediately.Director Jiang was coming to inspect their bureau!He didn\u2019t know Cheng Juan and Lu Zhaoying, but he knew Jiang Hui. Seeing how polite Jiang Hui was to Cheng Juan, he dropped his teacup and his heart leaped to his throat.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You guys even carried private punishments?!\u201d He immediately tilted his head and asked the police officer.The police officer handed the confession over to Jiang Hui and repeated the situation.The lounge was very quiet and no one spoke except him. The police officer\u2019s voice gradually became softer.Cheng Mu was still not back with the car. Lu Zhaoying was accustomed to domineering in Beijing, and Qin Ran had been drawn into his circle.\u201cHa\u2014\u201dA chuckle.The police officer felt goosebumps.He looked up cautiously.\u201cWe\u2019ll settle it publicly and privately, tsk.\u201d Lu Zhaoying yanked his collar. His eyes were cold as he walked outside, tilting his head and motioning to a police officer. \u201cWhere are they?\u201dNobody in the whole city dared to say this in front of Master Cheng before!Liked it?

She whispered, \u201cMother, Brother, shall we go back first? Aunt is still waiting for us.\u201dNing Qing was now extremely anxious. She didn\u2019t speak and just looked at Lin Jinxuan.Lin Jinxuan glanced in the direction Qin Ran was taken away. He paused for a long while before looking down at his mobile phone. \u201cFeng Ci just gave me the captain\u2019s phone number. I\u2019ll find aunt first, she should have some connections.\u201dThese things couldn\u2019t be explained in a few simple words, so Lin Jinxuan couldn\u2019t help much by staying here either. He prepared to talk to Lin Wan deeper into the issue.Ning Qing and Qin Yu followed closely behind him.Lin Jinxuan noticed her and pursed his lips. \u201cAunt, aren\u2019t you staying?\u201dQin Ran was still at the police station and the conclusion hadn\u2019t been drawn yet.Impatient and annoyed, she stood where she was and said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for the matter to be settled. Drive carefully.\u201dQin Yu followed Lin Jinxuan into the car.Coincidentally, a black car drove out of the garage with a Volkswagen brand on the outside.It took people\u2019s gaze with it.Qin Yu didn\u2019t seem to care about this car much, but Lin Jinxuan\u2019s footsteps paused when he saw it.\u201cBrother, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Qin Yu glanced at him.Lin Jinxuan stared at the license plate, then shook his head after a while. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Let\u2019s go.\u201dThat was Beijing\u2019s license plate number, but now that Qin Ran\u2019s affair was pressing, Lin Jinxuan didn\u2019t think much about it and hurriedly turned to pick up the car.**Grandma Xu had not realized the tension of the matter.Ever since Deputy Shen came, she had calmed down and had no idea what kind of person she had provoked.She didn\u2019t see that Deputy Shen was drinking tea now, suppressing the uneasiness in his heart.Grandma Xu took the opportunity to talk to Deputy Shen about Qin Ran and the Lin family.\u201cXu Shen might have indeed made a mistake, so it\u2019s not too advantageous to him if we publicize this matter.\u201d Deputy Shen was slightly relieved. He lowered his head and said to Grandma Xu, \u201cI was just testing the little girl just now and scaring them. We will settle it privately. Xu Shen is so severely injured, the compensation fee must be heavy too.\u201dGrandma Xu nodded. The moment Pan Mingyue had spoken, she knew that she couldn\u2019t publicize this.\u201cI\u2019ll pay you as much as you want.\u201d Ning Qing looked at the sharp and pondered openly, \u201cThe children can\u2019t possibly stay at the police station at night\u2026\u201dNing Qing only had one request now. She mustn\u2019t let Qin Ran leave a criminal record behind.She laughed with a stiff face and didn\u2019t dare to say anything.Seeing how scared Ning Qing genuinely was, Grandma Xu and Deputy Shen relaxed a little. The Lin family was also notorious in Yun Cheng, and many people knew that Ning Qing was the second wife.They also knew that Lin Qi\u2019s second wife was from a small family and couldn\u2019t afford to make much trouble. As for Qin Ran, she was just a student and they needn\u2019t worry about her.\u201cIf you want to pay the compensation, follow the rules\u2026\u201d Grandma Xu was mean by nature and always spoke while glaring at others.\u201cI know.\u201d Ning Qing thought about it, picked up her cell phone and went outside to ask her lawyer.After Ning Qing went out, Grandma Xu put down her teacup, wiped her mouth with a paper towel, and smirked. \u201cThe light of fireflies\u2026\u201dBut she didn\u2019t get to finish her sentence.Deputy Shen\u2019s cell phone rang. He took out his phone and looked at it, shocked. \u201cChief?\u201dThe person on the other end said something and caused Deputy Shen to jump up from his chair immediately, the veins on his forehead bulging. \u201cYes, yes.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI understand\u2026\u201dIn just a few words of dialogue, Deputy Shen\u2019s spirit was a bit sluggish.\u201cDeputy Shen, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Grandma Xu held her teacup and took a sip of tea.Deputy Shen rearranged his clothes nervously, his eyes obscure. \u201cIt\u2019s the Chief!\u201dHe had just walked to the door of the office hall and was facing a few people.The Chief was still wearing his home clothes as if he had rushed here in a hurry and hadn\u2019t had time to change his clothes.The police were very familiar with him.But the Chief was obviously one step behind the young man beside him, as if he were following the young man.The police in the hall stood up immediately and called out \u201cChief\u201d.The other people also looked at him. This was the Chief?They couldn\u2019t help but look at the person beside him. Who was this man that made the Chief walk one step behind him?!The young man\u2019s eyebrows were down and his fingertips pinched a freshly lit cigarette. He walked forward and then paused, looking at the house full of people, and then laughed. \u201cThere are a lot of people here, eh?\u201dHe looked around and saw the girl in the corner.The girl had her head down, her short hair tied softly, and she seemed to be holding a cell phone. She seemed to be deep in thought, and a female officer was beside her.\u201cYoung Master Lu?\u201d The Chief said carefully.Lu Zhaoying turned his head, glanced at Grandma Xu\u2019s direction, and then at the squatting teenagers in the room. \u201cYou\u2019re Qin Ran\u2019s classmate, right? Come here, I\u2019ll take you to find her.\u201dSubconsciously, Lu Zhaoying lightened his voice.\u201cChief, settle this privately first, then publicize it.\u201d Lu Zhaoying could settle this small matter with a few simple words. He really used his identity to compete with them and pressurize them. \u201cI\u2019ll take them back first. My lawyer will come soon. I hope I won\u2019t see similar things happening in the future.\u201dThe Chief wiped the cold sweat on his forehead. \u201cI understand, Young Master Lu.\u201dHe sent them to the door.The Chief\u2019s voice was so low and small, so nobody dared to even speak in the originally noisy hall.\u201cHoo\u2014\u201d The people in the hall dared to breathe now.When Lu Zhaoying had left with Pan Mingyue, Grandma Xu responded. \u201cDeputy Shen, what\u2026 what is going on? Who is that person?\u201dDeputy Shen also spoke quietly, \u201cThe Chief.\u201dThe Chief watched as Lu Zhaoying left. This time, he turned sideways and looked at Deputy Shen for a long while, before finally shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s best if this matter is settled privately. If you are lucky, this matter can be resolved peacefully.\u201d\u201cThen what about the compensation\u2026\u201d Grandma Xu had planned it to be settled privately, so she didn\u2019t care too much about it.\u201cYou still want them to compensate for the loss? If your family can make them settle it privately, it\u2019s already considered a once in a lifetime struck of luck. They want to publicize it eventually! Deputy Shen, are you muddle-headed?

If she wanted to settle it privately, she would have to compensate an estimated 800,000 yuan.This was a small sum of money for the Lin family, but Lin Qi had the details of Ning Qing\u2019s card records.Ning Qing walked inside the police station while pressing her temple.\u201cMrs. Ning.\u201d The policewoman came forward politely.Her attitude was so good it was a little strange. Ning Qing looked up. \u201cMy daughter\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, the Chief is dealing with the matter now.\u201d The policewoman took her pen and lowered her head to write down her notes. \u201cYour daughter has already left the police station. As for Xu Shen, we have already sent people to transfer the Ninghai Town\u2019s files, and we will also bring people there to question him.\u201dWhen the section chief politely sent her out, Ning Qing had not fully figured out what was going on.The Chief was dealing with the matter?What did this have to do with the Chief?She didn\u2019t even know who the Chief was.**The school\u2019s medical office had incomplete tools, so Cheng Mu drove the car directly to the hospital.Cheng Juan had a temporary sterilization box in his car but didn\u2019t have other tools, so he could only help her disinfect it and handled it slightly.The lights in the back seat were on.It was either because Cheng Mu\u2019s driving was stable or because the car was performing well, but the journey was smooth and without any bumps.Cheng Juan lowered his eyes and wrapped the bandages thinly. He swept disinfected water across her two wounds gently.Because Qin Ran\u2019s skin was too white, the contrast of bright red was even more obvious.His heart ached and tightened at the sight.He paused, cleared his throat, and looked up. \u201cYou\u2026\u201dHe saw Qin Ran holding the window in her left hand, leaning lazily on the backrest with her head tilted. She was looking out the window, and the light shone a shadow under her dark eyes.Her eyes were narrowed slightly, and when he looked closely, it seemed absentminded and slightly cynical.Qin Ran didn\u2019t move her hand. She slightly tilted her head and opened her mouth slowly. \u201cWhat?\u201dHer eyes were clear and her expression was plain as if she didn\u2019t have two wounds on her hand.The phrase \u201cIf it hurts, tell me\u201d was swallowed back into his throat. Cheng Juan stared into her eyes and couldn\u2019t look away from those eyes filled with a sea of stars.They arrived at the hospital soon. In the evening, the doctor was ready to help her with stitches.Cheng Juan held a cell phone against the wall and talked with Lu Zhaoying.\u201cIt\u2019s good to be eighteen,\u201d Cheng Juan said, his eyes falling heavily on the door. He had a lit cigarette between his fingertips and his expression was still lazy, but his words were cool. \u201cAll the responsibilities can be taken.\u201dThe stitches on Qin Ran\u2019s hand were sewn, and the anesthesia time was estimated to be over soon.Cheng Juan kept the phone and subconsciously wanted to get rid of the cigarette.\u201cDon\u2019t avoid me.\u201d Qin Ran thought for a moment, then tilted her head and leaned against the wall. She looked into his eyes and smiled. \u201cGive me one?\u201dHer voice was light.Cheng Juan stumped his cigarette without changing his expression and threw it into the trash.He also threw away the cigarettes in his pocket.Qin Ran didn\u2019t mind. She just shrugged and said, \u201cThank you for today. You can deduct the expenses from my pay.\u201dCheng Juan looked at her back as she walked in front of him, pressed his temple with his fingers and stood there for a long while.**Over here.Ning Qing returned to the Lin family\u2019s house.Lin Qi was sitting in the lobby.Lin Jinxuan hung up his phone call and saw that she was back. \u201cAunt, why are you back? How is Qin Ran?\u201dQin Yu heard the voices and put down her violin. \u201cAunt, Mother seems to be back. Shall we go down and take a look?\u201dShe led Lin Wan downstairs.Ning Qing was still thinking about the Chief. She had called Qin Ran but she didn\u2019t pick up. Now that she saw Lin Wan, she didn\u2019t know how to speak all of a sudden.She pursed her lips and didn\u2019t speak.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, making the whole family so restless. Jinxuan and my brother have been looking for people the whole night.\u201d Lin Wan took a sip of tea and glanced at Ning Qing.\u201cThis matter isn\u2019t so simple.\u201d Lin Jinxuan shook his head. \u201cDeputy Shen intervened. Aunt, is there anyone you know in the Public Security Bureau?\u201dLin Wan put the teacup on the table and said nothing.\u201cAunt, please help my sister. She\u2019s still detained at the police station.\u201d Qin Yu shook Lin Wan\u2019s arm.\u201cDetained at the police station?\u201d Lin Wan glanced at Ning Qing until Ning Qing was too embarrassed and looked back. \u201cYou are ridiculous. I do know a few people. I can find them tomorrow.\u201dNing Qing was relieved. The Ning family really couldn\u2019t find a few acquaintances, so it was good that Lin Wan offered to help.\u201cJinxuan, do you know their Chief?\u201d Ning Qing asked Lin Jinxuan.\u201cHa\u2014\u201d Lin Wan laughed. \u201cBrother, Jinxuan, I\u2019ll go to bed first.\u201dNing Qing sat on the sofa, on her pins and needles.Lin Jinxuan explained, \u201cOur Lin family is only a merchant.\u201dAfter all, the Lin family had a very weak foundation.That was why it was strange.Ning Qing smiled awkwardly. She didn\u2019t know much about such things, but\u2026She frowned\u2026 what had that policewoman meant?Could it be that Qin Ran or Pan Mingyue knew him?**The next day.Early in the morning.The sound of classroom exercises in the dormitory building kept sounding.Qin Ran had already asked for leave, but the noise was still unbearable.She got out of bed irritably.Her eyes were bloodshot.Yesterday, Lu Zhaoying had taken the school uniform coat to the dry cleaners and she had taken a thin black jacket on the way.At this moment, it was time for official exercises, but First Middle School rarely had drills, and the lesson period was long, so the students all went out to buy snacks.People came and went.Qin Ran had her head lowered slightly and was dressed neatly in her school uniform. She half-squinted her apricot eyes and frowned slightly.In the past two days, Qiao Sheng hadn\u2019t paid much attention to Qin Yu. Qin Yu had felt it, but she pretended that it was nothing.He went downstairs with Xu Yaoguang to buy lollipops, and Qin Yu went with them to discuss a few questions with Xu Yaoguang in a low voice. Most of the people\u2019s eyes were on them along the way.Qiao Sheng put one hand in his pocket, and there were a few younger brothers following him.\u201cQin Ran took leave today?\u201d He peeled a lollipop and stuffed it into his mouth, and then tilted his head and asked Xu Yaoguang.Xu Yaoguang was today\u2019s discipline leader.Xu Yaoguang was cold. He paused, then shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dQin Yu stood aside and froze. \u201cDon\u2019t you guys know?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAbout my sister\u2026\u201d Qin Yu pursed her lips, then shook her head and played with her fingers. \u201cShe committed a crime, so she\u2019s still in the police station.\u201dLiked it?

Several people around Qiao Sheng heard it and looked at each other. The people passing by also went over to listen.\u201cWhat happened? Qin Yu, how do you know?\u201d\u201cOh my God, she got locked up!\u201d\u201cWhat crime did she commit for her to be locked up?\u201dQin Yu was a popular figure in the school. Especially during this period, Qiao Sheng and others were covered by her limelight. Everyone surrounded her.Being locked in a police station was not a trivial matter.According to the development of this situation, it would take less than an afternoon for the news to be passed throughout the school.Qin Yu walked on the right side of Qiao Sheng, closest to the side of the road, and Qiao Sheng had stopped moving the lollipop around in his mouth. He pushed it to the side, looked at Qin Yu, and frowned. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a criminal case,\u201d said Qin Yu ambiguously. She felt the eyes of the people around her and whispered, \u201cI think she won\u2019t be able to come out for a while. Sigh, stop asking me, I don\u2019t want to talk about it\u2026\u201dBefore she could finish talking, an empty water bottle suddenly hit her.\u201cBang\u2014\u201d There was a loud noise, and it slammed into the tree a few steps away and bounced to her feet again.People who were still gossiping looked in the direction the water bottle came from.Qin Ran was standing a dozen meters away, with one hand in her pocket. Ignoring everyone, she looked straight ahead and walked forward.Her eyes were narrowed slightly and her eyebrows furrowed. She had on her familiar nonchalant and cold look.She frowned. It seemed like the school atmosphere was a bit heavy today and it was also so crowded. However, everyone stayed a meter away from her and no one dared to approach her.Qiao Sheng looked at her and froze. \u201cQin Ran?\u201dQin Ran answered with a nasal sound and then looked up. \u201cWhat?\u201dShe still had on her familiar expression. She wore a long coat that hung down naturally, covering most of the right hand, where only a little gauze was exposed.\u201cNothing.\u201d Qiao Sheng glanced at Qin Yu sideways, bit his lollipop, and finally smiled. \u201cI heard that you were locked up in the police station and was just preparing to go bail you out.\u201dHe put his hands in his pockets, leaned over slightly, and told Xu Yaoguang not to go to the store.\u201cWhy are you out?\u201d Qin Yu looked at Qin Ran in disbelief.Due to Qin Ran\u2019s affairs, Ning Qing and the others had discussed for a long time yesterday. They had yet to find a solution and could only wait for someone to give it a try today.According to the aggressive attitude of the Xu family last night, it had been estimated that Qin Ran would have to be locked up for at least two to three days.Who knew that within one night, she was already back in school?Qin Ran put her hand in her pocket and turned away.Qiao Sheng waved to Xu Yaoguang and immediately followed her.\u201cDidn\u2019t she say that Qin Ran\u2019s crime got her locked up, and she still had to stay there for a few more days?\u201d\u201cYeah, how can someone locked up be here.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dAfter Qin Ran and Qiao Sheng had left, everyone looked at Qin Yu and discussed fervently.Their tones were strange and doubtful. Qin Yu had been in school for such a long time, and this was the first time she was being doubted. She opened her mouth and smiled reluctantly.There was some panic in her heart.As soon as she looked up, she saw Xu Yaoguang looking at her solemnly. In his cold eyes, the light had faded.Qin Yu subconsciously pinned the hair that had fallen over her face behind her ears and pursed her lips.**Feng family.Lin Wan had come with Lin Jinxuan.Mrs. Feng was very welcoming and even asked about Qin Yu.Upstairs, Feng Loucheng came down with his mobile phone.Lin Wan, who had been sitting on the couch, stood up immediately with Lin Jinxuan.Recently, everyone who knew anything knew that Feng Loucheng was about to be promoted. However, there was no specific news as to what position.Water to a fish was as Mrs. Feng to Lin Wan.But in the face of Feng Loucheng, she was somewhat restrained. If it was not because Lin Jinxuan was familiar with Feng Ci, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to see Feng Loucheng.\u201cMayor Feng.\u201d Lin Wan stood up. Feng Loucheng\u2019s eyes were almost inconceivable, and even she was very restrained.Lin Jinxuan also greeted him.Feng Loucheng glanced at the two of them with the same expression on his face. He let Mrs. Feng and Feng Ci entertain the two and smiled. \u201cI have a business matter to attend to, so I will take my leave.\u201d\u201cYes, please attend to your business,\u201d Lin Wan said quickly.Of course, the mayor of a city was busy. How would she dare let Feng Loucheng entertain them?It was already unexpected for Lin Wan to see him today.Usually, they could only see him on the TV news or in reports.However, this Feng Loucheng was truly not very sociable.Feng Loucheng nodded, held his cell phone to his ear, and strode out.Far away, Lin Wan and Lin Jinxuan faintly heard the word \u201cMs. Qin\u201d.Lin Wan paused, thinking about which big surname in Yun Cheng had the word \u201cQin\u201d. After thinking for a long time, she still had no clue, so she regained her senses and talked to Mrs. Feng.They didn\u2019t stay long before going out.**Feng Loucheng didn\u2019t go to his office.Instead, he parked his car in front of a private kitchen.Although his license plate number was assigned and was very special, because of his low-key behavior on a normal basis, few people in Yun Cheng knew his license plate.After waiting for about twenty minutes, a taxi stopped at the door, and a girl in a plaid thin shirt came down from the back door.The other person\u2019s earphones were plugged into her ears. She was looking down, absentminded and indifferent.On the other hand, Feng Loucheng looked solemn and opened the car door to walk over.\u201cMs. Qin.\u201d He spoke first, with a steady and serious tone. Upon closer inspection, it was even a little respectful.As if he didn\u2019t seem to think there was anything wrong with calling a girl who was more than 20 years younger than him \u201cMs. Qin\u201d.\u201cUncle Feng.\u201d Qin Ran took off her earphones and squinted her eyes. She saw Feng Loucheng clearly and nodded slightly. \u201cJust call me by my name.\u201dFeng Loucheng smiled but did not answer.Qin Ran was obviously used to it. She said nothing and turned to walk in first. \u201cLet\u2019s go inside to talk.\u201dFeng Loucheng walked half a step behind her and helped her open the door.Not far from the opposite side, there was a very sharp braking sound.The black BMW stopped.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lin Wan, who was sitting in the passenger seat, had been putting on lipstick when the car stopped. Her lipstick almost bumped against her nose.Lin Jinxuan shook his head and looked at the opposite side. \u201cAunt, isn\u2019t that person Qin Ran?\u201dLiked it?

Isn\u2019t this the Mayor?Feng Loucheng had climbed to this position before he was even fifty years old. He was humble but had a sort of domineering spirit in his bones.But at this time, that sharp spirit had all converged.Lin Wan couldn\u2019t help wondering who was the one who could make Yun Cheng\u2019s mayor walk a half step behind and give this respectful attitude?\u201cYou said she was Qin Ran?\u201d Lin Wan hesitated, turning her eyes to the girl in the plaid shirt who had already entered the door.The girl only showed her back and wasn\u2019t wearing a school uniform. Half of her body was covered by Feng Loucheng. Lin Wan had only seen Qin Ran once, so she couldn\u2019t recognize her.She put away her lipstick, smiled, and thoughtfully looked back. \u201cHow could it be her? You must have seen it wrongly. She only came out of the police station last night, how could she possibly see the mayor now?\u201dThe person who could make Feng Loucheng walk a step behind and open the door for her was Qin Ran?Even throughout the whole of Yun Cheng, Lin Wan couldn\u2019t even think of anyone who could make Feng Loucheng be so respectful.**In the room, Qin Ran pulled a chair to the window and sat down.Feng Loucheng poured two cups of tea and pushed one to Qin Ran.Qin Ran pushed open the window. There was an artificial lake downstairs. She leaned back against the chair, held the teacup in her left hand but did not drink it, just turned it around in her hands.Feng Loucheng saw that her right hand was wrapped in gauze and frowned, his voice tense. \u201cYour hand?\u201d\u201cWhy are you so nervous, I can\u2019t die from this.\u201d Qin Ran leaned lazily against the back of her chair, raising her brows slightly.\u201cNonsense!\u201d Feng Loucheng rarely raised his elder attitude. \u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s alright, do you know how much your hands\u2026\u201dHearing this, Qin Ran leaned on her chin, tilted her head, and glanced at him.Feng Loucheng paused and stared at Qin Ran.He changed the topic, but his face was still black. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to the hospital to do a check-up.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really okay,\u201d Qin Ran said, looking at the palm of her right hand and smiling indifferently. \u201cI came to you to talk about Mingyue.\u201d\u201cMingyue?\u201d Feng Loucheng glanced at her hand and forced himself to look away.\u201cHave you met? She must have been happy to see you.\u201dQin Ran nodded and said, \u201cWe met Xu Shen yesterday.\u201d\u201cHim?!\u201d Feng Loucheng\u2019s face sank, and the teacup landed on the table with a slam.Qin Ran summarized the incident to him.\u201cThat scum!\u201d Feng Loucheng grimaced. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about this, I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d The dishes were almost here, all of which Qin Ran liked to eat. She propped her legs up and ate with her chopsticks.Although Feng Loucheng was thinking about Pan Mingyue, his eyes were still staring at her.He immediately asked the server to clear the dishes. \u201cYour hand is injured, why are you eating spicy food?\u201dQin Ran faced a healthy bowl of soup: \u201c\u2026\u201dFeng Loucheng ordered a few more bowls of light healthy dishes.In front of Qin Ran\u2019s very apathetic face, he bowed his head and muttered quietly, \u201cIf\u2026 if they know that you were so badly injured on my site, my skin will be cut off.\u201dQin Ran poked at the stir-fried cabbage with a few grains of wolfberry expressionlessly.There was no fluctuation in her heart and she even wanted to laugh.**Xu Shen, at this time, did not know that his impulsiveness had reined in two wise and powerful men.Father Xu was in the hospital all night. Xu Shen was injured in many places, and both of his arms were broken. Even if he recovered, it would still have an impact on him.He didn\u2019t know who had beaten his son, but he didn\u2019t plan on letting the other party go for injuring his son this severely.It wasn\u2019t until Deputy Shen talked to him on the phone that he knew the other party was Qin Ran.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that it was Qin Ran yesterday?\u201d Father Xu hung up the phone, his heart beating in anger.Grandma Xu didn\u2019t expect his reaction to be so big. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the student you taught before? I know you like her, but she hit\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you before that Xu Shen deserved it. You\u2026\u201d Father Xu inhaled sharply.He couldn\u2019t help but light a cigarette and looked at the police officer who was looking for Xu Shen\u2019s confession, frowning.He didn\u2019t dare to find Qin Ran, nor did he have the face to.Although there was a relationship between master and apprentice, Qin Ran might not even acknowledge him if he went.After thinking about it for a while, Father Xu went out and made several phone calls.**After seeing Feng Loucheng, Qin Ran returned to class.When she got back, the class had just ended.Mu Ying stood at the entrance of the classroom and waited for her.\u201cCousin, are you back?\u201d Seeing Qin Ran, Mu Ying twisted her fingers, looked down at her hand, and asked carefully, \u201cIs your hand okay?\u201dThis morning, the whole school, and even the forum, had been discussing Qin Ran\u2019s injured hand.Some people even went to the store to buy a lot of chocolates and other snacks to see her.In the classroom, Qiao Sheng, who had been leaning on the table and chatting away, saw Qin Ran and immediately stood up. He called her.\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Qin Ran squinted. \u201cDon\u2019t tell aunt about it. You can go back first.\u201dMu Ying said \u201cOh\u201d, but didn\u2019t leave immediately. She stood at the window and couldn\u2019t help but look into the class. The handsome and sunny boy was walking to Qin Ran\u2019s table, his eyes gentle, the complete opposite of his overbearing and arrogant description.She couldn\u2019t help thinking of how Li Yuhan had described Qiao Sheng. A veritable rich second generation with several mines in his family.\u201cCousin.\u201d Many people come in and out of Class 3.9 from time to time.They all smiled and greeted Mu Ying.They copied Qin Ran and called her Mu Ying cousin.Mu Ying blushed and responded.She glanced through the window again before leaving.In the class, Lin Siran poured water into Qin Ran\u2019s thermos lid.\u201cThe next class is biology class.\u201d Seeing how Qin Ran finished the water, she screwed the lid and walked over to help her find her books.Qin Ran had many books.She had several notes and materials, plus original extracurricular books and textbooks. There was not only a large stack on the table but also several placed on the windowsill.Lin Siran finally found her biology textbook from a pile of books and pulled it out.A piece of paper floated down.Qin Ran was stunned.Lin Siran immediately stooped to pick up the paper. \u201cRan Ran, do you want this paper\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you talking?\u201d Qiao Sheng looked over. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s a love letter\u2026\u201dBefore he finished talking, he was also stunned.The paper was full of words, the stance unrestrained and incredibly reckless. The vigor of the handwriting was full of willfulness.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She had to take care of her injured right hand, so her movements were a little awkward.She raised her eyebrows when she saw the paper.\u201cThis handwriting looks really good.\u201d Lin Siran reacted first. She picked up the paper and patted it on the table, looked at the content and was particularly excited. \u201cQin Ran, you\u2019re also Yan Xi\u2019s fan?\u201dThe lyrics of a song just released by Yan Xi was on the paper. As a fan, Lin Siran naturally recognized it.Qin Ran tilted her head and said in an unwavering tone, \u201cI\u2019m really not.\u201d\u201cThen why do you have the lyrics to Yan Xi\u2019s song?\u201d Lin Siran held up the paper in her hands.Qiao Sheng couldn\u2019t tell that it was lyrics. He just reached out and pulled it away. \u201cThis is definitely not copied down by her. How could she write so well? Oh yeah, who gave it to you?\u201dQiao Sheng was really a little genius!Suddenly, Qin Ran calmed down. She played with her mobile phone in her left hand, tilted her body, and laughed. \u201cOh, my neighbor wrote it. Is his handwriting nice?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lin Siran nodded frantically, and then glanced down again. \u201cYour neighbor could probably write posts with this standard?\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you practice to write so well?\u201d Qiao Sheng snorted.Qin Ran looked down at her mobile phone and ignored him.As class approached, Qiao Sheng returned to his seat.**Qin Ran\u2019s hand still needed to be bandaged again. Cheng Mu had taken all the medicine to the school medical office yesterday.Two people in the school doctor\u2019s office could help her change her bandage.When Qin Ran arrived at the school medical office, Lu Zhaoying was standing outside the door and calling someone. His tone seemed serious, and he waved at her when she passed.Cheng Juan was in the school medical office. He was still leaning lazily against the sofa, with his computer on his legs. His expression was lazy, but his clear brows seemed to have a sense of frustration.\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d Cheng Juan set the computer aside and took out the medicine chest.He signaled for Qin Ran to sit down and then sat next to her.He opened the bandage carefully to reveal the wound inside. He made a few stitches and the wound looked bad.It was easy for the palm to sweat in summer, so it was inevitable that water would touch the wound and mess with the medicine.Cheng Juan took a cotton swab, pinched her finger, and carefully cleaned it up with medical alcohol, careful not to touch the wound. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Qin Ran said lazily with her left hand supporting her chin. \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious.\u201dCheng Juan gave a low \u201cum\u201d and didn\u2019t say a word, but his movements lightened a lot.His eyebrows were down, his long eyelashes covered, and his outline looked hazy.After changing the medicine, he saw Qin Ran getting up and leaving. Cheng Juan asked her where she was going.\u201cThe canteen. Lin Siran is still waiting for me to eat.\u201d Qin Ran looked at her right hand and felt like it wasn\u2019t as painful as it had been yesterday.She was injured and naturally couldn\u2019t work.In the morning after class, she had already pushed aside her part-time job at the bubble tea shop.She still wanted to squeeze with others at the canteen?Wasn\u2019t she afraid of the wound opening up again?The corners of Cheng Juan\u2019s lips curled up.Qin Ran didn\u2019t notice and just waved her left hand. \u201cI\u2019ll get going first then.\u201dWhen she walked out of the door, she met Lu Zhaoying, who had just returned from the phone call and even said hello.Lu Zhaoying threw the phone on the table and scratched his head. \u201cWhere is she going? Why not let her stay for dinner?\u201dCheng Juan turned and sat back down on the sofa.His lips were pursed and he looked cold.Lu Zhaoying couldn\u2019t understand his attitude but didn\u2019t dare to ask.He only changed the topic. \u201cThat Deputy Shen went to Uncle Jiang.\u201dCheng Juan drew a cigarette and bit it, smirking. \u201cWhat a coward, wasn\u2019t he very prestigious?\u201dThe bottom of his eyes was cold and there was no hint of a smile.Cheng Mu, who just came in: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe other party could be squeezed to death with one finger. How could Deputy Shen possibly not cower?**The Lin family.When Father Xu found the place, Lin Qi and Lin Jinxuan were both not at home.Ning Qing sat in the gazebo in the yard to entertain him.There was no follow-up news from the Public Security Bureau. Ning Qing had gathered a few pieces, sold some jewelry, and put up half a million in a card.Today Lin Jinxuan brought back news that Xu Shen had broken both hands.The consequences were severe.Ning Qing worked really hard to settle the follow-up and ensure that Qin Ran wouldn\u2019t have to be sued and jailed.Last night she practically didn\u2019t sleep and had to use a lot of foundation to cover up her dark eye circles.She didn\u2019t expect that Father Xu would come.\u201cMrs. Lin.\u201d Father Xu knew Ning Qing.Ning Qing held the bank card in her hand and didn\u2019t want anyone in the Lin family to see her ugly state. \u201cAunt Zhang, go down first. I will talk to Mr. Xu.\u201dZhang Yan glanced at her and hesitated, but returned after serving a pot of tea.\u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d Inside the room, Lin Wan put her shawl in her hands and came downstairs.Aunt Zhang pursed her lips, poured another cup of tea for Lin Wan, and lowered her voice. \u201cWho else could it be? It\u2019s Mr. Xu, and I saw Madam holding a bank card.\u201dLin Wan sat on the sofa, heard the words, and smiled.She didn\u2019t say more.Outside.Father Xu was sitting on a stool, restless and not knowing what to say.\u201cMr. Xu, I\u2019m so sorry, my child\u2026 Sigh.\u201d He was expressionless, so Ning Qing misunderstood his intentions. She poured him a cup of tea and spoke first, putting her pride down.She didn\u2019t dare go out since last night.She was afraid to meet the eyes of the servants, especially that of the Lin family.Ning Qing took a sip of tea. \u201cYou also know how Qin Ran is. She was never obedient since young. She clearly learned the violin before Yu\u2019er, but who would guess that Yu\u2019er is almost in ninth grade, and yet her violin is still so average. And she even hit your son. I\u2019m so ashamed to even talk about this.\u201dFather Xu had come with a trembling heart and had kept drinking water to ease his nerves.He didn\u2019t expect Ning Qing to say this.He held the teacup in his hand and was a little confused. \u201cWait, Mrs. Lin.\u201dNing Qing held the bank card in her hand and looked up at him.Father Xu looked at her. \u201cNo, who said that Qin Ran didn\u2019t learn the violin well?

She saw Ning Qing sitting with Father Xu in the gazebo on the left, turned, and said quietly, \u201cMom, your friend is here?\u201dQin Yu had not seen Father Xu before. She looked him up and down and couldn\u2019t remember who he was.He probably wasn\u2019t close to the Lin family.Otherwise, Lin Wan would have come out to entertain him.Qin Yu quietly looked at the bank card in Ning Qing\u2019s hand and guessed very smartly. \u201cIs this\u2026 Xu Shen\u2019s father?\u201dInside the room, Lin Wan drank half a cup of tea, gathered her shawl, and walked out slowly, her movements graceful.The other servants didn\u2019t dare to look up, but they moved lightly and listened with pointed ears.Ning Qing could feel the servants occasionally glance over with strange expressions.From yesterday to today, news of the Lin family members running around for Qin Ran, who had been detained by the police due to a fight, had already spread throughout the whole Lin family.It had taken her twelve years to create the image of a magnificent lady of her own. In just one month, she seemed to have become a joke.\u201cMr. Xu, it\u2019s not good for anyone if this matter is publicized. If it\u2019s possible, it\u2019s best to settle it privately. It\u2019ll be good for our families\u2019 reputation too,\u201d Lin Wan said.Lin Wan had no intention of bothering about Ning Qing\u2019s daughter, nor did she want to spend time on such things.She didn\u2019t know why Lin Qi and Lin Jinxuan had to protect this stepdaughter Qin Ran, who could bring nothing to the table except for her pretty face. However, since Lin Jinxuan had already come to her for help, she couldn\u2019t just stand by and watch.\u201cUncle Xu, my sister finally had the opportunity to come to First Middle School. She has been delayed for a year already and can\u2019t take a break anymore.\u201d Qin Yu took her schoolbag back to the servant.She didn\u2019t like Qin Ran, but she hated the idea of an elder sister behind bars even more.\u201cI want to settle it privately too.\u201d Father Xu quickly took out his check and embarrassedly said, \u201cThis is my son\u2019s fault. On account of me having taught Ran Ran before, tell her to request for the Chief to stop pressurizing my son. She definitely wouldn\u2019t want to see me, so Mrs. Lin, could you help me hand this cheque to her?\u201dSpeaking of this, he bowed his head in shame. \u201cThis is a one-million-dollar compensation. I heard that Ran Ran\u2019s hand was also injured. Her hand\u2026\u201dNothing could happen to her hand.Hearing this, the room was silent, and even Ning Qing had yet to respond.Qin Yu looked at Father Xu in shock.How could there be such a big reversal all of a sudden?Father Xu gave the check to Ning Qing and turned to leave.Lin Wan squinted at Father Xu\u2019s back for a long time and then at Ning Qing, who was still rooted in place. Her voice was particularly clear as she asked, \u201cYour daughter knows the Chief?\u201dNing Qing was also shocked.Her realization came later. So Qin Ran wasn\u2019t at fault in this matter?From the moment she had known about this matter, she had accused her subconsciously. She hadn\u2019t listened to her explanation and hadn\u2019t even known that her hand was injured.Looking down at the one-million cheque in her hand, Ning Qing\u2019s heart trembled. Even Father Xu knew that she had a hand injury, but she, as her mother, hadn\u2019t known about it until just now\u2026Qin Yu looked at the scene, digging her fingernails into the palm of her hand. She said, \u201cAunt, I reorganized a tune last night. Do you want to listen to it and see if Teacher Wei will like it?\u201dLin Wan had stayed in the Lin family for so long to watch Qin Yu practice the violin.It was her top priority.**Late self-study.Qin Ran leaned against the wall and threw a notebook onto Lin Siran\u2019s table. She had a lollipop in her mouth and was absentminded.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Lin Siran flipped through the notebook. It was a physics review note, and she opened her mouth softly.She opened it and took a look at the three cursive words written on the title page.She only recognized one \u201csong\u201d and one \u201claw\u201d.Qin Ran\u2019s eyelids were squinting. Perhaps it was because of her hand, but she was a little wan and her voice was hoarse. \u201cSomeone gave me that, you can take a look.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Lin Siran nodded.She turned a few pages and accepted Qin Ran\u2019s kindness, but didn\u2019t pay much attention to it.She just set it aside.Qin Ran put her mobile phone on the table and flipped through the book in her hand while deep in thought. Her eyebrows looked frustrated and she bit the lollipop in her mouth into pieces.Lin Siran helped her unscrew the lid of her bottle and poured water into it.\u201cRan Ran, your phone is ringing.\u201d She pointed to Qin Ran\u2019s mobile phone that was vibrating constantly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Qin Ran didn\u2019t even look up. She squinted her eyes and her voice was lazy.The caller was Ning Qing, and she was too lazy to answer.After self-study.Qin Ran didn\u2019t return to the dormitory with Lin Siran. She cleared her throat and tilted her head slightly. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy something.\u201d\u201cNeed my help?\u201d Lin Siran looked at her hand.\u201cNo.\u201d Qin Ran walked towards the door of the school, waving back to Lin Siran and smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll come back immediately.\u201dThere were many students living in school who had self-study, and students also came back to school to study as well, but there were only a few.It was deserted and dark outside the school.Qin Yu had originally been practicing the violin at home, but she kept thinking about Qin Ran\u2019s affairs and couldn\u2019t calm down. She wasn\u2019t playing the violin well and was afraid Lin Wan would hear it, so she made an excuse to come to school.She always felt that Qin Ran was out of her control.\u201cMiss.\u201d The driver of the Lin family opened the door and let Qin Yu get on.Qin Yu nodded and was just about to get in the car when she saw a familiar figure out of the corner of her eye.She gestured slightly to the driver to wait for her and walked to an alley in the school\u2019s residential area.There were no lights in the alley.Only the faint yellow street lights at the intersection.Qin Ran hid at the intersection, looking around carefully. She saw a black car at the end of the alley, a Mercedes.Qin Ran stood by the door.Beside her, there was a man. Because he was facing away from Qin Yu, she couldn\u2019t see his face, but she vaguely saw that he wasn\u2019t young. The figure had a vaguely familiar side face\u2014Qin Yu was startled.\u2014From 15 Feb 2020, Coins spent on books that aren\u2019t selected will be refunded within 30 days.

Her whole figure was hidden in the shadow from the wall and she tilted her head sideways, having a slight headache. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for such trouble.\u201d\u201cI inquired about it, you\u2019ll make up for whatever you eat.\u201d Feng Loucheng put an insulation container in her left hand and persuaded her carefully. \u201cNourish your skin.\u201d\u201cOkay, just this time,\u201d Qin Ran had a headache and said sincerely.Feng Loucheng just looked at her like an old father and didn\u2019t promise nor refuse.Qin Ran returned to the bedroom with the container.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Lin Siran helped her open it and took a bowl.Wu Yan was taking a bath in the bathroom. Qin Ran sat down on a stool, her eyes down, her feet laying lazily on the table. She leaned back and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dLin Siran unscrewed the lid and looked inside: \u201c\u2026\u201dPig\u2019s foot soup, wolfberry, and a hint of Chinese medicine.Lin Siran was sitting in another chair, lying on the table watching her drink soup. \u201cRan Ran.\u201dQin Ran turned her head to the side and squinted her eyes slightly. She was slightly relaxed and her voice was quite low. \u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cAs for our self-study and discussion on the class speech contest in the evening, our only senior high school event, would you join me?\u201d Lin Siran blinked with her hand on her chin.\u201cI have to add on to the number of people?\u201d Qin Ran glanced at her with an eyebrow raised.\u201cNo, you know, you are now the face of our class!\u201d Lin Siran\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cYou just have to stand in front and read the speech we wrote. I\u2019m certain we\u2019ll score five points higher than the other classes.\u201dAs the campus belle, Qin Ran was indeed class 3.9\u2019s face.It turned out she was selling her face. After drinking the soup, Qin Ran thought for a moment and nodded, easygoing. \u201cSure.\u201d**The next day, the Lin family welcomed another guest.\u201cDeputy Shen?\u201d Lin Qi thought for a moment. The Lin family had no relationship with the political world. There were so many intricacies there, and the politicians cherished their plumage and didn\u2019t interact easily.Only Lin Jinxuan knew Feng Ci, but even so, he wasn\u2019t close to him.As Deputy Shen approached, Lin Qi and Lin Wan were very cautious.Lin Qi personally poured tea to Deputy Shen.\u201cDeputy, you\u2019re looking for me because of my stepdaughter?\u201d Lin Qi and Deputy Shen didn\u2019t have any relationship, so he knew the motive behind his arrival immediately.Deputy Shen held the water, his expression very bad, his tone sincere. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any choice, so I could only come and find you. What happened that night was all a misunderstanding. As long as Ms. Qin agrees to privatize the matter, I will owe her a favor.\u201dLin Qi had also been running around for Qin Ran\u2019s affairs yesterday, but who knew that things would have changed so much in one day.He looked at Lin Wan and knew that things weren\u2019t simple.Lin Qi was expressionless. He put down his teacup and laughed. \u201cRan Ran doesn\u2019t stay here. This matter\u2026\u201d\u201cTo be honest, the Chief is paying attention to this matter.\u201d Deputy Shen smiled bitterly. \u201cThere were indeed internal affairs after investigating deeper into Ms. Qin\u2019s case. As long as you\u2019re willing to help me, you can come and find me if the Lin family needs help in the future.\u201dAs a businessman, this business really did work.Deputy Shen\u2019s favor wasn\u2019t so easy to come across.But Lin Qi didn\u2019t agree and was ambiguous. \u201cThis matter depends on Ran Ran.\u201dWhen Deputy Shen was gone, Lin Wan pressed her eyebrows. \u201cBrother, why didn\u2019t you agree?\u201d\u201cWe can relay the message for him.\u201d Lin Qi shook his head, his expression calm. He said slowly, \u201cBut we can\u2019t agree in Ran Ran\u2019s place.\u201dNing Qing looked at the two of them, holding the phone thoughtfully.**Not far from First Middle School\u2019s door.The black car drove carelessly.Lu Zhaoying was drowsy in the passenger seat. \u201cMaster Juan, that Xu Shen was brought to the detention center. I asked for Qin Ran and Pan Mingyue\u2019s file in Ninghai Town, but I couldn\u2019t find everything.\u201dLu Zhaoying thought it was strange.Normally, as long as the Chief asked for it, such files were easily transferred over.He glanced over at Cheng Juan, who still hadn\u2019t moved, and raised his eyebrows. Cheng Juan had been the most active one before.Cheng Juan was sitting behind, leaning halfway on the window. His head tilted slightly and looked outside lazily, quiet and attentive.Lu Zhaoying felt he was weird and glanced over.He suddenly smiled.\u201cAh\u2014 isn\u2019t that Qin Ran? Why is she coming out?\u201dCheng Mu, who was driving, glanced at Cheng Juan\u2019s dark eyes in the rearview mirror and stepped on the brake subconsciously.Master Juan indeed got out of the car.Cheng Mu couldn\u2019t help but take a closer look at Qin Ran.He muttered in his heart that he still didn\u2019t know what was so good about this high school student.Qin Ran had been called out by Mu Ying.She still hadn\u2019t answered Ning Qing\u2019s call. Ning Qing could only go to the school and call Mu Ying to go to Class 3.9 to find Qin Ran.There was a coffee shop in front of the school, which was quite quiet and had no private rooms.Ning Qing and Lin Wan sat by the window.\u201cWhy are you looking for me?\u201d Qin Ran pulled the chair aside and sat with her legs crossed.She looked like she had no manners.She hasn\u2019t slept well lately, so her eyes were bloodshot and her expression cold and annoyed.Her figure was lazy and she lowered her head halfway, not looking nearly as strong as she did at the police station a few days ago.Like a hooligan.Lin Wan looked at her and frowned subconsciously.Those who would sit on the seat of the Chief were usually people with inside information and who were familiar with the movements of the city.She took the coffee, drank it, and looked away.Ning Qing\u2019s eyes turned to Qin Ran\u2019s left hand. She was holding a mobile phone in her left hand and her fingers were long and smooth.Her right hand was slightly exposed and the thread gauze could be seen.Ning Qing remembered that she wrote with her left hand and was left-handed.She was relieved that her left hand was fine.\u201cYour hands\u2026 are you okay?\u201d Ning Qing uneasily grasped her wallet and said.\u201cIt\u2019s ok, I won\u2019t become crippled.\u201d Qin Ran kicked the trash can beside her.Ning Qing didn\u2019t know what to say and just opened her mouth.Qin Ran ran out of patience. She frowned and was quite irritable. \u201cIs there anything else? Otherwise, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201dNing Qing looked at Qin Ran and clutched her purse even tighter. \u201cYour injury doesn\u2019t seem to be a big problem. About Xu Shen\u2026\u201dQin Ran leaned back, squinting at her indifferently.Ning Qing remained silent for a while.Lin Wan put the cup on the table. She looked at Qin Ran and spoke slowly as if she was on higher grounds. \u201cQin Ran, I don\u2019t wish for Xu Shen\u2019s matter to go to the courts.\u201d\u2014From 15 Feb 2020, Coins spent on books that aren\u2019t selected will be refunded within 30 days.

Could Lin Qi\u2019s stepdaughter also have such an expression?In the blink of an eye, the girl had withdrawn her gaze and lowered her eyes slightly.Qin Ran sat down with her back against the window. The window was half open and her expression couldn\u2019t be seen against the light.Lin Wan sneered lightly. She must have seen wrongly, how could she have that kind of expression?Ning Qing felt like her thoughts were very normal, but she didn\u2019t dare to face Qin Ran directly and just squeezed the teacup subconsciously.\u201cQin Ran, you broke Xu Shen\u2019s hand and his movements are difficult now, more so than your hand.\u201d Lin Wan lifted the teacup, shaking it slightly and saying in a gentle voice, \u201cYou only injured your right hand, and you\u2019re left-handed too, so your injury won\u2019t affect your daily life at all. Why do you bother to fight this lawsuit that isn\u2019t beneficial to you?\u201dLin Wan slowed her speech and saw that Qin Ran wasn\u2019t speaking. She thought that she had listened to her and couldn\u2019t help but say a few more words.Qin Ran didn\u2019t look at her and just knocked the teacup slightly with her left hand.She leaned back lazily against the back of the chair, carefree and unruly.She raised her eyebrow. \u201cContinue.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just messing around among kids.\u201d Lin Wan slowed down a little and continued speaking, \u201cYou and that girl didn\u2019t suffer much anyway, so why must you cling on to it? Even if it was self-defense, because of the little injury you suffered, the most he will be punished with is to pay for the medical expenses after the lawsuit. He might not even be sentenced to jail, so why bother?\u201dIt was such a good reason.Because her hands were fine, because Pan Mingyue was fine, so everything could be treated as if nothing had happened.Qin Ran felt a fire rise inexplicably in her heart, hot and dry.It only needed a little spark of flame to be ignited.\u201cOh.\u201d Qin Ran tilted her head and looked at Lin Wan at that moment, her lips curled and a low chuckle in her throat. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t? What if I want to investigate it?\u201dLin Wan was a little surprised and raised her eyebrow slightly.She didn\u2019t expect Qin Ran to be so stubborn.Because of her good marriage, the Lin family basically followed her words, so she was used to being overbearing and always ordered people around.\u201cHere is one and a half million yuan. In addition to the Xu family\u2019s one million yuan, I will compensate for the other half a million yuan,\u201d Lin Wan said in a suppressed tone and took out the cheque from the bag. She then pushed it to Qin Ran\u2019s side.Lin Wan\u2019s patience had reached its limit.One and a half million yuan was already an astronomical figure for someone who had never seen big money since young.Lin Wan knew Ning Qing very well. She was selfish, timid, vain, and greedy.Her daughter was probably the same.Qin Ran looked at the cheque on the table and lowered her eyes.Lin Wan picked up the teacup again and took a sip. Then, she saw that Qin Ran was staring at the cheque and said, \u201cThis is a cheque, you can go to the bank to exchange it for cash.\u201dQin Ran just chuckled casually.Did she really think she was a fool? She didn\u2019t even know what a cheque was?\u201cDid someone come and find you? Let me guess, was it Deputy Shen?\u201d Qin Ran\u2019s voice was very soft as she stared at Ning Qing and said in an undulating voice, \u201cWhat benefit has he given you? What big favor has he done for you? Was it worth letting down your dignity and putting on a show as a good mother?\u201dNing Qing and Lin Wan didn\u2019t expect Qin Ran to have guessed it.She was actually accurate.Ning Qing pursed her lips and finally couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cQin Ran, how could you say that? What have you learned from your grandmother all these years\u2026\u201d\u201cSince when have you cared about me since young? You only know how to finger point at this moment.\u201d Qin Ran raised her hand and threw the cup on the table.\u201cBam!\u201dShe looked at the brown coffee swaying in the teacup and felt very disinterested.\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Qin Ran pulled her chair and stood up.\u201cOne and a half million yuan is enough for you to live a carefree life for some time. Young girl, don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew and have too high of a standard. When you fall miserably, the gains won\u2019t make up for your loss.\u201d Lin Wan opened her mouth intentionally after sitting at the side calmly.Did she think that one and a half million yuan was too little? She wanted her to know her place?Qin Ran nodded and looked at Lin Wan. She didn\u2019t drink the coffee on the table, just licked her lips and said, \u201cI also think you\u2019re right. One shouldn\u2019t bite off more than they can chew, or they will fall miserably.\u201dLin Wan heard her words and felt her heart jump suddenly.She thought about it and couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong.She watched as Qin Ran turned and left the coffee shop.Lin Wan smiled gracefully and said, \u201cI remember that you have a grandmother in the city\u2019s hospital? Your grandmother\u2019s ward and doctor have all been arranged by my brother.\u201dQin Ran\u2019s footsteps halted and she turned sideways.Her dark eyes did not seem panicked as Lin Wan had imagined.On the contrary, it was undulated and extremely cold.\u201cAre you angry?\u201d Lin Wan was accustomed to power and didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with her behavior. \u201cOf course, I wouldn\u2019t do anything to harm your grandmother. But you should also think about it, you need our Lin family\u2019s help even to find a hospital and a doctor, so\u2014\u201dLin Wan chuckled softly. \u201cYou can guess\u2026 do you think I will let you find a lawyer in Yun Cheng who is willing to help you fight this lawsuit?\u201d\u201cRan Ran, just listen to me!\u201d Ning Qing heard this, panicked, and said with a dry throat.\u201cSigh, what a big issue.\u201d A clear male voice sounded from behind the door lazily. \u201cLawyer Qi, did you hear that? If you don\u2019t come to Yun Cheng, we will degenerate to the point where we can\u2019t even find a single lawyer, alright?\u201dLiked it?

Qin Ran\u2019s back was to him and he couldn\u2019t see her face from this angle, but he could see that the woman opposite her had her chin raised high in an arrogant and bossy manner.Lu Zhaoying ordered a cup of coffee from the lady at the counter. \u201cOne cup for takeaway, thank you.\u201dCheng Juan didn\u2019t want coffee. He just leaned slightly on the counter and stared lazily over at Qin Ran.He bit his cigarette and didn\u2019t move.After taking the coffee, Lu Zhaoying was about to go down. He had found an excuse to enter but didn\u2019t really want to disturb Qin Ran.Before the two of them reached the exit, they heard a voice that made them feel uncomfortable. \u201cYou can guess\u2026 do you think I will let you find a lawyer in Yun Cheng who is willing to fight your lawsuit?\u201dTheir voices weren\u2019t low and could be heard clearly as long as they paid attention.Both of them knew about Xu Shen.It seemed the woman was threatening Qin Ran.Lu Zhaoying had been with Cheng Juan for so many years and had yet to find anyone who dared to compete with Master Juan in Beijing. Those who dared to do so had all been suppressed by Master Juan.Indeed, Cheng Juan\u2019s footsteps stopped, and he turned his head slightly and waited.Without any expression on his face, he said three concise words, \u201cLu Zhaoying.\u201dLu Zhaoying had already taken out his phone and pressed the numbers.Without waiting for Qin Ran to speak, he said directly to the person on the other end of the phone, \u201cLawyer Qi, did you hear that? If you don\u2019t come to Yun Cheng, we will degenerate to the point where we can\u2019t even find a single lawyer, alright?\u201dIt was almost October and the weather was still hot. There weren\u2019t many people in the shop in the afternoon, so the air conditioning had been turned off.There was an inexplicably dry heat in the air.The sudden voice made Qin Ran\u2019s explosive anger disappear temporarily.Qin Ran turned sideways and saw Lu Zhaoying holding his phone with one hand and his other hand in his pocket. He was looking over with a smile and a raised eyebrow, but his body exuded a strong stance.Lu Zhaoying lifted his chin at Qin Ran and then continued talking to the person on the other end. \u201cQi Chengjun, who\u2019s kidding with you? Come immediately.\u201dHe hung up the phone.\u201cMadam, I don\u2019t ever play around. I\u2019ll let you find lawyers, as many as you want.\u201d Cheng Juan looked at the two of them. \u201cYou can guess too\u2026 if you will die or if I will die.\u201dCheng Juan\u2019s eyes fell on Qin Ran\u2019s face and then slipped to her right hand. He said in a low voice, \u201cCome, let\u2019s go.\u201dQi Chengjun?Lin Wan was familiar with this name. Some time ago, her husband\u2019s family had gotten into a serious economic dispute.It had originally been a dead end, but Old Master had eventually invited this Lawyer Qi who had never lost a case before.Lin Wan had married into a prestigious family, but even that family was almost at the bottom rungs of the circle in the capital city. As for the top rungs, she had never even touched them before.It was also because of this incident that she knew that this Lawyer Qi possessed remarkable skills and was very famous in Beijing.If it wasn\u2019t because he had owed Old Master a favor, Old Master wouldn\u2019t have been able to hire him.Lin Wan stared at Cheng Juan and Lu Zhaoying. Their clothes were good, but there was no brand.Ning Qing\u2019s pupils shrank when she saw them.The memory of Cheng Juan holding a scalpel in front of her at the hospital was fresh in her mind.She turned pale.Lin Wan glanced outside as the three of them got into a black car.From far away, she only saw the very obvious license plate with the word \u201cJing\u201d on it and a Volkswagen logo.She smirked and sneered. \u201cThose two must also be from Beijing in order to know Lawyer Qi, but\u2026 does he think I don\u2019t know Qi Chengjun?\u201dHow could it be so easy to hire Lawyer Qi?Lin Wan put away the cheque on the table, but her expression wasn\u2019t good. She had thought that the girl had never seen the world before and could be dealt with without much effort, but now, it seemed like it was a little troublesome.She faintly felt a sense of unease.At the side, Ning Qing held her teacup and took a sip of coffee with slightly trembling hands.**Qin Ran\u2019s hand was bleeding, so they drove to the school doctor\u2019s office in Cheng Juan\u2019s car.It was lesson time and the school doctor\u2019s office was empty and quiet.Qin Ran sat on the stool at one side, her legs sloping and her jeans a little too short for her, revealing her thin ankles.Cheng Juan took a bandage and propped the back of Qin Ran\u2019s chair with one hand as he retrieved the medicine from behind, his expression slightly cold.The two of them didn\u2019t care much until Cheng Juan leaned forward. The two were extremely close and Qin Ran breathed lightly.Cheng Juan paused for a moment and quickly looked away, his eyes settling on her right hand.\u201cI\u2019ve told you many times not to use force on this hand.\u201d Cheng Juan lowered his head and opened the gauze. He then checked the wound and looked displeased.Were children so rebellious nowadays?He threw the bloody gauze into the trash can and took out a cotton swab. His voice was cold, but his movements were extremely careful.\u201cIt\u2019s my right hand, anyway. I\u2019m left-handed, so it\u2019s fine.\u201d Qin Ran held her chin with her left hand and smiled indifferently.\u201cIsn\u2019t your right hand still your hand? Otherwise, you might as well not want it.\u201d Cheng Juan\u2019s voice was lowered and sounded undulated.But strangely, Qin Ran could hear his anger.Qin Ran glanced at him sideways and said, \u201cI was kidding.\u201d\u201cYour wound is very deep. If it doesn\u2019t recover well, it will leave a scar and hidden dangers.\u201d Cheng Juan nodded and then picked up an ointment to apply on top of the wound. \u201cDon\u2019t use any force, understand?\u201dQin Ran nodded.\u201cDon\u2019t be angry, I just forgot that my right hand was injured.\u201d Qin Ran supported her chin and smiled absent-mindedly. \u201cAnytime I bleed, I\u2019ll come to find you here, and then it\u2019ll be fine.\u201dCheng Juan was stunned. He felt as if a stone had dropped into his heart, causing ripples on the surface.He responded and slowly began to bandage the wound.**Ning Qing didn\u2019t go back with Lin Wan.She went to the hospital instead.\u201cWhy are you here now?\u201d Ning Qing usually visited Chen Shulan in the morning and only stayed for about an hour.Her timing had always been regular.So Chen Shulan felt it was strange to see Ning Qing in the evening.Ning Qing picked up an apple and peeled it. She had obviously not done this in a long time and her movement was slow.\u201cIt\u2019s about Ran Ran.\u201d Ning Qing was silent for a while before finally saying, \u201cShe has had a conflict with Teacher Xu\u2019s son. It\u2019s just a dispute amongst children, but they want to take it to the court.\u201dShe went over the matter briefly.Finally, she sighed and said, \u201cMom, Ran Ran only listens to you. Help me say a few words to her. She has injured her hand a little, but both of the other party\u2019s hands are broken. Why did she have to offend the bureau?\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Chen Shulan stood up in worry. \u201cRan Ran injured her hand?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s her right hand, and it has been stitched. She is left-handed, so it won\u2019t affect her\u2026\u201dBefore Ning Qing could finish talking, Chen Shulan interrupted her. \u201cA few stitches on her right hand? Who told you that Ran Ran is left-handed? Her right hand\u2026 do you know how important it is?!\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She gasped and raised her head. \u201cHow is Ran Ran\u2019s hand?\u201dAlthough she didn\u2019t ask much and didn\u2019t know much about young people\u2019s gadgets, she knew that Qin Ran played the violin well and the teacher from Beijing had even visited her.\u201cMom, sit down first.\u201d Ning Qing didn\u2019t expect Chen Shulan to care so much about Qin Ran\u2019s hand injury. She helped her onto the bed and said, \u201cHer hand is alright. She\u2019s in school now, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dChen Shulan gasped and her breathing returned to normal.\u201cMom, did you say that Ran Ran isn\u2019t left-handed? What do you mean?\u201d Ning Qing poured a glass of water and handed it to Chen Shulan before clearing her throat and asking.Chen Shulan didn\u2019t take the water and just stared at Ning Qing.Her eyes were cloudy, but she knew everything.\u201cYou don\u2019t like Ran Ran, right?\u201d Chen Shulan\u2019s voice was soft, her expression was sullen and she was in low spirits.Ning Qing\u2019s expression changed. \u201cMom, I admit, I\u2019m biased towards Yu\u2019er, but Ran Ran is also my daughter and my flesh.\u201d\u201cWhat if it was Yu\u2019er? If her hand had been injured because of Xu Shen, would you tell Yu\u2019er to settle?\u201d Chen Shulan asked her softly.\u201cHow could it\u2026\u201dHow could it be the same?Qin Yu was doted on in the Lin family and was very talented in playing the violin. Lin Wan protected her so much as well. If her hand had been injured by Xu Shen, besides Lin Wan, even Lin Qi and the rest wouldn\u2019t let Xu Shen go.But before she could say this, Ning Qing stopped.\u201cLook, this is the difference.\u201d Chen Shulan coughed a few more times and looked out the window. \u201cRan Ran has to be managed by someone. I once thought that I could entrust her to you before I die\u2026\u201d\u201cMom, you\u2026\u201d Ning Qing sobbed and felt uncomfortable as she reached out to help Chen Shulan.Chen Shulan brushed her hand away.She held onto the bed and got up by herself, letting the nurse help her get her clothes down.\u201cMom, what are you doing?\u201d Ning Qing was stunned and also stood up.\u201cI\u2026 I have to see Ran Ran.\u201d Chen Shulan gasped and her eyes were wet. \u201cIf I\u2026 if I can\u2019t even protect her and stand by her side, do you really want her to be all by herself?!\u201d\u201cMom, your body is already like this, how can you go out?\u201d Ning Qing held Chen Shulan in panic and said, \u201cI\u2019ll listen to you, I\u2019ll listen to you. I\u2019ll treat her well, don\u2019t be angry\u2026 Doctor! Doctor! Call the doctor!\u201d**Qin Ran was half-lying on the table, and the cold fragrance floated over from the opposite side.She hadn\u2019t slept for almost two nights.She had almost taken all the sleeping pills and they still didn\u2019t work.But now she was drowsy.Cheng Juan finished treating Qin Ran\u2019s wound and when he looked up, he saw that she had fallen asleep on the table.His left hand was pressed down by her sleeve.At this angle, he could see half of her face under the shadow. Her long eyelashes were drooping down and the bottom of her eyes was light blue and black.Cheng Juan sat on the opposite side for a long while before he whispered, \u201cHow could she fall asleep like this\u2026\u201dLu Zhaoying smothered his cigarette and came in from outside.He had seen the wound on Qin Ran\u2019s hand once. Lu Zhaoying had suffered many injuries since young, big and small\u2014an injury to his abdomen had almost killed him before.But at the sight of Qin Ran\u2019s stitched wound, he couldn\u2019t bear to look at it.Lu Zhaoying suddenly understood why it had been the doctor who had helped stitched Qin Ran\u2019s wound that night.When he walked in, he saw Cheng Juan gently pull his hand out. Lu Zhaoying asked with a smirk, \u201cShe\u2019s asleep?\u201dCheng Juan nodded and motioned for Lu Zhaoying to follow him out.The two of them stood in the yard. Cheng Juan took out a cigarette but didn\u2019t light it, just clamped it between his lips. \u201cHas Qi Chengjun arrived?\u201dLu Zhaoying took out his mobile phone to look at the time before touching his ear studs. \u201cHe got onto the plane when I called, so he should have just gotten off. Cheng Mu checked. That Lin Wan is from the Shen family.\u201d\u201cShen family?\u201d Cheng Juan squinted his eyes and tilted his head, looking confused.He seemed to be thinking about what the Shen family was.\u201c\u2026 Actually, I don\u2019t know very well.\u201d Lu Zhaoying coughed twice. There were hundreds of families in Beijing and Young Master Lu only remembered a few. He touched his head and said, \u201cAnyway, they\u2019re done for.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Cheng Juan responded in a frustrated low tone and still didn\u2019t light the cigarette. \u201cI want one of Xu Shen\u2019s hands.\u201d\u201cIs it appropriate?\u201d Lu Zhaoying knew about internal affairs. \u201cI heard that the Xu family is Qin Ran\u2019s teacher.\u201dLu Zhaoying seemed to know a lot about Qin Ran despite only knowing her for a short while.It seemed like the Xu family had a close relationship with Qin Ran.Cheng Juan turned slowly and said with dark eyes in an unhurried tone, \u201cSo what?\u201dLu Zhaoying laughed.He had forgotten, this was Master Juan who wasn\u2019t afraid of anything.**The next day.Ning Qing accompanied Chen Shulan for one night and felt mostly guilty when she occasionally thought about Qin Ran\u2019s right hand.She thought mostly of Chen Shulan\u2019s words.Qin Ran\u2019s right hand\u2026She pressed her temple and felt vaguely vexed as she entered the Lin family\u2019s house.Lin Wan was sitting on the sofa.She had obviously rested well. She had delicate makeup on her face and was applying lipstick.When she saw that Ning Qing was back, she glanced over. \u201cHow was it? What did your mother say?\u201d\u201cMy mother\u2026\u201d Ning Qing\u2019s hands tightened. She was a little afraid of Lin Wan, especially since Chen Shulan wasn\u2019t willing to advise Qin Ran. With Qin Ran\u2019s hot temper, she surely wouldn\u2019t let it go.\u201cForget it, I get it.\u201d Lin Wan sneered. \u201cIn that case, don\u2019t blame me for not thinking for your elder daughter.\u201d\u201cLittle aunt!\u201d Ning Qing\u2019s eyes tightened. \u201cRan Ran, besides her right hand, her left hand\u2026\u201dLin Wan kept her lipstick and stood up, not bothering to listen further to Ning Qing.In the end, whether it was Qin Ran or Ning Qing, they weren\u2019t even considered opponents in her life and weren\u2019t even worth a ripple.Besides Qin Yu, Lin Wan didn\u2019t care about anyone else in the Ning family.At this time, Lin Wan\u2019s phone rang. It was Deputy Shen, so she picked up.Lin Wan was calm, to begin with.But after she heard what he said, her expression changed drastically.Liked it?

I have been suspended!\u201dLin Qi had promised to help speak for Deputy Shen, but Lin Wan hadn\u2019t.As long as there was an opportunity, Lin Wan would grasp it.In her eyes, Qin Ran was just her sister-in-law\u2019s daughter from her second marriage and was different from Qin Yu. She was accustomed to the luxurious power in Beijing and so didn\u2019t even bother about people like Qin Ran.She had thought that this small matter was easy to resolve, but how was she to know that Qin Ran had only been found yesterday?And the court summons had come today!It was really fast.It was a slap to her face.Lin Wan\u2019s face turned dark.In the Lin family, even Lin Qi had to give her face. She was used to it and had never faced opposition before.\u201cThe good deed your daughter has done!\u201d Lin Wan hung up and sneered, her chest heaving up and down.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ning Qing also froze.Lin Wan took the bag and started packing her stuff. \u201cXu Shen was in a car accident on the way to the court. Coincidentally, the brake was broken. Ning Qing, do you know how many years of sentencing will be given to intentional murder?\u201d\u201cAlso\u2026\u201d Lin Wan walked to the door and sneered again. \u201cGuess, do you think she can find a lawyer today?\u201dAunt Zhang followed behind Lin Wan respectfully and sent Lin Wan out.Ning Qing sat down on the sofa, feeling anxious. She picked up her mobile phone with shaking hands and started to call Qin Ran.**\u201cRan Ran, we\u2019re discussing the content of the group debate today, do you want to do it together?\u201d After lessons, Lin Siran took her pen and notebook and asked Qin Ran in a soft voice.Qin Ran sat in her chair with her eyes lowered. She pressed on the phone that was ringing wildly and used her left hand to flip her books.\u201cI\u2019m only there to sell my face. Just give me the speech when it\u2019s time, you guys can go,\u201d Qin Ran said casually.Lin Siran also felt like Qin Ran wouldn\u2019t be discussing anything there, so she nodded and went out with her book.Class 3.9\u2019s debate contest was full of passion.Carrying a basketball, Qiao Sheng sat down on Lin Siran\u2019s table. He turned his head and said, \u201cYou actually participated in such a boring activity? I would have signed up if I had known.\u201dQin Ran collected the foreign documents and responded casually, \u201cI\u2019m just there to sell my face.\u201dShe picked up her phone and stood up.In the past two days, she was wearing loose school uniform pants and a white T-shirt without a coat. From the side, the wide school uniform pants made her seem extremely thin.Qiao Sheng smirked. He put away the basketball and turned around. \u201cAre you going to the cafeteria? Lin Siran asked me to line up for you.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Qin Ran tucked her phone into her pocket and grabbed her thermos. She then said in a slightly moody tone, \u201cI\u2019m going to the school doctor\u2019s office to change my ointment.\u201dXu Yaoguang had told Qiao Sheng clearly to avoid the school doctor\u2019s office unless necessary.Qiao Sheng had always kept this in mind. He sent Qin Ran to the gate of the school doctor\u2019s office and carried the basketball to the basketball court.In the early morning, there were only a few people in the school doctor\u2019s office.Qin Ran opened the door and immediately smelled a fragrance\u2014She looked inside. Lu Zhaoying was whispering to Cheng Mu, while Cheng Juan was facing a mannequin while standing lazily and holding a scalpel in his hand.He turned back slightly when he heard the door open and said in a low voice, \u201cYou\u2019re here? There\u2019s porridge in the pot.\u201dLu Zhaoying kicked Cheng Mu.Cheng Mu immediately went to the kitchen and filled a bowl of porridge with wolfberry. He brought it to the table and set a few plates of common early breakfast.In the process, he kept peeping at Qin Ran.The phone in Qin Ran\u2019s pocket was still ringing wildly.Looking at the steaming porridge on the table, her cold body and originally low spirits warmed up almost instantly.After she finished eating, Cheng Juan put down the scalpel and walked over slowly to check the wound on her hand.Qin Ran lowered her eyes and looked at the injury on her right hand.Her grandma didn\u2019t know about her hand injury. Besides her, almost everyone around her thought that she was left-handed. Even she was a little confused herself and did whatever she wanted in her daily life.She didn\u2019t pay attention to her injured right hand.She had bumped into it two days ago and it had always bled.She was so used to it that she didn\u2019t feel anything.However, Cheng Juan had told her to come over to eat lunch and he could check on her wound.Subconsciously, Qin Ran had always paid special attention to her right hand when doing anything. She thought about what Cheng Juan had told her and tried her best not to put too much force on it.\u201cThere\u2019s no bleeding.\u201d Cheng Juan loosened his grip and poured a glass of water into the thermos and handed it to her. He looked at her with clear eyes and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay today.\u201dAfter Qin Ran went to class, Cheng Juan looked at her back as she disappeared from his line of sight, before slowly withdrawing his gaze.\u201cCourt opens today.\u201d Lu Zhaoying finished reading the text message on the phone, leaned over, and smiled. \u201cUncle Jiang\u2019s actions are quite fast.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Cheng Juan then picked up the scalpel again, his index finger tapping twice on the back of the knife before saying lazily, \u201cIt\u2019s fast.\u201dCheng Mu was paralyzed while listening to the conversation between them.He was filled with ridicule in his heart. How could Jiang Hui dare to not hurry?If he didn\u2019t hurry, Master Cheng was going to flip Yun Cheng upside down.**Yun Cheng, the court.Qin Ran didn\u2019t answer Ning Qing\u2019s phone. Ning Qing had no choice but to follow behind Lin Wan.Today was a workday and the rush hour had passed, so Yun Cheng\u2019s roads weren\u2019t too crowded.Within half an hour, they arrived at the court.Nobody from Qin Ran\u2019s side was present.Seeing that there was no lawyer on her side, Ning Qing really panicked.She was trembling, and at this time, she didn\u2019t even care about her pride anymore and just called Lin Qi.She walked to a corner and said in an anxious, low voice, \u201cAs soon as she spoke, she talked about which lawyer would be willing to take Ran Ran\u2019s case\u2026\u201dThe Lin family had opened up new markets and had been busy recently, so Lin Qi didn\u2019t know about Lin Wan\u2019s every move.Hearing Ning Qing\u2019s incoherent words, he sorted things out and said in a low voice, \u201cGive the phone to my sister.\u201d\u201cBrother, don\u2019t bother about this matter.\u201d Lin Wan was fearless.She hung up directly and looked at Ning Qing lightly, sneering. \u201cI told you that nobody would dare to take up your daughter\u2019s case.\u201dAt this time, the noisy courtroom suddenly fell quiet.Everyone was looking in one direction.At the gate, the police officer opened the door and a young man walked in, followed by two other people.He turned and took the documents from them, then raised his head and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Ms. Qin\u2019s lawyer. I\u2019m not late, right?\u201dThere was absolute silence in the court!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, he looked at the judge and said very politely, \u201cYou can start.\u201dThe Xu family had hired a middle-aged lawyer with framed glasses and an aggressive appearance.But the young man in front was smiling, clean and gentle. His every movement brought calmness and even a sort of elegance as if he was a celebrity.He didn\u2019t really have the Xu family\u2019s lawyer\u2019s imposing aura.The middle-aged lawyer presented the evidence and spoke eloquently. He fought for Xu Shen and kept going back to the point that Xu Shen was injured.The young man put his hand on his file and only occasionally looked up at the middle-aged lawyer. He looked gentlemanly and had no obvious change in his expression.He kept silent.The middle-aged lawyer presented a series of dossiers, each of them very organized.He spoke until his throat was dry. After he finished, he drank a glass of water and nodded to the judge. \u201cJudge, my statement is finished.\u201dNing Qing stared at the young man closely, feeling uncertainty in her heart.Why didn\u2019t the young man say a word?Wasn\u2019t he Qin Ran\u2019s lawyer?Why didn\u2019t he dispute and argue against him?He was still so young, could he be just a quack?She was still thinking about this when the young man finally stood up. He didn\u2019t present the information and just smiled first. \u201cUnder the special authorization of Ms. Qin, I will act as the litigation agent to participate in the court proceedings. Before that, I will read in detail with regard to the case materials. I have three questions to put forth to the other party.\u201cFirstly, according to the provisions of the law, those who have committed murder, homicide, robbery, kidnapping, and other violent crimes that seriously endanger the safety of the victim, or causes unlawful infringement of the casualty, are not entitled to excessive self-defense. Hence, the excessive self-defense that the other party has raised up does not hold.\u201cSecondly\u2026\u201cThirdly\u2026\u201dThe young man had clear arguments, sufficient evidence, clear organization, and refined language.There seemed to be an obvious magical power that attracted everyone, even Lin Wan, without any traces.His wording was compact and his structure cautious. It was clear he had done his homework.The middle-aged lawyer couldn\u2019t find a place to interrupt nor rebut and was sweating from the top of his forehead.\u201cMr. Honorable Judge, I believe that you will be able to conclude that this is the most rigorous and grave accusation.\u201d The young man smiled slightly.In less than twenty minutes of his speech, he had led the jury to watch a big show.The lawyer on the opposite side was simply stunned by his statement.Not to mention the jury.This lawsuit ended very quickly.Lin Wan was still in a daze.The middle-aged lawyer stood up from his table and stared at the slightly familiar face of the young man. \u201cExcuse me, you\u2026 you are\u2026\u201d\u201cBeijing\u2019s Junfan Law Firm\u2019s Qi Chengjun.\u201d The young man gathered his documents and spoke elegantly.With just one sentence, he showed off his ability.Yun Cheng wasn\u2019t far from Beijing, and most of the lawyers here had graduated from Beijing.No one that engaged in law didn\u2019t know about the Qi Chengjun who had sprung up in the capital.Lin Wan felt like that young man was familiar before. As soon as the other party spoke, she plopped back on the chair.Nobody around spoke, and Lin Wan\u2019s face turned pale suddenly.Qi Chengjun?Was it really him?Qi Chengjun\u2019s reputation and power in Beijing had been recognized as valiant.He was a law advisor to a number of highly qualified enterprises.Back then, the Shen family had spent so much effort to ask for Qi Chengjun. Now, Qi Chengjun was actually seen in a place like Yun Cheng that wasn\u2019t even considered a second-tier city?If Old Master was to know about this\u2026Lin Wan shivered and suddenly realized that she had really messed up this time!**In the evening, the school doctor\u2019s office.\u201cThe alarm clock is set, remember to take your medicine.\u201d Cheng Juan leaned back on the sofa and handed the phone to Qin Ran. \u201cLet Cheng Mu drive you\u2026\u201dQin Ran took the phone and smiled casually. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll just call a taxi.\u201dShe was supposed to go to the hospital to see Chen Shulan, but she didn\u2019t actually want to go.Chen Shulan had called her all of a sudden and told her she wanted to see her.Qin Ran knew that grandma would probably begin to suspect if she didn\u2019t go, so she put on her long-sleeved gown and got ready to go to the hospital.Cheng Juan didn\u2019t speak and only glanced over at her, his gaze cold and clear like a deep lake, his emotions imperceptible.\u201cThen be careful.\u201d Cheng Juan wasn\u2019t happy, but he didn\u2019t say anything else.Could he possibly tie this kid to the car?When Qin Ran left, Lu Zhaoying came over and whispered, \u201cSay, she can\u2019t even move her hand anymore, why is she still acting so cool? Can\u2019t she just whine to us? Sigh.\u201dAt the thought of Ning Qing, Lu Zhaoying felt gloomy again.He thought about it again. With such a mother, who could she possibly show her weakness to\u2026Cheng Juan glanced at him, his mood also low. \u201cGo away.\u201dThen, he pulled on his collar and said agitatedly, \u201cTell Qi Chengjun to come over.\u201dOutside the school.Qin Ran was crouched on the side of the road while waiting for the bus.She was holding her phone in her left hand, looking at her alarm.She had anti-inflammatory drugs and a series of medicines to promote healing in her hand. The doctor had prescribed two kinds of oral medicines, but she had forgotten to take them.She never cared about such things and only took them when she remembered. She wouldn\u2019t die if she didn\u2019t take them, anyway.Cheng Juan felt like her attitude wasn\u2019t good.She had gone back to the dormitory to get a medicine bottle and poured the medicine out bottle by bottle. She carefully counted the remaining pills and found that she had missed out on six pills.Thus, she was setting an alarm on her phone to remind herself when to take her medicine.The bus came.Qin Ran kept her phone.Half an hour later, she arrived at the hospital.Qin Ran had just entered the inpatient building when she saw Ning Qing and Lin Wan at the payment area.\u201cRan Ran.\u201d Ning Qing saw her and immediately waved her over.Lin Wan was thinking about something, but she also raised her head when she heard this. She never looked straight at Qin Ran before, so it was rare that she smiled at her.\u201cYour aunt is paying for your grandma\u2019s hospital fees.\u201d Ning Qing went over and wanted to pull Qin Ran\u2019s hand.Qin Ran avoided it.Ning Qing\u2019s movement paused.Qin Ran looked up and glanced at them.\u201cDon\u2019t be angry at me regarding Xu Shen.\u201d Lin Wan didn\u2019t seem to be embarrassed and changed the subject when this matter came up. \u201cWe\u2019re family, it\u2019s best for us to be on good terms. My brother\u2019s expenses from last time have been used up, so I have come to pay for your grandma\u2019s hospital fees\u2026\u201dShe wanted to use this method to persuade\u2026 or to threaten Qin Ran to compromise with her.Qin Ran stared at Lin Wan. She narrowed her eyes and chuckled lightly. \u201cGrandma came to Yun Cheng for you to take care of her, and I never intervene in her affairs. I might have compromised too much in regards to matters about grandma, causing you to develop the wrong idea. Do you really think that I can only be forced to listen to your words and be at your mercy?\u201dShe tucked her phone in her pocket and pulled out a bank card.She said calmly, \u201cPlease pay for the Ward No. 1102.\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: How Sacred Is Ms. Qin?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euThe nurse was still on duty and was sitting at the cash register. She took the card and was stunned for a moment.The eleventh floor of this inpatient building was a VIP special ward. Rich and powerful people stayed here, and the nurse was accustomed to seeing various bodyguards.She reacted and asked, \u201cHow long?\u201dEach room in this inpatient building was equipped with a dedicated care worker. The cost of a month of accommodation and care was 37,000 yuan. In addition to the medical equipment and equipment inspection fees that occurred once in a few days, it cost at least 50,000 yuan a month.Qin Ran said casually, \u201cOne year.\u201dOne year\u2019s accommodation and nursing expenses amounted to more than 400,000 yuan. The nurse swiped the card and asked Qin Ran to enter her password several times before she opened the bill.After paying, Qin Ran took the bill and turned to walk towards Chen Shulan\u2019s ward.Lin Wan and Ning Qing stood a few steps behind, dumbfounded.In a trance, Ning Qing seemed to have seen the grumpy Qin Ran who sulked and hit others as described in the information.Qin Ran\u2019s reputation for being difficult to mess with wasn\u2019t just a rumor. Very few people in the school dared to touch her, and her aura was so strong that even Lin Wan didn\u2019t dare to breathe too loudly.In Chen Shulan\u2019s ward, the doctor was holding her records and asking her questions routinely before ending work.Qin Ran didn\u2019t interrupt him and just leaned on the edge of the bed. She tilted her head slightly and listened carefully to the doctor.Once the doctor left, Qin Ran pulled out a shorter chair and sat by the hospital bed to pour a glass of water for Chen Shulan.The jacket she was wearing today had long sleeves, and when she didn\u2019t roll it up, her hand would be covered. Her right hand was covered by the sleeves and the gauze couldn\u2019t be seen.Chen Shulan smiled naturally as if she didn\u2019t know that Qin Ran\u2019s hand was injured.\u201cHow have you been sleeping lately?\u201d Chen Shulan touched her head and asked softly.Qin Ran hadn\u2019t slept well these two days, probably because she had been too tired. But since yesterday, her sleep quality had improved. She put her left hand on the bed and chatted casually with Chen Shulan before feeling drowsy.When she fell asleep, Chen Shulan stopped smiling.She slowly lifted the quilt and waved the nurse away. Then, she squatted beside Qin Ran and pulled her sleeves up to reveal her covered right hand.It was wrapped in layers of gauze.Chen Shulan stared at it solemnly for a long while.She knew very well what kind of person Qin Ran was. She fought with others since young and didn\u2019t care about where she was injured. If Chen Shulan hadn\u2019t found out about her injury sometimes, Qin Ran really wouldn\u2019t have even dealt with the wound.Even if it still bled after bandaging it twice, it was considered normal.How was she like Qin Yu, who would fall to the ground while crying, letting Ning Qing and Qin Hanqiu coax her?Qin Ran\u2019s right hand was wrapped in layers of gauze and Chen Shulan knew that she had a few stitches on it. She felt terrible and only saw that something was strange after a few seconds.The wound was clean and fresh and there wasn\u2019t a trace of blood.It looked well taken care of at first glance, completely different from what Chen Shulan had thought.Chen Shulan looked at the clean gauze and fell deep in thought.**The Lin family\u2019s house.Ning Qing and Lin Wan hadn\u2019t paid the bill successfully and didn\u2019t dare to see Chen Shulan, so they went back to the Lin family\u2019s house in a sullen mood.Ning Qing was feeling very confused.Lin Qi had pushed back several meetings today to come home earlier.He didn\u2019t expect Qin Ran\u2019s case to end so quickly, and for the trial results to come out as well. In fact, it usually took one to two weeks for a trial to be over.His gaze fell on Lin Wan and he asked with his fingertips clasped on the lid of the teacup, \u201cWhat happened to you today?\u201d\u201cBrother, I thought\u2026\u201d Lin Wan had always felt like Qin Ran was a high school student with no financial ability, so she had never taken her into consideration before.But who knew that things would become like this?\u201cI said before that Ran Ran should decide how to handle matters.\u201d Lin Qi put the teacup on the table with a \u201cbam\u201d and said with a pair of shining eyes, \u201cThis is Yun Cheng, not your capital. What do you mean by there will be no lawyers for Ran Ran\u2019s case as long as you\u2019re here? Lin Wan, listen, is that something an elder should say? Huh?!\u201dHe was a businessman and was always open-minded and magnanimous, so even the way he spoke was also humble.It was rare for him to be so angry.The servant didn\u2019t even dare to breathe.Lin Wan hadn\u2019t been reprimanded by Lin Qi for many years. She felt like he wasn\u2019t giving her face now and flushed instantly.Lin Qi\u2019s eyes turned to Ning Qing again. \u201cAnd you? What were you doing following her blindly? That\u2019s your daughter, not your enemy. You don\u2019t even believe your own daughter, how could you be a mother?\u201cLin Wan, I want you to pack up and return to Beijing tomorrow!\u201d He had a headache from his anger and was too lazy to talk nonsense to these two women.He took his phone and went upstairs to call Qin Ran.Lin Jinxuan pursed her lips and looked at his phone.In the past two days, he had called Qin Ran to ask for some information. Her tone had been fairly good and she hadn\u2019t said anything. Only now did he know that Qin Ran\u2019s hand was stitched.His expression went pale as he went upstairs to change his casual clothes and took his car key.Lin Qi was calling Qin Ran on the phone and was surprised to see him take the car key. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see Ran Ran?\u201dHis son had always been indifferent. Ning Qing had been married to the Lin family for so many years and he had never heard him call her \u201cmother\u201d before.Even Qin Yu had to take many years for him to warm up to her.Lin Jinxuan nodded and then frowned again, remembering how she had stayed silent at the police station that night. \u201cI wonder how her hand is.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d Lin Qi thought for a moment and went to the study to take a bank card. \u201cThe password is six 0, take this to Ran Ran.\u201dLin Jinxuan nodded.Qin Yu was practicing the piano, but her thoughts were on what was happening downstairs. When Lin Jinxuan was walking down, she opened the door of the violin room.\u201cBrother, where are you going?\u201d Qin Yu came out holding the violin and smiling. \u201cI just practiced a new piece and it\u2019s much smoother now. Do you want to listen\u2026\u201dLin Jinxuan had enjoyed listening to her play recently.\u201cNo, I just told Qin Ran I would find her in school.\u201d Lin Jinxuan raised his eyebrows, his voice light.Qin Yu gripped the violin tightly and pretended that it was nothing. \u201cOh\u2026\u201d**The school\u2019s medical office.Qi Chengjun put down his documents and surveyed his surroundings, wondering what kind of magic had made Cheng Juan come all the way here.Cheng Juan leaned lazily against the table, looking like a mannequin. He was quiet and attentive and had his eyebrows lowered like a painting.\u201cBrother, we have telepathy. I just called you yesterday and you got on the plane too.\u201d Lu Zhaoying patted Qi Chengjun\u2019s shoulder and chuckled.Qi Chengjun frowned and avoided his hand in disgust. \u201cGo away, who has telepathy with you?\u201dHe thought for a while and then looked at Cheng Juan. \u201cMaster Juan, is Ms. Qin some kind of sacred being?\u201dCheng Juan put down the scalpel on the table and tilted his head as if he had heard wrongly. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat sacred being, she\u2019s just a pitiful one.\u201d Lu Zhaoying snorted softly. \u201cAnd she doesn\u2019t know how to whine.\u201d\u201cHuh, no way\u2026\u201d Qi Chengjun was stunned. \u201cThen why did the 129 Detective Agency approach me personally to let me come to Yun Cheng and solve this case?\u201dLiked it?

What\u2019s with 129?\u201d Lu Zhaoying was rarely serious and solemn. \u201cThey take this kind of trivial matter too?\u201dLu Zhaoying couldn\u2019t accept it. He didn\u2019t have much contact with the core members of 129 and only knew that there were a few great experts inside. Out of the experts, one of them was especially expensive and was the most difficult to deal with\u2026But what did it have to do with their little pitiful friend?As for Qin Ran being a member of 129?What a joke.Lu Zhaoying didn\u2019t even think about this possibility.Cheng Juan also narrowed his eyes and stopped paying attention to his mannequin. He dragged a chair over and lifted his chin towards Qi Chengjun. \u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d Qi Chengjun thought for a while and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t ask much, but it seemed to be someone with the surname Feng.\u201d\u201cI know!\u201d Lu Zhaoying patted the table and seemed to have realized something. \u201cUncle Jiang told me before that Feng Loucheng had contacted the Public Security Bureau. He\u2019s the mayor of Yun Cheng, and it was probably due to his approval that the court could be opened so quickly.\u201dCheng Juan had an impression of Feng Loucheng. He was a capable person and had been promoted quickly.\u201cI originally thought that he was showing favor to Master Juan, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d Lu Zhaoying pondered over it. \u201cSo, he did it for Qin Ran?\u201dBut why was it necessary for him to go so far to find Qi Chengjun?He thought that nobody except Master Juan would do such a boring thing.\u201cQin Ran also knows the mayor?\u201d Lu Zhaoying was really surprised.He was also especially curious. How could Qin Ran know Feng Loucheng?He suddenly felt like Qin Ran was mysterious.Her identity was obviously nothing much, but the people involved with her had bigger and bigger backgrounds.Feng Loucheng could be ignored, but 129 wasn\u2019t so easily ignored.Cheng Juan didn\u2019t speak. He had never checked on her background before and had only investigated her files in Ninghai after this case had happened.His understanding of Qin Ran was limited to her relationship with Ning Qing and the Lin family.Her family background was simple and her parents were divorced.Those who played politics were mostly shrewd, so Feng Loucheng didn\u2019t seem like a good old man.\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d Cheng Juan reached out and took his coat. \u201cI\u2019ll revisit the file of Ninghai\u2019s 712 case from three years ago.\u201d**The sky was almost dark when Qin Ran went from the hospital to the school. The street lights outside the school gate were turned on.Lin Jinxuan was standing under the streetlamp, his slender figure tall and straight.At this time, the first evening self-study was taking place and many students had taken advantage of this time to come out for supper.Lin Jinxuan\u2019s eye-catching appearance attracted a lot of attention.Watching as Qin Ran got off the taxi, he frowned slightly, his gaze moving to her hand. \u201cIs your hand ok?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hinder my daily life.\u201d Qin Ran raised her eyebrows.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Lin Jinxuan didn\u2019t know how to get along well with girls. If it had been Qin Yu, she would have cried to him and he would then give her his bank card.As for Qin Ran, she made it seem like it was nothing. Their personalities were too different and Lin Jinxuan was at a loss.\u201cYou have my number on your phone. If you\u2019re in trouble, remember to call me.\u201d Lin Jinxuan sighed. He thought about Ning Qing\u2019s attitude and understood why Qin Ran was behaving like this. \u201cTake this card.\u201dHe thought for a moment and then gently patted her head before saying in a slow voice, \u201cHave you eaten dinner?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Qin Ran avoided him, still very cool. She didn\u2019t say much and just frowned slightly.Not far away, Qin Yu was standing with a group of people with her lips pursed.She already knew that Lin Jinxuan had come out to see Qin Ran, so she had asked the driver to driver over, giving the excuse that she had left her papers in class.\u201cWho is that person next to Qin Ran? He\u2019s so handsome, and he seems quite familiar.\u201d The babyface beside Qin Yu whispered.Qin Yu didn\u2019t speak and just grasped her book tighter with her fingernails.Lin Jinxuan was difficult to get close to. She had tried several years before getting closer to him. Usually, she was the one sticking to him every day, and she rarely saw him take the initiative to get close to someone.This scene was really annoying to her.She just didn\u2019t understand what else Qin Ran had besides her face.She was so studious and was so good at the violin, but why did Qin Ran have everyone surrounding her when she didn\u2019t even do anything?Qin Ran didn\u2019t seem to talk much to Lin Jinxuan and entered the school gate within a few minutes.Lin Jinxuan looked at her back for a few minutes before turning back to drive away.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Qin Yu didn\u2019t go back home and went to her class.She glanced down at her cell phone, her eyes dull.**Qin Ran didn\u2019t go directly to class as the guard called her. \u201cQin Ran, come here, you have a courier.\u201dQin Ran looked good, so the guard recognized her.Recently, all the guards showed concern over her hand and asked more and more questions.\u201cIt\u2019s a little heavy.\u201d The guard picked up the box. \u201cI\u2019ll help you carry it to the door of the dorm, then you can let the dorm auntie bring it up for you.\u201dHe picked up the box easily.Qin Ran had wanted to say that she could do it herself, but the uncle was being very enthusiastic.She touched her chin, smiled, and turned her head slightly. \u201cThen help me get it to class.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dThere were only half of the students in the class tonight. Because the class had ended, they were all sitting around.Lin Siran was discussing a question with Xia Fei when she saw them. She immediately put down her book, took the box, and thanked the guard. Then, she asked, \u201cRan Ran, what\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d Qin Ran sat back in her chair and leaned against the wall, propping her legs up casually.She then took the book in a foreign language called on the table.She had wanted to dig out for candy, but thinking about her hand, she gave up.Lin Siran\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThen can I open it now?\u201d\u201cYou can open it whenever you want.\u201d Qin Ran flipped open her book.Lin Siran immediately asked for a blade and opened the box. Other students came over to watch, and even Qiao Sheng came over to sit on the edge of Lin Siran\u2019s chair.\u201cHurry up, the class is starting.\u201d\u201cIt looks pretty big, is it a doll?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see what gift our Big Boss Qin gave you\u2026\u201d Qiao Sheng said. Before he could finish, he stopped suddenly and looked at Qin Ran, stunned.The crowd who had originally come to watch also fell silent.Liked it?

In five years, he had already won the Chinese Award for his first song during his debut.After his second song became popular in China, it also trended abroad.He didn\u2019t produce many albums every year. As a professional singer, he produced at most ten songs each year, and each of them was a best feature.His style was changeable. Dark, rock, healing, love songs, fresh songs\u2026 he sang everything.Since his debut, he had released a total of six albums, most of which were limited edition and sold out the moment they were released.Yan Xi had thousands of fans, but there weren\u2019t many fans who really collected all his albums.His early albums were basically gone.But right now, in the box in Lin Siran\u2019s hands were six albums neatly placed inside.The most important thing was that these six albums also had a pedestal on the bottom and had a trophy in the shape of a trumpet on it.Everyone in China knew that three months ago, Yan Xi had won the highest international honor award\u2014the Grammy Award.When the news broke, Yan Xi had caused the Weibo server to be down for two hours.The whole nation praised him.No more than five people had received this award in China, but they were all old artists and there was also a band amongst them.Yan Xi was the first person to win this highest honor award with his own personal songs.Many people on the Internet said that he looked like a girl, that he had a sugar daddy behind him, but no one ever insulted his abilities.This Grammy trophy was in the shape of a trumpet and had been put on Weibo for a week, so almost everyone knew about it.After about a minute of silence, Xia Fei pointed to the trophy and stuttered, \u201cOh\u2026 Oh my God!\u201dQiao Sheng also cleared this throat. \u201cThis\u2026 is?\u201dQin Ran thought that just a few albums probably didn\u2019t need such a big reaction?She put aside her book and tilted her head slightly before seeing the trophy on the album.Qin Ran: \u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cI found someone online and ordered from her.\u201d Qin Ran was silent for a moment before taking the trophy back. She put her finger on the trumpet and tapped along the edge. \u201cThe album is yours.\u201dShe finished talking.The crowd also burst like a balloon that had been punctured.\u201cIs this my husband\u2019s album?!\u201d\u201cOh my God, there is his poster as well. I queued for two hours last time and couldn\u2019t even buy it. And this is even a signed version?!\u201d\u201cAhhhhh, what are you doing, Lin Siran?! Let us take a look, let us look! Just! Once!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThese female students didn\u2019t even care about Qiao Sheng and squeezed him aside.The group of girls didn\u2019t stop until the bell of self-study rang. The monitor shouted twice, and when nobody bothered about him, he rubbed his nose and sat down again.The person sitting at the back door stared at the door so that he could inform the class when the director came.When nobody was paying attention to her, Qin Ran opened her Weibo and found an image. Expressionlessly, she sent four words\u2014[Are their brains damaged?]The class was still talking about the albums. A group of girls was chattering away, and even the boys were whispering.Wu Yan\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t very good. She was also a member of this debate contest and was sitting behind writing her manuscript with a pen while checking the information, but everyone around her was talking about Qin Ran and Yan Xi\u2019s album.\u201cLet\u2019s quickly organize the debate materials, it\u2019s starting in a few days.\u201d With Qiao Sheng around, she didn\u2019t dare to offend Qin Ran and only said this as she stood up.Lin Siran immediately asked Qin Ran to help her keep the albums while she took out her notebook and pen to discuss at the back.She got up and stopped again. \u201cRan Ran, are you coming?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Qin Ran threw her phone on the table and replied. \u201cWrite well, I\u2019ll just help you guys read it when it\u2019s time.\u201dAt the back of the classroom. Wu Yan heard this and pursed her lips, her grip tightening on the pen.She raised her head and glanced at Xu Yaoguang, who was holding a pen and writing seriously. He had just taken his gaze away from Qin Ran and didn\u2019t say a word.Wu Yan felt even more depressed.**The next morning, Qin Ran went to the school doctor\u2019s office.Lu Zhaoying wasn\u2019t inside and Cheng Juan helped to inspect her wounds. Her fingertips were a bit cold and the gauze was a little wet. He stared at it for a while and sneered. \u201cDid you dig a mine yesterday?\u201dQin Ran\u2019s hand rested on the table and the wound that had been healing yesterday was bleeding again.She also glanced at it. No wonder it hurt. \u201cNo, I was hit by my roommate yesterday.\u201dWu Yan had been carrying a large basin of water when she was knocked by a girl who had come to look at the album. She had hit the table with her hand and had even been drenched in water.Cheng Juan was silent for a while, thinking about something. Then, he said, \u201cYour agility is useless, eh?\u201dQin Ran put her hands on the table and glanced at him. She didn\u2019t talk back for once and just laughed.This scene was quite familiar. When they were young, Qin Yu\u2019s hand had been injured, so she had pouted and went to find Ning Qing and Qin Hanqiu. They had scolded her fiercely, but their actions had been light as if they were afraid of hurting her.Qin Ran supported her chin and smiled. When she looked back again, she saw a brown envelope wrapped in a file on the table.On it, two words were written: [Ninghai 712].She paused, but her expression remained the same.When Qin Ran was about to return to class, Lu Zhaoying came back with his mobile phone.He saw Qin Ran and hung up the phone. Then, he greeted her and asked her about her hand before entering the school doctor\u2019s office.As soon as he entered, he saw Cheng Juan sitting expressionlessly on the chair with a bloody piece of gauze in front of him. He sneered. \u201cDid you scold Qin Ran again?\u201dCheng Juan withdrew his gaze and stared at him before nodding absent-mindedly.He turned his gaze to the documents and picked it up, saying softly, \u201cThe case file of 712. I looked over it twice and found a few suspicious points. She was indeed present, but the information has been erased.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Lu Zhaoying reacted and realized that Cheng Juan was talking about Qin Ran.He didn\u2019t know what role to play.**Li Airong arranged an English paper during the afternoon.Qin Yu took out her phone and said quietly to the English representative, \u201cI\u2019m about to find the Physics teacher, let me help you get it.\u201dThe English representative was very grateful.When she arrived at the office, Wu Yan was over there to pick up the English papers. Her expression wasn\u2019t very good.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Qin Yu took the English papers and asked casually.Wu Yan was in Qin Yu\u2019s clique. They were all girls and she could feel that Qin Yu also didn\u2019t like Qin Ran.\u201cWe have a debate, and the people in the class have all voted for the representations.\u201d Wu Yan had managed to squeeze into the group after much difficulty and could participate with Xu Yaoguang, but Qin Ran had entered without even raising her hand. At the thought of this, she felt both angry and jealous. \u201cOnly Qin Ran didn\u2019t do anything. Furthermore, they have all unanimously decided that Qin Ran should end the speech, but on what grounds can she do that? She didn\u2019t do anything and can still use our efforts to deliver her speech, what if the teacher asks her about it?\u201dQin Yu listened to her and fell silent.Then, she laughed. \u201cShe probably won\u2019t mess it up.\u201dWu Yan snorted and said a little maliciously, \u201cWho knows? There are a few English idioms in it and she might not say it well.\u201dThe two of them walked all the way and heard a few people discussing Qin Ran.They were still talking excitedly about Qin Ran when they passed and didn\u2019t even look at Qin Yu.Qin Yu grasped the test papers tighter, not used to the feeling of being ignored.They walked to the corner. Wu Yan had to go upstairs and Qin Yu had to go downstairs.\u201cHelp me take the papers, I\u2019m going to the toilet.\u201d Qin Yu paused and handed the papers to Wu Yan.\u201cOkay.\u201d Wu Yan took it.Qin Yu didn\u2019t have a pocket and handed her phone to Wu Yan.Wu Yan took it and put it on top of the test papers.Qin Yu\u2019s phone was unlocked.It lit up at a single touch.Inside was an album.Wu Yan didn\u2019t want to pry into her privacy, so she reached out to turn off the phone, but when she looked at the wallpaper that had lit up, she paused.The background was very dark, and the street lights were turned on. There was a black Mercedes on the side and a man who looked quite old with his back to the camera.The two of them seemed to be holding hands.Wu Yan\u2019s gaze fell on the woman.In the picture, the woman\u2019s face was very clear. Wu Yan\u2019s heart thumped quickly when she recognized her\u2014The person in the picture was Qin Ran.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was the first time she had done such a thing and she felt a little uneasy inside.Qin Yu returned and didn\u2019t find out, so she heaved a sigh of relief.She went back to her class.Wu Yan\u2019s deskmate saw that she was distracted and leaned over. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Wu Yan returned to her senses and nodded.The classroom was filled with students messing around and was very noisy.The next second, the entire class fell silent suddenly.Wu Yan thought that the teacher had come and looked at the back door automatically since the back door was closer to the stairs.At this one glance, she was unable to take her eyes away.There was indeed someone standing at the back door. He had a tall figure, a pair of phoenix eyes, clear and distinct facial features, and the vigorous aura of a youngster.\u201cIt\u2019s Wei Zihang\u2026\u201dSeveral girls around Wu Yan spoke in a low voice and couldn\u2019t help but lean over to look.\u201cHe\u2019s so handsome, I think he\u2019s comparable to Xu Yaoguang. Don\u2019t we need to debate about who the campus king is?\u201d\u201cWho is he looking for?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPeople of this age always had a natural curiosity about the opposite sex, especially towards Wei Zihang, who was a particularly famous school bully. He always had a sense of mystery in the students\u2019 minds.Even if they knew that his results weren\u2019t good, the girls still chased after him.He had been in First Middle School for ten days and also lived on campus. It was rumored that the floor he stayed on didn\u2019t dare to make much noise every night.There was no major incident, but he was particularly hot in the forum.People paid attention to him no matter where he walked.Lin Siran was hugging Yan Xi\u2019s poster when she saw the person leaning against the door. She couldn\u2019t help nudging Qin Ran and asking, \u201cRan Ran, is he looking for you?\u201dWhen she had first known Qin Ran, Lin Siran had been sent back by the school bully\u2019s lackey thanks to her.Qin Ran was still leaning against the wall, a lollipop in her mouth as she glanced over and touched her nose. \u201cYeah.\u201dLin Siran got up and let her out.Outside the door, Wei Zihang was standing straight.He stared at her right hand. \u201cSister Ran, who did this?\u201dHe had asked for a few days of leave and had come to class 3.9 as soon as he heard the news about Qin Ran.\u201cXu Shen.\u201d Qin Ran grinned and seemed to be in a better mood. \u201cI finally had the chance to send him in.\u201d\u201cHe saw Mingyue?\u201d Wei Zihang narrowed his eyes and cursed. \u201cDamn it, why didn\u2019t I meet this bastard!\u201d\u201cI beat him badly.\u201d Qin Ran crushed the lollipop in her mouth and chuckled. \u201cI beat your share too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Wei Zihang thought for a while and then wrinkled his nose disagreeably. \u201cEven if you wanted to send him in, you didn\u2019t need to put your hand on the line. Your hand is way more valuable than his cheap life.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I have my limits.\u201d Qin Ran patted his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cIf my grandpa sees this\u2026\u201d Wei Zihang mumbled and then stopped. \u201cFine, I have to go to class. I\u2019m in class 3.3, come find me if you have anything.\u201dThe two of them spoke quietly so that nobody else could hear.But some discussion about them was inevitable.Qin Ran returned to her seat under everyone else\u2019s gaze.The class was silent.**Late self-study.There weren\u2019t many people in the classroom.Almost half of the boys weren\u2019t in class.\u201cToday Kyushu Tour\u2019s finale, they all went to the toilet to watch the live broadcast,\u201d Lin Siran said to Qin Ran. \u201cIt\u2019s the game you played last time, QTS is too handsome! He got four kills the day before yesterday and got into the final round. He will surely win YKT tonight and win the domestic championship!\u201dKyushu Tour was a global card competition game.Lin Siran didn\u2019t know how to play, but it didn\u2019t stop her from joining in the crowd. That kind of exciting atmosphere was really moving.Qin Ran put her hand on the book and smiled. \u201cYes, they can do it.\u201d\u201cBy the way, Ran Ran, we have almost finished writing our speech. We will be at the comprehensive building tomorrow at noon, do you want to come and watch and prepare?\u201d Lin Siran took out her notebook and asked.Qin Ran thought for a while. \u201cYou just have to familiarize me with it tomorrow morning.\u201dThen, she copied Lin Siran\u2019s English paper.Wu Yan was receiving the English papers when she heard them talking. She glanced over at Qin Ran and said impatiently when she saw her copying the papers, \u201cI\u2019m collecting the papers.\u201dQin Ran glanced at her, then slowly copied the answer until she finished the last option before handing her the answer sheet.**At noon the next day, Qin Ran went to the school doctor\u2019s office to change her medicine.Cheng Juan was on the phone and was shocked for a moment when he saw her.Lu Zhaoying sent away a female student and also came over, laughing. \u201cQin Ran, you changed your style today. You look good.\u201dQin Ran was wearing a long T-shirt today and not the white round neckline she usually wore.The material was very soft, light, and fluffy. It was rose-colored and somewhat long, hanging ten centimeters from her knee. The hem was embroidered with fine white lace.She usually only wore black and white, so this vintage color looked stylish on her, and she looked as good as ever.She was extremely dazzling when she occasionally wore other colors.This rosy color also made her look elegant and her skin looked snow-white.Her legs looked long and thin in her black jeans. In fact, her clothes were very simple and unglamorous, but they somehow still looked good on her.\u201cYeah.\u201d Qin Ran sat down on a chair. \u201cI have a speech at noon and I\u2019m there to sell my face. The clothes are Lin Siran\u2019s.\u201dLin Siran disliked her school uniform pants and insisted that she changed into her clothes. She even wanted to do makeup on her, though Qin Ran strongly opposed it.Cheng Juan was quite silent today and slowly changed her medicine.It was probably because she wasn\u2019t bleeding again.Qin Ran didn\u2019t really want to give the speech. Thinking about it, there were many people there and she was annoyed just at the scene alone.She spent a lot of time idling in the school doctor\u2019s office before heading to the comprehensive building.She was just on time and there were already many people in the classroom. Nearly two hundred people were packed together, buzzing noisily like bees.They were very nervous. There were bonus points to be added this time, and they could be written into the curriculum vitae if they ranked a placing. They could then use it when applying for examinations or other things.Two reporters from the news agencies were recording at the side with their cameras.The atmosphere in the classroom was tense. All the groups were discussing fiercely about how to deal with the question and answer segment.The crowd was restless and the atmosphere was extremely tense.Lin Siran had given the materials to Qin Ran in the morning. Qin Ran had looked over them and had read through the speech a couple of times.Lin Siran and the others were in their seats. Qin Ran saw them immediately in the fourth row. She put down her bag at the seat they had saved for her and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the washroom.\u201dQin Ran wasn\u2019t in the least bit nervous.She went to the washroom and came back.The order of speeches was drawn by lottery.The number Lin Siran drew was average and wasn\u2019t advantageous. They were the fourth to present.Qin Ran sat down, cleared her throat, and opened the bag to take out her speech to take another look at it. However, she realized that the speech, as well as her USB flash drive, were gone.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The crowd was very noisy and she said each word with annoyance, \u201cWho came to my seat just now?\u201dSeveral girls were sitting together and Wu Yan was sitting on her right side, ignoring her.Lin Siran was on her left.She was holding her pen and constantly noting down her ideas in her notebook.She panicked when she heard Qin Ran\u2019s words and turned around to flip through her belongings. \u201cYour speech script is missing? I clearly put it inside for you though?\u201d\u201cWu Yan, have you guys seen Ran Ran\u2019s script and USB flash drive?\u201d Lin Siran looked up and asked.They all shook their heads.Wu Yan laughed satirically. \u201cWe were the ones who put in the hard work for the script, how could you lose it so easily?\u201d\u201cHelp find it.\u201d Lin Siran frowned and didn\u2019t want to start an internal fight at this moment.The rest of the girls also looked around.The USB flash drive was for the slides, but the script had been organized and consisted of four pages. It was really all of their hard work. If it was really lost, the speech they had prepared today would be meaningless.At this moment, Lin Siran suddenly understood Qin Ran\u2019s temper.Qin Ran\u2019s bag had been specially prepared for exams, so there were buttons on it and the things couldn\u2019t have possibly dropped. Someone must have taken it deliberately.The person who had taken them was obviously against them or targeting Qin Ran.But Lin Siran had to admit that this person\u2019s move had really worked. What would they bring to stage when the script was missing?\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Xu Yaoguang turned around from the front row when he heard their voices and asked, his gaze cold.He was always difficult to get close to, and his voice was both soft and cold.Lin Siran stood up and looked around her. Then, she looked anxiously at Xu Yaoguang. \u201cOur script and USB drive are lost.\u201dXu Yaoguang didn\u2019t expect this.Lin Siran was so angry her eyes were red.She looked around again, wondering who could have done this.\u201cLet\u2019s look around first.\u201d Xu Yaoguang calmed down, stood up, and instructed. \u201cLook in the trash can outside the corridor.\u201dQiao Sheng took him as a leader and he had great prestige in class as well.As soon as he spoke, a few people stood up and went out.Wu Yan also stood up, but she glanced at Xu Yaoguang and pursed her lips.Xu Yaoguang had always had an opinion towards Qin Ran. In the beginning, everyone in the class could tell that he didn\u2019t really like her.Who knew that before long, Xu Yaoguang didn\u2019t even refuse when Lin Siran had asked Qin Ran to do the speech.Now that the script was lost in Qin Ran\u2019s hands, he didn\u2019t blame her and was even helping her find it.A few people went out to help look around and it would be awkward if she didn\u2019t go as well.Wu Yan couldn\u2019t help but look at Xu Yaoguang again. He was asking Qin Ran something with his head lowered.She looked away and followed behind the other girls.The speech had already begun and class 3.1 was presenting now. The speaker was Qin Yu, which wasn\u2019t a surprise. She held her paper and spoke with clear enunciation, and they were all listening seriously.She looked down and saw Xu Yaoguang, who had been watching her, suddenly exit from the back door, followed by Qin Ran.The smile on Qin Yu\u2019s face faded and then she quickly smiled again.After her speech, the judges asked a few questions and she answered them one by one. The other members of the group also came up with several representatives.Next, the judges discussed and scored them.Qin Yu came down and went back to her seat. She was sitting in the third row and was very close to Xu Yaoguang.\u201cWhy did all the people from class 3.9 go out?\u201d Qin Yu looked through the back door and asked thoughtfully.\u201cI think Qin Ran lost their USB flash drive and their script.\u201d Although class 3.9 had little movement, they were all sitting in a row, so they basically knew what had happened.Qin Yu turned her head in surprise. \u201cShe lost the script? Qin Ran is in big trouble this time.\u201dThe news reporters on both sides were all racked up already. If something were to go wrong, the school and the teachers would all lose their faces.Qin Yu appeared worried, but the corners of her lips were curled up.**Class 3.9 searched around and finally found the torn script in the trash can and the USB flash drive soaked in water.Lin Siran clenched her teeth. \u201cSomeone was obviously trying to frame Ran Ran. She must be jealous of Ran Ran!\u201dEveryone standing around the trash can fell silent.This was obviously directed at Qin Ran and was obviously a malicious move.Wu Yan couldn\u2019t help but blame Qin Ran. \u201cThat\u2019s great, now our class doesn\u2019t even have our script.\u201d\u201cWu Yan, don\u2019t say that.\u201d Someone couldn\u2019t help but pull Wu Yan\u2019s sleeves when she saw Qin Ran lean against the wall, her hands tightening around a mineral water bottle.\u201cWhy can\u2019t I say that? I already said not to let her come, now she has harmed us!\u201dXu Yaoguang stared at her coldly. Wu Yan pursed her lips and stopped talking.The judges had already given their scores and the next one up was their class.Xu Yaoguang glanced at Qin Ran, thought for a while, and then said in a low voice, \u201cLin Siran, give me your notebook, I\u2019ll go up.\u201dHe had also written a part of the script and the whole process had been organized by him.He remembered every point but just couldn\u2019t remember all the details.Without a manuscript, nobody else was more suitable than him.\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201dQin Ran glanced at Wu Yan, adjusted her clothes, and reached out to pinch the mineral water bottle.There wasn\u2019t any more water in it, so it crashed into the trash can and made a clattering sound before falling inside.She walked forward without looking back. \u201cI\u2019ll go up.\u201dLiked it?

This matter isn\u2019t your fault. Let Xu\u2026\u201dBut she failed to hold Qin Ran.Qin Ran didn\u2019t stop walking. She waved at Lin Siran and said softly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dThey had already arrived in the classroom and the judges were already scoring. It was their class\u2019s turn soon, and when Lin Siran saw Qin Ran walking towards the podium, she quickly grabbed her notebook from her desk. \u201cThen I\u2019ll give you my notebook!\u201dQin Ran was already standing by the side of the podium, her fingertips slightly cold.At the same time, the judges finished their scoring.There were several city-level leaders in the jury, and they all gave the average score after removing the highest and the lowest score. Qin Yu got a score of 8.7.The rest of them were still discussing her presentation.The highest scores obtained by the first two classes were only 7.6, so Qin Yu\u2019s score was by far the highest.\u201cWe got 8.7,\u201d the girl next to Qin Yu suppressed her excitement and said excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest score!\u201dHer score was much higher than the others and they all started talking about Qin Yu.All eyes were gathered on her.Qin Yu pursed her lips and smiled. She already saw that Xu Yaoguang and the others were back, so she turned to them and asked, \u201cHave they found their script?\u201d\u201cI saw that Qin Ran went up empty-handed, so I don\u2019t think they did.\u201d The girl shook her head. \u201cIf they do badly now, the dean will surely be angry.\u201d\u201cHow could he not be angry if she does badly in front of the municipal leaders? I heard that Qin Ran was the one who kept the scripts, she\u2019s really\u2026\u201d Another girl also whispered.Qin Yu smiled, got up, and went to the leaders to get her feedback.While the leaders complimented Qin Yu, the others whispered amongst themselves. It seemed like they were talking about Qin Ran, and two people even praised the school for having good-looking students.Qin Yu was familiar with the dean, so she lowered her eyes and whispered, \u201cDean, Qin Ran\u2019s class lost their script, so it might not be too smooth\u2026 don\u2019t make things too difficult for her.\u201dThe Dean was shocked, then he nodded.His expression wasn\u2019t too good.If the script was lost, it was an attitude problem.**Soon, it was class 3.9\u2019s turn.Lin Siran was sitting on her seat, signaling Qin Ran with her notebook. Qin Ran didn\u2019t come back to take the notebook, just gestured for Lin Siran to rest assured.Rest assured?How could Lin Siran possibly feel rest assured?Xu Yaoguang sat firmly and glanced at Qin Ran.She was standing straight and her face wasn\u2019t as absent-minded and inattentive as before. She looked more serious now and was so natural she didn\u2019t look like she had stage-fright.She didn\u2019t look like she was messing around.He paused and relaxed his eyebrows. \u201cSince she said not to worry, then she must be confident.\u201dThe other people were still looking for the script. Class 3.9 was also furious that someone had deliberately taken Qin Ran\u2019s script.Someone scolded the person for being unethical.Wu Yan sneered and said satirically, \u201cShe did not participate in writing the script from beginning to end. She only knows how to play around every day and don\u2019t take things seriously at all. I already said since the beginning that we shouldn\u2019t let her participate.\u201d\u201cEnough, Wu Yan.\u201d A girl frowned. \u201cWho knew that there would be such a nasty student?\u201dWu Yan heard this student\u2019s words and her face turned dark, but she said nothing.She just glanced at Qin Ran and pursed her lips. She clenched the corner of her jacket, her fingers tightening.Qin Ran stood still and greeted the judges first.The Dean raised his hand and asked in an undulated voice, \u201cWhere is your script? Did you lose it?\u201dQin Ran put her hands on the podium and smiled very politely. \u201cTeachers and judges, I have memorized the script in advance, so I didn\u2019t bring my script.\u201dEveryone knew that it was considered a disrespect to this activity and to the judges to have lost her script on such an important occasion.Qin Ran had concealed the fact that she had lost her script, but Lin Siran, Xu Yaoguang, and the other people in class 3.9 were sweating.In this debate contest, it was a development for the social sciences, which was a hot spot in the world and all the universities were inclined to participate. Xu Yaoguang and Lin Siran and the others had researched a lot of information and had included professional vocabulary used from other countries.Most importantly, no one knew better than Lin Siran that Qin Ran didn\u2019t participate in this debate from beginning to end. She had only let Qin Ran read the general script this morning and had only let her read the script once.Qin Ran hasn\u2019t even read the script enough times, so how could she have memorized it?\u201cIt turns out that you have memorized it and did your homework in advance.\u201d The Dean glanced at Qin Ran and said solemnly, \u201cThen begin.\u201dLin Siran\u2019s spine was cold and sweaty, and the people in class 3.9 all had dark expressions on their faces.Qin Yu only stared at Qin Ran, her lips curled up.Qin Ran smiled very lightly. She picked up a piece of chalk and drew a stick figure on the blackboard on the back half. \u201cFrom the perspective of the teenagers, the technology system is roughly divided into three aspects\u2026\u201dHalf of the blackboard showed the slides and the other half was empty.Her analogy was very simple, but her explanation was extremely vivid.Her tone was calm and her speech was organized clearly and without the slightest bit of stuttering.Lin Siran was right. She looked good and was like the most beautiful background even while standing still.Furthermore, when she talked, she wasn\u2019t unbridled like the others but exuded a sort of unprecedented seriousness that made her whole person shine.Some people in the classroom were whispering softly and even looking over subconsciously every few seconds.The expression on the Dean\u2019s face changed from displeasure to surprise, and then from surprise to seriousness.All the classes were sitting at their seats, looking up at Qin Ran dumbfounded. They couldn\u2019t return to their senses for a while, especially Lin Siran, who had personally written most of the script.It had been written by her, so she still had a somewhat vague memory of it. Wasn\u2019t the first paragraph of Qin Ran\u2019s speech the opening statement?Qin Ran had only read through it several times, but she had memorized the whole script already?!Liked it?

In this speech contest, the previous three classes also had scripts, but because there was too much content, nobody really spent much time on it.Qin Ran was unique, however, and even dished out a few English words. Speeches were usually very boring and dry, but she managed to pull everyone\u2019s attention on her.The Dean and the leaders were truly convinced this time. After Qin Ran\u2019s speech, he looked at the timer and then asked Qin Ran several questions. Qin Ran answered them one by one.The leaders couldn\u2019t help but nod their heads and praise this group for working hard. They turned to the Dean to comment on the students of First Middle School.\u201cYes, it\u2019s hard for you to be so decisive.\u201d The Dean nodded in praise. He had always been an unsmiling type but was now looking at Qin Ran with the eyes of an old father. \u201cYou\u2019re called Qin Ran, right? Go down and call your members for the question and answer.\u201dQin Ran got down and saw that Lin Siran and the others were still sitting on their chairs staring at her, stunned.She smiled and didn\u2019t return to her seat. She just leaned on the side and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for question and answer.\u201dLin Siran regained her senses and went on stage with her notebook.Their score ended up being 9.7. If it weren\u2019t because Lin Siran and the others had taken their notebooks with them, they would have gotten more points.After they received their scores, Lin Siran and the others walked down all the way.Qin Ran returned to her seat and leaned slightly on the back of the chair. The students in the classroom looked at her but didn\u2019t dare to talk to her.Only the students from class 3.9 were excited and noisy.Only when Lin Siran and the others went back to sit did the students from the other classes start discussing with them.The following speeches didn\u2019t stand out. Not only did the students sound dull, but the judges were also bored.A total of seventeen classes participated in this speech. The scores after Qin Ran were especially low, and the scores of the following thirteen classes didn\u2019t exceed eight points.The girl next to Qin Yu patted her chest in relief. \u201cFortunately, we were before Qin Ran. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have even gotten eight points.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that they had been lucky.There were two treasures in this school. One of them was Xu Yaoguang, who occupied the first place all year round. The other was Pan Mingyue, who was always second.Xu Yaoguang was in Qin Ran\u2019s class, while Pan Mingyue\u2019s class didn\u2019t participate, so class 3.9 naturally won from the content of their speech.Coupled with the speaker\u2019s performance, Qin Yu was far inferior.If she had really given her speech after Qin Ran, it wasn\u2019t certain if she could even get eight points.Qin Yu was talking to her classmates with a smile on her face, but she felt extremely uncomfortable inside. She glanced over at Qin Ran subconsciously.Xu Yaoguang also glanced sideways at Qin Ran with his eyes narrowed, deep in thought.Qin Yu pursed her lips and felt even more vexed. The people beside her were still talking about Qin Ran presenting without her script, and her smile was slowly fading.**\u201cFirst place, we got first place.\u201d A bunch of people surrounded Qin Ran. \u201cQin Ran, Sister Ran, you\u2019re too impressive. You actually memorized such a long script?!\u201dThey got first place, but when they returned to their classroom, they still had to do self-study.Everyone in the class crowded over.Qin Ran\u2019s lips curled and she sat at her desk smiling casually. She said humbly, \u201cI just read it and remembered it.\u201dQiao Sheng teased her. \u201cIf your memory is so good, you wouldn\u2019t have to come to school!\u201dThe others all agreed, and then someone said that she drew very well.Qin Ran ignored him.Qiao Sheng then thought of something serious and smiled at Qin Ran. Then, he walked to the podium with big strides and sat on a table. He held the blackboard eraser in his hand and knocked it against the table loudly. \u201cQuiet down.\u201dEveryone quieted down.The people who had been surrounding Qin Ran sat down properly and didn\u2019t dare to say a single word.\u201cLin Siran said that the script has always been in the region of class 3.9. I asked a few people and they said that they didn\u2019t see anyone from other classes approaching.\u201d Qiao Sheng was smiling, but his eyes were cold. \u201cThus, I suspect that it was someone from our class, and especially someone from the group. Whoever it is, stand up now.\u201dNobody in the class spoke, and they didn\u2019t even dare to breathe loudly.Qiao Sheng nodded and continued smiling. \u201cFine. I guess that person probably forgot that we still have CCTVs in the classrooms and corridors. I will go to the surveillance room after school.\u201dAfter he said this, everyone in the class exchanged glances and then started discussing in low voices.\u201cQiao Sheng is so handsome!\u201d Wu Yan\u2019s deskmate whispered, suppressing her excitement and squeezing her fists. \u201cBut the person who took the script is really despicable. Who could be so jealous of Qin Ran that she would do such a wicked deed like stealing the script? If Qin Ran hadn\u2019t memorized the script, wouldn\u2019t it have been over?!\u201dWu Yan smiled. \u201cYeah.\u201dHer hands were still squeezed tightly and she was a little distracted.After school at night, Qiao Sheng didn\u2019t go to the basketball court. Instead, he said something to Xu Yaoguang and the two of them went out.\u201cQiao Sheng, wait for me, I want to go too.\u201d A boy who had attended the speech at noon knew that they were going to see the CCTVs. \u201cI want to see who lacks team spirit in our class!\u201dWu Yan\u2019s face turned paler.She glanced at Qin Ran\u2019s direction.Qin Ran didn\u2019t like to leave first after school and always liked taking her time.Someone was hurrying Wu Yan.Wu Yan took her time and distributed the English answer sheets that she had collected yesterday. The English teacher had already marked them, and when she distributed Qin Ran\u2019s paper, she saw that she only got four points.Wu Yan didn\u2019t have ridicule in her eyes this time. She just looked around and saw that a few students were still discussing the questions. She pursed her lips, thought for a while, and left with her friends.**The school\u2019s medical office.Qin Ran was here for sleeping pills. There were several bowls on the table with lids on them to prevent the heat from escaping.\u201cYou performed well today.\u201d Lu Zhaoying laid on the table and grinned at her. \u201cYou probably won\u2019t be scolded.\u201dCheng Juan wasn\u2019t in the school doctor\u2019s office and Lu Zhaoying said that he had gone out.\u201cHey, classmate, are you here to see the doctor?\u201d Lu Zhaoying raised his head when he saw someone outside. It was a female student. \u201cHe\u2019s off work, but I can still help you out.\u201d\u201cNo, I came to find someone.\u201d The girl\u2019s face was red and she turned to Qin Ran. \u201cQin Ran, can you come out? I have something to tell you.\u201dQin Ran was sitting on the chair with chopsticks in her hands. She glanced over at her coldly. \u201cTell me here, I can\u2019t move.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a private matter.\u201d Wu Yan glanced at Lu Zhaoying and pursed her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not good\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any private matters with you.\u201d Qin Ran ignored her.Wu Yan just glanced at Lu Zhaoying, her eyes watery. She was really about to cry and was seeking help from Lu Zhaoying.However, Lu Zhaoying just grinned and stepped back. He touched his ear studs and gestured to it. \u201cI won\u2019t remember what you say, little girl.\u201dHis gentleness towards Wu Yan had disappeared totally.Wu Yan\u2019s face turned pale and she hesitated for a moment. When she saw that Qin Ran and Lu Zhaoying were really ignoring her request, she squeezed her hands and said with a pale face, \u201cQin Ran, the matter at noon\u2026 it\u2026 it was me. But since you already memorized the script, it was still considered a blessing in disguise. Could you tell Qiao Sheng not to bicker about it with me?\u201dLiked it?

Since when did he care about other people\u2019s affairs?Even Qin Yu couldn\u2019t win over Xu Yaoguang\u2019s influence.But how long had it been since Qin Ran was here?Wu Yan was really scared now that Qiao Sheng had intervened.She didn\u2019t dare to tell Qiao Sheng. Although Qiao Sheng appeared mischievous usually, he was actually a young master that everyone was fearful of and he also carried a fierce aura.So she could only come to beg Qin Ran.Qin Ran looked up without a surprised expression on her face.She threw the chopsticks on the table loudly with an expressionless face, but her body was burning in rage.Wu Yan was startled.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Qin Ran cleared her throat.She was about to say something when she smelled a familiar cold fragrance.The tense atmosphere eased for a moment.Qin Ran looked over. Cheng Juan was still wearing a patternless black shirt with a row of transparent buttons. He was holding his phone in his hand and seemed to be talking to someone.A young man followed three steps behind him.He seemed to sense the strange atmosphere in the school doctor\u2019s office and narrowed his eyes. \u201cCall me again later.\u201dHe hung up and didn\u2019t even look at Wu Yan. His eyes fell on Qin Ran and then swept over to Lu Zhaoying.Wu Yan stared at him and was stunned for a moment, unable to react.Lu Zhaoying touched his chin and signaled a little to him. He knew about what had happened to Qin Ran in the afternoon.Wu Yan\u2019s sentence \u201cbut you memorized the script\u201d and \u201cblessing in disguise\u201d made it very obvious.Lu Zhaoying wasn\u2019t stupid.As he kicked out and the chair moved back, he said with a smile that didn\u2019t reach his eyes, \u201cOh, this little girl deliberately stole Qin Ran\u2019s script at noon and wanted to see Qin Ran make a fool of herself in front of the whole school. But she didn\u2019t expect that Qin Ran had not only memorized the whole thing, but she also gave an amazing presentation. Someone wanted to check the CCTVs, so she came over to beg Qin Ran to keep the peace and gloss over the matter.\u201d\u201cAccording to the prosecution\u2019s norm, if revenge and framing caused the victim\u2019s personal rights to be damaged, resulting in mental disorders, etc., then the person who committed the crime has to face imprisonment or detention for up to two years.\u201d Qi Chengjun, who was behind Cheng Juan, looked at Wu Yan, turned, and chuckled. \u201cMs. Qin, do you need a lawyer?\u201d\u201cI really didn\u2019t mean it\u2026\u201d Wu Yan returned to her senses and panicked. She sobbed softly and said, \u201cQin Ran, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t mean it?\u201d Cheng Juan put away his phone and glanced at Wu Yan. His delicate eyebrows were eased and he looked quite gentle. \u201cSo the script ran to you, and then threatened you to throw it away?\u201dHis words were full of mockery.It was quite poisonous.Wu Yan froze and felt the three men stare at her with a strange expression.Her face turned red and then dark.Under Cheng Juan\u2019s mockery, she couldn\u2019t bear it and ran out of the school doctor\u2019s office while choking.**Qi Chengjun looked away and turned to stare at the only girl in the school doctor\u2019s office.He knew that she was probably the Ms. Qin that he had been so curious about.Qin Ran wasn\u2019t curious about him. She didn\u2019t pick up her chopsticks and took the thermos on the table instead.Cheng Juan had wanted to make a call, but he narrowed his eyes as he watched her and forgot about it. He came over and helped her unscrew the lid before pouring her a glass of water.During this period when Qin Ran\u2019s hand was injured, Lin Siran and Cheng Juan both helped her unscrew the lid. She took it, familiar with the movement, and thanked him after taking a sip.Qi Chengjun had wanted to talk to Qin Ran. \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat had he just seen?!He turned again and saw Lu Zhaoying with one foot upon the table. He didn\u2019t seem curious about the scene at all, as if he was used to it.Qi Chengjun was such a calm and sensible person usually.He had always gotten to the point in the courtroom and was extremely sharp with his words.But now, he was stunned for a full minute before he sat down thoughtfully on a chair at the side. Then, he let Cheng Mu pour him a cup of tea.Qin Ran was in a good state today and didn\u2019t have to change her bandage. Instead, she took a bottle of sleeping pills and stuffed it in her pockets before taking her book from the table and returning to her bedroom.From beginning to end, Qi Chengjun didn\u2019t find an opportunity to communicate with her in-depth.And she wasn\u2019t curious about Qi Chengjun at all. She just bowed her head in greeting and continued eating. After eating, she just left with her sleeping pills.She was cold and rather charismatic.\u201cThis little girl\u2026\u201d Qi Chengjun stared at her back as she left. \u201cNo wonder people are jealous of her.\u201dCheng Juan watched as she left and then turned to Cheng Mu. He said in a low voice, \u201cGo and investigate what happened.\u201dCheng Mu responded numbly.Cheng Juan picked up his phone and continued his call.He saw an answer sheet on the floor out of the corner of his eye and picked it up.Qin Ran had dropped it accidentally when she took her book.He had wanted to look at it casually, but when he saw it, Cheng Juan paused for a moment and his grip tightened slightly.Qi Chengjun was sitting opposite him and was quite curious. He leaned over to look at it and saw that the answer sheet received only four points.He laughed first, then turned and seemed to find something wrong.Lu Zhaoying put his hand on the back of the chair and smiled. \u201cThat little girl is good at everything, but her IQ is poor. It\u2019s rare to see her getting a double-digit score, it\u2019s really sad.\u201dLu Zhaoying sighed.Qi Chengjun glanced at him expressionlessly, then pointed to the answer sheet. \u201cAre you sure her IQ is low?\u201dLu Zhaoying was stunned.He got up from his chair and leaned over to look at the answer sheet. He looked for a long while and couldn\u2019t see anything besides the four points. \u201cShe got four points, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dCheng Juan kept the answer sheet, deep in thought.Qi Chengjun glanced at Lu Zhaoying with an inexplicable sense of complication. \u201cNothing.\u201dLu Zhaoying\u2019s lips twitched and he suddenly felt like Qi Chengjun wanted to fight with him.**\u201cIt really is her!\u201d It was getting dark and Qiao Sheng had finally found the video he wanted from the bunch of data.\u201cWu Yan?!\u201d Several boys in the class looked at each other.Xu Yaoguang leaned on one side, his posture elegant and his eyes cold. \u201cCopy it and let\u2019s go.\u201dQiao Sheng had already copied it with his mouse.\u201cBoom\u2014\u201d There was a knock on the door.The boys thought that it was the security guard, but when they turned around, they saw that it was a girl standing there.\u201cQin Yu? You\u2019re here to find Young Master Xu!\u201d Everyone knew her because of her relationship with Xu Yaoguang and Qiao Sheng, and they all knew that she was on good terms with Xu Yaoguang.Qin Yu smiled and turned to Qiao Sheng. \u201cWhat do you intend to do?\u201dQiao Sheng tossed the USB in his hands and smiled. \u201cPublish the video.\u201d\u201cI bumped into Wu Yan on the way here and she\u2019s in a very bad state.\u201d Qin Yu sighed and pursed her lips. \u201cHave you thought about how much pressure Wu Yan would face if you publish it? What if she can\u2019t handle it? What if she takes it too hard?\u201dShe paused and then laughed. \u201cDid my sister make you check the CCTV?\u201dNot anyone could casually check the security department\u2019s surveillance videos. They weren\u2019t policemen. Only Qiao Sheng had this resolution.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He stood by the table and laughed. \u201cAlso, you seem to be very malicious towards your sister? She\u2019s not the kind of person who will seek help from others.\u201d\u201cHow do you know she isn\u2019t that kind of person?\u201d Qin Yu stared at Qiao Sheng and asked. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her like that many times. She doesn\u2019t say anything, but she acts like she had been wronged. Just look at how your whole class is acting sympathetic to her experience. If you publish the video, wouldn\u2019t you make Wu Yan discriminated against? No one can beat her in terms of tactics.\u201dQiao Sheng understood Qin Ran more or less since they had been in contact for a long time.Qin Ran was really cold, and also fought well.Would a person who had even conquered Wei Zihang show weakness to him?Qiao Sheng didn\u2019t even dare to speak too loudly when she was in a bad mood and just casually glanced at him. He also didn\u2019t dare to associate the word \u201cweak\u201d with Qin Ran.He had always felt like Qin Ran was somewhat unpredictable, and he didn\u2019t know what kind of environment had developed such a character like hers.\u201cShe\u2019s my friend, so I definitely know her character. Qin Yu, I don\u2019t need you to lecture me. I\u2019m not stupid and I have my own judgment.\u201d Qiao Sheng sneered and kicked the chair further away. He made a path for himself and then ran a hand through his hair. \u201cYoung Master Xu, I\u2019m going to the cafeteria.\u201dQin Yu let Qiao Sheng\u2019s words sink in.She realized with a sinking heart that Qiao Sheng was on Qin Ran\u2019s side. His attitude was firm and he wouldn\u2019t be shaken. He really had no doubt about Qin Ran.Qin Yu stood there and felt the boys staring at her. She couldn\u2019t help but purse her lips. She didn\u2019t expect Qiao Sheng to really not give her face.Her eyes shook slightly as she said, \u201cQiao Sheng, we\u2019ve known each other for two years, but you\u2019ve only known her for one month. Can it be compared?\u201d\u201cAt least she won\u2019t tell tales in front of me.\u201d Qiao Sheng paused and snorted.Qin Yu gritted her teeth and looked at Qiao Sheng\u2019s back inconceivably.Qin Ran\u2019s tactic was really brilliant.Silently, she had subdued both Lin Jinxuan and Qiao Sheng.Qin Yu sucked in a deep breath and stared after Qiao Sheng. Her eyes flashed a sense of unwillingness, but she quickly covered it up.\u201cYoung Master Xu, Qiao Sheng refuses to listen to my explanation. But you\u2026\u201d Qin Yu sighed, pursed her lips, and said in a low tone.Xu Yaoguang squeezed his phone and looked up at her. \u201cYou want me to plead with Qiao Sheng, eh? But this time, Wu Yan has really gone overboard.\u201d\u201cI know Wu Yan is at fault, but she is my friend. She will really be ruined if I don\u2019t care about her.\u201d Qin Yu sighed and lowered her eyebrows. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make such a big fuss over this matter. You don\u2019t have to be so cruel to Wu Yan when you\u2019re all classmates.\u201dXu Yaoguang stood sideways, his expression cold as always.\u201cWe have known each other for two years and I have never asked anything of you before. But this time, I\u2019m begging you, okay?\u201d Qin Yu tilted her head and smiled gently.**In the cafeteria.Qiao Sheng was having dinner with several of his brothers in class 3.9.\u201cQin Yu didn\u2019t follow?\u201d Qiao Sheng saw that the boys had already packed Xu Yaoguang\u2019s meal and glanced behind him. He put his foot on the table and laughed.\u201cShe went to practice the violin. I have something to talk to you about.\u201d Xu Yaoguang sat down beside Qiao Sheng and picked up the chopsticks beside the bowl.Qiao Sheng nodded and expressed his understanding. \u201cAre you going to watch her practice after talking to me?\u201dAfter spending such a long time with Xu Yaoguang, he also understood him completely. He really liked those who played the violin, and Qin Yu was good at it.Qiao Sheng had often gone with Xu Yaoguang to listen.But now, Qiao Sheng didn\u2019t really have much contact with Qin Yu and rarely visited her.\u201cYeah.\u201d Xu Yaoguang put a piece of vegetable in his mouth and then spoke after swallowing it. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to just lecture Wu Yan privately. Don\u2019t publish the video.\u201dQiao Sheng paused.He slammed his chopsticks on the table and was quite annoyed. He put his hands on the table and asked, \u201cNo way, Young Master Xu. Did Qin Yu beg you?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Xu Yaoguang didn\u2019t deny it.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Qiao Sheng clenched his fists and hit the table.On the opposite side of the table, a spoon on the edge of the table fell to the ground with a shock, making a crisp sound.The students all ate their meals sullenly, not daring to even glance at Qiao Sheng.Xu Yaoguang was still calm and was holding his chopsticks as elegantly as always. \u201cI\u2019ll owe you a favor for this.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Xu, I know you really like Qin Yu, but do you really need to do this for her?\u201d Qiao Sheng was very annoyed and leaned back in his seat.\u201cShe indeed plays well.\u201d Xu Yaoguang remembered the song he had heard downstairs in the art building that day. Later, he had looked through the surveillance cameras, but the violinist had avoided all the cameras.If he wasn\u2019t so logical, he would have almost believed that it wasn\u2019t human.However, he was very clear that Qin Yu wasn\u2019t the one who had played the violin that day.\u201cI\u2019ve heard her play for two years and this is the first time she begged me.\u201d Xu Yaoguang narrowed his eyes and looked over at Qiao Sheng. \u201cSo do you agree?\u201dQiao Sheng clenched his fists and then let go weakly.Then, he sighed. \u201cYoung Master Xu, how could I disobey you?\u201dBut since he had already compromised, Qiao Sheng couldn\u2019t help but vent. \u201cYoung Master Xu, what are you trying to do? Do you really like her that much? Other than not being able to play the violin, Qin Ran is much cuter than her.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s very interesting.\u201d Xu Yaoguang paused and glanced at Qiao Sheng.\u201cPei\u2014\u201d Qiao Sheng laughed. \u201cI can tell. If you told her that you\u2019re Beijing\u2019s\u2026 would she still dangle you around?\u201dYoung Master Xu was actually staying in Yun Cheng\u2019s dormitory and eating in the cafeteria.Xu Yaoguang ignored him.Qiao Sheng didn\u2019t understand. Why was Xu Yaoguang so calm and why did he help Qin Yu so much over a matter that even he could see through?Did he like someone who could play the violin that much?Qiao Sheng was a little angry.What an addiction.Qiao Sheng didn\u2019t go for self-study at night. He felt too ashamed to see Qin Ran and just hid at home. He took out his mobile phone and stared at Qin Ran\u2019s profile for a long time before finally sending a message\u2014[Qin Ran, I have been suppressed. I\u2019m sorry! But I will definitely teach Wu Yan a lesson for you!]**The next day.Qin Yu had already told Wu Yan about the matter.\u201cYu\u2019er, thank you!\u201d Wu Yan didn\u2019t expect that Qin Yu would do so much to help her out. She grasped Qin Yu\u2019s hand gratefully. \u201cYoung Master Xu really does cover for you!\u201dWu Yan had always kept in mind the school\u2019s unwritten rules. If there was someone who she could never mess with, it was Qin Yu.Because Young Master Xu covered for her.\u201cWe\u2019re all friends, how could I have not helped?\u201d Qin Yu smiled. \u201cClass is starting, you should go back.\u201dWu Yan looked at her gratefully.She went back to her class.She went back to her seat and took out her Chinese texts to read. She glanced at Qin Ran\u2019s direction subtly.Qin Ran was leaning against the wall and playing on her phone. Then, she saw the message that Qiao Sheng had sent three hours ago.She narrowed her eyes slightly and turned to Qiao Sheng.Qiao Sheng was lying on the table with his head buried in his arms.After class ended, Wu Yan came over to Qin Ran and whispered, \u201cQin Ran, you didn\u2019t expect it, did you? You don\u2019t even need to open your mouth, did you think\u2026 Without Qiao Sheng covering for you, what are you even in this school?\u201dShe had begged Qin Ran so hard yesterday, and Qin Ran had ignored her. Wu Yan hated her even more.Qin Ran was stunned at Wu Yan\u2019s words.She understood what Qiao Sheng had meant.Qin Ran took out her exercise book and propped her legs up. She then glanced at Wu Yan in a seemingly good mood. \u201cWho told you that I needed to rely on someone?\u201dWu Yan saw that she wasn\u2019t angry and was even smiling.She was involuntarily stunned.This was different from how she had imagined.At this time, Lin Siran, who was sitting with Xia Fei, suddenly pinched her phone and was stunned. Then, she stood up fiercely and shouted at Wu Yan, \u201cWu Yan, why did you throw away Ran Ran\u2019s script?!\u201dLiked it?

FinePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosThe class fell silent.A few of the girls who had participated in the speech said in shock, \u201cLin Siran, did you get it wrong?\u201dWu Yan was also one of the members who had written the script. How could she not know the severity of losing the script during the speech?\u201cLin Siran, don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d Wu Yan\u2019s pupils shrank, but at the thought of what Qin Yu had said to her, she relaxed again. \u201cDid someone drive a wedge between us? Maybe she purposely memorized it herself and then tore the script to gain attention. Otherwise, how could she have memorized such a long script with her mere IQ?\u201dEveryone knew she was talking about Qin Ran.Wu Yan was certain that Qiao Sheng wouldn\u2019t dare to defy Xu Yaoguang\u2019s words.The video would never be released if it were up to the two of them.Wu Yan grew more confident at this thought.What Wu Yan said also made sense. In everyone\u2019s eyes, Qin Ran wasn\u2019t a studious person and it was really puzzling that she had been able to memorize the script.Wu Yan looked unashamed and had even accused Lin Siran and Qin Ran so fiercely.She looked imposing as if she had been framed innocently.\u201cLin Siran, you might have misunderstood.\u201d Someone tried to be the peacemaker. \u201cDon\u2019t get agitated.\u201d\u201cMisunderstanding?\u201d Wu Yan remembered the sense of humiliation she had felt when Qin Ran had ignored her yesterday.She opened her mouth and smiled domineeringly. \u201cLin Siran, did Qin Ran say that to you?\u201dThe whole class looked at Qin Ran subconsciously.Qin Ran still had the exercise book in her hand and was tapping it with her fingers.There was still a casual smile on her face.She leaned against the wall and lifted her chin slightly.Her anger had always been obvious, but now, nobody could tell from her expression.They exchanged glanced and felt a little indecisive about this matter.\u201cYou\u2019re so annoying!\u201d At this moment, Qiao Sheng, who had been lying on the table with his head buried, stood up with a sulky face. He kicked the stool and shouted, \u201cSit down, all of you! Don\u2019t disturb my sleep!\u201dAlthough Qiao Sheng was a rich second-generation heir, he was usually mischievous and didn\u2019t put on airs.But now, he stood up and said in a low voice, making the whole class silent.They didn\u2019t dare to talk.Wu Yan felt suffocated inside. Since Qiao Sheng had agreed not to release the video, he definitely didn\u2019t publicize it.He had only stood up to protect Qin Ran.Why?!Why was it that when she had begged Qin Ran, she could be unreasonable, yet she could gloss over the matter at this time?!\u201cLin Siran, Qin Ran.\u201d Wu Yan felt a burst of anger inside her, be it out of jealousy or something else. \u201cYou have to explain this matter to me today!\u201d\u201cWu Yan!\u201d Qiao Sheng gave her a warning look. If she still refused to settle down, even if there was still Xu Yaoguang to consider, he didn\u2019t intend on staying quiet.Wu Yan bit her lip and felt reluctant, but didn\u2019t dare to say anything.In everyone\u2019s eyes, it felt like Qiao Sheng was deliberately protecting Qin Ran.Only Xia Fei and Lin Siran remained silent. Lin Siran looked at Wu Yan as if she wanted to see how far she could go.\u201cForget it, Wu Yan, don\u2019t bicker anymore\u2026\u201d Wu Yan\u2019s deskmate was on good terms with her and pulled on her arm.Wu Yan\u2019s look of grievance was real\u2026\u201cHa.\u201d Lin Siran suddenly laughed. \u201cWu Yan, if I didn\u2019t know the truth, I would really have thought that you had been wronged after seeing your expression.\u201dWu Yan had already reached her seat.At this, she exploded like a pierced balloon. \u201cLin Siran, what do you mean? Fine, I didn\u2019t want to bicker with you at first, but if you slander me again and again because of what Qin Ran told you\u2026\u201dThe rest of them could tell that Wu Yan was very angry.Wu Yan\u2019s deskmate immediately pulled Wu Yan and said softly, \u201cThis might be a misunderstanding and might have nothing to do with you and Qin Ran. Drop it.\u201dWu Yan\u2019s eyes were red with anger and she looked like she wanted to kill Qin Ran. Everyone really thought she had been wronged deeply.A few students even wanted to comfort her.It was as if she was the biggest victim here.Lin Siran looked at the silent Qin Ran and felt uncomfortable.Before self-study, Lin Siran had gone to Xia Fei to discuss a math question.The math teacher had discussed it in class and Lin Siran had understood it. In class, Qin Ran circled a few questions and said that she didn\u2019t understand, so Lin Siran had explained it to her.Lin Siran also only understood half of it. Although she knew that Qin Ran wasn\u2019t serious in studying, she didn\u2019t want to teach her half-heartedly either.So, she had gone to find Xia Fei to discuss the problem and had wanted to really understand the question from the topic to the formula to the answer.After the two of them discussed the problem, Lin Siran had sorted out her thoughts by writing it down.Xia Fei had let her think by herself. She then picked her phone and continued sliding on it.When Lin Siran finished thinking about the problem, she found that Xia Fei\u2019s expression was strange, so she glanced over at her phone subconsciously.She saw a surveillance video.In the corridor, there was an image of a girl tearing a piece of paper. She was facing to the side and the camera wasn\u2019t very clear, but it was obvious that the girl was Wu Yan.Lin Siran had experienced the nervousness of having lost her script first-hand.Under that sort of circumstance, the script had been lost in front of Qin Ran. If Qin Ran hadn\u2019t had such a good memory, their class would definitely have lost face in front of the city leaders and the TV stations.This meant that their efforts over several days had been in vain, and the source of all this would have been projected onto Qin Ran.So class 3.9 had acted collectively after knowing that the script had been thrown away. They had expressed anger towards the person who had done this and had hated the same enemy.After knowing that this had been done by Wu Yan, Lin Siran felt frustrated and angry.What made Lin Siran feel most unexpected was that even after she had exposed her, Wu Yan still felt aggrieved.Wu Yan\u2019s deskmate glanced at Lin Siran at this moment. \u201cLin Siran, you should drop it too\u2026\u201dBecause of Wu Yan\u2019s performance, the people in the class all felt like Lin Siran might be a little unreasonable.\u201cYou want to bicker over it? Fine.\u201d Lin Siran took Xia Fei\u2019s phone and held it up. She wasn\u2019t smiling and didn\u2019t even bother explaining, just enlarged the screen and pushed the phone into Wu Yan\u2019s hands. She said in a soft voice, \u201cLook at it.\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She originally wanted to continue ridiculing her, but before her words reached her mouth, her face suddenly froze.Her expression changed and she wanted to delete the video.Lin Siran stared at her. \u201cThis video is on the forum.\u201dIt couldn\u2019t be deleted.The other students in the class quickly took out their mobile phones and flipped to the school\u2019s forum. The post was on the first page and was very easy to see.Wu Yan looked around subconsciously and her deskmate, who had wanted to speak up for her, took a step back while holding her phone, looking at her with precaution.In the video, Wu Yan\u2019s side profile was easy to recognize.The clarity wasn\u2019t in the blu-ray version, but the expression on her face could be seen clearly. She tore a few pieces of paper and threw the USB flash drive into the trash can. Then, she poured water on it, her side face smiling sinisterly and strangely.Wu Yan\u2019s appearance made everyone in class 3.9 gasp and become completely stunned!She had said that Qin Ran had put on a play all by herself, that Qin Ran had deliberately framed her, but now, it seemed like she was talking about herself!This surveillance camera showed who was innocent and who the culprit was in a glance!Wu Yan had looked wronged just now, so some people really doubted that Qin Ran had really put on a play by herself, and many also thought that Lin Siran had been making trouble.But now it was extremely ironic.They had defended the true culprit, Wu Yan. Qin Ran had saved the face of class 3.9 and had maintained their reputation, only to be spurned and suspected by them. They themselves even felt disappointed for Qin Ran.And how did Wu Yan put on a face of innocence and anger and push all the blame onto Qin Ran?\u201cQin Ran, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Wu Yan\u2019s deskmate bowed to Qin Ran, her face full of guilt.Then she went back to her seat, ignored Wu Yan, and moved her books to the space between their desks.She was already so scheming at this young age. If it hadn\u2019t been for the surveillance camera, then wouldn\u2019t Qin Ran have had no chance of dispute?The other students who had talked before also came up to apologize.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Qin Ran\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Wu Yan\u2019s hands trembled and her mind was blank. She was simply dumbfounded.She felt like her mind had stopped working.What had she said all self-righteously just now?She had said that she originally didn\u2019t intend on bickering over the matter with Qin Ran, and the other students had believed her subconsciously because of this sentence. But now, it was simply a joke from beginning to end!She didn\u2019t even dare to look at the people she had a good relationship with before, because they were all looking at her with disgusted expressions.She had thought that nobody else except Qiao Sheng would be able to get the surveillance videos.She had thought that everything was under her control.But this surveillance video had completely exposed her face\u2026\u201cLying bitch, you\u2019re really disgustingly fake. You were the one who did it, how could you still pretend to have been framed and act all innocent and angry?!\u201d Someone muttered in a low voice.\u201cShe\u2019s simply shameless. Isn\u2019t she just jealous that Qiao Sheng and Qin Ran are on good terms?\u201d The student sitting behind Wu Yan moved her table backward and scolded.\u201c\u2026\u201dFacing the obvious rejection and accusation of her classmates, Wu Yan bowed her head and ran out of the back door, stumbling on her way.**Some people were still apologizing to Lin Siran. She wasn\u2019t in a good mood, so she just shook her head and went back to her seat.She turned around and asked softly, \u201cRan Ran, are you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d Qin Ran lowered her eyes and glanced at the video on her phone. She had hacked into the school\u2019s surveillance office yesterday night.She had just wanted to take it out without the intention of using it.She lowered her head slightly and flipped to the school forum. The person who posted it had the ID \u201cleifeng\u201d.She couldn\u2019t find any clues.\u201cI didn\u2019t even do anything.\u201d Lin Siran was stunned and didn\u2019t know why Qin Ran had said this. \u201cYou even gave me Yan Xi\u2019s albums. Do you know\u2026\u201d\u201cI only had to use my mouth to get the albums.\u201d Qin Ran put down her phone and supported her chin with her cold fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t compare to you\u2026\u201dLin Siran looked up at her.Qin Ran smiled and didn\u2019t say more.After a while, she turned and looked at Lin Siran.**In less than half a day, class 3.9 added more details to the story and spread it on the forum, full of righteous indignation.It spread throughout the whole school.The students in Mu Ying\u2019s class also discussed this matter all afternoon. They talked about how Qin Ran had reversed the situation after the script had been torn, and also talked about Wu Yan\u2026In the eyes of these students, Qin Ran became even more of a mysterious figure than Xu Yaoguang.\u201cWhat a big deal, Qin Ran is Mu Ying\u2019s cousin!\u201d Li Yuhan linked arms with Mu Ying. \u201cCan you take us to your cousin after school?\u201dAs Mu Ying raised her head, the people in class she was on good terms with were all looking at her with expectation and amazement.Her family background wasn\u2019t good and her studies weren\u2019t as good as Mu Nan\u2019s. This was the first time so much attention was focused on her.Mu Ying promised them to wait outside Qin Ran\u2019s classroom.After school at night.Qin Ran left later than the others as usual.As soon as Mu Ying saw her, her eyes lit up and she waved but didn\u2019t have the chance to speak.Then, she saw that not far away, an old man got out of a Mercedes-Benz and stopped in front of Qin Ran.Liked it?

He pointed to the Mercedes-Benz not far away. \u201cOur Madam wants to see you.\u201dHe nodded slightly, his tone neither humble nor overbearing.Qin Ran frowned and stood at the side. She was expressionless and didn\u2019t even raise her head. \u201cMake way.\u201dShe didn\u2019t ask about the car nor who he was. She didn\u2019t even ask who his Madam was. This was obviously beyond the expectations of the old man. Qin Ran\u2019s answer wasn\u2019t something he had expected.\u201cMadam Feng wants to see you, please come with me.\u201d The old man blocked her path again and said in a heavier tone.Qin Ran finally looked up. She turned the phone in her left hand and it traced a curvature in the air. Then, she clenched it in her fists and said with cold and dry eyes, \u201cMake way.\u201dMaybe it was because nobody had ever spoken to him like that, but the old man was frozen in place now.Qin Ran bypassed him and walked forward.Within a few steps, she saw Mu Ying.Qin Ran was obviously in a bad mood. Mu Ying rarely saw her act this coldly.\u201cCousin,\u201d she called softly.\u201cYeah.\u201d Qin Ran cleared her throat and narrowed her eyes slightly. Her apricot eyes were still cold when she looked up. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Mu Ying glanced at the car not far away and wanted to ask who it was, but she didn\u2019t dare to say more about it when she saw Qin Ran\u2019s expression. So, she just said, \u201cMother heard that your hand was injured, so she asked me to invite you over on Saturday.\u201d\u201cHow did she know\u2026\u201d Qin Ran clenched her phone and thought for a while before replying, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll go.\u201d\u201cSorry, my cousin has always had a bad temper\u2026\u201d Mu Ying explained to her classmates with her head lowered when Qin Ran had left.\u201cWow, her reputation is really well-deserved. She comes with air-conditioning within a meter!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d\u201cMu Ying, I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s your cousin!\u201d\u201cWho was that old man that got off the car? He looks so good!\u201dBefore Mu Ying could open her mouth to explain, the group of people around her had exploded in suppressed, excited voices, and didn\u2019t seem to have just been ignored.Mu Ying, who still wanted to explain further, stood in a daze for a long time. She stared in the direction of Qin Ran and felt complicated. \u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d**When Qin Ran got to the school doctor\u2019s office, Lu Zhaoying was holding his phone and laughing foolishly.He waved when he saw Qin Ran.Qi Chengjun had always been busy and should have left after the case, but he had stayed the whole day in the school doctor\u2019s office and was still holding Qin Ran\u2019s answer sheet.\u201cQin\u2026\u201dHe opened his mouth, but before he could say more, Cheng Juan walked over from the mannequin, pulled out the answer sheet from his hand, and handed it to Qin Ran.Qin Ran glanced at it. It was the answer sheet she had copied.She paused.Cheng Juan stared at her, then said expressionlessly, \u201cYou dropped this here accidentally. I\u2019ve put it away till now.\u201dQin Ran nodded and said politely, \u201cThank you.\u201dQi Chengjun was still staring at Qin Ran.Lu Zhaoying didn\u2019t see it, but he and Cheng Juan had both seen that in this little girl\u2019s seemingly cluttered English answer sheet with a low score, the abcd options actually contained a five letter Morse code.Morse codes were made by using long and short dots that represented English letters, numbers, and commonly used symbols.Qin Ran\u2019s five letter Morse code was in order.It seemed to be organized in the molecular formula of the tungstic acid.At first, he had wondered if this molecular formula meant anything?But after Cheng Juan\u2019s reminder, he discovered that the molecular weight of the tungstic acid\u2019s molecular formula was 250. This little girl was scolding people through the answer sheet!1He didn\u2019t know what kind of circumstance she had been in while doing up the answer sheet.Qi Chengjun sat on the sofa and pressed his finger against his lips as he watched Cheng Juan change Qin Ran\u2019s bandage.At this time, the school doctor\u2019s office door was closed.Someone knocked against the door twice, anxious and loud.Lu Zhaoying\u2019s legs were propped on the table and he said absent-mindedly, \u201cCome in.\u201dThe door was banged open.Was it so urgent?Lu Zhaoying squinted and looked up. At one glance, he saw Principal Xu, who was still wearing a suit and holding a briefcase after returning from a business trip.He quickly lowered his legs and stood up. \u201cElder Xu, are you here to find Qi Chengjun?\u201dQi Chengjun hadn\u2019t noticed the person at the door. He had learned psychology before and was trying to decipher Qin Ran\u2019s psychological thoughts.Before he could analyze it, he heard Lu Zhaoying\u2019s voice.Qi Chengjun was stunned for a moment, then he stood up immediately and looked at Principal Xu nervously. \u201cElder\u2026\u201dEveryone in the school doctor\u2019s office subconsciously felt that Elder Xu had rushed here to see Qi Chengjun.However, Principal Xu didn\u2019t even give Qi Chengjun a single glance. He went directly to Qin Ran and Cheng Juan.Cheng Juan had just opened the gauze and was cleaning the edges with an alcohol wipe.A few days had passed and the wound on her palm had begun to heal. Still a little red and swollen and purplish, it still had traces of the stitches and looked even more terrible than before.Principal Xu\u2019s expression changed almost instantly. \u201cHow did this happen to your hand?\u201d\u201cPrincipal Xu?\u201d Qin Ran stared at him in surprise. Then, she looked at her hand and smiled casually. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cFine?! Doctor, her hand\u2026\u201d Principal Xu\u2019s face was dark. He ignored her and looked up to find that the person who had bandaged her hand was Cheng Juan.He was shocked for a moment before he said, \u201cWith you around, her hand should be fine.\u201dPrincipal Xu heaved a sigh of relief.However, he couldn\u2019t help but give Cheng Juan another glance. This person only received one operation per month and it was already a routine. Then, this\u2026He was hesitating when he finally noticed the school doctor\u2019s office surroundings.He was shocked and surprised to see Qi Chengjun standing there. \u201cYou\u2019re in Yun Cheng too?\u201dQi Chengjun: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe laughed and opened his mouth to say something, only to see that Principal Xu had turned to Qin Ran again.\u201cSay, what happened? You\u2019re already so big, how could you have injured your hand like this?!\u201d Principal Xu\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t good. He didn\u2019t look at Qin Ran\u2019s hand and only stared at her. \u201cTell me, what happened to your right hand? Who the hell had the guts to touch your right hand?!

He paused before continuing, \u201cDoes he know your situation?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I won\u2019t be crippled.\u201d Qin Ran supported her chin with her other hand and pressed her fingertips against her lips.Principal Xu had always been calm and elegant. He was rational and restrained. This was the first time Cheng Juan and the others had heard him swear.Cheng Juan carefully sprayed powder on Qin Ran\u2019s wound, glancing up at Principal Xu at the same time.He was very quiet.But Lu Zhaoying wasn\u2019t as calm. He looked at Qin Ran in shock, then at Principal Xu. These two people not only had a huge gap in terms of age but also in their identity.The Xu family in Beijing couldn\u2019t compete with the top three families, but Elder Xu\u2019s position in Beijing was extremely important. Hence, the Xu family had always been ranked right behind them.Many people wanted to make friends with the Xu family and get close to Elder Xu.He didn\u2019t expect Principal Xu to not only know Qin Ran but to be so close to her?!He turned and saw that Qi Chengjun, who had been stunned from beginning to end, was now completely calm. Lu Zhaoying couldn\u2019t help but ask him.\u201cIs this very strange?\u201d Qi Chengjun raised his eyebrows slightly and looked away from Qin Ran before saying slowly, \u201cI can even accept Master Juan\u2019s weird behaviors, much less Principal Xu\u2019s.\u201dNo wonder he was a lawyer, he hit the nail on the head.Lu Zhaoying was stunned for a moment. He reacted and felt like this really did seem to be the case.But why was Principal Xu behaving like this? Was it because she looked good and he liked looking at her?Principal Xu said something to Qin Ran and Cheng Juan before leaving.The workers from the hotel had already sent food over. Tonight\u2019s dinner was crayfish.Qin Ran had been looking forward to it until she saw a layer of garlic on the crayfish\u2019s body. \u201c\u2026\u201dLu Zhaoying and Qi Chengjun each opened a bottle of beer and drank it. Qi Chengjun had also brought a bottle of wine. Qin Ran poked a straw in, but it was taken away by Cheng Juan before she could even take a sip.\u201cToday\u2019s main dish is crayfish.\u201d He put milk in front of her and pointed to the table.Qin Ran poked at the rice with her chopsticks and looked up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s only nice if it\u2019s spicy.\u201dCheng Juan glanced at her and peeled a shrimp. He wasn\u2019t very skilled at it, but he was very meticulous. He was a doctor, after all. He trimmed the shells very neatly.He put the plump shrimp into her bowl, then took a piece of tissue paper and wiped his slender fingers. \u201cTry it.\u201dQi Chengjun paused and marveled at this scene.\u201cLook, just like that.\u201d He lowered his head slightly and whispered to Lu Zhaoying.Compared to this, how big of a deal was Principal Xu\u2019s reaction?Could you find someone in Beijing who Master Juan bowed his head to?Lu Zhaoying wasn\u2019t surprised and just asked Qin Ran casually, \u201cQin Ran, how do you know Principal Xu?\u201d\u201cPrincipal Xu came to our town to help the poor before. I came to First Middle School because of his recommendation.\u201d Qin Ran ate the crayfish in small bites.Her expression wasn\u2019t strange at all.Lu Zhaoying scratched his head and felt like this was too exaggerated. He opened his mouth and wanted to ask something, but Cheng Juan glanced at him and he immediately sealed his mouth.Cheng Juan lowered his head. His eyes were clear, but his heart wasn\u2019t as calm as he seemed.Who on earth was this girl in front of him?She was involved in the big case 712, and half of the information had even been sealed off; Feng Loucheng had found 129 for her, and even the usually calm Principal Xu was protecting her. Anybody with logical thoughts would be surprised\u2026She was quite a mysterious person\u2026**At the same time.In an alley in the suburbs.\u201cWu Yan, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t expect Qiao Sheng to disobey Young Master Xu and harm you\u2026\u201d Qin Yu pushed the door and entered Wu Yan\u2019s room.Wu Yan was sitting on her bed in a daze. Hearing this, she responded slowly, \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Qiao Sheng didn\u2019t do this.\u201dHer voice was hoarse and her eyes drooped down.She threw aside her white phone; the screen was still showing the school forum.Almost every post on the school forum was discussing and condemning her. Wu Yan was too afraid to even look at it now.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t him, who else could have obtained the video?\u201d Qin Yu looked at Wu Yan in surprise.\u201cWho else?\u2026\u201d Wu Yan laughed a little strangely and seemed to have remembered something. But before she spoke, she swallowed her words and changed the topic stiffly. \u201cMy parents want me to change schools next semester.\u201dQin Yu\u2019s lips curled slightly, but she restrained it in the next moment. \u201cCome and find me if you have anything. I will help in whatever ways I can.\u201dWu Yan nodded indiscriminately and waited for Qin Yu to leave.Then, she picked up her phone and opened her photo album with her finger. At one glance, she found the picture she was searching for.She then clenched her fingers, cold and sinister. Her eyes were completely mad.**The next day was Saturday.Qin Ran didn\u2019t go to the hospital. Instead, she called Chen Shulan and went to Ning Wei\u2019s house at noon.Ning Wei was on leave today.When Qin Ran arrived, the aroma of the food in the kitchen was still lingering with Ning Wei busy inside.\u201cCousin, you\u2019re here.\u201d Mu Ying opened the door and let Qin Ran in.When Qin Ran entered, she saw that Qin Yu and Ning Qing were both sitting on the sofa in the hall.Ever since their last argument, Ning Qing had been lectured by Chen Shulan again. This was the first time she had seen Qin Ran since and she picked up the tea on the table awkwardly.\u201cRan Ran, your hand\u2026\u201dShe glanced at Qin Ran\u2019s right hand and opened her mouth at the thought of what Chen Shulan had said. She wanted to ask about her right hand; it had indeed been bothering her all this while.However, before she could speak, Qin Ran turned and walked into the kitchen to see Ning Wei.Ning Qing\u2019s hand stiffened and she picked up the tea that Mu Ying had poured for her to cover up her embarrassment.\u201cSecond cousin, your tea.\u201d Mu Ying handed another cup to Qin Yu.Qin Yu looked at the teacup and took it, but didn\u2019t drink it and just put it on the table. She didn\u2019t know how many people had drunk from this cup before, and Ning Wei\u2019s house didn\u2019t even have disinfectant.Mu Ying didn\u2019t go into the kitchen to help Ning Wei and Qin Ran. She sat beside Qin Yu and looked at her and smiled very obediently. \u201cYour watch is really beautiful.\u201dShe saw that Qin Yu was on the school forum and couldn\u2019t help but pick up her phone. \u201cSecond cousin, why are you in the school forum?\u201dShe was used to entering the page.She flipped through it casually and saw that a post with almost one thousand replies had the word \u201ccampus belle\u201d on it. She knew that it was talking about Qin Ran and so couldn\u2019t help but click in.She saw the town plan at one glance and the half-covered title behind it. Her eyes widened and her fingers froze in disbelief.Qin Yu kept her phone at this time and turned over, asking in curiosity, \u201cMu Ying, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dNing Qing also looked over.Liked it?

Ning Wei put the lid on the pot and saw Qin Ran\u2019s heavily bandaged hand when she turned her head.\u201cStay there and don\u2019t touch the water.\u201d Ning Wei waved and wanted her to leave.Qin Ran thought about it and threw the vegetables in her hand back into the bowl of water. However, she didn\u2019t leave and just leaned against the door while squinting her eyes.Ning Wei thought about Ning Qing\u2019s relationship with Qin Ran and sighed inside, but didn\u2019t force her to go out.\u201cYou found someone to install the air conditioner here, right? It\u2019s not easy for you to earn money, don\u2019t spend it on my house. Although I don\u2019t have many skills, I can still feed my family.\u201d Ning Wei nagged and continued talking. \u201cAlso, don\u2019t buy clothes for Mu Nan anymore.\u201dThe last time in school, the bag that Qin Ran had asked Mu Nan to bring back was full of new clothes for him.Qin Ran stared at the smoky pot and responded absent-mindedly.Ning Wei knew her temper. Although she had responded, she would probably still buy it.Several main dishes were ready and the soup had been boiling since morning.Ning Wei took the soup out first and Qin Ran followed with a few dishes.The atmosphere in the narrow living room wasn\u2019t very good.Ning Qing stared at the mobile phone in her hand and lowered her eyebrows. She said nothing while Qin Yu sat beside her, looking worried.Mu Ying clenched her skirt in her hands, fidgeting.Ning Wei put the pot on the table and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s with your expressions?\u201dNing Qing looked up and slammed the phone on the table.She didn\u2019t look at Ning Wei. Her eyes fell on Qin Ran and her voice trembled as she asked, \u201cTell me honestly, where did the money you paid for your grandma\u2019s ward last time come from?\u201dQin Ran bent down and put the bowl on the table. Then, she dragged a chair away and sat down at the dining table before answering impatiently, \u201cIt\u2019s my own.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s this?\u201d Ning Qing got up from the sofa, picked up the cell phone, and walked over to Qin Ran. She enlarged the picture and showed it to her.Qin Ran poured a glass of water for herself and leaned against the chair.It was a picture with a dark background. There were street lights and it was quite blurry, but her face could still be seen clearly in the picture. The person with his back to her couldn\u2019t be seen clearly, but he didn\u2019t look young.There was a Mercedes at the side.This photograph was too suggestive.Qin Ran\u2019s hand paused and she tilted her head. She looked at it for a moment and chuckled.\u201cDid he give you money?\u201d Ning Qing\u2019s head was about to explode. \u201cYou never used the money I gave you, and now\u2026 what do you mean by this? Are you deliberately provoking me and taking revenge on me?\u201dQin Ran understood what Ning Qing was saying.She looked up at Ning Qing slowly, her eyes indifferent.Ning Wei also knew that something was wrong. She grabbed Ning Qing\u2019s hand quickly. \u201cSister, don\u2019t be impulsive. Talk nicely to her first, Ran Ran isn\u2019t a disobedient child.\u201dSince she had misunderstood her several times, Ning Qing eased her emotions and looked at Qin Ran. \u201cTell me, who is this person in the photo? Why did you meet him at such a late timing?\u201dQin Ran poured herself a bowl of soup and said casually, \u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201dNing Qing\u2019s head hurt at such an ambiguous answer and didn\u2019t even want to stay further in the Mu family\u2019s house.She grabbed her bag and rushed off.\u201cSister, you\u2026 sigh.\u201d Qin Yu looked at Qin Ran and hesitated. Then, she sighed and chased Ning Qing. \u201cMother, wait for me!\u201dNing Wei still didn\u2019t know what happened.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Qin Ran said calmly.She finished her soup and ate another bowl of rice. After playing a game with Mu Ying, she left the house and returned to school.**Today was Saturday, and everyone else except those staying on campus was at home.Those who stayed on campus were either studying or hanging out.There weren\u2019t many people on the road.The students from class 3.9 were still discussing. Some people were gesturing to Qin Ran, their motions filled with indignation.\u201cRan Ran, why didn\u2019t you answer my call?\u201d Lin Siran dragged Qin Ran over and asked in a suppressed voice. \u201cDid you see the school forum?\u201dLin Siran picked her phone and opened the school forum to show Qin Ran\u2014\u201cFemale students nowadays can really do anything for money.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this girl the freshman in that class?\u201d\u201cNo wonder I saw her using luxury goods even though she has a bad family background.\u201d\u201cIs this man old enough to be her dad?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The replies under the post were increasingly intensive.The comments on the photo were still increasing constantly.Qin Ran looked at it casually.At this time, someone knocked on class 3.9\u2019s door and the person at the door stood up straight. \u201cQin Ran, come out.\u201dIt was a teacher.Qin Ran returned the phone to Lin Siran and followed after the teacher.The people in the class stared at her and discussed the matter in low voices when she was gone.Over here.Qin Ran followed the teacher to the office where several teachers were sitting.\u201cThis is the case, student Qin.\u201d The Dean recognized Qin Ran from the speech contest last time and had been very impressed by her, so his tone was still quite good. \u201cSomeone has reported you anonymously for having unchecked behavior. Do you have an explanation in regard to this?\u201d\u201cExplanation?\u201d A female teacher glanced at Qin Ran in disgust. \u201cStudents nowadays can do anything\u2026\u201dA few teachers stopped her.The Dean glanced at her and then turned his attention to Qin Ran, pondering. \u201cQin Ran, this matter has already spread onto Weibo. It has a bad influence on our school\u2019s reputation and also on you. Can you tell me if you know the person in the picture? Did someone photoshop this, or are you really intimate with him?\u201dIf they didn\u2019t know each other, it would be much easier to settle this issue.Qin Ran raised her eyebrows slightly and then put down her mobile phone. She looked away lazily and chuckled. \u201cI know him.\u201dThe Dean was stunned.The female teacher looked at Qin Ran and sneered.But before she could talk, Qin Ran continued in a calm, unhurried voice, \u201cHe\u2019s Feng Loucheng.\u201dLiked it?

Can you contact him now? Why did you have to meet him at night\u2026\u201dBefore the female teacher finished speaking, the Dean stood up. \u201cAre you talking about the Feng Loucheng I know?\u201d\u201cWho else?\u201d Qin Ran nodded. Her voice undulated but was very polite.\u201cI got it.\u201d The Dean looked at Qin Ran for a moment and his expression changed. \u201cI will handle this matter, you can go back to class.\u201d\u201cDean, how can you just let her go?\u201d The female teacher didn\u2019t understand and yet didn\u2019t dare to be unbridled in front of the Dean.But her tone was obviously not good.The Dean looked at Qin Ran\u2019s back and was thoughtful. When he heard the female teacher, he narrowed his eyes and said softly, \u201cWhat did you plan to do to her if she stayed?\u201d\u201cYou must call her parents and report her!\u201d The female teacher frowned. \u201cWon\u2019t this affect our reputation?\u201d\u201cReport her?\u201d The Dean laughed and then nodded. \u201cShould we report Feng Loucheng as well?\u201d\u201cHe must be scum in society.\u201d The female teacher thought of the post and frowned. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we criticize him?\u201d\u201cWe can.\u201d The Dean tidied his clothes and smiled slightly. \u201cYou can go ahead and criticize him. You can hang our mayor on the school forum and criticize him by name. Go ahead, you\u2019re impressive.\u201dAfter he spoke, the Dean ignored her.He turned over and talked to another male teacher. \u201cYou can deal with this matter. The picture has just been released and shouldn\u2019t have too big an impact. Qin Ran is young and can\u2019t be affected. Delete all the posts for me.\u201dThe Dean was old and wasn\u2019t the kind of person who didn\u2019t have foresight. From Qin Ran\u2019s unbridled and generous actions, he didn\u2019t feel like she would do something of that sort.Furthermore, the other party was the mayor, so there was no way Qin Ran would joke about it.The male leader responded and quickly contacted the others with his phone.The Dean nodded and left the office.The female teacher stayed where she was looking at the male teacher a little dumbfounded. \u201cWhat did the Dean say? The mayor?\u201d\u201cLook him up on the official website or turn on the local news at night and you might hear or see him.\u201d The male teacher finished his phone call and smiled at her. \u201cThe mayor of this city should be easy to find.\u201dThe female teacher opened her mouth.The name Feng Loucheng was well-known in politics.But she was a little citizen living her life as each day went by, so where would she have the time to pay attention to the current affairs?Why would she pay attention to who the mayor of the city was and what his name was?Furthermore, the mayor was a person too far away from their daily lives. She usually had no contact with him at all and had never thought of paying attention to it.She didn\u2019t know that the mayor\u2019s name was Feng Loucheng.What had she wanted to do just now? Criticize Qin Ran and Feng Loucheng?The male teacher was still talking to a group of people who managed the school forum, but the female teacher had no intention of listening. She sat on a chair and stayed there indifferently.**In the evening, Qin Ran went to the school doctor\u2019s office.Recently, Qi Chengjun had been staying at the school doctor\u2019s office and Cheng Juan seemed quite busy.Qin Ran changed her bandage and saw them discussing something in low voices. Cheng Mu had lowered his voice deliberately so that she couldn\u2019t hear.Qin Ran sat in the corner and played with a computer that they seldom used.\u201cQin Ran, do you want water?\u201d Lu Zhaoying asked her with a cup on the table.Qin Ran squinted and shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lu Zhaoying brought the glass of water over curiously.Qin Ran was biting a lollipop in her mouth while looking at the ID that had just appeared on the computer.She clicked something, causing the screen to change instantly to a game page, and smiled slightly. \u201cI\u2019m gaming.\u201dLu Zhaoying also smiled. \u201cYou also play Kyushu Tour? Did you watch the competition?\u201dQin Ran bit into her lollipop and nodded vaguely.\u201cThen you must know of Yang Fei from the group, ost. He\u2019s very powerful.\u201d Lu Zhaoying chuckled. \u201cDidn\u2019t he just win the championship? There\u2019s a playoff game in Yun Cheng next month and the ticket can\u2019t be bought by most people. But I have a friend who knows them, so I can bring you to meet him next time.\u201dHe looked like he was doing her a big favor.Qin Ran glanced at him and was silent for a while. \u201c\u2026 Oh.\u201dLu Zhaoying touched his chin, wondering why this girl was so different from the other female fans of Yang Fei.Kyushu Tour traveled all over the world and Yang Fei was the first player from China who had made a name for himself abroad. The young boy was extremely enthusiastic and wasn\u2019t just popular with Kyushu Tour fans in the country but also had his fan club abroad.In the past two years, Kyushu Tour had entered a new era known as the \u201cSun God\u201d.Even Lu Zhaoying liked it very much and would often use his privileges to get tickets to watch.But Qin Ran\u2026 was she a fake fan?**Because the post on the school forum had appeared inexplicably, its disappearance was also inexplicable.The person who had posted it kept reposting it, only for it to be deleted.Since it was the school holidays, not many people knew about it.On Monday morning, Qin Ran got up from her bed and saw a pot of green plants beside it.She glanced over at Lin Siran\u2019s bed\u2014she had already gotten up. Qin Ran squinted and went to wash her face before heading to class.In the afternoon, Qin Yu went to the student union.The school forum was managed by the student union.\u201cSenior.\u201d Everyone in the student council knew Qin Yu and greeted her very politely.Qin Yu nodded and went to the technical department. After chatting for a while, she asked casually, \u201cI have a friend whose posts have been deleted without reason, do you know what happened?\u201dThe school forum was actually free-range.The person-in-charge heard this and probably knew what Qin Yu was talking about. \u201cAre you talking about that post?\u201dHe lowered his voice.Qin Yu nodded. Her eyes flickered as she lowered her voice and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the inside story? Why was it suddenly deleted? Is it because it affected the school badly?\u201d\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t bother about this.\u201d The person-in-charge looked mysterious.\u201cWhy?\u201dHe sighed and said softly, \u201cDo you know who is involved in this?\u201dQin Yu didn\u2019t really care and didn\u2019t know who Qin Ran was associated with, but she still asked, \u201cWho?\u201d\u201cMayor Feng.\u201dLiked it?

Her only association was with Madam Feng. Although Feng Ci was Lin Jinxuan\u2019s friend, even Qin Yu had never had the chance to speak much to him.Thus, Qin Yu had only seen Mayor Feng on the television.Not only her, but even the Lin family didn\u2019t have a close relationship with the Feng family.\u201cIt\u2019s an insider story. You must keep this matter confidential and can\u2019t tell anyone else,\u201d the boy said, afraid of the consequences. \u201cThe teacher told me personally.\u201dQin Yu pursed her lips and lowered her eyebrows. After a long while, she looked up and smiled. \u201cHow do you know if this is true?\u201dShe had never heard Qin Ran or Chen Shulan say that they knew Feng Loucheng. Qin Yu didn\u2019t really believe it. If Qin Ran really knew Feng Loucheng, wouldn\u2019t she tell Ning Qing and the others?Why wouldn\u2019t she tell anyone?\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d The boy shook his head and pursed his lips again, deep in thought. \u201cNobody would make a joke with this, right?\u201dQin Yu didn\u2019t say anything but was a little distracted.In the end, she tucked her hair behind her ears and smiled. \u201cMaybe.\u201dThis story was big but didn\u2019t have much impact.In fact, when the picture had first come out, many people had indeed followed the trend, but then many people on the school forum had spontaneously come forward to defend Qin Ran.The impact of the post on the school forum was actually not so big, but now that it was deleted, it was even more useless.Weibo probably had the largest traffic on the Internet.Qin Yu thought about it and absent-mindedly opened Wu Yan\u2019s chat.**On Monday afternoon after class, Qin Ran sat on her seat and slowly kept her books.Lin Siran packed her things and went to the cafeteria after informing her.Qin Ran had always been slow, and the people in the classroom all left quickly.\u201cQin Ran, someone is waiting for you downstairs!\u201d A boy stood outside the door and shouted to Qin Ran.Qin Ran wasn\u2019t sitting straight and looked a little lazy. Her whole appearance and style were unique and her long soft hair was tucked behind her, making her feel very cold and chilly.The boy saw Qin Ran nod and his mind was filled with her casual smile.Mu Nan was waiting for Qin Ran downstairs.\u201cIs the school forum bothering you?\u201d Mu Nan was wearing a black and red plaid shirt. His originally cold expression had relaxed a lot. He was usually quiet, which made people feel afraid to come forward to communicate with him.His warm-colored clothes had somehow helped him reach a balance point.Qin Ran wondered why Mu Nan was here to find her. She smiled, holding her phone in her left hand. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dMu Nan nodded, and the hand in his pocket relaxed.Mu Nan had been selected as the campus king of grade one the moment he came and was a little famous in school. He was considered cold but wasn\u2019t as arrogant as Xu Yaoguang. The coldness just seeped from his bones.Mu Ying waved at Mu Nan from not far away.\u201cCousin.\u201d Mu Ying knew about the post on the school forum. She didn\u2019t expect things to have calmed down when she came to school on Monday and couldn\u2019t help but glance at Qin Ran.Qin Ran nodded.She was on her way to the school doctor\u2019s office. Mu Nan went home with Mu Ying and they split ways.Not far away, the sound of a motorcycle\u2019s engine rumbled.Mu Ying was surprised. \u201cSomeone rode a motorcycle to school?\u201dBeside her, Li Yuhan quickly pulled her sleeves, her expression changing. \u201cIt\u2019s Wei Zihang, don\u2019t block the road.\u201d\u201cWei Zihang?\u201d Mu Ying thought this name sounded familiar. She had often heard his name from the other girls in class and he seemed to be a school bully that couldn\u2019t be provoked.She couldn\u2019t help but look towards the source of the sound, only to see a royal blue motorcycle roaring over.It drove blatantly in school and did not stop.Mu Nan stood beside Mu Ying and Li Yuhan and couldn\u2019t help but stare at Wei Zihang.\u201cStop looking, Wei Zihang is the school bully of the school next door.\u201d Li Yuhan patted her shoulder. \u201cI heard that his family has some connections with the underworld. Can\u2019t you see that nobody is stopping him from driving his motorcycle in school? That motorcycle must cost at least a few hundred thousand yuan.\u201dMu Ying was even more surprised. She nodded, but her eyes still followed behind the motorcycle.**At the same time.Qin Yu got off at En Yu Hotel and Ning Qing was standing in the lobby waiting for her.\u201cYou\u2019re just on time.\u201d Ning Qing smiled brightly at Qin Yu. \u201cMadam Feng is already waiting upstairs. You can get closer to her.\u201dQin Yu naturally knew this without the need for Ning Qing to say it. She nodded and followed Ning Qing upstairs.Feng Ci didn\u2019t come today. He was supposed to come but had been delayed by something.Lin Jinxuan was there.\u201cI heard that Yu\u2019er is going to visit a famous teacher in Beijing?\u201d Madam Feng looked at Qin Yu with a smile.Qin Yu pursed her lips slightly. \u201cYes, I\u2019m practicing a score for him.\u201dNing Qing let someone bring Qin Yu\u2019s violin over. She saw that Madam Feng liked it and asked Qin Yu to perform a piece.Qin Yu didn\u2019t refuse. The piece she had rearranged was already familiar to her.Other than the difference in artistic style, her proficiency, and basic skills would help her play well.Madam Feng watched as Qin Yu played the last note and was inexplicably a little distracted and thoughtful.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Qin Yu\u2019s heart jumped at the sight of Madam Feng\u2019s expression.Madam Feng returned to her senses and took a sip of tea before smiling slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You\u2019re very good, you can even go on a tour.\u201dIt was just that\u2026 Madam Feng felt like this style was very familiar. She had probably heard it before, but she couldn\u2019t remember where she had heard it from.She was only thoughtful.Qin Yu was used to compliments and had this level of confidence. She pursed her lips and said, \u201cOh yes, mother. About sister, I don\u2019t know if\u2026\u201dNing Qing frowned and knew what Qin Yu wanted to say. She hurriedly signaled to Qin Yu not to say anything in front of Madam Feng.Qin Yu pursed her lips and glanced at Madam Feng, hesitating\u2026\u201cTell me.\u201d Madam Feng took a piece of tissue paper and wiped her hands.Qin Yu seemed to hesitate and then finally sighed before saying, \u201cI heard that my sister knows Mayor Feng.

She didn\u2019t expect Madam Feng to not know about Qin Ran\u2019s existence\u2026Ning Qing subconsciously picked up a cup of tea and avoided Madam Feng\u2019s inquisitive gaze. She always deliberated avoided talking about Qin Ran when she hung out with acquaintances.\u201cYes.\u201d Qin Yu reacted and smiled. She felt bad, so she pursed her lips instead. \u201cShe told people that she was close to Mayor Feng, so I just wanted to ask you.\u201dWho knew that Madam Feng didn\u2019t even know about her existence.\u201cShe told people she was close to Old Feng?\u201d Madam Feng seemed to understand the situation after hearing Qin Yu\u2019s words. She carried her teacup and laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s strange, Old Feng isn\u2019t close to a lot of people.\u201d\u201cOh, so they don\u2019t know each other.\u201d Qin Yu lowered her head and covered her smile. \u201cI must have heard wrongly then.\u201dBecause Feng Ci wasn\u2019t here, Lin Jinxuan was sitting at the side and was just serving the tableware for the ladies without speaking.But hearing this, he looked up and asked Qin Yu, \u201cWho did you hear this from? She doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of person to say such things.\u201dLin Jinxuan also understood Qin Ran.She didn\u2019t talk much and was cold. She was completely different from Qin Yu and had always a youngster\u2019s sense of carefree spirit between her brows.Because of this, he subconsciously defended Qin Ran.Qin Yu pursed her lips and looked at Lin Jinxuan. She felt moody inside but still continued smiling. \u201cI heard it from someone else.\u201dMadam Feng wasn\u2019t very interested in Qin Yu\u2019s sister and changed the topic to ask about Qin Yu.Qin Yu wasn\u2019t considered the best amongst the ladies in Yun Cheng, but she was still rather famous. It was rumored that she played the violin very well and was much better than Pan Mingyue, who only stayed at home gloomily every day.She took Qin Yu\u2019s hand and chatted for a long time.When Madam Feng left, Ning Qing asked Qin Yu, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with your sister?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I heard from someone else. She borrowed Mayor Feng\u2019s name and made them take down the post,\u201d Qin Yu said lightly.**The school\u2019s medical office.Qi Chengjun carried a curly dog with black eyes out of nowhere inside. \u201cCheng Mu, prepare a cage for me. I\u2019ll let someone send it over to your goddess, so you must be careful with it.\u201dCheng Mu was always very slow and kept a straight face. He wasn\u2019t very serious about this matter.When he heard Qi Chengjun mention his goddess, his spirits quickly rose.He took out his phone contacts and helped Qi Chengjun arrange the matter quickly.Lu Zhaoying was playing with his mobile phone and sitting next to Qin Ran. He didn\u2019t look up and explained, \u201cCheng Mu\u2019s goddess likes dogs. Other than Cheng Juan, Cheng Mu is most attentive towards her.\u201dHe pressed his phone with one hand and explained casually.He swiped onto a page and his smile slowly faded.He turned and saw Qin Ran holding a foreign language book with her head down, looking very serious.Lu Zhaoying pursed his lips and put away his phone. He then stood up and gestured to Cheng Juan, who was fiddling with the mannequin on the other side.Cheng Juan had intended on ignoring Lu Zhaoying, but when he saw him mouth \u201cQin Ran\u201d, he thought for a while and put down the stuff in his hands. Then, he followed Lu Zhaoying out slowly.\u201cA picture of Qin Ran and Feng Loucheng has been posted by someone on Weibo and it has been put on the hot search for promotion.\u201d Lu Zhaoying frowned anxiously. \u201cI went to get the surveillance video last time from the school and posted it on their school forum. I suspect that it was the same person.\u201dCheng Juan nodded, his expression surprisingly calm.But his eyes became darker.\u201cYou know the marketing techniques have always been disgusting, what can we do now? Should I make people take it down?\u201d Lu Zhaoying wasn\u2019t clear about the relationship between Qin Ran, Feng Loucheng, and Principal Xu.But to his knowledge, this must be related to the case from three years ago.He handed the phone to Cheng Juan.Cheng Juan scrolled through it and saw the usual sensitive and disgusting things on Weibo.The comments below were naturally unsightly.Lu Zhaoying saw Cheng Juan\u2019s expression darken.\u201cDo it.\u201d Cheng Juan took out a cigarette from his pocket. Then, he thought of something and didn\u2019t light it, just played with it in his hand, his usual lazy smile gone.He threw the phone back to Lu Zhaoying, bit the unlit cigarette, and then said in a cold voice, \u201cAlso, investigate this person. This person has bought so many marketing spots on the platform, they must not be an ordinary person. I want to see who would be so malicious to a high school girl.\u201dLu Zhaoying thought, Who in Beijing doesn\u2019t know the level of Master Juan\u2019s scheming? If this idiot knew that Master Juan is controlling the scenes, he would cry.**The spread of Weibo was unthinkable to everyone in school.Lu Zhaoying had already suppressed most of the marketing spots, but the next morning, the majority of the netizens on Weibo had already arrived at First Middle School.The personnel department of First Middle School held an emergency meeting regarding this matter. When this matter had spread on the school forum, nobody knew that it would reach this point.It was also about time that class 3.9 came to know about this.Lin Siran and Xia Fei went to the toilet together to wash their hands and heard some people whispering about it. They searched and out popped a bunch of popular Weibo posts.They hurried back to the classroom to find Qin Ran.\u201cRan Ran.\u201d Lin Siran frowned. \u201cThe people on Weibo are crazy. They don\u2019t even know you but are talking nonsense and even want people to come find you?\u201d\u201cWeibo?\u201d Qin Ran glanced lazily at her.\u201cDon\u2019t you have Weibo?\u201dQin Ran paused and chuckled. \u201cI haven\u2019t used it for half a year.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to care about the post on Weibo, go and find the Dean first.\u201d Lin Siran\u2019s thinking was very clear. \u201cWe can\u2019t deal with this matter and only the school can settle it.\u201dLin Siran knew Qin Ran\u2019s temperament after such a long time with her.She knew that Qin Ran didn\u2019t care about this matter, so she dragged Qin Ran to Gao Yang\u2019s office.Unexpectedly, Gao Yang also went to find her.\u201cThe school leaders are also looking for you. Come with me.\u201d Gao Yang pushed down his glasses and smiled gently.Qin Ran followed Gao Yang and went to the Dean\u2019s office building.The female teacher from the last time was also there. She didn\u2019t dare to look at Qin Ran and just carried her things out. But when she came out, she saw Qin Yu going upstairs with a pile of materials.The female teacher knew her and they greeted each other.Qin Ran looked into the office. \u201cIt\u2019s Qin Ran.\u201dThe female teacher was surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re close to her?\u201d\u201cNot really, but I just talked to Madam Feng yesterday.\u201d Qin Yu tucked her hair behind her ears. \u201cIt\u2019s the mayor\u2019s wife. I heard some students say that Qin Ran knew Mayor Feng, so I asked Madam Feng when we were eating, but she said she didn\u2019t know her.\u201dThe female teacher paused violently and turned. \u201cThank you so much, student Qin!\u201dShe turned and hurried straight into the Dean\u2019s office!Liked it?

Lin Jinxuan\u2019s attitude last night had made her a little flustered.After thinking for a while, she lowered her head and dialed a number.\u201cHello, mom.\u201d Qin Yu glanced over at the office, her eyes shining. \u201c\u2026 Nothing, I just wanted to tell you that I saw Sister in the Dean\u2019s office. Did she call you?\u201d**After one night of inquiries, Lu Zhaoying finally found the person behind it.He was surprised when he got the information.\u201cWho is it?\u201d Cheng Juan put down his pen and pressed his temple, his tone calm.Lu Zhaoying leaned to one side, stuck his hand in his pocket, and threw the information in front of him. \u201cYou would never have guessed. I traced it back to the Xu family. And it seems this person has something to do with the Xu family.\u201d\u201cXu family?\u201d Cheng Juan leaned on the backrest and knocked on the table with narrowed eyes. \u201cElder Xu isn\u2019t this kind of person.\u201d\u201cOf course not. This is just a small figure who is associated with the Xu family, how could this person know Elder Xu.\u201d Lu Zhaoying laughed and then frowned. \u201cThis person also knows Young Master Xu.\u201dCheng Juan glanced at him, thought of the name, and was uncertain. \u201cXu Yaoguang?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Lu Zhaoying snorted. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t Young Master Xu who contacted the marketing person. It was Qin Yu, Qin Ran\u2019s sister. I think she knew about the marketing person through Young Master Xu.\u201dLu Zhaoying was too lazy to remember his name.Cheng Juan smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s quite bold.\u201d\u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t expect anyone to check on her.\u201d Lu Zhaoying analyzed him closely and saw that Master Juan\u2019s eyes were cold.\u201cHave you gotten the evidence?\u201d Cheng Juan picked up his pen again.\u201cI have a few screenshots and the transfer records.\u201d Lu Zhaoying reached out to touch his ear studs and clenched his teeth.Cheng Juan nodded and said in a nasally sound, \u201cSplit it in two. Send one to Elder Xu and leave one.\u201dLu Zhaoying understood Cheng Juan\u2019s meaning. He printed out a few sheets of paper and put it away. \u201cOkay, leave it to me.\u201d**At the same time, inside the office.The Dean was very polite to Qin Ran. \u201cLast night, some people have already subdued the hot search, but some insiders are still adding fuel to the fire. The school will settle the rest.\u201dGao Yang was actually very anxious. He had come to the Dean to minimize the impact of this incident.But he didn\u2019t expect the Dean to have arranged everything even before he spoke.He was a little stunned.The Dean looked gently at Qin Ran. \u201cDo you have any questions?\u201dHe actually knew about Qin Ran\u2019s existence long ago, ever since Lin Qi had given him her files.At that time, he had rejected her.But who knew that she would be recommended by the Principal to attend First Middle School?She was also linked to Feng Loucheng, so the Dean found it hard to be rude to Qin Ran.Qin Ran raised her head and thanked him. She was quite polite, but her face was expressionless.\u201cSorry for the trouble.\u201d Gao Yang\u2019s tense nerves loosened in an instant and he quickly spoke for Qin Ran.He had been wondering how Qin Ran would have done such a thing when she was such a good student.Bam\u2014At this time, the door was pushed open.\u201cDean, I just got news that Mayor Feng doesn\u2019t know any high school students.\u201d The female teacher walked in and stared at Qin Ran, her expression weird.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d The Dean pressed onto his temple, his head aching. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to care about this matter.\u201dThe female teacher looked at Qin Ran, sneering.\u201cI knew it. Why don\u2019t you ask classmate Qin Ran if she really knows Mayor Feng?\u201d The female teacher knew Qin Yu\u2019s identity. She would never lie, so the liar must be Qin Ran.Unexpectedly, after she finished speaking, Qin Ran wasn\u2019t in the least bit panicked. She just glanced at her indifferently.Gao Yang was a little confused.Why was this linked to Mayor Feng again?\u201cDean.\u201d The female teacher looked away from Qin Ran and turned her attention to the Dean. \u201cStudent Qin Ran only used Mayor Feng\u2019s name to make the school cover for her. She doesn\u2019t know Mayor Feng in fact. This behavior is extremely vile.\u201dThe Dean\u2019s forehead was throbbing.He turned to Qin Ran and said in a soft voice, \u201cStudent Qin Ran, can you contact Mayor Feng?\u201dAfter a pause, he said again, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m doubting you. I just have a few details that require Mayor Feng\u2019s help. He is involved in this matter, after all, so we must take some precautions.\u201dQin Ran stood on the spot.She tilted her head, glanced at the female teacher, and thought about something. Then, she smiled and nodded. \u201cSure.\u201dShe was still calm and unhurried.The female teacher felt like something was wrong and didn\u2019t quite understand it, but she still passed her phone over. \u201cWait, I found the mayor\u2019s hotline. You can call it.\u201dShe handed the phone to Qin Ran.Qin Ran didn\u2019t look up and just turned the phone in her hand. She opened her address book and found a name.The female teacher glanced over.It was the address book, and she saw three words on it\u2014Feng Loucheng.She was so good at pretending.The female teacher didn\u2019t think that Qin Yu\u2019s news had an error and was anxious to expose her. She opened her mouth directly and said satirically, \u201cYou even have the Mayor\u2019s private number. You can call now, then.\u201dQin Ran ignored her and dialed the number directly.Liked it?

Our Dean wants to say a few words to you.\u201d Qin Ran directly interrupted him.The voice on the other end paused for a while. \u201cOkay, hand your phone over.\u201dFeng Loucheng\u2019s voice became more professional.The Dean explained to Feng Loucheng.\u201cMy apologies, I gave something for the child to eat and didn\u2019t expect this sort of big thing to happen. I have a meeting and can\u2019t take my leave. I\u2019ll let my secretary head over to the school. You don\u2019t have to worry about this matter, I will handle it well.\u201dThe office was very quiet, and everyone around could hear Feng Loucheng\u2019s voice.After all, he was Feng Loucheng. He was imposing and his words were clear and concise.From the moment she took her phone out expressionlessly to the moment she said her first sentence, the female teacher had felt an unknown hunch inside.The office was silent for a momentKnock knock\u2014Twenty minutes later, someone knocked on the office door and the Dean and the others immediately stood up.But it wasn\u2019t Feng Loucheng\u2019s secretary that came in. It was Ning Qing who hurried inside, the makeup on her face slightly messy.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, so sorry, Dean, my child has caused you trouble.\u201d Ning Qing quickly apologized and glanced at Qin Ran, who was sitting at the side while looking down and playing with her phone. She lowered her voice and said in a poor tone, \u201cQin Ran!\u201dQin Ran didn\u2019t look up and just ignored her.She kept her head lowered.Ning Qing\u2019s head ached even more. She opened her mouth and was about to say something.At this time, she felt a shadow fall in front of her.A young man carrying a briefcase walked in.Those who were a little more concerned about the world would be familiar with the face of Feng Loucheng who often appeared in the news and would be familiar with Feng Loucheng\u2019s secretary as well.This person who usually only appeared with Feng Loucheng on TV was actually here.The Dean was shocked that Feng Loucheng really paid attention to Qin Ran.\u201cMs. Qin.\u201d Secretary Li greeted Qin Ran first very respectfully.Only then did he smile and turn to the Dean. He handed a business card over to him. \u201cHello, Director Ding. I\u2019m Mayor Feng\u2019s secretary. I\u2019m here to deal with Ms. Qin\u2019s affairs.\u201dHe smiled and shook hands with the Dean.No one dared to speak and the female teacher\u2019s face had long gone pale. Her expression turned dark and cold sweat broke on her forehead as she muttered, \u201cQin Yu clearly told me that they didn\u2019t know each other\u2026\u201d\u201cDean, if there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll go back to class first.\u201d Qin Ran nodded to them and walked out.Nobody except Secretary Li dared to say a word.Ning Qing had rushed over in anger after receiving Qin Yu\u2019s phone call. She was now in a daze and could only stare at Qin Ran\u2019s back. Then, she turned to stare at Secretary Li, who was talking to the Dean.Her head was buzzing as if this was the first time she saw Qin Ran.**As everyone knows, things on Weibo should be subdued as soon and as calmly as possible.Three days later, there wasn\u2019t even a trace of Qin Ran\u2019s issue on Weibo and it couldn\u2019t even be found with keywords.It was like a drop of water in the sea, unable to create any waves.Qin Ran had her stitches removed by Cheng Juan.\u201cThis is a piece of document.\u201d Cheng Juan removed the stitches and asked her to pay attention to it before handing the information over to her.Since the Weibo issue was solved, it was time to catch the mastermind.He didn\u2019t act out and just left the matter to Qin Ran for her to handle it herself.Of course\u2014He was afraid she wouldn\u2019t handle it well.He had also asked Principal Xu at the same time. According to his degree of concern for Qin Ran, he certainly wouldn\u2019t sit back and ignore this matter.Qin Ran bit the lollipop in her mouth and looked down at the document.She also had a copy of this document, which was even more detailed than the one Cheng Juan just gave her.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d Cheng Juan asked.Qin Ran looked up with misty and intoxicating eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYour candy,\u201d he said softly, pointing at the lollipop.Qin Ran took out another lollipop from her pocket and handed it to him. \u201cEat it. Don\u2019t worry, I have a lot.\u201dShe didn\u2019t wear a jacket today and was wearing a plaid shirt that she had neglected for a long time. It was red and black, and the buttons were all buttoned up. Her shirt was stuffed into her jeans and her waist was very thin. The clear lines of her figure could be seen under the shirt she had tucked into her jeans.The sunlight outside the window hit her face and dazzled slightly on her face.Cheng Juan smiled lazily and stared at it before taking out a cigarette and biting it, but he didn\u2019t light it.Cheng Mu came in from outside with a mobile phone. \u201cMaster Juan, Hao Dui\u2026\u201dHe was about to say something, but as soon as he saw Qin Ran, he swallowed his words and glanced at her subconsciously.The thread on Qin Ran\u2019s hand had been removed and she stood up by supporting herself on the table.She heard Cheng Juan say, \u201cJust say it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hao Dui has come to Yun Cheng to find you. They\u2019re right outside,\u201d Cheng Mu glanced at Qin Ran and said blankly.**The Principal\u2019s office.Xu Yaoguang knocked on the door and entered. He said in a respectful voice, \u201cGrandpa.\u201d\u201cSit.\u201d Principal Xu pointed to the chair by the door and closed the document in his hand. \u201cI heard you like a girl in school very much?\u201dXu Yaoguang seemed surprised. \u201cGrandpa, you\u2019re talking about\u2026 Qin Yu?\u201d\u201cShe borrowed your name and did something. Of course, it doesn\u2019t mean that your network can\u2019t be used\u2026\u201d Principal Xu tapped his finger on the table and was silent for a while. Then, he continued to say, \u201cGrandpa just doesn\u2019t understand. Why didn\u2019t you take a fancy on Qin Ran, and yet found someone like that?\u201dThen, Principal Xu pushed the document on the table over to Xu Yaoguang. \u201cLook at this.\u201dLiked it?

He took the cup of tea and took a sip. \u201cDo you have anything to say about Qin Yu? Grandpa wants to hear your opinion.\u201dXu Yaoguang turned over the pictures and then put the document back.He looked up at Principal Xu and seemed to think for a while before saying in a respectful tone, \u201cGrandpa, why do you think I like her?\u201dPrincipal Xu had lived to this age and was usually good at discerning people.Especially this grandson. Although he was outstanding enough, he was thoughtful and couldn\u2019t take over him.At this moment, he didn\u2019t expect Xu Yaoguang to give this answer and was a little surprised. \u201cYou don\u2019t like her?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen why did you disagree when I asked you to get engaged?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never thought of getting married.\u201d Xu Yaoguang\u2019s eyes were clear, but they were still cold and calm.Principal Xu was silent for a long time.When he left the principal\u2019s office, Xu Yaoguang didn\u2019t take the document. He didn\u2019t go downstairs and just stood at the end of the corridor, watching a group of teenagers playing basketball in the playground not far away.Fresh and bright.His grandpa, Qiao Sheng, and the students of First Middle School, and even Qin Yu herself seemed to think he really liked her.1**The Lin family\u2019s house.\u201cAunt Zhang, go tidy up one room on the second floor.\u201d Lin Qi instructed at the dinner table.Ning Qing had been thinking about Qin Ran and Feng Loucheng for the past two days. She looked up in surprise at this. \u201cIs someone coming?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Xinran. She\u2019s also in her third year of high school and wants to come back to Yun Cheng for the college entrance examination.\u201d Lin Qi put down his chopsticks. \u201cI only heard about this from Dehai today.\u201dThe Meng family was on Lin Jinxuan\u2019s grandfather\u2019s side. Lin Jinxuan\u2019s mother died for many years, but the contact between the two families never stopped.Their business center had located itself in Beijing in recent years. If Meng Xinran wasn\u2019t in the third grade this year, she wouldn\u2019t have come back.At the dinner table, Lin Jinxuan and Lin Qi discussed the matter.Qin Yu was distracted.Several days had passed and Wu Yan had completely lost the news on Weibo\u2019s hot search engine.Qin Yu couldn\u2019t reach the blogger again.Xu Yaoguang used to find her to discuss problems or listen to her playing the violin. She had always been detached from Xu Yaoguang, but now he was really behaving like this.She felt more uneasy instead.She had been distracted in class these past few days too.Qin Yu sat on the chair, her long hair sliding down her shoulders, covering her dark eyes.After a long while, she looked up. \u201cMom, I want to bring my sister over to Teacher Wei in Beijing too. You know, she played the violin before too.\u201dNing Qing was quite surprised. \u201cBring her over?\u201dQin Yu nodded.Lin Qi was almost done with his dinner, but he didn\u2019t leave. He raised his eyebrow in surprise when he heard this. \u201cHave you talked it over with your aunt?\u201d\u201cI will tell Aunt myself, she probably won\u2019t reject.\u201d Qin Yu smiled warmly.Ning Qing naturally knew Lin Wan\u2019s character. If Qin Yu was to mention this, Lin Wan might react with disgust.If it had been in the past, Ning Qing would have never let Qin Yu take the risk.But now, Ning Qing remembered meeting the Mayor\u2019s secretary a few days ago in the office and nodded in a sullen mood.Qin Yu lowered her head and felt her doubts deepen.**In the afternoon.Class had just ended.After Qin Ran removed her stitches, she was in a good mood.She was getting ready to go to the hospital to see Chen Shulan when she received a call. It was from Ning Qing.Qin Ran pretended she didn\u2019t see it.However, Ning Qing persisted.Qin Ran thought about it and still picked up.Ning Qing was afraid of bumping into an acquaintance and wouldn\u2019t bring Qin Ran outside for the time being, so she made an appointment with her at the Lin family\u2019s house at night.\u201cIt\u2019s Ms. Qin.\u201d Aunt Zhang glanced up and down at her. \u201cCome in.\u201dQin Ran\u2019s right hand was in her pocket, her eyes were narrowed, and she was too lazy to bother about her.Her eyes swept across the room.Ning Qing was sitting on the sofa somewhat absent-minded. Qin Yu was coming downstairs.Qin Ran didn\u2019t sit and was still holding a roll of paper in her left hand.Qin Ran stared at Qin Yu for a moment and then looked away. She looked casually at Ning Qing and said, \u201cWhy did you call me over?\u201dNing Qing stood up, stared at Qin Ran, and smiled. \u201cRan Ran, you\u2019re here\u2026 your hand\u2026\u201dQin Ran was quite impatient. \u201cNo need to be modest with me. What\u2019s the matter?\u201dNing Qing paused and was a little unhappy inside, but she still endured it. \u201cYour sister is going to Beijing in a month. Teacher Wei is very good and I\u2019m preparing for you to head over with her to broaden your knowledge.\u201dQin Ran tilted her head and her hair fell across her forehead. Her eyes were cold and the corner of her mouth was hooked sinisterly as she looked at Qin Yu indifferently. \u201cGo to Beijing? Are you sure she has such good intentions?\u201dNing Qing was somewhat dissatisfied with her attitude. \u201cWhat do you mean? Your studies aren\u2019t good. If you learn the violin, you can still take the art path. Your sister is doing this entirely for you.\u201d\u201cSister, don\u2019t get me wrong. I just want good things for you. You also know that your studies\u2026\u201d Qin Yu paused and then continued, \u201cTeacher Wei is very famous. Even if he doesn\u2019t keep you as his disciple, you will still benefit greatly from his advice.\u201dQin Ran sneered.She had always been like this, cold and mean. She always looked cold and evil when she looked at others.She wasn\u2019t as obedient and quiet as Qin Yu.Ning Qing was agitated by her expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s with your expression? Your sister is doing it for your sake!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d At this time, Lin Qi came in from outside and handed his briefcase to Aunt Zhang.His gaze swept across Ning Qing and Qin Yu and finally fell on Qin Ran. He smiled. \u201cOh, Ran Ran is here.\u201d He paused and then said, \u201cWhy, are you arguing?\u201d\u201cDad, it\u2019s okay, it was my fault. I made her angry\u2026\u201d Qin Yu pursed her lips and lowered her head so that her face couldn\u2019t be seen.Lin Qi was stunned and he said in a gentle voice, \u201cYu\u2019er, talk nicely to your sister. She\u2019s not\u2026\u201d\u201cBam\u2014\u201dQin Ran raised her hand and threw a few sheets of paper on the table. She stared at Ning Qing and said, \u201cI have nothing to say. I just hope you can manage Qin Yu better. Uncle Lin, you\u2019ve helped me before, so I didn\u2019t hand this over to the court.\u201dQin Yu glanced at the papers on the table and felt uneasy.Lin Qi didn\u2019t know about what had happened on Weibo recently. He raised his hand to pick up the papers on the table and flipped through it. His face turned solemn and his gentle expression became heavy.The above was the chat record of Qin Yu contacting Wu Yan, as well as the chat record of her introducing the blogger to Wu Yan. The last one was the bank transfer proof of Qin Yu transferring 200,000 yuan to Wu Yan.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Take a look.\u201d Lin Qi handed the sheets of paper to Ning Qing.Ning Qing looked at it and her heart tightened instantly.Qin Yu felt more and more uneasy and her heart started beating rapidly. She approached the paper in Ning Qing\u2019s hand and looked through it.The chat records of her chat with Wu Yan, her chat with the blogger, and a record of her bank transfer to Wu Yan were all printed clearly.The blood on Qin Yu\u2019s face drained instantly and the veins on her neck bulged.She had thought of Qin Ran as an ordinary high school student, so she hadn\u2019t used a fake identity when she introduced Wu Yan to the blogger.Who knew that these chat records and even the bank transfer records would appear in Ning Qing\u2019s hands?The worst she had expected was that Wu Yan had come forward to expose everything. She could refute if that had been the case. However, Qin Yu didn\u2019t expect Qin Ran to have not only obtained the chat record silently but also the bank transfer record?When did she have such big abilities?\u201cFather, mother, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Qin Yu embraced Lin Qi\u2019s arm, her eyes quickly misting. \u201cWu Yan is my friend. I didn\u2019t know that she asked me to supervise Weibo for this. And she\u2019s about to leave First Middle School, so how could I not lend her money when she asked\u2026\u201dThe panic in Qin Yu\u2019s heart burst instantly when she felt that Lin Qi didn\u2019t relax.Lin Qi lowered his head and glanced at her. \u201cWu Yan is your friend, but you lent her 200,000 yuan without asking? How did she know that you were familiar with the blogger?\u201dQin Yu was a bit stiff and quickly spoke, \u201cThey all know that I\u2019m close to the blogger. Dad, you also know I only sleep five or six hours after practicing the violin. When would I have the time for this?\u201dLin Qi glanced at her.Then, he reached out to remove her hand and then turned to head upstairs.He massaged his eyebrows and seemed tired. \u201cYu\u2019er, let me think about it.\u201dDownstairs, Qin Yu didn\u2019t dare to follow him. She just collapsed on the sofa, her eyes trembling.Ning Qing ignored her and just sat down after throwing the sheets of paper all over the table.**A few days later.A jeep from Beijing was parked next to the school doctor\u2019s office.A tall man of about 30 years old got off from the front passenger seat. He had extremely prominent facial features, sharp eyes, cold and thin lips, and a beard emerging from his chin. He looked very clearly like a tough guy.He gave the school doctor\u2019s office a few glances.Then, he pushed open the door to enter.Qin Ran\u2019s right hand was almost healed, but there was still a slowly fading scar. Cheng Juan was giving her medicine.It was a pale green ointment that Qin Ran had never seen before.It felt cool on her wound.\u201cMaster Juan, about\u2026\u201d The man in his thirties came in while holding a stack of files in his hand. Before he finished, he saw the girl sitting opposite Cheng Juan and stopped.Obviously, ordinary people shouldn\u2019t know about this matter.Qin Ran kept the medicine and naturally excused herself.Cheng Juan leaned back and said casually, \u201cWait for dinner. Sit, this is Hao Dui, the great leader of Beijing\u2019s Criminal Investigation Team.\u201dHe turned to look at the man and said slowly, \u201cJust say it.\u201dHao Dui paused and then stared at Qin Ran for a while. Her eyebrows were lowered and she had a thin finger tapping her lips. Her facial features were exquisite and bright and she seemed a little cold.This expression was rare.He froze for a while and then said a few words to Cheng Juan. He still avoided Qin Ran and didn\u2019t say much.After a while, Cheng Mu, Lu Zhaoying, and Qi Chengjun returned.They were all quite happy to see Hao Dui.\u201cHao Dui!\u201d Lu Zhaoying went to pat him on the shoulder brotherly.Cheng Mu and Qi Chengjun were very serious and respectful. \u201cHao Dui.\u201dThese two were obviously extremely respectful to Hao Dui.Hao Dui cast a doubtful look at Cheng Mu, signaling at Qin Ran.Cheng Mu shook his head blankly.He laid out the meals. During the meal, Lu Zhaoying rambled on aimlessly.\u201cHao Dui, is my goddess here yet?\u201d Cheng Mu looked at Hao Dui expectantly.Hao Dui shook his head. \u201cShe has something to do and can\u2019t leave Beijing.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Cheng Mu was disappointed. \u201cThis case would be much easier to solve if my goddess was here.\u201dHao Dui nodded, but because Qin Ran was here, he just said vaguely, \u201cYes, this case isn\u2019t easy to solve. It\u2019s similar to case 712 from three years ago. If I can find the person who managed the case, I\u2019m 90% confident that I can catch them.\u201dHao Dui seemed to know some insider stories.Lu Zhaoying supported his chin in doubt. Hao Dui was the number one in the criminal investigation team and he rarely saw him so subdued. Thus, he was surprised. \u201cHao Dui, you can be subdued by someone too?\u201d\u201cThe person from 712\u2026\u201d Hao Dui finished eating and put down his chopsticks. He wanted to say something, but when he saw Qin Ran sitting on the side, he swallowed and said slowly, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dQin Ran kept her head lowered. While Hao Dui was talking, she picked up her rice with her chopsticks.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Cheng Juan lowered his head.\u201cNothing.\u201d Qin Ran shook her head.After dinner, Hao Dui called Cheng Mu out alone.\u201cWho is that girl?\u201d Hao Dui lit a cigarette for himself and narrowed his eyes slightly.\u201cA First Middle School student.\u201d Cheng Mu was expressionless.Hao Dui huffed a ring of smoke and narrowed his eyes. \u201cA student?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re doubtful, too, right?\u201d Cheng Mu was extremely calm and undulated. \u201cShe\u2019s not only a student, but her studies are also bad. Of course, she\u2019s very good looking\u2026\u201d\u201cBetter than your goddess?\u201d Cheng Juan had always been quite proud and Hao Dui had never seen him behave like this to anyone, so he was a little curious if this girl was unique in any way.\u201cHow could she compare to my goddess? My goddess is the number one female detective in the criminal investigation team!\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hao Dui guarded her like a wolf and Qin Ran rarely went to the school doctor\u2019s office.She laid on the table with her eyes slightly closed. Her school uniform was pulled up to cover her chin.Beside her, Lin Siran was explaining a question to Xia Fei.\u201cLin Siran, where did you get this notebook from?\u201d Xia Fei pointed to the notebook that Lin Siran had been referring to and asked.Lin Siran turned and glanced at her. \u201cRan Ran gave it to me.\u201dBut she seldom looked at it.\u201cI feel like the name is so familiar\u2026\u201d Xia Fei pointed to the three smooth words on the first page thoughtfully.Lin Siran smiled and wasn\u2019t bothered by this. \u201cThere are so many people in the world. Hundreds of people in the nation could have this name.\u201dIt was nothing strange.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Xia Fei shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen it before.\u201dXia Fei was so adamant about it, so Lin Siran couldn\u2019t help but pick up the notebook and turn over a few chapters. The words were written very seriously and every point was clearly explained.The focus was also very clear.Lin Siran was fascinated by it and only returned to her senses when the afternoon self-study was over.\u201cRan Ran, where did you get the notebook from?\u201d Lin Siran finally realized that Qin Ran had given her a treasure.\u201cSomeone gave it to me.\u201d Qin Ran blinked and looked at Lin Siran with her eyes squinted casually.Her eyebrows were lazy and smooth.Lin Siran knew Qin Ran quite well and didn\u2019t ask more.Instead, she copied Qin Ran, laid on the table, and talked about something else. \u201cRan Ran, it\u2019s the school\u2019s anniversary a few days later. Our class has organized a program, do you want to\u2026\u201dIn fact, this program had already begun since school started.It was the 50th anniversary, so the school attached great importance to it.At that time, Qin Ran hadn\u2019t transferred to class 3.9 yet.After Qin Ran turned around, she was a little cold and amused. She was good looking, but the entertainment committee didn\u2019t dare to ask her. Until a few days ago, when they finally relented and asked Lin Siran to be the middlewoman.Before Lin Siran even said anything, Qin Ran put a book on her head and said in a dull voice, \u201cI reject.\u201dLin Siran looked at her face in distress and said she was too arrogant.Qin Ran put on her headphones.She was too noisy.**After school in the afternoon, Qin Ran and Lin Siran went downstairs together.She always left late. She just got out of school when the same old man wearing a suit stopped her again.His attitude was tough and persistent. \u201cMs. Qin, Madam is looking for you.\u201dThis time, there were two bodyguards wearing black clothes behind him.Not far away, students cast doubtful glances over at them.Qin Ran took a deep breath. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201dFive minutes later.In a room not far from the school.Madam Feng was sitting by the window, looking at the girl sitting opposite with a steely face.\u201cYou\u2019re the female student that Feng Loucheng pushed away all his work to see at night?\u201d Madam Feng held the teacup in her hand elegantly, but her stare was full of thorns and ridicule.Qin Ran sat opposite her expressionlessly.Although she had always been cold, she was mostly casual and careless, with the frivolity of it being a game.Her delicate face was expressionless at the moment, and her eyes were deep and hazy.\u201cYou hid deep enough.\u201d Madam Feng threw the teacup on the table with a bam. \u201cShould I say that you\u2019re highly skilled?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Qin Ran took a deep breath, her voice undulated.But her eyes looked heavy.Hot and dry.\u201cLeave Yun Cheng.\u201d Madam Feng glanced at her. \u201cDon\u2019t try to find Feng Loucheng in vain. You\u2019re a student and can\u2019t compete against me.\u201dQin Ran smiled coolly.Her hand tightened around the cup and she said, \u201cMadam Feng, you\u2019re always like this, dominant and willful. You have no care for anyone\u2019s life\u2026\u201dShe lowered her eyes and almost smashed her cup at the person in front of her.But at that time, her cell phone rang\u2014It was a melodious sound of music.Qin Ran looked down. It was the alarm clock Cheng Juan had set for her, and there was a note on it\u2014Apply the green bottle of ointment.Her violent outburst was calmed a little.Qin Ran took a deep breath.She took out her mobile phone and dialed a number. \u201cUncle Feng, come over to Jingse Cafe.\u201d**Qin Ran didn\u2019t wait for Feng Loucheng to come. After the phone call, she went out.As soon as she walked out of the cafe, she saw Lu Zhaoying calling her at the door of the private restaurant opposite.Qin Ran\u2019s footsteps paused. She squeezed her phone and bit the candy in her mouth, thinking for a while before walking over to them.Qi Chengjun was absent.But Cheng Mu, Cheng Juan, and Hao Dui were all there.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in school?\u201d Cheng Juan hung up his phone and lowered his head to ask her.Qin Ran smiled, her face calm. \u201cI came out to meet someone.\u201dCheng Mu and the others all heard it, but they thought that Qin Ran meant she was just meeting a fellow classmate and didn\u2019t think much about it.Cheng Juan ignored the others, lowered his head, and directly asked Qin Ran, \u201cShall we eat lunch together?\u201dQin Ran didn\u2019t feel hungry when she was talking to Madam Feng just now. She didn\u2019t even drink the tea and also didn\u2019t eat the dessert.But now that Cheng Juan asked, she did indeed feel a little hungry.Qin Ran followed Cheng Juan into the restaurant. Lu Zhaoying wasn\u2019t interested in the case and also followed them.The three of them ate for less than ten minutes before Cheng Mu and Hao Dui came in.They looked listless.Lu Zhaoying touched his ear studs and propped his legs up, unsurprised. \u201cWhy, Team Leader Qian doesn\u2019t want to see you?\u201dHao Dui sat down silently and didn\u2019t say anything.Although he was the captain of the Beijing criminal investigation team, there were many such teams in the country. Although this Team Leader Qian was only in Yun Cheng, his reputation was even higher than that of Hao Dui.Lu Zhaoying grinned, looked at Cheng Juan, and then at Qin Ran.Finally, he put a piece of meat onto his bowl, then glanced at Qin Ran and explained, \u201cTeam Leader Qian is Yun Cheng\u2019s criminal investigation team\u2019s captain. He became famous three years ago. The most important thing is that he joined a detective agency three years ago, so you have probably never heard of him.

His fingertips were cold white and the blue blood vessels could be seen.There were some calluses on his fingers.Qin Ran looked up at him slightly and saw that he seemed quite upset. She couldn\u2019t help but to lean against the chair and laugh softly. \u201cIt\u2019s alright if the wound has healed.\u201dCheng Juan stared at her and didn\u2019t speak.Hao Dui seemed annoyed and only ate a few dishes before putting his chopsticks down.He took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth but didn\u2019t light it.Cheng Juan glanced at him and said unhurriedly, \u201cGo out.\u201dHao Dui was stunned for a few seconds, then he reacted and went out with his cigarette case without a word.After a while, Cheng Mu also carried his cigarette case and came out.\u201cWhat\u2019s with Master Juan?\u201d Hao Dui puffed out and squinted at Cheng Mu.Cheng Mu\u2019s face was quite complicated and he shook his head and said, \u201cAs you saw, this Ms. Qin\u2026 anyways, it\u2019s as you\u2019ve seen.\u201d\u201cIs she really a student in First Middle School?\u201d Hao Dui turned and looked doubtfully at Cheng Mu. \u201cCould she be like your goddess\u2026\u201d\u201cImpossible, don\u2019t compare anyone to my goddess.\u201d At the mention of his goddess, Cheng Mu was agitated.**They just finished eating when Cheng Juan\u2019s phone rang.It was Jiang Hui.Jiang Hui had helped Cheng Juan due to Qin Ran\u2019s matter last time and Cheng Juan didn\u2019t reject his appointment.\u201cQin Ran, I\u2019ll bring you to play.\u201d Lu Zhaoying insisted on bringing Qin Ran. \u201cDo you know how to play billiards? I\u2019ll teach you.\u201dToday was Friday and there was no class tomorrow.Qin Ran had never played pool before and had only seen it on TV.She couldn\u2019t win over Lu Zhaoying and so followed them.There were many clubs in First Middle School and many places to play. They reached a club in less than ten minutes by car.It was rather quiet here and seemed like a high-end club.Qin Ran didn\u2019t go inside and went to the washroom instead. By the time she came out, she saw Lin Jinxuan holding his phone and standing in the middle of the corridor calling someone.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Lin Jinxuan saw Qin Ran and was shocked for a moment. He said something to the person on the other end of the phone and then hung up.He was tall and drew a slender, long figure in the corridor.Qin Ran also didn\u2019t expect to see Lin Jinxuan here.Since the last Weibo incident, Lin Jinxuan had come to find her more than once because of Qin Yu.When the younger sister made a mistake, Lin Jinxuan, as the older brother, had to clean up her mess.\u201cA girl shouldn\u2019t run around in such a place, especially girls like you\u2026 come to my room with me first,\u201d Lin Jinxuan said and pulled on Qin Ran\u2019s sleeves. He turned and said with clear eyes, \u201cLuckily, Qin Yu is here too. She was involved with the issue last time and can apologize to you now.\u201dQin Ran pulled away.Every time Lin Jinxuan came to find her, he would stop his car outside the school gates just to discuss Qin Yu.Qin Ran thought for a while and decided to solve his issue first.Lin Jinxuan had many friends and they were basically all second generations of the rich families in Yun Cheng.When he pushed the door open, the group of people who were playing fiercely suddenly froze.The girl next to Lin Jinxuan had one hand in her pocket and her school uniform jacket tied around her waist. She looked indifferent and lazy, and the arrogance oozing from her could hardly be concealed.Qin Ran only recognized Feng Ci amongst the group of people inside.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d When he saw Qin Ran, Feng Ci also froze and felt like he had seen this girl somewhere before.\u201cShe\u2019s still in high school, don\u2019t you dare to mess around.\u201d Lin Jinxuan then gave a warning look at Qin Yu and reminded her to apologize to Qin Ran.Qin Yu pursed her lips.Lin Jinxuan seemed to be very busy.Before he could say anything to Qin Yu, his phone rang again.He tilted his head and told Feng Ci to take care of Qin Ran. Then, he warned the group of young masters again.\u201cThat girl is your brother\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d A woman in a black dress next to Qin Yu whispered to her. \u201cWhy is your brother so anxious about her? He\u2019s just going out to take a phone call, why did he have to ask Young Master Feng to take care of her?\u201dThese women always judged the situation and were clear on who they could provoke and who they couldn\u2019t.As soon as she spoke, a man with his hair dyed blonde laughed and took a puff from his cigarette. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve never seen her before. Is she your brother\u2019s girlfriend?\u201dTheir eyes didn\u2019t leave Qin Ran.If she was really Lin Jinxuan\u2019s girlfriend, then he didn\u2019t dare to touch her.This had always been the case. No matter how hard she tried, as long as Qin Ran was there, almost everyone\u2019s eyes would be on her.Qin Yu smiled. \u201cActually, she is my sister and is older by one year. She just came to Yun Cheng, because in high school\u2026 Anyways, she took a gap year and doesn\u2019t live in my house now\u2026 Second Young Master, it\u2019s an honor for her if you take a fancy towards her.\u201dThe people around exchanged glances and were all very surprised.Especially this Second Young Master. He stared at Qin Ran\u2019s long, straights legs, and then at her cold and casual face and took a puff from his cigarette again.He carried a glass of wine over.**At the same time.Jiang Hui\u2019s room was quiet. Besides Lu Zhaoying, there were only a few people inside.These people covered the sky with their hands in Yun Cheng, but sitting beside Cheng Juan, none of them other than Jiang Hui dared to speak much.Cheng Juan didn\u2019t drink, he just took a teacup and looked at the door.After a long while, he turned his head slightly and knocked distractedly on the table. He looked at Lu Zhaoying and asked with dark eyes, \u201cWhere is she?\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After hearing this, he froze.\u201cYeah, where\u2019s Qin Ran?\u201d He put down his cup, looked towards the door, and saw that nobody was there. \u201cShe told me she was going to the washroom just now.\u201dCheng Juan stared at him blankly and didn\u2019t speak.\u201cOh, no, she told me when you were talking to Uncle Jiang.\u201d Lu Zhaoying muttered, took out his cell phone, and gave it a glance.Qin Ran was gone for way too long. Lu Zhaoying knew her well and knew she wouldn\u2019t disappear without saying anything.He checked his phone and saw that Qin Ran had indeed left him a message on WeChat.\u201cShe said she went to C5\u2019s room.\u201d Lu Zhaoying narrowed his eyes. \u201cShe said she met an acquaintance.\u201dThis club was based on a membership system and the membership card was 5 million yuan, so those who could come here weren\u2019t ordinary people.\u201cMaster Juan, does Qin Ran have such rich friends?\u201d Lu Zhaoying thought about it and felt like something was wrong. She was such a poor person.Cheng Juan glanced at him and looked down again, not in the mood to talk to Jiang Hui.Lu Zhaoying still felt like something was wrong. While replying to Qin Ran, he stood up to find her.Cheng Juan\u2019s index finger tapped on the edge of the table, his fingertips white and transparent. \u201cI\u2019m going to the washroom.\u201dJiang Hui nodded.But he was stunned when he saw Cheng Juan walking out.Wait, they had a washroom in their room, and there were even two small cubicles. Why were both of them going out?\u201cYou absolutely won\u2019t imagine what they\u2019re doing it for.\u201d Hao Dui finally lit his cigarette after Cheng Juan was gone. He wouldn\u2019t know that the two of them were doing it for a high school student. \u201cThey\u2019re really two crazy\u2026\u201d\u201cFor that kid named Qin Ran?\u201d Jiang Hui laughed. \u201cShe\u2019s indeed very pleasing to the eye.\u201dHao Dui: \u201c\u2026 Ouyang Wei has never even received such praise from you. You\u2019re not the kind to look at the face\u2026 aren\u2019t you going too far?\u201d**At this time, inside room C5.\u201cFeng Ci, you\u2019re not drinking?\u201d The woman with long wavy hair curled up next to him with a glass of wine.Feng Ci smiled, straightened his clothes, and said in an icy voice, \u201cMy girlfriend doesn\u2019t like me to drink.\u201dThe woman\u2019s face stiffened.Feng Ci continued, laughing, \u201cOh, and don\u2019t lean so close to me. She doesn\u2019t like the smell of perfume.\u201dThe woman turned away in embarrassment.Someone next to him chuckled. \u201cYoung Master Feng, you\u2019re serious this time. Who is it? You\u2019ve hidden her for two years and haven\u2019t brought her to meet us?\u201dFeng Ci didn\u2019t speak and just turned to look at the woman that Lin Jinxuan had brought over.There were many wolves here, so he had to look out for Lin Jinxuan.The man with blonde hair still cared about Lin Jinxuan\u2019s remarks and also Feng Ci\u2019s presence, so he didn\u2019t do anything at the moment and only handed Qin Ran a glass of wine.Qin Ran didn\u2019t take it.She just lifted her head slightly and said, \u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t drink.\u201dWhen she said this, her cold tone was even lazier than usual.Her reddish thin lips were pursed distractedly and she was looking at the direction of the door.The blonde man didn\u2019t even feel annoyed at being rejected. He just stared at her face for a while, then he drank the rest of the wine in a gentlemanly manner and laughed while raising his glass. \u201cMy apologies.\u201dQin Yu\u2019s smile was stiff.When the blonde guy came back, she couldn\u2019t help but say, \u201cYoung Master Qian, why didn\u2019t you talk to my sister more?\u201dHe bit his cigarette, his eyes still on Qin Ran. \u201cShe was brought here by your brother, after all.\u201dQin Yu smiled and stopped talking. Lin Jinxuan couldn\u2019t be here forever.Lin Jinxuan hurried back and frowned when he saw the blonde guy sitting next to Qin Ran. He hastened his footsteps subconsciously.\u201cSorry for making you wait.\u201d He apologized to Qin Ran.Then, he turned his head to Qin Yu and said in a harsh tone, \u201cYu\u2019er, come here and apologize to your sister.\u201dQin Yu pursed her lips and lowered her head.She didn\u2019t speak.Lin Jinxuan\u2019s voice was solemn. \u201cQin Yu.\u201d\u201cSister, I\u2019m sorry. I was involved in the Weibo matter and I shouldn\u2019t have mentioned that blogger to Wu Yan. Can you forgive me?\u201d Qin Yu bit her lip.She always knew how to make use of her face. At this moment, tears dripped from her eyes, making her look extremely delicate and pitiful.Qin Ran smiled, not in the least bit bothered. She said very lazily, \u201cNo.\u201dQin Yu didn\u2019t expect Qin Ran to give this answer and her face went stiff immediately, and her expression couldn\u2019t be maintained.\u201cSister, I know you can\u2019t accept me yet, but I really want to apologize to you\u2026\u201dQin Yu looked up, her tone sounding aggrieved.Feng Ci and the people in the room didn\u2019t know what had happened but they all looked over.Qin Ran smiled and didn\u2019t speak to Qin Yu, but looked at Lin Jinxuan instead. \u201cDo you see that? She was clearly the one who did something wrong. She was the one who revealed the post on Weibo, who transferred money from her bank. Nobody forced her to do those things. She\u2019s so smart, why didn\u2019t she tell Wu Yan about the consequences of those things? But the moment she spoke, she made it seem like I was the one who bullied her.\u201dQin Yu\u2019s face turned pale, she started shaking and said tearfully, \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cI came here with you today just to say it in front of you.\u201d Qin Ran ignored Qin Yu and continued to look at Lin Jinxuan. \u201cShe can apologize, but I won\u2019t forgive her. You don\u2019t have to come to find me about this matter anymore and ask me to give up.\u201d\u201cSister, I really didn\u2019t mean it\u2026\u201d Qin Yu\u2019s tears flowed out. She didn\u2019t expect Qin Ran to dare to say such things in front of so many people.Wasn\u2019t she afraid they would call her malicious?\u201cDon\u2019t resort to petty tricks with me. Anyone who has you as their sister is truly unfortunate.\u201d Qin Ran smiled, her delicate eyebrows stained with coldness. Then, she nodded politely to Lin Jinxuan and said, \u201cI have other matters, so I\u2019ll take my leave.\u201dBy the time Lin Jinxuan returned to his senses, Qin Ran was already heading outside.He chased her immediately.Qin Yu called, \u201cBrother!\u201dLin Jinxuan simply ignored her and his footsteps didn\u2019t even pause for a moment.Qin Yu\u2019s face turned as pale as paper instantly.Lin Jinxuan followed Qin Ran, afraid that something would happen to her. Most of the people in the club weren\u2019t easy to provoke, and even he didn\u2019t dare to cause trouble here.Qin Ran\u2019s face was too provocative.Lin Jinxuan sped up, and as soon as he turned a corner, he saw Qin Ran. When he saw the man standing beside her, he paused and stared at the man with a rare expression of shock.Liked it?

Because of the angle and the dim lighting of the clubhouse, half of his face was covered by Qin Ran, but the man glanced over from a distance and made Lin Jinxuan feel his throat tighten.His mind exploded and Lin Jinxuan felt like his eyes looked very familiar.Feng Ci had just told him that two people had come to Yun Cheng, that their identities were fearful even to Feng Ci and he didn\u2019t dare to mention them.It was so much so that Lin Jinxuan deeply remembered their faces.But he never knew the names of the two people.There seemed to be a clear sound in his mind right now.Why was Qin Ran with this person?Around the corner.Qin Ran realized that Lin Jinxuan had come out, but she didn\u2019t want to have too much entanglement with the Lin family, so she didn\u2019t stop to greet him.\u201cWhy are you out?\u201d She saw Cheng Juan and raised her eyebrows.Cheng Juan turned and blocked Lin Jinxuan before saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to the washroom.\u201dLu Zhaoying walked around Cheng Juan broodingly and didn\u2019t bump into Qin Ran.After Qin Ran returned to the room, he kept insisting on teaching Qin Ran how to play pool.Hao Dui saw that Qin Ran entered and lowered his voice while talking to Jiang Hui.He had been talking to Lu Zhaoying, but when he saw him standing next to Qin Ran, he stopped mentioning it subconsciously.Qin Ran noticed it but wasn\u2019t bothered.She followed Lu Zhaoying to play pool.Qin Ran had never played before and was a little curious. She stood and watched him play, but was stopped by Cheng Juan when she was about to try.\u201cYour right hand isn\u2019t healed.\u201d Cheng Juan had been talking to Jiang Hui when he said to Qin Ran in a concise manner.Qin Ran didn\u2019t even touch the cue and just watched Lu Zhaoying explain to her the rules and theoretical knowledge of pool.**Lin Jinxuan walked back thoughtfully to room C5.Qin Yu felt like his condition was strange.\u201cBrother.\u201d Qin Yu pursed her lips and looked at Lin Jinxuan. \u201cDo you believe my sister\u2019s words? You are always like this. No matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t win against her.\u201dLin Jinxuan returned to his senses and looked at Qin Yu. \u201cYu\u2019er, you have your wrongs in this matter regarding your sister. From her perspective, she isn\u2019t totally unreasonable. Yu\u2019er, since she doesn\u2019t want to talk to you, you shouldn\u2019t provoke her in the future.\u201dThe people beside Qin Ran couldn\u2019t be provoked.Lin Jinxuan had been quite puzzled before. The Qin family had no background, so where had Qin Ran gotten Qin Yu\u2019s transfer records from?But now he seemed to understand.Qin Yu lowered her head and clenched her hands.She didn\u2019t expect Lin Jinxuan to say this. Lin Jinxuan had always been like this. No matter what happened, he was always so sensible and would think from the other person\u2019s perspective.Qin Yu had spent more than ten years trying to make Lin Jinxuan stand by her side.**The next day.It was Saturday.Feng Loucheng was waiting in the room, holding a teacup in his hand. He kept looking at the direction of the door.The door was pushed open by a pair of cold hands.He got up quickly and pulled the chair on the side, then bowed his head in shame. \u201cMs. Qin, I have already warned my wife about the matter and she will never dare to look for you again.\u201dQin Ran picked up the cup on the table and swayed it gently and slowly. \u201cOk.\u201dFeng Loucheng observed Qin Ran\u2019s expression and determined that she didn\u2019t really care, so he sat back down.He shook the bell and the meal was served. Then, he continued to say, \u201cSomeone has been trying to find Qian Dui and check on the matter.\u201dQin Ran raised her eyebrows and didn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cOh.\u201d\u201cI heard that the Poison Dragon has appeared again.\u201d Feng Loucheng paused and looked at her again. \u201cIt has been three years, you should come out now.\u201d\u201cUncle Feng, let\u2019s eat.\u201d Qin Ran knocked on the table with her hand.\u201cOkay. Is your hand healed?\u201d Feng Loucheng sighed heartily, but his attention was focused on the right hand she was using to hold her cup.Qin Ran put down the cup and spread her right hand for him to see.Feng Loucheng observed that a layer of meat had grown over the wound and traces of the stitching were still there. It looked like it had indeed been healed well, so he sighed in relief and said, \u201cThen I can report well now.\u201dThe chef had already started serving.Qin Ran stared blankly at the white porcelain plate in the chef\u2019s hand.It was steamed corn with sweet potatoes.Was there anything special?Was there anything different?No\u2014Whose private chef would serve such a dish?Was he a professional chef?**Cheng Juan had been practicing with his scalpel against the mannequin recently as he had an operation today.He usually received one operation per month.It had been almost two months since he had come to Yun Cheng, and this was his second operation.There was nobody in the school doctor\u2019s office and it was very quiet.Cheng Juan left all the keys of the school doctor\u2019s office to Qin Ran. Qin Ran held a computer and sat at Cheng Juan\u2019s desk to do her homework.Suddenly, the door was slammed open from the outside.Lu Zhaoying came in hurriedly, followed by a haughty Hao Dui.They looked around the school doctor\u2019s office and didn\u2019t see Cheng Juan.\u201cWhere\u2019s Master Juan?\u201d Lu Zhaoying panted.Qin Ran had her legs propped up and was flipping through a book. She looked up and said, \u201cHave you forgotten that he has surgery today?\u201d\u201cSh*t!\u201d Lu Zhaoying banged on the table. He had always used Cheng Juan as his backbone and couldn\u2019t think of what to do now. \u201cI really forgot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to find Qian Dui.\u201d Hao Dui couldn\u2019t find Cheng Juan and turned around.Lu Zhaoying wiped the sweat on his face. \u201cHe might not see you. Wait for me!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, why are you so anxious?\u201d Qin Ran glanced at Lu Zhaoying and Hao Dui\u2019s face, put down her book, leaned back, and raised her eyebrows.Lu Zhaoying had nothing to hide from her, so he said sullenly, \u201cLast night, Hao Dui had Cheng Mu check something, but we haven\u2019t seen him and he has disappeared. Master Juan definitely didn\u2019t bring his phone into the surgery room. Go to the hospital and wait there. When he comes out, tell him about this\u2026\u201dHao Dui had already been vexed over Cheng Mu\u2019s disappearance, but when he heard Lu Zhaoying telling Qin Ran about this, he turned over and reprimanded impatiently. \u201cWhy did you tell her? Are you messing around?!\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She simply rolled up her sleeves and said, \u201cMm.\u201dThat was the response she gave Lu Zhaoying.\u201cHao Dui!\u201d Lu Zhaoying had always been protective of Qin Ran.But this time it was urgent and he didn\u2019t have time to say more. He simply shot Hao Dui a warning look and left after letting Qin Ran know.Outside, Qin Ran placed the book back on the table and decided to take her keys with her anyway.**A half-hour later, she arrived at the hospital.There seemed to be more people here today. There was even a fleet of luxury cars at the entrance.Quite a number of people gathered around, taking pictures and uploading them onto social media platforms.Qin Ran walked into Chen Shulan\u2019s ward.Ning Wei and Mu Ying were around too.\u201cI\u2019ve been better these few days, you guys don\u2019t have to come and see me so often.\u201d Chen Shulan glanced at Qin Ran.Qin Ran pared an apple for Chen Shulan by her bedside.\u201cWho came yesterday?\u201d Qin Ran handed the pared and diced apples to Chen Shulan.She asked quietly when she saw the tulips on the bedside table.\u201cIt was Jinxuan. He comes over whenever he\u2019s free. He\u2019s a good boy, always making me happy.\u201d Chen Shulan smiled kindly as she brought his name up.\u201cHe seems more filial than that biological granddaughter of yours.\u201d Qin Ran cleared her throat.Ever since Chen Shulan was hospitalized, Qin Yu had never once paid a visit.Qin Ran had always been direct with her words, and Chen Shulan did not tell her off this time either.She simply smiled.Mu Ying tugged at Qin Ran\u2019s sleeves and whispered, \u201cCousin, it isn\u2019t nice to talk about Second Cousin this way. She\u2019s busy practicing her violin\u2026\u201dMu Ying did not dare say anymore when she saw Qin Ran\u2019s cold glare and quickly switched topics. \u201cCousin, did you see those cars when you were coming up? I don\u2019t recognize the brands, but they looked so domineering!\u201dShe sounded envious.Qin Ran simply shrugged and said she didn\u2019t know about it.Mu Ying was only asking casually.She wasn\u2019t expecting Qin Ran to recognize them either.But she did hear some people discussing downstairs, saying that most of the cars were limited edition, luxury models. \u201cI heard there are big shots around today. We might get to see them if we hang around a little longer\u2026\u201dQin Ran did not pay much attention to it. After visiting Chen Shulan, she went to look for Chen Shulan\u2019s doctor in-charge before going to Cheng Juan.**Cheng Juan\u2019s cell phone was switched off, but he did tell Qin Ran that he had to perform surgery before he left.Qin Ran was pretty sharp with her judgment. She was pretty sure that most of the luxury cars downstairs were there because of him.In that case, Qin Ran roughly knew his position.There was a VIP ward on the 29th floor with an isolated operating theatre. There were several security officers on that floor now, but Qin Ran could simply get a nurse\u2019s uniform and find her way in there.But she did not. She simply waited by the elevator.Besides her, there was also a group of successful men in custom-made suits and office bags, each with a personal assistant.As a young girl, she already stood out amongst them.Cheng Juan\u2019s surgery was pretty early, so Qin Ran did not have to wait very long. When the elevator doors opened, she saw a man emerge from among a crowd of doctors.At the same time, the group of successful men huddled forward towards the elevator.Cheng Juan trailed behind the hospital\u2019s director. He was in a white doctor\u2019s coat and the surgical mask was still hanging on one ear. He unbuttoned his coat with one hand, calmly and professionally.Even after hours of surgery, he did not seem the least bit exhausted.Crowded as it was, everyone maintained at least a 10-centimeter distance from him, and they\u2019d subconsciously lowered their voices too.It was a quiet scene.\u201cThe next surgery depends on the situation.\u201d His voice was slightly hoarse from the long hours without water. He received the pen from the director and was ready to go to the meeting room for a research discussion.But when he looked up, he caught sight of a cold figure at the corner, against the wall.Cheng Juan stopped in his tracks.The cream of the crop of the financial industry and the director intuitively stopped by his side as well.Cheng Juan was a renowned doctor in the field. A veteran cardiologist had even openly said that he was a natural talent, that he was born a doctor.He only performed one surgery a month, and most of these surgeries had less than a 10% success rate. Yet, he\u2019d never failed before.By right, one would expect that rich, scheming people would long have used him for their benefit.And yet, strangely, no one had dared approach him for such reasons before.Even those big shots from the financial industry were very respectful to him. Nobody in the medical field knew who was his backing or his identity and background.In any case, even the most successful bosses had to be respectful towards Cheng Juan.Cheng Juan was always very focused during surgeries and he made sure to keep his cell phone off.After the surgeries, he would also set aside a few hours to guide the accompanying doctors.Without fail.Those who knew him were therefore very shocked when he took his coat off and spoke to a girl so gently.Most of them stood by watching in confusion.Qin Ran cut the long story short and told him about Cheng Mu.\u201cI got it.\u201d Cheng Juan took his cell phone out while informing the director of the hospital. He then took Qin Ran along and walked out, his eyes deep and serious.He did not care that he left a group of people in utter shock behind him.He gave Lu Zhaoying a call and said a bit to him, then turned to Qin Ran. \u201cWait here for me, I\u2019ll get the car.\u201dQin Ran did not intend to go since Hao Dui did not really seem to like her anyway.It wasn\u2019t just dislike\u2014he despised her.But seeing that Cheng Juan rushed to get the car, she did not want to say much.Cheng Juan drove over a while later.\u201cGet in first.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the black car she was familiar with, but a blue Lamborghini. \u201cCheng Mu drove my car away yesterday. This car was sent over by Young Uncle at the last minute, but it\u2019s function isn\u2019t as good. It can\u2019t go up mountainous roads.\u201dCheng Juan explained.Qin Ran did not respond.**On the other side, Mu Ying was ready to leave after visiting Chen Shulan. She had just stepped out of the entrance when she noticed the stylish luxury car parked by the road.She stole a few more glances at it because it was so eye-catching, then she overheard a few men saying\u2014This car was a limited edition, its price was upward of 20 million yuan.Mu Ying would never have expected that sort of astronomical sum. She\u2019d thought that Qin Yu\u2019s violin\u2014worth 500,000 yuan\u2014was already the limit.But the next moment, she saw Qin Ran getting into the front passenger seat.\u201cCousin!\u201d Mu Ying intuitively called out to her.Liked it?

Is this your friend?\u201d Mu Ying was speaking to Qin Ran, but she couldn\u2019t help but direct her vision to the car instead.The Lamborghini\u2019s design was such that she wasn\u2019t able to see the driver\u2019s face. But she could see the pair of hands on the steering wheel\u2014slender and beautiful.She could tell that the driver wasn\u2019t an old person.Mu Ying tried to look further in.\u201cI\u2019ve something on,\u201d Qin Ran said succinctly. \u201cI\u2019ll go first.\u201d\u201cBut, Cousin\u2026\u201d Mu Ying didn\u2019t want Qin Ran to leave just yet. She looked towards the sports car with much interest.Cheng Juan casually said, \u201cQin Ran, it\u2019s time to go.\u201dQin Ran nodded at Mu Ying and then got into the car.There was no way she could see the driver from her point of view, so she could only watch it as the car left.**Yun Cheng wasn\u2019t big. If there wasn\u2019t any traffic congestion, an hour was all it took to get from North to South.Cheng Juan reached the destination in a while.Lu Zhaoying and Hao Dui were waiting in the lounge.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Cheng Juan asked when he entered.Hao Dui and Lu Zhaoying saw Cheng Juan enter and hurriedly said, \u201cRegarding Cheng Mu\u2019s matters, Qian Dui suggested that we call the police and refused to say more. Young Master Lu and I are waiting for him to knock off now.\u201dHao Dui was waiting for news about Cheng Mu as well.After all, Hao Dui wasn\u2019t a local Yun Cheng resident and he wasn\u2019t able to intervene much here. But he knew that Cheng Mu\u2019s disappearance couldn\u2019t be that simple. There would not be a point in calling the police.He was speaking when he saw Qin Ran enter discreetly behind Cheng Juan.She was playing games on her cell phone, unwilling to interfere.Qin Ran came in with Cheng Juan, and Hao Dui did not dare to tell her off in front of him.He simply gave her a cold look.\u201cHao Dui, someone sent you this.\u201d There was a knock on the door before a man came in and handed Hao Dui an old jigsaw puzzle.It was in a mess.Qin Ran hadn\u2019t played her game in days and she was waiting for it to refresh when she glanced at that old puzzle. It wasn\u2019t anything complicated, it would probably be a picture of a pet dog when it was completed.She looked away.Hao Dui furrowed his brows. \u201cWhy would anyone give me this for no reason?\u201dCheng Juan eyed the jigsaw puzzle and tilted his head. He asked Lu Zhaoying, \u201cIs there any old factory here in Yun Cheng? One that manufactures plastic?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure, I\u2019ve to ask Uncle Jiang.\u201d Lu Zhaoying took his cell phone out. \u201cMaster Juan, anything else you can decipher?\u201dHao Dui knew that this was likely sent by the person who took Cheng Mu away and hurriedly passed it over to Cheng Juan.Cheng Juan placed the puzzle on the table and pieced it together.It wasn\u2019t a complete set. There were missing pieces here and there.Cheng Juan looked at it for a while.Then, two people came into the lounge.\u201cMay I know which one of you is Hao Dui?\u201d The man who just entered looked about 40. His eyes were sharp and his clothes prim and proper.Hao Dui had been looking for Qian Dui for days, but he refused to meet him.Now that he\u2019d appeared all of a sudden, Hao Dui did not even have the time to think of what he was doing here. He stepped forward. \u201cI am.\u201dLu Zhaoying stood beside Cheng Juan and whispered, \u201cQian Dui wasn\u2019t intending to bother about us and asked us not to care about this matter. Why has he changed his mind now?\u201dAfter thinking for a while, Lu Zhaoying looked at Cheng Juan. \u201cMaster Juan, could he know you? \u2026 No, that\u2019s not right, he wouldn\u2019t have heard of you.\u201dLu Zhaoying couldn\u2019t figure out the reason.Cheng Juan simply looked at Qian Dui, as if in deep thought.\u201c157********, get the technology department to run a check on this number,\u201d Cheng Juan said to Qian Dui. \u201cIt probably isn\u2019t a postpaid card, but you can try tracing the communication route.\u201dQian Dui nodded and got the young technical personnel to see to it.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll need you to come up with a system. The person who handed Hao Dui the item is definitely in disguise, but you\u2019d be able to find some clues. The camera at the entrance should\u2019ve captured his face\u2026\u201d Cheng Juan went on instructing them.Qian Dui quickly figured out that Cheng Juan was the leader amongst them. He took another look at him.\u201cRoughly how long will it take you to get these done?\u201d Cheng Juan looked up at the technical personnel.The technical personnel responded, \u201cHalf an hour.\u201d\u201cThere are four plastic factories in Yun Cheng. How long will it take you to find the precise locations?\u201d Cheng Juan asked.\u201cI haven\u2019t tried. Give me about 20 minutes.\u201dHao Dui understood that this would probably give them Cheng Mu\u2019s address. He looked at the young technical personnel anxiously.Tension rose in the lounge.That was when a female voice yelling \u201cVictory!\u201d came from Qin Ran\u2019s cell phone, breaking the tension.Hao Dui looked in her direction impatiently.Qin Ran lowered the volume of her cell phone. When she looked up, she saw Hao Dui\u2019s unpleasant expression directed at her.Who would be playing games at a time like this?\u201cMiss, please don\u2019t disturb the technical personnel!\u201d Hao Dui warned Qin Ran in a mellow voice.The technical personnel was about to track down the location.But the location he found, in the end, was exactly where they were at.Lu Zhaoying widened his eyes. \u201cHow could this be?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s too much interference.\u201d The technical personnel sounded serious. \u201cIt would take about a day to get everything figured out from scratch.\u201dFor such a huge project, a day was considered pretty fast.\u201cBut your case 712 was really fast.\u201d Hao Dui looked straight at Qian Dui and the technical personnel.Qian Dui did not say a thing.Qin Ran kept her phone and stood up.Cheng Juan turned towards Qin Ran and handed the technical personnel\u2019s laptop to her. He smiled and said, \u201cFor you.\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even after Hao Dui said so many words to him, he didn\u2019t utter a reply.Hao Dui learned of how cold the people in this team were in the past few days.Qian Dui didn\u2019t even care about him despite his persistence in the past few days. He finally appeared today, perhaps because Master Juan was here.Hao Dui was about to ask the technical personnel some questions. However, he saw Cheng Juan handing over the laptop to Qin Ran and frowned. \u201cMaster Juan, why are you giving the laptop to her? Don\u2019t hold up the programmer\u2019s work.\u201dHe then looked unhappily at Qin Ran.As if asking, why wasn\u2019t she leaving yet?Lu Zhaoying didn\u2019t react in time. He tilted his head and seemed to also be deep in thought about Cheng Juan\u2019s intentions.Qin Ran looked at the laptop in Cheng Juan\u2019s hands and took it from him. Before she turned around, the technical personnel hurriedly stood up and made way for her.Qin Ran sat down and started to concentrate on her work.She pursed her lips as her slender fingers tapped away on the keyboard. Lines and lines of code that only programmers understood appeared on the screen.\u201cLocate it,\u201d Qin Ran said nonchalantly.The atmosphere around her changed once she started concentrating.The technical staff who was very cold to Hao Dui heard her and took out a cell phone from his pocket. He flipped it open and clicked on a switch on the left side. It then immediately turned into a mini-computer.\u201cLocating.\u201d The technical staff sat by her side and opened up the map.Following Qin Ran\u2019s instruction, he found an address in the north part of the city.Everyone saw how the technical personnel went through a ton of code and information during his testing.And still ended up with nothing.Not even 10 minutes had passed?And she got the location?\u2026 What the heck? Who was she?!Hao Dui\u2019s jaw dropped. He went from puzzled to surprised to numb. He thought he was hallucinating.Qian Dui brought a cup of tea and placed it beside Qin Ran\u2019s right hand. \u201cThis is green tea. I only used seven tea leaves, it\u2019s not too strong.\u201dHe then turned towards Hao Dui. \u201cI\u2019ve sent people to the abandoned factory in the North.\u201dHao Dui was completely speechless now.Lu Zhaoying recovered from the initial surprise. However, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from looking at Qin Ran again and again.\u201cMaster Juan, you knew this all along?\u201d Lu Zhaoying finally found his voice again.Clenching his fist and placing it by his lips, Cheng Juan coughed lightly. \u201cI had prior suspicion but only came to a conclusion now.\u201dCheng Juan felt there was something wrong when traces of Qin Ran were found in 712. He then found out more from the morse codes.He confirmed his suspicions when Qian Dui suddenly appeared.\u201cQian Dui shouldn\u2019t have heard of me before. From what you guys have told me, he didn\u2019t appear even after Hao Dui visited him so many times. That meant that he didn\u2019t want to be involved.\u201dLu Zhaoying was puzzled. \u201cBut that\u2019s just a guess?\u201d\u201cAfter Qian Dui came, his eyes kept shifting to her. This was his subconscious at play. From his microexpressions, he holds her in high regard.\u201d\u201c712?\u201d Lu Zhaoying was more puzzled. \u201cThat was three years ago, how old was she?\u201dCheng Juan didn\u2019t reply.\u201cHeck\u2026 You guys are all crazy good at this\u2026\u201dAfter a long while, Lu Zhaoying finally snapped back to his senses. He wiped his face and said emotionlessly.Both the technical personnel and Qian Dui, who were very cold to Hao Dui, centered around Qin Ran.Lu Zhaoying didn\u2019t want to interrupt but didn\u2019t dare to talk to Cheng Juan as well. He could only pat Hao Dui on the shoulder. \u201cActually, Qian Dui isn\u2019t so cold. Look at how enthusiastic he is to Qin Ran. Bringing tea and water, treating her like his dad!\u201dHao Dui was speechless.\u201cSay something!\u201d Lu Zhaoying shook his shoulders.He was choking in the silence. He would explode if no one talked to him.Hao Dui still remained silent.What the heck was there to say?!**Cheng Mu\u2019s address was out. Hao Dui looked at Qin Ran deeply and proceeded with Lu Zhaoying to save Cheng Mu.Qin Ran was surrounded by the people in the station.Cheng Juan stood at one side and saw how the technical personnel was looking at Qin Ran with admiration. The crowd around her was asking all sorts of questions, trapping her in.Lu Zhaoying and Hao Dui had left.Cheng Juan tapped on his phone with his fingers and squinted at them.Those surrounding Qin Ran heard a soft voice, \u201cDon\u2019t you have exam papers to finish?\u201dQin Ran felt a slight headache from the noise surrounding her.She couldn\u2019t think clearly.Cheng Juan\u2019s soft voice felt gentle to her ears.She identified it easily.Qin Ran\u2019s mind seemed to have found an answer as she rushed out from the crowd around her.She then said towards the crowd behind her, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I still have exam papers to finish. The teacher is waiting to check it.\u201dQin Ran heaved a sigh of relief and said softly, \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dCheng Juan looked down at her. Seeing her relaxed expression, he chuckled lightly.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go back.\u201dActing as if nothing had happened, he turned around and exited the doors nonchalantly. However, he intentionally slowed down.**By the time Cheng Mu was rescued by Hao Dui and the others, it was already two hours later at 5 pm.As Hao Dui and Lu Zhaoying had to proceed for handover, Cheng Mu didn\u2019t return with Lu Zhaoying. Instead, he took Qian Dui\u2019s car back to the school doctor\u2019s office.After arriving at the school doctor\u2019s office, he saw Hao Dui and Lu Zhaoying coming after recording the data.\u201cI thought I wouldn\u2019t see y\u2019all for a couple more days,\u201d Cheng Mu said emotionally after seeing them. \u201cHow did Qian Dui agree to help? And how did y\u2019all find me? I asked Qian Dui, but he didn\u2019t reply at all. He\u2019s such a cold person\u2026\u201dCheng Mu wanted to continue.But then, from the corner of his eyes, he saw Qin Ran getting a cup of water from the kitchen. He stopped and didn\u2019t continue in front of her.Qin Ran took a sip of water and glared at him. She wasn\u2019t bothered as she sat back on her chair and continued doing her practice papers casually, with one hand supporting her chin.Cheng Mu glared at her and frowned. Looking at Hao Dui and Lu Zhaoying, he said softly, \u201cLet\u2019s talk outside\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, Hao Dui cut him off emotionlessly. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have to talk outside or avoid her,\u201d Hao Dui said while staring at Qin Ran. \u201cShe saved your life.\u201dLiked it?

He avoided Qin Ran whenever he spoke, but at this time, he was silent.This time, Lu Zhaoying completely ignored Cheng Mu. He walked directly to Qin Ran\u2019s table and placed his hands on the table. He did not speak. Instead, he stared at her as if it was the first time he saw her.A moment later, Cheng Mu looked at Hao Dui numbly. He felt as if there was something wrong with his ears. \u201cHao Dui, didn\u2019t you save me with Qian Dui and the others?\u201d\u201cThe situation was complicated. Your location was uncertain and the technicians could not determine your specific location.\u201d Hao Dui succinctly explained. \u201cIt was her computer that determined your location. Otherwise, you would not have been saved by now.\u201dSo it was not wrong to say that Qin Ran saved Cheng Mu.\u201cAll Qian Dui\u2019s technicians could not figure out my location and she\u2019s the one who did it in the end?\u201d Cheng Mu had a hard time summarising the situation.\u201cYes.\u201d Although he had personally experienced the situation and tried to recall what happened again, Hao Dui still found it hard to believe. He clenched his fist before saying, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even half an hour.\u201dCheng Mu stopped talking.The school doctor\u2019s office was very quiet.In the past, Cheng Mu never paid much attention to Qin Ran. Now, he was dumbfounded and truly shocked.It was impossible that Hao Dui was joking.\u201cBut\u2026 how could she know?\u201d Cheng Mu stiffly protested.Qian Dui was famous in the industry because of the 712 cases they solved. His men were all elites and it was evident from the strength of his technical team.Cheng Mu was not the only one. Hao Dui and Lu Zhaoying were also confused. In their eyes, Qin Ran was just an ordinary high school student. How was it possible that she knew this type of technology?The entire situation was not described, but Cheng Mu could imagine the scene.\u201cQin Ran, you\u2019re too amazing.\u201d Lu Zhaoying finally found his voice. He slammed the table and excitedly exclaimed. \u201cWhen did you learn to program? You\u2019re more professional than the professional technicians!\u201dIn the past, Cheng Mu was only polite to Qin Ran because he was fearful of Cheng Juan. As he was surrounded by extremely outstanding people from a young age, he did not care much about Qin Ran and secretly looked down on her.However, after hearing Lu Zhaoying\u2019s words, Cheng Mu no longer ridiculed her.He only lowered his head to look at his hands. When he saw Qin Ran again, the look in his eyes was completely different from before.Qin Ran continued with her paper at the table.She was doing a chemistry paper.As his attitude towards Qin Ran changed, everyone in the school doctor\u2019s office became very interested in her.She was only a secondary three student. Why was she so good at programming?They pretended to pass Qin Ran without noticing her but inadvertently saw the paper she was doing.Unlike her expertise in software programming, her writing on the paper was not attractive. Her penmanship was like a primary school student\u2019s. Her words were far apart, not framed well, and had no corners.In fact\u2026On a closer look, only a few questions were right.Even Cheng Mu and Hao Dui, who were very curious about her, had some difficulties understanding her.\u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t Qin Ran awesome?\u201d As Lu Zhaoying helped Cheng Mu bandage his wound, he accidentally hurt him. Looking at them, Hao Dui could not help but burst into laughter while drinking ice water at the side.Qin Ran was sitting at the table inside and was separated from Lu Zhaoying by a glass door.If they lowered their voices, Qin Ran would not be able to hear their conversation.Cheng Juan took out his cell phone.Cheng Mu paused before whispering in a voice that could only be heard by the few people near him. Thoughtfully, he said, \u201cMaster Juan, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s strange? Why would a high school student that doesn\u2019t know anything coincidentally know this? Isn\u2019t this just too much of a coincidence?\u201dCheng Juan was currently on a call with someone. Hearing Cheng Mu\u2019s voice, he turned around slightly. His movements were always lazily, and he casually glanced at Cheng Mu without care.He did not explain much but slowly said. \u201cThree days later, there will be a lunch with Qian Dui. If you have anything to say, you can bring it up then.\u201dAlthough the truth was not what Cheng Mu thought it was, Qian Dui did contribute greatly to the rescue.Lunch was a must.However\u2026\u201cMaster Juan, has Qian Dui agreed to the meal?\u201d Cheng Mu recalled that when he was in the car when he came back, Qian Dui did not seem to care at all. \u201cJudging from how they look, it doesn\u2019t seem like they are people who would eat with others.\u201dCheng Juan, Cheng Mu, and several of them would definitely be restrained, and Qian Dui also did not talk much. How awkward would the atmosphere be?Although this was what he thought, Cheng Mu did not dare to say much.This time, he went to Yun Cheng with Hao Dui because of two reasons. The first was because of Cheng Juan and the second was because of Qian Dui. It was better to have this opportunity than none.**Three days later.At noon.Hao Dui and Cheng Mu were the first to arrive at the lunch.Cheng Juan and Lu Zhaoying were waiting for Qin Ran to be released from school and were not there yet.Cheng Juan had set a time that was just after Qin Ran\u2019s release from school.Cheng Mu and Hao Dui arrived in advance out of basic respect for Cheng Juan and Qian Dui.\u201cShe\u2019s really quite skilled, but will it be bad for her to come to this kind of business occasion?\u201d Cheng Mu held his teacup and glanced at the door. He said in a low voice to Hao Dui, \u201cWhat if Qian Dui is unhappy about it?\u201dCheng Mu thought that a high school student like Qin Ran was not suitable to attend such an occasion.He initially thought that Hao Dui would agree with him. Unexpectedly, Hao Dui only quietly drank his tea.He seemed to be deep in thought.Before Cheng Mu could say anything more, an attendant opened the door of their room and a few people walked in.When he looked up, he realized that it was Qian Dui. Cheng Mu\u2019s expression was obviously shocked.He originally thought that Qian Dui would arrive later with Cheng Juan.Generally, people who arrived at the lunch in advance did it either out of respect or because they wanted to chat with others.Seeing Qian Dui\u2019s expressionless and quiet face, he did not seem like someone who would engage in a conversation.\u201cQian Dui, what sort of tea would you like?\u201d Cheng Mu stood up and spoke first.\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Qian Dui said concisely.He sat on the seat next to the door. The two technicians behind him also saw down.Everyone sat down in silence. Besides Qian Dui who asked the attendant to bring over another pot of tea, no one else had any intention of speaking.The atmosphere suddenly turned chilly.Cheng Mu tried to ask Qian Dui and his team a few questions, but Qian Dui and his team only shook or nodded their heads like ice cubes.Cheng Mu felt extremely helpless. He thought that he was not a sociable person, but he did not expect that there would be someone who spoke less than him.He lowered his head and sent a WeChat message to Hao Dui. [Qian Dui is too cold. I can\u2019t work with him at all.]Just when the atmosphere was about to turn from awkward to freezing, the door was pushed open again.The person who opened the door was Lu Zhaoying. He touched his flashy earrings and leaned back to talk to the person behind him while opening the door.\u201cMaster Juan.\u201d Cheng Mu and Hao Dui both stood up.Cheng Juan lowered his eyes and acknowledged them with a slightly nasal voice. He walked in with Qin Ran.Cheng Mu was just about to sit down.However, he was shocked to see that Qian Dui and the others had also stood up. One of those people who were as cold as ice wiped the remaining chairs.Someone pulled the chairs out.With a faint smile on his face, Qian Dui poured a cup of tea and placed it in front of Qin Ran enthusiastically. \u201cYou can drink this tea. I just asked the attendant to bring over a new pot.\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As such, Cheng Juan sat down calmly and indifferently.Even though Lu Zhaoying had seen it, he continued to look at Qian Dui and his men and sighed secretly in his heart.Since everyone had arrived, Lu Zhaoying told the attendant to start serving the food. Qian Dui started to introduce the delicious dishes to Qin Ran in a low voice.He even ordered a large bowl of boiled meat slices for Qin Ran.Cheng Mu was speechless.He stiffened.Wasn\u2019t the lunch going to be cold and awkward?!The entire meal was not as awkward as he thought it would be. From the start to the end, Qian Dui and his men only chatted with Qin Ran and Lu Zhaoying.In fact, those people in Qian Dui\u2019s team kept giving toasts to Qin Ran.Looking at the lively atmosphere at the table, Cheng Juan leaned back on his chair. He had always been quiet and focused, but he slightly raised his eyebrows when he saw this scene.He stretched out his hand to knock the table and whispered something to the attendant.His hair drooped down to his side as he lowered his head and his hands that were placed on the table were long and slender.Within a few minutes, the wine beside Qin Ran\u2019s seat was replaced by juice for the attendant.The boiled meat slices placed in front of her were moved to the opposite side.Qian Dui was startled. He did not dare to look at Cheng Juan. At this time, he only looked up in confusion.Only then did Cheng Juan pick up his chopsticks, look up lazily, and explained, \u201cShe had a few stitches on her right hand and is recovering from a bad wound.\u201dSomething must have triggered Qian Dui because he suddenly sprung up and looked at Qin Ran worriedly. Even his voice was raised. \u201cHow many stitches did you get?! What happened to your hand?\u201dThe technicians that came with Qian Dui also put down their chopsticks and looked at Qin Ran solemnly.Qin Ran\u2019s chopsticks were gone before they even touched the boiled meat slices. She put them aside and glanced at Qian Dui speechlessly. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cHow can it be so easy to recover from a few stitches?!\u201d Qian Dui rambled on.Qin Ran was annoyed. She did not wish to explain and showed him her hand.There was only a pink scar and traces of stitches on her hand, but it was enough to tell how bad the injury was like in the past.Qian Dui continued frowning.Bam\u2014 He did not ask Qin Ran anything but slammed his chopsticks on the table.He looked up at Cheng Juan who was beside her and asked nervously, \u201cWhat condition is her hand in? Are there any side effects? Will there be any sequelae?\u201dWhen he first came to Yun Cheng, Cheng Mu accompanied Hao Dui to look for Qian Dui. The natural coldness of the other party made it hard to approach and talk to him.However, Qian Dui was rambling on like an old mother now. He did not seem like a cold and laconic man at all.Didn\u2019t she only hurt her right hand?Was it necessary to react like that and act as if she could not use her hands anymore?Cheng Juan was sitting at the table, but he could always be heard no matter how softly he spoke. Cheng Mu took out his cell phone and sent a WeChat message to Hao Dui.[Isn\u2019t she left-handed? It\u2019s not a big deal that her right hand is hurt. In the past, my goddess had a broken rib but still went with me to investigate a case and did not act like her.]For the remainder of the lunch, it was mostly Qian Dui and his team talking to Cheng Juan about Qin Ran\u2019s injury.He asked Cheng Juan thoroughly until he confirmed that her hands would not have any sequelae. Only then did he sigh in relief.After the meal was done, the person who spoke the most was Qian Dui. Before he left, he talked to Qin Ran for quite some time.Qian Dui and his men only unwillingly got on their car after Cheng Juan softly coughed.Cheng Mu stared numbly as Qian Dui got on the car.After Qian Dui had left, Cheng Mu could not help but look at Qin Ran. He just could not understand why Qian Dui looked like he knew Qin Ran so well. The awkward and cold scene he imagined did not happen at all.In contrast, he and Hao Dui barely said anything during lunch.Cheng Mu sat in the passenger\u2019s seat in a daze.Hao Dui started the car and turned back with a thoughtful look. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with Qian Dui\u2019s attitude. The way he treated Qin Ran\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to explain it.\u201dHao Dui did not need to say anything more. Cheng Mu also realized it.Both of them did not say anything for a moment.After that, Hao Dui jokingly said, \u201cHowever, how do you think Qin Ran compared to your goddess? Qin Ran\u2019s programming skills are not run of the mill.\u201dHao Dui did not really know much about computers, but he would never forget the way Qin Ran looked when she was using a computer a few days ago.Especially Qian Dui and his team\u2019s attitude.Since he mentioned it, Cheng Mu became emotional. \u201cShe\u2019s amazing, but how can she compare to my goddess?!\u201dHao Dui thought about it and did a serious comparison before nodding. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d**On the other hand, Qin Ran got off the car some distance away from school.She was about to go to class.However, she did not expect to see a black BMW at the intersection of the school.Five minutes later.Qin Ran sat in the passenger\u2019s seat.She leaned back in her chair and narrowed her eyes. She was relaxed but tried to sound serious. When she opened her mouth, her voice sounded dry. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? Tell me.\u201dNing Qing was seating in the back seat. After the chauffeur drove the car out of the school\u2019s gate, he promptly got out of the car.\u201cI\u2019ve already found out about what happened on Weibo. Don\u2019t be angry.\u201d After that, she changed the subject and said in a soft voice, \u201cRan Ran, why didn\u2019t you tell your mother that you knew Mr. Feng? It was Mr. Feng who solved the problem on Weibo for you, right? After such an esteemed person helped you, did you invite him for a meal?\u201dAlthough Yun Cheng was small, it housed many hidden talents.The Lin family appeared to be powerful on the surface, but in reality, it had a weak foundation. Many families were more impenetrable and some even belonged to the capital.Ning Qing also realized that in front of some families, there were some people in the Lin family\u2026 that were not worthy of being mentioned. Like Lin Wan who married into the Shen family in the capital.\u201cIt\u2019s ok. I don\u2019t know Mr. Feng very well.\u201d Qin Ran unknowingly covered her knees and said with a heavy tone.\u201cHow could you not know him well? He already helped you, inviting him to a meal is a must\u2026\u201d Ning Qing said.Qin Ran immediately interrupted her. \u201cRemember when you did not pick me up when I called you three years ago? Mr. Feng sent me back. I think he simply feels that I\u2019m pitiful because I don\u2019t even have his number.\u201dConsidering Feng Loucheng\u2019s status in Yun Cheng, he was extremely eye-catching. Qin Yu only needed to mention something in passing to Madam Feng before Lin Wan\u2019s attitude towards Ning Qing completely changed.Unexpectedly, Qin Ran did not even have Feng Loucheng\u2019s number.Ning Qing was very disappointed. If it were Qin Yu instead of Qin Ran, they would know Feng Loucheng\u2019s number three years ago. She would not be like Qin Ran, who was so old yet ignorant and self-important.Qin Ran pinched her own fingers, pushed the door open, and got out of the car.The chauffeur parked the car at the turn and there was an open space.Qin Ran just got off the car.In front of her, a beautiful Ferrari supercar drove over and stopped at Qin Ran\u2019s feet.Liked it?

As he took off his sunglasses and swept the area, he saw Qin Ran standing at the roadside and his eyes lit up.\u201cMiss Qin, do you remember me? I\u2019m Qian Jinyu.\u201d He acted friendly by waving his hand at Qin Ran and approached her. \u201cWe met last time at the clubhouse.\u201dQin Ran glanced at him without much care and her expression was quite indifferent. \u201cOh.\u201dAfter that, she turned around and wanted to walk back.Qian Jinyu did not expect Qin Ran to leave. He was startled and did not expect this reaction at all.He had met many women before. Most of the time, they would come closer once he stood by the car and waved at them.This was the first time he saw such a cold person.After recomposing himself, Qian Jinyu hurried over to Qin Ran again with a smile on his face.Ning Qing was quite disappointed in Qin Ran. She already gave her such an obvious reminder, but she refused to learn her lesson and was about to leave with flagging interest. Unexpectedly, another car stopped in front of Qin Ran.This car was not the same as the BMW she drove but a supercar.From Ning Qing\u2019s judgment, it was not cheap. Although many people in Yun Cheng could buy this car, very few bought it because not many people were willing to spend so much money on such a car.\u201cRan Ran.\u201d Ning Qing pushed the car door open. She raised her voice and walked to Qin Ran\u2019s side. \u201cIs this your friend?\u201dNing Qing\u2019s eyes swept past the sportscar quietly and finally fell on Qian Jinyu.He was attractive and looked distinguished.She knew a lot of people in the circle but never heard of any family with the surname \u201cQian\u201d.Qin Ran put her hands in her pockets and nonchalantly walked around Qian Jinyu again as she made her way towards school. Lowering her head, she looked cold and impatient but delicate.She was like a flame that set people\u2019s hearts on fire.Qian Jinyu initially wanted to stop her, but after he saw her expression, he was stunned.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d After verifying that she was a student of First Middle School, Qian Jinyu was not in a hurry anymore and turned to talk to Ning Qing.\u201cI\u2019m Ran Ran\u2019s mother\u2026\u201d Ning Qing smiled.**Qin Ran walked to Class 3.9 by herself.The afternoon self-study period was not over yet.Just as she walked in, Xu Yaoguang happened to walk out.Qin Ran turned slightly to give way to him. Xu Yaoguang looked very indifferent and did not even raise his eyebrows.He went to the office to get the papers.There was a physics quiz once a week, and the quizzes were getting harder and harder.When he arrived, Qin Yu was also there to collect the physics papers and had not left the office.\u201cThis physics paper is very hard.\u201d Qin Yu slightly raised her hand, tucked her hair behind her ear, and smiled. \u201cI only scored 81 marks. The last big question made me dumbfounded.\u201d100 was the total marks of the physics paper.Xu Yaoguang glanced at her. His expression rarely changed, but this time it did. \u201cGetting 80 marks and above is not bad already. We have similar scores.\u201dQin Yu laughed and it seemed that she had regained her momentum.\u201cI\u2019ll be rehearsing for the school celebration program on Friday evening.\u201d She watched Xu Yaoguang collect the papers and pursed her lips as if she spoke casually.Xu Yaoguang had always liked to watch her play the violin.Especially recently since he really liked her new song.Qin Yu kept him in anticipation and did not practice her violin in school recently.She assumed once he heard that she was going to rehearse, he would definitely not miss out on this opportunity.After some thought, he nodded slightly. \u201cOk. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d**Lin Siran was at her seat trying to do a physics problem. Beside her was a notebook that Qin Ran gave her. Recently, she liked to do physics problems when she was free.Qin Ran sat in the class and pulled out a book to read.\u201cRan Ran, the celebration is next Monday and the rehearsal is Friday evening. Do you want to watch our rehearsal?\u201d Lin Siran put down her pen and looked at Qin Ran hopefully.As Qin Ran flipped the pages of her book, she glanced at her and slowly responded. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201dShe did not confirm her attendance nor reject her. Lin Siran was quite happy about it.Qin Ran leaned back on her chair, placed her hand on her chin, narrowed her eyes, and thought about it casually. Perhaps she should make some time on Friday night.Xu Yaoguang came back and gave out the physics papers.The papers were rolled up by their physics teacher. On the way back, he talked to Qin Yu and even discussed a physics question with her. He did not have time to look at his paper, but he had already estimated his score.He only opened his paper once he reached his class.The physics teacher had a habit of arranging the physics papers from the lowest to highest scores.Naturally, the first one was Qin Ran\u2019s.Xu Yaoguang looked down and saw that she scored 38 marks.This time, the physics paper was difficult and there were a few papers that had around 40 marks. 38 marks did not seem that jarring.However, this score could not help but stir Xu Yaoguang\u2019s emotions.He directly handed out the papers starting from Qin Ran and then continued with the rest.When the period bell rang, the self-study session was over and the students in the class started to move around. Qiao Sheng received his paper and went to compare it with Qin Ran\u2019s.But before he could make a comparison, he saw Xu Yaoguang coming over with Lin Siran\u2019s paper quietly with a strange expression.No one else knew, but Qiao Sheng was very clear on this. Xu Yaoguang was only interested in two things.One was the violin.The second was physics.That was why he chose to be the representative of the physics class even though his math was very good.Coincidentally, Qin Yu was good at both.Looking at Xu Yaoguang\u2019s expression, he was a little startled. \u201cYoung Master Xu, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dLiked it?

There were a few challenging questions spread throughout the paper and those who could score 80 marks and above were those godly students who had participated in the physics competition last year, not to mention people who scored 90 marks and above.However, these people did not include Lin Siran.Everyone knew that Lin Siran was good at languages and biology but was bad at other subjects, especially math and physics. That was why she could never be in the top five in the class.Right now, she actually scored 10 more marks higher than Xu Yaoguang?Even Qiao Sheng, who had very poor grades, could not help but look at Lin Siran incredulously.Lin Siran was a little dumbfounded. She lowered her head and flipped through her paper. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d She did feel that she did the paper quite proficiently but did not expect to only be wrong for a small subsection of the last killer question.Xu Yaoguang glanced at her, thought for a while, and asked politely, \u201cHow did you do the last question? Can you let me see your paper?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dWhen she handed her paper to Xu Yaoguang, Lin Siran suddenly thought of something and turned around to look at Qin Ran.Qin Ran was lazily sitting on her seat casually flipping through a book and sucking on a lollipop.Lin Siran blinked as if she suddenly remembered something. \u201cI saw the last question in my notebook before.\u201dShe passed the notebook Qin Ran gave her to Xu Yaoguang.Xu Yaoguang took it and opened it. On the first page, he saw three words scribbled on it. Although they were messy, Xu Yaoguang could still pick them out.\u201cSong Luting.\u201d Xu Yaoguang whispered word by word.Qiao Sheng also turned around to take a closer look and then glanced at Lin Siran. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of this person before. Is this person from our school?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Xu Yaoguang turned to the next page and was deep in thought as he scrutinized it. \u201cHe\u2019s one year older than us.\u201dHe lifted his head to look at Lin Siran with shining eyes. \u201cDo you know Song Luting?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Lin Siran shook her head. Instinctively, she looked at Qin Ran and bit her lip.Without Qin Ran\u2019s approval, she did not dare to say anything to Xu Yaoguang.Xu Yaoguang followed her gaze and looked at Qin Ran. A ray of light flashed past his eyes, but it disappeared the next moment.He borrowed Lin Siran\u2019s physics paper and went back to his seat.Qiao Sheng did not notice this. He returned the paper to Qin Ran and went back to his seat. He then stretched his legs and noisily asked, \u201cYoung Master Xu, who is Song Luting?\u201d\u201cThe champion of IPHO last July. He\u2019s from Yun Cheng,\u201d Xu Yaoguang softly said.IPHO stood for International Physics Olympiad.Xu Yaoguang thought about whether these two people just had the same name, but after flipping through the notebook, he felt that the probability was small.\u201cHow did Lin Siran get to know such a godly person?\u201d Qiao Sheng was quite surprised.Xu Yaoguang did not say much, but he unknowingly glanced at Qin Ran.**Friday, noon.The scars on Qin Ran\u2019s hand gradually disappeared. Now, she was sitting in the school doctor\u2019s office and doing her homework.Cheng Mu silently poured a glass of water for her and asked carefully, \u201cMiss Qin, do you want to eat something?\u201dHe had a very respectful attitude.Although Cheng Mu did not speak in the past or show his true feelings in front of Qin Ran, he was extremely dissatisfied with her deep inside.At this time, there was a clear difference in attitude.Qin Ran was sitting crossed-legged. She turned over a page, lifted her pen to write something, and replied casually, \u201cNo.\u201dCheng Mu immediately stepped aside to avoid disturbing her.Due to the rehearsal program, there were no lessons in the afternoon. Qin Ran did school practices for two hours before starting to pack her things.Cheng Juan half-leaned on the sofa as he spoke to Lu Zhaoying in a soft voice. Neither of them looked very pleasant.Qin Ran was doing her exercises at a table not far away from them. Today, she wore a school uniform coat and a red and black checkered T-shirt. She occasionally frowned but looked lively overall.Sometimes, when they glanced at her, she seemed quite cheerful.This made the atmosphere of the school doctor\u2019s office very relaxed.Cheng Juan, who had been paying attention to this, squinted as he looked at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you have lessons this afternoon?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a rehearsal. Lin Siran wants me to watch their performance.\u201d After packing her things, Qin Ran stood up. \u201cIt won\u2019t take too long. I\u2019ll be back in half an hour.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Only then did Cheng Juan nod and respond slowly. He leaned back again and his eyes fell on her right hand. \u201cDon\u2019t do too much hard work for them. Even though your hand is fine, you need two weeks of rest.\u201dQin Ran did not turn back. She only waved in passing as she left.Lu Zhaoying could not help but laugh. \u201cWhat a cold girl!\u201dLu Zhaoying paused, grabbed a pen, and look at Cheng Juan again. After some thought, he asked again, \u201cMaster Juan, Qin Ran could move her hand long ago. Why are you so worried?\u201dCheng Mu nodded ferociously in his heart.Not to mention, she was left-handed. Furthermore, even if she was not left-handed, her scars were about to disappear soon.Cheng Juan glanced at the two of them with a calm expression. Even his tone was lax. \u201cDo you know why I am Master Juan and you two aren\u2019t?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d The two of them asked instinctively.\u201cThat\u2019s because your IQ is low.\u201d Cheng Juan held the file holder with his long fingers and said politely.Both of them were speechless.**First Middle School\u2019s hall.The hall was very big and could accommodate about a thousand people.It was so noisy, it was as if there was a guard of honor conducting a ceremony in her head.When Qin Ran entered the hall, she felt very tensed and her entire body felt like it was in low atmospheric pressure.Just as she was about to take out her phone to look for Lin Siran, Qiao Sheng patted her shoulder with his phone. As the hall was very noisy, he instinctively raised his voice. \u201cLin Siran and the others are still in the line. She asked me to take you to the small hall.\u201dAfter knowing each other for a long time, he and Lin Siran knew that Qin Ran was afraid of noisy places. She would turn cold when there were many people.The small hall was separated by a door.Under normal circumstances, there were few people inside. At this time, Qin Yu was authorized to practice her violin in it.When Qin Ran went in, Qin Yu was not practicing a new song but her performance song.After listening to more new songs, Qin Yu\u2019s performances had been dull for a long time.Xu Yaoguang listened to her very seriously. When Qin Ran walked in, he subconsciously looked at her.Qiao Sheng whispered to him and Xu Yaoguang responded softly. He was now distracted and not paying as much attention to the violin as before.Qin Yu\u2019s expression darkened as she had always been paying attention to Xu Yaoguang\u2019s reaction.Qin Yu\u2019s violin playing was not bad and was more advanced than the average violinist.\u201cQin Yu is not bad and her playing is quite nice.\u201d Qiao Sheng whispered in her ear.Qin Ran acknowledged him. \u201cShe\u2019s still on the amateur side, but she truly has potential.\u201dXu Yaoguang saw that Qiao Sheng and Qin Ran seemed to be paying attention to her playing and could not help but whisper. \u201cShe\u2019s playing double harmonics now. There are not many people her age who can do that\u2026\u201dQiao Sheng was not really focused and scratched his head. \u201cI think it\u2019s not much different from what she was playing just now.\u201dQin Ran also casually remarked. \u201cIt\u2019s average. Not smooth enough.\u201dQin Yu heard Qin Ran and Qiao Sheng\u2019s words just after she stopped and pursed her lips. Finally, she could no longer hold it in. \u201cDo you understand what is double harmonics or left-hand pizzicato? How about you two understand these terms before criticizing my playing? I don\u2019t need amateurs to evaluate my playing. Young Master Xu, they are so noisy that I can\u2019t concentrate. Please ask them to leave immediately.\u201dLiked it?

    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: Numbered Musical NotationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas StudiosWasn\u2019t it just double harmonics and left-hand pizzicato?Didn\u2019t double harmonics mean that the bow was floating on the surface of the strings instead of pressing down on them? The positions for the correct notes had to be precise to ensure that the notes were in tune and there was sufficient control over the string vibration.As for the left-hand pizzicato technique, it was more difficult than double harmonics. However, anyone who knew a little bit about the violin knew of this technique.Did she have to take so much pride in knowing those terms?The key reasons why Qin Ran said that was not these, but because Qin Yu was not proficient in double harmonics and left-hand string pizzicato. Her double harmonics were very stiff and sometimes, she went out of tune. The way her left hand pressed on the strings was quite sluggish sometimes and it made the vibrato very choppy.The problem with her left-hand pizzicato was even bigger. Whenever Qin Yu plucked the D string, it always sounded dull because she did not dare to use enough force. Qin Ran guessed that Qin Yu tried before. If the sound was too clear she wound definitely hit the E string.In any case, Qin Yu\u2019s foundation was solid, but her skills now were not good enough.However, Qin Yu wanted to show off her skills in this piece of music, which caused its beauty to be ruined.This was the reason Qin Ran said her playing was not smooth.However, she did not say that out loud.She only took out her earpieces and stuffed them into her ears. She found a stood to sit down on, turned up the volume to the maximum, and her entire body started to relax slowly.Due to what Qin Yu said, the atmosphere in the small hall became tense.Qiao Sheng hid his careless expression, turned around, and looked at Qin Yu with a slight sneer.Qin Yu did not dare to look at Qiao Sheng. She dug her nails into the palm of her hand and slightly closed her eyes before speaking to Xu Yaoguang. \u201cSo are you just going to let her be here?\u201dXu Yaoguang returned to his senses. He looked at Qin Ran with a cold and intense gaze. After that, he turned over to talk to Qin Yu. \u201cAs a violinist, you will be subjected to various comments by professionals and amateurs. You don\u2019t have to worry about them.\u201d\u201cBut what if I say that her being here is really affecting my mood? I\u2019m unable to continue playing.\u201d Qin Yu spoke lightly without looking at Qin Ran.Xu Yaoguang did not immediately answer. He thought about it for a moment.After that, he looked at Qin Ran with an obvious intention.Finally, Qin Yu breathed a sigh of relief. She looked down from a platform at Qin Ran who was sitting down.Qiao Sheng opened his mouth, jumped up, and said incredulously, \u201cYoung Master Xu?!\u201dXu Yaoguang did not say anything.The cell phone in Qin Ran\u2019s hand vibrated. Lin Siran had called her, so she answered it.It was time for Lin Siran\u2019s performance.Qin Ran stood up, took off her earpieces, and stuffed them in her pocket. Her apricot shaped eyes squinted as she said indifferently to Qiao Sheng, \u201cIt\u2019s Lin Siran\u2019s turn. Let\u2019s go.\u201dQiao Sheng looked at Qin Yu with a slight smile, but his gaze was icy. After that, he followed Qin Ran and left the small hall.After the two of them left, the small hall was quiet again.Xu Yaoguang\u2019s expression did not change much. He continued to look at Qin Yu indifferently. \u201cThey\u2019re gone. You can continue.\u201dJust after Qin Yu picked up her violin, Xu Yaoguang\u2019s voice rang again. \u201cDoes your sister know how to play the violin?\u201dIt was a question, but he said it with an affirmative tone.\u201cShe learned it before when she was younger, but she wasn\u2019t serious. After a few years, she quit and even hit her teacher\u2019s child\u2019s head,\u201d Qin Yu said.Xu Yaoguang nodded and did not say anything else.His eyes were somewhat empty. Later, Qin Yu noticed that he was not listening as seriously as before.**Outside, Qin Ran already saw Lin Siran. She was behind the ones performing in the Ninth Class.\u201cWhat are you thinking about? The big troops are all gone.\u201d Qin Ran cleared her throat and softly whispered.\u201cI seem to recognize someone familiar.\u201d Lin Siran frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not very sure.\u201dLin Siran returned to her senses and took out a small glass bottle that was the size of her thumb. There was a small plant inside. She handed it to Qin Ran. \u201cTake this.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Qiao Sheng turned over to look at them.Lin Siran smiled breezily. \u201cIt\u2019s a blade of grass. Nothing much.\u201dAfter hearing Lin Siran\u2019s explanation, Qin Ran looked at her expressionlessly.Qiao Sheng did not care much about Qin Ran\u2019s expression. He only looked at it seriously, realized that it was really a blade of grass, and did not say anything more.Girls were really lame.**At night, after Qin Yu was done practicing, she went home with a lot of thoughts in her mind.Ning Qing was on a call with someone at home and she looked very happy.Qin Yu sat on the sofa and did not practice her piano. While she waited for Ning Qing to be done with her phone call, she fixed her hair and casually said, \u201cMom, where did you find that piece of paper last time?\u201dNing Qing hung up the phone and was startled. \u201cWhat piece of paper?\u201dQin Yu pursed her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 the piece of paper that dropped out when you were packing grandma\u2019s stuff.\u201dNing Qing thought about it for a long time and only had a vague impression of it. \u201cPaper? It must be something that belongs to your grandma, right? I\u2019m not sure. You can come with me to visit your grandma tomorrow and ask her.\u201dChen Shulan?Qin Yu\u2019s impression of Chen Shulan was of an old person that dressed plainly. She did not know Chen Shulan very well.However, the musicality and skill of this piece were very profound. Qin Yu guessed that it probably had little to do with Chen Shulan. She just did not know where she got it from.She nodded slightly. \u201cI will visit grandma with you tomorrow.\u201dQin Yu realized that Xu Yaoguang was more interested in her adapted piece than her other pieces, but she only had one page of the music score.However, Qin Yu did not associate the score with Chen Shulan. She only decided to try her luck.**The next day, Qin Yu went to see Chen Shulan with Ning Qing.\u201cMom, Yu\u2019er is here to see you.\u201d Ning Qing shook Chen Shulan awake from her bed.Chen Shulan was very sick and her mental state was not good. Even her voice was weak.Qin Yu sat on a chair by her bed instead of sitting on the bed. She greeted Chen Shulan with a few words of concern. In the end, just before they left, she covered Chen Shulan with a blanket and said, \u201cOh yes, grandma, the last time when my mom helped you organize your luggage, I saw a piece of paper with many symbols on it.\u201dQin Yu was afraid that Chen Shulan did not understand musical notations and phrased it differently.\u201cDo you have more of it?\u201dWhen Chen Shulan spoke, she always seemed to be in a frail state and did not say much to Qin Yu. However, when she heard this sentence, she looked refreshed and her eyes lit up as she stared at her.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When she came in, she saw how pale Qin Yu\u2019s face was as if she had suffered a blow, and she glanced at Chen Shulan subconsciously.Chen Shulan laid sickly in bed, her eyes slightly closed, looking very tired.Ning Qing was afraid of disturbing Chen Shulan\u2019s rest, so she went out directly with Qin Yu.Once the two of them were outside, Mu Ying and Ning Wei came upstairs.Qin Ran held her phone and followed not far away.\u201cSecond Cousin, you\u2019re here to see grandma too.\u201d Mu Ying walked forward and smiled at Qin Yu.Qin Yu greeted them and stayed silent.\u201cMom, Second Cousin is going to play the violin during our school celebration.\u201d Recently, almost everyone in school was excited over the school celebration, especially the group of freshmen like Mu Ying. \u201cSecond Cousin is even the finale performance.\u201dRecently, the school had mentioned Qin Yu\u2019s violin more frequently, and everyone\u2019s attention had turned gradually to the campus belle of class 3.1 who was not only studious, had a good family background, and was also good looking.\u201cYeah, Yu\u2019er has a celebration, but my mother\u2019s body isn\u2019t good, so I won\u2019t let her go. Do you guys have time? I\u2019ll let Yu\u2019er take a few more tickets\u2014she\u2019s in the student union.\u201d At the mention of Qin Yu, Ning Qing\u2019s smile widened and her voice became a few pitches higher subconsciously.Ning Wei paused and said she still had work to do.But Mu Ying said in surprise, \u201cThen, thank you, Aunt. Many people in our class don\u2019t have tickets.\u201dThere were nearly a thousand people in the first grade of First Middle School. Coupled with the parents and school teachers, the students only had a few tickets left.While they talked, Qin Yu held her phone and headed towards the ward without raising her head.Ning Qing stared at Qin Ran\u2019s back and didn\u2019t even want to nag at her anymore. She had always been like this since young\u2014antisocial and rarely playing with others.Chen Shulan had said she had matured earlier, but Ning Qing was simply speechless. She clearly just had a low EQ and personality problems.\u201cYu\u2019er, go back first.\u201d Ning Qing thought of something and didn\u2019t go back with Qin Yu.Qin Yu nodded. Her heart was heavy, but she didn\u2019t say anything.Mu Ying helped Qin Yu press the elevator button.**In the ward.Qin Ran sat on the stool and cut apples for Chen Shulan.Chen Shulan opened her eyes and leaned on the pillow behind her. \u201cRan Ran, did you bring back the music sheets I brought back for you last time?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in my box.\u201d Qin Ran lowered her head and cut the apples seriously. Her clean face tilted slightly and she raised her eyebrow. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t throw it away.\u201d\u201cThen keep it well.\u201d Chen Shulan smiled, then coughed again lightly.Qin Ran stared at Chen Shulan and frowned. \u201cI originally wanted to throw it away, anyway. It\u2019s garbage, but you still picked it up.\u201d\u201cYou treat it as rubbish, but someone still misses it\u2026\u201d Chen Shulan raised her eyebrows, and when she saw Ning Qing coming in, she stopped talking and asked Qin Ran about her studies.Qin Ran told her honestly about her Physics results.Ning Qing heard \u201c30 points\u201d as soon as she came in.Ning Qing wasn\u2019t clear about her other scores, but she remembered the Physics score. Qin Yu had told Lin Jinxuan just a few days back.She heard that this Physics exam was very difficult. Qin Yu had gotten 82 points and was third in school.Even Lin Jinxuan, who seldom talked, had praised Qin Yu.Ning Qing didn\u2019t speak when she heard Chen Shulan praising her improvement and didn\u2019t feel bothered.**Qin Ran didn\u2019t have other matters, so she accompanied Chen Shulan for three hours every Saturday.Ning Qing waited for her to leave before coming out with her.\u201cRan Ran, wait for me.\u201d Ning Qing called, her face as gentle as possible.Qin Ran reached out to press the elevator and narrowed her eyes, her face expressionless. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dHer style had always been carefree and unbridled, and she was even more casual with people she didn\u2019t care about.Her beautiful eyes were impatient\u2014Ning Qing hated the look.Her attitude put Ning Qing in a bad mood, but she still smiled patiently. \u201cDo you remember that Young Master Qian from last time? He\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cStop.\u201d Qin Ran could see Ning Qing\u2019s thoughts at a glance. She stared at Ning Qing, her eyes cold. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me who he is, I have nothing to do with him. Why don\u2019t you go and sell Qin Yu instead?\u201dThe elevator door opened with a \u201cding\u201d.She went straight in.Ning Qing reached out to block the door and pursed her lips. \u201cI\u2019m also doing it for you! That Young Master Qian has a solid background and I\u2019ve also heard that he\u2019s the Chairman of a corporation. You\u2019re considered lucky that he has taken a fancy on you, you should count your blessings.\u201dQin Ran laughed, her eyes cold. \u201cSince his qualification is so good, let Qin Yu marry him.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about, your sister\u2026\u201d Ning Qing opened her mouth.Qin Yu had been molded by her personally and was comparable to all those noble ladies in all aspects. Furthermore, Lin Wan also liked Qin Yu, so Qin Yu\u2019s marriage would definitely be in Beijing.After being in the high society, Ning Qing knew that she was nothing more than a small wave in this circle.Although that Young Master Qian was good, he was too dissolute and didn\u2019t have any personal achievements. He wasn\u2019t comparable to Lin Jinxuan and Feng Ci, so Ning Qing wasn\u2019t willing to let Qin Yu marry this kind of person.But Qin Ran was different. Other than her face, she wasn\u2019t outstanding. She didn\u2019t have good grades, nor was she from a good family, and Ning Qing really felt like she was quite ignorant of current affairs.\u201cIf you can\u2019t explain yourself, then let it go.\u201d**Qin Ran returned directly to the bubble tea shop.She had taken leave because of her hand injury previously. The boss wasn\u2019t usually so lenient towards the part-time workers, but Qin Ran was different. When she worked in the bubble tea shop, the business boomed several times more than usual and the line snaked all the way to the streets.Be it from their own school or from another school, they were all there to see her face.So the bubble tea shop\u2019s boss was extremely happy to see Qin Ran.\u201cQin Ran went to the bubble tea shop again?\u201d Lu Zhaoying, who was sitting at the passenger seat, saw the grandeur of the bubble tea shop and couldn\u2019t help laughing.He looked at the rearview mirror and saw that Cheng Juan\u2019s expression was a little solemn.Lu Zhaoying and the others already thought that Qin Ran\u2019s hand was fine. After all, the scar had faded.But Cheng Juan still didn\u2019t allow Qin Ran to do anything, nor did he let her enter the kitchen. All the tasks were handed to Cheng Mu, and with his life-savior around, Cheng Mu did all the work earnestly.Cheng Juan had taken care of everything only for her to run to the bubble tea shop by herself.\u201cDoes she lack money?\u201d Lu Zhaoying thought for a while. \u201cShould we hire Qin Ran as our technician? Her skills are definitely good.\u201dCheng Juan lowered his head and didn\u2019t speak.Cheng Mu glanced at Lu Zhaoying and was shocked. He didn\u2019t expect Lu Zhaoying to trust Qin Ran so much that he actually wanted to hire her as an internal staff without even going through a screening test?He looked at Cheng Juan, and he seemed to actually be seriously considering it?Cheng Juan lowered his eyes and his forehead drooped naturally. He squinted his dark eyes and wanted to go in and drag the girl out. He wanted to tell her there was no need to do this for money.But\u2026Cheng Juan said in low spirits, \u201cLet\u2019s go first.\u201dLu Zhaoying and Cheng Mu sensed his bad mood and didn\u2019t dare to say anything.**In the Lin family\u2019s house.Ning Qing went back, and her mood was obviously not good.While having dinner, Qin Yu came out and noticed that Ning Qing was calling someone. She couldn\u2019t hear clearly, but she heard the words \u201cYoung Master Qian\u201d.Qin Yu\u2019s eyes glanced over, and she probably knew something.Aunt Zhang served a bowl of fruits to Qin Yu. \u201cMiss, this is the fruit that Sir just brought back. It\u2019s fresh, you should eat it first.\u201dQin Yu ate one grape and looked towards Ning Qing. \u201cWho is my mother calling?\u201dAunt Zhang smiled and didn\u2019t seem bothered. \u201cShe called him for your sister. A young man called Young Master Qian has taken a fancy to her.\u201d\u201cYun Cheng?\u201d Qin Yu\u2019s eyes rolled and she pursed her lips. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anyone with the surname Qian in Yun Cheng\u2026\u201d\u201cThis kind of small family can\u2019t be compared to the Feng family, but for your sister, it\u2019s indeed rare,\u201d Aunt Zhang said.Qin Yu naturally knew this. If this Young Master Qian was from a big family, she definitely wouldn\u2019t pull her strings. \u201cIt\u2019s indeed rare.\u201dFrom Qin Yu\u2019s current perspective, Qin Ran wouldn\u2019t have any development in the future.Although Qiao Sheng was close to her, how could the Qiao family possibly take a rural girl as their daughter-in-law?She was considered lucky to be able to marry into the Qian family.Qin Yu wasn\u2019t concerned about Qin Ran\u2019s matter anymore.Until the evening when Lin Qi came back and he suddenly mentioned Qin Ran.\u201cRan Ran knows Chairman Feng?\u201d Lin Qi glanced at Ning Qing.Ning Qing was stunned. \u201cWho is Chairman Feng?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s the Chairman of the Feng Corporation.\u201d Lin Jinxuan picked up a piece of vegetable and explained, \u201cShe\u2019s the younger sister of Feng Loucheng. They\u2019re both in politics and business and their main business is in Beijing. Their business is very big and out of the ordinary.\u201dQin Yu raised her head at the mention of Qin Ran.She was in disbelief. \u201cThen, Sister knows Chairman Feng?\u201dShe and Ning Qing didn\u2019t know.However, her family was in Beijing and she was also Feng Loucheng\u2019s sister, so how could she and Ning Qing have gotten in touch with her?\u201cI heard Chairman Feng mention it at a banquet today. Chairman Feng was inquiring for her son.\u201d Lin Qi also paused and then said, \u201cHer son is more low-key and follows his Father\u2019s surname, Qian.\u201dBam\u2014The chopsticks in Qin Yu\u2019s hand fell on the table.Liked it?

You have probably seen him before, he\u2019s Qian Jinyu.\u201dQin Yu glanced over at Ning Qing, who was frozen on the chair.At the mention of this, Lin Jinxuan frowned and lowered his chopsticks. \u201cDad, Chairman Feng was asking about Ran Ran for her son?\u201dLin Jinxuan nodded slightly and understood Lin Jinxuan\u2019s concern. \u201cI know how to deal with this matter, you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dThe people on the table were all distracted.Lin Qi could see that Ning Qing was acting a little strange.After dinner, he got up and said solemnly to Ning Qing, \u201cCome to the study with me.\u201d**Qin Yu returned to the violin room after dinner.However, she was distracted about Qian Jinyu\u2019s matter and felt a little angry.When she\u2019d thought that she had never heard of the surname \u201cQian\u201d in Yun Cheng before, she hadn\u2019t meddled with the affairs. Who knew that this random person would actually be related to Feng Loucheng.And he seemed to be from Beijing.She was very upset and vexed.How was Qin Ran so lucky to be able to randomly find a low-key Young Master Qian whose identity was also comparable to Feng Ci?Qin Yu was sullen and also unspeakably jealous.The phone in her pocket rang.She looked down at the phone number and it wasn\u2019t from the city.\u201cHello, Dad?\u201d Qin Yu frowned, but her voice was obedient. \u201cYou\u2019re coming to Yun Cheng in two days and want to see me? Okay, I\u2019ll see you in our usual spot.\u201dThen, she hung up.**Cheng Juan invited Qian Dui over for dinner.He had come to Yun Cheng with a mission.Although Qian Dui was arrogant and cold, he had probably been warned by some people before coming, for his attitude towards Cheng Juan was rather good. Even though he didn\u2019t speak much, there was obvious respect in his voice.But Cheng Juan sat on the chair lazily without a word.His lowered eyebrows were thick and heavy and looked very gentle but imposing. Qian Dui didn\u2019t dare to take the initiative to talk to him.Lu Zhaoying was the one communicating with Qian Dui.Hao Dui sat with Cheng Mu at the side and waited for Lu Zhaoying to finish talking before Cheng Mu spoke to Qian Dui. \u201cQian Dui, did you know Qin\u2026 Ms. Qin before?\u201dQian Dui had always been cold and often ignored people, but his eyes lit up at the mention of Qin Ran.\u201cYes,\u201d he said concisely.But at least he didn\u2019t ignore him.Cheng Mu was overwhelmed. \u201cDo you know what Ms. Qin likes? What are her hobbies\u2026\u201dHe asked several questions in a row.He had thought that Qian Dui would only answer with a few casual words or ignore him directly because he had experienced Qian Dui\u2019s coldness before.He didn\u2019t expect Qian Dui to answer him very carefully.\u201cMs. Qin likes quiet places. She seems rather cold but is actually a very nice person. She likes to eat\u2026\u201d Qian Dui was extremely eloquent at the mention of Qin Ran.He seemed like an old mother of hers.Cheng Mu took out the notebook he always carried and noted down everything that Qian Dui said.After dinner, Cheng Juan should have left, but when he heard these two people talking, he sat down again, leaned on the back of the chair, and narrowed his eyes.He tapped his slender fingers on the table distractedly, seeming to listen very intently.Lu Zhaoying was about to go, but when he saw Cheng Juan sit down again, he raised an eyebrow and sat down with a smile.Qian Dui finally stopped talking and seemed to like Cheng Mu a little more.Before he left, he specially greeted Cheng Mu.Cheng Mu really felt flattered.\u201cWhy did you ask about Qin Ran from Qian Dui?\u201d Hao Dui was very surprised. After all, Cheng Mu was like him before and didn\u2019t like Qin Ran very much.And Cheng Mu was just like his name, so boring and moody.Besides Cheng Juan and his goddess, Hao Dui had never seen Cheng Mu so concerned about anyone else.Many people in Beijing had tried to curry favor with him to no avail.But he was actually asking about Qin Ran\u2019s preferences?\u201cMs. Qin is my life savior,\u201d Cheng Mu followed behind Cheng Juan and muttered.Cheng Mu didn\u2019t like to express himself much, but he wasn\u2019t stupid. He could naturally tell Cheng Juan and Lu Zhaoying\u2019s favor towards Qin Ran.Hao Dui took out the cigarette in his mouth and leaned towards Cheng Mu, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re so concerned about her, then what about your goddess?\u201dCheng Mu didn\u2019t even think before answering naturally, \u201cMy goddess is naturally the first.\u201d**On Monday.The whole school was on holiday and the celebration started at two in the afternoon.Qin Ran crouched in the school doctor\u2019s office in the morning.The school was so chaotic that Lu Zhaoying and the others all knew about it.\u201cQin Ran, are you all celebrating today?\u201d Lu Zhaoying was on holiday today and didn\u2019t wear a white coat. He wore a casual T-shirt and was lying on Qin Ran\u2019s desk as he asked with a smile.Qin Ran supported her chin with one hand and replied lazily, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen what is your program?\u201d Lu Zhaoying wasn\u2019t interested in what the other kids were doing, and he didn\u2019t even look at the concert tickets that some people had given him.But he would be interested if Qin Ran was to perform a chorus or anything of the sort.\u201cNo.\u201d Qin Ran picked up the milk on the side, poked a straw, and took a sip. \u201cI\u2019m just going to watch my class perform a chorus.\u201dLu Zhaoying wasn\u2019t surprised. After all, with Qin Ran\u2019s personality, she didn\u2019t seem too likely to join the chorus.She usually frowned when there were too many people, and her brain would probably explode if she had to sing along in a chorus.\u201cGive me a message when you finish reading.\u201d Cheng Juan slowly turned a piece of paper and raised his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s go eat dinner at night, Qian Dui is treating us.\u201dLast time, Cheng Mu and the others had treated Qian Dui, so this time, Qian Dui wanted to treat Qin Ran and Cheng Juan.Qin Ran responded and didn\u2019t expect a good meal.No matter where it was, it would just be boiled cabbage.\u201cThe chorus is in the backcourt, you can come out at five o\u2019clock.\u201d Qin Ran was expressionless. \u201cContact me then.\u201dAfter lunch, it was two o\u2019clock.Qiao Sheng gave Qin Ran a phone call outside the school gate.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go first.\u201d Qin Ran put down her pen and kept her exercise book.Lu Zhaoying greeted Qiao Sheng very enthusiastically.Cheng Juan didn\u2019t look like he was about to greet him, and he just looked up and glanced at Qiao Sheng. He was also concise to Qin Ran and said, \u201cYeah.\u201dQin Ran took her headphones and went out.Cheng Juan glanced at Qiao Sheng in the school doctor\u2019s office. Although Qiao Sheng was talking to Qin Ran, it was obvious that he was two steps behind her.He looked away.**Outside the door of the school doctor\u2019s office, Qiao Sheng was a little afraid.\u201cYou know the people in the school doctor\u2019s office?\u201d Qiao Sheng asked in a low voice.With the sun above his head, Qin Ran put on a peaked cap and said lazily, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a part-timer there.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re not that familiar with them?\u201d Qiao Sheng sighed in relief. \u201cAnyway, you shouldn\u2019t get too close to the people in the school doctor\u2019s office. Young Master Xu told me that they\u2026 anyway, just don\u2019t get too close.\u201dThe original words of Xu Yaoguang to Qiao Sheng was to stay far away from the people in the school doctor\u2019s office, or he might die an unknown death.When Qiao Sheng had asked again, Xu Yaoguang wouldn\u2019t say anything, but this didn\u2019t hinder Qiao Sheng\u2019s conjecture.He knew Xu Yaoguang\u2019s identity.Qin Ran pressed her hat down and said perfunctorily, \u201cOh.\u201dQiao Sheng still wanted to talk, but they met Lin Siran and Xia Fei and he quickly closed his mouth.**A shaded place in school.\u201cYu\u2019er, I have to work later, and I\u2019m returning to Ninghai Town tomorrow.\u201d Qin Hanqiu took out a wad of money from his pocket. \u201cThis is pocket money for you, keep it.\u201dQin Hanqiu had always liked this obedient daughter.Although he now had a young son, he was still as concerned about Qin Yu, or he wouldn\u2019t have wanted to bring her back.He worked at a log factory and smelled of wood chips.He was sweaty all over.Qin Yu naturally didn\u2019t want it and said softly, \u201cDad, this is your hard-earned money, how could I keep it? I don\u2019t need pocket money in the Lin family, anyway. You should give it to my brother and aunt.\u201dQin Hanqiu always found an opportunity to visit Qin Yu every year, and she never kept the money he gave her and would ask him to give it to her brother.Qin Hanqiu always felt like this daughter was so sweet and considerate.He would find a chance to see Qin Yu whenever he was in Yun Cheng.Not far away, a group of people was talking.Qin Hanqiu turned around quickly. \u201cSure. You have a performance, right? Go on now.\u201dHe also didn\u2019t want Qin Yu\u2019s classmates to know that she had a father like him.Qin Yu said a few intimate words and heard that the group of people was approaching, so she turned and left.Qin Hanqiu stared at her back and was very happy at the thought that she was going to perform on stage later.He turned and walked towards the road.But then he saw Qin Ran in the crowd.Qin Ran\u2019s personality was quite like his\u2014a little unsociable.Qin Hanqiu hadn\u2019t seen Qin Ran for a long time and suddenly reacted after seeing her that she had already come to Yun Cheng with Ning Qing.\u201cQin\u2026\u201d He looked at her with some joy.He had wanted to say hello but found that several people were around Qin Ran. The clothes on the teenager\u2019s body beside her were valuable at a glance and the other people around her were also bright and neat.Everyone seemed happy and excited.Qin Hanqiu reacted suddenly and immediately swallowed his words. Then, he turned and walked into the words.Qin Ran naturally saw Qin Hanqiu and was stunned by his reaction. \u201cDad, why did you run away when you saw me?\u201dLiked it?
