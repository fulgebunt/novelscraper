You\u2019re my only husband.\u201dHis blue eyes shook greatly at her affectionate words, as if he wanted to believe those words.

Her consciousness was on the verge of slipping out and her legs kept on trembling pitifully.But the muscular hands that stretched out from behind her, were unwilling to let her rest. The man grabbed her voluminous butt and hoisted it up. As he did that, his waist shook more intensely.The thing that hit her deeply inside, was very hard and heavy and there was a lot of sticky fluid between her legs. He had already been driving her for hours without getting tired.\u201cHmm, hmm, now stop, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d Annette sobbed and begged. She was very exhausted.With her long blond hair dishevelled on the bed, flushed skin and teary eyes, she was so lovely and tantalizing that it was enough to make men want to chew and swallow her up.\u2018I\u2019m going to swallow her whole one day.\u2019The blue eyes of the man looking down at Annette, were all the more hideous. The man\u2019s body, which pressed her down, was so big and muscular, that one would not even be able to see Annette\u2019s petite body from outside.As he let out a grumbling groan while ramming his thick penis deep inside her, Annette felt as if she was being attacked by a beast. Her petite body shuddered at the very thought.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s too hard. Slow down.. Aah\u2026.now stop..please?\u201dA drop of tear flowed down Annette\u2019s pallid cheeks. The man paused for a short moment but pretended as if he was not affected by Annette\u2019s pitiful pleas. He lowered his hand and skimmed his fingers along her clitoris. Annette trembled as his fingers teased her heated vagina. His fingers which had held many swords, were unusually firm and rough, making it more stimulating.He feigned ignorance of Annette\u2019s sensitive response and mischievously flicked the bloated clitoris. Annette moaned as an exhilarating pleasure gripped her body. The man withdrew his hand and brought it in front of her. The hand which was playing with her clitoris just before, was soaked in her love fluids.The man licked the transparent honey covering his hands and stretched the corners of his mouth in a smirk and said,\u201cYou want me to stop doing this? It\u2019s funny because your lower lips are tightly clenching me down there. But your upper lips are saying something else. They\u2019re so deceptive just like your family, Annette. \u201cAnnette looked at the man\u2019s resentful eyes and his beautiful lips. His cold visage and red plump lips gave him a sensational beauty, which could make even women jealous. However the words which came out of those lips were bitter and obscene.When he faced her teary eyes glazed with lust, he became oddly excited. His penis buried deep inside her, wriggled like a living creature, growing more in volume. A surprised Annette tightened her insides reflexively, making the man frown. He felt he couldn\u2019t hold back anymore and started to thrust again.\u201cShh, Annette. If you really want me to quit, please don\u2019t open that dirty hole. I\u2019m going crazy here because I want to squeeze it in right now. If you want to finish this quickly, spread your legs wider.\u201dThe lewd words coming from the man\u2019s mouth bothered Annette and made her feel very ashamed. The man, who had finished speaking, began to shake his waist earnestly.Every time he dug deep, she felt as if her insides were choking and burning. When his hard, stiff penis poked her heated inner walls without mercy, her eyes turned white in pleasure. The little hole, which had already known the joy of love affairs, trembled pitifully but still tightened around his genitals as if feeling overwhelmed by joy.\u201cOh uh uh uh aah!\u201dHot breaths and kisses rained on her slender neck and shoulders. Bodies covered in sweat were joined and bare limbs intertwined tightly in the dark. Large hands grasped Annette\u2019s face to the side, and a thick tongue intruded her mouth.Annette accepted the pleasure he provided. When the thick penis stabbed her insides, it felt so good that she couldn\u2019t think of anything else. The more intense the insertion became, the more her inner walls were rubbed, leaving her screaming in pleasure.Terrified of the seemingly endless nature of the affair, Annette crawled away unknowingly from him. She was scared of his body heat and rough movements that could easily crush her. However the beast who had already tasted his sweet prey had no intention of letting it go. He pressed his big hands on her back as if to completely block all her escape routes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He rammed deeper and faster. His hands were locked onto her waist as his thrusts became more violent and powerful.As his penis rubbed her good places, the last bit of reasoning that she had faintly flew away. The only thing left was a melting pleasure between her legs. Her vagina clamped around him as she convulsed in extreme pleasure.\u201cAhhh\u201dDue to the breath-taking climax, Annette was so overwhelmed that she could not even moan properly. She gasped and tightly grasped the man\u2019s body as if it was an anchor. Her narrow hole, which was already tight, tightened more as if it wanted to bite off the man\u2019s penis. Her body convulsed in pleasure, emitting an erotic smell.The beastly man groaned in sheer pleasure as her insides shook and tightened. Blue veins surfaced over his neck as he clenched his teeth and plunged his penis deeper inside her.\u201cUgghh\u201dThe man let out a hot moan. His manhood swelled up and a thick white fluid gushed out. It shot all over her lower part, dripping down her legs. Annette\u2019s exhausted body drooped on the bed. Eyes heavily lidded, she took a moment to pacify her chaotic breathing.The man looked at Annette with a slight smile. The small, tender woman gave him a terrible feeling of satiety. But he still wanted to taste her a little more.With his head down, he pushed his tongue into Annette\u2019s earhole and licked it clumsily. The light pink ears were so lovely that he wanted to eat them up.Annette, who had sensitive ears squealed in surprise. Her muffled sobs and breathless moans made the man\u2019s lower body become stiff again.\u201cAnnette, Annette\u2026 What a terribly shameless body this is.\u201dThe man murmured as if he was reproaching her, but the one, who was really excited, was him. Annette was struck by fear as she felt him become stiff again. If they did it one more time, then she would truly die.Tears welled up in Annette\u2019s large pink eyes. She turned her head and faced the man. She carefully wrapped her arms around his neck and looked up at him with the most pitiful look possible.The man paused, he always became weak when Annette pulled that face. He knew that he was falling for Annette\u2019s tricks but was helpless. Even though he wanted to have her to his heart\u2019s desire, every time her soft lips touched his face, a corner of his heart tickled strangely.\u201cRafael\u2026.\u201dHis name, which came out of Annette\u2019s mouth, was soft and pitiful. He clicked his tongue disapprovingly, feeling himself get weak. He could have continued to press on her soft body, but strangely he didn\u2019t want to do it. Every time when the woman whispered in a soft and pitiful voice, the ferocious aggression inside him calmed down.\u2018This was a really bad thing.\u2019The man raised himself and spoke out in a cold tone.\u201cSuch a crafty Bavarian woman.\u201d Although his words seemed cold, Annette knew the truth. It actually meant that he would let her go.Annette, who was finally released from the arms of the beast, took a breath of relief. Even after her return, her husband was still extremely energetic and a very mean person. Because of this, Annette in her previous life used to cry all night every day.The wounds of her heart made her debilitated like a dry blade of grass. And Annette was often ill. Even the last moments of her previous life were spent on her bed, sick. Annette\u2019s past marriage was obviously an unhappy one.But this time, it should be different.No, it will be different. Annette was determined to tame her wicked beast of a husband and get a life of comfort. She didn\u2019t know yet whether the result would be a happy marriage or a divorce, but this time, it would be in her hands.Rafael draped the gown over his muscular body which held many traces of the war, and reached out to the doorknob as if trying to leave her bedroom. Upon seeing this, Annette even said goodbye to him in a feeble voice.\u201cThank you, Rafael. Good night.\u201dOf course, there was no reply. He turned his back like a man who had never heard anything, and coldly left her bedroom. As the door closed, a cool breeze touched Annette\u2019s cheeks. She touched her cheeks as if consoling herself. It was okay though. To discipline the beast, she has to start with a praise. Annette smiled, she was exhausted.Her new operation was to tame Rafael into a good husband.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She touched the bouquet of white Calla flowers and light purple Lisianthus flowers and smiled softly.\u2018I never thought I\u2019d marry the same man twice.\u2019And of all the people, the man is none other than Rafael. It all somehow seemed like a poor joke.Annette, who had died from an illness, apparently returned back to five years ago. At first, she thought it was all just a dream, but it turned out to be a reality.Annette, dressed in a white wedding dress, slowly walked into the ceremonial hall. The scattered light pink petals, the light jasmine scent surrounding the ceremonial hall, and the curious murmurs of the people were exactly the same as five years ago.Annette\u2019s return was on the morning of her wedding day. Because of this, she didn\u2019t have an option to reject marrying Rafael again.She had to hold Rafael\u2019s hand, who stared at her coldly as she walked down the wedding aisle just as she did five years ago.\u2018This life will be different. I\u2019m not going to have a miserable marriage like before.\u2019A look of resolute determination came on Annette\u2019s doll-like face. She lived a very passive life before. Coming from the most prestigious family in Deltium, she received a harsh education in manners and etiquette. The phrase \u2018a flower in the greenhouse\u2019 was probably the best to describe her previous life. Thanks to this, she couldn\u2019t endure the harsh life. She often became ill and finally died miserably.She didn\u2019t want to die like that again. So, Annette decided to change everything one by one right away.Like her second marriage.Fortunately thanks to the memories of her previous life, this wedding was much easier. In fact, it seemed that it couldn\u2019t have worked out better than this.Annette, in the past, was very upset on the day of her wedding. She got married as if she was being kicked out from her family under false pretenses, and her husband, Rafael was frighteningly cold towards her. The evil gossips and murmurs of the guests flew into a frightened Annette\u2019s ears and left a great scar. Her previous immature self couldn\u2019t contain her anxiety until the end, and she cried a lot during the wedding.Of course, Rafael\u2019s face became grim when he experienced this. He misunderstood that Annette cried because she didn\u2019t want to marry him and ended up hating her more. Since Rafael was originally an illegitimate child, he had a strong insecurity towards his origin.Annette\u2019s tears ended up having an adverse negative effect. It made people\u2019s curiosity even bigger. The guests were thrilled to see how unhappy she looked at her wedding and how sadly she cried. A lot of bad rumours spread because of this incident and this made Rafael feel uncomfortable throughout their honeymoon. She sighed as she remembered the past.\u2018Now let\u2019s not make that mistake again.\u2019So Annette smiled as if she was happy this time. She blushed shyly, clasped Rafael\u2019s arms, and kept her new bride-like, fluttering smile. She raised her head proudly and looked only forward, ignoring the evil chatters of others. Then their voices gradually faded and died down.\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you say it was a political marriage? For something like that, the bride looks very happy. She looks like she has a crush on the groom.\u201d\u201c\u2026Somehow I thought that the Bavarian family was giving up their precious daughter. Maybe the young lady begged them to marry the Marquis of Carnesis first? He\u2019s actually very good-looking. Look at those robes. Oh my God!\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s because Bavaria is so great. But Marquis of Carnesis is also a good marriage prospect. There are rumours that he will soon become the Master of Swords. I even heard that he got a huge reward for his great work in the last war. You know what he got? Iron ore and diamond mines! If I were her, even I would fall in love with him!\u201d\u201cShh! The Duke of Bavaria looked this way. Let\u2019s be careful.\u201dThe guests who were gossiping and giggling among themselves, became quiet at once when Annette\u2019s father, Allamand Bavaria looked at them. Annette\u2019s father, the Duke of Bavaria was a very powerful man. The family of Bavaria had a reputation for being the noblest family after the Royal family in the capital. The fame and wealth that they\u2019ve built over hundreds of years was so big, that no one dared to compare with them. Those who were jealous of them, sometimes sarcastically called them \u2018Blue Blooded Bavarians\u2019 due to their cold blooded nature.Therefore, Annette\u2019s father regarded the wedding as a great disgrace. If it hadn\u2019t been for \u2018the incident,\u2019 he would have never let Annette get married to an illegitimate child like Rafael in the first place.However Annette was inevitably married to Rafael in her previous life, and throughout her married life, she struggled to mediate between her father and her husband.\u2018Of course, I couldn\u2019t satisfy both. I was so stupid.\u2019Annette laughed, thinking of her previous naive and immature self. But no matter what the inside story behind this marriage was, it was time for her to play a happy bride. Annette took a steady step, maintaining the shy smile on her face. When she walked proudly, only looking forward, the murmurs around her soon faded away. At last, she could see the podium where the pastor was waiting in the distance.Annette seeing this, suddenly slowed down. It was a slight act of hesitation which contrasted with the previous her who was confidently smiling and walking down the aisle.\u201cAh\u201dThe moment she saw the podium, Annette suddenly became aware of the reality. The podium brought back the memories of her previous miserable marriage.\u2018Will this marriage be terrible again this time? Am I going to be sick and die miserably again?\u2019Annette stopped walking. She felt as if she was rushing into a cliff, knowing it was right before her. Annette hesitated for a moment due to her past trauma.Suddenly, she felt a strong force tugging her hands and dragging her forward. It was none other than Rafael, who was escorting her.\u201cRafael?\u2026..Why all of a sudden?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Beyond a thin veil, she saw a handsome man with black hair. Rafael, who was much taller than Annette, was stubbornly looking ahead. His red plump lips, under his cold, sleek nose were mesmerizing. A low voice came out of them, which could only be heard by her.\u201cKeep smiling, and don\u2019t stop again. There is nowhere to escape.\u201dAnnette laughed bitterly at the oppressive tone of the man. Rafael was right. Thanks to his warning, Annette was able to walk comfortably down the wedding aisle without much effort.Maybe it\u2019s because he thought she was dizzy, he grabbed her arms more tightly. His grip was rather reassuring. Annette looked ahead with a more sincere heart. Then she saw her father in the distance. The Duke of Bavaria was as perfect as ever.Annette\u2019s mother was already dead, and her brother was unable to attend her wedding as he was in an another country. That\u2019s why her father was the only one from her family that was present here. Allamand Bavaria, with a sleek face and striking platinum blond hair, looked incredibly young. It was hard to believe that this man had fathered two grown up children.The expression of the Duke of Bavaria was so calm, that no one was able to know what was going on in his mind. Because of this, the guests gossiped as they liked.\u201c\u2026Well, look at the Duke\u2019s face. I think he\u2019s sad since his daughter is getting married. I guess she\u2019s lucky. She\u2019s such a pretty daughter, who wouldn\u2019t feel sad to part from her.\u201d\u201cLook at Annette on the other hand. She is smiling like a blooming flower. She looks so cute. Maybe the young bride has a crush on the groom. Looking at them like this, they look much better together than I thought.\u201dThe gossips of the ignorant guests worked towards her favour this time. Although Annette became an immature young lady who had fallen for Rafael, this was indeed not bad. Because of this, Rafael\u2019s expression as he walked next to her became much softer. Just because she didn\u2019t upset him in anyway, the wedding was a success.As she listened to the pastor\u2019s speech, she sneaked a glance over at the place where the guests were sitting. Fortunately, the prince and his new fianc\u00e9e were not there. Just like her previous life, he didn\u2019t attend Annette\u2019s wedding this time too. It was rather a good thing.Annette was relieved to know that the prince and his fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t attend her wedding. They sure would have made the whole ceremony awkward. The guests didn\u2019t know anything about this as the Duke had made sure to silence this matter.If it continues like this, the wedding would end well. If only the last procedure of the ceremony could also go well.\u201cNow, the groom may kiss the bride and then take your vows.\u201dThe words coming from the pastor\u2019s mouth sounded like a death sentence. At least it did for Annette.Annette, who was very nervous, grabbed the bouquet tightly without realizing it. She was unsure whether Rafael would kiss her this time.Rafael, in her previous life\u2026.was very angry. And it was somewhat her fault.When the pastor said the words, Annette cried during the wedding ceremony. It was a marriage that neither of them wanted, but Annette couldn\u2019t control her facial expression. Because of this, Rafael became very angry and responded coldly to the pastor\u2019s request to kiss her.\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Just finish the vows.\u201dSo their first wedding ended up becoming a joke. Annette became the first bride to be never kissed by the groom and this made her father, Allamand very angry. Of course it wasn\u2019t because he loved Annette.Allamand considered this as an insult as the status of Bavaria was ignored in public and that too by an illegitimate child like Rafael. Naturally, an angry Allamand had a big fight with Rafael at the reception. Annette, who became the cause of the fight, was so ashamed that she just wanted to die.\u2018Please\u2026.I hope my marriage doesn\u2019t end up like that, this time.\u2019Annette bit her lips tightly, and nervously waited for Rafael\u2019s next move. Soon, the transparent veil on her head was lifted and Rafael\u2019s face came in front of her eyes.With a white, handsome face and dark black hair hanging down, he was a very attractive man. However, his dark blue eyes looking at her were very cold. Even though he had hardened his face not to reveal his emotions, Annette could still clearly see a look of reluctance on his face. He was unwilling to kiss her. The moment she saw the cold expression, Annette had a bad hunch.\u2018Oh, Rafael won\u2019t kiss me this time.\u2019Annette lowered her eyes to hide her disappointment. She was worried about how to stop her father, who would blame Rafael and fight with him at the reception.At that moment, a crazy idea flashed through Annette\u2019s mind.\u2018Wait a minute, is it necessary to wait for the groom to kiss first? If I do it first, will it not serve the purpose?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she thought of kissing him, her lips suddenly became dry. But rather than living a passive life like her previous one, she wanted to try anything to make this life better. Even if it was a little crazy effort.Anyway, because of Annette\u2019s acting, the guests already thought she was in love with Rafael. So no one would blame her if the bride kissed the groom first. No, they might just laugh it off saying the marriage between the couple looked good.\u2018Yes, let\u2019s just do it.\u2019Rafael wouldn\u2019t be offended by just putting on and taking off her lips for a while. Motivated by this thought, Annette looked up at Rafael with a determined but tense look on her face. Looking at the face of Annette, which seemed as if she was preparing for something, Rafael frowned as if puzzled. He couldn\u2019t understand why she was looking at him with such a serious expression.At that moment, Annette grabbed Rafael\u2019s collar and pulled him down as hard as she could. In an instant the two lips met, and Annette\u2019s golden eyelashes trembled with tension. Rafael\u2019s blue eyes, which never revealed his emotions, widened with surprise.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dAnnette puckered her lips together and closed her eyes tightly because she didn\u2019t have the courage to look him in the eye. She could feel the heat exuding from his lips.Rafael never expected Annette would come at him like this. But at this moment, she was definitely kissing him!\u2018You did it!\u2019Annette\u2019s whole body shuddered with tension. She quickly took off her lips from him. Her heart was beating excessively fast and her vision became hazy. Annette gasped and looked up at Rafael\u2019s face.Rafael was still looking down at her with an emotionless face but she could see the shock in his eyes. The moment she saw his eyes, Annette became grim and quickly let go off her hands, tightly clutching his collar. She closed her eyes and prepared herself for his impending wrath.\u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be angry.\u2019Rafael was a proud man with a fiery temper. He was a person who would get angry easily whenever he was offended.Annette shrugged her shoulders unknowingly and closed her eyes tightly. At that moment, a large hand grasped her chin and raised her head up. Before she knew it, a beautiful face came before her. Rafael was looking at her intensely as he approached her. He quietly whispered,\u201cYou can\u2019t just start off on your own and end it at your will.\u201dWhat the hell does this mean? Annette blinked, not understanding what Rafael\u2019s words meant. Then Rafael\u2019s handsome mouth curved in a mocking smile, showing a bitter cynicism that she was well acquainted with. Unlike his cold handsome face, his lips were terribly red and sensual.Rafael raised her head in a comfortable angle and pressed his plump lips on hers. Annette trembled with surprise at the unexpected kiss. The formal kiss for the ceremony had already been completed, so she had no idea why he was doing this.\u201c!\u201dRafael\u2019s kiss felt like a retaliation. Annette blushed as he kept on kissing her without having any regards to the eyes of others. His hot tongue probed her lips open and surged inside her mouth. His velvety tongue roughly wandered inside her, tasting her thoroughly.As the tip of his tongue slowly skimmed through her sensitive palate, she felt chills run up and down her spine. Annette was surprised and reflexively pulled her body back. Rafael\u2019s other hand curled around her waist tightly and pulled it closer.As he said, there was nowhere to escape now.Annette\u2019s body unknowingly bended backwards as Rafael continued to kiss her fiercely.His lips never left hers. He twisted his head not wanting to leave any gap and continued kissing her persistently. He sucked and teased her tongue and lips simultaneously, leaving her no room to breathe. Her head became dizzy by the deep kiss. She felt like she was going to be eaten alive by him right now.\u201cRa, Rafael\u2026..\u201dAnnette, frightened by the suffocating kiss, gasped and reflexively put her hands on his shoulder to push him away. But thankfully, Annette soon realised her action and controlled herself. She couldn\u2019t reject Rafael in front of others. She was sure he\u2019ll be greatly hurt as his pride was very big.Fortunately, in the eyes of the guests who knew nothing, they seemed to be very much in love as they hugged and kissed each other passionately. The guests who were looking at this open display of passionate love, were startled and chattered among themselves,\u201cOh my God! Isn\u2019t this a political marriage? It doesn\u2019t seem like it. I\u2019ve never seen such a passionate wedding in my life!\u201d\u201cOh my God, what a surprise! I wonder what\u2019s really between the two of them!\u201dFortunately, the reactions of the guests were favorable. Even though they blushed at the hot kiss between the bride and groom, they still applauded and praised them.At first, they only came to find some gossip behind this unexpected marriage, but what they finally saw was something even more incredible. Now, only their passionate kiss will be remembered by these guests after they return.Annette was so dizzy from the kiss that she couldn\u2019t hear anything. However Rafael, the most promising Lord General in the Kingdom of the Deltium, was a little different. Rafael smiled thinly at the whispers that were caught by his sharp hearing.He would have surely laughed if someone had told him this was how this despicable marriage would take place. He was quite surprised by the turn of events today.\u2018But it\u2019s not as despicable as I thought.\u2019Just like Annette, Rafael too was reluctant to marry. His only weakness was his birth, and he had to marry Annette Bavaria to compensate for it. Even if she was a wicked woman, as his father said Rafael had no choice. So he already expected this wedding to be terrible.He was sick and tired of people\u2019s gossips and he also thought of Annette\u2019s pretending to be a victim abominable. She was after all a woman who should have become the Crown Princess. But she ended up getting married to an illegitimate child like him. So he thought she must be feeling like the world is over.It would have been terrible if Annette had cried in front of others here. Rafael who was determined to be patient, sure would have exploded in anger. However Annette had a joyful smile all the time as if she was very happy with this marriage. She was so good at managing her facial expressions that even he almost fell for it. It really seemed as if she truly liked him.\u2018What is this woman thinking?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He snickered as he looked at this. That\u2019s right! How could Annette Bavaria fall in love with him, she was just putting up an act for everyone.Rafael was a little impressed with her boldness. He was very satisfied with how wisely she behaved in front of others. But at the same time, he was also disgusted by her. After all, she was a woman who had tried every trick to become the Crown Princess.Rafael did not like her.When he saw Annette hesitating on seeing the pastor, he forcibly pulled her arms. It was truly annoying! It seemed that she had still not yet given up her regrets on not becoming a queen. It was good that Annette later cooperated with him and he didn\u2019t have to force her before the pastor. After that, he didn\u2019t pay much attention to her.\u201cNow, the groom may kiss the bride and then take your vows.\u201dWhen the pastor said these words, only then did Rafael come to his senses. He had forgotten about the last procedure of the ceremony.Rafael looked casually down at Annette\u2019s face, which was revealed over the veil. She was a pretty woman with a doll-like face and striking blonde hair. But he didn\u2019t really have a particular desire to kiss her.No, he refused to kiss the snake-like Bavarian woman.Surprisingly at that very moment, Annette grabbed his collar and kissed him. The texture of the rustling cotton cloth tickled his face, and a wonderful flowery scent permeated his senses. As soon as he felt her trembling lips pressed against his, Rafael became stiff.\u2018Now\u2026.What\u2026What are you doing now?\u2019The kiss was short and in a blink of an eye, Annette removed her lips and looked up at him with trembling eyes. She seemed as if she was regretting what she did. Annette, who had been looking at Rafael\u2019s face for a while, soon lowered her eyes as if it was all over.The moment he saw that face, Rafael felt a strange tingling feeling in his chest. He couldn\u2019t let himself be swayed by the sly Bavarian woman.So Rafael retaliated by kissing her fiercely. He licked her soft lips and swallowed them up, without leaving even a breath of her sweet scent.And soon he regretted his decision.Kissing Annette felt damn good. The texture of the shy little tongue attached to the tip of his tongue, was tantalizingly soft. As he sucked on her tongue, a trembling breath of surprise came out of Annette\u2019s mouth.He was really amused at seeing Annette pretending to be innocent. But at that moment, she had Rafael quite moved. He had to do his best to get away from those lips, which tasted like honey.\u201cHa.\u201dA thread of silver liquid glistened and disappeared between the two parted lips. Annette\u2019s bewildered face looked like as if she was completely lost. She, who was always calm and quiet, was so stiff that she resembled a scared rabbit.The moment he saw her face, Rafael unexpectedly burst out laughing. He thought she was a woman who was evil to the core. But looking at her like this, she seemed to have a cute side to her. The unexpected kiss made his lower body feel quite agitated, which hardly ever reacted like this. He somehow seemed to be looking forward to the first night with her.His laughter tickled Annette\u2019s forehead at a close distance. Only then did her rosy pink eyes return back to focus.\u201cAh.\u201dAnnette\u2019s face when she came back to her senses became red.\u2018What did you do in front of so many guests!\u2019Anyway, it was fortunate that Rafael did not refuse to kiss her. Annette, who was unaware of Rafael\u2019s expectations for the upcoming night, was relieved for now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She felt her face burning by just thinking about the deep kiss. But the more she tried, the hotter her face became. When she heard Rafael\u2019s laughter at seeing her reddened face, she was so embarrassed that she couldn\u2019t bear it any more. Annette eventually gave up and hid her face in her bouquet.Rafael, who was watching Annette like this, thought that her desperate bird-like appearance was very cute. Her manner was somehow reminiscent of a rabbit burrowing into a burrow. He thought she was a quiet girl who was like a doll, but looking at her like this, she seemed a little different.When Rafael saw her ears turning red, which were exposed through her gracefully tied blonde hair, he finally laughed out loud. \u201cHa ha!\u201dRafael laughed out loudly and hugged her shoulder, pretending to be friendly. Since Annette had worked this hard, he also needed to keep up with the rhythm, so as not to disappoint all the bloodthirsty eyes here.Annette felt her heart flutter a little at his smile. She became even more embarrassed and could not show her face. She walked out of the room as he led her.The atmosphere of the wedding ceremony heated up thanks to the steamy kissing scene. Unlike in her previous life, the guests praised and blessed the couple saying, \u201cAnnette and Rafael are a perfect match.\u201d It was amazing to see how the evaluation could change even though it was the same wedding.Thanks to this, the atmosphere of the reception was amicable all the time.So Annette\u2019s second wedding ended well. Although her father, Allamand seemed a little displeased, he did not criticize or blame Rafael. Everything worked out really well.However one more important event remained. It was none other than the \u2018first night\u2019 of the bride and the groom.\ud83d\udd36\ud83d\udd36\ud83d\udd36\u201cWhen will Rafael come?\u201dAnnette rubbed her sleepy eyes. She was very tired. She had to wake up early in the morning and then worry about successfully completing her wedding. All this took quite a toll on her. So she couldn\u2019t help but fall asleep. She eventually leaned against the bedpost and began to doze off.\u2018How long has it been?\u2019Suddenly, she heard the door open. Rafael strode into the room, wearing a robe over his large body. His black hair and firm chest, which was still wet, gleamed under the light. Rafael\u2019s deep blue eyes looked straight at her just like a predator who had found his prey.\u201cYou haven\u2019t slept yet.\u201dRafael was so tall and well built, that his mere appearance made the bedroom suddenly feel like it was cramped. His half naked body gave off an overbearing feeling of intimidation just like a giant black panther. Annette quickly got out of bed, feeling an unknown sense of crisis. Her tongue darted out to wet her lips nervously.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been waiting for you.\u201dRafael\u2019s eyes deepened at her strangely naive answer. Even though it was a trivial answer, it felt strangely stimulating. The atmosphere in the quiet room suddenly became tense with anticipation. Fortunately, it was Rafael who broke this awkward silence first.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s have a drink.\u201dBlinking at the unexpected suggestion, Annette went to him instantly. Rafael\u2019s reaction was different today, perhaps because the wedding ended well. In her previous life, he didn\u2019t even recommend drinking. Rafael, who appeared drunk all alone, rushed to her in a craze and \u2026\u2026No, there was no need to recall the painful memories.Annette calmly sat down in front of him. Rafael tilted the bottle and filled her glass with wine. The clear golden liquid smelled fragrant and strong. It was an expensive wine that he enjoyed. Rafael, who half filled Annette\u2019s glass, suddenly looked up at her questioningly,\u201cYou know how to drink, right?\u201dUnlike Rafael, Annette didn\u2019t enjoy drinking that much. Since Rafael was friendly with her for the first time, she didn\u2019t want to ruin this atmosphere. Annette, as he suggested, took the glass of wine and chugged it\u2019s contents down. She felt a burning sensation as if her oesophagus had caught fire.Rafael, who had already emptied his glass, looked at Annette with resolute eyes. His deep blue eyes slowly skimmed over Annette\u2019s small face, gentle eyes, and flushed cheeks. His gaze stopped at her lips that were as alluring as a blooming bud.At that moment, Rafael frowned and his forehead furrowed in displease. He was annoyed with the fact that he felt some sort of sexual attraction towards Annette. He couldn\u2019t believe he lusted a woman from the Bavarian family, who despised his illegitimate status.Rafael\u2019s blue eyes turned cold.Annette, who had not yet noticed this change in Rafael, put down her glass and touched her burning cheeks. When she looked up at him, she was stunned.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201dAnnette, who had already been married to Rafael, quickly realized something was wrong with him. She didn\u2019t know why, but Rafael\u2019s face was pretty twisted at the moment. Not surprisingly, as soon as their eyes met, Rafael smiled sardonically.\u201cCome on, now that you\u2019ve had a drink, be honest with me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What the\u2026\u201dAnnette suddenly had a bad premonition. She tried to ask him calmly but then Rafael came close to her and whispered in a wicked tone.\u201cDo you still believe you can be the Crown Princess?\u201dIn an instant the atmosphere cooled down. This was a misunderstanding that tormented Annette in her previous life.The accusation that she made a vicious move to become the Crown Princess.Even in her previous life, Rafael believed in this false accusation and this led to their honeymoon end up with fights and tears.\u2018In fact, I don\u2019t even remember those memories of \u2018him\u2019 right now.\u2019Annette, who returned, did not care about the marriage that was cancelled five years ago. The face of the Crown Prince Ludwig, who she once believed she would marry, now was only a hazy memory. Now that she thought about it, it was actually a good thing, that she didn\u2019t become the Crown Princess.However, one thing that Annette found unfair was that she could not clear herself of her false charges until she died. Even if she was not interested in being the Crown Princess, Annette wanted to clear up all the false charges against her. After all, her previous life became miserable because she didn\u2019t take any initiative herself.Rafael\u2019s blue eyes flashed coldly as he looked at her. When Annette saw it, she sighed inwardly. She had tried to defend herself hundreds of times in her previous life, even though she knew it was useless.\u201cThat\u2019s a misunderstanding, Rafael. I\u2019ve never done anything like that. Someone framed me.\u201d\u201cWho is it? That\u2019s funny! The testimony was very clear. For someone who wanted to be a Crown Princess, you must have been terribly disappointed to marry someone like me.\u201dAnnette\u2019s protests went unheard. His eyes were so malicious, as he looked down at her with total contempt. Rafael, without any doubt, believed the rumours he heard, just like in her previous life.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, then I don\u2019t have anything to say to you anymore. It\u2019s late today, so let\u2019s rest and talk again tomorrow.\u201dAnnette was tired and didn\u2019t want to repeat the same argument. She got up to leave, as she usually did whenever Rafael was being mean. It was useless to say anything to him when he was like this. Rather the longer the conversation was, the more uglier the fight became. So it was wise to avoid it before a fight broke out.However, Rafael, who was a newlywed, did not let her go so easily. Before she knew it, a large hand wrapped around her wrist and pulled her, just like he did at the wedding.\u201cWhere are you going on our first night? Don\u2019t make me upset, Annette.\u201dThe small and slender Annette was no match for the well-built Rafael. As she fell back under his strong grip, her blonde hair that the maids had brushed beautifully for a long time, became dishevelled. Rafael reached out his hand and tenderly brushed her dishevelled hair. Annette shuddered at his sudden affectionate touch.The feeling of a warm, large hand brushing her hair along the curve of her earlobe was too vivid. Annette unconsciously, turned her head and avoided his touch. But Rafael roughly grasped her face and turned it back towards him.\u201cShh, you think I\u2019m a bad guy, that\u2019s why you keep avoiding me like this, right? Why? Is it because I\u2019m not the Crown Prince? Oh yeah, a noble Bavarian like you would obviously get sick just by looking at a bastard like me! Hmm?\u201dRafael\u2019s voice was chillingly sweet. But the words he spoke became more and more hurtful. He was determined to have a quarrel with her. He would occasionally come to her with this unrestrained rage, as he did today.If it had been the same as in the past, Annette would have fought him back fiercely. And they would have ended up arguing back and forth until they couldn\u2019t hurt each other any more.But Annette, who had returned, had no more anger in her. These wasteful quarrels had already exhausted her in previous life. Even though Annette was hurt by Rafael\u2019s words, she found it equally painful to hurt him back. So now she wanted to be a little wise.It was time to find a smarter way to deal with him.\u201cLet go of me, Rafael. Hmm?\u201dInstead of being angry, Annette gently grabbed Rafael\u2019s hand clutching her cheek and in a calm voice, she demanded him to let go of her. Her face, which was strongly held by Rafael, was uncomfortable. Being a former War General, his grip was unusually rough and strong.Of course, Rafael did not let her go so easily. Rafael hated his half brother, Crown Prince Ludwig. That\u2019s why he loathed Annette even more, who tried despicable means to marry him. His eyes filled with cold hatred felt like a needle piercing into her skin.But Annette was not afraid of him. Rafael had never raised his hand against Annette in the last five years anyway. Annette, unlike before, decided to be more clever this time. Fortunately, she had a little idea of how to deal with Rafael.\u201cLet me go, Rafael. It really hurts.\u201dAnnette, who whispered faintly, quivered her lips slightly. She really looked like she was in extreme pain. The sight of her was so pitiful that it unconsciously invoked a sense of distress in him. At that moment, Rafael was startled and quickly removed his hand from her face.\u201cAre you really hurt?\u201dRafael was a little dubious at Annette\u2019s fox-like actions. His gaze swept over her slender jaw and neckPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His wife was so small. Her hands and feet were as small as a doll\u2019s, and so was her delicate white face. This made it a little difficult for him to treat her harshly. No matter how hard he controlled his strength, his grip which had trained with the sword, was strong enough to hurt her. So in the end, he had no choice but to let her go, even though he was suspicious.In the meantime, Annette slipped out of Rafael\u2019s grasp. As she stood up from her seat, she didn\u2019t want to miss this opportunity. She softly said goodbye to Rafael and tried her best not to make it seem, as if she was running away from him.\u201cI\u2019ll go back to my room first today. Rafael, I think you are a little drunk now. If you have any questions for me, let\u2019s talk when you are sober tomorrow. I\u2019ll be going now, then.\u201dAfter finishing her words in a smooth flow, Annette felt quite proud of herself. She was able to come out of an argument very rationally, all by herself.\u2018Why couldn\u2019t I do it in my previous life?\u2019Because of this, she always fought with Rafael.\u2018We fought really badly back then.\u2019Annette turned around and felt a little sad. If she had handled it as well as she did now, they would have hurt each other less. However it was too rash to let her guard down with Rafael now behind her. He was not a naive man to let her go so easily.The moment Annette grabbed the doorknob, all of a sudden, all of her nerves stood up and warned her of an imminent danger. It was like a reflex of a herbivorous animal that sensed a predator coming from behind.Annette turned her head in surprise. No, she tried to turn it. But her body was stuck close to the door, and behind her, Rafael crushed her and held her immobilized. The hot breath that fell on her ears, made her shudder.\u201cI told you, Annette. Today is the first night of our honeymoon and you can never run away from me.\u201dHis faint deep-toned voice sounded just like a low roar of a beast. After speaking, Rafael stuck out his tongue and licked her round earlobe. At that moment, Annette sensed a crisis and tried to flee.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dBut the arms that locked her from behind, had no intention of letting her go. Annette was trapped between the door and Rafael\u2019s body. Before she knew it, his hand grabbed the back of her thin chemise. Due to his terrifyingly strong grip, the cloth got torn in half and loosely flowed down to the centre of her back.\u201cAh\u2026\u2026!\u201dAnnette quickly grabbed the front of her chemise, which was also about to flow down. She somehow managed to prevent exposing her front, but unfortunately could not do anything about the bared part of her back.Rafael was dazzled by the white skin that was revealed on her back. He bowed his head like a beast trying to bite off a rabbit\u2019s neck, and bit and sucked the back of her neck pretty hard.Annette gasped and almost stopped breathing. A rough breath stroked her exposed elegant nape and her body trembled unconsciously. She felt goosebumps all over her skin.Rafael\u2019s hand, which stretched out from behind, pressed her shoulders down so that she couldn\u2019t move. He pushed her petite body closer to the door and began to place fervent kisses along her back. The sensation of fingertips over her prominent wing bones was too vivid.\u201cShh, you\u2019re gonna stay still, aren\u2019t you? Now you\u2019re my wife Annette.\u201dRafael bit her exposed earlobes gently, trying his best not to cause her any harm. The wet sounds and the feeling of his tongue licking the inside of her ear, was too much for Annette. She shrugged her body and tightly grabbed onto her chemise. She couldn\u2019t understand why he was doing this to her. He always looked at her with such cold hatred in his eyes, but on the other hand, he would touch and kiss her so passionately as if he desired her.\u2018What if Rafael really wants to spend the first night?\u2019Annette, who was stuck close to the cold door, was terrified. The first night of her previous life was terribly painful. Annette was hoping that Rafael will soon end the act and consider it a brief whim. But the pouring kisses around her neck were getting more and more hot.\u201cAnnette\u2026Annette, my noble wife. Please tell me directly with that mouth.

Please tell me directly with that mouth. Have you already given your body to the Crown Prince Ludwig? Huh?\u201dRafael pressed down his lips and let out a groan of excitement while interrogating her. He still seemed to firmly believe in those unjust accusations. She was falsely accused of throwing herself at Ludwig because she wanted to be the Crown Princess and she even harmed her rivals for it.Annette was ashamed because of the absurd misunderstanding. She clenched her teeth in exasperation. It would have been better if she had returned just before the \u2018event\u2019 took place. If she had, she could have avoided this malicious trap and maybe her future would have been different.But God unfortunately sent her back, right after the incident. There was nothing she could do at this point. Annette, who was bitten by her beastly husband, simply shuddered and appealed for her innocence.\u201cI\u2019ve never done that, Rafael. I didn\u2019t do anything with Ludwig and\u2026 This is my first time.\u201dAs she spoke, she felt her ears become hot. She wanted to ignore this ridiculous interrogation. But if Rafael wanted to go through the \u2018first night\u2019, she couldn\u2019t keep silent anymore. She paid the price of the stupid silence in her previous life. The memories of her first time were nothing but painful and she didn\u2019t want to go through it again.However Rafael ignored her confession and just laughed it off. His deep blue eyes flashed with wickedness as he ridiculed her.\u201cAs expected, Bavarians have a reputation for being expert liars. Did your family educate you well how to deceive people? You are pretty good!\u201dRafael, in anger, sunk his teeth into her soft delicate skin and bit her hard enough to leave a mark. Surprised by his sudden action, Annette trembled and turned her head to look at him.\u201cBelieve me, Rafael. I really\u2026..\u201d\u201cWell, who told you to look back!\u201dRafael brutally held her head and turned it back towards the door. It was a heartless attitude that made it clear to her that he didn\u2019t want to face her. Facing the cold wall, Annette bit her lips tightly in despair. She wanted to change this life, but how would she, if Rafael hated her so much?\u2018Why does Rafael hate me so much?\u2019Annette took a deep breath and tried to regain her composure. Panic and despair did nothing to change one\u2019s life. She racked her brain to somehow get out of this crisis. Soon Annette came up with a good solution. She spoke in a soft voice, so as not to provoke the beast behind her back.\u201cI\u2019m not lying. I can prove it. I\u2019ve never thrown myself at Ludwig, Rafael.\u201dAt that moment, Rafael froze. Annette felt his grip on her loosen. There was hope that maybe he would believe her words. So she tried to persuade him even more earnestly.\u201cReally, I swear Rafael. Shall we do this? Tomorrow morning, call a practitioner you can trust. Let him verify. \u2026.I\u2019ll cooperate. Would you believe me if I do that?\u201dAnnette suggested this in a quiet tone, hiding her resentment. Even now, when she had reincarnated, she had to suffer because of these false accusations. It was not fair that she had to go this length to prove her innocence. Fortunately, Deltium\u2019s current medical practices were excellent enough to prove her innocence. This was the best way!It would have been nice if she had called a practitioner in her previous life but Annette didn\u2019t dare to do so because of shame. Thanks to Rafael\u2019s misunderstanding, she had a terrible first night. Her bleeding was so severe that Rafael stopped in the middle of the act and ran directly out to call for a doctor.\u2018I don\u2019t want to repeat that terrible first night again.\u2019Annette bit her lips in sheer determination. Fortunately Rafael seemed to have felt something in her confident tone. He slowly took his lips off from Annette\u2019s smooth back. Even if she couldn\u2019t look back, Annette could feel Rafael\u2019s blue eyes staring at her.Annette plucked up her courage and slowly looked back. She was very determined this time. Even if he grabbed her face again and turned it back, she would try again. Even if it takes hundreds or thousand times. Annette had the right to speak, and he couldn\u2019t stop her.\u201cRafael?\u201dRafael\u2019s face was cold when she faced him. His face, which was revealed through his pitch black hair, was as perfect as a statue. Only the red lips under his sharp nose, proved his humanity. She wondered if the sensual lips held a cold smile, and suddenly a loud sound rang in her ear.Bang!\u201cArgggh!\u201dAnnette instinctively crouched and screamed. Something fell from the side and when she looked down, it was the remains of the broken door. An angry Rafael had smashed the door with his fist.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So crafty and cunning! It really pisses me off how you lie so skilfully with that naive-looking face.\u201dHis cruel words struck Annette\u2019s heart. She thought she had handled it well this time, but it was her mistake to think so. After all, Rafael was a stubborn and mean man. He wouldn\u2019t believe her so easily. Rafael smiled coldly when he saw Annette\u2019s face becoming white with shock.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s say you won today. Damn this first night! Just go anywhere. I don\u2019t want to see that face anymore.\u201dRafael took his hand from the broken door and turned heartlessly. Annette looked at his cold back and inwardly sighed. Even now, his temper was the same. Maybe she had gotten used to it, that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t even cry.\u2018Someday,\u2026. I\u2019ll get rid of this blame.\u2019And she would surely get an apology from Rafael for this misunderstanding.Although she was now walking barefoot through the dark hallway, it was still fine. She wouldn\u2019t do anything like in her previous life. She won\u2019t die as a passive woman who couldn\u2019t do anything for herself. Annette gathered all her courage and raised her bowed head up in determination.\ud83d\udd36\ud83d\udd36\ud83d\udd36The first decision of her new life happened very quickly. A practitioner was called to the house of Marquis of Carnesis. He was a young man in his early 30s, with glossy brown hair and dark eyebrows. He began to doubt his ears, when he heard Annette\u2019s odd request. After a moment of silence, he asked her carefully,\u201cWhat? What are you\u2026 What kind of treatment did you want?\u201dHis eyes seemed to want Annette to withdraw her words right away. It was a very embarrassing request. But Annette, who had already made up her mind, calmly repeated what she had just said.\u201cThat\u2026.I heard there are practitioners who can prove one\u2019s innocence. They are said to be from the Gynaecological side. Can you introduce someone like that from your circle to me? I\u2019d rather prefer the person to be a female practitioner.\u201dAnnette seemed calm on the surface, but she was actually shaking inside with shame. She clenched the arms of her chair so hard that her knuckles turned white. She wanted to withdraw what she said right now and send the practitioner back, but she knew this was the only way.Rafael, who hated Annette, would not believe in her innocence even if she appealed day and night. She had no choice but to show him corroborative evidence through the testimony of the practitioner. If she herself didn\u2019t take the initiative to clear her charges, no one would. The door will open only for those bold enough to knock. That was the lesson, Annette learned from her previous life.Annette bit her lips tightly as she recalled the last five years she had suffered. Rather than repeating the same misfortune again, it was much better to endure the momentary shame.\u201cWell, ma\u2019am. If you insist\u2026.\u201dWhen the practitioner saw Annette unwilling to withdraw her request, he broke out in a cold sweat. He seemed to be trying to tell her something. Just when Annette was about to listen, the door of the drawing room suddenly opened unceremoniously.Bang!!\u201cHey!\u201dSurprised by the unexpected loud noise, the practitioner screamed. Unlike his former professional face, he now seemed surprisingly timid. In fact, Annette was also surprised. She gazed at the unexpected intruder and her eyes widened.\u201cRafael? What are you doing here?\u201dAs it hadn\u2019t been long since he woke up, Rafael strode in, wearing a white shirt and pants. His well-trained muscles stood out from under his shirt. With his tall and muscular build, he looked threatening enough.His blue eyes flashed angrily as he turned towards the practitioner standing in front of Annette. He asked him in a gruff voice as if he was growling.\u201cHas the test been done already?\u201d\u201cYes, yes? What, what kind of test?..\u201dThe practitioner was so terrified that he didn\u2019t know what to say, and started to stutter. Rafael\u2019s face contorted with rage. He clenched his teeth and lashed out at him.\u201cYou damn fucker! Did you already do it or not?!\u201d\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t, Your Highness. I swear to God!! I\u2019m\u2026I didn\u2019t touch your wife at all!\u2026\u2026\u201dOnly then did the practitioner realise what Rafael was asking. He shook his hand desperately. He was shaking so much that he almost bit his tongue while talking. Annette was worried that he might get involved in a fight.Rafael, who saw the truth on the face of the frightened practitioner, strode towards him. He grabbed his collar and dragged him out of the drawing room and then slammed the door shut behind him. The air in the whole room seemed to vibrate along with the slammed door.Rafael really had a bad temper. The doors of the mansion which were slammed so hard, luckily didn\u2019t collapse. Well when she thought about it, yesterday he broke the bedroom\u2019s door. Annette, who was used to living with her boorish husband sighed as she saw him approaching her.\u201cWhat happened, Rafael? Is something wrong?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Annette, now, was unable to stand up or run away. Rafael seemed to feel better when he had blocked all her escape routes, before questioning her.The handsome face before her was frightening, as he stared at her coldly. Still angry, Rafael asked her out of the blue.\u201cWhat else are you trying to do by calling the practitioner? Are you planning to forge a medical certificate for this? That\u2019s a cunning move, Bavarian. It\u2019s not so easy to do that.\u201dIf it was the previous Annette, she would have felt very humiliated by this. And she would have argued back with him to return the same misery. But the present Annette wasn\u2019t like that. She opened her mouth and calmly said,\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Rafael. As I said yesterday, if you don\u2019t really believe me, then I can prove my innocence through the power of medicine. If you think I\u2019ll forge a medical certificate for this, then you can call a practitioner that you trust.\u201d\u201cYou really mean it when you say you want to be tested? Hah, would a person like you who\u2019s lived her life like a flower in a greenhouse, would go through such a shameful examination? Would you roll up your skirt and spread your legs for another man? Not even the dogs out there will believe this shit.\u201dAnnette, who heard Rafael\u2019s sarcasm, was a little frustrated. What the hell was she supposed to do? He didn\u2019t believe what she said and now that she said she would see a practitioner, he still doubted her. Annette knew he was a man with serious trust issues. But his behaviour was getting really sick.Apparently Rafael thought that she was going to see a male doctor. She was his wife and he couldn\u2019t tolerate the very thought of her spreading her legs in front of another man. That\u2019s why he scurried to the room to stop her. Annette, who had a husband with anger issues, struggled and agonized. She didn\u2019t know whether to be impressed by this or not.Rafael was a brute beast, but he never hurted her. At least physically. Maybe that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t hate him or wasn\u2019t afraid of him as before. He wasn\u2019t that bad.Since they were going to live in this relationship again, she didn\u2019t want to repeat the previous life. So she thought it was okay to tame him a little. A determined Annette called out his name softly.\u201cRafael\u201dShe looked into his eyes and slowly wrapped her arms around his neck. Rafael did not pull himself out of her embrace, but kept on looking at her skeptically, wondering what she was trying to pull. Annette blinked her eyes as she looked up at him and smiled softly. Then she lowered her eyes and whispered shyly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to see a practitioner\u2026 then how about you check it out yourself?\u201dThe burning anger in Rafael\u2019s eyes, dissipated on hearing her words and was now replaced with surprise. He looked as if he couldn\u2019t believe what he heard just now. He tried to open his mouth to say something to Annette, but nothing came out of his mouth. He was that much shocked by Annette\u2019s bold words.In fact Annette herself was a little shocked by her own boldness. She was originally a conservative woman with great integrity. However when she saw Rafael\u2019s embarrassed face, it didn\u2019t seem so bad. She slowly lifted her eyes and whispered to him.\u201cWe\u2019re a couple, aren\u2019t we? So you can check it out. I\u2019ll roll up my skirt and spread my legs for you to see. You can see it directly with your eyes\u2026..\u201dUnfortunately, Annette couldn\u2019t finish her words. It was all because Rafael suddenly bent over and held her up. Annette\u2019s bedroom was just a few steps away. He roughly pushed the door open and headed straight to bed.\u201cAhhh!\u201dAnnette, lying on the bed, looked at him with her eyes wide open. But Rafael didn\u2019t look at her as he was busy taking off his clothes. He ripped off his shirt from his upper body and slid his pants down. As soon as his hands took off his bottoms, his penis popped out, already standing stiff and hard, in all its glory.With an expressionless face, Rafael strode up to her. As his big shadow loomed over her head, Annette was a little scared as she could guess what was about to come. The first time of her previous life was terribly painful, and she was afraid that it might happen again this time.Without making eye contact with her, he immediately began to strip her clothes off. The hand, which was at first trying to be careful, suddenly grew impatient. A crackling sound came from the seams of her clothes due to his rough movements. Annette, startled by the sound, cried unconsciously and hugged his neck tightly.\u201cRafael\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy, didn\u2019t you ask me to check for myself? You don\u2019t mean to ask me to quit now do you?\u201dRafael asked sarcastically and then took off her underwear. Now Annette was completely naked with nothing on. At this rate, it might be as awful as it was in her previous life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her tender breasts grazed against his torso. But she didn\u2019t care about it, as now her fear was greater than her shame. Annette asked Rafael, making her voice seem as pitiful as possible.\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna hurt me, are you? Yes?\u201dRafael didn\u2019t respond. He felt that Annette\u2019s arms tightly holding onto his neck were strangely uncomfortable. The thin, soft hands seemed as if they would break if he applied even a little force. Because of this, Rafael calmed his temper down, even though he was in a state of impatience. His actions became a little gentle. If he hugged someone this weak so roughly, she might die.\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201dHe whispered lowly in a voice clouded by desire. Annette, who was trembling, then slowly let go of his neck. The now free Rafael reached out and swept her legs down and stretched it out like a deer.The texture of the skin on his fingertips was incredibly soft. Her quivering skin, her hair everything smelled ridiculously good.It would not even seem fishy if someone swallowed her whole up. She smelled that good. Even though he had decided to be gentle with her in his head, his hands kept getting rough.At first, he wondered if he could tolerate a Bavarian woman as his wife, but now he didn\u2019t need to worry about that. Rafael clenched his teeth and looked at Annette\u2019s naked body in front of him. Annette\u2019s skin was terribly white, as if she was a woman made of sugar.\u2018If you don\u2019t stand up after looking at such a body, would you be even considered as a boy.\u2019Rafael, with his head down, drew her breasts in his mouth and greedily sucked on them. The nipples, which were initially pale in colour, quickly reacted to the stimulation and heated up like bright red cherries. The tip of his tongue pressed down on her erect nipple and licked it up obscenely. He then gnawed and bit her nipples gently.\u201cAh, ha..ha\u201dAnnette panted and twisted her body. She was afraid that he would bite hard, but on the other hand, she felt a strange thrill between her legs. Her nipples which were persistently bit and licked in his mouth, spread a tingling pleasure throughout her body.After tasting her pudding like sweet breasts, Rafael licked his lips and looked up at her. His deep blue eyes were cold but also strangely hot at this moment. He slowly moved towards her legs, while savouring the texture of her skin and spread her legs wide open.\u201cThis is a little bit embarrassing, Rafael.\u201dAnnette cried and tried to close her legs. It was still afternoon, so the bedroom was bright. Anyone would be able to see her nakedness clearly. She was so ashamed that her eyes turned red. But Rafael only looked down at her nervous action and clasped her thighs and spread it wider.\u201cStay still. Didn\u2019t you ask me to see for myself?\u201dThe words that came out of Rafael\u2019s lips were obscene. When he thought of Annette, who made such a bold proposal with her innocent and pretty face, he felt that he would explode. His penis swelled up painfully as if urging him to go right through Annette\u2019s legs.Annette had no idea of Rafael\u2019s thoughts but she still felt an instinctive sense of crisis. Although she had prepared to go through this, his eyes staring between her legs were so persistent that she was scared. Annette quickly raised her torso and tried to calm him down by carefully kissing his cheeks and forehead.\u201c\u2026.What are you doing? Do you still want to act being nervous?\u201dRafael clenched his teeth and laid her back. However his voice became slightly softer than before. He thought even though it was their first sex, it wouldn\u2019t be bad to be a little gentle. So Rafael with all his patience, lowered his head towards the gap between her legs.Annette\u2019s genitals were very clean. Her radiant labia looked so fragile that he feared it would crush if he touched it. Looking a little closer, her moist vagina trembled with tension and excitement, and glistened in a pretty color. It was such a spectacular sight that he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off it.Annette, who could not bear the shame, turned her head and buried her face in her pillow. Rafael\u2019s breath on her sensitive place made her feel even more ashamed.\u2018With what kind of expression is he looking at her secret place right now?\u2019His forefinger slid over her narrow petals and then opened her up, revealing her entrance. Annette closed her eyes tightly, hoping that this moment would pass as soon as possible. But at that moment, she felt a hot tongue over her nether region.\u201cAhhh! Rafael!\u201dAnnette was startled and raised her head unknowingly to dissuade Rafael. Rafael, in her previous life, came onto her on their first night with a misunderstanding, that she was a woman who lobbied her body. Of course, he didn\u2019t caress her like this and thanks to that, Annette had to lie down for three days on bed.However the current Rafael was a little different. He was trying to reconsider a little about the \u2018false charges\u2019 that Annette had keenly refuted. If she really wasn\u2019t that kind of a woman, then he needed to let her insides loosen enough. Rafael was rather big and naturally, his \u2018assets\u2019 were also dignified.Annette, who did not know of Rafael\u2019s thoughts, covered her face with tears. She was ashamed to death when he licked her vagina. He intentionally spread her legs wider at seeing Annette become shy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The tongue, which had licked up her garden several times, suddenly poked over her sensitive clitoris. His hot lips wrapped around her clit and began to suck it. Then, as the heat rose between her legs, her lower region got wet without her realizing it.\u201cAhh..uh..hum!\u201dHis flexible tongue penetrated her narrow gap and licked her insides tenaciously. Everywhere his tongue touched, an ecstatic thrill spread out. She could feel her inner walls melting and her lower body becoming stiff.Suddenly a finger entered her narrow entrance, making the delicate muscles contract. The thick finger was pushed in deeply, filling her to the brim. Every time it went in and out of her wet hole, it spread her inner walls, and rubbed the back of her sensitive core. Her body seemed to have caught fire.As Annette gasped for breath, the fingers that went in and out of her had already stretched to three.\u201cUhh, s-stop \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201dHer heated vagina swallowed his fingers greedily. His deeply inserted fingers rubbed her inner walls back and forth as if looking around for something. Annette trembled weekly and her body twisted beyond her consciousness. She sobbed and shook her head helplessly.The moment he saw Annette\u2019s wet eyes, the corners of Rafael\u2019s mouth rose dully. His fingers began to move faster and faster, stimulating all her weak spots. Whenever those places were pressed, her waist shook on its own.Gasps of pleasure spilled out of her mouth as her body was racked by an almost unbearable sensation. Rafael leaned back and sucked her erect clitoris. His fingers, which went in and out of her vagina, vigorously rubbed her weak spots.A strange sensation began to simmer, making her toes curl. Her body twisted and arched as she reached the climax. Her body convulsed due to the intense stimulation and then weakly fell onto the bed.\u201cHuh huh\u2026\u201dThe tears that had gathered at the corners of her eyes, rolled down her cheeks. With her flower like red lips wide open and gasping for breath, she looked as if she didn\u2019t know what just happened to her. Looking down at her enchanting and innocent face, Rafael felt an unknown satisfaction.He raised his head, licking her release that dripped down his finger. It tasted like a sour fruit, which turned his appetite even more. His lower body was already agitated with excitement. He hated to admit it, but he was turned on by this woman. And he found this absolutely damnable.Rafael settled between Annette\u2019s legs and pushed his arousal in. His round head squeezed in through her narrow gap, which was still quivering in climax. Annette, feeling the heat of his glans, was startled and suddenly stilled. She clearly remembered the pain of her first time. It was too painful.\u2018I\u2019m scared.\u2019Annette\u2019s big frightened eyes looked up at Rafael. Although she knew she was going to experience this anyway in this life, she still couldn\u2019t help but be scared when it actually came to it. Seeing this, Rafael frowned and raised one hand to cover her eyes. There was something in her eyes that made him feel uselessly weak.His big hand almost covered her whole face, and only her slender chin and red lips could be seen.Rafael who completely blocked her vision, bowed his head and kissed her. His lips greedily wrapped around her tongue and explored her mouth. His tongue gently scratched her sensitive palate and pulled the tip of her tongue.While Annette was distracted by the kiss, Rafael pushed his member in.Despite having climaxed once, her insides were still tight and cramped. So he could only push in half of his length. Nevertheless, it still felt damn good. Her warm inner walls clamped his member tightly and melted all his reasons.\u201cLose your strength, Annette. It\u2019s too tight.\u201dThe evil Rafael rebuked her for this. But Annette didn\u2019t know how to loosen her body and relieve herself of the splitting pain between her legs. She tried, but the tingling pain would not leave. Her body flinched and she groaned in suffering. As she trembled in pain and bit her lips, Rafael clicked his tongue in disapproval. Then he lowered his hand and gently rubbed her swollen clit with his thumb.\u201cUmmm\u2026\u201dFollowing the round gestures of caressing, a familiar pleasure spread out through her body. Annette\u2019s body, which had been stiffened by pain, relaxed a little. Instinctively sensing the moment, Rafael pushed his entire length inside her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It felt as if her stomach was about to explode. It was hard for her to accept his entirety. Feeling the little hole being stretched out to its limit, she was afraid that it might tear any moment. She breathed rapidly, holding on to the sheets for dear life. However Rafael who was immersed in the throes of passion, pretended as if he didn\u2019t see her struggles and began to move his waist.\u201cUghh! Ra\u2026 Rafael! A little slower!\u201dWhenever the thick glans entered and rubbed against her wet inner walls, a dull pain along with a strange pleasure, together arose inside her. Annette with tears in her eyes, unwittingly stretched her hand towards him. But Rafael heartlessly grabbed her hand and pressed it back on the bed. He started moving his hips a little faster. His thrusts suddenly became demanding.The thick penis poked inside her making her eyes flash white. Annette\u2019s breathing became more rapid as he began to stab her weak spots that he found earlier.Rafael still was a man equally as passionate as he was in her previous life.The pain was almost gone now. The feeling of his thick penis rubbing against her sensitive places was so pleasant that it was fascinating. Rafael started to rapidly screw her insides, plunging deep into her womb. Whenever the penis thrusted deep into her innermost recesses, a groan slipped out her mouth.\u201cHa\u2026Aah!\u201dHis big thing pierced her lower body again and again. Her inner walls which were stimulated by his onslaught, cramped and greedily tightened around his penis. She could feel the thickness and the shape of his thing that penetrated her. Suddenly a guttural sound came to her ear. An excited Rafael growled like a male beast, pushing himself deeper inside her.\u201cUghh!\u201dAnnette\u2019s eyes turned white, as her first climax from the insertion started building. Her body quivered due to the intense orgasm. It was so intense that she found it even hard to breathe properly. As her warm insides tightly wrapped around him, Rafael literally lost his mind. He started shoving his thing inside her frantically.As her insides were continuously stimulated, Annette literally thought she was going to die. She sobbed and twisted her body to escape, but Rafael held her hands together and pressed them onto the sheet. Holding on to the beastly man, she cried, as she struggled with the terrible pleasure.Rafael grabbed her ass and thrusted his penis into her deepest parts. Even after ejaculating, he didn\u2019t stop and continuously stimulated her insides with his deep thrusts. Wet smacking sounds filled up the big chamber.Rafael, after relieving his lust once, pulled out his penis. He was going to turn Annette over and do it one more time. It was nice to look down at her pretty doll like face, but looking at her wet eyelashes and lips with teeth marks, he felt strangely uncomfortable.The moment Rafael bowed down his head to turn her over, he smelled blood. Rafael instinctively lowered his gaze to the blood-smelling spot and his sharp eyes widened for the first time, revealing his surprise.It was between Annette\u2019s legs where the blood flowed. Her pale golden pubic hair was messed with their love fluids and blood. Since he had made her relax with his tongue, he didn\u2019t understand why she was bleeding now.Unless what Annette said was really true. Did she really not throw herself at Crown Prince Ludwig to become a princess\u2026. She didn\u2019t seem to be such a vulgar woman. Realising this, Rafael\u2019s eyes shook violently with shock and confusion. Naturally, the thought of continuing the act faded.Annette, who did not notice the change in Rafael\u2019s heart, closed her eyes in dread. Rafael was a very energetic man, and never finished once or twice in her previous life. He was a beastly man who would not let her go even if she cried and crawled away. He would drag her back and re-insert his raging length from the back. Therefore, Annette thought he would do it once more.\u2018What should I do? It hurts a little\u2026\u2019Annette was worried. In the middle of the act, she didn\u2019t know because of the pleasure, but the pain in her lower body was gradually becoming bitter. As expected, the first time turned out to be painful. Annette was worried about his reaction if she said she didn\u2019t want to do it anymore. So she looked up at him carefully.However Rafael didn\u2019t come at her as she expected. Annette was puzzled. Unexpectedly, Rafael\u2019s gaze was fixed, as if nailed between her legs. The moments she saw his trembling eyes, Annette realized what happened. He had only now realised that her words were true.Rafael silently let go of his hand holding Annette. Then he turned back and stepped down from the bed. The gesture was somewhat sad and quite different from usual.The moment she saw this, Annette instinctively realized that this was her opportunity. She decided to take advantage of this and make Rafael reflect on his roguish behaviour.\u201cI told you, didn\u2019t I!\u2026.It\u2019s really too much.\u201dAnnette said resentfully. The moment he heard her voice, the muscles of his back turned hard. Because of the shock he was already feeling guilty and now hearing Annette\u2019s resentment, his guilt doubled.Rafael\u2019s eyebrows furrowed and he bit his tongue gently. It was because words of apology almost slipped out of his mouth. However, the first thing to do here before apologizing was to grasp the situation. Was Annette really framed? When the premise that he believed turned out to be false, all Rafael was left was with terrible confusion.Fortunately, the hatred that he had forgotten came back and corrected his reasoning. He glared at Annette\u2019s blonde locks and made up his mind. Bavarians were cunning people with blue blood flowing through their veins. Rafael, who recalled this, replied coldly.\u201cOkay. I admit that you did not throw yourself at Prince Ludwig. But that\u2019s all.\u201dAnnette immediately understood what he was talking about. In fact, the accusation of throwing herself at the Crown Prince was not very much. They were almost engaged at that time, and Annette was really on the verge of becoming a Crown Princess. So even if the charming ladies of Deltium talked and gossiped about it, the talks about engagement was enough to make everyone close their eyes.In fact, there was another charge which destroyed Annette\u2019s future. But Rafael wisely didn\u2019t say anything about it. It was a secret that only the three families knew. Judging from the guests\u2019 reaction at the wedding hall, fortunately the \u2018secret\u2019 seemed to be well kept.\u2018It remains to be seen whether that is true or not.\u2019Rafael thought coldly and turned his head. It was only to check whether Annette was shocked by his words. However, Rafael soon regretted his hasty action.The naked body of a woman which still held the traces of their love affairs was very stimulating. Annette\u2019s cheeks which were as white as a porcelain doll, were flushed and appeared like blooming flowers. The sight of her breasts sticking out of her long blonde hair, was enough to make all his blood flow towards his nether regions. What stimulated Rafael the most was the white semen flowing down between Annette\u2019s legs. A mixture of love juices and a little blood, looked terribly lewd and erotic. However, the worst part of all this was Annette\u2019s eyes, which looked at him naively in the midst of all this.\u201cRafael\u2026\u201dAnnette didn\u2019t know what kind of thoughts were going through Rafael\u2019s mind. She simply called him, wondering how to clarify her charges. Annette raised her head and was confused when she saw his dark face.\u2018Why are you looking at me like that?\u2019\u2018Maybe he wants to do it one more time.\u2019Annette trembled at the ominous possibility. The pain between her legs was too unbearable to do it once more. Since there was no evidence to prove her innocence right now, she thought it would be better to explain it to him next time.What was more important right now was to somehow calm down the excited Rafael.Annette quickly cried out and appealed to Rafael in a small voice.\u201cI\u2019m sick, Rafael. My legs are in so much pain. So let\u2019s stop for now.\u201dRafael\u2019s gaze once again shifted towards the between of her legs. At that moment, as if on good timing, the body fluids dripped down her white legs. Seeing this, Rafael hardened his face and ran out of the bedroom.Bang!The door closed making a harsh noise. Judging from the force with which he slammed the door, it seemed as if Rafael was very angry. The door shuddered and made a ringing sound. Annette was so surprised that she couldn\u2019t even scream and grabbed her chest unknowingly. That wicked habit of slamming the door absolutely needed to be fixed.However, Rafael, who had already run out of the room, was unaware of this. He strode down the hall, constantly trying to empty his mind. But it didn\u2019t go well.\u201cFucking Bavarians! Damn Annette Bavaria!\u201dThe image of a naked Annette flashed before his eyes. He couldn\u2019t get that pretty and sexy image of her out of his mind. His sexual desire, which had not yet been completely doused, rose hot and fast again in him, urging him to go back to Annette. Even if Annette was sick or crying, it would be great to crush her slender body under him and indulge in her to his heart\u2019s desire.But Rafael wondered why he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed Rafael didn\u2019t like her because he didn\u2019t seem to want to be with her even for a second. Anyway she was used to his cold attitude, but him doing this right after they did such an intimate act, she felt a little sad.\u2018Well, if you think about it, Rafael hates me.\u2019Annette looked back at her previous life. How much did he hate her, to not even sleep with her on the same bed for five years? Rafael always went away like this every time after they had sex. There was no way such a man would suddenly become affectionate just because he indulged in her once.Annette decided not to be too depressed. She had gone through death and even come back alive, it doesn\u2019t matter if her husband\u2019s still cold to her. There would be no disappointment if she didn\u2019t expect anything from him in the first place. So everything will become comfortable if she emptied her mind of all such worries.In fact, Annette\u2019s biggest enemy was not Rafael, but mental stress. Even though she had returned back in the past and improved her health a bit, she had always been quite delicate in her previous life. Because of this, stress easily harmed her health and in the end, she died at an early age of twenty because of her illness. Annette was not willing to die like that again.\u2018But there are certainly some things better than before.\u2019For example her first time. Although Rafael bit and sucked her like a beast, her body didn\u2019t feel much pain. It was a big improvement compared to her first night in her previous life. It was so harsh that she had to lay on her bed sick for three days. Annette was slowly changing her future little by little.\u2018Yes, I can do it.\u2019Annette hugged the blanket and made up her mind. In this life, she wanted to get rid of her false charges and get along with Rafael if possible. If Rafael really hated her that much, then she would consider to divorce him. Because now Annette was not a passive woman like her former self. She was a woman who had gone through a miracle and come back to life after experiencing death.It was just then that the door of the bedroom which had been tightly closed, opened making a creaking sound. Annette got surprised and quickly covered herself up with the blanket. Fortunately it was the man whom she was considering to divorce a moment ago.\u201cRafael?\u201dAnnette was a little stunned to see him. She didn\u2019t expect he would come back. Strangely Rafael looked angry for some reason. Seeing him like this, Annette for a moment was worried whether he read her thoughts.\u2018Did you hear my thoughts?\u2019Of course Rafael didn\u2019t hear her thoughts. He only came back to her bedroom for purely different reasons. Rafael who came up to Annette, put something on the side table, making a loud clang sound.Annette wondered what it was and curiously looked at the side table. What Rafael put down was a flat bowl. It seemed there was hot water in it as she could see steam rising from it. There was also a soft cloth draped over the side of the bowl.\u2018Oh, my God.\u2019After seeing this, Annette opened her eyes widely. Could it be that Rafael brought all this for her. When he met her bewildered eyes, Rafael\u2019s expression became more grim. As he reached out his hand towards her, Annette thought he was coming on her again. But the large hand that stopped in front of her nose held a glass of water.\u201cThis, what is this? Rafael?\u201dAnnette asked. As she was struck by Rafael\u2019s ferocious spirit, she reflexively received the cup of water. Then he replied in a bad tone as if he was chewing out every word.\u201cYou said you were sick.\u201dOnly then did Annette\u2019s gaze lowered to the bottom of the cup.She found some pure white powder at the bottom. Maybe he brought her some painkiller. Annette was really grateful, but seeing his hideous face it seemed he was offering her poison instead of painkillers. Still she was grateful for his unexpected consideration. Annette surprised by Rafael\u2019s actions, was speechless for a moment.Rafael frowned and looked at Annette nervously. He couldn\u2019t understand why he was doing something that didn\u2019t suit him. But Annette\u2019s complains of \u2018It hurts\u2019 strangely bothered him. Why does this fine woman look so weak?So he gave her some painkillers, but she just sat there blankly holding the glass of water. It seemed she didn\u2019t even want to drink what he had given her.\u2018Why did you do such a useless thing!\u2019Rafael\u2019s pride was hurt. Annoyed by this, he tried to take the cup back from Annette\u2019s hand. But Annette was one step faster. Annette got up from her bed, put the cup of water on the table and hugged his waist.\u201cThank you very much, Rafael.\u201dAnnette raised her head slightly while hugging him and smiled softly at him. Her finely folded golden eyelashes fluttered, and beneath them, her petal like pink eyes twinkled with laughter. It was a pretty smile, like a blooming flower.Seeing this, Rafael was irritated that he still seemed to want the Bavarian woman. The feeling of her dainty hands around his waist and her dazzling smile as she looked up at him were very unfamiliar to him. He quickly turned around to escape from the awkward embrace. He did everything he could for her, so he was going to let her rest.Rafael was afraid he would hurt her again if he didn\u2019t leave this room immediately. So without even looking back he quickly left her bedroom. Looking at his cold back, Annette still greeted him politely\u201cGoodnight, Rafael!\u201dOf course there was no answer from him. It was okay, though. After taking the painkillers he brought, Annette reached out to the bowl. She felt her pain lessen as she wiped the area between her legs with the soft cloth soaked in warm water. Naturally, Annette\u2019s heart also warmed up.\u2018I didn\u2019t know Rafael would do this.\u2019Annette smiled softly. \u2018Well if you think about it, it wasn\u2019t always bad with Rafael.\u2019In her previous life, Rafael worked quite hard to provide her with medical care until the day she died. After Annette was bedridden, he stopped arguing with her and personally took care of her. Rafael was very sensitive to the physical pain of others, perhaps because he had been through war.Annette, who had wiped herself to some extent, laid back on the bed. The painkillers began to take effect and the pain slowly started to subside. As she laid alone on the big bed, she felt a little cold and lonely, but it was still fine. Even in the vague dark future, she could see the light of hope growing little by little.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There seemed to be some dispute as she could hear Rafael quarrelling and ranting in the middle.Annette rubbed her sleepy eyes and looked out of the window, but she could see no-one standing there. Judging from the direction where the sound was coming, it seemed to be coming from the foyer.Annette got up from her bed and decided to go out. She was now the wife of the Marquis of Carnesis, so she needed to keep track of all the fuss happening in the mansion.As she walked a few steps to go down the floor, she felt a slight burning pain between her legs. But this was tolerable. Annette, who had been rigorously educated to be the Crown Princess, was very patient. Annette quickly dressed up and nervously looked at the direction of the discord.\u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019As Annette left the room, she tried to remember what happened at this time in her previous life. However she couldn\u2019t think of anything because Annette in her previous life was sick and bedridden at this time.Rafael hated her at the beginning of their honeymoon. The misunderstanding on their first night was terrible, and Annette suffered from the aftermath. At that time, she was so foolish that she couldn\u2019t even say easy words like, \u2018Please don\u2019t let me get sick.\u2019 If she had said that, she wouldn\u2019t have suffered so much.The price of stupid stubbornness was three days of illness and helplessness. When she opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was Rafael\u2019s dark face, coldly glaring at her. He acted as if she was his enemy. He didn\u2019t even seem to feel sorry for his sick wife who had ended up like this because of him.\u2018I was really sad back then\u2026\u2019Annette frowned at the unpleasant memory. From then on, she also hated him earnestly. She could not understand why Rafael hated her. He didn\u2019t believe her at all whenever she tried to clear the misunderstandings. At that time he was just as cold as her father, even more cruel than him.But this time she had a completely different first night. Though Rafael still behaved very awfully, he did consider Annette\u2019s convenience this time. Thanks to this, Annette woke up as usual and was able to notice this current uproar.\u2018I hope it\u2019s not a big deal.\u2019Annette\u2019s heart pounded because of an unknown anxiety. Naturally her steps towards the foyer became a little faster. As soon as she turned around the corner of the corridor, she heard Rafael\u2019s voice from afar.\u201c\u2026.So you mean, the gifts I\u2019ve sent you are very lacking in the eyes of the Bavarian old man?\u201dRafael yelled out. Although he asked in a low ridiculing voice, Annette could sense his anger from it. She knew she didn\u2019t have to face him to know that he was in his worst mood right now. She had hardly seen him this angry.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Marquis of Carnesis. The gifts you sent are wonderful\u2026 but my master is a person who is only familiar with the finest quality products. I would like to ask for your generous understanding of the difference of opinions that may arise between the two families.\u201dAnnette listened to the noble voice that followed. It was a voice she knew very well. It was Gerard, the butler of her family. He had a classy tone of speech with a little foreign accent. Gerard had a gentle impression on her and was a pretty good butler.However Annette frowned on seeing him. It was because what Gerard just said came into her mind.\u2018Gerard is a little weird today. Why is he talking to Rafael that way? It\u2019s quite rude.\u2019She didn\u2019t understand why Gerard, her family butler, was speaking down to Rafael in a very rude tone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/How to Tame My Beastly HusbandChapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGerard was a very promising butler. He was quite able, which earned him the grace of the Duke of Bavaria. Coming from a foreign noble family, he possessed perfect manners and good looks. Gerard was a good butler, and Annette had received a lot of meticulous care from him since childhood.\u2018But that\u2019s it. I can\u2019t stand by and watch him be rude to my husband.\u2019Annette bit her lips and approached the front door. She saw Gerard standing straight, looking as graceful and calm as ever. However, Annette found the problem at once. It was his attitude that was now quite different from what she had known before.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with his posture?\u2019Gerard looked very proud and confident, with his back erect and head held up straight. On the surface, it didn\u2019t look like much of a problem but his posture was quite disrespectful considering who he was standing before. It was none other than in front of Marquis Rafael Carnesis. No way Gerard wouldn\u2019t know such basic manners. So it must have been done deliberately.Seeing this, Annette frowned and walked out to the front door. Rafael, who was quite sensitive to his surroundings, sensed her presence and looked back first. Following his gaze, Gerard also looked that way. Seeing who was standing there, his eyes widened slightly.\u201cGood morning, Marchioness of Carnesis.\u201d\u201cGerard.\u201dGerard recognized Annette immediately and bowed his head politely. Apparently, Gerard\u2019s neck only bowed before people of Bavaria. Seeing this, Rafael\u2019s deep blue eyes became narrow. He wondered whether his neck could continue to be stiff before him if he cut it off from his body.Annette, who had already grasped Rafael to some extent, was stung by his bloody gaze. To prevent him from taking any irrevocable step, she quickly cleared her throat and asked Gerard.\u201cGerard, what\u2019s going on? Why are you making a fuss so early in the morning?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Madam. I just came here to fulfill the Duke\u2019s command. I couldn\u2019t complete the work smoothly. So, I apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused you.\u201dGerard said politely while bowing his back. He no longer called Annette \u2018Lady\u2019. Well this was the right title to address her, since Annette was now married. She had not seen him since her marriage, so she felt a little strange for a while. But Annette quickly adapted to the change and immediately refuted Gerard\u2019s words.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re here to fulfill your orders. But Gerard, since how many years have you been serving the House of Bavaria?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been 12 years now, Young Lady\u2026um Marchioness.\u201d Gerard, who belatedly corrected the habitual title, was sweating. He was right now very embarrassed by Annette\u2019s sudden appearance.In a fight, the first one to be distracted was bound to lose. Annette, who had already won the game, began to reprimand Gerard in earnest.\u201c12 years! That\u2019s enough time to learn etiquettes. But what\u2019s with your attitude towards my husband, Gerard? If someone sees how you\u2019re behaving right now, they might think you\u2019re the master here.\u201d\u201cMadam, that\u2019s not it. Sorry, I think there\u2019s a misunderstanding regarding this situation, but I\u2019m\u2026\u201dGerard was very flustered and hurried to correct Annette\u2019s misunderstanding. However, Annette was not a person who could be easily swayed by a butler\u2019s eloquence. She was also from the Bavarian family, so it was as natural as breathing for her to correct the discipline of her employees.Annette raised her head in a haughty way and lashed out at the butler who was comparatively quite taller than her.\u201cWhat misunderstanding! I saw it with my own eyes! How could you be so rude to my husband, Gerard? Are you saying that just because I got married, you don\u2019t see me as your master anymore? So there\u2019s no need to be polite to me and my husband?\u201dAs she spoke, it seemed as if she would explode from her anger and sadness. Annette only blamed Gerard on the surface, because she knew the actual truth. Gerard didn\u2019t do this because he looked down upon Rafael. He was originally an exemplary butler who knew how to politely entertain the guests even if it was the commoners who came to visit the Ducal house.\u2018Gerard is probably doing this right now\u2026 because my father ordered it.\u2019Annette\u2019s father, Allamand Bavaria, was a terrible supremacist. He openly ignored Rafael even before Annette\u2019s marriage because Rafael was an illegitimate child of the royal family. No matter how pure and high the royal blood flowing in him was, it was never ignored that the blood of his mother was vulgar and from unknown origins.This contempt of Allamand continued even after Rafael became his son-in-law. Because of this, Annette who was inexperienced, struggled to mediate between her father and her husband. But she never thought something like this would have happened.\u2018This is so mean!\u2019\u2018Why did you marry me off to Rafael if you didn\u2019t want to treat him like a son-in-law in the first place?\u2019Annette resented her cold and selfish father. Thanks to this, Annette\u2019s pink eyes became a little teary. She couldn\u2019t see Rafael\u2019s expression standing behind her, so she glared at Gerard spitefully.When Gerard saw Annette\u2019s teary eyes, he hung his head in a daze. He was very vulnerable to the weak look of his young lady.\u201cNo, Madam, I apologize for my rudeness. Please forgive me with a generous heart.\u201d\u201cApologise to my husband, not me.\u201dHearing Annette\u2019s firm command, Gerard closed his mouth with a difficult expression. His green eyes were stubbornly neglecting Rafael\u2019s existence. Gerard could never apologize to Rafael, as long as he had been instructed by his master. Instead, Gerard decided to try to somehow persuade Annette.\u2018If you\u2019re the lady I served, you\u2019d take my side. If you\u2019re just saying it\u2026\u2019The lady whom Gerard had served, though clever, was rather weak-minded. Gerard clung to that point. Now that her husband was in front of her, she pretended to scold Gerard. He has known her for so many years, so he thought it was an attempt worth trying.Gerard gulped and began speaking in a distinct elegant tone.\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, I visited you on the occasion of a formal visit by the Duke of Bavaria. There seems to be a misunderstanding, but please understand that my actions do not contain any personal intention. All of this was by Duke of Bavaria\u2026.\u201dAnnette was immersed in her thoughts while listening to Gerard\u2019s fluent excuse. As expected, her suspicions that her father had ordered to do this was right. Allamand must have done this with an intention to demoralise Rafael and to clearly show that he refused to acknowledge him as his son in law. Instead of letting him think Annette was married to him, he wanted Rafael to know Annette was rather thrown away to him.\u2018So you\u2019re openly ignoring Rafael so much. You didn\u2019t even consider the position of your daughter who was married to him.\u2019A bitter smile emerged on Annette\u2019s face. She couldn\u2019t believe her father sent a butler to insult his son-in-law who was also a nobleman. Because of this Rafael was angry and cold towards her. This showed her how selfish her father was and how he didn\u2019t care about her at all.In fact, even when Annette was having a hard time during her marriage in her previous life, her father only kept his distance and stayed on the sides. It stayed like that until the day she died at a young age. The last time Annette saw her father was the day of her wedding, and that too, he had only attended to satisfy the king.It was then Annette realized that she had been abandoned by her father. Being unable to become a Crown Princess, she became useless to Allamand. But it was not surprising. Her father was cold-blooded, with blue blood flowing in his veins. So it was time for the abandoned daughter to make choices for herself.\u2018Rafael is my husband. And now he\u2019s\u2026 my only family.\u2019It was a sad truth. Rafael was her husband, and she was obliged to protect her husband. Although she couldn\u2019t do that in her previous life, it would be different this time. Annette\u2019s pink determined eyes elegantly looked down at the butler.\u201cOkay, Gerard. Then tell me with your own mouth. I too, have the Bavarian blood flowing in my veins, and even after marriage, my middle name will contain Bavaria in it. Then, am I, who is standing in front of you, your master or not?\u201dUnexpectedly, Annette\u2019s resolute attitude left Gerard feeling stifled. Annette, who had a lofty chin and cold eyes, was currently more Bavarian than anyone else. Seeing this, Gerard realized that she had no intention of compromising.\u201cMadam has always been a Bavarian, and will continue to be so. I am loyal to the House of Bavaria, and I have devoted my whole life to its noble lineage.\u201dGerard gave Anette the answer she wanted in a quivering voice. After all, he had never gone against his young lady. From the moment he first saw a young Annette broadly smiling at him, Gerard was desperately defeated and he always gave in to her.\u201cGood. Then, I would like you to apologize to my husband, who deserves respect.\u201dAnnette raised her head straight as she clasped her hands around Rafael\u2019s arms. Her figure looked quite haughty and arrogant. Rafael thought this image of Annette was rather strange, but it wasn\u2019t surprisingly bad. To be honest, he also seemed to like it.\u2018I never thought I\u2019d see a Bavarian taking my side in my life.\u2019Rafael felt indescribably strange. He had always been alone. He had to climb fiercely from the bottom to the top all alone. And he always took it for granted. Even his own biological father, King Selgratis, would not have recognized him as his son if he did not have talent. That was the heartless world that Rafael knew.But suddenly in his life, a woman named Annette Bavaria appeared. She didn\u2019t let Rafael solve the problem \u2018directly\u2018 in his own style. Instead, she stood in front of him with her slender body, and even scolded the butler that was sent by her own family, by saying, \u2018How dare you disrespect my husband?\u2019It was the first time in his life, Rafael had ever experienced \u2018protection\u2019 of others. Unbelievably, he was now protected by a woman who barely reached his shoulder. And on top of that, she was the daughter of the Bavarian family, who despised Rafael\u2019s very existence. This was all a really fresh shock to Rafael.\u2018Strange woman.\u2019Rafael glanced at Annette and then turned his gaze to the butler. He could see Gerard looking at himself from the distance, with a pale face. In Rafael\u2019s eyes, this impolite butler seemed to like Annette. Only a man could better know the heart of the other man.Gerard\u2019s arrogance came from the fact that he was backed by the Duke Allamand Bavaria. But it was clear that his hostile feelings towards Rafael were his own. And he knew very well where they came from. Gerard bowed his head to Rafael with a frustrated face and at the order of his young lady, he politely apologized.\u201cI politely apologize for my rudeness, Your Excellency, Marquis of Carnesis. Please forgive me.\u201dRafael stared at Gerard\u2019s bowed head with cold eyes. He wanted to make an example by teaching the butler a lesson for his insolence. But it was obvious that if he made an employee from his wife\u2019s house like that, he would never hear the end of it and would be scorned by the public. Annette will be portrayed as a poor victim and he will be described as a ruthless butcher. It\u2019s better to show mercy once than to hear such things.Above all, Rafael honestly didn\u2019t expect Annette to raise her voice like this and give him face. Since she did a great job as a wife, he also had to consider his position as her husband.The determined Rafael opened his mouth coldly. \u201cHey, did you say your name was Gerard?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This time I\u2019ll forgive you because of my wife, but I will not give the same mercy twice.\u201dRafael glowered at Gerard as a warning. Noticing Rafael\u2019s warning, a cold sweat broke out on Gerard\u2019s forehead. Rafael was still able to breathe fire, even after just being woken up from his sleep. The fear of the beast of a man, standing in front of him, made him feel dizzy.Only then did Gerard realise the sheer danger that Rafael posed. It seemed that the rumours that he was an outstanding swordsman, enough to reach the level of Sword Master soon were indeed true. Until a few years ago, he was a brutal butcher who was called the \u2018demon of the battlefield\u2019.Gerard\u2019s spine soon became cold as ice. He realised that Rafael\u2019s warning of \u2018I will not give the same mercy twice\u2019 was true. Even now his fiery eyes were shining brightly and were focusing on Gerard\u2019s hands and legs, as if wondering which side he should first cut. The moment Gerard realized this, his jaw briefly twitched.\u201cTha\u2026thank you for your generosity, Your Excellency, Marquis of Carnesis.\u201dThis time, Gerard, who gave a polite and cordial greeting from his heart, hurriedly left as if he was running away. \u2018If I go back like this, I\u2019ll be in trouble with my master, but at this moment\u2026 that\u2019s quite acceptable.\u2019 Feeling the sinister gaze on his back, Gerard quickly dragged his limbs that weren\u2019t moving and hurried to escape from the mansion.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNow the only people left in the foyer were Annette and Rafael. Annette felt Rafael\u2019s scorching gaze on her. She nervously swallowed her saliva, raised her trembling eyes and then looked up at him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rafael. You felt bad, didn\u2019t you?\u201dAnnette was deeply depressed by what just happened, so she frankly apologized to Rafael. She pretended to be bold, but in fact, she was so surprised that her heart was pounding wildly. In her previous life, she was sick because of the first night, so she didn\u2019t know something like this had happened. Her own family had ignored and disrespected Rafael so badly.Annette now finally realised why Rafael was so cold to her when she woke up in her previous life. He had been terribly insulted by her family while she was sick. She was sorry for hating him and calling him cold-blooded without knowing what had happened.Fortunately, Rafael\u2019s eyes, which looked down on Annette, were no longer blazing with fire. He accepted Annette\u2019s apology without being sarcastic or angry at her.\u201cI don\u2019t really care.\u201dRafael calmly lied about it even though he was just planning to dismember Gerard. When he recalled Annette\u2019s small body lashing out at her loyal, hard-working butler, he felt his anger cool down. Actually, he thought it was a bit fun.However, he didn\u2019t have any intention to let this go. Although Annette sided with him, he had no idea how she would have acted behind his back. Rafael\u2019s hatred and distrust towards the people of Bavaria were that deep. He spat out harsh words at Annette who was looking up at him.\u201cIt seems the people of Bavaria should really pay attention to educate their servants in proper manners. What happened just now was unacceptable.\u201dRafael thought maybe Annette would get angry after hearing what he said. The people of the Bavarian family were arrogant to their bones and their pride was as high as the sky. But Annette\u2019s reaction was very unexpected.\u201cI know. Well, they\u2019ll take care of it themselves. Now I\u2019m a part of the House of Carnesis.\u201dAnnette replied, recalling her father who abandoned her. In her previous life, she couldn\u2019t get out of the shadow of being his good daughter, but this time she had no intention of doing that again. Rafael, who complained and cared for her until the end, was more family to her than her father, who never showed his face until the day she died.However Rafael seemed rather surprised to hear Annette\u2019s answer. His cold expression in front of her crumbled for the first time, revealing his honest feelings to her. Annette, on seeing this, somehow felt a little closer to him. As she was in the mood, she looked up at Rafael and asked him with a pitiful expression.\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of getting rid of me now, right? I just fought with my family and now I have nowhere to go.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking nonsense.\u201dRafael held a straight face at her joke. It was clear that he still had no intention of accepting Annette as his family. But Annette wasn\u2019t particularly hurt. In a way, this could have become a serious family conflict, but she was grateful that Rafael had let go of his anger.\u201cSo why did Gerard come here? I thought he was running errands earlier.\u201dAnnette tilted her head, recalling the purpose of Gerard\u2019s visit that she had forgotten for a while. Then Rafael raised his hand with an expressionless face and pointed somewhere. It was where Gerard had been standing before. There were a lot of luxurious boxes piled up there.Annette wondered what those boxes were, so she looked closely at them. The logo engraved with gold foil on its packaging stood out.They were all logos of famous workshops in the Deltium. Most of them dealt with wedding gifts as main products.\u201cNo way\u2026Don\u2019t tell me those.\u201dAnnette\u2019s eyes widened. Come to think of it, the shapes of the boxes seemed familiar. Annette\u2019s cheeks paled when she realized something. Those boxes that were piled up on the ground now\u2026were probably wedding presents. They were all precious and rare gifts that Rafael had sent to her family before the marriage.\u2018Now\u2026 Did you just return the wedding gifts sent by your son-in-law?\u2019At this point, Gerard\u2019s rudeness comparatively felt rather trivial.Annette gasped at the contempt of her own family that was beyond imagination. \u2018How can you return the gifts that Rafael had sent with all his love?\u2019 She had never heard anything about this in her previous life. Rafael, who opened his mouth just in time, confirmed Annette\u2019s suspicions.\u201cYour father rejected the gifts because they were lacking in his eyes. These things don\u2019t fit the Bavarian Duke\u2019s standards. It seems they\u2019re not useful to him. So he sent them all back.\u201dStanding with his arms folded, Rafael groaned. Now that she saw him properly, she could see he was dressed in a loose outfit with its front unbuttoned and his deep blue eyes were bloodshot. It seemed he didn\u2019t sleep well last night. In such a state, he experienced such a turmoil so early in the morning, so Annette had nothing to say to him even if he hated and blamed her at this point.Annette was very upset. It was ridiculous to question the utility of a wedding gift. It was clear that he intended to brutally insult Rafael and break his spirit. Her father, Allamand, was a character who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do something like this.\u2018If I had known it would be like this, I\u2019d rather not have agreed to the marriage.\u2019The more she thought about it, the more angry and sad she became. Annette\u2019s false accusation prevented her from becoming a Crown Princess. Fortunately, Annette\u2019s family took care of it, but in the process, she had to take care of the royal family. In a word, to bury this matter for once and for all, her father, Allamand married her off to Rafael. So he abandoned his own daughter, in an attempt to satisfy the king.King Selgratis cared about the illegitimate status of Rafael. So in order to make up for his poor lineage, the king tried to marry him with a lady of a prestigious family. Just in time, Annette, who was \u2018framed\u2019, had become the best choice for it.Her father must have been very displeased with this wedding. But instead of directly turning down the king who proposed this wedding, Allamand chose to insult the easy Rafael. Annette thought this was very cowardly of her father.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Rafael. I don\u2019t have the face to see you. I\u2026I\u2019ll make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again next time.\u201dRafael loosened his arms and looked at Annette, who was apologizing. With her head bowed down, he couldn\u2019t see her face, but listening to her voice, he could feel her sincere apology. Her desperate voice and bent neck were enough to soften his wicked self.Rafael thought he shouldn\u2019t just let it go here. Even though Annette seemed to be reflecting on her family\u2019s behaviour, she was still a member of the Bavarian family. You never know when she would cunningly change her stance and take sides with her father.Therefore, Rafael opened his mouth to scold Annette. But strangely enough, he couldn\u2019t think of any mean words to say to her.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with me?\u2019Rafael frowned for a moment and looked down at Annette\u2019s small head. In the end, only a perfunctory warning came out of his mouth.\u201cMake sure that this doesn\u2019t happen in the future again. Do you understand me?\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dRafael left the room after saying this. Annette turned sadly and looked at Rafael\u2019s back. She thought he was going to get upset with her, but unexpectedly he didn\u2019t say anything. It was a miracle that it ended like this. At least, she hoped that when she had openly sided with him, his heart softened towards her a little.Annette, who was left alone, blinked her eyes a couple of times and sighed heavily. She had just declared to cut off all her ties with her family, but surprisingly she did not regret it. It was her father who let go off her first anyway.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It was a good decision.\u201dAnnette comforted herself. She married Rafael and now was his wife. So of course, it was right to side with him. Although Rafael was an illegitimate child, he was still a nobleman and a war hero who was recognized by the royal family. No matter how big and powerful the Duke of Bavaria was, he had no right to insult Rafael like this.There was only one strange part. Annette blinked and pondered.\u201cBut why bother sending the gifts back?\u201dAnnette felt that somehow, her father might be hiding another intention\u2026..a very insidious intention.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The blue-blooded Bavarians never wasted their time on useless things. \u2018If you did this simply to insult Rafael, then instead of sending the gifts back, you should have just thrown them away.\u2019With a deep sigh, Annette decided to keep a close eye on her father for the time being. She didn\u2019t know what he was actually up to, but she couldn\u2019t let him continue looking down on Rafael like this. Just the thought of the treatment Rafael had received from her father today made her furious.\u2018It was you who had sent me to get married to Rafael and now, you\u2019re not even treating him like a son-in-law. That\u2019s just too irresponsible!\u2019Although Rafael was an illegitimate child, he was the illegitimate child of the royal family. Even the present king, Selgratis, was known to care for Rafael quite a bit. Because of this, Crown Prince Ludwig was very antagonistic to Rafael. Although Ludwig was the heir to the official royal family, and Rafael was just an illegitimate child.Perhaps the reason why Annette\u2019s father neglected Rafael was also because of the Prince. Ludwig would surely become the next king. Although he had no choice but to accept Rafael as his son-in-law, to win Ludwig\u2019s favour, he was so cold hearted that he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to break his ties with Rafael.Annette understood her father\u2019s position in her mind. But emotionally, it was unacceptable for her. Even though he knew she was falsely accused, he married her off just like that, as if he was kicking her out, and he even treated her husband Rafael poorly. Feeling a strong rage over her father\u2019s behaviour, Annette clenched her teeth.***It was a very noisy morning. After completing his swordsmanship training without any rest, Rafael entered the mansion with his sweaty body. Last night, he fell asleep while drinking, so he was in a terrible condition. Neither his sword-wielding arms nor his legs were moving smoothly. Nevertheless, it was not a good idea to take a break from the practice.Apart from his private life, Rafael had never neglected a single day of sword training. Until the illegitimate son of the king, who was nothing, rose and became the Marquis of the Carnesis. The only thing that was protecting him was his ability with swords. Rafael\u2019s eyes were dark as he took off his shirt and wiped his sweaty body.\u201cWhy the hell isn\u2019t it working today?\u201dAlthough it seemed that he had almost reached the level of the Sword Master, in truth he hadn\u2019t. It was so suffocating as if he had been blocked by an invisible wall. \u2018If anyone could tell me the direction, I would give him a thousand gold coins. Will it be better if I don\u2019t drink alcohol? But that\u2019s impossible.\u2019\u201cDamn it!\u201dRafael couldn\u2019t control his anger and frustration. He flung aside the towel and headed to the window. Whenever he was in a bad mood, he enjoyed looking at the view through the open window of his mansion. Gazing at the magnificent mansion and the vast gardens, which he had acquired himself, made him feel much better.However today, even this wonderful scenery could not calm his heart. His hawk like eyes found a little woman sitting in the garden. Annette Bavaria. Another trophy he had won, just like the Carnesis Mansion.Technically speaking, her last name was now Carnesis. However, Rafael had not yet accepted her as his family. She was nothing but an accessory to the disgusting Duke of Bavaria. For him, she was just something that was a little peculiar .Rafael narrowed his eyes and looked at Annette, who seemed as small as his finger. She was sitting on a bench and looking intently at some books.\u2018Is this a trick to get my attention?\u2019Rafael\u2019s blue eyes stared coldly. Standing by the window in his room, he could see the bench where Annette was sitting very well. It was definitely a deliberate act of the Bavarian woman.Wearing a light green off-shoulder dress and with her shiny blonde hair braided behind her back, Annette certainly was an eye-catching figure. \u2018If you bite that pure white shoulder, a pale pink tooth mark will remain.\u2019 In his eyes, Annette looked like a very exquisite and expensive porcelain doll. She was like a high-end product that an illegitimate child like him could never have.Rafael was unfamiliar with the fact that she was now his wife. However, Annette herself seemed to believe that she now already belonged to the Carnesis family. The corners of Rafael\u2019s mouth curled upwards when he recalled the quarrel she had with the Bavarian butler.\u201cApologize to my husband who deserves respect! Huh! Anyway, you\u2019re really a cunning woman.\u201dRafael sarcastically tried to denigrate Annette\u2019s intentions in his heart, but strangely, the risen corners of his mouth were not going back down. The impudent butler of the Bavarian family seemed very despondent at the sight of Annette taking his side. The thought of it made him feel better.Actually, even Rafael didn\u2019t expect that Annette would take his side. Well, maybe it was just a pretense of the cunning Bavarian woman, but it was strangely quite satisfactory. Rafael\u2019s eyes, as he stared at Annette outside the window, softened a little.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Annette reflexively raised her hand and swept her windswept hair away from her face. Her blond hair glistened with a light platinum color, just like a flax thread on a cloudy day. As her view became clearer, the passage of the book she had read before caught her eye.\u2018\u2026Regression is an extremely rare experience, but once you regress, you may acquire a special ability that you never had before. A prime example is the prodigal daughter Natalie, who had the ability to attract men by releasing special pheromones after returning. In this way, regressors acquire rare abilities one by one, ranging from spirit skills to the ability to make sugar cubes at a small level.\u2019Annette snorted a little at the phrase \u2018the ability to make sugar cubes\u2019.However her mind became complicated. It was because of the thought of what her special ability could be. \u2018I hope it\u2019s not making french fries out of the nostrils.\u2019 Annette did not like fried foods very much .\u2018Whatever it is, please, I wish it is a helpful ability.\u2019Unfortunately, this book did not say when and how the regressors came to realize their new abilities. In the first place, there were too few known cases of regression. Annette couldn\u2019t hide her disappointment and looked back to see if there was anything she missed.At that moment, a sudden gust of wind blew away the book she was reading. At the same time, the hem of Annette\u2019s dress flipped over. A surprised Annette hurried to pull down her skirt and bent to look for the book that had rolled away.\u201cOh dear, what shall I do?\u201dAnnette sprang to her feet and scurried towards the book. It was quite humid today, so she was afraid to get the book stained. The book was taken from the study of the Marquis of Carnesis, and if it was damaged, she would not have the face to see Rafael.~WhooshThe playful wind ruffled her braided hair. Before she knew it, almost half of her hair came out of the thin hairpin. The blonde hair fluttered and kept obscuring her view. Because of this, Annette, who bowed her head to pick up the book urgently, did not sense the pillar in front of her in time.\u201cOuch!\u201dSuddenly her eyes flashed, and she felt quite a sharp pain in her left temple. Annette picked up the book with one hand, and touched her forehead with the other. The bump seemed to burn, and a warm liquid trickled down between her fingers.\u201cBlood\u2026isn\u2019t it blood?\u201dAnnette was startled. As a well bred girl, she hardly ever got hurt. It was even more so because she was generally a very cautious person. Annette futilely caressed the place from where the blood was flowing. She was embarrassed and didn\u2019t know what to do.Fortunately, the knowledge she had once seen in a book soon came to her mind. In this case, to stop the bleeding, she had to press on the wound. Annette tried hard to stay calm and pressed down on the wound. However, theories and realities were so different.\u201cOuch!!\u201dWhen she applied pressure on her hand, it was so painful that tears fell from her eyes. Annette finally gave up on stopping the bleeding and removed her hand from her temple, but the blood dripped down and stained the dress. She felt that she might need some help.Annette staggered and turned toward the front door of the mansion. At that moment, a solid wall suddenly appeared before her eyes. She was so surprised that she couldn\u2019t scream and her body stiffened.\u201cAre you hurt?\u201dWhat appeared in front of her was not a wall, but Rafael. He was so tall and well built that Annette\u2019s confused eyes thought it was an illusion. Rafael, looking down at Annette with disapproving eyes, reached out and looked at her forehead.Fortunately, Annette\u2019s wound wasn\u2019t big. The skin where the blood vessels covered was torn, but the bleeding seemed to be severe. For Rafael who had spent the majority of his time on the battlefield, it was just a minor wound.Nevertheless, the pale face of Annette and the crimson blood on her light blond hair looked somehow sinister. Rafael felt like a person who had been pushed back from a cliff. Annette\u2019s pain made his heart sink. Somehow, he felt like he had been through something like this before.Rafael, trying to shake off this nasty feeling, made a bitter rebuke.\u201cWell, are you stupid? Do you think those eyes are for decoration?\u201dAnnette opened her mouth and lowered her gaze weakly. She was speechless, because it was true that she had gone to the pillar and foolishly hit her head. But because of Rafael\u2019s harsh words and her surprise upon seeing the blood, Annette felt extremely upset and tears welled up in her eyes.Annette blinked her eyes and inhaled to avoid crying. Then, unintentionally, a little sniffling sound came out. At that moment, Rafael\u2019s hand, which was grazing Annette\u2019s forehead, hardened. Annette looked up at him, wondering why he was doing this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His face, which was revealed through the flowing black hair, had a cold beauty as if it were not a person. However, his hands that were slightly trembling seemed to reveal his embarrassment that he had hidden behind the mask.At that moment, Annette had a strange feeling. It was a hunch that she herself couldn\u2019t even explain, but if she let out a weak sound now, Rafael would listen to her. Annette carefully opened her lips to confirm her premonition.\u201cI\u2019m sick, Rafael\u2026.\u201dAt that moment, Rafael\u2019s hand, which was pressing on her forehead to stop the bleeding, lost its strength. His enraged face looked down at Annette\u2019s tearing eyes. Rafael tried to spit out his usual snide quibble, but nothing came out this time. A few seconds later, he managed to open his mouth to rebuke her.\u201cOf course it will hurt. The skin on your forehead is torn.\u201dEven though his empty words did not comfort her much, the sharp thorns that were usually present in his cold voice had now softened.With a new courage, Annette carefully reached out and grabbed the hem of his shirt. The shirt curled in the palm of her hand was warm as it radiated the heat of his body.Rafael\u2019s gaze naturally averted to Annette\u2019s hand that held the hem of his shirt. There was still some blood on her hands. Annette, who realized this too late, quickly yanked her hand back. The color of the shirt was dark, so it didn\u2019t show any spots, but she was worried whether Rafael would like getting blood on his clothes. Annette absentmindedly muttered an excuse.\u201cSorry. I\u2019m just a little dizzy\u2026\u201dRafael bent slightly to listen to Annette. Annette thought he was trying to shake off her hand holding the hem of his clothes. But Rafael unexpectedly supported the back of her knee, and lifted her up. And he started taking big strides towards the mansion.Annette was startled by his unexpected kindness. Suddenly, her feet lifted off from the ground, and her vision was a little blurry as the feeling of spinning overcame her. She subconsciously clutched Rafael\u2019s shoulder but thinking of her blood stained hands, she hurriedly removed it. This was the second time that she had stained his clothes.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rafael. I stained blood on your clothes\u2026\u201dThere were so many things she was sorry about today. Rafael did not respond to her apology, and hurried a little further. As he glanced down at her wound, he could see Annette\u2019s blond hair drenched in blood. Instead of worrying about all the blood flowing from her wound, she was worried about his damn shirt getting stained. Rafael was truly dumbfounded.Annette\u2019s body swaying in his arms was unnaturally light. She was very soft, slender, and smelled surprisingly good. She was so needlessly weak that such a minor wound made him feel sorry. Yeah, anybody would have been.Rafael was so unfamiliar with such a fragile appearance. He was worried he might break her, so he focused on reaching the mansion quickly. After flinging the front door open, he quickly strode up to the second floor while holding Annette carefully. Then he slowly laid her down on the sofa in front of Annette\u2019s bedroom.\u201cThank you, Rafael.\u201dAnnette said in a faint voice. Her face had become pale. Rafael turned his back and went away without a word. The icy wind that he caused while hurrying out caressed Annette\u2019s cheek. Annette closed her eyes as she looked at the back that she was so familiar with.After a while, three maids rushed to look at Annette. \u2018They must have been sent by Rafael.\u2019 They wiped the dried blood off her body with a soft cloth soaked in warm water, and bandaged the wound after applying some haemostatic medicine. Then, after drinking enough water, Annette was laid on the bed.\u201cSleep a little, madam. You\u2019ve lost a lot of blood, so you need to rest.\u201dAnnette, who was already exhausted, nodded her head weakly. It was still in the afternoon, so the sun was high up in the sky. But she really didn\u2019t have the energy to open her eyes and so, Annette was sucked into a deep sleep .* * *The moon was especially bright that night. Annette woke up from her sleep and got out of her snow-white bed. Although she was still a little dizzy because of her wound, she was in much better shape than before because she slept so well. She fell asleep in the afternoon, so she thought she had woken up at dawn.\u2018I\u2019m thirsty.\u2019Annette thought blankly. Maybe it was because she lost a lot of blood, Annette, who was generally afraid of the dark and did not go out alone anywhere at night, suddenly had the courage to go out. It was because the bright moonlight today was enough to give her some courage. She carefully stepped out into the hallway with a lighted lamp by her side. She just wanted to drink water quickly and then go back to sleep.~WhooshShe could hear the howling of the winds through the closed window of the hallway. Annette shivered hearing the dreadful noise. The wind has been unusually strong since the morning, and it seemed like it was going to rain tomorrow. Annette\u2019s steps that were going downstairs without much thought, suddenly stopped.\u201cRafael?\u201dShe could hear Rafael\u2019s voice mixed in with the sound of the wind. They used the same floor as a couple, but their rooms were far from each other at the end of the hall.The way to Rafael\u2019s room through the dark corridor was frightening. But Annette decided to show some courage. She was worried about Rafael, and she had even gotten some help from him today. Annette carefully lifted the lamp and took a step forward.\u2018I\u2019m just checking to see if Rafael\u2019s okay.\u2019Rafael loved to drink alcohol. He drank more especially at night. Maybe he was vomiting or suffering from alcohol poisoning. She had heard that some people could choke on their vomit sometimes. What if Rafael did too? Annette was concerned about him.Annette, holding a lamp, carefully stepped towards his room. When she arrived at the door, she could hear the faint sound of metal clashing from inside and someone shouting and sobbing. It was a sound that had never been heard in the bedroom at this late hour. Surprised, Annette hastily knocked on the door.\u201cRafael, are you okay? This is Annette.\u201dThere was no answer from the inside. Annette kept knocking at the door and stamping her feet, but Rafael remained silent. But she could hear him faintly groaning through the thick door, so it was clear that he was inside.\u201cRafael, are you sick? I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m going inside.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This chapter is for you!Annette bravely pushed the door open and stepped inside. Unlike her, who was afraid of the dark, Rafael did not leave the lights on. Fortunately, the moon was very bright today, so the interior of the large bedroom could be seen.Annette looked around and found Rafael\u2019s figure in it. But he was neither on the sofa nor on the bed. This made her wonder if she had heard wrong. If it wasn\u2019t for the strange noise coming from the corner of the wall, Annette might have left the room.~ChiinngA strange scraping sound, like a stone or metal being dragged, entered her ears. Annette whirled to look at the corner, obscured by the shadow of the bed. The eerie metallic sound was coming from the dark corner. Annette\u2019s hand trembled with fear, but she plucked up her courage and walked towards it, the lamp illuminating her way.\u201cRafael?\u201dFortunately, the man standing in the corner was a man she knew very well. Rafael was half-naked without a shirt, as was usually the case at night. Seeing the familiar silhouette, Annette felt glad but hesitated to approach him. Something was wrong.Rafael was currently the most distinguished swordsman in the Deltium Kingdom, and was highly sensitive to his surroundings. But now, he didn\u2019t seem to sense Annette\u2019s presence. There was a longsword in Rafael\u2019s hand, and he was swinging it against the wall. The strange frictional sound that Annette heard was the sound of this blade hitting the wall.Annette, surprised by Rafael\u2019s unusual behaviour, took a breath and stepped back without knowing it. Even though it was quite loud, he still stared at the wall with unfocused eyes. Whenever Rafael\u2019s sword hit the wall, the blade dragged along, producing a creepy noise.\u201cWhat are you doing now, Rafael? Oh my goodness! Are you all right?\u201dAnnette asked while shaking. However, Rafael didn\u2019t seem to understand her. The deep blue eyes, which could be seen through the half-opened eyelids, were unusually cloudy. His face was expressionless, but somehow he still looked enchanting. The moment she saw his peculiar state, Annette recalled a similar condition.\u2018You\u2019re sleepwalking.\u2019Annette felt like someone was suffocating her. She had been married to Rafael for five years in her previous life, but she had no idea he had this condition.It was no wonder that Rafael never fell asleep in the same bed as Annette. After spending the night with her, Rafael would go back to his bedroom as if there was nothing more to do. Rafael\u2019s cold attitude of drawing the line was quite hurtful to Annette.But now that she thought about it, Rafael might not have wanted to be seen in such a condition by her. He was a man of great pride. When she thought about it, Annette grabbed her chest. Unknowingly, a lone tear slid down her cheek.~Chiinng-GrunnngIn the midst of this, Rafael continued to sob and swing his sword against the wall. At first, she didn\u2019t see it because it was dark, but this didn\u2019t seem to have happened only once or twice. The walls that were exposed in the moonlight, were covered with scratches. Rafael\u2019s forehead was already wet with cold sweat.\u2018What do I do?\u2019Annette hesitated, but she couldn\u2019t just leave Rafael in this state. If she turned a blind eye to him, Rafael would repeat this act alone all night long in this large dark room, suffering from endless nightmares. When she thought about it, she couldn\u2019t stop her steps.\u201cRafael\u2026\u201dAnnette cautiously reached out and wrapped her hand around the sword. Then Rafael looked back at her with bleak eyes. The face looked awfully confused, so Annette wasn\u2019t sure if he had come to his senses or not. So, she kept talking to Rafael in the softest voice possible.\u201cStop it and come here, Rafael. Hello? This way. Hold my hand and follow me.\u201dAnnette first led him to a sofa and, fortunately, Rafael followed her. Annette tried to take away the sword from him before he sat down but Rafael held it firmly and refused to loosen his grip on it. Rafael, who was looking at her with quivering eyes, soon opened his mouth.\u201cRobert, how are you here? You, you must be in the front line defense battle\u2026 \u2026 No, no. Are you alive? That\u2019s right, that must be it. I knew it.\u201dRafael\u2019s glazed eyes did not recognize Annette. Annette felt embarrassed by the gibberish words flowing out of his mouth. Now, Rafael\u2019s mind had returned back to the battlefield he had been on several years ago. To that hell where blood, shouts, and death ran rampant.Rafael was originally an illegitimate child of the royal family. The present King Selgratis had quite a few children from outside, and so he was considered nothing special. But Rafael was a born swordsmanship genius. He confidently demonstrated his ability in the war. For this reason, Selgratis recognized Rafael as his own son and gave him a title.Among the old aristocratic families, Rafael was unrivalled. Although he was criticized by the aristocrats who valued pedigree, he always raised his chin proudly and had an arrogant aura. However, behind Rafael\u2019s proud and arrogant mask was a distressed soldier who had not yet completely escaped from the horrors of the battlefield.\u201cWhere are the enemies? They\u2026.. Ah, I hear their shouts. That noise is too loud, Robert, I\u2019m going to kill them all.\u201dRafael\u2019s eyebrows were painfully knitted, and his grip was tightened. Annette nearly cut her arm as he suddenly raised his sword. Fortunately, the sleeves of the fluttering gown saved her. Thankfully there was no blood.\u2018What should I do?\u2019Annette bit down on her lips hard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was now in a dark room alone with a man much larger than herself. He wasn\u2019t in his right mind and was even wielding a sword. She was scared to death by this strange appearance of Rafael.\u201cRafael\u2026\u201dBut Annette didn\u2019t want to leave him all alone here. It was true that she was frightened, but she had now witnessed the weakest moment of Rafael that he had spent so long hiding. Annette somehow felt a strong sense of gratitude towards him. So with great courage, she gently wrapped Rafael\u2019s cheeks with both hands.\u201cShh, Rafael. The war is already over. You are safe now, and nothing will happen to us. So put your sword down and come here. Yeah?\u201dAnnette whispered tenderly and gently patted his cheek. Her small but warm hand caressed Rafael\u2019s face, neck and arms several times. His distressed expression gradually disappeared, and his taut body slowly relaxed.~Clink.. clang\u2026Finally Rafael let go of the sword and it fell on the floor. Fortunately it fell on the carpet, so it didn\u2019t make much noise. Annette gently knocked the hideous thing away from his feet. She sat on the couch and half-hugged the exposed upper body of Rafael.With both her small hands, she gently pressed down on his hard bare chest, so that he could fall down on the sofa. Once he was laid on the sofa, Annette exhaled a huge sigh of relief.But it was still too early to relax her mind. Rafael, reclining on the sofa, looked down at his hands blankly. Then suddenly, he began to rub his hands roughly against his pants. After rubbing so hard against the coarse fabric, the back of his elegant hand quickly turned red. Her sigh of relief soon turned into a long exhale.\u201cLook at this. Blood.. it\u2019s blood, isn\u2019t it? I wasn\u2019t trying to do this, Robert.. You know what I mean? I didn\u2019t want to, but \u2026 I could do nothing about it.\u201dRafael, who was rambling ceaselessly, soon buried his face in both hands as if he was in great pain. The appearance of the veins emerging on the back of the hand as he applied strength to his hands, was horrific. Annette, who saw this, sat by his side, grabbed his formidable veiny hands and gently pressed on it.\u201cI know. Of course, you\u2019re not bad at all, Rafael. So now stop making yourself suffer and rest. Now, would you like to lie down this way?\u2026Yes\u2026 Like that.\u201dRafael seemed to calm down a little, and then followed her hand and lay down with his head on her knees. Because he was so tall, his legs hung off of the sofa a little, but at least he looked much more comfortable than before. All that was left was to let Rafael have a peaceful sleep.Underneath his long lashes, his blue eyes stared blankly into space. His eyes, which seemed to be still wandering at the end of his nightmare, were bloodshot. Annette reached out in sorrow, closed his eyelids, and stroked his shoulders. However, Rafael couldn\u2019t fall asleep and was gasping again and again.\u2018How do I get him to sleep?\u2019Annette thought about what she could do for Rafael. Fortunately, after searching her memories, she was able to think of a lullaby. Her parents didn\u2019t care about her enough to sing a lullaby to their young daughter, so her nanny must have sung it. Annette, who cleared her throat, started singing a little awkwardly.\ud83c\udfb6Good night, darling.When the silver bead-like moon hangs on the black ridgeWhen the soft spring breeze that kissed the flowers blows.When the bubbles pop and rumble and then again grow over the ocean.You will fall asleepYou\u2019ll fall asleep in my arms.\ud83c\udfb6Annette\u2019s low, soothing humming filled the silent room. At the same time, her soft hands gently stroked Rafael\u2019s head as if he was a helpless lovely child.Annette\u2019s lullaby worked better than she thought. Rafael\u2019s rough breathing died down, and the movement of his eyes, which were shaking unsteadily behind his closed eyelids, stopped suddenly. After a while, there was a sound of even breathing. Rafael had finally fallen into a deep sleep.Annette looked down at him, now only humming the melody of the lullaby. Rafael\u2019s face while sleeping so peacefully, looked very exhausted. He must have been suffering from sleep problems for quite some time.Only now did Annette understand why he was drunk every night. Even now, Rafael\u2019s even breath smelled faintly of alcohol.\u2018It was because of insomnia.\u2019Under the strict discipline of the Duke of Bavaria, Annette led a diligent life. She always got up early in the morning and started her day. On the other hand, Rafael would only wake up late and appear past noon with bloodshot eyes. Annette once really disliked this appearance of Rafael.But now that she saw Rafael\u2019s weakness, she felt sorry for him. Annette was well aware of what these symptoms of Rafael were.\u2018This is\u2026.. probably the aftermath of the war, right? The war must have created a trauma for him.\u2019The Kingdom of Deltium was at war a few years ago. This was because the insurgent forces of Letan kingdom, a neighboring country that they occupied more than 100 years ago, rose up. They claimed for the independence of Letan, which had already been merged to the Deltium kingdom, and started a war. They even brought in the foreign powers to raise the stakes. For this reason, Deltium also had to shed quite a bit of blood to suppress it.Rafael fought on the front lines in the war. He built a big army with his overwhelming skills and relentlessness, and got a sweeping victory in return. Even then, he continued to stick to his arrogant attitude of \u201cOf course it was just natural.\u201dIn fact, Rafael was a self-righteous, and proud man. He was as cold and firm as a well-forged-out Mithril*, and nothing seemed to hurt him. So no one, even his wife, Annette, knew the darkness hiding behind his pride.(T/N: It seems author is a Lord of the Ring\u2019s fan.)\u201cYou stubborn idiot.\u201dAnnette touched Rafael\u2019s sculpted cheek and whispered in a small voice. While asleep, his delicate eyebrows and forehead wrinkled in a frown. It seemed as if his beastly sixth sense had noticed Annette looking at him and calling him an idiot.When she saw that, Annette somehow burst out laughing. No matter how angry Rafael was now, it seemed that he would not be as scary as before. She also found out that he was a normal person with his own scars and heartache.\u201cGood night, Rafael. My brave husband.\u201dAnnette whispered in his ear, hoping that Rafael would rest in peace for today. Then the wrinkles on Rafael\u2019s forehead smoothed out and disappeared. Annette, who saw this, laughed silently. So the peaceful night between the couple grew deeper.* * *The sunlight pouring through the window was dazzling. Rafael, who reflexively frowned, felt weird before even getting up. Something was different from usual today.While he was still half asleep, Rafael realised he was in his best condition ever in recent years. He felt as if he had slept well after a very long time. The view of the room when he opened his eyes was similar to the usual, but there was something strange about it. He saw his feet sticking out over the sofa and realized why.\u2018It seems I had fallen asleep on the sofa last night.\u2019It wasn\u2019t so strange that the bed changed. Rafael was well aware of his sleepwalking tendencies. He probably slept on the sofa while moving around in his sleep. Maybe he fell down on such a small sofa and slept more comfortably than ever. \u2018What a funny thing to do.\u2019Anyway, Rafael, who had a good night\u2019s sleep, felt pretty good. It had been such a long time since he was in such good shape like this. He wanted to go out and practice his swordsmanship skills to become a Sword Master. As he tried to get up, he suddenly realized that there was something very soft and warm, underneath him. After confirming the identity of what he was sleeping on, Rafael was confused and could not think about anything properly. He wondered if he was still dreaming.\u201cWhy is she here?\u201dOn the corner of the sofa, he saw Annette sleeping. With a bandage on her injured head, her face seemed unusually small and pale.Rafael gazed at her lowered eyelashes and slightly open, petal-like lips. Admiring her beauty, he inadvertently reached out and touched Annette\u2019s cheek and neck. He said to himself it was to check her body temperature, but truthfully , there was something strange inside him that made him want to touch Annette. The feeling of her skin on his fingertips, was as smooth as silk.Fortunately, even though Annette\u2019s temperature was a little low, it was still in the normal range. The wound had now closed and didn\u2019t seem that sinister. Rafael lifted his hands and clicked his tongue disapprovingly.\u201cIf you\u2019re hurt, you should stay in your room and rest. Why are you..\u201dThe face of Rafael, who had been thinking so far, suddenly hardened. An ominous feeling ran through his head. Rafael unknowingly grabbed Annette\u2019s shoulder and roughly shook her to wake her up. Annette, who was violently dragged out of her dreams, woke up gasping in surprise.\u201cRafael?\u201dRafael glared at her reaction. She looked like a rabbit caught in a trap. He locked her in his arms to prevent her from running away. He then bowed his head to keep his eyes levelled with hers and questioned her in an eerie voice.\u201cDid you see it?\u201d\u201cWhat? What do you\u2026\u201d\u201cLast night, did you see me?\u201dAnnette who had just woken up was a little puzzled at Rafael\u2019s sudden weird mood. But hearing his words, she soon realized what he was asking. His blue eyes, glaring at her, were pretending to be angry, but they quivered a little with anxiety. The proud Rafael must have been worried that she might have seen his sleepwalking episode.How should I answer this? Annette gulped down her saliva.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She lowered her gaze and explained quietly, in case Rafael might find out her lie.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, but I just found the wrong room. I woke up thirsty at night yesterday, but it was too dark to go back to my room after drinking water. So, I came into your room by accident. I was going to go back to my room when it was dawn, but I guess I just fell asleep while sitting on the sofa. Sorry.\u201dFortunately, Annette\u2019s face seemed very sincere, so Rafael was a little dubious. While he was contemplating, Annette slipped under his arm and prepared to escape.\u201cI won\u2019t do that again. I\u2019m sorry. Then I\u2019ll leave you here\u2026.. Yaah!\u201dRafael grasped Annette\u2019s waist from behind and bit her auricle which was revealed through her hair. She seemed to be hiding something, but he couldn\u2019t question her because he didn\u2019t remember last night.Rafael bit Annette\u2019s ears several times with resentment, and then licked up the fleshy nape of her neck. She tasted indescribably sweet. What was started in half annoyance, got his sturdy lower body up early morning.\u2018Should I just do it?\u2019 Rafael thought while looking down at Annette, who was gently embraced in his arms. But the white bandage wrapped around her little head bothered him. Rafael preferred rough sex, but if he rolled Annette now like that, her wound might open and bleed again. Anyway, she was such a weak woman.\u201cGo. If you come into my room one more time, just know it won\u2019t end here.\u201dRafael threatened and pushed her away coldly. The way he turned his back against her, he seemed to be quite angry. Annette nodded and hurried out of the room. Although he didn\u2019t seem to be fooled by her lie, it was fortunate that she could escape the situation.Annette wiped her ear and nape, wet with Rafael\u2019s saliva, with her sleeve. He especially liked to lick and bite Annette. This point had not changed from the past till now. After all, her husband was a beastly man.* * *A few days later, after finishing his afternoon training, Rafael came into the mansion wiping his sweat. His expression was horribly distorted. It was because a few days had passed since he couldn\u2019t sleep properly. Certainly, the lack of sleep for a long time had a profound effect on Rafael\u2019s sword skills.\u2018I was in much better shape when I slept well.\u2019Rafael clicked his tongue, recalling how he slept on Annette\u2019s thigh a few days ago. That day, his body felt so refreshed that he attained outstanding achievements. That day, he felt as if he could reach the state of Sword Master soon. Rafael fell asleep that night, believing he would become the Sword Master the next day .But this all just remained as Rafael\u2019s illusion. He suffered from sleep disorders again, and his performance with the sword also receded. \u2018At this point, I would rather sleep with Annette.\u2019 Rafael\u2019s delicate eyes were filled with irritation.\u2018She would certainly look at me like I\u2019m a funny person!\u2018After all, it was he who had told her not to come into his bedroom, and now it was also him who wanted to desperately sleep with her. It was obvious what Annette, a member of the prideful Bavarian family, would think of him. However, she was his wife anyway, and she had to fulfill her duty to sleep with him. And by now, the wound on her head had healed, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about it opening again.Rafael decided to think as he pleased. Of course, he couldn\u2019t tell if it was a nasty coincidence or Annette\u2019s warmth that helped him have a good sleep. But now, he really wanted to find out. Due to lack of sleep, his blue eyes were bloodshot.Entering the mansion, he looked around with hungry eyes and questioned a maid who was passing by.\u201cWhere\u2019s Anette?\u201dThe maid\u2019s pupils quivered as it was the first time she was talking to Rafael. Even though she had been working several years as a maid in the Carnesis Mansion, it was the first time she had spoken to her young and fierce master. The maid answered quickly, bowing her head too politely.\u201cHer Majesty has gone out today. She has left a note for you, would you like me to bring it?\u201dOut? Rafael\u2019s handsome forehead knitted in frown. He felt a strange feeling of betrayal because he thought Annette had gone to her parents\u2019 home. Rafael still hadn\u2019t forgotten the butler\u2019s insult and the blatant disrespect her family showed by returning the wedding gifts.\u2018In front of me, you pretended to be on my side.\u2019Rafael frowned. He didn\u2019t want to admit it but he was starting to have a little faith in her. It seemed Annette was always on her family\u2019s side, and by now she must be swearing and cursing him there. If she was indeed a crafty Bavarian woman, then that was all there was to it.Rafael clenched his teeth and instructed the maid to bring the note to confirm the truth. Rafael snatched the note from the maid and glanced down on it.\u2013 Dear Rafael.I\u2019m going to the palace today. My new sister-in-law, Claire Lucid Bavaria, from the Chapelle Empire, is staying at the Deltium Palace for the first time. So to say hello to Claire, I will visit the Imperial Embassy east of the palace. I\u2019ll be back in time.Rafael\u2019s expression as he looked at the light pink scented note paper became strange.Well, it seemed Annette didn\u2019t go to that damn Bavarian Duke, so his anger quickly cooled down. However, the reason why Rafael\u2019s expression was so strange wasn\u2019t just because his presumptions about Annette were wrong.Graceful Annette Bavaria, who had been thoroughly brought up as a young lady of a powerful Ducal House, had\u2026\u2026unexpectedly, a very bad handwriting. It seemed that she had tried to write it down while pressing the pen hard on the paper, but it smeared the ink and made the note look even more messy. It was amazing to see that even though she wrote with the finest pen and a high-quality paper, the result could be like this.\u201cThe palace.\u201dRafael, who held the letter paper, was lost in thought for a moment. He thought Annette was probably now sitting with her new sister-in-law, Claire, and drinking tea in a friendly way. He could imagine the appearance of the two women, wearing large puffy dresses decorated with ribbons and feathers while eating pink desserts. Perhaps they would curse and badmouth him to accompany their desserts.Rafael frowned. He hated the arrogant Bavarians. Especially the Duke of Bavaria who didn\u2019t leave a chance to insult him whenever he saw Rafael in the royal palace. And the greatest irony was that, now, he was his father-in-law.The world sometimes seemed more comedic than a comedy.\u2018But Annette Bavaria is, well, not that bad.\u2019Rafael, who inadvertently gave a generous evaluation of Annette, clicked his tongue. Maybe this after all was Annette\u2019s intention. She may be fooling him with her gentle and courteous face and laughing at him for being stupid behind his back.The thought of it made Rafael feel somehow dirty. He couldn\u2019t let her denigrate him before her new sister-in-law who came from the Chapelle Empire. Rafael also felt the need to go to the royal palace. He had so many questions to ask his father, the current king of the Deltium, Selgratis. Especially about Annette Bavaria.Rafael frowned at the thought of his father, who always smiled suspiciously at him. He hated going to the royal palace, but sometimes like a pitiful noble beggar, he had to endure what he hated. He had a hunch that today would be a very unpleasant day.* * *Annette\u2019s tea time was neither pink nor sweet, unlike Rafael\u2019s expectations. Her new sister-in-law\u2019s wrist, tilting the teacup across from her, was quite sturdy. It was clear that the hand was more familiar with wielding a sharp sword than an elegant tea cup. What was seen under the table was not the hem of a rich dress, but a pair of pants of a knight.Annette looked at her new sister-in-law, Claire. With her blue hair cut short below her chin, she was an androgynous beauty. She was also an outstanding knight who headed the 3rd Knights Division of the Chapelle Empire. Feeling Annette\u2019s gaze, she put down her teacup and started apologizing out of the blue.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t attend your wedding, Annette. I was on a really important mission at that time.\u201dClaire\u2019s accent, mixed with the Chapelle people\u2019s accents, sounded more harsh. But under her cold-looking appearance, she was actually a very sweet-tempered person. She still seemed to be remorseful for not being able to attend Annette\u2019s wedding due to unavoidable circumstances.\u201cNo, I understand. The Empire was a mess at that time, right? There was an assassination attempt on the military commander. My God, I\u2019m glad the work went well.\u201dAnnette smiled and accepted Claire\u2019s apology. When her commander is on the verge of being assassinated, how can Claire, a knight, come to her wedding? It wasn\u2019t something she couldn\u2019t understand. Not just Claire, but her brother Arjen must have also been very busy.Blinking at the friendly response of Annette, Claire jumped up from her seat and hugged her. Claire, who looked much more dignified than most nobles, poured a shower of kisses on Annette.\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty! How can one be so nice? If I were a man, I would have married you by all means, Annette Bavaria.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Annette Bavaria Carnesis now. Don\u2019t forget I am married.\u201dAnnette, swinging in Claire\u2019s arm, said with a smile. Then Claire stopped moving and let her go. All of a sudden, Claire\u2019s expression became very serious.\u201cSo are you alright, Annette? You said that your husband is \u2026.. Rafael Carnesis. \u201cThe smile on Annette\u2019s face completely disappeared. She thought that just like other nobles, Claire would also question Rafael\u2019s parentage. It wasn\u2019t so pleasant for Annette to hear about her husband\u2019s illegitimate birth. But what popped out of Claire\u2019s mouth was completely different and something that she never expected.\u201cRafael, the Demon of the Battlefield, right? I heard he\u2019s into men. Rumor has it that he and his aide-de-camp were in a relationship. Is he really gay?\u201d[T/N: In the raws it says \ub0a8\uc0c9\uac00\uc57c (namsaekkaya) Well gay in korean is \uac8c\uc774 (namseongae). Namsaekkaya would literally translate to indigo man, which means sodomite in korean. I\u2019ve just used gay here but the term namsaekkaya appears a lot in next chapter, so I\u2019ll be using sodomite for then.]Annette\u2019s smile stiffened at the unexpected words.\u2018What the hell are you talking about? My husband is gay and is also into sodomy?!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She knew better than anyone that Rafael wasn\u2019t a sodomite. To say he was gay\u2026. it was too ludicrous. Once caught by Rafael, she could only be released after gasping underneath him until she was too exhausted. Annette, who remembered this, quickly denied.\u201cNo, Claire. My husband is\u2026 he likes women.\u201d\u201cAre you sure? How do you know that\u2026 Ah.\u201dClaire, who had been asking thoughtlessly, suddenly fell silent. \u2018How do you know that?\u2019 As Claire herself thought about it, the question was too ridiculous.\u2018Of course they\u2019ve slept together since they are married. I\u2019ve been swinging my sword so much lately that my brain seems to have become rusty.\u2019Claire had no intention of questioning her sister-in-law\u2019s sex life, so she was very embarrassed. Claire swept her short hair in an awkward way. Then suddenly, she came up with another question and asked Annette very carefully.\u201cSo, now he knows? Annette, that you\u2026. That nothing happened between you and the Crown Prince?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dAnnette\u2019s cheeks flushed as she recalled her first time. When she remembered Rafael\u2019s shocked face that night, she laughed a little. Claire breathed a sigh of relief after hearing Annette\u2019s answer.\u201cYeah, of course he should know! Annette, is there any girl who is as diligent and kind as you? If your husband had neglected you because he believed in those vile rumors or whatever, I was going to ask for a duel.\u201dClaire\u2019s eyes were sincere. Annette, in a cold sweat, held her back and dissuaded her from thinking so. Though Rafael had a poor character, he was a brilliant and talented man, enough to win the Marquis title with his sheer swordsmanship skills. Although Annette loved Claire, she was convinced that if the two fought, Rafael would definitely win.Claire, after calming her excitement, lowered her deep blue eyelashes and immediately fell in thought. Her pink lips, with nothing applied, posed a sharp question.\u201cYour coachman who framed you back then, was his name Ivan? Has it been revealed who\u2019s behind it yet?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s probably not that easy.\u201dIvan was a name that made Annette\u2019s heart beat faster every time she heard it. Annette wasn\u2019t able to become the Crown Princess only because of the false accusation of one coachman. Claire, biting her lips, muttered in an angry voice.\u201cHonestly, it was that big jerk\u2019s doing. How dare he put such a terrible charge on you?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dAnnette answered calmly. In her previous life, when she heard this story, she felt so bitter that her heart collapsed and heat surged through her body. But, perhaps because of her regression, she was able to maintain a more objective attitude this time.\u2018Actually, the false accusation of lobbying with the prince\u2019s body now seemed cute.\u2019It was nothing compared to Annette\u2019s \u2018real\u2019 charge. There was a useless custom of having more than one candidate when selecting the Crown Princess. It was literally just a formality.Annette\u2019s contender at that time was Lady Celestine Keers, daughter of Marquis Keers. However, her family was very weak to even compete with Annette and crucially, Ludwig liked her more. It was obvious to anyone that the next queen would be Annette.However, the world was a place where one never knows what to expect.One day, Celestine, who returned from meeting the prince, suddenly went missing, and everything was turned upside down. The contender Celestine was kidnapped by some rascal on her way home.Fortunately, the kidnapped Celestine returned safely in a day. But the real problem was the identity of the person who kidnapped Celestine. As expected, it was Annette\u2019s personal coachman, Ivan.Ivan, who was interrogated, pretended to hold on a little and soon accused Annette being all behind it.\u201cIt\u2019s not fair! I was just following Lady Annette\u2019s orders. How could a coachman like me dare to disobey a noble\u2019s command? I just did what I was told to, so please take my injustice into account!!\u201dIvan\u2019s acting skills were truly outstanding. He cried so desperately that even Annette wondered if she had ever done that. \u2018Was it as persuasive enough for others?\u2019What followed was an obvious downfall. To her surprise, Ivan took the royal servants as his accomplices. Annette was familiar with those servants as she had seen them quite a number of times when she entered and left the royal palace. Together, they all testified against her by saying, \u201cThe Princess of Bavaria did this.\u201dThanks to this, Annette became a terrible evil woman who was blinded by jealousy and tried to kidnap and kill her rival. The Marquis of Keers was very furious and insisted on Annette\u2019s punishment. However, the power of Annette\u2019s father, the Duke of Bavaria, was so great that it was all suppressed down very quietly. The king sided with Bavaria, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s pass this quietly.\u201d\u2018And then he married me off to Rafael.\u2019Annette sighed as she recalled the painful memories for the first time in a long time. Ivan was her personal coachman who had driven a carriage for her for nearly ten years. She wanted to ask him why he did it, but it was impossible at this point. Annette slowly opened her mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s behind it yet. There is no way to even know if Ivan is dead or alive. Someone took him out of the royal prison. Maybe he was already killed in silence.\u201dClaire also guessed Ivan might be dead. Even if he was behind it, he still wouldn\u2019t have been left alive. It was fortunate that the terrible false accusation on Annette was not known by anyone at all. Thanks to the thorough silence, only the involved parties knew about this.Well, in fact, it was also good for Celestine, the victim. As she was kidnapped for not more than a day, it was difficult for this to be known to the outside world. If people came to know Celestine had been kidnapped, how much would they have to say? Some of them sure would have spread malicious rumors about her. Then, even if she became a queen, her future would be a thorny road.\u201cI thought about it, Annette.\u201dClaire suddenly lowered her voice as she lowered the teacup. Her intelligent eyes narrowed in suspicion.\u201cCouldn\u2019t all this be a self-made play done by Celestine Keers?\u201dAnnette almost laughed out loud. She was actually suspicious of Celestine too. Celestine lost nothing in this case. The kidnappers didn\u2019t touch a single hair of her, and the \u2018silence\u2018 was so good that her honor was also not lost. Crucially, she even took the place of the prince\u2019s fiancee, which would not have been possible with her family status.On the other hand, Annette lost everything. Having endured all sorts of rigorous education to become a Queen, she fell into such a pit and was quickly tossed aside. On top of that, some people, including Rafael, believed in those false rumours and harshly criticized her.\u2018It\u2019s so unfair.\u2019Annette made up her mind. Although she couldn\u2019t get rid of the charge in her previous life, this time, she will prove her innocence at any costs. Just then, Claire reached out and hugged to comfort her.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Annette. It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s behind it. I\u2019ll make sure I catch those who have accused you of such kinds of stuff. If they dare to ruin your future, wouldn\u2019t it be fair to break their limbs too?\u201dClaire smiled ferociously, revealing her teeth. But Annette, who had planned to catch the person herself, hugged Claire without a word. Thanks to Claire, who treated Annette like her own sister, she felt relieved. She believed in Annette\u2019s innocence.\u2018I hope that someday, Rafael could also trust me.\u2019Annette thought to herself. In her previous life, she didn\u2019t get along very well with Rafael, so she had no way of knowing his thoughts. The only conversation they had were arguments and fierce criticisms. It wasn\u2019t until Annette was dying because of her illness, that Rafael became kind to her. But by that time, it was already too late.\u2018But still more than Ludwig\u2026. I like Rafael.\u2019Annette\u2019s cheeks flushed a bright red. She herself was surprised at her own thoughts. \u2018I guess Rafael and I have been married for too long. I\u2019ve come to think about things I\u2019ve never had in my previous life.\u2019Prince Ludwig was also a handsome man with a delicate beauty, but Rafael was so sensual and manly that any woman would turn her eyes twice to look at him. Even Annette, who knew his dirty temperament thoroughly well, sometimes became nervous around him and her heart would flutter for no reason whenever she saw him laugh.At first, she thought it would be a marriage in which she would only cry and eat ginger* at the king\u2019s recommendation, but it was not always bad. Anyway, Rafael didn\u2019t abandon Annette even when she was dying of illness. In that respect, Rafael was a very responsible husband. Atleast, he was much better than Ludwig, who turned away from her because he could not go against his father\u2019s order.[T/N: Eat ginger means to face difficulties]\u201cSo how is elder brother Arjen doing these days? Oh, is he still addicted to his work?\u201dAnnette decided to stop thinking about her husband. So, this time, she asked about Claire\u2019s husband. Of course, Claire\u2019s husband was Annette\u2019s elder brother, Arjen Bavaria.Claire\u2019s face frowned when her husband was mentioned. She complained, wriggling her eyebrows that were more handsome than a man.\u201cDon\u2019t say it, Annette. I haven\u2019t been home for three weeks. Apparently, I heard he washes and sleeps in the royal palace\u2019s office. Someone might think he\u2019s a homeless man.\u201dAnnette laughed as she recalled her elder brother, Arjen. He was recognized for his extraordinary brain early and went to study at the Academy of the Chapelle Empire. And after completing all his courses, he was taken to the office as a high-ranking official of the Chapelle Empire. Arjen\u2019s talent seemed to be too exceptional to be limited to the Kingdom of Deltium.Of course, her father, Allamand did not like it very much. As soon as his studies were over, Arjen was supposed to return and receive his education as a successor to the Bavarian family. But Allamand couldn\u2019t do anything about it as the opponent was the Chapelle Empire! Even though Allamanda did not like it, he had no choice but to let Arjen go.\u2018It was probably the first thing that didn\u2019t go according to my father\u2019s will.\u2019Annette was envious of her great elder brother. The Chapelle Empire was much larger than the Kingdom of the Deltium, and Arjen was always busy thanks to it. So he couldn\u2019t come to Annette\u2019s wedding, which was suddenly held.Unlike Claire, the valiant Knight commander, Arjen was a weak and nervous civilian-type of handsome man. Claire and Arjen, who filled each other\u2019s shortcomings, were a very well-matched couple. At least that was what Annette thought.\u2018Can Rafael and I ever be that kind of couple?If it had been her previous life, she would have shook her head and said that it was absolutely impossible. But now, Annette could not be too sure. Rafael had changed as much as she had changed herself. It was truly a wonder.Claire glanced at Annette who was deep in thoughts, and eventually put something out on the table. It was a small box wrapped in a rustling golden wrapping paper. Annette blinked as she saw the item, Claire smiled brightly with an expectant look.\u201cTa-da! It\u2019s a late wedding present, Annette. Although it\u2019s not the marriage you wanted, I still hope you live well and happily. This is my sincere wish for you.\u201dClaire, holding Annette\u2019s hand, smiled affectionately like Annette\u2019s real sister. Claire\u2019s family was actually full of haggard men so she found her new sister-in-law, Annette very cute and pretty. Annette, who smiled happily at her congratulations, picked up the present and asked without thinking.\u201cThank you, Sister Claire. But what\u2019s in here? It\u2019s very light.\u201d\u201cOh, that?\u201dClaire suddenly smiled sordidly. She lowered her voice and whispered secretly as if she was spewing state secrets.\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised. that\u2019s\u2026. It\u2019s a tremendous thing that will make even the gay men horny.\u201d\u2026 It was absolutely impossible not to be surprised after hearing such words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her naive reaction made Claire laugh out loud and ruffle her hair. Claire thought Annette was really very cute. At that moment, Annette unknowingly recoiled and let out a small scream.\u201cAah!\u201d\u201cHuh? Did it hurt? I\u2019m sorry, Annette.\u201dA surprised Claire hurriedly lifted her hand and examined Annette\u2019s head. Her sharp eyes soon found a small scar on Annette\u2019s forehead. And at that moment, Claire\u2019s face became cold.\u201cWho did this, Annette?\u201dClaire\u2019s playful expression became grave in an instant. Even though she was asking who did it, she was quite certain of the culprit. In the first place, only a few people could hurt Annette and that could only be the enemies of the Duke of Bavaria. Annette, who noticed Claire\u2019s misunderstanding, quickly denied it.\u201cNo, Claire. It\u2019s not like that. I just\u2026 bumped into a pillar by mistake.\u201dAnnette found this a little strange. Obviously, she was just telling the truth, but strangely it sounded like a typical excuse from a beaten wife. Naturally, Claire\u2019s green eyes reflected her skepticism\u201cWhat do you mean no? This damn sodomite Rafael dares to touch my sister..!\u201dClaire, who was thoroughly angry, jumped up from her seat with such force that it overturned the table. Because of this, Claire\u2019s gift fell to the floor.Annette was moved by Claire\u2019s words, \u201cMy sister.\u201d But now was not the time to be moved. She quickly calmed Claire down before she accused Rafael of being a man who beated his wife.\u201cReally, it wasn\u2019t Rafael! I hit my forehead against the edge of a pillar while trying to pick up a book. Here, look closely at my wound here, you can see that it\u2019s not a wound that one would get when hit, but it\u2019s actually torn skin. Isn\u2019t it?\u201dAnnette swept her blond hair aside so that Claire could see it in more detail. In fact, compared to the extent of bleeding, the wound was not very big, and it healed after a few days. Annette was amazed at Claire\u2019s sharp senses. It was hard for her to see the wound because it was covered by her hair, but Claire quickly found it out. It was simply amazing.Claire opened her eyes and scrutinized Annette\u2019s wound. Claire, who had been training as a Knight since she was a child, was familiar with injuries. Just as Annette said, the wound did resemble one that one would get on bumping into something.\u201cOkay. But I\u2019ll be watching from now on, Annette. If he ever raises his hand on you, you can tell me anytime. I\u2019ll make sure to crush him.\u201d\u2018How the hell are you going to crush him?\u2019 Annette laughed at Claire\u2019s bloodthirsty threat and her eyelashes fluttered lightly. Although Claire couldn\u2019t beat Rafael, it was reassuring to know that someone was on her side. This was why her brother, Arjen, was in love with Claire.Annette was always used to the cold, menacing presence of the Bavarian family. She was so used to it that she did not even know that she craved for some familial love. Her brother, Arjen was kind but he was always busy because his brain was so extraordinary. The lone genius had no time to pay attention to his sister, who was five or six years younger than him.Annette wanted to be loved by her family, so she became a good child. She was especially under the illusion that if she met her father, Allamand\u2019s expectations, he might love her. \u2018How naive you were in the past!\u2019\u2018Although everything was already wrong at that point, I was completely abandoned when I couldn\u2019t be the Crown Princess.\u2019Now the only people who she could call her family were Arjen, CIaire, and Rafael. Of course, Rafael hated her, but maybe they could find a compromise. Annette wanted to get along with him if possible. He was a better husband than she thought, contrary to his intimidating appearance.\u201cOh!\u201dJust in time, Claire bent over and picked up the gift that had fallen on the floor. It had fallen earlier when Claire excitedly got up from her seat. She laughed, giving Annette the gift back as if embarrassed by her impulsive behaviour.\u201cOh, I\u2019m glad Rafael Carnesis isn\u2019t a son of a bitch who hits his wife. It\u2019s a hard-earned gift. I got it so I could get along with my husband. I still want to take it back now.\u201d\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s really in here?\u201d\u201cAre you curious? If you\u2019re curious, go home and open it with Rafael Carnesis.\u201dClaire, with a mischievous smile, casually shrugged her shoulders and teased Annette. She did not tell her what was the present until they parted. Thanks to this, Annette had to walk with a vague expression, fiddling with the gift.\u201cWhat the hell is in this box?\u2019\u2018It must be something terrible to even arouse the sodomite men.. No way, it\u2019s not an aphrodisiac, is it? That\u2019s something illegal.\u2019 Annette looked down at the box with a stiff face as if she was looking at a bomb. Of course, that wouldn\u2019t make her see the object in the box.Annette decided to go home quickly and check out this suspicious gift. The place where she met Claire was west of the palace. Because of this, it took her quite a long walk to get to the south gate where her carriage was waiting. Naturally, Annette\u2019s footsteps became a little hurried.It was then, a long shadow suddenly fell in front of Annette. Annette\u2019s eyes widened, when she casually looked up and identified the owner of the shadow.\u201c\u2026. Greetings to the Little Sun of Deltium.\u201d\u201cAnnette.\u201dThe person in front of her was none other than Prince Ludwig. A man who she once believed she would marry. Also the man whom she after being framed, never met again.Annette was embarrassed to see him in front of her after a long time. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t be considered a long time if she considered her present life. But it was a reunion after nearly five years if her time before regression was also counted. In front of Ludwig, Annette , who was always polite, trembled secretly. The timing of the encounter was not so good.\u2018There might be illegal aphrodisiacs in the gift box.\u2019She couldn\u2019t believe she had to worry about this in front of the prince, who she had reunited with for the first time in five years. Annette became sad. The face of Prince Ludwig, looking down at her, looked very lonely. After a few seconds of silence, he reached out to his former fiancee.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to kneel before me, Annette. Get up.\u201dFortunately, Ludwig did not seem to be interested in the box that Annette was holding. His blue eyes were fixed as if they were nailed on Annette only. His eyes even looked pained.Annette didn\u2019t take his hand and she stood up on her own. Now that she was married to another man, this was right. When Ludwig noticed Annette\u2019s indirect rejection, he withdrew his hand and frowned.And in an earnest tone, he asked Annette.\u201cIf it\u2019s fine, l\u2019ll like to walk with you for a while. I have something I want to tell you.\u201dAt the unexpected suggestion, Annette closed her eyes and remained silent. Frankly speaking, she didn\u2019t want to do it. Taking a walk with Ludwig will do her more harm than good now. If anyone saw them like this, Annette would again be gossiped about how she still hadn\u2019t given up on the throne. If anything like that went into Rafael\u2019s ears\u2026.. just thinking about it was terrible.Seeing Annette\u2019s hesitation, Ludwig reached out to her. His graceful fingertips were shaking a little. Ludwig, carefully grasped the end of her sleeve, decorated with lace and whispered painfully.\u201cPlease, Annette\u2026.please.\u201dHis face, which was just as beautiful as before, was pale with anxiety and nervousness. Seeing this, Annette let out a sigh. It wasn\u2019t like Ludwig did not know why or what he was doing this now. Annette looked around and eventually accepted.\u201cInstead, please bring at least four attendants with you. I have to go home before it\u2019s too late, so I can only talk for 30 minutes. Is that okay with you?\u201d\u201cOf course, Annette.\u201dOnly then did a smile bloom on Ludwig\u2019s sad face. He quickly noticed why Annette was doing this. Ludwig beckoned towards four servants who were standing far away from them. Seeing the four servants following them, Annette felt relieved. At least, this was much better than walking alone with Ludwig.Fortunately, Ludwig led her to the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace. No one could enter this place without Ludwig\u2019s permission. Naturally, the chances of their walk becoming a social gossip were also lowered. It really was an excellent location.Sitting on a bench, Ludwig remained silent for a while. He seemed to be agonizing over what to say. Annette looked at Ludwig\u2019s side and waited patiently. He looked a little thin and more nervous than she remembered. Annette\u2019s eyes were full with pity seeing him like that.\u2018You poor fellow.\u2019Ludwig was a seemingly perfect man. He was tall and had a slender physique. His flawless skin, and his features were as delicate and beautiful as a woman. In particular, the long silver hair that cascaded down to his waist shimmered like moonlight and made Ludwig\u2019s appearance stand out more. He was a man who would be soon crowned as the king.However, Ludwig had one fatal drawback.\u201cAnnette\u2026.Oh!\u201dLudwig, who was about to get up from his seat as if he had made up his mind, stumbled. He almost tripped over on his own feet. Annette caught his arm swinging in the air with familiarity and made him sit back. Ludwig liked to have his butt attached to one place.* To his life. To the future of the Deltium.[T/N: To have one\u2019s butt attach to one place means to remain still. What she means here is that he always remains still(or doesn\u2019t do anything) when it comes to his life or the kingdom]\u201cAre you all right, Your Highness?\u201d\u201cOh, thank you, Annette. What an embarrassment.\u201dShe helped him up. Ludwig who had a perfect appearance and seemed to be good at everything, was actually a far cry from it. He was terribly clumsy. Everything he did with his limbs turned out terribly. He would never dream of doing intense activities like sword practicing and horseback riding. Even on a flat floor, he fell alone on his knees and ate dust.Ludwig, who had just now stumbled and got help from Annette, blushed. He took a deep breath and then turned his head to look at Annette. Annette looked at him blinking her eyes, wanting him to get up and say something.The moment their eyes met, a painful expression came on Ludwig\u2019s beautiful face. His crimson lips whispered painfully,\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Annette.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For Ludwig it was something that happened only a few weeks ago, but for Annette, who had returned, it was something that happened five years ago. Perhaps that\u2019s why Annette was able to look at him with an objective attitude as if it were someone else\u2019s business.\u201cI, Annette\u2026.So, I\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t send \u2026 your wedding present.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Your Highness.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just an empty talk, it was really all right. Rather, if Ludwig, as her ex-fianc\u00e9, had sent her a wedding gift, it would have been disastrous. By the way, even in this situation, the only thing he could say to her was \u2018I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t send you a wedding present.\u2019 Unlike before, Annette felt that Ludwig\u2019s weakness was pathetic.When Ludwig noticed the blatant criticism in her pink eyes, he bit his lips. With a character as delicate as his face, he hesitated for a while, unable to say something. Ludwig buried his face in both hands and confessed as if he was vomiting everything in his heart.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not actually sorry. I didn\u2019t want to send a congratulatory gift to your wedding. So I didn\u2019t send one on purpose. In this case, I know I should say sorry, but to be honest with you, I\u2019m really not. I\u2019ve been looking forward to see you. I.. I\u2019ve always been sorry for that, Annette.\u201dLudwig muttered without any remorse and buried his face even deeper into his hands. At this point, it was confusing whether he was really sorry or not. Now all that could be seen of Ludwig was his pinna that peeked out through his long silver hair. His ears were turning red and he whispered bitterly.\u201cWhat on earth should I do? To me, my only princess is you Annette.\u201d\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201dAnnette, hearing Ludwig\u2019s confession, casted her eyes down in silence. She felt something hot coming up from inside her throat. Of course, it wasn\u2019t because she was moved by Ludwig\u2019s words. Annette was actually trying to contain her anger.\u2018You didn\u2019t do anything when I was framed.\u2019Thanks to this, Annette was expelled from the nomination of the Crown Princess, and Celestine became his new fiancee. Of course, in the process, Ludwig was restless and even appealed that it was Annette whom he loved. But that was just all of Ludwig\u2019s \u201ceffort.\u201dLudwig was always weak against King Selgratis. Ludwig, under the pressure of his father, finally stepped back and just watched her from a distance until she got married to Rafael. But now, he pretended to be remorseful and said, \u2018My only princess is you.\u2019Annette was dumbfounded. If it hadn\u2019t been five years ago, by now she would have been blinded by anger and grabbed Ludwig by his collar. Of course, if she had done that, she would be taken to the palace dungeon No. 503 for the crime of touching the body of the royal family.Annette swallowed up her pent-up anger and reeled it in well. With a nonchalant smile, she poked Ludwig\u2019s sore spot.\u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t say that. Now you have Lady Celestine Keers, don\u2019t you? She\u2019d be so sad to hear that. She likes you very much.\u201dShe did like Ludwig, to the point she dragged Annette through mud just to become a Crown Princess. Well, still it was just a family affair. Anyway, Annette\u2019s prickly and amiable tone made Ludwig\u2019s ears turn red. He couldn\u2019t raise his head and buried his face between his palms. Painful sobs escaped out of his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026I\u2019m really sorry. Annette. But I can\u2019t really love Lady Keers.\u201d\u201cBut she\u2019s your fiancee now. Please try to get along with her well.\u201d\u201cBut Lady Keers is\u2026. she\u2019s so different from you. She\u2019s too nervous and sensitive. I can\u2019t even imagine a future with Lady Keers. Just being together with her makes me tired.\u201dAfter hearing Ludwig\u2019s words, Annette was puzzled. Did Celestine Keers have such a sensitive personality? When they often met as crown princess candidates, she seemed relatively indifferent. She was quite fond of Ludwig, so there\u2019s no way she\u2019d be nervous around him.But again,she didn\u2019t know her very well. If Celestine was the one who drove out Annette and took the crown by making her own play, it would not be strange if her true character came out slowly after becoming the winner. Well, if she could plot to blame Annette like that, she could be quite a vicious woman.Whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t the time to rush anything. Seeing Annette remain silent, Ludwig\u2019s head sank down more and more. Now the words coming out of his mouth resembled a gasp.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Annette. Because I\u2019m this kind of man,\u2026I\u2019m just sorry for you.\u201dWith his face hidden in his hand, the only thing she could hear from his serene figure was sounds of his breathing. His breathing began to get harder and faster. Ludwig seemed to be sobbing and gasping. He was too weak to deal with stress and fell into a mild panic.Fortunately, Annette was used to his seizures. When Ludwig had a seizure, it was nothing more than pouring oil into the fire if the person next to him was embarrassed. So Annette replied gently in a low humming tone.\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s all right. It\u2019s now all in the past. I have never resented you. Both me and Your Highness have done what we could, so there is only one thing left to do and that is to accept it and be okay with it. So please don\u2019t bother about it.\u201dAt first glance, Annette\u2019s answer sounded monotonous. But, this was one of the ways to alleviate Ludwig\u2019s nervous seizures. Fortunately, Ludwig\u2019s breathing subsided a little when he heard Annette speak. Annette, after confirming that it was effective, skillfully changed the subject.\u201cShall we think about something else? Well, there are vast stretches of wheat fields in the Chapelle Empire with no end in sight. Even if it\u2019s windy in summer, it is said that the field looks like it\u2019s covered with green waves everywhere. The wheat grains rub against each other, and a fresh smell of grass emanates from them. Someday I would like to lie there and take a nap while listening to the songs of the larks. Perhaps their cheerful song is as beautiful as Your Highness\u2019 lute?\u201dAnnette\u2019s voice was sweet and calm. It was a quiet tone that was very pleasant to hear. The sounds of Ludwig\u2019s harsh breathing subsided as he listened to her words.Annette waited patiently for him to calm down. Although Ludwig was the only Crown Prince of Deltium, his disposition was frankly more of an artist than a ruler. Since birth, his path had already been decided, and it was quite painful because it didn\u2019t suit his aptitude. This was the main cause that induced Ludwig\u2019s occasional seizures.\u2018Well, he\u2019s a poor man.\u2019Ludwig especially liked to play the lute. He could play very beautifully, but unfortunately, he didn\u2019t play it that often. This was because his father, King Selgratis, disapproved of Ludwig\u2019s hobby.King Selgratis hoped that Ludwig, his one and only legitimate son, would have more desire for power\u2026. like Rafael. King Selgratis was a harsh father who pushed Ludwig to his limits for this point. He sometimes did not hesitate to even compare Ludwig to Rafael. Thanks to this, Ludwig was very nervous about Rafael.Knowing this well, Annette looked at Ludwig with a slightly wistful look. Just in time, Ludwig holding his face, opened his lips with slightly reddish eyes.\u201cApart from you, who else would understand me, Annette? Now that I must marry another woman, other than you\u2026 I do not want to. I don\u2019t think I can bear it.\u201dLudwig\u2019s eyes looked over Annette\u2019s head as he nervously spoke. The tall man could easily look down at Annette\u2019s little head.\u201cI always thought that the crown of the Crown Princess would suit your blond hair. There is a very beautiful red ruby embedded in the crown. The crown would have shined more brightly on your blond hair and the red ruby would have made your pink eyes stand out even more. So\u2026 I had been looking forward to the day when I could myself put the crown on your head.\u201dLudwig, who finished speaking, smiled wistfully. His fingertips hovered in the air as if he wanted to touch Annette\u2019s blonde hair. But he couldn\u2019t touch her. Now, Annette was the wife of another man, who happened to be his half brother, Rafael.Annette looked at such Ludwig without saying a word. As it wasn\u2019t a bad break-up, Annette also felt sorry for him. Ludwig was safe because he was a Crown Prince, but also at the same time he was unhappy because of it. He was rather a man who would have been much happier if he was born as a fourth or fifth prince. Then he could have lived a leisurely life away from the troubles of the throne.\u201cAnnette.\u201dAt that moment, Ludwig, who rose from his seat, knelt before her. Then he bowed his head and kissed Annette\u2019s skirt affectionately. His silvery eyelashes were dripping wet.\u201cSorry. Even though I believed in your innocence, I couldn\u2019t go against the strong will of my father. I know I was cowardly. But I also\u2026. I can\u2019t live without you. Only you Annette Bavaria, it should only be you.\u201dLudwig whispered as he looked up at Annette imploringly. Annette was surprised by his unexpected words and jumped up from her seat without her knowledge.In the first place, there was only one reason she accepted Ludwig\u2019s request to talk. It was to say goodbye to him for the last time. However, the situation kept becoming worse.\u201cYour Highness, please don\u2019t do this. I am already married to Rafael\u2026\u201dAnnette, who was trying to speak in a hurry, suddenly froze stiff in place. Her eyes fell on the gift box next to Ludwig. The light box seemed to have fallen when Annette got up in surprise.It was okay until the box fell a little on the floor. Claire also dropped it once. However, the box that fell to the ground twice in a row, as if to protest, opened and threw out its contents.And the true identity of the horrible gift that could make even the sodomite men go into heat\u2026 was a leather choker and a whip.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He inadvertently opened his mouth after looking at the box.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the box you were holding? Looks like its lid is broken, but don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll order the attendants to\u2026.\u201dLudwig couldn\u2019t finish the sentence and his face hardened. It was because he realized quite late what the contents that came out of the box were. There was a sudden silence in the Palace that was earlier full of heartfelt atmosphere. It was a very, very heavy silence.Annette closed her eyes silently. At this point, she thought it would have been better if it was an illegal aphrodisiac. If that was the case, she could have at least made some excuse saying it was a perfume or a lotion. But at this moment, she didn\u2019t know how to explain the choker and whip.Amidst this silence, one of the attendants standing behind Ludwig, carefully approached them. With great professionalism, he picked up the box from the floor, gathered its contents and silently put it back in the box. Then, after placing it on the bench, he stepped back as if nothing had happened and returned to his original position.Meanwhile, Annette closed her eyes and prayed that the world would somehow perish at that moment. Of course, the world did not perish, and the time for explanation came. Before she knew it, Ludwig stood up from his seat and looked at Annette with quivering eyes. He stutteringly asked, not even knowing what he was asking.\u201cYour\u2026 no way, Rafael does that sort of thing to you\u2026. ?\u201d\u201cNo, no. Absolutely not!!\u201dA frightened Annette spoke with an unusually strong, shrill voice. Feeling a sense of crisis stronger than ever, she spit out whatever that came into her mind. It was the first time in Annette\u2019s prudent life that her words were ahead of her thoughts.\u201cWell, that\u2019s because we have a dog in our house! It\u2019s really almost the size of a house, and I\u2019m sure Your Highness probably hasn\u2019t seen such a big sized dog. I wanted to educate myself about how to tame such a fierce dog, so I placed a special order\u2026 Because it\u2019s a really big dog.\u201dSomehow, the more she spoke, the more uncomfortable she felt. It was obviously an excuse that she made up, but strangely enough, she felt as if she was indirectly cursing Rafael. Feeling guilty, Annette closed her eyes tightly. At the end of her long, lengthy excuse, Ludwig accepted it with a trembling look, as if he had been pushed by some momentum.\u201cWell, I see.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dAnnette replied absentmindedly. She hoped the world would perish now, but unfortunately, Annette did not have the ability to make things happen as she wanted. In fact, she wondered whether she had any special abilities.Another awkward silence passed between Annette and Ludwig. Ludwig, who was standing in an awkward position, soon offered her a seat.\u201cLet\u2019s sit down for now\u2026 Let\u2019s sit down and talk.\u201dHe tripped over his words. Annette sat on the bench silently, just wanting to die. She just wanted to pick up the box and run away, but leaving without permission in front of the royalty was an insult and a punishable crime.Fortunately, Ludwig seemed to want to change the subject too. He was desperately worried about something, and soon opened his mouth.\u201cI was composing a new lute song the other day, do you remember? I just finished that song a few days ago. Would you like to listen to it?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness.\u201dNow whatever it was, it was fine. If only she could escape from this awkward atmosphere, Annette nodded soullessly.When Ludwig beckoned, one of the servants behind him ran and brought a lute. Ludwig, in his position, tried to calm his mind and began to play the lute. Even in this situation, Ludwig\u2019s lute performance was remarkably excellent.Annette closed her eyes and listened to the lute and tried to calm herself down.From Ludwig\u2019s delicate fingertips, a beautiful melody like a celestial song filled the air. Ludwig, who finished playing, opened his mouth with a more relaxed expression than before.\u201cThis reminds me of old times. When I played the lute, you would sit by my side and listen like this. Do you remember?\u201d\u201cOf course I remember it.\u201dMusic certainly had the effect of softening the mood. Thanks to that, Annette also felt a little nostalgic. As she reminisced her memories, Annette\u2019s beautiful face, with her eyelashes down, looked deep in thoughts. Ludwig looked at her with admiration and suddenly opened his mouth.\u201cAnnette, I have a request for you. Will you please listen to my request?\u201dAnnette, who looked up at Ludwig, did not readily accept his request. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me, he would again say something controversial like you are my one and only queen\u2019. Annette was a little nervous about what would come out of his mouth, but fortunately Ludwig wasn\u2019t greedy.\u201cIf it\u2019s okay, please sing along to my performance just like old times.\u201dUnder Ludwig\u2019s long silver eyelashes, blue eyes resembling that of Rafael\u2019s gleamed brightly. Annette, who was worried about his unexpected request, agreed, since it wasn\u2019t a difficult request.Ludwig was very afraid of his father. And King Selgratis didn\u2019t like the sight of Ludwig playing musical instruments. For this reason, Ludwig used to use Annette to play his favorite lute. They closed the doors and windows tightly under the pretext of chatting, so that Ludwig could play the lute, without his father knowingThe rumors that Annette threw herself at Ludwig to become the Crown Princess must have started because of this. Well, it would be obviously misunderstood if a grown man and woman were doing something alone in a closed room. They probably would think they had that kind of relationship.Annette clicked her tongue with disapproval at her foolish past self. So she added one condition to Ludwig\u2019s request.\u201cOf course. Since it is only one song anyway, let\u2019s just play it here. But after that, I really have to go. It\u2019s already very late.\u201d\u201cI understand. Thank you for listening and agreeing to my request, Annette.\u201dBefore he started playing, Ludwig looked at Annette with sorrowful eyes. When this performance would be over, she would go back home. To her husband and the house where Rafael is. And after that he and Annette would become strangers forever.Ludwig bit his lips. He had firmly believed that he would be Annette\u2019s husband, and he still wanted to be. Not Rafael, but him. He should have been Annette\u2019s husband. But it seemed that Annette had already acknowledged and accepted Rafael as her husband. So Ludwig felt indescribably bitter.\u2018Not only the father\u2019s affection but also Annette\u2026 he took away everything.\u2019A dark shadow passed over Ludwig\u2019s blue eyes. But now was the time to focus on Annette. Ludwig composed himself and soon began to play the lute. Just like the memory of those days, when he believed that he would put the crown of the Crown Princess on her blond hair himself.Annette gently closed her eyes and hummed to the tune. It was a song that she had already sung several times in the past. At first, her humming, which was nothing but a melody, soon turned out into a song.\ud83c\udfb6The tip of your sword is the color of the cold winter.The roars of the boiling battlefields are the color of the lava.Loyalty to the royal family is the color of the first leaves of evergreen trees.When the world goes round and round and all these colors melt together,I\u2019ll stamp my feet once and leave freely.\ud83c\udfb6Annette liked to sing. Of course, she didn\u2019t have much skill because it was just a hobby, but the voice itself was soft and gentle. So it was worth listening to.Whenever she went in and out of the royal palace, she often joined Ludwig like she did today. Although her singing ability was not as good as before, it was still fun to sing like this after a long time. So Annette didn\u2019t realize that the lute had stopped playing at some point.I will leave freely..After finishing the last verse of the song, Annette opened her eyes and she was startled. This was because Ludwig, who was playing the lute a while ago, was lying on the bench with his eyes closed.\u2018Wait, did you really faint? Was my singing so terrible?\u2019Frightened, Annette hurriedly got up from her seat and shook Ludwig\u2019s body. She thought Ludwig, who often had seizures, collapsed again. Or he might have hit his head with his hand while playing the lute. That was possible because Ludwig was terribly clumsy.\u201cYour Highness, Your Highness! Get a hold of yourself. Are you sick?\u201d\u201cUm, Annette?\u201dFortunately, Ludwig quickly opened his eyes. She didn\u2019t know if he fainted or fell asleep for a while, but at least it didn\u2019t seem there was anything wrong with his body. Ludwig\u2019s eyes blinked for a couple of times and he yawned drowsily.\u201cWell, I guess I was so tired that I fell asleep for a while. I\u2019m sorry, Annette. Why am I suddenly so sleepy?\u2026 That\u2019s really weird. I guess I\u2019m not feeling well. I\u2019m ashamed that I fell asleep after holding you back to talk to you. Go back home and please be careful on your way.\u201dLudwig said goodbye to Annette, speaking gibberish with his eyes half closed. His delicate eyelids had several wrinkles, although he was in a deep slumber. Annette was bewildered by the unexpected situation, but she had hoped for it anyway, so she quickly said goodbye to Ludwig.\u2018That\u2019s weird.\u2019Annette tilted her head as she looked at the back of Ludwig disappearing in the distance. Ludwig was very sensitive, so he did not sleep much. But still, he fell asleep while playing the lute, which he loved so much. It was not something that Ludwig would do.But there was something more surprising. Annette turned back without thinking and found the four attendants waiting a little further away. It was a burden for her to walk alone with Ludwig, so she had requested for the attendants to accompany them.Apparently just a moment ago, they were standing upright, but now they all fell asleep while leaning on each other. Just like how Ludwig did.\u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019Annette stood still in place, with her mouth hanging open in surprise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They always held themselves upright and were careful with everything they did. Not only one, but all four of them fell asleep during work. It was something beyond conceivable.Feeling strange, Annette tested by shaking one of them awake. Then, just like Ludwig, the first attendant got up bewilderedly in a fit of surprise. He couldn\u2019t believe he dozed off while serving a distinguished guest who visited the Crown Prince\u2019s palace! There was nothing to say about this even if he was hit for lack of discipline.\u201cNo, what kind of disrespect! I\u2019m really sorry, Marchioness of Carnesis. I sincerely apologize for my misconduct.\u201dThe attendant apologized politely to Annette, while covertly kicking his colleagues hard to awaken them. Shortly after, the other servants got up and then bowed their heads to apologize. Seeing them sway in the waves of drowsiness, Annette waved her hand and pardoned them, saying it was okay.The attendants who knew nothing, looked at Annette with twinkling eyes. Annette, who didn\u2019t get angry at them, smiled kindly and showed them mercy, was literally like an angel to them. It was a great pity that such a kind woman could not be the Crown Princess.But Annette\u2019s thoughts were a little different. As soon as she turned around, the smile disappeared from her face and was replaced by a grave expression. At this moment, there was only one thought in Annette\u2019s mind.\u2018In the book, it was clearly written that the regressors have one special ability that they did not possess before. Maybe my ability\u2026 Is putting people to sleep by singing. \u2018A strange thrill passed down Annette\u2019s body, as she realised this. She had once put Rafael, who was suffering from insomnia and sleepwalking, to sleep.At that time, she thought that it was the effect of a good lullaby. But now that she looked back, she wondered if it was true that she used the \u2018ability\u2018 to put Rafael to sleep. She wasn\u2019t sure of anything yet. Annette, who was cautious in everything, decided to try this theory if it was possible.Although it was not a marvelous ability like spirit skill, it might be more useful in some cases.Annette, who had thought so far, felt goosebumps erupt on her skin. This was because she finally felt more than ever before, that she had really returned back to the past. She was really living a new life. And her future was entirely in her hands.* * *The day passed away quickly and the sun had already set. Before she knew it, it was already dark. The carriage going back home through the dark was slower than usual. However, Annette, who was deep in her thoughts didn\u2019t even realise this. She was contemplating how to test her new abilities. So, she didn\u2019t even realise that they had arrived home.\u201cWe\u2019re here, madam.\u201dThe coachman carefully announced their arrival to Annette. Annette stepped out of the carriage completely lost in her thoughts. But before her feet could touch the ground, suddenly her body was swept up into the air.\u201cAhh!\u201dThe unpleasant feeling of floating terribly surprised Annette. It was especially surprising because it happened while she was in the midst of her thoughts. Annette instinctively pulled whatever she could reach out to and clung on it. It unfortunately turned out to be Rafael\u2019s pitch-black hair.It was Rafael who caught Annette from the carriage. He looked very displeased when Annette grasped his hair. Annette became still as a silent growl slipped out from his slightly parted lips.\u201cOh my, I\u2019m sorry. I was so surprised that I\u2026\u201dAnnette quickly let go of Rafael\u2019s hair and apologised tremblingly. She was gasping for breath as she could not calm down her surprised heart. Looking down at such Annette, Rafael, who was about to hurl out some abuses, took a deep breath while clenching his teeth. He looked very fierce as if he was bearing something.\u2018Why are you so angry?\u2019Annette, who saw this, was overwhelmed with anxiety. Rafael\u2019s anger had nothing to do with her pulling his hair. He had been waiting for Annette in anger for some reason. The cold air of the night that had seeped into Rafael\u2019s collar proved this.Annette bit her lip because she didn\u2019t know why he was doing this. The whimsical and violent temperament of Rafael was a very difficult mystery for Annette. With a hardened face, Rafael questioned her.\u201cWho did you meet at the palace today?\u201d\u201cWhat? I went to see my sister-in-law, didn\u2019t you see the letter I left?\u201dAnnette, who responded in a daze, realized something was wrong and lamented at her stupidity. She didn\u2019t know how, but Rafael seemed to know that she met Prince Ludwig today. Only then did Annette understand why Rafael was so angry.In fact, it was natural for Rafael to be angry at her. His wife pretended to meet someone else, and had a secret meeting with her old fiance. Looking at Annette\u2019s embarrassed expression, Rafael felt even more cold and empty.\u201cYou said you\u2019d be back in time. You must have had so much fun that you didn\u2019t even realise so much time had passed, did you? Did he treat you so well?\u201dRafael\u2019s deep blue eyes looked colder than the ice in the North Sea. Even after returning, it was still painful to receive his hatred. Annette, with her eyes lowered pitifully, carefully reached out and grabbed Rafael\u2019s collar.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Rafael. I just bumped into him on my way back from seeing my sister-in-law. The marriage was so suddenly broken off that we couldn\u2019t even say goodbye to each other properly. That\u2019s why I just wanted to finish that relationship well. Now we will never have to face Your Highness again. I promise.\u201dAnnette raised her head and looked up at him with earnest eyes. Rafael looked back at her with a blank face without saying anything. Annette\u2019s face looked so naive and gentle that anyone would fall for her lies.However, Rafael was not fooled. He was in a very bad mood now. After reading Annette\u2019s letter, he headed to the palace. Of course, he didn\u2019t go to pick up Annette. He also had a business to visit the palace for.Rafael intended to meet his father, King Selgratis, and ask him about Annette. It was because the rumors that the king told him before the wedding were somewhat different from the reality. Rafael felt that he needed to check where the hell this discrepancy had originated.However, Selgratis did not meet Rafael. He acted as if he cared about Rafael in public, but in private, he avoided any exchange with him. It was all truly a pretense.Because of this, Rafael had to return from the royal palace. Naturally, he felt terrible, and decided to go back home with Annette. However, it was an apparent mistake in Rafael\u2019s judgment.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing in the Palace of the Crown Prince?\u201dWhen Rafael found out where Annette was, he was very angry. He wanted to see with his own eyes what the two lovers were doing, but the place was the crown prince\u2019s palace. No one could enter the Crown Prince\u2019s palace without Ludwig\u2019s permission. It was also the same for Rafael.As he turned his back and came out of the palace, he felt more terrible than before. After returning to the mansion, Rafael gnashed his teeth and waited for Annette to return. Originally it didn\u2019t matter to him where she was or what she did, but Rafael didn\u2019t realize that his behavior was strange. As he looked at Annette trapped in his arms, he felt an anger that he could not understand.\u201cRafael, I\u2019m telling you. Nothing happened with His Highness. All we did was say goodbye. You can ask the servants of the Crown Prince\u2019s palace. You\u2019ll find out the truth.\u201dAnnette, with her eyes lowered, pleaded innocently. However, it seemed that today, luck was not on Annette\u2019s side. The coachman who was checking the carriage in the distance, came to her with something in his hand.\u201cMadam, this is what you left here.\u201dWhen Annette saw the gift box that the coachman had brought out, she gave up everything. A vain laugh escaped out from her mouth. God must have decided to abandon her today.Rafael put her down on the floor, picked up the box and looked inside. He laughed sardonically after checking the contents of the box. The leather choker, held between his fingers, fluttered in the air. Rafael held it in front of Annette and spat out coldly.\u201cYes, you\u2019ll get a very interesting answer if you ask the palace servants.\u201d\u201cNo, Rafael! That\u2019s Claire\u2026Wait a minute.\u201dEmbarrassed by the growing misunderstanding, Annette hurriedly reached out and took away the gift box. She searched inside with unusually urgent hands. Claire was the type who usually enclosed letters in gifts. Annette hoped that there would be a letter inside so that she could clear all the misunderstandings.Fortunately, an envelope attached to the inside of the box came into her hands. Annette quickly gave it to Rafael without even checking the contents of the letter.\u201cLook, this is a gift from my new sister-in-law. I really have nothing to do with the Crown Prince!\u201dRafael frowned as he pulled out the letter and read it. His deep blue eyes slowly skimmed the contents of the letter. It only took a few seconds, but for Annette it felt like an eternity.Rafael with a sarcastic smile, brought the letter in front of her. There, in Claire\u2019s unique sharp font, a concise sentence stood out. Annette didn\u2019t know whether that was a good or a bad thing.I hope you have an exciting night with him, Annette! Make him call out your name by putting on that tight leash!Yours lovingly,Claire\u2018Ah, Claire\u2026\u2018 Annette covered her face with both hands without saying anything. She was frustrated. Her letter made it clear that it was a gift from Claire. But it wasn\u2019t clear who Claire\u2019s \u2018him\u2018 in her letter referred to, whether it was Rafael or Ludwig.The stark comments that Claire wrote and the leather choker in Rafael\u2019s manly hands, together made Annette even more embarrassed. She couldn\u2019t raise her head and prayed desperately to disappear from this world forever.But this time again, Annette\u2019s wish did not come true. \u201cOkay. What an exhilarating farewell you had at the Crown Prince\u2019s Palace. Let\u2019s see how thrilling it was for you.\u201dRafael smiled cruelly, revealing his teeth and grabbed her arm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Annette pulled her arms and tried to cover her exposed chest. At that moment, something soft and prickly struck her ass.\u201cAhh!\u201dAnnette was startled and her body shuddered. The whip was made by trimming the softest leather several times, so it didn\u2019t hurt much. But she couldn\u2019t help but be startled whenever it struck her skin. Annette looked at Rafael with pitiful eyes, but he ignored her and ordered in a cold tone.\u201cDon\u2019t cover it. Put your hands away.\u201dAnnette\u2019s pink eyes trembled when she heard those words. Rafael, seeing her pitiful eyes, raised Annette\u2019s chin with the tip of the whip.\u201cYou still want to pretend to be innocent?\u201dHis big, sharp eyes reminded her of a beautiful beast. Annette lowered her arms helplessly, feeling like a captured rabbit. Then Rafael slowly walked around her, looking at her naked body with fierce eyes. As his eyes fiercely raked her naked body up and down, Annette felt as if a fire was licking her exposed skin.Rafael, who was inspecting Annette\u2019s luscious body, stretched his arms from behind and wrapped it around her waist. She could feel his big hand touching her chest. His hand was so big that they easily covered all her ribs. Rafael, with his head dipped, bit her auricle from behind and whispered softly.\u201cTell me. Have you ever allowed the Crown Prince to suck these pretty breasts?\u201d\u201cWhat? What the hell are you\u2026 Aahh!\u201dWhen Annette was about to refute, she yelped in surprise. His warm hands roughly grabbed both of her breasts. The sensation she felt as his hands rubbed her nipples was strange. She felt a thrilling stimulation at the tip of her nipples that were pinched.\u201cOh, Rafael \u2026\u201dSuddenly, one of his hands plunged into Annette\u2019s underwear. His hand, like a snake, squeezed in between her legs and rubbed her core. Annette instinctively crossed her legs, but couldn\u2019t escape from his tenacious touch.Rafael\u2019s hand slowly ran over from the back of her perineum to her vagina and then in front of the clitoris, which had started to swell. Before long, his red lips rose in a cold sneer.\u201cYou\u2019re already wet.\u201dAnnette sobbed with shame. Seeing her like this, an excited Rafael pulled her lower body closer and began to rub her core hard. Every time his hand touched her garden, Annette felt the strength between her legs becoming loose, as if her legs would melt. Annette gasped and twisted back and forth, but couldn\u2019t get out of his grasp.Suddenly, she felt something hard touching her hips. Rafael, who had his lower body pressed to hers, began to rub his angry arousal against her. Annette bit her lips helplessly, not knowing what to do with the intense stimuli from her back and front, but the area between her legs became more and more wet.\u201cOh, Rafael, uh-huh.\u201dEvery time he moved his finger, she could hear wet sounds. As his hard fingers that had developed calluses during his swordsmanship practice, rubbed her clitoris, she felt an exhilarating sensation.He spread her petals and rubbed her little hole, making Annette instinctively tighten her insides. The body that had gotten acquainted with the pleasure offered by the man, was restless and felt strangely empty.Annette was now tottering and could barely stand properly. She leaned on his hand to support herself. But his tenacious hands rubbed her core more and more quickly. The slippery love liquid coming out from between her legs, spurred the lewd movement even more. When he started rubbing her clitoris hard, Annette finally couldn\u2019t stand it any more and reached her peak.\u201cHa-huh\u2026\u201dAnnette\u2019s legs, which could barely support her, became completely soft. Rafael, who was standing behind her, embraced the slender woman as she slowly fell into his arms.At that moment, something wrapped around Annette\u2019s slender neck with a clack sound. Annette quickly reached out her fingers to the thing wrapped around her neck. It had a small cold metallic and soft leather feel. \u2018This must be the choker that Claire gave me as a gift.\u2019The moment she realized this, Annette\u2019s cheeks flushed as if they were on fire. Unknowingly, she cried and asked Rafael for help.\u201cRa, Rafael\u2026 Untie this for me.\u201dRafael slowly glanced at her without saying anything. His eyes full of vivid desires looked at her white skin, her shiny shriveled nipples, and the black choker wrapped around her slender neck. It was an insanely stimulating scene.Rafael gritted his teeth and pushed Annette against the wall. He made her stick her hips out with her arms against the wall. Annette had no idea what to do, so she posed as she was told to and looked back at him with anxious eyes.\u201cRafael? Yikes!\u201dThe whip snapped again on her backside. It wasn\u2019t painful, but Annette\u2019s body shuddered unknowingly with shame. This kind of thing was done as a corporal punishment only for small children. It was very embarrassing that she, a fully grown, mature woman was beaten with a whip on her exposed cheeks while being completely naked.Annette looked at Rafael with a desperate look. She understood why he was angry, but she really hoped that he would stop this shameful corporal punishment. But the moment Rafael saw Annette\u2019s big watery eyes, he reached out and grabbed her hips hard.\u201cFuck, don\u2019t look at me with those eyes, Annette. You tend to provoke men too much.\u201dRafael was annoyed and spouted out harsh words. Then, as if to punish her, he spread her ass, and pushed his arousal from behind. Her secret place which was already wet welcomed him without any hesitation. His swollen tip rubbed her wet insides and reached her deepest parts.Rafael was so excited that he immediately began to shake his waist. His heated manhood pierced through her vagina and rubbed her sensitive inner walls. Annette accepted the rough attack, while panting and leaning against the wall. Every time he pushed her roughly from behind, the heels of her feet kept lifting off because of the difference in their heights.\u201cHuh, Rafael, ah, huh!\u201dThe movements were so intense that she felt as if her body was going to break. Still, it felt really good. She liked it so much that her legs kept getting loose. Whenever that happened, Annette, who felt anxious at the feeling of floating, unknowingly tightened her insides. Rafael, who was driving Annette from behind, groaned.\u201cStop tightening, Annette. Do you like to get punished that much?\u201dRafael, who rebuked her, spanked her ass with his palm. It had been a long time since he threw away the whip. At first, he just did that to make Annette feel ashamed, but the smoothness of her derriere that he felt in his palm was amazing. He deliberately spanked her a few more times, while controlling his strength so that Annette wouldn\u2019t get hurt.\u201cYou\u2019re biting onto me very tightly every time you get hit. Do you like it that much?\u201dAnnette\u2019s ears turned red with shame when she heard his sarcasm. Every time he spanked her backside, she could feel his arousal tightening as he forced his way inside. Whenever that happened, she could feel the movement of his penis piercing her insides more clearly. Her legs trembled as he poked her weak spots with force.\u201cHuh, ah, Rafael, ah\u2026\u2026!!\u201dShe couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. The beastly mating from the back raised Annette\u2019s shame and desire. She shivered gently and tilted her head. Her inner walls were spasming violently due to the orgasm, but his manhood kept on pushing through the gap without any hesitation and continued to feed her desire. In the midst of the climax, she was so overwhelmed by the rough movements that tears flowed down from her eyes.\u201cRafael, that\u2019s enough!\u2026Ah! Hhhh, ahh! Stop it, okay?\u201d\u201cStop it? You\u2019re saying this while biting me down there? And it doesn\u2019t seem as if you\u2019re not having fun, Annette.\u201dRafael, with his hand outstretched forward, rubbed her clitoris vigorously. Every time he brushed his fingers along her clit, a faint wet sound was heard between her legs. Annette bit her lips, feeling the love juices flowing down between her legs. She couldn\u2019t bear it. She was ashamed of her own lewdness, but her body which had known the joy of carnal pleasures, was more heated and wanted to use him as a material of pleasure.Rafael\u2019s fingers were wet and he began to fiddle with her slippery clitoris. He was still thrusting his length wildly from behind. Every time he shook his waist, his penis rubbed back and forth her vagina, and her inner walls seemed to melt in pleasure.His big and hard penis was never satisfied as he drove Annette endlessly until she was exhausted.\u201cDo you feel it, Annette? Your little hole is chewing my cock so hard.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know if Rafael was right. Annette couldn\u2019t even groan properly anymore and just cried and cried because of the intense pleasure. His hand pinching her clitoris and his violent thrusts that rubbed and pierced through the walls of her vagina all brought a terrible pleasure. The slippery walls, which were tenaciously stabbed in the sensitive area, convulsed joyfully and tightened around him.Annette eventually reached another climax and collapsed due to exhaustion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He couldn\u2019t drink today unlike usual. It had become a habit before going to bed, but today he found that he was strangely reluctant. He thought it would be better to drink it slowly than chug it down like usual.The sparkling golden liquor slowly flowed from the glass to his red lips. As he was savoring the taste and aroma of the liquor in his mouth, Rafael\u2019s gaze soon turned to his side. There, an exhausted Annette had fallen into a deep sleep.Annette\u2019s pale eyelids were closed without making any movement. She was sleeping with her mouth slightly open and shallow breaths were coming out of it. The inside of her mouth was a very pale pink. Just by looking at this innocent appearance, no one would ever think she had just had a damn hot sex.Annette was clinging to his side just like a puppy looking for its mother. Her little hands on his body were so light that he could barely even feel their weight. Strangely, a tickling feeling seemed to be transmitted from her white hand to his body. Rafael shoved her hand away heartlessly.\u2018Strange woman.\u2019Still, her face was stunningly pretty. He could finally understand why the Bavarians took so much pride in themselves, as if they were a special race. Even though the damn Duke of Bavaria was an elegant middle-aged man with platinum-coloured hair, he still looked amazing. He could prove the fact that they were the wealthiest lineage with his face alone.Rafael reached out for no reason and touched Annette\u2019s cheeks. On the soft, round cheeks, a faint redness from their recent affair remained. As he looked at those reddened eyes, he felt all his blood flow down to his nether regions. But if he did give in to his desire, Annette would really become sick.\u2018Anyway, she\u2019s uselessly weak.\u2019Rafael clicked his tongue. He didn\u2019t expect to have such a relationship with this woman. Rafael\u2019s hostility towards the Duke of Bavaria was that great.Rafael really hated the Duke Allamand Bavaria. He had opposed Rafael\u2019s Marquis title until the last minute. Rafael still remembered the eyes of Allamand Bavaria, as he looked down at him with contempt. He considered himself superior and hated to even breathe the same air as an illegitimate child like Rafael.So Rafael had accepted this wedding. Even if Annette was a vicious woman and her relationship with the Crown Prince was broken, he didn\u2019t care much about it.All Rafael needed was Annette\u2019s lineage to compensate for his muddled blood. On top of that, it was not only fun to see the distorted expression of Duke Allamand Bavaria who became his father-in-law, but was also quite profitable to be able to see his work. Annette was only valuable to him in that aspect.\u2018How many couples in the world love each other and get married?\u2019Rafael didn\u2019t even believe in love. The only thing in this damn world he could believe in, was himself. He wanted to make his way up to the nobles, who laughed at him, and he needed Annette for that. Other than that, it didn\u2019t matter to him what Annette did behind his back.\u2018She\u2019s from the noble Bavarian family anyway, so she\u2019ll soon be fed up with her disgusting lowly husband.\u2019 Rafael thought.However, Annette turned out to be slightly different from his expectations. She acted as if she respected Rafael, and every time they quarreled, she tried to explain herself with sincerity. He couldn\u2019t grasp yet whether she was pretending or being actually serious.\u2018Well, it doesn\u2019t matter anyway.\u2019There was nothing wrong with Annette pretending to respect him. Rather, it was advantageous for both of them. Rafael languidly swallowed down the hard liquor in his mouth. The leather choker still wrapped around her elegant neck caught his eyes. He left it on her because he was grumpy. But it wasn\u2019t bad because Annette seemed to somehow belong to him.Rafael snickered, while recalling Annette\u2019s white naked body. At least she didn\u2019t seem to have given herself up to Ludwig. Still, he felt strangely upset, when he imagined them affectionately crying and saying goodbye to each other.He couldn\u2019t bear the sight of Annette with another man. When he thought it didn\u2019t matter what she did behind his back, he could not help but be angry and change his thoughts.Still, it didn\u2019t matter. Because he was an unsophisticated villain who crawled up from the bottom anyway, and Annette was a poor prisoner under his grasp.\u201cUm.\u201dPerhaps she felt a sense of crisis, Annette whimpered in pain. Looking at the woman, who was sleeping like a log, Rafael slowly brushed her luscious bottom lip with indifferent eyes. The flesh, which was slightly pushed under his fingertips, was very soft.Annette mumbled something in her sleep and puckered her lips, making it look like she was kissing the tip of his finger. She looked quite cute. Seeing this, Rafael smiled and whispered in her ear.\u201cIt would be better for you to forget everything about the Crown Prince, Annette. There\u2019s nowhere for you to run now anyway.\u201dRafael whispered in a low, harsh voice and bit her ears. The small white ears with his teeth marks were nice to see. Just like the choker wrapped around her slender neck.* * *Annette woke up and was devastated when she saw the afternoon sun coming through the window. She always used to wake up early in the morning because of the strict education she received from her family. But she overslept yesterday because of the intense love affair she had with Rafael.Annette sighed and as she tried to get out of the bed, she suddenly found the choker on her neck. Annette blushed remembering what had happened last night.\u2018Anyway, he\u2019s so mean.\u2019Fortunately, there was a knife for opening letters on the table. Annette used the knife to cut off the choker around her neck. She was sorry to do that since it was a gift from her new sister-in-law, Claire. But she knew Claire would be satisfied knowing her gift fulfilled her purpose very well.Annette sighed as she recalled yesterday\u2019s Rafael. Although his anger seemed to have been a little subdued through their affair, he seemed quite displeased hearing about her meeting with Ludwig.\u2018It would be better to make him feel better.\u2019Annette felt sorry for him and made up her mind. No matter how little Rafael loved her, it would still be unpleasant to see his wife have a private conversation with her ex-fiance. After getting dressed, Annette went downstairs to find Rafael. On the way, she ran into a maid and asked her thoughtlessly.\u201cDo you happen to know where he is?\u201d\u201cSir has gone out, Madam. He said he was going to the royal palace.\u201dThe maid answered, bowing her head politely. Annette nodded and passed her with a nonchalant face. It was a bit disappointing that Rafael went out without leaving a note, but anyway, he never went around revealing his destination. He was angry with Annette, so he probably must have gone out to vent that anger.Annette sighed and decided to go to the study. She luckily hoped that she could find more books on regressors. But Annette\u2019s plan was unintentionally halted. It was because she found an unexpected person coming out of the reception room.\u2018Gerard?\u2019The tall, elegant-looking young man with blond hair, was Gerard, the butler of the Bavarian family. Last time, he was severely rebuked when he came to return the wedding presents from Rafael. Annette thought he would never visit the Mansion of Carnesis again.Gerard, who had not yet noticed Annette\u2019s presence, headed for the front door with an indifferent face. Just as he was about to leave, he told the servant who came out to see him off,\u201cThen, I will visit again when Your Excellency, Marquis of Carnesis is present.\u201dAnnette\u2019s eyes narrowed hearing his words. Although Rafael was absent, the hostess herself was definitely there. However, Gerard dared to return, saying, \u2018I will visit again when Your Excellency is present.\u2019 Annette found Gerard\u2019s actions very suspicious.\u2018You\u2019re not trying to insult Rafael again, are you?\u2019 Annette was on the edge, feeling an ominous premonition. If that was the case, she couldn\u2019t let Gerard go back like this. If Gerard revisited when she was not in the mansion and provoked Rafael\u2019s anger again, then the worst would happen.So, just before Gerard could leave the mansion, Annette quickly called him. Her voice sounded very pretentious even to her own ears.\u201cGerard! What are you doing here?It\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d\u201cGreetings to the Marchioness. Have you been well?\u201dGerard seemed to have made up his mind. He bowed politely to Annette as if he had just met her. Looking at Gerard\u2019s businesslike attitude, who could guess that he had served Annette for nearly a decade?Annette nodded gracefully. Just like he knew her, Annette also knew him quite well. Annette could see a little bit of dismay on Gerard\u2019s smooth face when she encountered him. Pretending not to have seen this, she calmly said to Gerard.\u201cI was too heartless the other day, wasn\u2019t I, Gerard? But I won\u2019t apologize. As a wife, I can\u2019t stand anyone insulting my husband. But still I\u2019d like to invite you for a cup of tea for old times sake. Let\u2019s talk about the old times. Now, follow me.\u201dAnnette turned around naturally. Then, Gerard\u2019s mouth became a little stiff. He was eager to somehow avoid being alone with Annette.\u201cI wish I could, but I must obey the Duke\u2019s orders. I think I should go now. I\u2019m sorry, Madam.\u201dSure enough, he rejected Annette\u2019s request. At that, Annette\u2019s eyes widened and she covered her mouth in amazement. She looked at Gerard with a hurt face.\u201cOh, my God! Did my father order you not to even have a cup of tea with me? No matter how busy you are, how can he not even allow me to say hello to the old butler? I can\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019ll write a letter to my father right now\u2026\u201dGerard was very embarrassed when he saw Annette protesting directly against her father. It was already a disaster for Gerard to face Annette instead of Rafael in the first place. If Annette\u2019s letter of protest was also added to this, it would be impossible to deal with the mess. Allamand who was already once disappointed with Gerard, would not forgive him twice. Gerard finally accepted Annette\u2019s request helplessly.\u201cA cup of tea will do. Thank you for your kindness.\u201dAnnette took the lead and headed to the parlor with a victorious smile. Now, through Gerard, it was time to dig deeper into her father\u2019s intentions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As the butler of the Bavarian family, Gerard was definitely not an easy opponent. He dodged Annette\u2019s questions and explained only those things that were not very important. Meanwhile, Gerard\u2019s teacup was almost now empty.\u2018What should I do? \u2018Annette frowned, feeling embarrassed. Gerard did not fall for her conciliatory gestures or persuasion. He must have intended to reveal whatever gunpowder he brought only in front of Rafael.She could not force Gerard, who had come under his father\u2019s orders, to open his mouth. Annette, who now did not belong to the Bavarian family, had no authority to persecute Gerard for giving priority to his orders. She secretly grabbed the hem of her dress in anxiety.However Gerard didn\u2019t wait for her to come up with a good idea. Finally, after taking the last sip of the tea, Gerard looked at her with a relieved face. The butler\u2019s face, with his blond hair neatly combed back, was as shrewd as she was.Confident of his victory, Gerard opened his mouth and politely said goodbye. \u201cThen I\u2019m done with the tea, so I should leave now. Thank you for your kindness, Marchioness of Carnesis.\u201dAnnette bit her lips as she watched Gerard get up from his seat. At that moment, an idea flashed through Annette\u2019s mind. She opened her mouth with a calm expression.\u201cGerard, I have a favor to ask you before you go.\u201dGerard became suddenly alert. Annette, who couldn\u2019t give up until the end, said this to check whether she could still try to get something out of him. She quickly continued talking before he could refuse.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing big, it\u2019s just a personal request. I\u2019m learning vocal music as a hobby these days. But I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m talented. I can\u2019t let others hear it because I\u2019m very shy. But since you\u2019ve been taking care of me for a long time, I think it would be fine if it was you who heard it. Oh, can you listen to my song? It won\u2019t take long.\u201dAnnette shamelessly used Prince Ludwig\u2019s request on Gerard. At the unexpected request, Gerard hesitated and couldn\u2019t refuse immediately. Although he was following the orders of his master, the Duke of Bavaria, he liked Annette personally. Gerard, who was worried for a moment, nodded in the end.\u201c\u2026.. I think it will be okay for a while.\u201dAnnette smiled gladly at his consent. The smile that made her eyes close, was so similar to that of her maiden days, that Gerard looked at her with an indulging look without realizing it. Noticing this, Annette closed her eyes and immediately started singing.\ud83c\udfb6The petals of the flower that fall in fleeting sheets of time.If the tragedy of this fall could capture your beautiful eyes for a moment,All right, I\u2019ll be glad to fall in front of you, for countless times. \ud83c\udfb6Annette sang an opera that she had recently heard at the court. The song wasn\u2019t really important anyway. Annette, who was singing as far as she could remember, quietly opened her eyes and looked at Gerard. Sure enough, in less than 30 seconds, Gerard fell asleep on the sofa. After seeing this, Annette blinked and admired her ability.\u2018I guess this is really my ability.\u2019However, it was not the time to leisurely admire her abilility. Annette didn\u2019t know how long her ability could keep a person asleep. So, before Gerard woke up, she had to quickly search his body. She might be able to find some clue if she was lucky.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gerard.\u201dWith a small whisper, Annette reached out and began to search his body. There was nothing in the pocket of the jacket that Gerard was wearing, but fortunately she found something in the pocket inside the vest. It was some letter.Annette carefully opened the letter. Although the sender\u2019s name was not specified, Annette could quickly recognize her father\u2019s exquisite and elegant handwriting. There was a short sentence written in it.~Gifts are for the recipient, not for the giver.\u2018What does this mean?\u2019 Annette pondered over the contents of the single-line letter and fell in deep thought. Allamand, who valued bloodline, was more aristocratic than anyone else. Therefore, he thought it was vulgar to express what he wanted directly. Fortunately, Annette had been his daughter for a long time, so she knew the thought process of her father very well.\u2018I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t like the wedding gift that Rafael sent you.\u2019So he would definitely send the gifts back to clearly express this. Considering the contents of the letter, it seemed that her father wanted a separate \u201cgift\u201d from Rafael.Annette then realized why her father kept sending Gerard to contact Rafael. At first, she thought since Rafael was an illegitimate child, he was trying to humiliate him because he hated to accept him as his son-in-law. However, if that was her father\u2019s real purpose, returning the presents last time served the purpose very well. So it could only mean that her father wanted something from Rafael.\u2018But what the hell is that?\u2019Annette frowned. The Duke of Bavaria was Deltium\u2019s most prestigious and wealthiest man. The Bavarian family was a family that didn\u2019t lack power, wealth, or honor.Rafael, on the other hand, was an emerging aristocrat who had just started his family. Although he had several properties and territories that were awarded to him for his brilliant achievements, they were still not at the level that her father would want to covet. Annette pondered over what her father could possibly want and searched her memories of her previous life.\u201cUm\u2026\u201d\u2018Oh, look at my mind.At this time, Gerard, who was asleep, frowned his delicate eyebrows and showed signs of getting up. It had only been five minutes since he fell asleep, but Annette\u2019s power seemed to be unable to keep people asleep for a long time.Before Gerard fully awoke, Annette hurried to put the letter back into his vest pocket . Annette calmed herself down and lightly shook Gerard\u2019s shoulder to wake him up.\u201cGerard, Gerard? Wake up. Didn\u2019t you say you had to go urgently?\u201dWhen Gerard heard Annette\u2019s voice, he opened his eyes with a disheveled look. The soft eyelids were folded in several layers, and his dark green eyes drooped under the golden eyelashes. Gerard, who blinked a couple of times, looked at Annette and smiled drowsily.\u201cMiss Annette.\u201dGerard, with his eyes slightly lowered, carefully grasped Annette\u2019s hand, which was shaking his shoulders and left a feathery kiss on the back of her hand. It was as if he didn\u2019t know what to do because his girl was so precious.Annette smiled bitterly when she saw Gerard addressing her as a maiden again. He still seemed to be half asleep. Annette, pretending to be unaware of his mistakes, removed her hands from Gerard and clapped loudly to bring him to his senses.\u201cOh my God, Gerard. Was my song so boring? You fell asleep before even listening to the end. I\u2019m a little hurt.\u201dAnnette grumbled, pouting her lips. Only then did Gerard\u2019s eyes become clear and he remembered the situation before he went to sleep. He was very embarrassed and it was quite evident from the look on his face. Gerard himself couldn\u2019t believe that he was so negligent that he fell asleep in this situation.\u201cSorry, Miss\u2026. No, Marchioness of Carnesis. That was very rude of me.\u201dGerard quickly offered an apology. In response, Annette replied in a lonely voice, making a sad expression.\u201cNo. How can I blame others when it is me who doesn\u2019t have any talent? Thank you for accepting my request even though you were busy. Go back now, you\u2019ll be late.\u201d\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll get going now.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t make any excuse because he was feeling very drowsy. Gerard felt like he was possessed by a ghost.\u2018I\u2019m not that tired, but why did I fall asleep?\u2019Gerard, who had no idea what to do,hesitated. He eventually lowered his head and left the Mansion of Carnesis.* * *That night, Annette eagerly waited for Rafael to return. She went through each and every memory of her previous life, but the relationship between her father and Rafael was very bad. So she didn\u2019t even remember Rafael giving anything to her family.All she could do now was to ask Rafael directly. He probably knew what her father wanted. Annette held her hands together anxiously and waited for Rafael to return. She was sorry and upset that her own family kept trying to take something from him.\u2018Did you marry me off to Rafael\u2026 because you wanted something? Was it because of this?\u2019Annette decided to look into this possibility as well. At first, she thought it was a marriage that was settled because of the false charges against her. So she believed that her father had no choice but to give his consent to this marriage.Anyway Annette, who couldn\u2019t become the Crown Princess, was of no value to him. If he refused the king\u2019s proposal, bad rumors about Annette would have spread and created a great negative impact on the reputation of both Annette and the Duke of Bavaria. It was so bad that her family couldn\u2019t even help her.\u2018What if my father had his own plans with this marriage? What if he intended to take something from Rafael by using me, who was already useless to him, as a bargaining chip?\u2019Annette closed her eyes, recalling the cold face of her father who attended her wedding. Her head was spinning with all these new conjectures.\u2018How long have I been waiting?\u2019A little after midnight, at last she heard the sound of Rafael coming in. Annette quickly went down the stairs and welcomed him.\u201cRafael, are you here? How was your meeting at the palace?\u201dInstead of answering her, Rafael looked at her with hazy eyes. She smelled a very strong smell of alcohol from his breath. Annette, who made eye contact with him, was nervous without realizing it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ll hold your hand.\u201dAnnette was anxious but didn\u2019t show it and carefully held Rafael\u2019s big hand. At first, he shook it off, but soon he held her hand together as he was dizzy. Annette supported him and led him to his bedroom.A staggering Rafael flopped down on the edge of the bed. His sword fell down along with him. He couldn\u2019t even support himself as he was very drunk. It was impossible to ask him about anything today.Annette took off his clothes and socks, and gently laid him on the bed. Unlike usual, Rafael accepted her help without saying anything. His eyelids were half-closed, and his face was somewhat flushed because of the alcohol. Nevertheless, he was so handsome that his drunken appearance looked rather decadent and erotic.\u201cGo to sleep early tonight, Rafael. I\u2019ll tell the chef to prepare some hangover soup for you tomorrow.\u201dAnnette whispered, while sweeping away his black hair that had flopped down over his straight forehead. She didn\u2019t know why, but Rafael looked very tired now. He looked like a person who was struggling to suppress something inside of him.Annette looked down at him with sad eyes. At that moment, Rafael suddenly grabbed her hand, which was caressing his forehead, and pulled her towards him. Annette fell on his body and wasn\u2019t even able to scream.Rafael\u2019s handsome face was just right in front of her. Blinking his eyes that looked as blue as the Northern sea, Rafael muttered,\u201cI\u2026. I hate you.\u201dThe moment she heard it, Annette felt her heart sink. Even though she knew this very well, she was still badly hurt when she heard it herself. Annette actually thought she was getting along with Rafael this time. However, it seemed to be her own delusion.Annette bit her lip and pulled her hand from his grasp. Then she tried to get away from his hard body. But Rafael stretched out his hand and pressed her back down, making her come even more closer to his body. Now Annette was half hugging him. Rafael raised his other hand and stroked Annette\u2019s cheek.\u201cYou\u2019ll hate me anyway.\u201dAnnette couldn\u2019t understand what was going on in Rafael\u2019s mind. It was meaningless to be angry at a drunk person anyway. So Annette lowered her eyes and whispered in a small voice.\u201cNo, Rafael.\u201dThere were times in her previous life when she hated Rafael. He was like a fretful man who couldn\u2019t control himself. Annette, who was already mentally and physically unstable due to the shock of her father\u2019s abandonment, could not bear it.Her marriage to Rafael and the sudden change in reality that was caused due to the false accusation were too much for her. She ended up suffering from mental stress and died young. Even though her previous marriage was terrible, there was only one reason why Annette had been able to endure Rafael\u2019s quarrels for so long.\u2018Because the only person who stayed beside me until the end was Rafael.\u2019When Annette was in good health, Rafael was the worst husband to her, but ironically he became a good husband when she fell ill. He nursed her faithfully for about two years when she was bedridden.Of course, Rafael\u2019s temper didn\u2019t change, so sometimes he threw the soup away and yelled at her. But in the end, he would always crawl next to her with a regretful face, check her temperature, and help her get dressed. When she thought of that time, Annette did not hate Rafael as much as before. Even though she married him again this time without a choice, still\u2026 She wanted to dream of a happy future\u2026 if possible with him.\u201cI don\u2019t hate you. Rafael, you\u2019re my family.\u201dAnnette, with a bitter smile, reached out and stroked his cheek. Then Rafael\u2019s sleek eyebrows furrowed and he pushed her hand away. He coldly rejected her touch.\u201cNo, I am not your family. It\u2019s the great Bavaria. Isn\u2019t it?\u201dRafael\u2019s words became more harsh. Even his drunken stupor could not stop his sharp tongue.\u201cRafael!\u201dWhen Annette heard that, she wanted to cry. She had a lot to say, but she couldn\u2019t get her words out of her mouth. She had never felt this miserable.Her father had abandoned her, and her only brother was in a distant empire across the sea. Now that her new sister-in-law, Claire, had also returned to her empire, the only family left of Annette was Rafael. But even he hated her.Seeing this, Rafael reached out and covered her eyes. And he muttered in a low voice,\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, damn it. Every time you look at me like that, I..\u201dInstead of finishing his words, Rafael stubbornly pursed his lips. He didn\u2019t even want to look at her eyes. Seeing this, Annette\u2019s eyes filled with tears. The transparent tears eventually fell and landed on Rafael\u2019s palm. Startled by this, Rafael withdrew his hand as if he had been burned.\u201cAre you crying?\u201dRafael drunkenly looked up at Annette\u2019s face with soft eyes. Annette calmly wiped her tears and swallowed her grief. Due to the strict education of the Bavarian family, she was used to hiding her feelings. Annette, who skillfully concealed the wounds of her heart, calmly said,\u201cI know why you\u2019re talking in that way, Rafael. I understand. But you are my only husband, and I regard you as a precious family member. I mean it.\u201dAnnette smiled sadly with red eyes. Then Rafael, who was looking up at her with a look of disapproval, repeated what he had said earlier.\u201cBut I hate you.\u201dWhen Annette heard that, she felt suffocated. Before her calm demeanor could fall apart, she quickly got up and got off the bed. Perhaps she was the only one who thought that this marriage was better than before.Annette returned to her room and couldn\u2019t sleep all night. She was determined to protect Rafael by fighting against her father\u2019s tyranny. But after listening to Rafael\u2019s drunken words, her mind changed a little.\u2018Is it possible for me to protect Rafael in the first place? He is\u2026 suffering because of me.\u2019In fact, there was only one effective solution. She just didn\u2019t want to admit it.For Rafael\u2019s life to be comfortable, Annette had to leave him. Then her father would not be able to use her to ask for something from Rafael. Besides, he wouldn\u2019t have to look at her awful face anymore. He would feel more relaxed then.Annette laughed bitterly. Unlike others, she got to live twice, but Annette could not live peacefully in either lives. She tried her best every moment, but why couldn\u2019t she always get away from being treated as a nuisance? When she remembered her father\u2019s cold face, which she hadn\u2019t seen for a long time,it made her feel sadder.\u2018Yes, let\u2019s find a way tomorrow.\u2019She could not dream of a new life without any preparation or direction. Even if she returned and improved her conditions than before, Annette was still a flower in a greenhouse. So, this time, before leaving the greenhouse, she was going to prepare as thoroughly as possible. So that she wouldn\u2019t wither like she did in her previous life.Annette tried hard to sleep, lowering her wet eyelashes with sadness. She hoped that tomorrow would be a better day.The next day, Rafael got out of bed clutching his head. He was in a bad condition because he couldn\u2019t sleep due to the terrible hangovers and sleepwalking. However, today\u2019s sword training could not be skipped. All that Rafael had now was obtained only by the tip of his sword.\u2018Now it won\u2019t be long before I become the Sword Master.\u2018Rafael washed his face and wore his training suit with terribly exhausted eyes. He couldn\u2019t afford to collapse now at the last step of his goal. Rafael knew a number of warriors who failed to get through this final stage. So he was more nervous than ever.His face reflected in the mirror looked terrible. The area around his blue eyes was sore, his beard was overgrown and his skin had a dull complexion. If you looked at this skeleton, how could a woman like Annette Bavaria like that?\u2018Yes she must hate it too. Come to think of it, I felt like I saw Annette before I went to bed yesterday.\u2019He couldn\u2019t remember the conversation he had with her, but he remembered the tears that had fallen from Annette\u2019s petal like eyes. Rafael reflexively looked down at his palm. The dirty feeling got even worse.\u201cFuck.\u201dIn fact, Annette was doing better than he thought. Even though she was from prideful Bavaria, she wasn\u2019t arrogant and respected him, an illegitimate child as her husband. Not only that, she never got angry with him, no matter how mean he was. He truly wanted to pay homage to her amazing patience.Seeing that Annette even cried, it seemed he was too drunk yesterday and spoke quite harshly to her. Rafael smiled bitterly, thinking he had nothing to say if she wanted a divorce. Somehow the word \u201cdivorce\u201d evoked a creepy feeling in his heart.\u2018Maybe I\u2019m feeling like that because of my mood.\u2019Rafael\u2019s footsteps stopped as he was going downstairs. It was because he could see Annette humming softly by the window of the drawing room. The moment she met his eyes, Annette suddenly stopped humming.\u2018Are you angry?\u2019Rafael looked at her with a blank gaze.. It was natural to expect her to hate a drunk husband who went in late and spat out curses. As he waited for Annette to turn away from him, he nervously clenched his fist. He wasn\u2019t even aware of his own emotions.But Annette smiled at him, as if nothing had happened. There was no resentment directed towards him in her eyes. Annette got up from her seat and approached him slowly.Rafael couldn\u2019t say anything and just watched her approach him. Soon, she stopped in front of him and greeted him kindly.\u201cHi, Rafael. Did you sleep well? How are you feeling?\u201dRafael clenched his fists more tightly.\u2018How could this woman smile and talk like this to me?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was so small and dazzling, that he couldn\u2019t help but look at her with a frown.When Annette saw Rafael\u2019s frowning face, she became anxious. Perhaps it was because he couldn\u2019t sleep well last night. Annette tried to advise Rafael as calmly as possible, even though she knew he would just dismiss it cold-heartedly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, why don\u2019t you have a cup of tea with me? I\u2019m drinking herbal tea, and it\u2019s good for headaches and fatigue.\u201dRafael shrugged and didn\u2019t say anything. As expected, he ignored her words and left without saying anything. Annette\u2019s shoulders, after being rejected, slumped a little. At that moment, Rafael urged her in a harsh tone without looking back.\u201cWhat are you doing? Let\u2019s drink tea.\u201dUnexpectedly, Annette\u2019s eyes widened and she looked at his broad back stupidly. Rafael quickly strode forward as if not wanting to wait for her. He went to the sofa near the window where Annette had just been sitting and sat down.\u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019Rafael was confused by his own actions. She was the daughter of the Bavarian Duke who always looked down on him, but he couldn\u2019t understand why he felt sorry for hurting her and coming home drunk. He decided to have a cup of tea with her to fulfill a husband\u2019s duty. He wanted to quickly get out of this uncomfortable situation as soon as possible.Annette, who was not aware of Rafael\u2019s internal conflict, smiled and poured him a cup of tea. She was just happy to spend time with him after a long time, without having any quarrels. She was going to ask Rafael if he knew what her father wanted from him.A fragrant tea flowed from the pretty antique teapot. When he smelled the strong scent of the herbal tea, he felt refreshed. Rafael savored the warm tea and enjoyed the feeling of relaxation as his taut nerves became loose. He casually looked at Annette who was reaching for the book she had been reading earlier.\u201cYou seem to like books, right?\u201dRafael asked, recalling the time when Annette was reading in the garden before. Annette replied with a soft smile.\u201cYes. But I don\u2019t like it that much\u2026 It\u2019s just I don\u2019t have a lot of hobbies to do indoors. You know, in Deltium, white skin is preferred, right? That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t gone out much in the sun since I was young. Whenever I went outside, everyone would become nervous about my skin getting tanned or me falling and hurting myself. It was uncomfortable, so I couldn\u2019t go out much.\u201dRafael\u2019s eyes gently glanced over Annette. The slender limbs, snow-white skin, and delicate face made her look like a high end porcelain doll crafted by an artisan. However, Annette, who talked about her past memories with a sad face, was clearly a living person.\u2018I guess it must be tiring to live upto the Bavarian family\u2019s expectations.\u2019Rafael, who was casually thinking about it, soon hardened his expression. No matter how she lived in Bavaria, Annette would not have experienced starving or freezing in the cold. Rafael clenched his teeth, recalling his ugly past, filled with filth and misery. The sufferings he had to go through because of his dirty birth, was something that the prideful Rafael would never reveal to anyone, even if he died.Fortunately, his father, King Selgratis, did his best, so nothing was known about his mother\u2019s side. If it becomes known, the nobles of Deltium who still despised him, would surely jump at this opportunity to tear him apart.Rafael\u2019s masculine, angled chin became stiff. To shake off this filthy feeling, he spit out an insincere remark.\u201cI don\u2019t like white skin because it looks sick.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dAnnette\u2019s gentle eyes drooped as if she was disappointed. She bowed her head and looked down at her pale arms. Because of this, Rafael became nervous as he couldn\u2019t see her face.\u2018Why do you keep saying nonsense like this?\u2019Somehow, he always managed to stir a disaster. Rafael, who was unhappy with himself, clicked his tongue and turned his head away. Looking at Annette\u2019s depressed face, he strangely felt guilty.Just then, Annette with her arms outstretched, gently grasped his hand. Then she asked him with shy and quivering eyes.\u201cThen Rafael, if I tan my skin\u2026 Will you then like me a little bit?\u201dAnnette\u2019s rose-like pink eyes, surrounded by golden eyelashes, blinked and looked up at him. At the innocent yet provocative question, Rafael felt his heart sink.\u201cStop talking nonsense.\u201dRafael couldn\u2019t remember what he said last night. So, he didn\u2019t know why Annette, who was bothered by his \u201cI hate you,\u201d asked such a question. She knew she would get hurt again, but she still desperately gathered her courage to face him.When Rafael saw Annette\u2019s quivering eyes, he suddenly felt a chill in his heart. He hated to admit it, but it felt like some kind of fear. He felt a strange anxiety at the thought of him collapsing in front of this little woman, one day. It was a very strange feeling.\u201cI\u2019ve finished drinking tea, so I\u2019m leaving.\u201dRafael jumped out of his seat and coldly shook off Annette\u2019s hand. He quickly turned his back away as if he was eager to escape out of here. Even though she expected this, still his cold-hearted attitude hurt her again.Annette, who was left alone in the empty place, dejectedly lowered her eyelashes. A pure white hand trembled in the air and then fell down powerlessly. Having lost all courage, she slid down in front of the empty table all alone.There was still a light steam rising from Rafael\u2019s teacup. The steam fluttered in the air, swaying as if it was laughing at Annette. Looking at this, she finally decided to accept the painful reality.\u2018I guess we can\u2019t\u2026 Rafael,\u2026. he hates me.\u2019In fact, she felt sorry for Rafael. He was forced to marry her to compensate for his illegitimate origin. Because of this, he was also caught up in the bad rumors about Annette who could not become a Crown Princess.Still, it must have been a really unpleasant marriage from Rafael\u2019s point of view. His own in-laws looked down upon him because of his birth. How disgusted he must be to see such people trying to take something from him. That must be why Rafael looked at her so coldly.\u2018If Rafael was a bad guy, I could have hated him now as much as I did when I didn\u2019t know anything.\u2019Annette\u2019s face was distorted. Her face reflected in the tea was both crying and smiling, which was truly bizarre. She was well aware that Rafael\u2019s nature was not so bad. However, in order to survive in the harsh environment, he had to become a beast.When Annette was bedridden and abandoned by her family, only Rafael was willing to stay by her side. He took care of her until she died. Although he might not have loved her, he faithfully kept his loyalty to her until the end.After all, the problem wasn\u2019t Rafael. The enmity around him constantly tormented him, feeding fire to his sharp temper. No one believed in him and most of the enemies used Annette as a bow to fire at him. Annette finally decided to admit that Rafael could only be happy if she left him. After deeply contemplating for a while, she slowly got up from her seat.From now on, she would find a new path and there was a lot of work to do for it.* * *The beauty with luscious colorful purple hair hanging long down behind her back, tapped the table with her fingertips. White skin, cat-like provocative eyes, and the little mole around her mouth were all very enchanting. But surprisingly, this beauty was not a woman, but a man.The man\u2019s red eyes, which looked like rubies, glanced gently over Annette sitting across him. Although Annette had covered her face with a long veil, she could not deceive his eyes. The man immediately noticed that Annette was a very precious person.\u201cHmm.\u201dRailin, the head of the smuggling guild \u201cSecret,\u201d eventually cleared his throat with a couple of false coughs. He then started off with a soft voice.\u201cYou\u2019re looking for a reliable foreign job? Have you thought about which kingdom you will go to?\u201d\u201cYes. If possible, the Kingdom of Osland would be good. I heard it\u2019s a good place to live.\u201dAnnette answered in a calm voice. Osland was a kingdom having a fairly stable security and well-organized legal system. She hadn\u2019t made up her mind yet, but there was nothing wrong with looking into it beforehand. Annethe was a thorough person, so she liked to be prepared beforehand.\u201cOsland\u2026 it\u2019s a nice place. It\u2019s safe because the legal system is very well established. Well, border crossing is a bit tricky, but it\u2019s not impossible. What can you do? In order to find a job for you, I have to first figure out your ability.\u201dRailin asked, curving his eyes in a beautiful smile. It was a question that would be offensive enough if she was a noble, as there was no word or proof to know what she could do without the status. But Annette didn\u2019t get agitated and calmly listed the things she knew how to do.\u201cAt first, I can read and write in four languages: Deltium\u2019s language , the Continental\u2019s Official language, the Chapelle\u2019s Imperial language, and the Austrian language. So I can do translation or ghostwriting.\u201dAnnette brazenly said this, without considering her bad handwriting. Well, her handwriting wasn\u2019t pretty, but it wasn\u2019t uncomfortable to read. Annette completely believed in the readability of her handwriting. But for some reason, she thought it would be better to appeal with her other strengths.\u201cI\u2019m also good at embroidery. I can do flat embroidery, three-dimensional embroidery, and Hardanger embroidery, Cutwork, and Smocking. I heard Osland\u2019s fashion is quite high standard, isn\u2019t it? And, um, I\u2019m also familiar with management and accounting documents. That\u2019s why it would be nice to work at the top. Of course, if there is a willingness to hire me there.\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201dRailin stared at her with his chin up. That didn\u2019t mean he could see the face behind the veil. But Railin found the mysterious woman quite attractive. Unlike the extravagant aristocratic women, he thought she might be quite clever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was one of the great hands supporting Deltium. Railin\u2019s secret guild, \u2018Secret\u2018 was not limited only to smuggling. He had a number of organizations that ran illegal \u2018errands\u2018, including Information Guilds.Because of this, Railin had to walk tightropes quite often. Contrary to his fine looks, he was a very daring and observant person. He could accurately grasp a person\u2019s character just by listening to the way they spoke. In Railin\u2019s view, Annette was not an easy bet.Her tone was elegant and calm, and she didn\u2019t show any sign of excitement while talking about smuggling. She was like a person who had foreseen the misfortunes of the future and was looking for a way out. In a word, it didn\u2019t seem like a careless attempt made by an immature Lady to run away.\u2018You look like a lady from a noble family, what\u2019s making you suffer so much?\u2019Railin was very interested in her. Even though he was involved in the Underworld, he was very picky with his tastes. He liked elegant and noble things, just like Annette who was sitting in front of him. Her breathing pattern, her sitting posture and her every hand gesture was full of grace.In exchange for not revealing her identity, Annette paid a huge advance. When Railin received it, she was sure he could find her a good job with that. However, Railin didn\u2019t want their relationship to end there. Anyway, Railin\u2019s \u2018business\u2019 dealt with a wide range of things, so if he was lucky, they would continue to meet in future. Railin concluded the consultation by keeping his personal curiosity aside.\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll send you reports of some of the Osland\u2019s livable villages and jobs in as much detail as possible. If you change your mind or have more questions, you can always use this ring to contact me.\u201dRailin, with a bright business-like smile, held out a ring. The ring with a large amethyst set in it, was engraved with the \u2018S\u2019 logo in gold. It was the symbol of the Secret Guild ran by Railin .Annette happily picked up the ring. If she was going to be smuggled out of the country, she needed to lay the groundwork in advance. In Deltium, \u2018Annette Bavaria Carnesis\u2019 needed to be at least missing, or in some cases, needed to be disguised, as meeting with an accident. That way, the pursuit would not follow Annette in the future.\u2018No, I don\u2019t think I need to worry about someone tracking me.\u2019A bitter smile appeared on the face covered with a veil. There was no way the family who had abandoned her would wonder about her life and death. It was pointless to even think about it. At least her brother Arjen and her new sister-in-law Claire would be worried. She was going to somehow tell them the news separately.\u2018And Rafael\u2026\u2019Annette, who remembered her husband, was heartbroken. It was because she remembered the appearance of the drunk Rafael who said he hated her. He didn\u2019t look very happy. Maybe it was because he married her.There were many things she felt sorry for Rafael, and there were many things she wanted to improve in this deteriorating relationship. For this reason, Annette tried to get along with him, but what was impossible was.. simply impossible.Annette bit her lips and gripped the amethyst ring in her hand tightly. If Rafael hated her so much, the only thing Annette could do for him now was to disappear from his sight. If she disappeared, she knew Rafael would be unable to sleep at night. But still he would be fine. At least his worries would disappear.* * *Even after returning to the mansion, Annette could not sleep easily. Her fingertips skimmed over the gold foil on the headboard of the luxurious bed. Since she was born into the Bavarian family, she naturally got used to these high-end goods and luxuries. So she was afraid of being alone, which was something that was going to begin now.In fact, she did think about going to the Chapelle Empire, where her brother and his wife lived. However if Annette\u2019s smuggling were to be known, they would be harmed as well. Arjen and Claire held high office positions, so she didn\u2019t want them to get penalized because of her.It was for this reason, Annette boldly decided to choose the kingdom of Osland. She thoughtlessly looked out of the window, contemplating how to make detailed plans for the future. Then she was surprised to see the position of the moon.\u201cOh, it\u2019s already time.\u201dAccustomed to her regular life, Annette lay down on the bed and went to sleep. But she couldn\u2019t sleep because she had a lot of thoughts plaguing her mind. She would have to prepare thoroughly for at least a few months to leave Deltium.The night was so quiet today that she could even hear her own heartbeats. Annette lay on the bed dazed, blinking her eyes, and suddenly she pricked up her ears. It seemed like something was coming from outside and was right in front of her bedroom.\u2018The sound of human footsteps?\u2019The mysterious footsteps were wandering from front of her bedroom to between the hallways. Carefully approaching the front of her bedroom, Annette put her ears to the door and closed her eyes. It wasn\u2019t an illusion, but the sound of footsteps was really coming from outside the door.\u2018Oh my god, it\u2019s not a ghost, is it?\u2019Annette trembled in fear. At first, she thought it was a maid, but at this time, no maid would disturb the hostess\u2019 sleep by cleaning the hallway in front of her bedroom. Above all, the sound of footsteps was too heavy for a woman. Annette asked, trying to calm down her fear.\u201cWho\u2019s out there?\u201dOf course no one answered back. Rather, the sound of footsteps stopped suddenly and there was an unsettling silence. She couldn\u2019t breathe. She was scared that whatever was outside the bedroom would barge inside. Fortunately, as she was about to shout for someone, a faint murmur came from outside the door.\u201cNo\u2026.. I didn\u2019t really mean to abandon you\u2026 That was the only way then.\u201dThe murmurs from the outside sounded dull and confused. But the low voice was something that Annette knew very well.\u201cRafael?\u201dAfter knowing who was outside the door, Annette\u2019s fear disappeared and was replaced by worry. Of course, she was sad and angry when she thought of Rafael being cold to her. But apart from that, she was worried about Rafael\u2019s condition. He seemed to be wandering in another terrible nightmare.Annette carefully pushed open the bedroom door slowly. The faint light of the lamp, leaking from the inside lit up the man\u2019s sculpted face. Rafael was half-naked and his pants hung dangerously low on his hips. Maybe he just came out of bed, because he barely walked in his pants. With his eyes tightly closed, he was sweating profusely, as if he was being tormented.\u201cI wanted to save you too, Robert\u2026. The enemies over the moat\u2026. I shouldn\u2019t have abandoned you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWords flowed out between his rough breaths, and soon disappeared, as if buried in the stillness of the night. He was beating himself up. Behind his closed eyelids she could see his eyes moving.\u201cRafael, are you okay?\u201dAnnette quickly approached him and spoke in a soft voice. However, her voice went unheard as Rafael was trapped in the depths of his dream. Rafael stood facing the wall of the cold corridor, frowning his beautiful eyebrows. Then, he began to pound his forehead against the wall.\u201cI\u2019m cowardly,\u2026weak\u2026..I deserve to die.\u201dThe intensity of Rafael hitting his forehead against the wall grew stronger and stronger as he continued to deprecate himself. The trauma was so severe that despite the impact on his forehead, Rafael showed no sign of waking up. At this rate, his forehead was sure to bruise if he went on like this.\u201cRafael, what\u2019s wrong? Stop!!\u201dSurprised, Annette jumped up quickly and wrapped his forehead with her hand. This prevented Rafael\u2019s forehead from bruising, but instead her little hand was crushed quite forcefully against the wall. Annette almost screamed in pain, but she bit her lips tightly and held it in.As she hugged Rafael, the coldness from his naked torso permeated her skin. It seemed that he had been wandering outside for quite a while. Feeling sorry for him, Annette did her best to distance him from the wall.\u201cCome here, Rafael. Come on. It\u2019s too cold and dark in here, isn\u2019t it?\u201dAnnette hastily brought him into her bedroom before he began to hurt himself again. Her bedroom was filled with a gentle glow of light, and scent of herb potpourri, which helped her to sleep well. Maybe he felt it when he was unconscious, but Rafael\u2019s painfully distorted expression became much better.Annette, who managed to lay Rafael on her bed, quickly looked down at her hand, thinking that her hand that struck the wall while shielding Rafael\u2019s forehead wasn\u2019t so badly injured. However, her fingers were now numb as if electricity were flowing through them, and the third and fourth fingers began to swell.\u2018I hope it\u2019s not a fracture.\u2019Annette looked down at her hand with an anxious gaze. Rafael, still confused and trapped in his nightmare, groaned from behind.\u201cI wanted to\u2026 save you, Robert,\u201d\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if you could save my fingers first,\u201d Annette thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I just bumped into the wall.\u2019Looking down at her swollen fingers, Annette somehow felt unfair. Suddenly, she remembered the words of a practitioner who had been watching over her illness in her previous life. She said Annette was born with a \u201cpygostyle*\u201d constitution and advised her to be careful because she was prone to bone damage. \u2018I guess that was true.\u2019[T/N: Pygostyle is actually a skeletal condition in which the final few caudal vertebrae are fused into a single ossification, supporting the tail feathers and musculature. It is found in birds\u2026 so i have no idea why the author has used this for Annette. ]Anyway, she could only call a practitioner the next morning. Annette looked away from her swollen hands and turned her gaze to Rafael. He was crouching on her bed with his eyes closed and was sweating profusely. Looking at his painful expression , Annette felt sorry for him as he still couldn\u2019t escape from the trauma of the past wars.\u201cIt\u2019s all right now, Rafael. You\u2019re not bad. Nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201dAnnette reached out her other hand and stroked his black hair gently. Her small, warm hand stroked his handsome face and swept his disheveled hair behind his ears. Then she gently touched his wrinkled forehead. Rafael\u2019s unstable breathing began to subside slowly.Rafael, with a sharp face, was a very manly handsome man. It would be great if he smiled a little with that face, but sadly, Rafael only frowned whenever he saw her. Annette whispered sweetly, looking down at him with sad eyes.\u201cDeltium is safe because you fought bravely in the war. Nothing can hurt you now. I\u2019ll protect you from now on, so don\u2019t worry and sleep well now.\u201dAnnette\u2019s gentle whispers were already like a song in itself. Rafael who had been clenching his teeth because of the nightmare, relaxed and his jaw slackened a little. Annette reached out and patted his cold bare shoulders. Then she opened her mouth and began to sing a lullaby.\ud83c\udfb6Good night, lovely girlWhen evening primroses with dew are in full bloomWhen the silver ring by the window shines warmly in the sunYou will have a good sleep\u2026.\ud83c\udfb6It seemed like she was now getting used to using her abilities. Rafael fell asleep with a relaxed expression. Annette pulled the quilt over his rigid, muscular torso and covered it gently. When he was awake, he only spoke hateful words, and when he was asleep, he looked like an angel. Looking at the shadows of the long lashes falling on his handsome face, she almost let out a sigh.\u2018Will the day come when this face would fade away from my memory and I won\u2019t be even able to remember it?\u2019Annette thought and shook her head. No, maybe not. There\u2019s no way she could forget a face like this. With a bitter smile on her face, Annette reached out and touched Rafael\u2019s sharp nose. He was sleeping so deeply that he allowed Annette to touch him defenselessly. It was very different from the usual sensitive Rafael.Somehow, Annette\u2019s ability seemed to work better for tired people. Otherwise, it would work for less than 5 minutes if she used it on someone who was not sleepy or was in good spirits. Just like when she forced Gerard to sleep in the middle of the day.\u201cGood night, Rafael.\u201dAnnette crouched, lying quietly beside him and then closed her eyes. She could hear Rafael\u2019s calm breathing as he slept deeply. In her previous life, she had never slept together with Rafael, but looking back like this, it didn\u2019t seem bad. Thanks to this, she now had more memories to take with her before leaving Deltium.Annette closed her eyes quietly. Her injured hand was throbbing a little, but she thought it would be fine if she called the practitioner as soon as she woke up next morning. For the first time in her life, she felt that she was not alone.The next morning, Rafael opened his eyes languidly. Before he even got up, he could feel that he was in his best condition. \u2018I must have slept well last night.\u2019It was good to practice on a day like this, as he could further strengthen his swordsmanship skills. Maybe this time he could break through to become the Sword Master. Rafael, who opened his eyes in anticipation, suddenly became stiff and made a surprised face.\u2018Annette Bavaria?\u2019Annette was sleeping, in a position facing him. The delicate features of the palm-sized white face were just like a doll. Only the radiant blush on her closed eyes and cheeks proved that she was alive.Rafael slowly glanced over at her sleeping face. Annette\u2019s long blond hair, and her white shoulders which were slightly exposed through her chemise, all sparkled in sunlight. Seeing this, Rafael somehow felt uncomfortable and he turned his eyes away. Whenever he looked at Annette these days, he felt unpleasant as if a corner of his chest was tightening strangely.Rafael raised his upper body and looked around the room, clutching his slightly throbbing forehead. The room smelled of fragrant herbs and was decorated with pure white furniture. Looking at the cozy carpets on the floor and the cherry blossom curtains fluttering over the window, it was clear that it was Annette\u2019s bedroom.\u2018Why did I sleep here?\u2019Rafael\u2019s eyebrows wrinkled badly. He seemed to have walked all the way to Annette\u2019s bedroom because of his damn sleepwalking. Until now, no matter how severe his illness was, he had never come out of the bedroom. Seeing this, he was completely caught off guard. So he decided to lock his bedroom in the future.\u2018You didn\u2019t see it, did you?\u2019Rafael had no idea what he did while he was asleep. He could only make a guess. Sometimes when he woke up in the morning, he would find his eyes sore, his hands broken, and his throat hurt and sore. Considering this, it could be quite ugly.The prideful Rafael was horrified by the idea of him begging and dragging his body around outside. If Annette ever saw that\u2026\u2026! It was humiliating to just think about it. So he clenched his teeth and looked at Annette fiercely.\u201cWake up, Annette.\u201dRafael gritted his teeth and reached out to wake up Annette. He was going to ask her whether she had witnessed the mortifying moment last night. But Annette was sleeping so deeply that she didn\u2019t wake up even when he shook her body.\u201cHmm\u2026Rafael.\u201dAnnette reacted unconsciously, but her long, curled eyelashes showed no sign of opening her eyes. The short-tempered Rafael growled, grasping her small face in one hand and shaking it from side to side.\u201cWake up, Annette, right now!\u201dAt that moment, Annette\u2019s slender body slumped under his grasp. Feeling something was unusual, Rafael was stunned and stopped trying to wake her up.\u201cWhat is this? Come on!\u201dAnnette couldn\u2019t open her eyes and was very weak and helpless in his hands. The delicate texture of the neck as it drooped unusually made Rafael\u2019s chest sink. It was only then that Rafael realized that Annette\u2019s condition was not good.\u201cWhy are you doing this all of a sudden?\u201dInstantly his anger turned into embarrassment. Rafael was flustered as he looked at Annette\u2019s condition. He thought her body temperature was high because she was asleep, but now he could see her temperature was unusually high. He realised Annette\u2019s cheeks, which were a bright red, were flushed because of the fever.The embarrassed Rafael didn\u2019t know what to do and woke Annette very carefully. Once he woke her up, he could ask where she was sick. The moment his hand touched her arm, Annette suddenly recoiled and groaned in pain.\u201cAh!\u201dAnnette, who reflexively wrapped her hand around the injured area, sniffed in pain. Rafael\u2019s gaze turned to her right hand. Annette\u2019s hand was so swollen that he wondered why he had just noticed it now. Rafael, who was well informed about injuries, knew what was wrong with her hands.\u2018It\u2019s a fracture.\u2019Fever was also one of the side effects of fractures. RafaeI frowned and carefully grabbed her hand to examine it. Her small hand was so fragile that it seemed it would crumble even with a little force. Her hand was a little warm. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t a very severe fracture, but Annette\u2019s body was so weak and frail, that even such a small injury was enough to make her suffer greatly.\u201cOpen your eyes, Annette, are you very sick?\u201dRafael grabbed her cheek and shook it anxiously. Then Annette managed to open her eyes and looked up at him. Tears rolled down her pink eyes and she looked very pained. Seeing this, Rafael\u2019s heart was strangely hot. Just in time, Annette whispered softly.\u201cRafael\u2026. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m feeling well.\u201dRafael clenched his teeth instead of answering her. When the tears running down her cheek fell on his hand, he felt hot and painful as if he had been burned. He found it ridiculous that someone\u2019s tears could hurt. Rafael got up in a hurry, not knowing why he was doing this.\u201cStay here for a moment, Annette.\u201dRapelle hurried out of the bedroom and went downstairs. He jumped over several steps and sprinted down the stairs. In a flash, he arrived downstairs and grabbed the servants around him, screaming violently.\u201cPractitioner, call a practitioner now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/How to Tame My Beastly HusbandChapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRafael leaned on the chair by the bed and grasped his chin. A practitioner, who was halfway dragged by the employees of the Carnesis Mansion, trembled while examining Annette. It was the same practitioner who had visited the mansion to prove Annette\u2019s \u2018innocence\u2019 before.In front of Rafael, the young practitioner in his early 30s was as nervous as a rat who had met a snake. Before RafaeI\u2019s beastly eyes, the practitioner recoiled and shuddered, while expressing his opinion.\u201cThe fever is due to the inflammation caused by the fracture. The fracture has been corrected, so if Madam takes the inflammatory drug I prescribed and take a good rest, she will get better soon.\u201dThe doctor who wrote the prescription tremblingly, looked at Rafael with eyes wanting to say something. In response, Rafael glared at him with a fierce look.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dRafael thought he wanted to say something like, \u201cIt looks like a husband hit his wife.\u201d Of course, it was just Rafael\u2019s delusion, but he felt really unpleasant because of that. It was because there was a possibility\u2026All Annette held in that little hand was a book and her mantle. Surely they couldn\u2019t have been dangerous enough to fracture her finger bones. And considering the fact that Annette was fine until yesterday afternoon, the culprit was probably himself. Rafael\u2019s eyes, which had become sore from sleepwalking, became grim.However, contrary to Rafael\u2019s thoughts, the practitioner did not doubt him at all. Even though the practitioner was intimidated by Rafael\u2019s aura, he pushed out something with his trembling hands. It was a letter of introduction.\u201cThere is a very capable female practitioner around here. Apparently, Madam seems to have a weak constitution, but if this is the case, wouldn\u2019t it be better if she\u2019s taken care by another woman? Well, if you don\u2019t mind, I can arrange a meeting.\u201dDespite his fear, the practitioner steadfastly recommended a colleague, and then quickly left the mansion as if he was running away. Looking at his running back, it seemed that he would never step in this direction again. The recommendation of a colleague probably was to push in another scapegoat to suffer on his behalf.\u201cWhat, take care of each other? That\u2019s not funny.\u201dRafael frowned and tried to resist throwing away the letter of introduction given by the practitioner. As the practitioner said, Annette was very small and weak. So, it wasn\u2019t a bad idea to have a female practitioner work as the chief physician of the Carnesis family.Most aristocratic families already had their own family doctors. But the Carnesis was a newly-acquired title purely because of Rafael\u2019s ability, and he was the first Marquis in the Deltium kingdom. The mansion had just been built a few years ago, and still had the smell of a new house, so he was not able to hire a separate doctor.Rafael clicked his tongue but eventually put in a separate letter of introduction. Later, when Annette woke up, he was going to ask about her opinions on this. He didn\u2019t realize he was paying attention to Annette\u2019s opinion for the first time.Annette\u2019s mind was confused. This was because of the fever and inflammation caused by the fracture. The mental shock and fatigue caused by the regression, and the stress and worry she felt because of Rafael accumulated one after the other, and finally exploded. In addition, she decided to smuggle herself out of the country and paid attention to this and that. So it was natural for Annette, who had a weak constitution, to become sick.Rafael sat in a narrow chair by the bed and frowned. It had already been two days since Annette\u2019s fever. The furnitures in Annette\u2019s bedroom were of small size to match her body. So a large, well-built man like Rafael had to fold his body in order to sit down. Rafael, sitting in an uncomfortable position, looked at Annette with a wry look.A bandage was wrapped around Annette\u2019s right hand which was protruding out from the blanket. Her bandaged right hand was thicker than her slender wrist and seemed as if she was wearing mittens. Strangely, Rafael found the hand ugly. Unwilling to see it anymore, he pushed it back into the blanket. Rafael then reached out to measure Annette\u2019s body temperature and muttered ferociously.\u201cThat damn quack. He said she would get better soon.\u201dAnnette\u2019s fever did not go down easily even after taking the medicine prescribed by the practitioner. Rafael had never taken care of anyone, but strangely, he felt as if he was used to nursing Annette. He carefully woke her up, gave her the medicine, and then wiped her nape and cheeks with a wet towel. He did all this very skillfully as if he had done this a lot.His hand, which had only wielded a sword so far, was astonishingly nursing someone. Thanks to this, Annette\u2019s condition was becoming quite stable. However, there was only one problem in this situation\u2026\u2018Why am I doing this?\u2019Rafael recalled the troubles he had repeated countless times over the past two days. It was enough to give this work to any of the numerous maids working in the mansion. If he wanted to, he could have Annette get a different maid every hour so that she could receive the best care.But, why couldn\u2019t he leave her side and went as far to personally take care of her?To solve this unanswered question, Rafael locked himself up in his room and drank alcohol on purpose. However, he eventually came back to her bedroom in an intoxicated state. There was an anxiety that he felt whenever he wasn\u2019t near Annette. He couldn\u2019t even explain it himself, but he couldn\u2019t bear not being around her because he thought Annette would suddenly stop breathing if he was not there.He himself didn\u2019t know what the hell he was thinking. Looking at the unfortunate Bavarian woman, who looked so pretty, he thought he was going crazy.\u2018Well, she is truly very pretty.\u2019Rafael\u2019s deep blue eyes glanced over Annette\u2019s face. Even though she hadn\u2019t washed her face for two days, she still looked so pretty that he felt ashamed of himself. Before she got married to him, she was considered one of the best bride candidates in the Deltium\u2019s high society, so he didn\u2019t know whether he was worthy of her.Yes, it was all because of that little wicked face of Annette. That Bavarian woman had a needlessly pretty appearance, so it must be a mistake that she ended up with a jerk like him.Rafael grinded his teeth and looked down at Annette with bloody eyes. Maybe she felt a sense of crisis while she was asleep, but Annette frowned, making her forehead wrinkle. She then groaned a little in pain.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dHer lips, which were too red for her white face, parted a little. Rafael felt awkward and a little irritated at seeing Annette sleeping comfortably with her mouth wide open, oblivious to all his troubles. Frowning, he reached out and touched her luscious lips.Then Annette suddenly closed her lips and gently sucked the tip of his index finger. She seemed to be dreaming of eating something. Her soft lips, like petals, wrapped around his finger, and her small moist tongue moved around as if she was sucking a candy. The texture of her little tongue felt on his sensitive fingertip was so hot and sweet that he thought he would go crazy.Rafael became stiff and looked down at the face of Annette, who was sucking his finger. Her lips were stretched and her face looked very innocent. Seeing her pretty lips devour his finger, he wanted to put something other than his finger in there.Suddenly, his lower body became stiff. Rafael was startled as if he had been burned. He hurriedly took his finger out of Annette\u2019s mouth and then immediately ran out of her bedroom. Swear words flowed out of Rafael\u2019s distorted mouth. He couldn\u2019t understand the sudden anger that he felt. But it was clear to him that one day, that desolate woman, Annette Bavaria would creep into his heart and set it on fire.Annette\u2019s head was blank. She felt like she ate something delicious in her dream. Annette groaned and lifted her heavy eyelids. The bright afternoon sunlight blinded her eyes. Because of this, Annette\u2019s eyesight returned only after blinking for three or four times.The first thing that caught her eye was the familiar view of her room. Annette woke up and looked dazedly at the small dust particles floating in the air. Her hearing recovered only one step later than her sight and a strange sound flowed into Annette\u2019s ears.It\u2019s just\u2026It was a small sound of something metallic hitting regularly. Annette lifted her head and looked up in the direction of the sound. Surprisingly, she found Rafael sitting there.Rafael, with a strangely dissatisfied expression, looked very cold and sharp. He was sitting awkwardly in a cream-colored chair that was much smaller than his size. Annette stared at him blankly, wondering why he was sitting there.With something in his hand, Rafael was making this strange noise by hitting it against the bedside table with a bored expression. Annette lifted her eyes to see the object in Rafael\u2019s hand, and was startled when she saw what it really was.\u2018That ring\u2026..!\u2019It was the ring that Annette received from Railin, the leader of the smuggling guild. She was sure she had hid it in a drawer, but she couldn\u2019t understand how it ended up in Rafael\u2019s hands. A surprised Annette, reflexively raised her upper body. Rafael, who sensed her movements, turned his head.\u201cGood. You woke up just in time.\u201dRafael with a stiff face raised his body and got up from the chair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After making sure that Annette was awake, he got up to leave the bedroom. As he was about to cross the threshold, he randomly put the ring on the shelf, as if he had forgotten about it. Judging from his indifferent attitude, fortunately Rafael seemed to have no idea about the ring.\u2018Where did you find that?\u2019Annette\u2019s heart was pounding violently. Rafael probably found it by accident in Annette\u2019s room and started playing with it. This little play almost made Annette\u2019s heart stop beating.When Rafael left the bedroom completely, Annette got up helplessly with her trembling legs and picked up the ring. As she stretched her right hand out, she saw there was a bandage wrapped around it. Annette, who was looking down at it eagerly, recalled the pain she felt in her sore hand the day before yesterday.\u2018Oh, no. I guess I really had a fracture.\u201dAnnette sighed deeply. She had boasted to Railin last time, saying, \u201cI can do embroidery, translation, and ghostwriting.\u201d But now that she had hurt her hand like this, she felt a little dispirited. If the aftereffects of the fracture remained, it would be difficult to do any work.Anyway, it would take at least a few more months to prepare for her smuggling. Annette picked up the ring with her left hand, hoping that her fingers would heal before that. And she then hid it carefully by pushing it into the deepest part of her jewelry box.At this time, a sudden knock came from outside. Frightened, Annette quickly put the jewelry box in and asked,\u201cWho, who is it?\u201d\u201cMadame, this is Ellie. I heard you\u2019re up\u2026. so\u2026 do you need help?\u201dThe cautious voice of the maid came from outside. Annette then realized that her body felt quite unpleasant. She didn\u2019t know how long she was unconscious, but it seemed like she had been sick for at least one day.The Carnesis maids checked Annette\u2019s condition and immediately started preparing for the bath. They recommended her to eat a simple meal so that she wouldn\u2019t feel dizzy while taking a bath. Since she had to wait a little for the bath water to heat up anyway, Annette nodded and had the watery soup and fruit juice.\u201cHow long have I been sick?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been two and a half days, madam.\u201d\u201cOh no.\u201dShe had been unconscious longer than what she expected. The body that had lived in bed in the previous life seemed to have encountered trouble again. Annette became depressed, wondering if she might become bedridden again in this life.Annette calmed herself down and quietly stirred the spoon in the soup. At that time, the maids exchanged meaningful gazes with each other and one of them laughed. Seeing Annette puzzled over their sudden behavior, the maid who just laughed, lowered her voice and whispered to Annette.\u201cWhile Madam was ill, Master stayed by your side all the time and took care of you. He adamantly nursed you for over two days without budging. You are lucky to have such a good husband.\u201dAnnette\u2019s spoon as she was moving around the soup bowI suddenly stopped. The maids covered their mouths and laughed with excitement when they saw Annette\u2019s surprised face, as if she couldn\u2019t believe her ears. The good relationship between the newlyweds made the young maids excited.Meanwhile, the dizzy Annette was lost in her thoughts. When she opened her eyes, the first person she saw was Rafael, but at that time she just shrugged it off as a coincidence. She wondered how he would look as he stopped by her room to check her condition and see whether she had opened her eyes. But she didn\u2019t expect him to do that for two and a half days.\u2018Why did he do that?\u2019Annette believed that Rafael\u2019s care for her in her previous life was purely because of his affection. No matter how much he hated her, they had faced each other and even mixed their bodies for five years, so he must have some emotion towards her. Rafael had a rough personality, but his nature was not bad. So he remained a loyal husband to her until her last breath.But after Annette died, she returned and they still ended up getting married. At the beginning of their marriage, Rafael hated her fiercely. It was even more so because there were not enough encounters to increase the intimacy and affection between the couple.Nevertheless, Rafael still took care of her. A few days ago, he even said, \u2018I hate you.\u2018So, there was only one conclusion that Annette could make.\u2018I don\u2019t know if Rafael\u2026I guess he has a weakness for sick people.\u2019Annette sighed and soaked herself in the bath. The maids helped her take a bath and took special care not to let her bandaged right hand touch the water. Truthfully, this fracture and the resulting fever were all caused by Rafael, but she could not blame him since he didn\u2019t do it deliberately and knew nothing about it.So what could she do? She could only pretend to be grateful towards him for his care. When she thought about meeting his bright blue eyes, her heart felt heavy, even after taking a bath in the warm fragrant water. Annette soaked herself in the water until her other unbandaged fingers became white. She barely managed to lift herself from the bath water.* * *Knock knockAnnette knocked on the door and carefully asked,\u201cRafael, are you inside? If you don\u2019t mind, I would like to talk with you.\u201dAnnette habitually tried to hold her hands together in her nervousness, but stopped because of the bandage. She had no choice but to look at the floor and wait for Rafael\u2019s answer. After a while, a very low voice came from inside.\u201cCome in.\u201dBefore opening the door, Annette took one deep breath. It was to prepare her heart from getting hurt. Annette calmed herself down, opened the door and stepped inside.It wasn\u2019t that hard to find Rafael in the big room. He seemed to have just come out of the bath. With a towel hanging loosely on his lower body, Rafael slowly sat on the sofa like a large black panther.Rafael\u2019s eyes, under the thick dark eyelashes, were fierce and beautiful. Before he began to speak, his deep blue eyes stared tenaciously at Annette, as if searching for something.\u201cYou look better now. I think you\u2019re going to live, right?\u201dAs expected, a question filled with sarcasm came out. But Annette, who already knew that he nursed her during her illness, wasn\u2019t very upset. Annette opened her mouth, while carefully approaching Rafael, who was lying down on the sofa.\u201cI heard that you took care of me while I was sick. Thank you, Rafael.\u201dAnnette, who knew Rafael\u2019s personality very well, spoke in a roundabout way. If she had directly said, \u2018Thank you for taking care of me,\u2019 Rafael was more likely to dislike the idea that his actions were caught.Annette was now learning how to communicate with Rafael. Although it was difficult to understand how Rafael was feeling when he twisted his words all the time, she now had a little idea about it. Annette, with a gentle face, expressed the gratitude that she could not convey in her previous life.\u201cThank you very much.\u201dAfter receiving Annette\u2019s thanks, Rafael was silent. His gaze fell on the bandage wrapped around Annette\u2019s right hand. Other than that annoying thing, Annette looked relatively fine. Perhaps maybe because she took a bath and had something to eat, her white pale face now looked quite lively.Seeing this, Rafael felt a perverse whim. While he was nursing her, he suffered all kinds of anguish over his idiot-like appearance, but the person who made him suffer was sleeping well and now her face was shining. Rafael, while lying on the sofa, raised his head and asked in a languid tone.\u201cAre you going to just say thank you in words?\u201d\u201cHuh? What do you\u2026\u201dAnnette, who knew nothing, tilted her head and asked. Then Rafael\u2019s low voice made his appearance look even more insidious. He stared at her as if he was going to eat her up.\u201cAs you said, I took a lot of care of you. Do you think just saying thank you is enough?\u201dFrustrated by this, Annette remained silent for a moment. It was to think about why Rafael was doing this again and what he wanted by saying this to her. However, Annette couldn\u2019t get the right answer. Finally after much deliberation, she asked.\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to give you a thank-you gift\u2026if you want.\u201d\u201cGift? What are you going to give me? I already have a lot of wealth piled up underground.\u201dRafael had received numerous loot for his contribution to the war. So wealth didn\u2019t matter much to him. He laughed coldly, revealing his teeth like a wild beast. That face didn\u2019t seem to ask for a present. Then there was only one answer left. Annette, who had been struggling with her fingers for a while, nervously said,\u201cThen in return for the kindness you have shown me, I will grant you what you want. As far as it\u2019s within my ability.\u201dAnnette was feeling a little indebted to Rafael because of her parents. She was even preparing to leave here, so her heart was heavy looking at Rafael, who knew nothing about all this. If Rafael wanted anything from her, she wanted to grant it as much as she could before they broke up as a parting gift.The moment he heard the words flowing from Annette\u2019s mouth, Rafael who was lying on the sofa, slowly raised himself. As he walked towards her, his torso ripped with muscles magnified in her sight and she felt a little suffocated because of his overbearing aura. Annette, unwittingly took a step back, trying to avoid the approaching hard body.\u201cRa, Rafael?\u201dAnnette\u2019s back hit the wall and she looked up at him with quivering eyes. Rafael slowly pushed Annette into a corner, and then put his hand on the wall and locked her tightly. Rafael bowed his head so that their eyes were at same level and whispered quietly,\u201cYou want to grant me a favor? What the hell do you think I want?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His eyes seemed to want to devour her alive. Seeing this, Annette\u2019s mouth became dry. She felt like a herbivore in front of a dangerous predator. Annette licked her lips without realizing it. At that moment, Rafael reached out and rubbed her lips slowly with his thumb.\u201cTell me, Annette. If I say I want to do something to you, what will you do? Knowing what it is, will you do it?\u201dHis voice lowered to a low husky tone and coiled around her like a snake and clung to her eardrums. When Annette felt a sense of crisis, she tried to shake her body to escape from his grasp but Rafael reached out and pulled her dress down to her shoulders. As her dress slid down helplessly, white breasts peeked out of its collar. Seeing this, Rafael lowered his head and began to lick her chest.\u201cAh, Rafael\u2026\u2026.\u201dThere was a clear desire in his actions of rubbing and pinching her soft breasts. Rafael greedily sucked the tip of her chest and stimulated it by licking and scratching her nipples with his tongue. The nipples, which had been soft up until now, became stiff and erect as his tongue tangled around them.As Annette panted and gasped for breath, his strong hands tightened around her shoulders and waist. Rafael, holding her tightly, began to suck her nipples more fervently. Whenever the small, soft flesh was crushed under the tip of his tongue, she felt a painful and exhilarating pleasure. The stimulation was too strong, but strangely, she thought it would be nice if it was a little more painful.\u201cDon\u2019t struggle like that, Annette\u2026 You\u2019ll hurt your hand.\u201dBefore she knew it, Rafael\u2019s one hand grabbed her bandaged right hand and fixed it to the wall. His other hand rolled up her skirt and plundered her underwear. While touching the slit hidden between her lower petals, he suddenly took his mouth off her breast and looked up at her. Rafael\u2019s handsome mouth whispered in her ears with a twisted smile.\u201cIt\u2019s wet. You got this wet just by sucking your nipples?\u201d\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m not like that\u2026\u201dAnnette, whose face was dyed red in shame, tried to protest. However, Rafael, who was looking at her lips hungrily, covered her lips and didn\u2019t let her finish. He pushed his tongue into her mouth and scratched her sensitive palate, making her let out a crying sound. He pulled her tongue and sucked it so hard, that her knees went weak and she felt very lightheaded.The hand that slipped through the gap between Annette\u2019s legs touched her core. One thick finger easily penetrated inside her because of the wetness between her legs. The fingers eventually stretched to two and then three, moving in and out of her wet core, rubbing her inner walls. Everytime the thick fingers poked her insides, she felt a pleasant throbbing sensation all over her body.Annette was enraptured by the intense sensations exerted up and down her body. She could hear a low, obscene sound coming into her ears. And she could feel a warm drop of tears flowing slowly down from the corner of her reddened eyes.\u201cAnnette, ha\u2026\u2026.\u201dRafael stuck out his tongue and licked her tears up. He hugged Annette and headed straight to the bed. Annette thought he would lay her on the bed, but he didn\u2019t. With Annette sitting on his lap, he took out his erection and rubbed it.\u201cLift your ass, Annette.\u201dRafael, lightly biting Annette\u2019s ears, instructed in a muddy voice filled with desire. Annette hesitated a little, but before she could do anything, a large hand grasped her waist and lifted her up. Rafael pressed his penis against her core and slowly lowered her body down. As the narrow entrance was slowly made to open wide, the thick glans rushed inwards.\u201cIt\u2019s too small, damn it.\u201dRafael grumbled but greedily pushed in his big manhood. Perhaps because of the sitting position, she felt it hit deeper than usual. Her stomach seemed to be full of his penis, so Annette gasped and unwittingly touched her stomach.Seeing this, Rafael slowly closed his eyes and clenched his teeth, as if trying to hold back something. At that moment, the penis that had filled her insides, wriggled, and swelled even more. It was so tight that Annette thought her stomach would burst.\u201cIt\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201dRafael, after muttering some swear words through his evil mouth, soon began to wildly thrust inside her. The thick manhood, that entered all the way to the root, felt terrifying. His desire jammed deep inside her, tightly filled up every crevice of her little hole. Annette\u2019s vision swayed up and down, as a familiar pleasure rose from the inside of her legs. The sensation of Rafael\u2019s manhood going in and out of her, while spreading her narrow tight insides, was very vivid.\u201cAh\u2026yeah..um !\u201dEvery time he pushed in his thick penis, the wet flesh was pushed and pulled, making a sweet shiver flow down her body. Whenever his hard glans pierced her insides deeply, white sparks flashed before her eyes. Due to the overwhelming sensations, Annette couldn\u2019t even make a sound and tears trickled down her cheeks.\u201cAnnette, look at this. Your lower mouth is sucking mine very ravenously.\u201dAs he whispered in her ears, the corners of his mouth lifted in a wicked smile. Even in the midst of this lustful haze, Annette shook her head, letting out a small whimper. Then he wickedly whispered, \u201cLiar.\u201d He grabbed her ass, and began to thrust more quickly.Everytime her body swayed up and down, the clitoris, which was stimulated by the base of his thick penis, was stinging. As her legs trembled, she felt her insides tightening around his penis greedily. As he said, Annette\u2019s vagina tightly clasped his penis, not letting it leave. Under these violent movements, Annette couldn\u2019t help but scream and moan brokenly.\u201cAh\u2026 huh\u2026ngg..ahhh\u2026!\u201dAnnette flinched and tilted her head back. As a terrible orgasm wracked her body, dizzying eelectric sensations spread from her lower body to her head. Even at her peak, the tightly swollen penis continued to squeeze and poke inside. Her tender fleshy walls were in both pain and pleasure through his aggressive wild thrusting. She liked it so much that she felt like she was floating in air.Annette shed tears and unknowingly struggled in his arms. Because of the orgasm, her body felt as if rising in clouds. She was scared of this feeling as her body could crash anytime. However, in these turbulent and raging sensations, the only thing Annette could depend on was the man in front of her.\u201cRafael, Rafael\u2026 !\u201dAnnette reached out desperately and hugged his neck. The gesture seemed somewhat desperate, so Rafael unknowingly bowed his head to make it easier for her to embrace him. It felt quite nice to see the thin arms wrapped around his neck and the soft blonde woman swaying under his chin.Annette shook up and down, frantically gasping for breath. The movements of the penis, as it thrusted inside her without mercy, gave her a terrible delight. She felt so good that she thought she would go crazy.In the face to face position, Rafael reached out and massaged her buttocks. This unintentionally made her vaginal lips stretch and spread to both sides, deepening the friction between the sensitive inner walls. As the vaginal mouth loosened a little, the movement of the penis in and out of it became even more intense.\u201cYour insides are tight again, Annette. Do you like it that much?\u201d\u201cNo.. yes.. ah! Ah, um\u2026 !!\u201dWith a stifling pleasure, Annette\u2019s legs trembled and strained. The second climax was so intense that it made her toes curl. Her insides were so hot that Rafael almost thrusted into it.Rafael waited for Annette to come down from her peak and then turned her back. It was nice to face Annette like this, but looking at her pretty eyes dripping with tears, his heart strangely ached.Now Annette was sitting with her back turned to Rafael in a position that seemed like a child peeing. Rafael, aftermaking sure she was stable in that position, roughly inserted his penis again. Whenever Annette lifted her hips as if wanting to run away from the excessive stimulus, he held onto her waist and pushed in even harder. Annette cried out loud at the ruthless act of driving pleasure.\u201cHuh, ah, uh, uh, uh!\u201dThe cry that leaked out whenever her body shook was very pitiful. Rafael, with his head down, licked and bit her neck and shoulders like a wolf comforting his female. As all of her skin had turned into one erogenous zone, Annette sobbed, not being able to bear such excessive stimulus. The movement of the penis that poked her sensitive spots made her almost faint.Rafael\u2019s hands rubbed her red swollen clitoris, which was hidden between her pubic hair, matted with her love juice and semen. Annette reflexively tightened her inside and trembled. Every time his fingers slided over her clitoris, Annette\u2019s cries got louder. Her inner walls seemed as they would melt away with the pleasure applied from both inside and outside her vagina.\u201cOh, damn it. It\u2019s hot. I\u2019m going crazy, Annette.\u201dWhenever the man\u2019s low growls filled with excitement reached her ear, a shudder ran through her spine. The feeling of his canines* biting down her sensitive back and the warmth of his lips felt really good.[T/N: Well it should be teeth instead of canines, but since Rafael is a beastly man, the author used this for his teeth. After a long debate with myself, I decided to keep what the author used.]\u201cAh, huh, hah huh!\u201dThe moment he pressed the perky clitoris with his fingertips, his eyes turned red. The penis buried all the way inside her swelled up a little and squeezed the tender fleshy folds. As Annette reached another climax, she leaned her head back and her whole body trembled pitifully.His manhood stuck between her legs wriggled and spewed out hot semen. Her soaked inner walls intermittently squeezed him tight. Now, Annette could not even groan and just helplessly shed tears. Her body was completely exhausted and she collapsed on Rafael\u2019s hard body.Rafael embraced the tiny woman and pressed a light kiss on her wet blond hair. The relationship was terribly satisfying, so therefore only the affection for the person with whom this pleasure was shared, remained in his heart. At this moment, Bavaria\u2019s arrogance, haughtiness and indifference were all erased from his mind.\u201cUgh, Rafael\u2026\u2026.\u201dAnnette, leaning against Rafael\u2019s hard chest, looked up at him with eyes dazed with desire. Just looking at her glazed eyes and wet eyelashes, his manhood rose again. Rafael clenched his teeth and laid her on the bed. This time, he intended to be at the top.\u201cRa, Rafael?\u201dAnnette, who realized that it wasn\u2019t over, looked scared. She was well aware of Rafael\u2019s stamina, but she didn\u2019t expect him to do it again.\u201d I think tonight\u2019s going to be a long night.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Having been tossed around by Raphael many times, she was sleeping like a log. Unlike Raphael who had sleep problems, Annette was the type who could fall asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.Stretching out his hand, Raphael habitually touched Annette\u2019s forehead and neck to check her temperature. Fortunately, there was no fever. It was difficult to check her right hand because of the bandage, but at least when he saw her exposed wrist, it only seemed to have a slight injury.Raphael regretted overworking Annette who had just woken up from her fever. He chastised himself for not controlling his desires. Knowing that she was a weak, little woman who couldn\u2019t be treated so roughly, he decided to be careful with her next time. Annette\u2019s eyes, which had become slightly sore from all the crying, made his chest ache in a strange way. As if a small thorn was stuck inside his heart.Raphael\u2019s deep blue eyes slowly skimmed over Annette\u2019s sleeping figure. Annette\u2019s sleeping posture was unusually straight. She slept peacefully with her hands in front of her chest. Even her little sleeping posture perfectly represented her exemplary disposition. Although he was a little irritated at seeing that, he still couldn\u2019t help but smile at her. Raphael was stunned when he realised he was smiling at her and soon hardened his face.\u201cFuck.\u201dIf he wanted to hold that woman and toss her as much as he wanted, it was normal to do so and leave without looking back. They were in a formal marriage anyway, and this was just sex without emotion. But why was he looking down at the face of this passed out woman and smiling like a madman?Raphael swept his hands down his face, and rubbed his eyes roughly until they became sore. However, he still found Annette\u2019s face pretty enough to want to swear. The faint tear marks left on her cheeks, her swollen lips, her blond hair scattered over her forehead and cheeks were all very pretty.\u2018What the hell am I doing?\u2019Raphael was very confused with himself. Even now, when he recalled the insulting remarks and actions of Annette\u2019s father, Allamand Bavaria, he couldn\u2019t help but clench his teeth in anger. The Duke of Bavaria, a vile pure-bred supremacist, and Raphael , an illegitimate child, were literally the worst match together. But why did he find that damn Allamand Bavaria\u2019s daughter so pretty? Feeling confused and ashamed, Raphael was suffering as he rubbed his forehead against the bed sheets. A muffled groan came out from his mouth.\u201cUmm.. Raphael?\u201dAt that moment, Annette, who was asleep, looked at Raphael with sleepy eyes. She couldn\u2019t open her eyes properly, so she struggled to turn towards Raphael. Then she reached out and stuttered, while stroking his bare shoulder.\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Raphael. You\u2019re safe now. No one will hurt you. I\u2019ll\u2026\u2026\u2026.. I\u2019ll protect you.\u201dAfter suffering from the arduous love affairs, her voice had become a little hoarse. Seeing her utter such strange words, Raphael looked at her with a frown, wondering what she was talking about. However, Annette, who was half-asleep, did not notice this. She was very drowsy, but she still tried to comfort Raphael.\u201cYou did nothing wrong\u2026 So don\u2019t suffer. The war is over, so\u2026 now relax and\u2026\u201dAnnette\u2019s voice eventually faded, unable to finish her words. Her small hand, patting Raphael\u2019s shoulder, eventually slipped onto the sheet. Raphael looked at Annette\u2019s face for a while. At first he was puzzled, not knowing what Annette was talking about, but soon he realized what she meant. She knew about his crappy illness.Raphael\u2019s eyes darkened. He thought she didn\u2019t have a clue. He remembered the time when Annette had fallen asleep in his room. And just a few days earlier, he had found himself in her bedroom. At this point, she would be a fool if she didn\u2019t know. She must have lied to save his pride. She knew he valued his pride and didn\u2019t like to show his weaknesses. So she simply closed her eyes and pretended to not know anything, to not get caught.\u201cHa.\u201dA dejected sigh came out of his mouth. Annette Bavaria found the weakness that he had been trying so hard to hide from others. \u2018That damn Bavarian woman.\u2019 In addition to this, after seeing his unconscious behavior while sleeping, it was clear that Annette pitied him.It was such a fucked up situation. At this point, the wounded pride made him see red, but it wasn\u2019t enough to blow his top. Infact, he felt less sleazy than he thought. Looking at Annette sleeping defenselessly next to him, he felt no urge to wring her slender neck to bury his secret forever. Ironically, Raphael felt very desperate.After removing his arm wrapped around her, Raphael got up and left his bedroom. Right now, his thoughts were very complicated, so he didn\u2019t want to see Annette\u2019s face. He thought he had a little trophy called Annette Bavaria, but in fact it was he who was struggling in her little grip.The shadow of the man in agony lingered in the hallway.\u2018It seems I would not be able to sleep easily tonight.\u2019* * *\u2018Even in my second life, the morning sun rose without faiI. And a new day has begun.\u2019Today Annette had no schedule. So, after lightly grooming herself, she was going to read a book in the living room under the sun. That was the only hobby that she could now do with her injured hand.At this time, she heard someone knock from the outside. Annette thought it was a maid who had come to brush her hair. So she told the person to come in without much thought. But it was a man, not a maid who had turned up. It was surprisingly Raphael.\u201cAre you busy today?\u201dRaphael, leaning obliquely against the door, asked with his arms folded in front of his chest. The posture looked just as bad as the market scoundrels, but his overly handsome face neutralised his overall meanness. \u2018Yesterday you couldn\u2019t even see my face, but today, all of a sudden, why would you show up and ask me that?\u2019 Annette, who became puzzled, shook her head, blinking her eyes.\u201cNo, nothing much. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cGood. If it\u2019s okay, go out with me.\u201dRaphael didn\u2019t reveal where they were going and gave such a notice out of the blue. Surprised by this, Annette looked at him with her eyes wide open. When his eyes met Annette\u2019s startled and curious eyes, Raphael felt his mouth become dry. He unwittingly added a little excuse.\u201cIt\u2019s not that far from here.\u201dAnnette, who was staring at Raphael for a moment, smiled brightly.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get ready now.\u201dEven though her hand was fractured because of Raphael, she couldn\u2019t neglect the fact that Raphael took great care of her while she was sick. So there was no reason to refuse his request to go out. Rather, it was a rare opportunity to go out with Raphael, so she was very excited. Naturally, Annette\u2019s smile brightened up even more.Seeing her dazzling smile, Raphael stood like a rock, completely dazed. Every time Annette laughed, she strangely seemed to glow. There\u2019s no way a person could glow, so he chastised himself for his stupid delusion.Raphael couldn\u2019t bear it and ran away. It would take Annette a little time to prepare anyway. In the meantime, he also needed to prepare his heart.* * *\u201cAren\u2019t you going to get up?\u201dAt the cold voice coming overhead, Annette opened her eyes. Seeing that the carriage had stopped, it seemed they had arrived at their destination. Annette realized she was dozing off against Raphael\u2019s shoulder. She thought Raphael\u2019s nature was not too bad, given that he had let her lean on his shoulder without pushing her awayEven though it was still daytime, it was dark outside. Because of this, Raphael\u2019s face, a little shaded, looked more dangerous and decadent than usual. Maybe because of his black hair, he looked just like a devil or an incubus who had come to steal Annette\u2019s soul. Annette holding his hand, got off the carriage and looked around.\u201cRaphael, where are we?\u201dLooking at the place, she didn\u2019t need an answer to know where it was. The vast expanse of pure white marbles in the distance captured Annette\u2019s gaze. Adding to this, the cold air and the stifling silence made the whole atmosphere more creepy and Annette couldn\u2019t help but shudder. The place where Raphael had brought her was the cemetery.The nobles usually had their own separate family cemetery, so it was the first time Annette had seen a public cemetery. It was obviously incomparable to a nobleman\u2019s cemetery, but it was still very well maintained than what she expected. So she thought it was a place for gentry without connections.\u201cWell, if I had known we were coming to the cemetery, I would have worn a black dress.\u201dAnnette smiled a little awkwardly. It was her first outing with her husband after her regression, but she never thought he would take her to the cemetery. She wasn\u2019t expecting a romantic date, but this was very unexpected. Annette looked down at the light blue dress she was wearing.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I didn\u2019t tell you in advance. So, how could you know?\u201dRaphael unexpectedly came up with a rational reply. In fact, he found it really annoying when people dressed up in black suits when coming to this place. Annette glanced at him and then looked around the quiet graveyard. But she didn\u2019t know why they came here.\u201cBut Raphael, what are we doing here\u2026?\u201dAnnette\u2019s eyes quivered as she asked this question thoughtlessly. Only she and Raphael had come here, but will only one person go back? Annette broke out in a cold sweat when she recalled the old ghost stories. Annette, who had already died once, suddenly found the cemetery very ominous.Raphael just shrugged and escorted her somewhere instead of answering. Looking at his expression, it seemed that he wasn\u2019t planning to bury Annette here. Annette gulped and followed him, somewhat nervous.\u201cHere it is.Raphael stopped in front of a tombstone. Compared to the other tombstones, it was a particularly large and luxurious tombstone. Annette squinted her eyes to read the name engraved on the tombstone. When she realised who it was, she was surprised.\u201cThis tombstone is\u2026.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Killed during the Letan Resistance Suppression Battle.Robert. It was the name that Raphael mumbled every time during his sleepwalking. In his nightmare, he begged Robert again and again for forgiveness. Perhaps the name engraved on this tombstone was also painfully engraved on Raphael\u2019s heart.Raphael did not look back at her. Raphael\u2019s side profile looking at the tombstone with both hands held together was so beautiful that it could not be considered human. As he stood there biting his lips, he looked like a god of death guarding the cemetery.\u201cYou know that, don\u2019t you? Every night I\u2026\u201dRaphael\u2019s face was distorted as if he was mentioning something very disgusting. Though he did not finish what he was saying, Annete understood his omitted words. Raphael, who was a very prideful man, was disgusted with his weakness and could not accept it.Annette reached out and affectionately wrapped her hand around the back of his hand. It was an act she did subconsciously because she couldn\u2019t bear Raphael looking so haggard. Fortunately, Raphael didn\u2019t open his mouth. He only glanced down at her hand and surprisingly didn\u2019t shake it off.\u201cWhat kind of person was he?\u201dAnnette asked quietly to calm Raphael\u2019s emotions a little. Raphael swallowed hard, and then with great difficulty opened his mouth.\u201cMy aide-de-camp. He was the only one who stayed behind. But in the battle, while we were suppressing Letan\u2019s forces\u2026. he couldn\u2019t come back alive. He stumbled and fell into the moat. Because of that, he broke his legs. The enemies just kept coming, but Robert, with his broken leg, could not climb up the moat. If I had also stayed behind, we both would have died.\u201dRaphael stopped speaking and clenched both of his fists hard. Perhaps Raphael struggled until the end and was forced to retreat, leaving Robert behind. And that guilt still tormented him everyday. Because of this, he had nightmares of Robert dying every night.Annette felt sorry for such a Raphael. In such a situation, if she had left her sister-in-law, Claire behind and retreated, she too would have felt guilty all her life. Instead of consoling him through words, she just grasped his hand more tightly.Raphael didn\u2019t say anything after that. Instead, he simply reached out, brushed the dirt off from Robert\u2019s tombstone, and ripped off the moss that grew between the engraved name. The action was a little rough, but it still had a warm feeling.Annette, who looked at this from the side, smiled a little. Then she suddenly became curious.\u2018In my past life after I died, did Raphael also come to my grave\u2026 would he have also taken care of my grave like this?\u2019Annette felt dazed just by imagining it. Standing alone in front of her tombstone, dressed in a black suit, what kind of facial expression would Raphael have? Was he happy, thinking his sick and annoying wife finally disappeared? Or was he alone and lonely like this?It was a mystery for her now. Annette never wanted to die because of stress again. And for that, she had to leave Raphael. Whenever she saw him hating her, Annette\u2019s heart ached.\u2018But unlike before, this time he told me about Robert.\u2019This was the first time Raphael had told her about Robert. In her previous life, she knew nothing because she had never been close with him. Not only that, she only now learned that Raphael was suffering from trauma after the war, and he had a painful thorn in his heart named Robert.But this time, Annette didn\u2019t ask, but Raphael voluntarily told her first. Annette felt the need to think about this a little. Did Raphael really hate her that much? A little hope shone in Annette\u2019s heart.\u201cUmm, Raphael.\u201dAnnette wasn\u2019t the type who could guess what was going in others\u2019 minds and behave accordingly. She believed if one had any questions, the best way was to ask the other person directly. Even though she might get hurt again by hearing the words \u2018I hate you\u2019 like last time, she was now quite closer to the truth. Annette cleared her throat and straightened her back. She then looked up at Raphael and asked.\u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201dRaphael looked back at her with dark eyes. His red lips, set in his white chin, were strikingly beautiful.\u201cBecause you know my secret.\u201d\u201cIs that all?\u201d\u201cThen, should there be another reason?\u201dThe small hope that had blossomed in her heart immediately withered away. She really didn\u2019t expect him to say something like \u2018I don\u2019t hate you like before.\u2018 But, his cold clipped tone sounded like not to expect anything more. This alone was disappointing enough, but Raphael didn\u2019t just stop there. He bowed his head, then, clutched Annette\u2019s shoulder tightly and whispered into her ear.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about saying a word about this to others. You better stay still.\u201dRaphael\u2019s deep blue eyes looking at her were very fierce. Annette understood he only shared his secret because he had to, not because he wanted to confide or have any emotional exchange with Annette. Seeing this, Annette swallowed a sigh and decided to stay quiet. It seemed like it would be better to visit the smuggling guild again soon.After leaving the cemetery, Annette remained silent. She was blankly staring out of a small window in the carriage. The golden eyelashes, which were slightly lowered, were weakly quivering, and the pink lips under her small nose, were tightly closed. Seeing this, Raphael felt strangely stuffy in his chest.\u2018Are you offended?\u2019Raphael was used to Annette\u2019s attitude of always smiling at him and talking to him about this and that. And on top of that, after nursing her, he felt a little affection for her, whether he liked it or not. So, he brought Annette to Robert\u2019s graveyard.However, because of his distorted nature, he doubted Annette and was quite wary of her. Raphael had a lot of enemies. But if Annette told someone about his weaknesses\u2026 It was just too horrible to even imagine.It would have been nice if he had had enough time to telI Annette his secrets. However, Raphael came unprepared and shared the secret as if he did so only because he was caught. In a word, what happened was really the worst. Because of this, Annette shut her mouth a little more tightly than what he intended.\u2018I should have said it softer.\u2018Raphael unknowingly frowned and regretted his actions. For an illegitimate child like him, there was only one way for him to survive in the aristocratic society. And that was to raise his head more haughtily, even if someone pointed their fingers at him, and bite those who slandered him ferociously like a beast.A man who was surrounded by enemies on all sides had no choice but to be wary and sensitive about everything. The same was also true for Raphael. The aggressive speech that he used to protect himself could not be changed easily. He believed he would live his life alone anyway, so he never regretted it. But this time\u2026.. he really regretted it.\u201cAnnette.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnnette turned her head on hearing Raphael call her. As their eyes met, a habitual elegant smile appeared on Annette\u2019s face. But her pink eyes weren\u2019t smiling at all.Raphael\u2019s heart sank when he saw it. Strangely, Annette, who was sitting right next to him, felt very far away. It seemed as if she was about to open the carriage door and go somewhere far away. Well, in fact, Raphael\u2019s intuition was very accurate. Annette was wondering when to visit the secret guild \u2018Secret\u2019 again.Raphael was a man whose disposition was as close to that of a noble beast. Naturally, his instincts were very sharp and now they insisted him to do something. Raphael, in his anxiety, unknowingly made an impulsive offer.\u201cAnnette, if it\u2019s okay, let\u2019s have dinner around here. What do you say?\u201d\u201c\u2026.Here?\u201dAnnette\u2019s eyes, intrigued, became a little energetic. They were now near a town that was quite far away from the mansion. Of course, for Annette, who had lived all her life like a flower in the greenhouse, it was a novel place. Having lived only on the Bavarian street, she had never been to a restaurant on a street like this.\u201cOkay.\u201dAnyway, in order to move to Osland and start a new life, it was necessary to get used to the life of the common people. After getting Annette\u2019s consent, Raphael poked his head out of the window and ordered the coachman to do something. Then, about 10 minutes later, the carriage stopped in front of a busy street.First, Raphael got off from the carriage, and with great care, opened the door and held Annette\u2019s hand. It was a kind and caring gesture. However, Annette, who was very excited on seeing the exotic scenery of the busy streets, did not notice it.\u201cOh my goodness! This is my first time in a place like this.\u201dThis town was far different from the high-end shopping district. So Raphael was a little worried because it was not a place suitable for Annette who had high eyes. It was a place that received gentry and rich merchants as main customers. Fortunately, Annette seemed very interested, so Raphael coughed and pointed his finger somewhere.\u201cAs far as I know, everything from this street to that street are all restaurants. Take a look around and pick a place you like.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 can I choose?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dRaphael answered lightly. After all it was nothing for him. At that moment, Annette smiled brightly. The smile that couldn\u2019t hide her excitement was so beautiful that it was something beyond describable. Seeing this, Raphael couldn\u2019t breathe properly and felt as if he had been hit hard.\u2018Why is she smiling like that?\u2019It was a beautiful smile as if flowers were blooming right before his eyes. Raphael didn\u2019t know, but Annette had rarely herself taken any decision in her life. Her father, Allamand, was an extremely aristocratic and conservative figure. He was a tyrant who controlled everything under him. And Annette was also considered as one of his possessions.Because of this, Annette\u2019s previous life was extremely passive. But she didn\u2019t want to live like that in this life. In the meantime, the choice that Raphael offered her, really made her very happy. Annette looked at the numerous restaurants in front of her and with an excited gait, contemplated where to go.\u201cLet\u2019s go this way.\u201dAnnette, with a big smile, stepped forward, forgetting all her earlier sorrows. She didn\u2019t even realise that Raphael was standing still, completely dazed, while looking at her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He expected Annette to choose a restaurant with a luxurious and elegant atmosphere just like the restaurants she usually went to. However Raphael\u2019s expectations were brutally shattered.\u201cOh, my God, Raphael! Look at that pig. It\u2019s really big!\u201dAnnette chose an open-air restaurant. There, a huge pig was being roasted on the iron skewers with a sizzling sound. It looked really well cooked. Even the apple stuffed in the pig\u2019s open mouth looked very delicious and smooth. Annette, who had only eaten perfectly cooked cut pieces of meat, unexpectedly lit up with excitement on seeing the pig roast.\u201cIt smells really good. Black pepper, basil, cumin\u2026 and hmm..what else did you put in? Oh my God, look at that gloss!\u201dThe chef became excited when a pretty looking noble lady looked at him with high hopes. At first, he was worried that the two people with dazzling looks and dressed up in luxurious clothes had come to make trouble. But they were unexpectedly quiet, and also ordered the most expensive dish from the menu! For these distinguished guests, he was willing to give the services that he generally would not be willing to do.\u201cLook, the pig is cooked very well! I\u2019ll cut it for you in a special way.\u201dThe chef, with a terrifying saw and bone knife in both hands, began to carefully cut the pig. With exaggerated movements, he swung the blade in a large trajectory. Seeing all this along with a wide-eyed look, anyone could tell that the focus was on showmanship rather than practicality. In particular, Raphael, a seasoned swordsman, found all these exaggerated gimmicks absurd.\u201cOh, that\u2019s amazing. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my life!\u201dBut Annette was very excited and happy on seeing this and she even clapped her hands in her excitement. Then, she flinched a little in pain and looked down at the bandage on her right hand that she had forgotten. Raphael was dumbstruck seeing the always elegant Annette be this excited for the first time. Her cheeks were flushed red, and her eyes sparkled like stars.\u201cAnnette, come here and sit properly.\u201dRaphael did not want to say something like this to a grown adult. Especially if the said person was a woman like Annette Bavaria who always seemed elegant since childhood. However, it was the first time he had seen Annette look so excited, so he was worried that she would make a mistake.When she was about to graze her injured right hand against the table, Raphael couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and grabbed her elbow to support her. As a result,the napkin tucked into her neckline fell over.\u2018Why the hell am I doing this?\u2019\u201cCome on, try it! It\u2019s the best masterpiece in our restaurant!\u201dFinally, the chef, who had finished cutting the roast, came towards them, wiping his sweat. He was kind enough to cut it into small parts on the plate to make it easier to eat. Surprisingly, all the cooking utensils and tableware used in the restaurant were made of iron, which made the whole experience of dining in the common restaurant more realistic.The new thrilling experience lifted both Annette\u2019s mood and appetite. The steaming pig roast smelled really nice. Annette, who was more excited than ever, eagerly picked up her fork.\u201cWait, Annette.\u201dRaphael frowned and reached out to stop her. If the freshly roasted pig meat was eaten directly, it would have burnt her mouth. Even though the chef took special care of the meat and cut it into pieces, the pieces were still pretty big. Raphael glanced at her right hand wrapped in bandage. Even if he doubted whether he was the cause of her injury, Raphael couldn\u2019t help but be worried about her injured hand.Raphael raised the knife and while furrowing his eyebrows, cut the meat into very small pieces for Annette. When he saw himself doing what others did to impress their female companions, he felt really ridiculous. He never expected he would do something like this for a woman. Raphael put the knife down and coldly pushed the plate back.\u201cHere, eat after it cools down.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAnnette picked the pig rind with her fork and put it into her mouth in anticipation. And the result\u2026 totally exceeded her expectations! The pork rind with spicy sauce was very crunchy. The thick flesh beneath it melted in her mouth, filling it with salty juices. Because of the cool breeze blowing outside, it tasted even more amazing.\u201cIt\u2019s really delicious.\u201dAnnette said, covering her mouth with one hand. She was really moved. Raphael, who was looking at her from the opposite side, smiled. When she saw his handsome face smile without malice for the first time, her heart strangely started beating violently. So Annette, to hide her flustered state, recommended the dish to him.\u201cTry it, Raphael. Come on.\u201dAnnette\u2019s fork in the air was shaking unstably. The fork, forcibly held between the thickly bandaged fingers, was about to fall off. Seeing this, Raphael shook his head and cut the meat into more smaller pieces. At this point, the pig roast was almost reduced into mashed meat.After almost crushing the meat, Raphael reached out and took the fork from her. Then, after swallowing the meat hanging at the fork\u2019s end, he placed a spoon in Annette\u2019s hand.\u201cJust eat with a spoon. It\u2019s not even a formal restaurant anyway, so nobody would say anything.\u201dAnnette had been subjected to rigorous training to become the Crown Princess. Of course, table manners were also included in it. But eating mashed meat with a spoon\u2026 it was something that she could never imagine to do.\u2018But\u2026.there\u2019s no reason not to, right?\u2019Someone whispered from inside the newly born Annette. Annette looked at the spoon for a moment, and then scooped up a lot of mashed meat and pushed it straight into her mouth. The meat that Raphael chopped up was still delicious and fragrant, but it was now much easier to chew than before. Annette was enchanted by the greasy and salty taste that filled her mouth.\u201cTry this, too. It doesn\u2019t taste bad.\u201dRaphael lifted the glass that he was sipping and pushed it towards Annette. It was a sweet and sour liquor with lemon and apple added to white wine. When she took a sip, the refreshing taste washed away the salty and greasy aftertaste of the meat. The cool night breeze blowing near the river was also very pleasant. In a word, it was a night that made people get drunk.Most of all, what pleased Annette was Raphael\u2019s face looking at her from across. His beautiful face, under the warm lighting, was much warmer than usual. In her previous short life, Annette had barely seen him like this.\u2018Seeing you like this, it feels like we\u2019ve become a little familiar.\u2019Perhaps because of seeing him cut the meat up for her, Annette somehow forgot her earlier sadness. Everything would be solved when she would leave anyway, so there was no need to make an impression on him. But before saying goodbye to Raphael, she was satisfied to share a memory with him, that she could look back at, with a smile.Annette smiled and tilted her glass. Unlike her appearance, she could hold her alcohol very well. Thanks to this, she was able to walk pretty well even after drinking three glasses of wine in a row. Raphael, who looked more relaxed than before, said in a jovial voice.\u201cIt turned out to be real drinks. If you had drunk more there, by now your blood vessels would have been filled with wine instead of blood.\u201d\u201cI can still have one or more drinks. It\u2019s a pity that the restaurant closed earlier than I expected.\u201dOn the way back to the carriage, Annette regretted not being able to drink more. She didn\u2019t usually enjoy alcohol very much, but she wasn\u2019t a weak drinker. She wanted to drink as much as she could because of its sweet and sour taste. Raphael, who was listening to her boisterous remarks, eventually laughed out loud. But he didn\u2019t notice his own strange behavior, and even teased Annette.\u201cNo way, no more after this. Would it be good for a Lady\u2019s honor to be carried piggyback? Now you wouldn\u2019t want to go back home like that, would you?\u201dRaphael\u2019s eyes, which always looked at her sharply, were curved, and his blue eyes sparkled under his long eyelashes. Annette smiled and looked at him warmly. It was a very pleasant but short night. As their carriage got closer, Annette became a little sad. Now, they would go back to their usual selves after this short ride.\u201cOh, by any chance,\u2026.is it Lady Annette?\u201dAt this time, someone walking from the other side came towards them. Annette, who was smiling at RafaeI, turned her head. Just as she saw who the person was, the pleasant smile completely disappeared from her face. It was someone very familiar to Annette.\u201cMiss Diana. It\u2019s quite an unexpected meeting.\u201dThe name of the woman with black curly hair was Diana McClaire. Diana, the second daughter of Count McClaire, famous for his multifaceted business, was once Annette\u2019s childhood friend. Even though there has been no exchange between them since childhood, one\u2019s childhood friends always remained in their memories. Thanks to this, Annette could quickly recall Diana\u2019s name even after five years.\u201cYou know it\u2019s dangerous to roam outside at this late hour!.. Ah! You were with your husband. Hello, Your Excellency, Marquis of Carnesis? I\u2019m Diana McClaire, daughter of Count McClaire.\u201dDiana slightly lifted the hem of her skirt and greeted Raphael. It was a rather natural polite greeting, but her cheeks, as she glanced sideways at Raphael, were slightly red. Raphael, who had a bigger and sturdier physique than others, was a very attractive man. He not only looked handsome, but his violent and arrogant temperament also added to his charm.Annette looked at Diana with a subtle frown. She wasn\u2019t a bad person, but she had two problems. The first problem was that Diana was the type that fell in love too quickly. Even now, Diana\u2019s face, looking at her husband, seemed to be full of admiration.Well, actually that was okay. Diana just would fall in love quickly, but she would never lose her common sense. Even if she fell in love with a man who was already taken, she would never do anything more. That\u2019s why Annette could ignore the slight blush on Diana\u2019s cheek.However, she couldn\u2019t ignore Diana\u2019s other problem. It was not really much of a problem, but at least for Annette, it was quite a big problem. Because Diana McClaire\u2026.\u201cOh, come to think of it, Lady Annette. No, you are Marchioness of Carnesis now! Did you hear that? Well my friend Celestine has received two boxes of wedding gifts from the royal family! After all, being a Crown Princess must be amazing, isn\u2019t it?\u201dIt was because Diana McClaire was one of Celestine Keers\u2019 best friends.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Diana stood in front of her, with an eager face, as if waiting for her response. She was well aware that Annette was once a very strong candidate for Crown Princess. Nevertheless, bringing up that story by mentioning Celestine could only be explained as sheer malice.\u2018If she would have said this before my regression, I sure would have got hurt.\u2019Annette shrugged inwardly and looked at Diana. She used to be her childhood friend, but now she was Celestine\u2019s best friend. The human relationships were really ironic.Fortunately, Annette could now laugh it off casually. It was something that happened five years ago, so she didn\u2019t get hurt because of it anymore. Unless Celestine, who she suspected to be the mastermind behind her framed charges, came in front of her, she could easily laugh it off. So Annette smiled and retorted.\u201cOh, really? That\u2019s amazing. Is there any blue diamond tiara among the gifts that Lady Celestine received? I really want to see it in person, at least once. I hope she uses it for her coronation ceremony.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know.\u201dAnnette really seemed purely curious about the tiara. Seeing Diana tremble with a face having the expression of \u2018It\u2019s not like that.\u2019, Annette ambushed her and affectionately put her hands together on Raphael\u2019s arms. Looking up at him, she tilted her head and said affectionately.\u201cHoney, I think I\u2019d rather have a blue diamond. What do you think? Will it look good on me?\u201dRaphael looked down at her silently. Seeing him not respond, Annette broke out in a cold sweat. She thought he would be on her side because they had a good time together just now. She wondered if she got too ahead of herself. She thought it would be sad if she got embarrassed in front of Diana.Just then, Raphael pulled out his arm and removed Annette\u2019s folded arms around him. As expected, he had no intention of getting involved in this troublesome altercation between two women. Annette bit her lips, feeling her heart sink. At that moment, Raphael gently hugged her shoulder.\u201cIf you want a blue diamond\u2026\u2026. feel free to buy whatever you want. As long as you\u2019re happy, you can even empty the safe.\u201dHearing the low and deep voice, Diana exclaimed, \u201cOh my!\u201d and quickly covered her mouth. It was a strange and wonderful feeling to see a man be so affectionate to his wife. But Raphael didn\u2019t just stop there. He lowered his head and gently caressed Annette\u2019s face.\u201cBut I think pink diamonds would be better. It would look better with your pretty pink eyes.\u201dAfter speaking, Raphael smiled and brushed his lips against Annette\u2019s eyelid. The tender, affectionate gesture could melt the heart of the beholders. Thanks to Raphael\u2019s active cooperation, Annette gained more courage.\u201cThank you, Raphael. Marrying you was the best choice of my life.\u201dA woman who had never had a choice since she was born, laughed like a flower and lied. Both the speaker and the listener knew it was a lie. But Diana McClaire didn\u2019t know this. As Celestine\u2019s best friend, she just wanted to poke fun at Annette, but in the end it was she who became a joke.\u201cThen, Lady McClaire, it\u2019s too late. We have to go now. Will you be okay with being all alone?\u201dAnnette, hugging Raphael\u2019s waist, smiled and took a jab at Diana, who had no fiance yet. Diana was a person who easily fell in love with someone, but unfortunately, the person with whom she fell in love never responded back to her. Due to this, she had never been embroiled in a scandal where she was linked with someone. Diana, who had been stabbed in her sore spot, raised her voice in a fit of rage.\u201cOf course, I would be okay! All of this area is a commercial district that is managed by my family. Do you know how popular iron tools are these days? Thanks to that, the business is going so well that I was just on my way home, after working until late at night!!\u201d\u201cOh, I see. I\u2019m really jealous of that.\u201dAnnette, who was from the richest family in Deltium, laughed leisurely. In response, Diana clenched her fists and trembled in anger. In addition, Raphael also joined her in the fun, which was like an icing on the cake.\u201cCome to think of it, among the things I was given, there was also an iron ore mine. Somehow, the income from there these days is quite good. Annette, if you want, I\u2019ll put it in your name. Whether it\u2019s blue or pink, buy all the diamonds you want.\u201dIt\u2019s amazing, really! Diana opened her mouth wide. Nowadays, with the knowledge of how to use the iron ore, it was quite a fad to use iron materials. Because of this, the nobles with iron ore mines and mining rights were having quite fun these days. But you want to give it whole to Annette? At that moment Diana felt humiliated and was very jealous of Annette.Originally, iron was a material that was not well used because it was difficult to remove carbon from the cast iron. However, with new methods being discovered recently, ironware had become enormously popular in everyday life. From the iron tableware that Annette saw at the restaurant, it seemed that they had also jumped on this trend.\u2018Iron can make money\u2026.. that\u2019s interesting.\u2019Annette blinked and was in a state of awe. She decided to learn more about Raphael\u2019s iron ore mine. Of course, it wasn\u2019t because she coveted his iron ore mine. Annette speculated that her father might be after Raphael\u2019s iron ore mine.Annette, who was lost in her thoughts, was lovingly embraced by Raphael. He then kissed her little head. With a flushed face, Annette said goodbye to Diana, who was enviously looking at them.\u201cThen Lady McClaire. My wife is tired, so we\u2019ll take our leave. Please excuse us.\u201dDiana turned around in humiliation and looked at the backs of the man and the woman. Just like the loving couples in the pictures, they hugged each other\u2019s shoulders and waist and headed for the carriage together. In particular, the appearance of Raphael with a sturdy built, bowing down towards the slender Annette was a scene that made even the viewers blush.\u2018You\u2019ll see, I\u2019ll also get into a relationship this year!\u2019With a firm resolution in her mind, Diana turned around. At that moment, her eyes teared up as she thought that she could never be completely happy, even if the ironware business of her family went well. If the iron sells well, Raphael\u2019s iron ore mine will also become profitable, and he would buy Annette a lot of diamonds with that money.Diana was so envious that she shed tears in her heart. Even if Annette couldn\u2019t become the Crown Princess, it didn\u2019t really matter. She now had such a hot and loving husband! At that moment, she envied Annette ten times more than Celestine. For her, seeing Annette walk affectionately with her husband was more hurtful than seeing Celestine receiving wedding gifts from the royal family.Meanwhile, Annette, riding in the carriage after leaving Diana, breathed a sigh of relief. She carefully opened her mouth, blushing with shame.\u201cThat \u2026. Thank you very much for that, Raphael\u2026. For being on my side.\u201dWhen Annette expressed her heartfelt gratitude, Raphael felt awkward for no reason. He actually started to hate Diana, who was acting like a fox. Although seeing that her husband was standing next to her, she still indirectly asked Annette, \u2018Isn\u2019t it sad that you couldn\u2019t marry another man?\u2019 It felt as if someone was pricking his body with thousands of needles. So he wanted to prove that Annette\u2019s marriage with him was not something to be disappointed about. That was all.However, he couldn\u2019t be honest about this childish feeling. In the first place, Raphael was a very stubborn man, so he always spoke very frankly. Because of this, he replied bluntly to Annette\u2019s \u2018thank you\u2019.\u201cIf you\u2019re grateful, just make sure your hand gets well soon.\u201dHe didn\u2019t remember how Annette\u2019s hand got injured, but he knew it was probably his fault. Whenever Raphael saw her bandaged hand, he felt uncomfortable. He thought it would have been better, if it was his hand that had gotten injured.\u201cI\u2019ll get better soon. Thank you for today.\u201dAnnette replied with an idiotic smile. Though they encountered a little bump in the middle, her first outing with Raphael was much better than what she expected. She not only went to Robert\u2019s cemetery, which she didn\u2019t even know about in her previous life, but also dined with Raphael and drank alcohol. Although she hated Diana\u2019s interruption, she was able to deal with her, thanks to Raphael\u2019s help.\u2018Come to think of it, Miss Diana\u2026 She didn\u2019t seem to know anything about my false charges.\u2019Annette recalled Diana\u2019s expression and tone as she looked at her. If she had known about Annette\u2019s false charges, she would have taunted her with it right away. Considering how Diana was Celestine\u2019s best friend, she was surprised by how perfect Bavaria\u2019s \u2018silencing of the matter\u2019 was. Although Annette didn\u2019t like her family very much, she felt comfortable because of it.While Annette was lost in thought, the carriage quietly headed home. The town they stopped by was not much far away, so they soon arrived at the mansion. Before entering her room, Annette turned towards Raphael in the hallway.\u201cGood night, Raphael. I really enjoyed going out with you.\u201dRaphael nodded without much response. Annette was actually now much more familiar with Raphael\u2019s blunt responses. As soon as she turned around, Raphael\u2019s low voice came from behind.\u201cAnnette.\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201dAs she turned her head, she saw Raphael standing stiffly in the dark corridor, looking up at her. Raphael\u2019s white face, which did not get tanned even after all the rigorous training in the sun, was as immaculate as a marble sculpture. His red lips hesitated for a while. And soon Annette was asked a question that she had never expected.\u201cThat.. What you said\u2026.Was it true?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cThat, you don\u2019t regret\u2026\u2026.\u201dRaphael couldn\u2019t directly ask her, \u201cWas marrying me really the best option?\u201d Annette, who had never thought he would ask such a question, opened her eyes wide.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was worried about what Annette would say to his question. But Annette unexpectedly didn\u2019t take the question seriously.\u2018Maybe he\u2019s asking if I regret this marriage?\u2019Annette realised what he was asking. In her previous life, Raphael had kept his promise until the end. Though she was helpless and was suffering from the ugly illness, he never looked at her in disgust. Until the day she died, he stayed by her side and no matter how bad her illness became, he never turned his back on her. Such a man was truly rare in this world. Annette, remembering this, replied gently with a smile.\u201cYes. Even though this may be disrespectful towards the royal family, I\u2019d rather marry you than be some princess.\u201dIt was really strange. Annette, who had said something so embarrassing, was calm, but Raphael\u2019s face turned beet red when he heard it. He was embarrassed because it was his first time blushing in front of a woman. It was so sweet to hear her say that she would rather marry him than be a princess.Raphael was only the king\u2019s illegitimate child. And the Deltium\u2019s aristocratic society tended to value lineage. Because of this, Raphael was often ridiculed by other nobles. In contrast, Raphael\u2019s half brother, Ludwig, was the only noble crown prince. Under these circumstances, Raphael had a strong inferiority complex about his birth. This was why he was particularly hard on Annette, who married someone like him.For a woman who was desperately aiming to be the Crown Princess and could even bring down her other competitors, this marriage would only be a death sentence. She would never put the marriage in her eyes. Instead of the treasure she really wanted, she ended up with trash! Raphael was too proud to be treated like that by a woman. So he wanted to give up on this marriage before Annette could. Raphael\u2019s cold attitude at the beginning of their marriage was a result of this sentiment.\u2018But is it truly better to marry me than the prince\u2026.. do you really like it?\u2019He knew it was too shallow of him to think like this, but her words had a profound effect on Raphael. Raphael turned his back, trying to control the corners of his mouth, which were continuously trying to soar up. He was worried that she might see his red face even in the dark hallway.Annette, who was unaware of the big tremors she had caused in Raphael\u2019s heart, simply thought he was going to bed. Since she had accompanied him to Robert\u2019s grave for a long time, she hoped that Raphael could now sleep comfortably. With great sincerity, Annette warmly said good night to Raphael.\u201cGood night, Raphael.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Annette.\u201dJust as Annette was about to turn her back, Raphael suddenly called her from behind. Annette looked at him, tilting her head a little and waited for him to speak. However, Raphael hesitated, unable to speak out any word, and simply gazed at the floor, struggling to keep his mouth shut.\u201cThat.. Sometimes\u2026.. Can I come to your bedroom?\u201dAnnette laughed at the unexpected question. One of the drawbacks of Raphael was that he mostly came into her bedroom by slamming the door open. He rarely knocked, let alone ask for Annette\u2019s permission. However, Raphael, who was standing stiffly in the hallway, staring at the floor without making eye contact, seemed quite sincere.\u2018He even looks a little cute.\u2019It was really surprising to see Raphael look this cute. Before her regression, he was such a scary and violent man. Because of this, Annette was in a strange mood and could not speak for a while. Misunderstanding her silence for rejection, Raphael added with a more anxious tone than before.\u201cYou know I can\u2019t sleep well.\u201dAt that, Annette felt her feet become numb. It sounded like he knew he could sleep well when he was with her, but could it be possible that Raphael had noticed her \u2018ability\u2018? She didn\u2019t want anyone to know about her regression. Annette, hiding her surprised heart, asked as if she was really curious.\u201cDo you feel better when you sleep with me?\u201d\u201cA lot.\u201dRaphael responded with a firm tone and looked straight at her. The blue eyes shining under the long, dark eyelashes seemed sincere. Somehow, when she faced his intense gaze, Annette\u2019s cheeks slightly flushed with shame. Seeing this, it seemed like he really wanted her. Even if it was because of sleep.So Annette lowered her eyelashes and nodded. They were a couple anyway. Raphael, who finally got her consent, beamed a dazzling smile.\u201cThank you.\u201dFor the first time, Raphael said \u2018thank you\u2018 to her. As soon as Annette heard it, she realised that everything was really different from before. A warm and friendly atmosphere covered the two people who stood in the dark hallway, turning their backs to each other\u2019s bedrooms. It was too surreal that it felt like a pleasant dream.___Annette opened her eyes in a hazy mood. She could see the side face of the handsome man in front of her. The man with a straight forehead, sharp nose, and red lips looked surprisingly beautiful. However, the stiff neck, broad shoulders, and muscular torso exuded wild masculinity.Annette, half asleep, looked at the unrealistic side face of Raphael. Only then did last night\u2019s events vaguely come to her mind.\u2018Oh, he slept here again last night.\u2019To put it up nicely, Raphael was like a skilled assassin, but to be honest, to her he was like a night thief. Whenever he couldn\u2019t sleep, he silently sneaked into Annette\u2019s bedroom, without letting a mouse or a bird know. Unfortunately, Annette was the type of person who would fall asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. So she didn\u2019t even know when he would sneak into her room. Because of this, she would be startled to find Raphael in her bed every morning.But like last night, there were times when she noticed in advance that Raphael had come. It usually happened whenever his sleepwalking was triggered. Every time Annette woke up, she would hold Raphael\u2019s hand and bring him to bed. And then she would use her ability to put him to sleep. Thanks to this, her lullaby skills were improving day by day.Annette held back the yawn that threatened to spill out. She carefully raised her upper body and examined the face of Raphael, who was sleeping peacefully. She was a little worried last night because he was again sleepwalking, but fortunately Raphael now, seemed to be sleeping well. There was no shade under his eyes, and his complexion also looked good. Looking at his figure sleeping deeply and taking steady breaths, she thought he looked just as beautiful and strong as the god of war.\u2018Let him sleep more.\u2019Annette felt sorry for Raphael, who could hardly fall asleep. So if possible, she wanted to make sure he could sleep as long as possible. She very silently came down from the bed so as not to wake him up. But then, a thought came to her mind.\u2018What if he catches a cold while sleeping like that?\u2019Raphael preferred to keep his torso bare, while sleeping at night. Even now, his sturdy, tanned upper body was half exposed under the blanket. Of course the scenery was very pleasing to the eye, but it seemed not very good for Raphael\u2019s health.Annette, who was worried, carefully pulled up the blanket and covered him up to his neck. Even the fingers that were exposed out of the blanket were carefully pulled in and covered under the blanket. Then, the sensitive Raphael frowned and showed signs of waking up. Annette patted him gently on the shoulder unknowingly, just like a mother soothing her child.\u201cCome on, baby, sleep.\u201dOnce she said it out, Annette wanted to bite her tongue off. What do you mean by \u2018come on baby, sleep\u2019? How embarrassing would it be if Raphael woke up and looked at her with a ridiculous expression?Fortunately, Raphael did not wake up. He just turned his head a little and then again fell back into a deep sleep. Annette, who had been frozen on the spot, sighed in relief. Lifting up her heels, she did her best to quietly sneak out of the bedroom. She hoped Raphael could continue sleeping deeply.Click-Unfortunately, Annette\u2019s wish did not come true. Even though the sound of the door closing was very small, it was still picked up by Raphael\u2019s sharp ears. Raphael was actually awake when Annette woke up. He just pretended to fall asleep because he was embarrassed to face Annette.\u2018You don\u2019t think I\u2019m coming too often, right?\u2019Raphael was inwardly bothered by that part. How much would his pride get hurt if he ran into Annette in the morning and get caught by her? If it had been his normal self, he would have stopped coming, even if he didn\u2019t want to worry about such nasty things. But, the sleep in Annette\u2019s bedroom was too sweet. He wondered why he could sleep so well here.Well, given Annette\u2019s personality, it didn\u2019t seem she would kick him out. She wasn\u2019t the type to go back on her words. Raphael laughed unconsciously, recalling what she had said earlier.\u2018Come on baby, sleep\u2019It was not something that would come out of Annette\u2019s mouth, who always seemed calm and clever. Raphael actually got nervous when she was staring at him. If she had woken him up and told him to leave right away, something inside him would have surely fallen apart. He didn\u2019t know if it would be his pride or what.But Annette unexpectedly pulled the blanket over him and patted his shoulder. The touch of the small, light hand seemed to pat on his heart, not his shoulder. As he recalled the moment, Raphael somehow felt a queer feeling as if his heart was tightening. He frowned and rubbed his aching chest, not knowing why he was doing this.\u2018Anyway, this isn\u2019t bad either.\u2019Maybe this is what marriage is. Raphael who thought this in his heart, sighed and rose satisfactorily, like a lion who had just woken up. As he stretched out his arms and legs, he noticed that his body\u2019s vitality had improved. He only slept well for a few days, but was surprised by the unexpected result.So he couldn\u2019t stop sneaking into Annette\u2019s bedroom. Raphael was sure that today would be a pleasant day. He thought it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to have dinner with Annette after his sword training. After all that was something that couples did.\u201cWhat? Annette has gone out?\u201dUnfortunately, Raphael\u2019s good mood only lasted for a day. After finishing his sword training, Raphael, who had hurried back, now felt very uncomfortable. The maid was terrified when Raphael asked this with a crooked face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She tried to tell her master about Annette\u2019s whereabouts.\u201cYes. She went out somewhat\u2026 around two hours ago.\u201dWhere could she have gone now? Are there any places where she would go around here? Raphael was displeased with the fact that Annette was not at home. It wasn\u2019t good for a small, slender woman like her to wander around this time. Does she know even what could happen to her? Like the last time, someone like the Crown Prince may appear and try to get close to her with the pretense of saying goodbye, or a crazy bitch like Diana Mcclaire could pretend to be close with her, only try to embarrass her by bringing up how she couldn\u2019t become the crown princess.Raphael frowned, recalling all the dangers present outside the mansion. Because of this, the maid\u2019s complexion became more pale. However, Raphael wasn\u2019t interested in the maid\u2019s reaction and asked casually.\u201cIs it somewhere around here?\u201d\u201cYes, I think so. Perhaps a maid named Mary knows Madam\u2019s destination. May I call her now, Master?\u201dThe maid who somehow wanted to escape from Raphael\u2019s interrogation said earnestly. Raphael wasn\u2019t really going to look into it or anything, but the maid\u2019s suggestion didn\u2019t seem bad. It was not that he wanted to imprison Annette inside the house or something, he was just worried about her, so he was just trying to find out where she had gone.\u201cOkay. Bring her to me.\u201dThinking like this, Raphael nodded his head. Then the maid quickly disappeared to go and find Mary. Looking at her quick action, Raphael felt satisfied as an employer. Becoming an aristocrat was the most satisfying reward he ever had. It was because of this he was also able to marry Annette Bavaria.\u201cWait, why would I think like this\u2026.?\u201dHe found his own thoughts strange. Raphael frowned and turned around. Seeing his affection for Annette grow like this, he became anxious. He had always been alone and so, felt much more comfortable like that. Because of this, he was determined to continue living like that in the future.* * *A white, elegant hand came close, as if it was about to grasp Annette\u2019s hand. But the hand, moving like a white snake, only circled around her hand, lightly brushing against the bandage. The owner of the hand said in a chillingly soft tone.\u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. There was an accident.\u201dAnnette answered casually and shifted her injured hand to the side. Maybe a week or so later she could remove the bandage. But the man looking at Annette\u2019s injured hand didn\u2019t seem to think so at all. The purple-haired man with a gorgeous face clicked his tongue.\u201cYou have beautiful hands, but what a pity! It would be hard to embroider like this.\u201dOnly then did Annette recall how she had boasted about her embroidery skills in their last meeting. She replied, covering her hands feeling ashamed. She was really relieved that the veil couldn\u2019t show her face.\u201cIt\u2019ll get better soon. It\u2019s just a minor injury.\u201dThe person who Annette was conversing with right now, was Railin Mosley, who ran the smuggling guild \u201cSecret.\u201d He had promised Annette last time that he would send her all the information on smuggling, and because of that, they finally got in touch.Railin handed a thick report, finely bending his red ruby-like eyes. Annette casually took it and checked the contents. It had information about all the good villages to settle in Osland, recommended jobs there, and even the average price of housing and land prices. She was satisfied as she could meticulously plan and make a good choice with this.\u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019ll take a look. After making up my mind, I\u2019ll contact you.\u201d\u201cI am glad that you liked it. Please feel free to contact us for further information or advice. Our \u2018Secret\u2019 always prioritises our customer\u2019s satisfaction first.\u201dRailin snickered. Annette looked at his face unknowingly. His colorful purple hair, which resembled hyacinths, had beautiful curls, and his hooded, feline red eyes had a decadent beauty. Particularly, the mole near his smiling mouth made his divine beauty reach its zenith.If Railin had been born as a woman, the men of Deltium sure would have thrown all their riches to his feet and offered their everything to him. He was the type of person who could enslave people with just a wink or a smile.\u2018I envy you.\u2019Annette\u2019s eyes, under the veil, were filled with envy. All she had learned to do was to keep a noble and graceful smile, to raise her chin high, and maintain a graceful and dignified posture. These things might be helpful for her social life, but they were pretty useless when it came to improve her relationship with her husband. It would have been nice if she also had such a bewitching beauty.At this time, Railin suddenly opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if this seems rude to you, but I just want to know why you want to leave this place? You don\u2019t really look like you\u2019re lacking anything, so if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to ask you why.\u201dAnnette was startled at his sudden question. She had never revealed her identity before, but he asked as if he knew who Annette was. Seeing Annette become wary and silent, Railin said in a nonchalant tone, as if asking about her neighbors next door.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry if you found my question offensive. I am asking this so that we can take care of the situation, just in case, if your husband tries to find you in the future. That\u2019s why I just wanted to check in advance.\u201dThis made it clear that Railin knew who she was. She had very carefully hidden her identity while coming to this place, so she could not understand how this happened. Annette, who had been silent for a while, sighed and said.\u201cYou know who I am, right?\u201d\u201cAs you know, my business is not only limited to smuggling. If my informants are slow, how can a beauty like me survive in this harsh place?\u201dRailin, who operated in the dark and headed the guild \u2018Secret\u2019, shrugged his shoulders with a proud expression. He had actually guessed Annette\u2019s identity from the beginning. At that time he was a bit wary of her because of her high status, as it made it a little difficult for her to be smuggled out of the kingdom.When Annette looked at her bandaged hand, everything became clear to her. Railin\u2019s information guild was competent enough to find out for what kind of treatment the physician was invited to the house of Marquis of Carnesis. Railin looked at his precious customer with an elegant smile.Meanwhile, Annette was very displeased with her identity being revealed. Her cold eyes had already drawn a boundary between them. Railin, noticing this, waved his hand and spoke softly.\u201cOur \u2018Secret\u2019 always puts our customers first. It was very pitiful to see our precious customer experience unreasonable inconvenience by covering your face. So please do not doubt our faith.\u201dThe actual hidden meaning behind this bullshit was \u2018I already know your identity, so don\u2019t use a useless veil.\u2019 Annette was surprised by Railin\u2019s wit, he turned out to be sharper than she thought.Annette sighed and quietly took off the veiled hat. Actually, she felt very stuffy wearing the hat that covered her whole face down to the neck. Fortunately, as long as she was a \u2018customer\u2019, Railin was unlikely to reveal anything about her to others. In the first place, if he had been a man who carelessly revealed or talked about his customer\u2019s information, the Secret Guild would not have been as big as it is now.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe moment he saw Annette\u2019s face with her veil removed, Railin let out a brief exclamation. She didn\u2019t know what it meant, but she was very uncomfortable. The fact that the other party knew her identity made her feel quite wary of him.\u2018Maybe Raphael also felt this way when I caught him sleepwalking.\u2019Annette ended up sympathising with Raphael in an unexpected place and closed her eyes. Just as she thought of Raphael, a thought naturally came to her mind. Annette carefully asked about Railin\u2019s other businesses.\u201cThen can I ask you to investigate something? I want to know something about my husband\u2019s iron ore mine.\u201d\u201cOf course, but I\u2019d like you to answer my question first. If you were to smuggle out of the kingdom, would your husband try to find you? It\u2019s a really important matter.\u201dRailin, who smiled brightly, looked so beautiful that she felt dizzy. However, if you look closely, it was also a very inscrutable face. Railin, who made it difficult to grasp what was going on in his mind, was a really tough opponent. It was clear he would not give any information until he heard Annette\u2019s answer.But Annette didn\u2019t want to be dragged around at his pace either. Now that she was inwardly displeased because of her identity being exposed, she smiled gracefully and retorted.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you figure it out with the help of your information guild. I think you can do it.\u201dSeeing a modest and docile looking Annette unexpectedly counterattack, Railin\u2019s eyes widened and the smile on his face became a little stiff. Annette thought he was angry at her, but unexpectedly, Railin burst into laughter.\u201cHa-ha, what a pleasant surprise! Okay. We\u2019ll take care of this problem. Please consider it as a small apology for offending you.It had been a long time since Railin had laughed carelessly without any meaning. It was a smile as bright as that of a young boy. Annette trembled seeing the strangely pleasing face. Seeing that her counterattack didn\u2019t have much effect on him, she was very embarrassed.\u201cOkay. Then contact me as soon as you get the information. Thank you very much.\u201dThe longer the deal with Railin was kept, the better it was. Although it was very annoying that her identity had been exposed, Annette decided to go out shamelessly since it had already turned out like this. Elegantly raising her head, Annette stood up from her seat. When Railin saw it, he thought to himself,\u2018The more I see it, the more I like it.\u2019Recently, Railin had been having a growing \u2018personal interest\u2019 in her. Of course, if one asked Annette whether she was interested in the opposite sex, she would vehemently deny. The Annette, in his eyes, was like a treasure that stood out in the eyes of a very picky collector.Railin, as the top predator in the underworld, had a very luxurious taste. His picky eyes were as high as the Duke of Bavaria. So there were only a few people who perfectly satisfied his demanding taste. Just like Annette, who had received severe education under Deltium\u2019s most prestigious family.\u2018I\u2019m satisfied just by looking at it.\u2019Railin\u2019s ruby red eyes glanced over at Annette\u2019s sitting posture. His eyes slowly raked over her elegant neck and slender waist to the rich hem of the neat dress. She looked like a perfect aristocrat, which made her more pleasing to the eye. When he saw her taking off the veil, Railin, for the first time in his life, wanted to embalm someone to keep them as they were for forever.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get back to you soon, customer. You\u2019ll probably be satisfied with our information.\u201dRailin, who hid his dark heart, smiled brightly and saw Annette off. Just as she was about to turn around, Railin lowered his head. and whispered in Annette\u2019s ear with a dizzying smile.\u201cSince today, I had the honor of seeing your face and make a good relation with you, I would like to offer you a small favor. When you leave here, it would be better if you use the back door if possible. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to go through quite a nuisance.\u201dRailin, placing his fingers on his lips, smiled very meaningfully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It would have been better if Railin had given her more details, but he just stood there smiling with his mouth tightly shut.Annette rebelled by raising her chin proudly. She straightened her body to show a perfect aristocratic figure, something that had been imprinted into her bones.\u201cIt isn\u2019t good to avoid the problems in your life. Sometimes there are things that we have to face in person. So I\u2019ll go out from the front door. No matter what\u2019s waiting there, it\u2019s a challenge I have to face.\u201d\u201cPlease do as you please.\u201dWith a short reply, Railin bowed and showed her out. He knew Annette would surely regret it, but he didn\u2019t want to give her anymore hints. When he listened to her say, \u2018Sometimes there are things that we have to face in person\u2019, Railin\u2019s bewitching lips held a nasty smile.Annette pressed her hat firmly to cover her face and then headed towards the front door with confident steps. Whatever was waiting there, she had intended to solve it herself. However in less than five minutes, Annette regretted not listening to Railin\u2019s words.\u2018I should\u2019ve just gone out from the back door!\u2019She wanted to hit her five minutes ago past self. Of course, avoiding the problems didn\u2019t solve them. But sometimes there were problems in the world that were better to avoid. For example, the Crown Prince Ludwig, who was now standing in front of her.\u201cAnnette.\u201dLudwig, who had tied his long silver hair together, carefully called out her name. His graceful face, which seemed to be molded out of silver, was distorted as if he would cry any moment. Annette, who saw this, also wanted to cry with him. Even after having Celestine as his fiancee, why did he keep on running into her?\u201cAnnette, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry!!\u201dAs Crown Prince Ludwig was approaching her with a sad face, he bumped into a roadside tree and grabbed his forehead in pain. Ludwig was a man with luscious silver hair, tall height, and beautiful features. Sometimes seeing him, she even wondered if he was a prince who had come out of a fairy tale. However, unlike his perfect appearance, Ludwig had an amazing skill that could make him break his nose even if he fell backwards on a bare floor.Annette found it ironic that Ludwig, who was so clumsy, was actually the half brother of Raphael, who was about to become a Sword Master. Even though she thought like this, she still gently put her handkerchief on Ludwig\u2019s forehead.\u201cYour Highness, how did you get here? Did you follow me?\u201dAnnette\u2019s voice speaking to the crown prince was soft, but her eyes and tone were quite firm. Annette was wearing a veiled hat to visit the Secret. So, let alone her face, even her neck was completely hidden.Nevertheless, as soon as Ludwig saw her, he called out her name at once. Seeing that he could recognise her even without seeing her face, someone would have thought, \u201cAmazing, this is the power of love!\u201d But Annette knew people wouldn\u2019t believe this. They would rather most likely think that she had followed him from the time he went out.Her identity had already been exposed today, so Annette was quite wary of him. As she was a married woman, there was nothing good in getting involved with Ludwig. Seeing Annette\u2019s reluctance, Ludwig didn\u2019t come closer and looked very lonely\u201cAnnette, I know this would be a nuisance to you. I\u2019m really aware of it. But\u2026. I couldn\u2019t stand it. It\u2019s so painful. There\u2019s no one to whom I can bare my heart to. Annette, there\u2019s no-one except you.\u201dLudwig wistfully lowered his silver eyelashes. A terrible loneliness and pain passed by his blue eyes. It was such a sad sight that any woman on seeing it, would want to comfort him. But Annette gently refuted Ludwig\u2019s words without any agitation.\u201cYou already have a fiance. Not only that, there are also many people who want to consult with Your Highness regarding Deltium. You\u2019re like this only because you don\u2019t allow it. Please open your heart and make new connections. Relationships are important, Your Highness.\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re saying this because you don\u2019t know! Celestine, she\u2019s really\u2026 so different from you that I can\u2019t even compare. I, Annette\u2026. I can\u2019t even think of her as my fiancee\u2026\u201dWhile Ludwig was speaking, his emotions were all over the place and he burst into tears. With a disposition similar to that of a musician, he basically had a sensitive and uneasy personality. So, Annette would always try to cheer him up whenever she was by his side. In a good sense, she was like a pillar to him providing him with emotional support but actually, if seen in a straightforward way\u2026.She was nothing but his emotional trash can.Annette calmly judged. What if Ludwig had gotten along well with his new fiancee, Celestine Keers? He probably would not have clinged to her like he was doing now. Annette wondered if Ludwig really liked her as a woman or if he was just relying on her to seek some sort of maternal love. Well, either way it didn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201cAnnete, please. Don\u2019t push me away so coldly. If you also do this to me, I really\u2026\u2026.\u201dTears flowed down from Ludwig\u2019s blue eyes, which were wide open, as if in agony. With trembling hands, he carefully grabbed Annette\u2019s hand and placed his forehead on the back of it. The gesture seemed as if he was praying and begging to her. His beautiful appearance made it further look as if he was reverently worshipping her.But Annette wasn\u2019t really unnerved on seeing this. She had come to the smuggling guild with the intention of leaving Raphael. Even though she had made up her mind about it, she was still Raphael\u2019s wife. If she now accepted Ludwig\u2019s affection out of pity, she would end up hurting Raphael later. If she had to hurt either of them, it would be the right choice to hurt Ludwig, rather than Raphael.\u201cYour Highness, I really feel sorry for the pain you\u2019re going through right now. I sincerely hope Your Highness would be able to find some peace of mind and be happy. But I can\u2019t be what you want. I am already married to Raphael.\u201dAnnette pulled out her hand from Ludwig\u2019s grasp in a gentle but determined manner. And then took a step back from him, drawing a line between them. She only just listened to Ludwig\u2019s complaints, and didn\u2019t go forward to comfort him. She didn\u2019t want to cause any misunderstandings between her and Raphael later. She was not that kindhearted to entertain such immature behavior.Seeing Annette withdraw her hand, Ludwig slowly looked at his empty hand. His breathing gradually faded, and his beautiful face distorted into an expression of crazy despair.\u201cRaphael, that damn Raphael! Everyone only just talks about him. It would have been better if he was the Crown Prince. Even father thinks so!\u201dLudwig\u2019s bloodshot blue eyes looked terribly similar to that of Raphael\u2019s. Ludwig was a person who always stayed quiet. So, it was quite rare to see him shout like this. Seeing him clutching and pulling his beautiful silver hair, it was clear that the pain in his heart was much more than in his body.\u201cThen what the hell am I born for? What is the purpose of my existence? If I hadn\u2019t been born, Raphael would have been the heir to the throne!! He took everything from me. My Father\u2019s acknowledgement, reputation, even you Annette, even you\u2026.\u2026!!\u201d[T/N: Ludwig calls his father Imperial father. I\u2019m just keeping it to father because imperial father, to me, doesn\u2019t go with the flow. ]Listening to Ludwig wail, Annette sighed inwardly. It seemed that King Selgratis compared Ludwig to Raphael. King Selgratis was a good king, but he had never been a good father.King Selgratis had always been displeased with the fact that the kingdom\u2019s only prince was terribly unfit and was a musician who liked to play lute. Perhaps that was why he would often insult Ludwig by comparing him to his illegitimate son, Raphael. Ludwig was very sensitive, so he was deeply distressed by his father\u2019s attitude towards him. Still, he longed for his father\u2019s acknowledgement. This was the main factor that drove Ludwig to madness.\u201cTell me, Annette. Do you also think Raphael is more capable than me? Is that why\u2026 you\u2019re cold-heartedly pushing me away? Compared to that great Raphael Carnesis, I am now not even a man in your eyes!\u201dFrom Ludwig\u2019s blue eyes, a drop of tear slowly flowed down his face. He had come to seek some comfort for his broken heart, but he ended up becoming even more hurt. It was all because Annette had rejected him. Since childhood, from the time they first saw each other, Annette had always been Ludwig\u2019s only companion. At least it had always been like that for Ludwig. So Annette\u2019s rejection only drove Ludwig to the extreme.Annette, listening to his wails, silently closed her eyes. Ludwig was actually not a bad person. However, he was very weak and tended to become somewhat mentally dependent on others. Annette had always kind to the people who wanted to lean on her, but now she couldn\u2019t. It was because Ludwig repeatedly picked on Raphael.Raphael also did not have a life full of comforts. To everyone, he looked like a man who didn\u2019t lack anything except for a pure lineage. He was protected by the king, had outstanding swordsmanship skills, was well-known among people and even had a Marquis title. But all of this was obtained from Raphael\u2019s hardwork. Unlike Ludwig, he had to grit his teeth and grind his bones to reach till here. Annette, who knew this well, coldly looked at him.\u201cYour Highness Ludwig.\u201dFor the first time in his life, he had heard Annette call his name out in a cold voice. The moment he met her eyes, Ludwig was stunned. It was as if he looking at a stranger. Annette had changed the atmosphere of the whole conversation just by calling out his name once.\u201cTo tell you the truth, I don\u2019t understand this situation very well. As you know, I was falsely accused, and your Highness at that time let go of my hand. Of course, I know very well that the situation at that time was unfavorable. But no matter what, Your Highness should have protected me, if I was as precious to you as you say. Am I not right?\u201d\u201cAnnette, that\u2026 Listen to me, then I\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, Your Highness should listen to me. At that time, Your Highness was afraid of His Majesty\u2019s wrath, so you just gave up on me. I was not only removed from the list of candidates for the Crown Princess, but also ended up getting married as if I was being sold. It\u2019s obvious that I\u2019m the biggest victim in this situation. But instead of blaming Your Highness, I tried to understand you. But why is Your Highness trying to blame me now?\u201dAnnette\u2019s tone was neither exactly woeful nor was it filled with anger. She made her argument in a calm tone, as if she was reading from a book. But with her every word, Ludwig felt as if he someone had punched his stomach. It hurted like hell.But Annette didn\u2019t stop there. Her silent rage had just begun now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her smooth rebuttal stabbed Ludwig in his heart.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t want me to get married, then why did you run away at that time? You could have done something using your powers behind the scene to stop the formal marriage. If you had at least tried to get rid of my charges, I wouldn\u2019t be so angry right now.\u201dLudwig claimed that he loved her, yet he still hadn\u2019t noticed the bandage on her hand. Even Railin, who was nothing more than just a business partner, had noticed it.Ludwig only complained and wailed about his pain every time, and Annette always listened and comforted him. It had always been like that for nearly ten years. So Ludwig seemed to have forgotten that she too could feel pain just like him. Annette said coldly, suppressing her surging emotions.\u201cI too can also get hurt, Your Highness. If you really wanted to marry me, you should have done something. So please admit your cowardice and let me go. I want to live a new life and start afresh.\u201dIt was only after hearing Annette that Ludwig realized it quite late, that he was being too immature with Annette. The Annette in Ludwig\u2019s memory always had a gentle smile and sincerely listened to his worries and anxieties. So from some point on, he started to take it for granted.But now, the Annette in front of him was like a complete stranger. The cold eyes and indifferent face were something that didn\u2019t belong to the Annette he knew. She didn\u2019t even bat an eye when she saw Ludwig gasping in pain. Under her cold gaze Ludwig opened his mouth and desperately tried to make some excuses.\u201cAnnette, I did my best. You don\u2019t know how many times I had begged my father not to do that, and that I couldn\u2019t be without you. But I couldn\u2019t convince him..\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, Your Highness.\u201dAnnette coldly cut off Ludwig\u2019s excuses. It was something that happened five years ago before her regression. She thought she had forgotten everything, but it seemed that she hadn\u2019t forgotten anything. Annette\u2019s voice slightly wavered as she refuted Ludwig\u2019s excuses.\u201cI think it would be more right to say that it wasn\u2019t the best that you could do, but it was something that you did just for pretense. If you want to save someone from drowning, shouldn\u2019t you either swim in or at least throw a lifeline? You say that you did your best, but all you\u2019ve done is just watch everything from afar and throw a fit. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201dAnnette had always thought that she would marry Ludwig since childhood. The young boy and girl who were matched earlier, only had each other. The betrayal that she felt when her expectations were broken, was so bitter that she wanted to vomit blood.Annette, of course, knew it very well that Ludwig was very weak against his father. But no matter what, she never expected him to give up on her so easily. She never thought he would turn away from her so quickly. Ludwig easily accepted the new engagement. He only made a few weak protests and after that pretended to give in as if he couldn\u2019t win.Nevertheless, Annette wasn\u2019t angry at him. It wasn\u2019t because Ludwig was a prince or anything. It was because she just knew nothing would change even if she got angry at him. By nature, Ludwig was indecisive and weak-minded. So there was no point in being angry with such a person, for not being on her side. It would only make the mouth of the speaker hurt.So Annette somehow put up with it. Seeing that it was meaningless to hold on to such anger, she just silently let it go. But today, Ludwig\u2019s past feelings and his betrayal made that anger crawl out from her mouth. Strangely, she felt relieved as well as sick. Annette completely cut him off her life, by saying,\u201cAnd if you have any respect for me, please don\u2019t do this again. Please never talk about my husband like that again. Raphael is a good man, and despite my bad situation, he willingly welcomed me as his wife. Now he is my family. No one can ever criticise my family in front of me. Do you understand me?\u201dLudwig was completely speechless. Annette\u2019s attitude of drawing a line between them by saying that Raphael was her family, was so painful that his fingers became numb. The woman who he once believed was the closest person to him was now the one who was the farthest. This broke his heart, and unwittingly tears rolled down his pallid cheeks.Annette was right. He was really a coward. He had always taken her for granted and because of this, he lost Annette\u2019s hand forever. No matter how many tears he shed, they could now never go back to their old relationship. This fact made him feel as if he had plunged into a swamp. Annette said goodbye to Ludwig, who looked at her blankly in despair.\u201cI would be grateful if you could generously forgive me for my rude behavior today. Please, after today never visit me for your personal business again. Then I\u2019ll get going now.\u201dAfter finishing what she had to say, Annette turned around. It was actually very disrespectful to show one\u2019s back to a member of the royal family without their permission. But today, she wanted to do something blasphemous. After all, it was all because they didn\u2019t do anything, that she was falsely framed and fell to the bottom.Honestly, it was not that she didn\u2019t find the sight of Ludwig, with a distorted face and shedding tears heartbreaking. After all, she had been with Ludwig since her childhood. They were old childhood friends and she even sometimes treated him like her family. Ludwig, who suffered from the lack of acknowledgement from his father, was always sad. So she always had wanted to stay by his side to cheer him up.However, it was Ludwig who let go of her hand first, and brought an end to their relationship.Annette lightly walked away from him, like a butterfly leaving a flower. Ludwig, now couldn\u2019t dare to catch her or force her.He couldn\u2019t do anything, just like the day when Annette was framed. He again had no choice but to look at her distant back,as she went away from him. He stood there until his last tear scattered and dried away.* * *\u201cI\u2019m home, honey.\u201dAfter returning home, Annette ran into Raphael, who was wandering around the front door. She habitually smiled and greeted him affectionately. Raphael\u2019s broad shoulders suddenly flinched as if he was startled, and he turned towards her in a strangely awkward movement.\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201dRaphael\u2019s expression on seeing Annette became very strange. He was looking at her, but somehow couldn\u2019t make eye contact with her. All of these actions made him feel very clumsy. In the first place, Raphael had never been a self-conscious person, so it was very awkward.Annette wondered why he was being like this. He looked at her as if he had something to say, but his firm lips were tightly shut. Annette tilted her head a little and finally asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Raphael? Is there something on my face?\u201d\u201cNo. You must be tired, so go in and rest.\u201dRaphael furtively avoided Annette\u2019s gaze and bolted upstairs. Annette, who was left alone on the porch, looked at his fleeting back with puzzled eyes. Seeing Raphael\u2019s strange behavior, she wondered if he knew that she had ran into Ludwig again. But if that was the case, Raphael would have been angry at her, as he was the type of person who couldn\u2019t contain his displeasure.\u2018Good thing! I guess he doesn\u2019t know that I ran into Prince Ludwig.\u2019Annette was relieved and decided to be more careful in the future. In her previous life, because of being falsely framed, her mind became unstable, so she started having a little aversion to socializing. Because of this, she didn\u2019t go out much often. And on top of that, her body was very sick and weak, making it almost impossible to socialize with others.Because of this, Annette had never ran into Prince Ludwig after her marriage in her previous life. However, now she was very anxious about encountering him again. What changes will these little variables bring in the future? Annette was worried about that.\u2018I should have listened to Mr. Railin\u2019s advice.\u2019Annette recalled Railin\u2019s words telling her to go out from the back door to avoid any nuisance. Indeed, he really had amazing intelligence and gut instincts. No matter how big a figure he was in the underworld, it was quite daring of him to dismiss Ludwig, the crown prince of Deltium, as a mere \u2018nuisance\u2019. Unlike his beautiful appearance, Railin sure was a man with great capabilities.Annette vowed to take Railin\u2019s words seriously in the future. She trudged up to her bedroom, dragging her tired body. After saying out everything she held against Ludwig in her heart, she felt relieved as well as exhausted.Annette, after taking a warm bath, soon fell into a deep sleep. So again she didn\u2019t notice Raphael sneaking into her bed.\u2018You really sleep as if you are dead.\u2019Lying obliquely, Raphael looked down at the sleeping Annette with his head in one arm. Even after seeing her like this countless times, he still strangely did not get tired of seeing Annette\u2019s face. Raphael, who had been looking down at Annette with a strange look, muttered suddenly.\u201cI\u2019m your family\u2026.\u201dRaphael had earlier questioned Annette\u2019s maid, Mary, and roughly dug out all her whereabouts. Of course, Annette did not reveal the exact location to anyone. But with Raphael\u2019s beastly senses, he somehow managed to track her down.Fortunately, today the fate was on Annette\u2019s side. Raphael did not see the \u2018Secret\u2019 guild. It was because he arrived a little late at the scene, as he was searching for the ambiguous place that he had heard from the maid. Thanks to that, when Raphael found Annette, she had already left Secret.However, the problem was that there was another man standing next to her. And that man was none other than Crown Prince Ludwig.\u2018What\u2019s going on here?At first, Raphael had almost misunderstood that Annette was secretly meeting Ludwig. In fact, it was a very convincing scene. As soon as he saw Annette facing Ludwig, Raphael literally felt all the blood in his body become cold. However the conversation between them was far from that of a secret meeting.\u201cTell me, Annette. Do you also think Raphael is more capable than me? Is that why\u2026 you\u2019re cold-heartedly pushing me away? Compared to that great Raphael Carnesis, I am now not even a man in your eyes!\u201dThe moment he heard Ludwig\u2019s wails from afar, Raphael felt relieved. Annette wasn\u2019t cheating on him, rather she was rejecting the clingy Ludwig. Raphael couldn\u2019t understand why he felt so happy about this.But it didn\u2019t just end there. Raphael squinted his eyes and waited for Annette\u2019s next reaction. He was nervous as he couldn\u2019t see her expression as she stared at Ludwig.Why isn\u2019t she answering anything? Raphael\u2019s heart was beating strangely and there was a numb ringing sensation in his ears. It was a physical abnormality that was unlikely to belong to a Sword Master.\u2018Should I just rather leave now?\u2019Raphael couldn\u2019t stand it as he was afraid to hear Annette\u2019s reply. What if she really changed her mind? What if everything she told him was a lie? What if it was a lie when she said it was better to marry him than be a princess? What if she abandoned him and chose Ludwig, who had pure noble blood?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But if Annette chose Ludwig here\u2026\u2026 He could never live as well as he did before.He knew it was just a political marriage, and Annette was from the damn Bavarian family\u2026 But why did he feel this way? Raphael wanted to run away from the scene right away. But as he was about to take action, Annette said in a very firm tone.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t want me to get married, then why did you run away at that time? You could have done something using your powers behind the scene to stop the formal marriage.\u201dRaphael\u2019s heart sank as soon as he heard it. Was Annette so disgusted with their political marriage? Because of the shock, the ringing in his ear became louder and he could hardly listen what Annette said next.\u201cIf you had\u2026 tried to\u2026 you should have done\u2026. I wouldn\u2019t be so\u2026.\u201dRaphael went a little closer to them as he tried to catch his breath. He wanted to check the situation with his own eyes and ears. He had a slight fear of being caught as he approached them closer and closer. Because all his senses were running wild, he couldn\u2019t grasp the situation in front of him. And then, Annette\u2019s last words struck Raphael\u2019s ear.Annette raised her head and said something Raphael could never had imagined.\u201cAnd if you have any respect for me, please don\u2019t do this again. Please never talk about my husband like that again. Raphael is a good man, and despite my bad situation, he willingly welcomed me as his wife. Now he is my family. No one can ever criticise my family in front of me. Do you understand me?\u201dThe moment Raphael heard it, he was utterly speechless. Strangely the inside of his throat was heating up. He had neither ever been nice to Annette nor had ever trusted her. But Annette was still faithful to him.Annette\u2019s words painted him as someone who was very attentive and generous. It sounded as if he was the world\u2019s most wonderful man. But this made Raphael feel more like a scumbag.\u201cPlease, after today never visit me for your personal business again. Then I\u2019ll get going now.\u201dAnnette turned her back after finishing what she had to say. From the noblest, most exalted and loved prince of the Deltium, without any hesitation, she stepped away only to come back home\u2026to him.Seeing this, Raphael felt a bit like crying for the first time. Annette\u2019s confident gait and her upright back dazzled him. Ludwig standing far away looked somewhat miserable. Raphael just kept on tenaciously looking at her back until she completely disappeared from his sight.\u2018My family\u2026.\u2019Raphael repeated her words in his mind. Fortunately, he wasn\u2019t caught by Annette while following her. After returning home, Annette was a little suspicious of his strange attitude, but fortunately she did not doubt anything.After Annette fell asleep, Raphael sneaked into her bedroom and silently stared at her sleeping face. This little woman constantly evoked strange feelings in him.Is this woman harmful or good to me? Raphael looked at the beautiful riddle before his eyes, unable to answer at all. Then laying beside her, he slowly closed his eyes. The small regular breathing sound that came into his ears was very warm and soothing.* * *It was windy today. Perhaps that\u2019s why a wonderful scent came from the lilacs blooming in the backyard. But the scent wasn\u2019t more fragrant than the scent coming from Annette\u2019s hair and neck.Annette was sitting on the sofa staring hard at something. Raphael, who was hugging Annette from behind, bit and licked her little ears, which were revealed through her hair. Annette, trapped in Raphael\u2019s arms, shuddered and shrugged her shoulders. A twinkling bell-like laughter erupted from her mouth.\u201cIt tickles, Raphael.\u201d\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dJust like a big beast, Raphael, who had disturbed Annette, bowed his head and reached out to see the thing that Annette had been looking at so seriously. It was an invitation letter with letters carved in silver on a thin, rustling high-quality paper.\u201cGarden Evening Party? Looks like it\u2019s being held by Marquis Eloque.\u201d\u201cYes, the summer garden there is quite beautiful. Have you ever been there?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dRaphael didn\u2019t like to go out in crowded places. The women flirted with him with envious eyes, and the men looked at him with disapproving gazes and scorned him from behind. Since they were no match to Raphael when it came to looks and abilities, all they could attack him with was his lineage.The fiery Raphael could not endure such things. He also had sharp ears. So whenever he caught them insulting him, he would rashly turn the place upside down and scare away the rat like people. But it was also quite distasteful towards the host to make a fuss at the ball every time, so Raphael naturally became reluctant towards attending such socializing events.Still, it was okay if the organizer was Marquis Eloque. Eloque family advocated political neutrality and had a long prestigious history, so their guests must be quite cultured. Annette had planned to make her first public appearance here after her marriage. She needed to meet Celestine Keers again to clear herself of all the false charges.\u2018Celestine, no matter what, would attend the party of Marquis Eloque.\u2019The party\u2019s organizer Marquis Eloque\u2019s wife was the chairman of Celestine\u2019s book club. So Celestine was probably going to attend this party.When Annette thought of facing Celestine again, her heart throbbed. She was anxious and afraid, but on the other hand she was also looking forward to it. It would the first time she would encounter Celestine since her \u2018kidnapping\u2018 incident. Annette wondered if she would again pretend to be the victim before her eyes.Raphael didn\u2019t know why Annette looked so grim. He looked at Annette\u2019s eyes looking down at the invitation. She looked like a rabbit who had decided to fight a rattlesnake. So Raphael asked her with half curiosity and half anxiety.\u201cAre you going? This party\u2026\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 yeah, I\u2019m thinking about it.\u201dAnnette answered frankly. Raphael, who carefully opened the invitation, looked quite displeased. He swept his glance over the place and time written on the invitation.\u201cThe opening time is too late. What if it ends up quite late in the night and you encounter some strange people on the way? Not only that, the place is also outdoors. What if you catch a cold? Would Marquis Eloque take the responsibility?\u201dAnnette wondered why Raphael suddenly started finding faults with the party. Summer outdoor garden parties were usually held at night. It was because it was too hot during the day. Annette blinked her eyes a couple of times and replied calmly.\u201cBut it\u2019s summer now. It will be a little cool at night, so one will feel better. And since it\u2019s an evening party, I think it should end up before 9 o\u2019clock. So it will be okay.\u201dAnnette\u2019s answer was very reasonable. But it wasn\u2019t the answer Raphael wanted. He furrowed his dark eyebrows and bit Annette\u2019s ears, as if he was complaining\u201cI mean, it\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s dangerous to catch a cold and it\u2019s also dangerous on the way back. Anyway, it\u2019s too dangerous to have a party at night.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026So you\u2019re telling me not to go?\u201dAnnette, who had been silent for a while, turned her head and looked at Raphael. The Marquis Eloque\u2019s evening party was a perfect place for Annette\u2019s re-debut after marriage. In addition, there was a high possibility that Celestine, who was busy preparing for the coronation, would come.Such an opportunity was rare to come. Annette wanted to attend this party as much as possible. But if Raphael kept trying to stop her this way, she had no choice but to fight him. Anticipating the impending fight, Annette\u2019s eyes drooped gloomily.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant!\u201dRaphael, who saw this, raised his voice without realizing it. Then Annette\u2019s body, which had been held in his arms, shrank in surprise. She was frightened because he suddenly screamed harshly in her ear. Seeing this, Raphael frowned and chastised himself for his behavior.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with me these days?\u2019He realized that he was being overly clingy towards Annette these days. Today again, he wandered around her without any work and then tried to find opportunities to talk to her. He even took away the invitation like a child. All this was really unacceptable behavior.He was like this because of Annette\u2019s words that he heard while following her last time. She kept praising him as a good husband, so he wanted to be that person. But he felt like a clown. Anyway, even after seeing Annette\u2019s wary expression, he couldn\u2019t stop. Raphael gently softened his voice and spat out.\u201cI mean\u2026. it\u2019s dangerous, so I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d\u201cYou will come with me?\u201dAnnette doubted her ears. She and Raphael had never attended a party together in their previous lives. It was because their marital life was really bad.In addition, Annette had some sort of fear at that time. Even though her family had suppressed all the rumours, still there was no eternal secret in this world. She was afraid that people would pretend to be oblivious in front of her, only to gossip behind her back. So, Annette could not afford to go outside the mansion. Because of this, they didn\u2019t attend a single party as a couple.\u201cWhy, don\u2019t you want me to go?\u201dSeeing that Annette was silent, Raphael\u2019s handsome eyebrows wriggled as he looked at her. If it was like before, he probably would have sarcastically asked her if she was ashamed of her illegitimate husband. But now that he had seen Annette defend him several times, it was a little different. He knew she wouldn\u2019t be ashamed of him.However Raphael\u2019s twisted personality was sometimes expressed in this way. It was his way of pressurising to answer quickly that she would like him to come with her. Annette, who knew this well, shook her head and laughed.\u201cNo way. It would be great if I could go to the party with you. I would be really happy.\u201dRaphael flinched at Annette\u2019s friendly words, and then turned his head slightly. The area around his temple was slightly red. Perhaps Annette listened to his thoughts and relieved him with a single word.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So she didn\u2019t notice his flushed face. She then recalled an unfortunate memory of her past life.\u2018In my previous life, I couldn\u2019t attend his Sword Master celebration party. Maybe\u2026 This time again.. ?\u2019In her previous life, Raphael became a Sword Master thanks to his hard work and determination. But Annette was bedridden at that time. As she recalled, she realised that it happened about half a year before Annette died. At that time, a large banquet was held to celebrate his achievement of becoming a Sword Master.In fact, such a lavish celebration was actually worth it. Across the continent, it was rare to see Sword Masters emerge. It was such a high level talent that only one or two people could become Sword Masters in a generation. They were generally seen in large kingdoms like the Chapelle Empire, so it was quite rare to have one in a small kingdom like Deltium.Naturally, King Selgratis was not willing to miss this opportunity. It was a big deal to see such a talent appear in his kingdom, and moreover, it was none other than his own son! He wanted to show off Raphael\u2019s presence to establish the status of the kingdom. Thanks to this, grand celebrations were held throughout the entire kingdom of Deltium for a whole month.As a result, the crown prince\u2019s coronation ceremony became much less significant. However, Annette never attended all of these celebrations. She was very sick and wasn\u2019t on good terms with Raphael. Because of this, she had to soothe her bitterness by hearing about the scale of the celebrations only through words.\u2018Can it be different in this life?\u2019Annette wasn\u2019t sure. She hadn\u2019t even decided yet whether to Ieave Raphael or stay with him. To make a decision, she had to first find out what Raphael thought of her. As they were now going to the party together, she had a lot of time to ask him. Annette was planning to hear out Raphael sooner or later. She didn\u2019t want to hear \u2018I hate you\u2019 from him again.\u201cThen it\u2019s decided. Let\u2019s go to this party together.\u201dJust in time, Raphael roughly shook the invitation in his hand. The pretty invitation in his big, hard hand looked like a toy. Annette suppressed her bitter thoughts and smiled brightly. Yeah, just attending a party with Raphael was already changing her life. So she thought she could now have some optimistic expectations towards her new life.\u201cOkay, then shall we go get ready?\u201d\u201cReady? What?\u201dRaphael asked in confusion. Instead of answering his question, Annette closed her eyes and laughed. There were so many things to prepare to attend such a grand party. Especially as it was the first event that the couple would attend together, it was very meaningful for her.Fortunately, Annette had a fairly good knowledge about this field.* * *\u201cLady Annette! No, should I now call you Marchioness of Carnesis.?\u201dA smiling woman walked out of the luxurious dressing room and spread her arms open. She was very tall and thin, with red hair that looked like flames. She gave off a neutral and sophisticated image. Annette beamed on seeing her and also stretched her arms out to hug her.\u201cTina! I missed you so much!!\u201d\u201cMe, too. Oh, you have become more prettier! Look at this glowing skin and eyes as clear as pink topaz! Are you sleeping well these days?\u201dThe two women hugged each other and exchanged pleasant greetings. The designer Tina Hamilton, owner of the luxury boutique, Papillion, was nearly ten years older than Annette. Because of this, Tina had been in charge of her dresses since Annette was a little girl. For Annette, Tina was like her cousin. She was a friend who always made her feel comfortable.In her present life, she could not reunite with Tina. Considering the time before her regression, it had been a long time since she had seen her. In her previous life, Annette had stopped socializing completely. So she never had had any reason to visit the boutique. That\u2019s why she was very pleased to see Tina again and rekindle those good times with her.\u201cThis is my husband, Tina. Say hello.\u201dAfter exchanging greetings, Annette smiled and introduced Raphael to Tina. Raphael, who was watching the situation with his arms folded behind him, greeted awkwardly. This place was very strange to him as he had only been to private gentleman\u2019s boutiques where men exchanged only necessary words. The colorful fabrics that shone from all sides, the manner of overly clever clerks, and the scent of some unknown powder, everything was very unfamiliar to him.Tina noticed her customer\u2019s discomfort like a ghost and greeted them with a gentle smile. While smiling, her eyes were busy scanning Raphael\u2019s appearance. Tina\u2019s pupils, hidden between her smiling eyes, widened.\u201cOh, my God! You\u2019re as handsome as they say!\u201dTina\u2019s boutique, Papillion, was one of the three most famous places in the Deltium. She generally specialized in ladies\u2019 clothes, but the men\u2019s clothes from here were also famous. Since she was close to Annette, she also used to make clothes for Crown Prince Ludwig, as she thought he would marry Annette in the future.The Crown Prince, Ludwig had a rare luxurious appearance. His long and beautiful silvery hair and delicate features made him look like a work of art. However Tina personally assessed Raphael as the more attractive one.Raphael was one of the few noble men who only used the private boutiques for gentlemen. So it was the first time Tina had seen him. She was deeply impressed by this meeting. Look at that chiselled, sensual face and those wild, bright blue eyes! The charisma exuding from his whole body was very unique and sexy. He was the type of man that no woman could ever forget after meeting him.Tina silently looked at Annette and lifted her thumb up, pretending to be indifferent. Recognizing the meaning of the gesture, Annette burst into laughter and slapped Tina\u2019s arm. It was unlike her usual demeanor. Annette\u2019s face gleamed naturally in front of her friend who she had reunited after a long time.Raphael, for some unknown reason, couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Annette\u2019s smiling face, Even though he felt awkward in this strange place, his eyes, fixed on Annette, were dripping with honey. Tina smiled slyly seeing this.\u201cHuh.\u201dTina was actually very worried about her long-time client, Annette\u2019s marriage. Annette had a delicate and weak physique like a fine-grown lady. Raphael, on the other hand, was a young and capable handsome man, but the rumours about him were not very good. He was especially famous for his fiery and violent nature. Tina wondered if Annette could have a blissful marital life with such a man.\u2018If there\u2019s love, any problem can be easily overcome.\u2019Tina gazed at Raphael happily. Raphael\u2019s nervousness in a strange place was just like a big beast put in a cage. But seeing him stick very close to Annette, she thought he looked quite cute.Tina looked at the well-matched couple and somehow felt motivated. The feeling was even more special because she had designed Annette\u2019s wedding dress. Tina, with an excited smile, grabbed Annette\u2019s hand and asked.\u201cSo customer, what kind of dress are you here for today? From the exotic silks from the East to the multi-layered laces from Letan, we have everything, even the dyed fabrics using the latest ombre technique! All the perfect ingredients for the perfect dress are waiting for your choice.\u201d\u201cToday\u2026 I\u2019m here to find a dress for this party.\u201dAnnette showed Tina a thinly folded invitation. It was the invitation that she had received this morning. After receiving it, Tina took a closer look at it and threw some suggestions.\u201cIt\u2019s an evening garden party. Since it\u2019s an outdoor party that will be held at night, it would be good to make a shawl that goes well with the dress, so that you not only would get moderate exposure but also wouldn\u2019t catch a cold. Is there any color in your mind?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dInstead of saying the color, Annette just smiled. After seeing her meaningful smile, Tina immediately recognized Annette\u2019s intentions. After all Annette had been Tina\u2019s most valuable and oldest regular customer.\u201cYou\u2019re going to make your decision after seeing the dresses of other attendees first, right? Is there anyone who My Lady is particularly concerned about?\u201dTina lowered her voice and asked Annette. In the social world, information was equivalent to life. Only after getting a rough idea of the dresses and colors of the other attendees, could one refer their customers to choose a dress that will make them stand out. Having such information was a natural service for a well-known boutique in Deltium.If the ladies used dresses from less known boutiques that did not provide this information, they could sometimes face humiliation because of overlapping dresses with other attendees or falling behind the new fashion trends. So, a person like Annette, who was the daughter of the mighty Duke of Bavaria, could not afford to deal with such humiliation. In that respect, Tina had never let Annette down.\u201cTina, I heard\u2026\u2026that Lady Celestine will also be a part of this party.\u201d\u201cOh, you meant \u2018her\u2019. Of course I do.\u201dTina smiled gracefully and understood the meaning behind Annette\u2019s word. Tina herself didn\u2019t like Celestine much, as she had snatched the Crown Princess\u2019 position from Annette. Tina had always believed that one day she would make a dress for Annette\u2019s coronation. She had even collected some fabrics for it. But because of Celestine, who suddenly came from nowhere, it all came to a naught!Tina\u2019s feelings towards Celestine, naturally, were not quite good. Especially as the boutique which Celestine frequented was her competitor! So Tina pretended to be casual and told Annette what she had heard from the rumours.\u201cI heard someone say that she was going to wear a dress with a refreshing color, like a summer lemon. The whole fabric is embroidered with gold thread to make it look very bright and luxurious.\u201d\u201cHmm, gold on yellow fabric.\u201dIt would be a very good dress for Celestine who had brown hair. Annette was eagerly looking forward to this evening party. In her previous life, she had no chance to meet and talk to Celestine. Her family regarded Annette as an enemy, and made sure she could never approach Celestine again. Well, from their point of view, she was a villain as they believed Annette was the main culprit behind the kidnapping.\u2018This time, I must talk to Celestine.\u2019Annette thought hard about what to wear at the party. Then Tina picked up various fabric samples and showed them, as she had always done.\u201cIt\u2019s an evening party in a green garden, so how about a bright salmon pink color? It\u2019ll make you stand out as the color would be a nice contrast against the vegetation. Or we can go for a refreshing look by harmonising this light blue skirt with a silver bodice.\u201dIt was just then, Raphael, who had been standing awkwardly behind them, opened his mouth.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dRaphael\u2019s tone was quiet, but it held a strange power that could not be easily ignored. Maybe it was because he had been on the battlefield and had fought through life and death, his heavy voice had the effect of making people focus on him. Tina stopped talking and looked back at him.What Raphael was looking at was a pair of custom-made clothing on display on the side of the boutique. Seeing this, Tina explained with a bright business smile.\u201cOh, this is a couple\u2019s dress that is popular in the Chapelle Empire these days. When a couple or pair of lovers want to show off their relationship, they wear matching outfits. Isn\u2019t it lovely?\u201dThe woman\u2019s dress on display was stylish and feminine, with a dark navy skirt and a gorgeous red bodice. Meanwhile, the man\u2019s dress next to it consisted of a navy coat and dark red cravat in the same color scheme. Whoever saw it would definitely come to the conclusion that it\u2019s a set for a pair of couples.Raphael was staring at the costumes with a gaze full of interest. His eyes were so intense that she was worried that the fabric would be pierced.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 52": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/How to Tame My Beastly HusbandChapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTina looked at Raphael who was staring at the couple dress sample. As a designer, she found it quite interesting to be able to dress such a unique and wild handsome man. Taking Annette\u2019s permission, Tina approached Raphael with a smile.\u201cLet me see, you have black hair and blue eyes. Your skin is also white which overall gives off a cold feel. So colors like dark cobalt blue or silver gray would suit you, but unfortunately, such colors don\u2019t go well with Annette. Those heavy and cold shades don\u2019t suit Annette\u2019s softness and femininity.\u201dIt was this fine explanation that was the highlight of a fine boutique. As Tina explained all this smoothly like flowing water, she picked up a lot of fabrics. Among them, the most striking fabric was the white ivory one. The smooth fabric, embroidered with leaf patterns with silver thread, had a subtle splendor. Tina, who showed this to Raphael, went into her business mode.\u201cHow about this? Both of you have fair skin, so this white ivory color would look good on you. It would make your face look brighter, just like a lantern! It would be great if we could choose this as the background color of the coat and the robe!!\u201d\u201cThe color\u2026 is a little brighter than what I usually prefer. That\u2019s too\u2026\u201dRaphael furrowed his dark eyebrows, revealing a slight rejection. Then Tina smiled and slipped a piece of fabric around his neck.\u201cOh, what are you talking about? It suits you so well. Look!\u201dA handsome man was indeed a handsome man. When she put the white cloth around his neck, Raphael\u2019s face indeed became as bright as a lantern. With his cold face, dark black hair and blue eyes combined with the white cloth, he looked just like a Winter King.Annette unknowingly covered her mouth and looked at him with admiring eyes. Seeing this, all the discontent disappeared from his sulking face. If Annette could look at him with such eyes, it was worth trying on a bright outfit once in a while. When Tina noticed it, she tried not to laugh and brought up the next topic in a solemn manner.\u201cOkay, so the background color has been decided\u2026 Now we should choose the point color that you will use in common. Um, what color would you like?\u201dExcited, Tina hummed and took out a bunch of colorful, vivid fabrics. The bright vivid colors almost made him blind. Seeing Raphael\u2019s complexion become pale, Annette, who was quietly watching, opened her mouth.\u201cHow about we use purple shades? As in violet lavender or medium orchid color.\u201d\u201cGood choice! These colors are enough to be used as the point colors. They\u2019re all hard to pull off, so they\u2019ll be perfect to use as your own unique color! Which of these do you like the most? Now, please pick one!\u201dAn excited Tina took out a row of purple fabrics and spread them out in front of Raphael. Thanks to this, Raphael was in great confusion. \u2018Are you telling me that these are all different colors? How the hell are they all different?\u2019In Raphael\u2019s eyes, all the colors looked the same. The eyes which had never trembled even in the battlefield, were now shaking like an earthquake. Fortunately, Annette helped him out again.\u201cHow\u2019s this, Raphael?\u201dWhat Annette chose was a luxurious blue- violet color. Tina nodded as she picked it up and put it near Raphael\u2019s face.\u201cIt looks good! It makes his blue eyes stand out, making him look sexy.\u201d\u201cRight? If it\u2019s colors like this, I could also use them along with Raphael.\u201dAnnette smiled as she spoke. Her pink eyes went well with the purple fabric. Annette was exhilarated at the thought of going to a party wearing matching clothes with Raphael. The moment Raphael saw her bright smile, without any hesitation, he picked up the fabric that Annette had chosen and declared,\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take this.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good choice, I\u2019m sure. Now shall we take your measurements and then decide on the other details of your clothes?\u201dTina led them in with a satisfied face. With this, the discussion on what color to use for Annette\u2019s dress was also resolved. Fortunately, Annette was also satisfied with the decision. When the ivory white fabric was put together with the purple fabric, it looked elegant and gorgeous. Above all, she could wear a matching dress with Raphael. It was something that she could never imagine in her previous life, so it felt even more special to her.\u2018He\u2019s being really kind to me these days.\u2019As they were leaving the boutique after deciding all the measurements and details, Annette glanced at Raphael\u2019s side face. It seemed like a good time to ask about Raphael\u2019s feelings. He might not hate her anymore. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t go to a party like this and even agree to wear matching clothes with her.So Annette decided to muster up her courage and ask him. Raphael glanced back at her. As always, his face was cold and indifferent, which made one unable to know what he was thinking. As she looked at those cold eyes, a familiar anxiety came over her. But Annette bit her lips tightly and suppressed it. She wanted to believe that Raphael was now different from before.\u201cRaphael.\u201d\u201cHuh.\u201dRaphael replied briefly and instantly. But his gaze was not on Annette, but at a distant place. Annette, who was looking at Raphael\u2019s side face, was a little disappointed seeing him not give her, even one look. Nevertheless, Annette asked quietly, repressing her trembling heart.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for asking this question all of a sudden. Perhaps\u2026 what do you think of me? Are you still very uncomfortable..?\u201dRaphael gave no answer to her question. Looking somewhere far away, his face seemed to be lost in thought, as if he was immersed in something. Annette, who wondered if her question was too sudden, added a little explanation as an excuse.\u201cWell, as you know, our marriage wasn\u2019t a normal one. At first you seemed to be giving off a feeling of being a little repulsed. I just want to know if it\u2019s still there\u2026\u201d\u201cTell me later, Annette.\u201dWith a cold reply, he suddenly dashed forward. Embarrassed by his unexpected behavior, Annette looked at his back with her eyes wide open. At first, she thought Raphael was running away because he didn\u2019t want to answer her questions, but now he seemed to be chasing someone.Annette wondered who Raphael was chasing so hard. However, because of her short height and the crowded street, it was difficult to see anything. She didn\u2019t even know if it was a man or a woman. While Annette was struggling to catch up with him, Raphael slowly disappeared somewhere far away.\u2018Oh, he left me alone.\u2019Annette, who was left alone, drooped her shoulders. Raphael\u2019s cold-hearted attitude of leaving her alone on the street without any explanation was disappointing. It was even more so because she had finally mustered up her courage to seriously talk with him.Annette felt a little miserable because she felt neglected by him. A short sigh escaped out of her mouth, as she stared vacantly at the direction where Raphael had disappeared.\u201cHa.\u201dFortunately, it wasn\u2019t too far from where the carriage was parked. Since she was a regular at Tina\u2019s boutique, she was familiar with the roads here. But Annette\u2019s steps were strangely slow. A relationship without any progress; steps without progress. It felt like she had become a slow turtle.Annette ended up stopping a few meters away from the carriage. For some reason, she didn\u2019t want to go home like this. Just in time, a nearby white bench caught her eye. It was a high-end shopping street which many nobles frequented, so the benches here were neat and even a small fountain was placed beside them.Annette pondered as she gazed at the fountain with clear water gurgling out of it. It was nice to have a second chance in her life, but her self-confidence kept on dwindling these days. She wasn\u2019t sure if she could make good use of this opportunity.\u2018Can I change something just because I try?\u2019Annette was afraid that all of this was nothing but a joke of fate. What if all her paddling and struggling doesn\u2019t work? It was such a hopeless life that any effort only brought the same result as before. Annette bit her lip and somehow held herself up.\u2018But just because it\u2019s scary, you can\u2019t just do nothing.\u2019There must be a reason for her regression and this second chance. Annette decided to believe in herself. Anyway, there was no other way out now.Annette raised her drooping head, and got up from the bench. At that very moment, she was so surprised that she almost let out a scream. Annette clutched her chest and asked with a trembling voice.\u201cRa, Mister Railin?\u201d\u201cOh, you finally noticed me.\u201dRailin, squatting in front of Annette, laughed with his chin raised. She didn\u2019t expect him to suddenly pop out like this out of nowhere. Railin, who was taller than what she expected, was just right at the same eye level with her. Because of this, Annette was able to watch his pomegranate-like red eyes smiling thinly at her. Annette, who grabbed her startled heart, asked with dismay.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here? What can I do for you?\u201d\u201cWell, I came because I have something to do. In that sense, are you done with your meditation? If it\u2019s okay, would you like to take a walk with me, my dear customer?\u201dRailin, who smiled like a fox, got up and reached out to her. Annette hesitated for a moment but eventually took his hand. Railin\u2019s elegant, long fingers were surprisingly cold and soft. Railin naturally led Annette to the walking course and spoke lightly as if he was saying a mere hello.\u201cSo, have you made up your mind? Are you willing to start a new life?\u201d\u201cHuh? Oh, you\u2019re talking about the \u2018smuggling\u2019.\u201dAll the data investigations for her smuggling had already been completed. Annette simply had to decide where she would be staying and the duration of her stay. But it wasn\u2019t the time yet. Annette still had a lot of work to do here.\u201cI think I need a little more time for that. By the way, did you get the information I asked for?\u201dAnnette shrugged and brought up another topic. Railin smacked his lips as if he was disappointed. She didn\u2019t know why, but he seemed eager to get Annette out of the country. Is it because of the money?Railin\u2019s services, which secretly smuggled a person out of the country and forged his identity in the new country, were immensely expensive. In fact, the cost was worth it, considering the myriad of efforts that went into the process. However Annette had enough money to handle it. Nevertheless, when Annette changed the topic, Railin pretended not to have seen through her.\u201cYou said you were curious about your husband\u2019s iron ore mine last time, right? It\u2019s probably a mine located in the Calabria Mountains, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. How\u2019s his mining business now? Tell me everything you know. I\u2019ll pay for the information as much as you want.\u201dAnnette turned and looked at Railin. Her eyes, under the afternoon sun, were just as beautiful as a pink lace rose. Railin\u2019s lips, looking at this, held a quiet meaningful smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/How to Tame My Beastly HusbandChapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRailin didn\u2019t immediately tell her the information she wanted to know. He basically had a twisted personality. The more he liked something, the more mischievous he became. As a result, Railin slightly tilted his head and stabbed Annette\u2019s sore spot.\u201cBefore that, I want to ask you one question. Why don\u2019t you ask your husband yourself?\u201dAnnette smiled bitterly at Railin\u2019s question. She also wanted to ask Raphael directly. But she wasn\u2019t sure how Raphael would take it. If Annette asked him about the mine while her father was already eyeing it\u2026.. What misunderstanding would Raphael come up with?\u2018He would probably suspect that I\u2019m siding with my family and have my eyes on his mine\u2019.\u2019Raphael hated her family. But just as Raphael couldn\u2019t change his illegitimate status, even if he strongly hated it, it was the same for Annette. She hoped that Raphael would someday understand this and accept her for who she is. But realistically, it would be better for her to leave before that.For now, the road seemed quite far. The back of Raphael, who turned his back away and went somewhere, was still burned in her mind. Annette didn\u2019t respond to Railin\u2019s question and pursed her lips tightly.Annette\u2019s decision to not answer was quite intriguing. Railin, who wasn\u2019t used to being ignored, smiled a little deeper. He became even more interested because Annette was not an easy woman. Even if she shed a little of her colors, she was different from the women who he had met. That\u2019s why Railin was willing to bring out the information she wanted to know first.\u201cI was surprised. Your husband\u2019s iron ore mine is a good mine, accounting for 55% of the total mining volume of the Deltium. In the past, iron processing was too demanding, so its demand was low, and iron ore mines did not have much profits. But a lot has changed recently. Did they call it something like the so-called new era? Thanks to this, the value of the mine\u2019s assets is going up day by day. Sooner or later, it\u2019ll be irreplaceable, even more than the diamond mines.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u2026 Is that about it?\u201dAnnette was amazed. She also knew that the times were changing. The bronze rakes of the gardeners working in the mansion were now replaced with iron, and the scraper blade, which the maids used to scrape the dirt from the floor, was also replaced with shiny iron. But she didn\u2019t know that the change would be this big.The times were now changing and now in this world, iron tools were easily supplied to the common people. And Raphael was the man who held the key to that change. And that too a very big golden key.\u2018Did His Majesty, Selgratis guess this in advance and give Raphael an iron ore mine?\u2019Annette suddenly became curious about this. According to the rumours, King Selgratis cherished his illegitimate child, Raphael very much. Moreover strangely, he didn\u2019t talk much to Raphael but often compared Raphael with Ludwig, even in the public. Because of this, the sensitive and delicate Ludwig suffered great damage to his pride every day. It was inevitable for Ludwig to feel inferior to Raphael because of his father\u2019s blatant favoritism.\u2018At least if His Highness Ludwig was not this clumsy\u2026.. The situation would have been better.\u2019Annette sighed, recalling Ludwig\u2019s amazing luck, which made him stumble over his feet on his own. That\u2019s how clumsy he was, but his half brother, Raphael, was just as skilled and powerful as a Sword Master. Their situation could only be really summed up as a joke of parentage. This was why Ludwig looked at Raphael maliciously, full of jealousy.Anyway, she wasn\u2019t sure of anything right now. Annette tried to hide her surprise and maintained a calm face. Then, she posed the most important question to Railin.\u201cIf the mine is so valuable, there must have been a lot of offers for sale. Everyone wants to buy something valuable. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cYou are also wise. And the customer is probably curious about\u2026 whether that list includes the name of the Duke of Bavaria or not?\u201dRailin smiled thinly and looked down at her. With his back against the light, his face held a strangely erotic and dangerous feel. Perhaps that\u2019s why she always felt as if she was walking on a tightrope when dealing with Railin. Annette gulped and then resolutely raised her head to face Railin.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I wanted to know that. So please answer me. Did my family\u2026force Raphael to hand over the mine?\u201d\u201cAnswering your question, yes. It has been done many times. It\u2019s obvious that the Duke of Bavaria wants the iron ore mine.\u201dThe moment she heard Railin\u2019s answer, Annette felt as if her feet were sinking. Her ominous speculations came true. Her father, Allamand coveted his own son-in-law\u2019s iron ore mine. This was not simply a matter of increasing wealth. If you get your hands on a mine that accounts for more than half of the total mining volume of the Deltium, your political influence will increase exponentially. Allamand must have been trying to steal the mine from Raphael for this.Perhaps this had been the same case in her previous life. However, Raphael had never let her know about this either in her previous life or in the present. Despite the numerous quarrels and terrible arguments they had, he had never let out even a word about it. A single word of exclamation came out of Annette\u2019s mouth, who only realised this fact after her regression.\u201cOh My God!\u201dAnnette was so shocked that her footsteps naturally slowed down. She was stunned, not even realizing that there was a puddle near her feet. Just before Annette\u2019s fine sheepskin boots could fall into the puddle, Railin\u2019s arms wrapped around her waist like a snake. Unlike his pretty appearance, he easily lifted Annette with one arm.\u201cExcuse me for a moment.\u201dAnnette, startled by the contact of another man, returned back to reality. It was a short period of time, even less than a second, but Annette\u2019s body flew in the air like a bird. After safely crossing the puddle, Railin immediately dropped her on dry ground.\u201cOh my God, Mister Railin!\u201dAmazed, Annette exclaimed and unknowingly called out Railin\u2019s name. Just then he swiftly released the arm wrapped around Annette\u2019s waist. Railin looked at her as if asking, \u2018What happened?\u2019 and then laughed harmlessly.\u201cI was worried that the lady\u2019s feet would fall into the puddle.\u201d\u201c\u2026. Mister Railin.\u201dAnnette did not fall for his fox-like tricks. When she called out his name exasperatedly, he looked at her with an innocent smile. Annette was not agitated by this, but was rather intimidated.\u201cThank you for your consideration, but don\u2019t do this again. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cAs you wish.\u201dRailin raised his one arm and pretended to bow deftly. After seeing this, Annette finally sighed and laughed. He was a man who could fool people and come out of any problem as naturally as breathing. It\u2019s probably the result of a combination of natural wit, sense and charm.\u201cThank you very much for today, Mister Railin. I\u2019ll send the remuneration to the Secret Guild soon. Well then, goodbye.\u201dAnnette bowed her head a little and turned around. Her figure was just perfect and her etiquettes and manners were textbook perfect. Railin looked at her graceful back with admiring eyes. He was relieved to hear that the couple had a bad relationship, but it seemed that was not all to it. Her husband even accompanied her to the boutique today.Seeing Annette\u2019s back disappearing in the distance, Railin turned around, licking his lips. He had prepared something to comfort the wounded lady, but it was a pity that it was not yet the time to use it. What would be the final choice of this exciting customer? Railin was very curious.* * *\u201cOh, Raphael\u2026 Ugh! Please, slow down a little bit\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe pleas coming out from the hoarse neck were pitiful but they had a tendency to provoke a man\u2019s passions. Raphael gripped Annette\u2019s struggling white ass harder and lifted it up. Even with a little force, her body moved easily and was so sweet that it seemed like a sugar doll. Isn\u2019t it a foul to say that something so delicious could be so weak? All sorts of useless thoughts came into his muddled mind filled with lust.Raphael buried his desire between the wriggling buttocks, where his handprints were left red. A groan of ecstasy spilled out of his mouth, as if he was going into hot water. He wanted to make it a little more rough, fill her a little more, but he had to restrain himself because he was afraid to break her. Raphael grinded his molars hard.\u201cHeungg!\u201dAnnette sniffed and shook her head at the overly deep insertion. Raphael, who bowed his head behind her back, licked and bit her tear stained cheeks. At the same time, a huge object dug between her legs and poked deeply down there. Annette trembled as his penis plunged inside her warmth, cutting through her fragile folds and stabbing her sensitive spots in a row. A blinding sense of pleasure spread out.She felt like she was going to suffer a great shame if she went on like this. Annette unwittingly crawled forward, avoiding his hideous length. Then, without any mercy, Raphael pulled her slender wrist back, pulling her body closer to him. Because of this, his length thrusted inside her so strongly that it made a loud squelching noise.\u201cHah!! Ah!!\u201dThe movement of the penis going back and forth between her legs felt so good that she felt like she was going crazy. Annette could not think of anything now. She shed a few tears and unwittingly shook her waist. She hoped this dreadful pleasure would end as soon as possible. But then she heard a beastly growl from behind.\u201cWhere did you learn to be such a naughty girl?\u201dAt the same time, the movement of the penis poking from behind became more intense. The stinging exhilaration and pleasure spread throughout her body like a flame, pushing her further down into the abyss of ecstasy.The scent coming from the shaking body mingled with his breath, making his eyes flush red. Although her legs were not tightened properly around him, because of the pleasure, his huge penis pushed through the narrow inside as if it was dissatisfied.\u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a mess inside, Annette. You\u2019re dripping wet.\u201dRaphael whispered wickedly as he pushed his penis all the way in. He then pulled it out and his fingertips rubbed the edge of the vaginal mouth as it swallowed his desire again. Annette was so overwhelmed by this stimulation that she sobbed and cried pitifully. Because of this, the inner wall further tightened, making Raphael groan and thrust into her harder.\u201cUmm,\u2026nggh.. huh, ah!! Ugh\u2026 !\u201dThe thick penis fiercely rushed into her deepest part, crushing her weak spots. A cramp-like pleasure slowly engulfed her whole body. The body, which was already familiar with joys of carnal pleasures, greedily sucked up the penis and pursued the greater pleasure. Raphael\u2019s penis again penetrated her deeply, and his hard fingers rubbed the clitoris between her legs. At that moment, Annette reached her peak and convulsed while leaning back.\u201cKeeuk !\u201dAs if drawn by the strong tightening of her inner walls, Raphael thrusted inside her. He bit Annette\u2019s lean white throat, and pushed himself deeper inside her. His movements were overly primitive, just like a beast.Annette, who was lying on the bed, tiredly closed her eyes. She could feel the lingering cramps in her body but she was too exhausted to care about them. Sex with Raphael was good, but it was too stimulating. He was a man who didn\u2019t know the meaning of \u2018self-restraint\u2019. Thanks to this, after suffering for a long time, Annette\u2019s consciousness slowly faded away.\u201cAre you sleeping?\u201dRaphael frowned and gently touched Annette\u2019s wet cheek. She can\u2019t sleep yet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She grabbed Raphael\u2019s large hand, that was lightly stroking her cheek. Surprisingly, he went along with Annette\u2019s weak whims. Exhausted from their fierce love affair, Annette unexpectedly put her hand in his hand. The bold, intimate contact made Raphael feel embarrassed.Annette laughed a little. Raphael, who had so far done far more sexual and violent acts, seemed cute as he stiffly put his fingers over hers. But this time, she couldn\u2019t delay the \u2018conversation \u2018 anymore. Annette, holding Raphael\u2019s hands in hers, asked the question that she had been waiting to ask.\u201cRaphael, that person you followed today \u2026\u2026. Who was that person?\u201dRaphael said nothing. Annette turned her head and saw him tightly clenching his teeth. His manly chin held an oppressive power. It was one of his habits that he did whenever he was asked something that he didn\u2019t want to speak about. Sure enough, even after waiting for a long time, Raphael didn\u2019t answer anything.\u201cRaphael.\u201dAnnette sighed and quietly called his name. They were a couple now and were even more closer than before, but she still didn\u2019t know anything about Raphael. He was a very complicated person, so even a little slip of the foot could lead to stepping on a landmine.Annette was disappointed with Raphael\u2019s unwillingness to open up to her. But if he didn\u2019t want to say anything, she also didn\u2019t want to pry. However, it was necessary to say a word to him about the way he treated her. Annette pointed out his today\u2019s actions in a quiet tone.\u201cYou left me alone on the street today without saying anything, Raphael. I was so embarrassed. If you can\u2019t say much about it, then at least tell me why. You don\u2019t have to be specific, so can you tell me why you did that then? So that I can understand your actions.\u201dAnnette said as carefully as she could without mentioning the person whom Raphael had followed. Raphael apparently didn\u2019t want to talk about the person, so he didn\u2019t didn\u2019t want her to broach the subject.Annette was willing to understand him, even if he had given her a typical lame excuse like \u2018I needed to find a washroom urgently.\u2019 But, he seemed to have no intention of even doing that. Raphael coldly shook off Annette\u2019s fingers and got up from the bed. Then, he picked up his fallen clothes and began to put them on.\u2018So is everything again like it was before?\u2019Annette didn\u2019t say anything and looked at Raphael\u2019s back with darkened eyes. Whenever the distance between them seemed to narrow a little, it always turned out this way. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t even answer any of her questions. So she couldn\u2019t even ask him about what he thought of her. Annette was getting tired of this repeating pattern.\u2018If he doesn\u2019t want to open up to me and just wants a superficial relationship\u2026 I can\u2019t help it anymore.\u2019A relationship is built by the efforts of two people. One sided effort alone can not keep up a relationship. And Annette had no intention of ending her second life by trying to dig this dry well. It seemed she would have to visit Railin again as soon as possible. A new life in Osland may be a little lonely but it still had a possibility. A possibility of finding peace and happiness.At that time, Raphael, who was holding the doorknob of Annette\u2019s bedroom, turned to her side. His deep blue eyes raked over Annette\u2019s face. Even though she didn\u2019t say a word about his attitude, his heart still sank for no reason. Her darkened eyes and disappointed expression seemed to strangely hold him back.Perhaps that was why Raphael couldn\u2019t dash out of the room as he usually did before. He opened his lips to say something to Annette. But he had nothing to say. Raphael was a sceptical person and had too many secrets.\u2018No, I can never tell her this.\u2019His instincts growled, saying that he shouldn\u2019t expose his weaknesses. Raphael\u2019s mouth was naturally tightly sealed in response to the warning. He was already used to a life where no one could be believed. But now, he couldn\u2019t make an exception to Annette, who he had just married. To do so, the risk that Raphael would have to take was too great. Again, his choice eventually led to a refusal to talk.\u201cNext time, I\u2019ll tell you next time.\u201dRaphael somehow managed to answer while turning his back and then hurried out of her bedroom. He was annoyed by his pathetic appearance in front of Annette, as he could neither do this nor do that. Why do I keep feeling so pathetic in front of her?Annette quietly closed her eyes, feeling the chill from the closed door. Just this afternoon, they were happy, choosing clothes for the ball together. All of it now seemed like a lie. Life truly is a tragedy when seen closely, and a comedy from afar. The same repeating cycle made Annette feel suddenly distressed.* * *Since then, Raphael stopped coming into Annette\u2019s bedroom. Annette didn\u2019t bother to visit or appease such Raphael. The mansion of Marquis of the Carnesis fell into a heavy silence, and in the midst of all this, time flowed like water.Annette flicked her finger over the hard bandage. Now she wasn\u2019t sick or uncomfortable anymore. It seemed that it was almost time to remove the bandage. Annette called a maid and instructed her gently.\u201cDo you know the practitioner who looked at my fingers? Please call him back. I need to get a medical check up.\u201dAt that time, Annette was quite ill because of the inflammation caused by the fracture. So she didn\u2019t know which practitioner looked at her fingers. Fortunately, the maid remembered the person and soon called him in. The 30-year-old practitioner, with an elite face and chestnut brown hair, was quite memorable to her.\u201cMy greetings, Madam. Have you been doing well?\u201dUnlike his stubborn looking face, the practitioner still had a small fear. He looked around restlessly, breaking into cold sweats. He was actually looking around whether Annette\u2019s husband, one with a fierce face, was present there or not. Seeing that he was not there, the practitioner breathed a deep sigh of relief.This was a secret, but every time he was called here, he wetted his pants a little because of Raphael. The practitioner who had only studied all his life sitting at his desk until now, had a very delicate mind. Annette reached out to the practitioner with a vague smile.\u201cI think I\u2019m all better now, but I want you to see if it\u2019s okay to remove the bandage.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. Then let me see its status.\u201dAfter removing the bandages, the practitioner took a close look at her knuckles and then ordered her to do some hand gestures. Fortunately, Annette didn\u2019t feel much pain while following the movements. Seeing this, the practitioner nodded and took off his eye glass.\u201cOkay. I guess you\u2019re all better. However having a fracture once makes the bones more likely to break again, so be careful not to strain your hands for at least a month.\u201dHe finished his medical treatment, but instead of getting up right away, he hesitated. Annette looked at the practitioner with a wary look. She wondered if his fees for the medical treatment was overdue. But strangely, a completely different story popped out of the practitioner\u2019s mouth.\u201cWell, Madam. I gave a letter of introduction to your husband during my last visit. I was wondering if you have heard anything\u2026\u201d\u201cIntroduction letter? No, I\u2019ve never heard of it.\u201dUpon hearing Annette\u2019s answer, the practitioner nodded with a resigned look. The practitioner really did not have any expectations from Raphael. He took out another letter of introduction from his visit bag and said solemnly.\u201cI thought so, so I prepared one more.\u201dShould I give him a round of applause? Staring at the practitioner with a solemn face, Annette accepted the letter of introduction. The introduction letter, which was roughly scribbled with a doctor\u2019s unique bad handwriting, was hard to read. It was really difficult to understand its content. Deeply reflecting on this point, Annette somehow managed to read the name written in it.\u201cEucaly .Y. Cayun?\u201d\u201cYes. This person is one of my colleagues, and is also a woman. She\u2019s looking for a job now. Since she has left her hometown, she hopes to work as a doctor at a mansion where accommodation is possible. But, as you know, all the Deltium\u2019s nobles already have a family doctor. So it is hard for her to find a job.\u201dSo, he wanted to recommend his colleague to the Marquis of Carnesis, a newly-emerging aristocrat. Annette gently fiddled with the letter of introduction and lowered her eyelashes. The practitioner\u2019s explanation continued for a long time, but there was no need for her to hear it. Because Annette already knew the doctor named Eucaly.\u2018I can\u2019t believe I would intersect with her again in my life. Is it coincidence or fate?\u2019Annette, in her previous life, continued to suffer and eventually died. Originally, she was not very healthy and the mental stress caused by her terrible marriage and false charges worsened her illness. She started to become sick more and more frequently. The vicious cycle continued, and she eventually died five years after her marriage.Until Annette was seriously ill, she only called the practitioners when needed. Just like now. However, as her illness continued to become worse, a need for a doctor arose. The Marquis of Carnesis didn\u2019t have a family doctor like the other noble families. So, the last practitioner who was chosen for recruitment was Eucaly. Anyway Annette was the only one who was sick in this mansion, so it was much better to have a female doctor.\u2018But this time, fate made them intersect again in this form.\u2019Annette looked at the letter of introduction in a strange mood. She had no complaints about Eucaly. She was actually quite modest, and was always calm, and spoke carefully. Either way, it was a great advantage to keep her as a noble lady\u2019s doctor. Annette happily folded the letter of introduction and smiled brightly.\u201cLet me see. I\u2019ll call her. Thank you.\u201d\u201cYes thank you very much. Please take care of yourself. Well then, goodbye.\u201dThe practitioner hoped that Annette would contact Eucaly. The practitioner quickly packed his visit bag and hurried out of the mansion, without looking back. He was afraid that he would run into Raphael on the way.Annette, who did not know the feelings of the poor practitioner, looked back and forth at her free fingers. They had become slightly thinner and pale because of the bandage, but she knew they would return to their original state in a day or two. Annette smiled happily at the feeling of her comfortable hand.\u2018Now, I can wear a ring when I go to the ball.\u2019The garden party that the Marquis Eloque decided to hold was approaching soon. The matching dresses from Tina\u2019s boutique were also completed, so there was only one thing left to do. Should I appease Raphael and go to the party together with him, or would it be better to go alone?Annette\u2019s eyes drooped in thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/How to Tame My Beastly HusbandChapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018The day of the Garden Party has finally come.\u2019Annette sat in front of the dressing table and stared blankly into the mirror. Tina\u2019s dress, which was lying in one corner of the room, reflected on the clean mirror surface. The gorgeous skirt, embroidered with sparkling silver threads on a pure white background, fit together with the blue-violet colored bodice. The diamond necklace, which would adorn her collarbone, shone like a snowflake next to it. They were gorgeous and beautiful things that could make any woman\u2019s heart beat.But Annette sat in front of the dressing table with a pale face like a lifeless doll. She was being dressed up by the maids. Because of their skills, the woman\u2019s face in the mirror became brighter and more beautiful. However, Annette\u2019s heart, looking at this, had completely withered.\u2018Raphael probably\u2026 wouldn\u2019t go with me.\u2019In the end, they didn\u2019t reconcile at all. This time, Annette made no effort to mend their relationship. She neither smiled at Raphael nor spoke to him first and acted as if nothing had happened. She had finally realised that it was all a futile effort.Now whenever she reached out to him, Raphael did not shake her hand off. But sadly, that was all he did. He never made any efforts from his side. He never held Annette\u2019s hand or reached out to her first. And if Annette wanted to know more about him, he would coldly push her away. As if saying that this was the closest that she was allowed to be with him.\u2018It\u2019s okay. I can go to the party alone.\u2019Annette closed her eyes and made up her mind. For the first time in her life, she had been so excited to attend a party. It was all because she was going to attend the party together with Raphael. Now that all her expectations were smashed, it was heartbreaking, but that also didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t go to the party on her own. Regardless of whether Raphael went with her or not, this party was a must-attend event.Annette had planned to confront Celestine Keers there to see if she was the one who framed her. In fact, considering Annette\u2019s purpose, it was better to go alone than with Raphael. This way, it would be much easier to move around and achieve her purpose efficiently.Just in time, the maids finished applying a light rose-colored rouge on Annette\u2019s lips and then gave her warm compliments. It meant that all the preparations were finally complete.\u201cYou look really beautiful, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll be the most beautiful woman at the party.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAnnette smiled as she looked at her face in the mirror. The woman with a small face, big eyes, bright cheeks, and moist lips looked beautiful even to herself. With a familiar smile, the woman\u2019s face seemed happy at first glance.It would be okay to be alone. It has always been like that anyway.* * *Marquis Eloque\u2019s Garden Party was still very aesthetic this year. Beautiful lights were lit all over the garden covered in a dim darkness. Butterfly-shaped lanterns were lit on top of many branches, and lotus-shaped lanterns were lit on top of ponds and water basins, each giving off a subtle light. On top of that, the roses were in full bloom in the garden and gave off a deep fragrance, adding to the night\u2019s atmosphere.\u201cLady Annette! No, you\u2019re Marchioness of Carnesis now. I enjoyed your wedding. It was so beautiful! Welcome to the world of the married.\u201dMarchioness Eloque welcomed Annette as the host of the party. Being fifteen years older than Annette, she looked quite mild-mannered. Annette thanked her for the invitation and politely praised her for her thoughtfulness. However, Annette\u2019s eyes carefully examined Marchioness Eloque\u2019s face.Fortunately, there was no indication of any type of resistance or malice on her face. After seeing this, Annette was relieved and calmed down her heart.\u2018As expected, people don\u2019t know about my framed charges. The \u2018silence\u2019 is really thorough.\u2019The whole matter was silenced because of the cooperation between the Duke of Bavaria and the royal family. Even the victim, Celestine Keers, agreed to protect her honor. So the silence was bound to be perfect. If this thing leaked out, both Annette and Celestine would get hurt.Annette\u2019s handling of the whole matter was also excellent. It was a wise choice on her part to act as if she had fallen in love with Raphael at her wedding. She couldn\u2019t do that in her previous life, so people gossiped about it all the time. Why did she, the most perfect candidate for the crown princess, suddenly marry Raphael? Maybe there was some kind of flaw. Thanks to this, there were many rumors speculating whether she was infertile or had a promiscuous private life.However, people would easily accept the story of Annette falling in love with another man and not becoming the Crown Princess because of it. As long as the Crown Prince Ludwig did not publicly express his dissatisfaction with this matter, there was no particular factor that could cause problems for her in the social circles. Thanks to this, Annette was able to confidently come to the party which Celestine was going to attend.\u2018I wish Raphael had come with me.\u2019Annette smiled bitterly as she recalled the matching outfits that they had ordered from Tina\u2019s boutique. The Raphael she knew, mainly enjoyed wearing cold and dark colors. He preferred dark cobalt blue, navy blue, black, and dark burgundy colors. If he wore the white tailored coat this time, his beautiful chiselled face would have literally shined brightly like a lantern.But now these kinds of thoughts were useless. Annette looked around the party hall, trying to erase Raphael\u2019s thoughts from her mind. To prevent Celestine from avoiding her, she deliberately waited until the last minute to declare her attendance.The dress that Celestine was supposed to wear today, was a fresh lemon yellow in color. So, if she arrived at the party, she would stand out in the dark green garden. However, there was no sign of Celestine\u2019s figure anywhere.\u2018I guess she\u2019s going to be a little late.\u2019The higher the status of the lady, the later she appeared at a party. Although Celestine was still just \u2018the daughter of Marquis Keers\u2019, her case was little special. It was because she was going to become the Crown Princess. Now the treatment that she would get, would be somewhere in the middle of Lady Keers and the Crown Princess. Therefore, the chances of her coming a little late were high.Annette slowly walked around the party to avoid making it seem that she was waiting for Celestine. She greeted all the familiar faces. Fortunately, most of the nobles still had favorable opinions about Annette. It was all because they didn\u2019t know about her framed charges and the reason for her suddenly planned marriage.Instead of gossiping about her behind her back, they greeted her with big smiles and congratulated her on her wedding. They praised how perfect her wedding was and how beautiful the bride and groom looked that day. It was going well so far, but suddenly a very dreadful question popped out.\u201cBut where is your husband ? Didn\u2019t he come with you today?\u201dTheir curious eyes gleamed darkly at Annette, who appeared alone. With a bright smile on her face, Annette answered the question casually.\u201cAh yes. Actually, we were going to come together, but\u2026 there were some issues with the mine. As you know, his mining business is very busy these days. It would have been nice if we could attend the party together.\u201dAt times like this, she knew she had to answer naturally. The curious audience would not hesitate to throw her to the wolves, so she didn\u2019t give them what they wanted. Fortunately, Annette\u2019s decision worked well, again this time. Those who asked the question just nodded with a half-disappointed and half-convinced expressions.Just when Annette, who had passed the crisis safely, was about to leave, someone suddenly shouted her name out loud. Because of this, several gazes again fell on her.\u201cOh, Marchioness of Carnesis! I just saw you a few days ago, and now, here we meet again!! It\u2019s so nice to meet you!!!\u201dIt was Diana McClaire who called Annette. The daughter of Count McClaire was Celestine Keers\u2019 best friend and owned a fairly large business venture. She had met her the other day when she had gone to eat pork roast with Raphael and they even had a little altercation. Maybe that was why Diana approached her like this, bringing everyone\u2019s attention to her. It seemed she was again looking for a fight.Annette stopped walking and waited in a courtly manner for Diana to approach her. Now, she wasn\u2019t afraid of Diana. Annette, in fact, had already thought of this in her mind.\u2018Diana\u2019s presence certainly confirms that Celestine Keers would come to this party.\u2019That said, it was rare for someone to revoke their confirmation of attendance on the same day of a party. Since it was a basic courtesy to the party organizer. Perhaps that\u2019s why Diana\u2019s face, seeing Annette, shone with an extraordinary joy.\u201cSeeing that you attended this party, you must have heard that my friend Lady Celestine is also coming! Oh my, did you come here to congratulate her on her coronation in advance? How generous of you! After all, you were also a talented candidate that once competed for the same position with Celestine.\u201dAnnette\u2019s eyes trembled a little at her provocative words. Diana seemed to believe that Annette had a lingering regret of not becoming the Crown Princess. No, she wanted everyone to believe that. Last time she did the same before Raphael and laughed it off as if it was not a big deal and now again, she came at her in this way.Annette knew why Diana kept coming at her like this. Annette looked at Diana with some sympathy.\u2018Actually, she\u2019s the one who\u2019s envious of Celestine.\u2019Diana could quickly fall in love with men she didn\u2019t even know. In other words, Diana was a person full of delusions and fantasies. What she liked was actually not the men themselves, but her own fantasies. How attractive would be the position of a Crown Princess in the eyes of Diana, who had so many delusions?Ludwig was a good-looking man with long silver hair. So, to Diana, he must have looked like a prince from some fairytale. In fact, there were even rumors that Diana wrote a love letter to Ludwig when she was young.Perhaps she was very envious of her best friend, who would soon become the Crown Princess. However, harboring jealousy and envy towards your own best friend was morally unacceptable.\u2018So you\u2019re trying to attack me to defend your conscience by projecting yourself onto me.\u2019In short, Diana\u2019s hostility towards Annette was now her own jealousy towards her friend. She tried to relieve her guilt by attacking Annette after projecting herself onto her. So, Annette had no reason to be hurt by Diana\u2019s childish hostility. It wasn\u2019t like she couldn\u2019t understand Diana\u2019s feelings. But, Annette had no intention of playing the role of a punching bag for someone else.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/How to Tame My Beastly HusbandChapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAnnette was really annoyed at Diana\u2019s behavior. You should take care of your jealousy on your own, why do you have to drag someone else to play some role for you? It wasn\u2019t even a good role to begin with. Diana just wanted to project her own jealousy and inferiority on Annette. It was just absolutely detestable.Although Diana\u2019s level of arguing was somewhat cute, Annette didn\u2019t want to further develop this sick behavior. If she didn\u2019t take care of Diana now, she might go around spewing nonsense to others. Before her reputation could be damaged, Annette had to step on Diana\u2019s delusion. Annette smiled graciously and said,\u201cOf course, the two are a very good match. I can\u2019t wait to see their wedding. It will surely be a wonderful royal wedding just like those in fairytales. Wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\u2018This just comes up again and again! \u2018 Diana clenched her fists hidden under her gloves. Annette pretended to be unconcerned on the outside, but just like her, she sure must be jealous of Celestine, who was about to become the Crown Princess. If she couldn\u2019t help but be jealous of her own best friend, then how miserable must Annette be?Prince Ludwig, in particular, treated her very specially, to the point that there were even rumors that he liked Annette. The man who was wrapped around her finger was now going to marry another woman. Which woman in this world would be comfortable with this? Diana had no doubt that she was just acting that she wasn\u2019t bothered by this. So Diana tried to smile and hurt Annette.\u201cOh my, so you\u2019re looking forward to my friend\u2019s wedding! Celestine will be very happy to hear that. Celestine and I are really like sisters, so I can\u2019t help but feel grateful for all your kind wishes. Celestine will be here soon anyway. So how about you come with me and tell her what you just said yourself?\u201dDiana was so delusional that for a moment she completely forgot that Annette was above her in social ranking. Why is she not all bothered by this? Seeing that she was the only one who was caught up in the ugly jealousy, Diana\u2019s felt her mouth become dry. She somehow wanted to rip away Annette\u2019s elegant mask.\u201cOf course, you would right Lady Annette?\u2026. No, sorry, my bad! Now you\u2019re Marchioness of Carnesis!\u201dDiana thought that Annette would be uncomfortable with congratulating Celestine in person. Even if she gave a pretentious congratulation, that pretty face would sure become somewhat distorted because of the humiliation and jealousy. So she was sure Annette would somehow turn down her offer.\u201cThat\u2019s good! I really wanted to ask Miss Diana this. I\u2019m really grateful that you brought this up first. Thank you very much.\u201dContrary to Diana\u2019s expectations, Annette had come to the party to confront Celestine. But she also knew there would be a huge crowd of people around Celestine as people would try to get acquainted with the soon-to-be Crown Princess. So Annette was worried about how to approach her. But thankfully Diana offered to personally take her to Celestine.Annette concealed her smile and grasped Diana\u2019s hand in a more friendly manner. I would face Celestine no matter what! I\u2019ll make sure of it! Annette really wanted to talk with Celestine. Seeing this, Diana\u2019s pupils trembled greatly.\u2018This, what is this?\u2019As Annette held her hands, Diana could not do anything. She hesitated a little, but then suddenly, the entrance of the garden party became noisy, creating a small disturbance. After seeing this, Annette smiled and said.\u201cIt looks like Lady Celestine has arrived! Since you have said that you would take me to personally greet her, shall we go and say hello? We must not miss this opportunity to impress the future Crown Princess. Shall we?\u201dAnnette, with a graceful smile, grabbed Diana\u2019s hand. Diana, who was led by Annette, looked as if she was being dragged by the reins. The slender small woman pulled her towards the entrance and for some reason she couldn\u2019t push her off. Diana, who was accompanied by Annette in a hurry, quickly cleared her mind.\u2018No, maybe it\u2019s better this way!\u2019After all, two were better than one, and three were better than two. Since Celestine was her friend, she sure would take her side and help her tear off Annette\u2019s pretense. Diana, who had gone crazy at this point, hastened her steps and headed toward the entrance. Soon, Celestine\u2019s beautiful and rich dark brown hair will come before my eyes\u2026 Wait uh?\u2018Platinum blonde hair?\u2019Standing like a rock in one place, Diana looked dumbfounded. It was not Celestine who was surrounded by people and received people\u2019s greetings and flattery. No, it wasn\u2019t even a woman in the first place.The tall gentleman, with smooth face, and dazzling platinum hair, was a middle-aged man whose age was difficult to guess. A man radiating cold elegance from head to toe turned his head in her direction. As soon as she realized who he was, Diana felt a tingling in her head. Especially because she was attacking his daughter. Her feet became more numb.\u201cOh my God, your Excellency, the Duke of Bavaria, has himself come to this party!! It is truly an honor for us.\u201dMarquis Eloque, who ran out to the entrance, said in an exhilarating voice. His garden party was very good, but it was also a bit lacking to be considered as one of the best social events. And the Duke Allamand Bavaria, also known as the Blue-blooded Bavaria, only attended the best. So therefore, his sudden attendance was nothing short of the highest praise for the party organisers.\u2018I didn\u2019t hear that my father was also going to participate in this party.\u2019Annette took a step back from the crowd. Her face turned pale. Although she vowed not to live as her father\u2019s puppet in this life, she suddenly felt breathless.Allamand was a coercive and authoritative father. Under him, she lived obediently just like a chess piece. That life was imprinted deep in her veins. So she rather preferred to be prepared from the beginning. Now facing her father in such an unexpected manner, the fear that she had forgotten slowly crept out.After finishing his conversation with the host and some other key figures, he turned exactly their way. The Deltium\u2019s second most powerful noble following the king, stared at Annette with purple eyes without even blinking his eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, my daughter.\u201dHer father\u2019s blank face, which made it difficult to know what he was thinking, slowly smiled. Like a snake on the verge of suffocating its prey. The moment he met her eyes, Annette felt as if she was falling. Her feet were numb and she was so scared that her legs became completely soft. He looked so young that it was hard to believe that he had a married daughter. She suddenly felt goosebumps seeing his inhuman face.In the meantime, Allamand came and stood in front of her. The moment the flawless soles of his shoes stopped right in front of her, Annette finally came back to her senses. This was a battlefield and a lot of people were watching them. She couldn\u2019t afford to show any gaps in their relationship.\u201cHave you been well, Father?\u201dAnnette greeted her father perfectly just as as she was taught. Suddenly Annette\u2019s face had a soft spring like smile and her greeting was soft and smooth like flowing water. Even the angle of her waist and the placement of her fingers holding the dress, was flawlessly perfect.Allamand\u2019s violet eyes slowly glanced at such an Annette. His eyes were like that of a craftsman who was carefully checking the perfection of his work.\u201c\u2026..Yes. You must have been well, too.\u201dFinally, he reached out to Annette with a gaze that seemed to have completed his assessment. It seemed she had passed the excruciatingly long test. Annette raised her head and held her father\u2019s outstretched pure white hand in hers. His hands were so cold that she felt chills on her back.After finishing their greetings, Annette quickly tried to let go of her father\u2019s hand, but Allamand seemed to have no intention of letting her go. Her father, who was a perfect aristocrat down to his fingertips, tightly clasped her wrists as if squeezing out her breath. However, his face held a very fatherly smile, which was purely made to deceive others.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time. Let\u2019s talk.\u201dDiana had already disappeared somewhere, without even leaving a trace. So Annette couldn\u2019t use Diana to refuse her father\u2019s request. Allamand\u2019s tone was more friendlier than usual and his eyes sparkled strangely. It seemed that he was creating a misunderstanding for others.\u201cOh, did you hear the Duke\u2019s voice? It seems he\u2019s happy to see his married daughter again.\u201d\u201cNo matter how great the Duke of Bavaria is, he treats his own flesh and blood specially. It\u2019s surprising to see that he has a sweet side, too.\u201dNo, Allamand did not consider her as a daughter. He only thought of her as his possession, just a mere chess piece. Those who talked about him, only knew as much as the tip of an iceberg. They were not much familiar with Allamand\u2019s selfish nature. It was just like how they celebrated Annette\u2019s wedding without knowing anything.But only Annette knew what kind of human her father was. She had already planned to quit being his good daughter. Annette raised her head and with all her courage, she grasped Allamand\u2019s arm tenderly. She then slightly bent her eyes and pointed to the pavilion in one corner.\u201cThen, let\u2019s go that way. Father.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do that, daughter.\u201dAnnette had something to say to her father anyway. The moment they turned gracefully towards the pavilion, the grips on each other\u2019s arms tightened. Away from the people\u2019s gaze, Allamand\u2019s face returned to his cold expressionless look. He coldly sneered at Annette.\u201cYou look pretty confident. Now you don\u2019t look like you\u2019re ashamed of going anywhere and introducing yourself as a Bavaria. Earlier you used to be like a like a caught mouse.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to my father\u2019s teachings. What brings you here? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not here because you\u2019re curious about the rose garden of Eloque family. You don\u2019t even like flowers.\u201dAnnette did not fall for his provocation, but straightaway brought up the main point. Even though she had returned from the past, she still wasn\u2019t strong enough to beat her father. Therefore, it was more advantageous to hit the bull\u2019s-eye. Annette\u2019s lips trembled with tension, as she raised her head and stood up to her father.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The cigars he enjoyed were of the finest quality, that were delivered to the royal family, but it was only painful for non-smokers. Annette took a step back and turned her head. Her lungs seemed to be throbbing because of the heavy, bitter smell of the cigar.As always, Allamand smoked cigars for his own pleasure. He didn\u2019t care whether his daughter was suffering. It was a beautiful night party, but the only thing that passed between the two people was silence and a pungent smoke. By the time he smoked half of his thick cigar, Allamand spat out, as if he had suddenly recalled Annette\u2019s existence.\u201cWhy did you come alone?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s busy with his business..Ah.\u201dAnnette inadvertently blurted out the answer that she had prepared for the people she would meet at the party. For her, Allamand was an emotionally indifferent person. At that very moment, a thought came into Annette\u2019s mind. Annette, with her eyes wide open, asked Allamand.\u201cYou\u2019re here to meet Raphael, aren\u2019t you? How did you know that he was supposed to attend the party with me? What were you planning to tell him?\u201dAllamand gave no answer. He continued smoking the cigar, holding it between his bloodless lips. After seeing this, Annette\u2019s face distorted and she didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. At this point, it seemed that it was rather fortunate that Raphael didn\u2019t attend the party.It seems that Raphael did not properly inform Marquis Eloque of his intention to \u2018not attend\u2019. If he had, then Marquis Eloque would have removed his name from the last list of attendees. Then, Allamanda would not have come to this party.Of course, Raphael didn\u2019t know this, but he unintentionally stood Allamand up. No one in the entire kingdom of Deltium, not even the king himself, had ever stood Allamand Bavaria up. If Raphael had known this, he would have surely laughed ferociously, but unfortunately he was not here. Seeing that his purpose for coming to the party was out, Allamand threw the cigar away and laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s really worth it. Seeing you like this, I suppose that stupid bastard is doing well, hmm? Unlike his wild temperament, he really turned out to be a homely person. I\u2019m so proud to see that your drooping neck has finally gotten tough.\u201dAt her father\u2019s mocking words, Annette felt an unknown rage. He has been raising Annette like a doll since childhood, forcing her to obey him. But when Annette finally raised her head up and rebelled against him, he shrugged her off by saying, \u2018It\u2019s worth it.\u2019 His contradictory behavior made Annette feel sceptical about her childhood.Just like always, she was clueless about whether or not Allamand cared about her feelings. Crushing the remaining cigar under his feet, Allamand looked at her with cold serpentine eyes, as if trying to see through her heart\u201cHmm. Or is it the opposite? Maybe the bastard has been acting like your dog and you think you\u2019ve become stronger just because you\u2019re now living on your own. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk about my husband that way again. It\u2019s offensive. He does not need to be insulted like that.\u201dAnnette suppressed her anger and said in a low voice. She really didn\u2019t like the way Allamand looked down at Raphael with contempt. He talked about him as if he was mentioning a street bum. Naturally, a cold hostility appeared on Annette\u2019s face. However, Allamand only looked bored and dismissed her off as a little kitten showing off her claws.\u201cOh, it seems that my daughter has forgotten all her lessons.\u201dAllamand took a step closer to Annette, reached out his right hand and grabbed her shoulder. The cold, strong fingertips cruelly pressed on the dip near her scapula. As soon as Annette bit her lips in pain, a hissing threat, like a snake\u2019s whispers came into her ear.\u201cNow that you\u2019ve left the house, you\u2019ve become very cocky. How dare you side with that filthy bastard in front of me! Did you really think you can act all arrogant in front of me by relying on him? How dare you stand up to me.\u201dAllamand increased the strength in his hand, as if he wanted to dislocate her shoulder bones. Annette looked up at him, panting in pain.\u201cRaphael\u2026. It doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t swear at him. And I already know what my father wants. Whatever it is, don\u2019t even think about taking anything from Raphael. He\u2019ll never give it to you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you even know to talk like that? You don\u2019t know anything! You\u2019re nothing but a fool for taking the wrong side.\u201dAllamand\u2019s eyes gleamed with a cruel light. Even if he dislocated Annette\u2019s shoulder here, there was no one who could say anything to him. Even if there was, Allamand would only look back with a cold noble face as if it were nothing. He could easily get away with it just because he was Annette\u2019s father.Annette closed her eyes tightly, preparing for the upcoming pain. Her body trembled in fear. At that moment, a strong arm stretched out from the side and grasped Allamand\u2019s wrist tightly.\u201cTake your hand off my wife.\u201dBefore she knew it, Raphael came to her side and growled at Allamand with a fierce look. Not only his voice, even his grip on Allamand\u2019s arm, carried a tremendous weight. This time, it was Allamand\u2019s face which was distorted in pain.\u201cHow dare a filthy bastard like you touch my body!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t take your hand off Annette right now, this filthy bastard will break your arm, father-in-law.\u201dRaphael curled up the corners of his mouth and brought his face near Allamand. Enraged, Allamand twisted his wrist back and forth, but he couldn\u2019t beat the young and strong Raphael. As Raphael applied more force on his grip, Allamand groaned and took his hand off Annette\u2019s shoulder. Then Raphael threw his wrist away and strode towards Annette.\u201cAre you all right, Annette?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m all right. Thank you, Raphael.\u201dThe firm broad shoulders blocked her view of Allamand. As soon as she saw the strong, sturdy torso, she felt all her fears wash away. Even though Annette smiled bashfully, her face was terribly pale because of the pain. When Raphael saw her face, he clicked his tongue and caressed her cheek.\u201cAs soon as I take my eyes off you, you always get hurt. For a noble lady like you, you have a surprising clumsy side.\u201dAnnette smiled awkwardly. Seeing her smile disappear, Raphael regretted his words. If he had known this would happen, he wouldn\u2019t have been this harsh. He just couldn\u2019t figure out why he kept talking to Annette bluntly.Allamand, who was looking at this from a distance, gnashed his teeth. He was already angry at being insulted by his son-in-law, and now the two instigators were ignoring him and chatting with each other. The blue-blooded Bavarians could never stand being ignored by others. Especially Allamand, who had lived arrogantly all his life.\u201cThis is not funny at all. Are you going to act like a loving couple now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something you need to bother with. And isn\u2019t all this thanks to my father, who married me to Raphael?Annette, who regained her composure, replied in a soft voice. When Allamand decided to cover up Annette\u2019s charges for the sake of family\u2019s honor, he had to curry favor from the royal family. So he had no choice but to marry Annette off to Raphael, whom the king cherished. He never once asked about Annette\u2019s opinions or sought her consent in this matter.Annette sarcastically put this point before him, making Allamand\u2019s face distort with intense anger. His always indifferent and cold face finally revealed his teeth, and made him look somewhat human. At that very moment, poisonous words came out of Allamand\u2019s mouth.(T/N: Reveal his teeth-show hostility)\u201cYou seem to be getting along very well. So Annette, do you know how great your in-laws are?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026what are you trying to talk about?\u201dRaphael growled at Allamand, who suddenly attacked his family. Even though Annette was not used to Allamand\u2019s sarcastic remarks about Raphael\u2019s illegitimate lineage, she thought her father\u2019s words were a little different from usual. He wasn\u2019t being sarcastic about Raphael\u2019s parentage, but seemed to be trying to bring up something else.\u201cMy in-laws? Are you talking about His Majesty, King Selgratis?\u201dAnnette asked back warily. As far as she knew, Raphael\u2019s only relative was his father, King Selgratis. Very little was known about Raphael\u2019s mother, but it was clear that she was not from their world. So considering the situation right now, Annette\u2019s question made sense.But from her words, Allamand noticed that she had no idea what he was talking about. Allamand regained his composure, and a cold smile appeared on his face. With a look of sympathy, he put out the bait in front of her.\u201cOh, my poor daughter. You haven\u2019t heard anything from him yet, have you? What a wicked son-in-law! I can\u2019t believe he would completely cover up his embarrassing past by bewitching my pure and strong sweet daughter.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cThat wicked coachman who framed you\u2026 What was his name, yes! Was it Ivan?\u201d\u201cWhy are you suddenly talking about Ivan?\u201dFeeling an ominous premonition, Annette\u2019s voice began to tremble. Raphael looked puzzled as he looked back and forth between them. He didn\u2019t know what Allamand meant. Raphael was a man with many secrets, but he was not a skillful liar. If Raphael had anything to hide about Ivan, his face would have long given it away.Seeing Raphael\u2019s face, Annette collected herself together. She thought whatever words would come out of Allamand\u2019s mouth, he probably only said them to sway Annette. Even if it might be a shocking information, it was okay as long as Raphael wasn\u2019t cheating on her.\u2018It won\u2019t be a big deal. My father must be plotting something again.\u2019Annette struggled to face Allamand. She somehow stabilised her trembling chin and straightened herself up. Raphael put his hand on her shoulder as if protecting her. Allamand just looked at both of them with contempt. A chilling sweet voice came out from his pale bloodless lips.\u201cAhh my dear daughter, I guess you didn\u2019t know. Ivan\u2019s real name is Ben March. And he\u2019s also your husband\u2019s only maternal uncle. For you, he should probably be a distant uncle from the countryside.\u201dWhat the hell was he talking about? Annette\u2019s face turned white. She did have a vague feeling that Raphael\u2019s maternal side may not be from a noble lineage. But she never expected it to do something with Ivan. She just couldn\u2019t believe it. Raphael and Ivan did not have a single resemblance. Yes, there must have been some mistake.Annette turned her head and looked at Raphael. However, Raphael\u2019s face was also white. The moment she saw his complexion, Annette\u2019s heart sank. She asked stutteringly,\u201cThis, this\u2026 What does it all mean, Raphael? What does he mean, your\u2026 maternal uncle? Ivan is really\u2026your\u2026?\u201dUpon being questioned by Annette, Raphael\u2019s deep blue eyes froze. It was clear that there was some truth in this. What Allamand said was really true. The moment Annette realized this, something collapsed inside her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was a man who always kept up his noble appearance. He despised boorish people who could not conceal their emotions and laugh out loud in public. But this time he couldn\u2019t stand it. Allamand\u2019s eyes shone eerily with a bliss of hurting his enemy.\u201cWhat a great uncle-in-law! He helped his nephew by framing a princess that was beyond his reach, and then made her his daughter-in-law! Raphael, you must thank your uncle. If not, how could you marry my daughter? It\u2019s truly ridiculous!\u201dAnnette\u2019s body, listening to Allamand\u2019s mockery, stumbled forward. The mental stress accumulated from the confrontation with Allamand had reached its limit. Raphael, who was glaring at Allamand with his teeth clenched, embraced Annette\u2019s collapsed body.\u201cAnnette! Wake up!\u201dThe listless hands of Annette\u2019s drooping body trembled. Raphael, who did not even share a drop of blood with her, was very worried about her, but there was no agitation in the eyes of Allamand, who was her father. Allamand, blinking his thin eyelids, swept up his slightly disheveled platinum hair. And, with the tips of his lips curled up, he mocked Raphael.\u201cThe Marquis of Carnesis? What nonsense! If it wasn\u2019t for your talent, you would have been only Raphael by now. It\u2019s more suitable for you considering your vile bloodline. Go and make your uncle like your rat. Who knows? He might help you by blaming someone else\u2019s daughter.\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dRaphael vented his anger, but now was not the time to growl at Allamand. Raphael hurriedly took off his jacket, wrapped Annette\u2019s body in it and hugged her. The limp body in his arms was so thin that his chest tightened with unknown emotions.\u201cPlease be nice to my daughter. \u2018Someone\u2019 smeared mud on her and no one knows how to get rid of it. I wonder how long this little house play would last.\u201dWhen Allamand glanced at the fainted Annette, he turned his back and walked away. Raphael\u2019s eyes were blurred with confusion as he stood at the spot, hugging Annette\u2019s body. He was also quite mentally shocked right now.\u2018I thought he fell off a gambling board and died, but I never thought he was Annette\u2019s coachman.\u2019In fact, it was Ben who Raphael was chasing after leaving Tina\u2019s boutique last time. His sharp eyes somehow managed to find Ben mingling with the workers. It had been a long time since he had seen him again. Even after almost fifteen years, he still remembered Ben\u2019s face. Because he was one of the main protagonists of Raphael\u2019s dirtiest memories.Ben, his uncle, liked gambling, to the point it had become a serious addiction. So Raphael thought that he would still be living on a gambling table after suddenly disappearing. He had even thought that it was better he died there. But it turned out that Ben was working in the Bavarian House as Annette\u2019s personal coachman, under the fake identity of \u2018Ivan\u2019.He didn\u2019t know who recommended Ben for the position of the coachman of Bavaria. Somehow he became Annette\u2019s coachman, and then he shot her wings and dragged her to the ground to live beside a bastard.Although Raphael had no idea about all this, Ben was still his uncle. Even though it was disgusting, he couldn\u2019t deny the blood ties. Therefore, Raphael could not say that he was not responsible for the situation. Because it was true that he had benefited from marrying Annette because of the false accusation. Raphael\u2019s shocked eyes trembled.\u2018Not knowing that, I\u2026\u2019Until he first met Annette, Raphael thought she was a snob. \u2018How much did you want to be a princess, to kidnap and kill your rival?\u2019 And the fact that she was from Bavaria made him hate her more. He ridiculed her and looked down upon her.But Annette was nothing but a poor victim. She was falsely accused by his uncle Ben, and was married to his nephew, Raphael, who again subjected her to abuse and humiliation the second time. But still, Annette smiled warmly at him every time. Whenever others pointed their fingers at Raphael, she always defended him by saying \u2018He\u2019s a good man.\u2019Raphael was so distressed that he wanted to yell and vent out his feelings. But as long as Annette was in his arms, he couldn\u2019t do it. Her pale eyelids and still eyelashes were heartbreaking. Now by the time these eyes would open again, everything would be different.Annette will now no longer smile at him.* * *Annette sat by the sunny window and looked out quietly. It was the first time she had lazed around when the sun was up in the sky. She had just a thin piece of chemise and had let her hair loose. She even sat on a window sill, instead of a chair. \u2018Well, now since I\u2019m supposed to be a patient, who would bother me about it?\u2019Last night\u2019s garden party was like a beautiful hell. Annette, who had fainted, was carried out in Raphael\u2019s arms. The host, Marquis Eloque was surprised to see her like that, but he believed in the excuse that she was sick. The excuse worked well because she actually looked very sick and pale. It was fortunate that there were no strange rumors.The scenery beyond the window was beautiful. Everything in sight glistened under the golden sunlight. The green grass swaying in the wind, the yellow and purple flowers blooming in clusters. Even the hem of the new white skirts of the maids who were busy rushing around with their chores, were full of life. Only Annette was dull and spiritless, left all alone here.\u201cMadam, try a bit of the soup. Yeah? This will only hurt your health more.\u201dNext to her, Annette\u2019s maid, Mary pleaded with her. Annette rolled her eyes and looked at the bowl of soup she held. She didn\u2019t have any appetite, but the word \u2018health\u2019 caught her attention. For Annette, who had died so young in her previous life, there was nothing more effective than this word.\u201cGive it here and just go. I will eat it.\u201d\u201cYes, madam! Please call me if the soup gets cold while eating. I\u2019ll boil it warm again!\u201dMary\u2019s face lit up when Annette said she was going to eat. She handed Annette a tray of soup and left the room. Finally alone, Annette scooped two or three times, but as expected, her stomach didn\u2019t accept it well. Annette put her spoon down casually, closed her eyes and enjoyed the cool breeze. There was only one thought in her mind.\u2018I want to leave this place.\u2019When she saw Raphael\u2019s face that day, she knew he didn\u2019t know anything about this matter. After all, it hadn\u2019t been long since he had become an aristocrat. Moreover, because Raphael didn\u2019t socialise much, Annette had little contact with him until their marriage. So Raphael had no idea about Annette\u2019s personal coachman.But she couldn\u2019t forgive everything just because he didn\u2019t know. A lot could have changed if he had told Annette even a word about his biological mother and his maternal family before. He had an opportunity to speak, but Raphael remained silent to the end. He didn\u2019t believe in Annette, so he didn\u2019t tell her anything about himself.And the result came back to them in such a dramatic boomerang. Ivan, the man who had sent Annette to hell, was actually Raphael\u2019s maternal uncle. What kind of cheap third-rate play is this? Annette imagined herself politely calling Ivan, \u201d Uncle-in-law\u201d. Then a dejected laugh came out from her lungs.\u201cHaha, ha\u2026 ughh, hmm\u2026hmm\u201dIt didn\u2019t take long for the squeaky laughter to soon turn into crying. Annette had died young after living a passive life and being swayed by others. So in this life, she tried to change herself somehow. She even thought it was going well.But she was still being played in the clutches of fate. She felt like a mouse, who believed it was moving forward as it ran round and round in a wheel. Annette cried again and again because of her unending despair.\u201cUgh\u201dStrangely she felt a little refreshed after shedding a few tears. Annette rubbed her wet eyelashes and raised her head. Then, facing the garden, she leaned her head against the window, but somehow her eyes fell on Railin. Just in time, Railin, who was looking over here, smiled and said innocently.\u201cOh, you must have cried.\u201d\u201c..? \u201cWhy are you out there? Annette sincerely wanted to ask. No matter how many illegal things the information guild did, this was too much. To intrude into an aristocrat\u2019s mansion! However, Railin, who pretended to be innocent, looked very impudent.\u201cYou\u2019re not as surprised as I thought. As expected of my client.\u201dNo! Annette was so surprised that she was speechless. She wanted to ask how he managed to get through the security and come to the terrace of her room. But she didn\u2019t have to ask. At first, she didn\u2019t know because it looked so good on him, but Annette\u2019s eyes belatedly discovered the clothes worn by Railin.\u201cIt\u2019s a maid outfit. That too of our mansion.\u201d\u201cYeah. The fabric is of high quality. A family that knows how to invest in the servant\u2019s outfits will never fail. It sure is a place that knows what true aesthetics are. I am very impressed with the high views of the Carnesis family.\u201dAnnette wasn\u2019t happy with his praise at all. Railin jumped off from the windowsill and looked around. Following his graceful movement, the skirt of the maid\u2019s suit fluttered. He was a fine adult man, but she wondered why a maid\u2019s suit suited him so well. There was even a frill headband sitting on Railin\u2019s gorgeous purple hair.The tears clinging on her eyebrows fell down her face when she saw this amazing look. She sighed and touched her forehead. Why am I thinking about such trivial things in this situation? No matter how amazing Railin was, he could not give her more impact than Raphael\u2019s uncle. It was a shocking identity that she could never even imagine!\u201cCome and sit down. Since it\u2019s a sudden visit, I can\u2019t serve you tea.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an honor, Madam.\u201dRailin grabbed the hem of his skirt and greeted somewhat like a real maid. Then, he walked lightly like a cat, and sat opposite to Annette. With his chin in both hands, he looked up and down at Annette, bent his eyes and laughed.\u201cYou look so free today. Did you change your mind? For example, would you like to leave in search of more freedom?\u201dAs expected, he was a quick-witted man. He easily grasped that Annette wanted to leave. Annette opened her mouth while looking at the mole on the side of his mouth.\u201cI would like to live in Osland\u2019s Seylon area. It\u2019s near the beach, and it\u2019s a pretty big city. Most of all, I like the fact that there is a lot of translation work. It\u2019s probably because there are many foreign merchant ships entering and leaving the port.\u201d\u201cOkay. If so, what date would you like to pick?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s currently a bit difficult to set a date. There\u2019s one more thing that I have to deal with here, and it has to be done soon.\u201dAnnette said vaguely. All the preparations for the smuggling were completed, and she also had quite a bit of cash. So now, she could leave anytime she wanted. Nevertheless, there were two reasons for Annette to remain here. One was her lingering feelings about her marriage to Raphael, and the other was her determination to clear herself of all the false charges.The former reason could no longer hold Annette back. Annette was now tired of the high walls around Raphael\u2019s heart, which would never let anyone in. But, the latter case was different. Annette has not yet lost her will to prove her innocence. She had to meet Celestine Keers and say her piece of mind.\u2018Come to think of it, I didn\u2019t see Celestine at the party.\u2019Annette frowned as she realised this quite late. The presence of her father, Allamand, was so great that she completely forgot about Celestine, who was said to arrive soon. After all she had gone to the party to meet her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Allamand was still as cold and selfish, as she remembered. Raphael\u2019s broad back, which stood up against Allamand, covering her sight, was so strong that it moved her to tears. Because it was the first time someone had protected her like that.Annette still felt heartbroken when she thought of his back. But this didn\u2019t mean she could forgive Raphael. He had not only completely concealed his maternal family from Annette, but also mocked her for what his family had done. Even though she knew he didn\u2019t know about it, she still couldn\u2019t forgive him.\u2018I hate him.\u2019She hated Raphael for not opening his heart to her. She hated Raphael for not believing in her. No matter how many times she reached out her hand to him, she hated Raphael for not holding it. Annette bit her plump lower lip and tried to control this complex swirl of emotions. At that time, an unknown hand suddenly touched her long blonde hair.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dAnnette, who was pulled out from her complex thoughts, frowned and looked at Railin. Then Railin took his hand off and shrugged his shoulders.\u201cIt was so shiny that I couldn\u2019t help but touch it.\u201dIt was a shameless answer, as if asking what was wrong in doing this. Railin\u2019s thoughts behind that touch was nothing more than petting a cat. The touch did not have any sexual feeling, but was rather a simple touch full of curiosity.But Annette couldn\u2019t stand this and watch Railin do whatever he liked. She parted her lips to berate him. At that moment, Railin shut her mouth in a very effective way. Of course it wasn\u2019t a kiss, instead Railin took out some very interesting information and waved it before Annette.\u201cOh yeah. I visited like this today for business. Of course, it is our pleasure to find the information requested by our customers, but this is nothing. If you are a competent guild like our \u2018Secret\u2019, you have to provide more advanced services. For example, finding and presenting the information first, even before the customer tells you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019ve brought information that I\u2019m interested in? What kind of information is that?\u201dIn Annette\u2019s head, Allamand\u2019s and Raphael\u2019s faces passed by simultaneously. These two men were the ones who bothered her the most right now. But a different name popped out of Railin\u2019s mouth.\u201cThis is the information regarding Lady Celestine Keers.\u201dThe moment Annette heard the name, Annette realised that she had already been tricked by Railin. It was the type of information that she couldn\u2019t help but buy. But how did you know I\u2019m interested in Celestine? Annette, hiding her wariness, deliberately asked him back with an indifferent expression.\u201cWhy do you think I would be curious about her? Everyone is just mistaken that I still regret not being the Crown Princess. But the truth is I am already married, and I have no feelings for Your Highness Ludwig.\u201d\u201cOf course, you have no feelings for Prince Ludwig. But not even for Lady Celestine?\u201dRailin didn\u2019t fall for her acting and smiled charmingly. There was nothing this man didn\u2019t know about. Annette realised that she couldn\u2019t beat Railin in this regard. He knew how to play this game much better than her.Even if she asked him how he knew she was thinking about Celestine, she knew Railin wouldn\u2019t tell her. Dealing with him was like playing with the devil. Annette admitted coolly, pushing one of her stray blonde strands behind her ear.\u201cOkay, I\u2019m interested. I\u2019ll buy it, so tell me. What do you know about Celestine?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a wise customer, that\u2019s why we are always on the same page. Let\u2019s see. Here we go\u2026\u2026\u201dRailin deftly pulled out a thin file folder from under the maid\u2019s skirt. \u2018Why the hell is that coming out of there?\u2019 Annette took the file folder and turned the page with a slightly unpleasant expression. She felt absurd feeling the lingering lukewarm temperature on the paper, but she didn\u2019t much bother about it. Annette, who had quickly swept through a few sheets of paper, was lost in thought.\u201cShe has become sensitive and nervous. I guess the rumors about Celestine are indeed true.\u201d\u201cYes. People gossip that she pretended everything to become a princess. When she finally got what she wanted, she showed her true colors. Everyone seems to be displeased with the fact that the future Crown Princess would come from a humble family like the Keers. The contents weren\u2019t very good.\u201d\u201cOh my! The higher a person climbs, the better the arrows of envy would hit. Who\u2019s been spreading these words?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Diana McClaire. Well, even if I don\u2019t tell you who it is, you know her very well.\u201dHearing Diana\u2019s name, Annette lowered her eyes and laughed ridiculously. What kind of woman is she? She always attacked her by using Celestine as her friend, but she also publicized Celestine\u2019s faults behind her back.Anyway, the information Railin brought was quite informative. Especially the last part.\u201cSince then, she has turned very religious. Well, that\u2019s right. I do remember smelling the scent of the temple\u2019s perfume from her. By the way, it seems that she has been going to the temple more recently. I guess that\u2019s why she almost stopped socializing, and instead preferred to visit a temple. Let\u2019s see, the name of the temple she goes to\u2026\u2026 it\u2019s the temple of Odessa Louis.\u201dAnnette realized that this was a highly reliable and high quality information. Celestine Keers barely had been socializing these days. She expected her to come to Marquis Eloque\u2019s party, since she was close to them, but she couldn\u2019t meet her there.Because of this, Annette was very frustrated. Since she was framed as the perpetrator who caused damage to Celestine, it was impossible for her to go to Keers Mansion. Therefore, she needed something new. A very bold and innovative method.Railin observed Annette as she immersed herself in the papers. The bandage had been taken off and Annette\u2019s hand was now completely bare. The sight of her pure white fingers turning the papers somehow stimulated the man\u2019s sensuality. The combination of golden eyelashes, a pure white face, a narrow nose, and plump lips was so perfect that he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her. Perhaps that\u2019s why Railin suddenly praised her unexpectedly.\u201cYou are a very beautiful woman.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dAnnette\u2019s rose petal-like eyes narrowed, as if warning. Earlier, everything happened too suddenly, and Railin was wearing a maid\u2019s dress, so she didn\u2019t feel any threat. In fact, anyone would feel embarrassed rather than threatened on encountering a man in a maid\u2019s uniform.But when she heard Railin\u2019s praise, the wariness and alertness in her was awakened again. No matter how pretty he was, it didn\u2019t change the fact that he was a man. She was now sitting alone in a bedroom with a man other than her husband. Annette put down the papers she was holding with a loud thud sound and dismissed him in a firm tone.\u201cI will send the remuneration to the guild. I\u2019d like you to leave now. Thank you for your work, Mr. Railin.\u201d\u201cHoho! I see you have a habit of kicking people out on hearing compliments. Well, I was just about to get up. I hate dogs.\u201dWith a small shrug of his shoulders, Railin rose from his seat. Annette was grateful that he left quietly without making any trouble, but at the same time, she was also puzzled. Dog? Why is he mentioning dogs all of a sudden? As much as Annette knew, the Marquis of Carnesis didn\u2019t have any dogs.However, Railin seemed unwilling to answer any question. As he walked towards the window, he lifted the hem of his skirt and greeted lightly.\u201cThen see you next time. Until then, do not cry and stay healthy.\u201dRailin, with a playful smile, jumped down the window. Annette was so surprised that she almost got up and screamed. But when she looked down the garden through the window, there was no one there. Neither Railin nor any fluttering maid\u2019s outfit.\u2018He\u2019s really a ghost.\u2019Anyway, it seemed that Railin had left safely, so Annette breathed a sigh of relief. For a moment, she thought he was committing suicide, so she was very furious. The corpse of a man dressed as a woman after jumping down the window of a noble lady! Just thinking about the aftermath made her head ache. Just then, all of a sudden, Annette\u2019s bedroom door burst open.\u201cAnnette!\u201dIt was none other than Raphael who had come in with a fierce face. He looked relieved as he confirmed Annette was safe with his eyes. Then he started looking around the room as if looking for someone. From his face, it could be seen that he was convinced that someone was here. But no matter what, he would not be able to find Railin, who had already left.\u201cAnnette, tell me. Did anyone break into this place?\u201dRaphael asked as he stood before her like a beast whose territory had been invaded. Annette shook her head as she watched him take a step. Then Raphael approached her and looked down at her face as if he was trying to pry her open.\u201cSurely, I felt a strange existence here. There\u2019s no way I could be mistaken. You really haven\u2019t seen anyone, Annette?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnnette replied with a pale face. It was painful to face Raphael like this without any preparation. As far as Annette knew, Raphael would continue to question her until he got the answer he wanted. He didn\u2019t care if it made her uncomfortable or not. That was how he was in her last marriage.Annette was now completely exhausted. In this life, she tried hard not to have such a relationship with Raphael again. However, everything was ruined again. Annette looked up at Raphael, with her heart tightly closed like a clam. This time, no matter how much he pushed her, she wasn\u2019t going to say anything. The moment Raphael\u2019s eyes met Annette\u2019s, a troubled look passed over his face.\u201c\u2026..Okay\u2026If you say so. Sorry for coming in like this. Take rest.\u201dAnnette doubted her ears. Did such words really come out of Raphael\u2019s mouth? He even apologized for coming in freely. Annette wondered whether she had heard it wrong. But Raphael really turned his back and left her bedroom. The back of his drooping shoulders looked strangely small.Annette, who was left alone in the bedroom, somehow felt strange. She couldn\u2019t understand Raphael\u2019s unusual behavior. But she also didn\u2019t want to think about it. She was really tired of torturing herself with hope.\u2018Good. Let\u2019s think about meeting Celestine Keers.\u2018Annette sitting on the table looked down at the document. Just in time, an idea came into her mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Especially if he has a fine skeletal frame. The line from the nape of the neck to his broad shoulders and from the firm back to his slender waist was too beautiful to look at. Whenever the body moved a little, the elastic muscles wriggled accordingly, creating sensual expectations in the spectators. But every time Annette looked at this back, she wondered.\u2018Why do I see his back often these days?\u2019Whenever she looked down from her bedroom window, there was that back. Whenever she looked out, while drinking tea in the drawing room, there was that back again. Even when I\u2019m reading in the garden, with a turn of my head, I can\u2026.. I don\u2019t think I needed any further explanation.Annette wasn\u2019t very pleased with this situation where she had to constantly encounter Raphael\u2019s back. Their relationship was quite different from other couples, so even if a small conflict arose between them, it could not be resolved through simple conversations. To be precise, Raphael just stubbornly refused to communicate. In this situation, there was nothing good in bumping into him again and again. So Annette took her eyes off his back and walked away. Somehow, it feels as if his shoulders drooped a little more than before, but I guess it\u2019s just his mood.Annette returned to the room and spread open several books on the table. All were books related to religion and temples. She read each and every line of the books very carefully.\u2018If I go to the Temple of Odessa Louis, I may encounter Celestine.\u2019Last time, she couldn\u2019t meet Celestine at the garden party of the Marquis of Eloque. It was because she also hadn\u2019t attended the party that day. It was actually considered very rude to suddenly cancel attendance on the very day of an event. Especially if it was done by a \u2018distinguished guest\u2019 who will soon become the Crown Princess. This behavior was highly looked down upon. Celestine knew this too, then why did she do this?Nevertheless, since Celestine did this, many nobles resented her, as they had attended the party only to meet her. Annette had no idea about this and naively thought that she couldn\u2019t meet her because she ran into her father on the way and fainted from the shock. Annette, who now learned of Celestine\u2019s absence, suddenly came up with a question.\u2018Is Celestine avoiding me now?\u2019If Celestine was really the real culprit behind that little self-made play, it was understandable that she was avoiding Annette. When she got what she really wanted, it seemed that she felt guilty. If not, she would not have avoided Annette or been afraid of being found out for what she had done. After all she wasn\u2019t the type of person who could manage her facial expressions.Well, either way, Annette wasn\u2019t very happy. It didn\u2019t matter if Celestine was really trying to avoid her. She would somehow meet her and confront her. Even though she was satisfied for not becoming the Crown Princess, it also didn\u2019t mean that anyone could trample all over her. And that too, to the extent that she was forced to walk down a path in which she didn\u2019t want to step her feet on. Annette\u2019s eyes, as she looked at the books on the table, became more sharp.~Whoosh!Annette took her eyes off the book and looked outside the darkened window. Because she was so focused, she even lost track of time. As she stood up, rubbing her dry eyes, Annette suddenly found an invitation on the sofa.\u201cHmm? Was there something like this here earlier?\u201dCuriously, Annette picked up the invitation and looked around. It was an invitation to a party held by Count Lucini. The party who had sent this invitation and the content of the invitation were quite ordinary. But there was one peculiar thing in it.\u201cCouple attendance party.\u201dAfter reading the last line, Annette harshly wrote \u2018not attending\u2019 on it and put it on the table. Later, if Mary, the maid, found it, she would convey her rejection to Count Lucini. Believing so, Annette lied down on the bed with a relaxed mind. There won\u2019t be many days to sleep here now.* * *Raphael leaned over the glass, nestling in the sofa with a dark look. Every time his bent neck moved, a strong liquor flowed down his throat. A generous gentleman, looking at it from the opposite side clicked his tongue.\u201cDrink slowly. If you keep going like that, it might go through the wrong pipe.\u201d\u201cJust leave me alone, old man. I just want to get drunk right now.\u201dRaphael rubbed his wet lips with the back of his hand and replied harshly. At first glance, it could be seen that he didn\u2019t really want to get drunk. It seemed that there was a big problem. Well, if it wasn\u2019t for that, Raphael wouldn\u2019t visit him in the first place. The old gentleman shrugged his shoulders, stroked his chin and then asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? I thought you were doing well. You\u2019re just about to become a Sword Master and you even got a beautiful wife. Do you know how popular Princess Annette Bavaria was in Deltium? Everyone thought she was going to be the Crown Princess, so they all were eager to suck her fingers. But you ended up being the one who actually snatched her. Haha, you lucky bad guy.\u201dThe old gentleman deftly tiptoed towards Raphael. There was an unpleasant furrow between Raphael\u2019s thick eyebrows. After seeing this, the old gentleman quickly noticed the problem with Raphael. He wondered whether he was troubled with something related to his marriage. As soon as he realised this, the old gentleman\u2019s mouth rose in a graceful smile.\u2018Oh my Goodness, this arrogant brat is worried about his marriage! \u2018It was truly awesome. The old gentleman had been watching Raphael since he was young, but he never thought he would have such a fun time. It was a matter that he had to himself unfurl and see. However, there was also a high possibility that Raphael would immediately kick him in a fit of anger if he caught what he was thinking. So the old gentleman subdued the rising corners of his mouth and asked solemnly.\u201cWhy? Does your wife hate you?\u201d\u201cWho hates me\u2026!!\u201dRaphael\u2019s bellowing voice didn\u2019t finish what he was going to say. He was aware that he was in a position where he was hated by Annette. Their marriage started pretty badly, but it still went pretty well. And all this was purely because of Annette\u2019s efforts. Raphael was not really aware of this. No, he just pretended not to know.However, now Annette stopped trying. She neither smiled at him anymore, nor did she ask him how he was doing in her sweet voice. Raphael couldn\u2019t accept it and kept hovering around her. But no matter how much he lingered around Annette, she never spoke to him like before. She even turned away the invitation to the couple attendance party that he had secretly sneaked in!\u2018I really liked it when you asked me to go to a ball with you.\u2019This time Annette seemed determined to completely turn her back on him. As soon as he realized this, his heart sank. He even felt a profound sense of despair as if he was sinking down into the deep sea.So he was very confused. He was confused about so many things; why he was so desperate now, what Annette meant to him, and how to unravel these tangled and twisted threads. This was why Raphael came to find the old gentleman standing before him.\u201cTsk. Tsk. It\u2019s pretty obvious why your wife hates you. You must have again lost your temper at her. Especially since she\u2019s the daughter of the Duke Allamand Bavaria whom you hate so much. I\u2019m sure you must have done everything to hurt her. Well, let me guess what you must have said. A woman like you must have been really upset because you couldn\u2019t be the princess, or you Bavarians are so cunning.\u201d\u201cHarold!\u201dRaphael, who was stabbed in the sore places, shouted in a fit of temper. If it was complete nonsense, he wouldn\u2019t have been this angry. But he couldn\u2019t ignore Harold\u2019s age and his words were all correct, so Raphael felt more crazy.As Raphael\u2019s blue eyes glared murderously, the old gentleman named Harold shrank back as if he was scared. However, the corners of his lips gave him away as he couldn\u2019t hide his smile filled with joy. In the first place, Harold was one of the few people who Raphael couldn\u2019t scare.Raphael knew this very well, so he eventually slackened his shoulders and sat down. There was a look of distress on his indifferent face. Then Harold, with a little cough, asked in a serious tone.\u201cOkay, have you apologized to your wife?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d\u201cHuh? You haven\u2019t apologized yet? Tsk, tsk, you\u2019re still full of arrogance. I don\u2019t have any advice for a birdbrained person who can\u2019t even apologize to his wife.\u201dHarold looked at Raphael with a pathetic look and shook his head. Then Raphael became furious, but soon that anger was replaced with distress. A weak murmur came out of his lips.\u201cThat\u2019s not the problem, old man. It\u2019s really complicated. If I want to apologize to Annette, I have to tell her everything about my biological mother.\u201dRaphael\u2019s jaw, as he pronounced the word mother, became strained. He looked pained, as if he was holding back his nausea. Annette was a clever woman and Raphael wasn\u2019t confident to come up with an excusable story in front of her. Eventually, he would have no choice but to bring out the story of his mother, who was connected to his uncle.Raphael vehemently hated his mother and his maternal lineage, to the point If anyone found out about it, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill that person by any means possible. This was why he couldn\u2019t tell Annette about it. He would rather keep his mouth shut, even though he knew it would make her sad.\u2018I could have been more honest with Annette if it wasn\u2019t for my damn bloodline.\u2019Wait a minute. But why do I care so much about her? Raphael realized something was wrong. Come to think of it, it wasn\u2019t the first time he had thought like this. The insignificant thoughts, that came every time, were piled up in one side of his mind and kept on piling up, to the point he felt like a complete new existence. He also felt as if his body had become bigger than before.In the first place, he had never thought about all this in his own initiative. Just in time Harold asked Raphael a question in a heavy voice.\u201cWhat about you, then? Do you love your wife? Are you willing to take the risk and tell her your secret someday?\u201d\u201cLove? That\u2019s not gonna happen\u2026\u2026.\u201dRaphael\u2019s words, as he laughed cynically, suddenly stopped. I love that Bavarian woman? What ridiculous bullshit! But why can\u2019t I say no? Raphael closed his eyes tightly and tried to open his mouth.T/N: (Long review/rant whatever idk what to call this. So if you don\u2019t want to read it you can skip this).I really do enjoy reading your comments and take on the characters. So I thought why not put mine too.What I really love about this novel is that none of the characters are perfect like how main leads should be in a novel. They have flaws that I can relate to, which makes them more than characters of a novel to me. And there is no cheating or anyone getting in between the leads in the novel. It\u2019s a story about two flawed people and how they ruined each other because of their misunderstandings.Annette is one of my favorite protagonists. Even though she has been used and discarded, she still stays strong and is a kind hearted person. Someone said she hasn\u2019t tried enough. Well I would like to disagree with that. What I really like is that author kept her character constant even after her regression. For a person who had lived her whole life passively, it\u2019s difficult to suddenly change yourself. She did try her best as you can see in this chapter. Even though her efforts were small but I think that\u2019s the best one can do towards a person who does not respond to your affection or efforts. She knows Raphael doesn\u2019t love her, but she still tried her best to improve their relationship. When she got her second chance, she gave her relationship with Raphael another try because of their last moments in her previous life. But seeing that their marriage was going down the same path, no matter what she did, she gave up. She just wanted to live her second life peacefully with her loved ones. So why should she waste her second chance tormenting herself in a loveless marriage. And I really like her for that.Well it\u2019s really interesting to read everyone\u2019s take on Raphael. Many may not like him but I really like him as a character. Though I don\u2019t really like the way he acts but I can see why he does what he does. Till now we got much of the events from Annette\u2019s perspective and I\u2019m not gonna spoil much but in the next chapters we\u2019ll get to see how Raphael thinks and what all he has been through. It would explain why he doesn\u2019t trust anyone and why he has so many insecurities. But still yeah it doesn\u2019t justify his shitty behavior towards Annette.Wow I wrote quite too much, so I\u2019m gonna stop here. Do tell me what you think of them. Or you can ask questions, if you have any regarding the story. I\u2019ll be happy to answer them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m just trying to get along with my wife. There is no need to mention useless things like love or affection. I don\u2019t need it.\u201d\u201cWell, if you say so.\u201dHarold laughed with a meaningful face. Apparently, it seemed that he was still in denial, but it was only his own loss. Because of this, he knew he would have to suffer later. It is always better to admit it early and find a way to win the other person\u2019s heart.But Harold was going to ignore it this time. Raphael needed this opportunity to come out a bit. Because he had been stuck in his shell for so long, his emotional growth had completely stopped. Perhaps the hatred towards his mother, and the inferiority complex towards his origin were holding him back.Information about Raphael\u2019s biological mother was kept strictly confidential by King Selgratis. So no one knew who Raphael\u2019s \u201cmother\u201d was or how she died. Count Harold Evans was one of the few people who knew all the details.\u2018You poor soul.\u2019Harold had now retired due to his old age, but until a few years ago, he had been a loyal henchman of King Selgratis. Therefore, he had watched the king\u2019s illegitimate son, Raphael, since he was young. Had Harold not discovered Raphael\u2019s extraordinary swordsmanship talent and told the king about it, Raphael would have still wandered around the shady back alleys as a commoner. Or, he might have been already dead.\u201cAnyway, I\u2026 I don\u2019t want to tell Annette anything. Not only to her, but also to anyone. I\u2019d rather bite my tongue and eat it than talk about my past.\u201dRaphael murmured as he lowered his head and then grabbed it with both hands anxiously. His life before he had become the Marquis of Carnesis was like hell. Raphael was not confident to talk about his dirtiest and filthiest secrets with Annette. Annette Bavaria was the noblest and most perfect woman in the kingdom of Deltium. How can I tear my heart apart and reveal my rotten past to someone like her, who is so spotless and dazzling?\u2018Raphael is a good person. He should be respected.\u2019Raphael felt ashamed when he remembered Annette\u2019s face, innocently defending him without knowing anything. When Harold saw Raphael\u2019s distressed expression, he said,\u201cOne has to prepare his heart to reveal his toughest secret. If you\u2019re not ready, you don\u2019t have to force yourself to confess. If you wait calmly, time will help you mature, just like a fermented bread. Well, who knows, maybe by then your stubborn mouth may open easily.\u201d\u201cBut before that, Annette will leave me.\u201dRaphael had a strong feeling. He had a wild intuition inside him that lived and breathed just like an animal. Everytime he saw Annette staring off into the distance with a lonely expression, that intuition whispered to him ominously. \u2018She\u2019s thinking of running away.\u2019 When Harold listened to Raphael\u2019s words, he pondered for a while and then put forward a suggestion.\u201cThen be nicer to your wife. Think you\u2019re the master of secrets, and completely spoil your wife. Then, I don\u2019t know. Maybe she might stick with you patiently, even if you fall from her graces.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026 What kind of crap are you spewing out, old man?\u201dRaphael raised his head, furrowing his handsome eyebrows. But Harold\u2019s eyes looking at him were not joking. Although the old gentleman\u2019s eyebrows had become gray, the shining eyes underneath them still had a lively look.\u201cWomen are wise. Your wife must have already noticed that you\u2019re hiding something from her. So be good to your wife. To the point even if she gets to know about it, she won\u2019t leave you and would dismiss it saying \u2018since you\u2019re this good, can\u2019t I turn a blind eye to a little secret?\u2019 Do you understand me?\u201dOnly then did Raphael, who understood Harold\u2019s words, become silent. It sounded like a very wise advice, but how should one be good to a woman? Raphael had never been \u201cgood\u201d to any woman. To be honest, Annette was the first person with whom he wanted to try to have something similar to a relationship. Harold, who saw through Raphael\u2019s heart, laughed and teased him.\u201cOh, can\u2019t you do that because of your pride? Or is it because you\u2019re flustered? Well, you\u2019ve been very shy since you were a child. When you bought a pocket watch for my birthday present, you were so embarrassed that you couldn\u2019t even give it to me yourself and ordered a servant to send it to the branch.\u2026.\u201d\u201cUgh so noisy!! Damn it, it was foolish of me to come here.\u201dWhen the forgotten dark history was forcibly brought out, Raphael jumped up from his seat and tried to gallop out of the room. At that moment, Harold wiped the smile from his face and gave a last advise.\u201cYou know I love you so much. Even your odd personality and arrogance look cute in my eyes. But a real man must know when to bend his ego. Just pretend to be pitiful and turn her heart around! Do not choose any stupid means or methods. Otherwise, you will soon end up like me.\u201dHarold poured all his youth and passion into his work. And in return, he got everything. Except for love.The woman, whom Harold had loved with all his heart, left him and married another man. All this was because Harold firmly believed that she would not leave him as long as he was successful. But all she ever wanted from him was some caring words and a little attention. Harold was so stupid that he didn\u2019t notice this and so lost her forever.Raphael, who knew Harold\u2019s past, looked at him with a grim look. For Raphael, Harold was no less than a benefactor. But Harold felt much closer to him as a father figure than his own biological father, King Selgratis. So he could not take his advice lightly. Just then, Raphael\u2019s gaze suddenly moved from Harold\u2019s hand to the shiny ring on his finger.\u201cOh, old man. What the hell is that ring? Is this ring popular in Deltium these days?\u201dThe ring in Harold\u2019s hand was similar to the one in his memory. The large amethyst ring was uniquely engraved with an alphabet. Just like the one he found in Annette\u2019s drawer when he was nursing her before.\u201cOh, this? You don\u2019t know. This is a ring of a guild called \u2018Secret\u2019. All of their most distinguished customers have one such ring.\u201d\u201cSecret? What kind of guild is that?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 Well, first of all, should I call it an errand guild? It started with small information transactions and now does almost any illegal thing a customer wants. It\u2019s a place that has been emerging rapidly in the last 5 years, but the guild master is quite something big. Rumor has it that he is one of the few \u2018real\u2019 wizards left.\u201dEven after retirement, Harold was still Harold. It wasn\u2019t unusual for Harold, who had once worked as a secret agent, to know all the information guilds of the underworld. But it was certainly strange for Annette to know such a place. She was an extremely elegant and ordinary noblewoman who loved to read and do embroidery.\u201cGive me more details, old man. What specific things do you do in that guild?\u201dAs his face distorted with anxiety, Raphael turned and sat down in front of Harold.* * *The weather was nice. The blue sky was clear, the sun was hot, but the wind blowing was cool. So Annette sat in the garden and read a book peacefully. Although the content was information on the temple that Celestine mainly attends, it was undeniable that this time was peaceful.\u2018Except for one.\u2019Annette, who took her eyes off the book for a moment, sighed a little when she saw Raphael from a distance. Apparently he had recently changed his tendency to show his back these days and was now sticking to show his front side. And on top of that he kept a very disturbing distance from her. They could see each other well just with a turn of their eyes, but it was such an ambiguous distance which forced one to get up and approach the other person to talk.Annette was uncomfortable with Raphael\u2019s sharp eyes, staring at her like a hawk. So she closed the book and got up without saying anything. She was going back to her room to avoid him. But as soon as Annette turned around, Raphael came right next to her and grabbed her wrist.\u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d\u201c\u2026Talk? About what?\u201dAnnette looked up at Raphael without any anticipation. Whenever she tried to talk, he got annoyed and avoided it, so now, what does he want to talk about? When Annette stared at him without accepting or refusing his request, a little nervousness appeared on Raphael\u2019s face.\u201cJust for a minute.\u201dIf it had been earlier, he would have taken Annette by the arm and dragged her along as he pleased. But he couldn\u2019t do that to Annette anymore. Raphael shut his mouth tight. The woman, who was standing in front of him, looking at him indifferently, was driving him crazy. Naturally, Harold\u2019s advice, whom he had met a few days ago, came to his mind.\u2018Be good to your wife. Get rid of things like pride.\u2019But, what the hell should I do to be good? Raphael was just about to curse. If you were going to give me such advice, you should have told me about it in detail. Unnecessarily scaring people. Raphael grumbled inwardly and looked around desperately.Fortunately, he noticed some dahlias blooming in groups. As soon as he saw it, he remembered hearing that women liked flowers. Without thinking any further, he reached out and plucked the biggest dahlia. And then carefully placed it in Annette\u2019s other hand.\u201cIt would really only take a minute, Annette. Let\u2019s talk.\u201d\u201cIs this for me?\u201dInstead of answering, Annette looked at dahlia given by Raphael with shock. It was the first time she had received anything from him. She never thought she would one day get a flower from him. Though it was not bought or wrapped beautifully in a bouquet, it still felt quite novel.\u201cWait a minute.\u201dSeeing that Annette was interested in the flower, Raphael let go of her wrist and began to sweep the dahlias away. Under his ruthless grasp, the dahlias broke in an instant. If the gardener had seen this domineering way of handling flowers, he sure would have screamed and shed tears. However, the gardener\u2019s shock was of no concern to Raphael. In a blink of an eye, Raphael made a bouquet large enough to cover Annette\u2019s torso and then gave the whole bunch to her.\u201cIf you think it\u2019s not enough, I can pluck some more. So talk to me, Annette.\u201d\u2018\u2026. You\u2018re going to pluck more?\u2019 As Annette received the bunch of flowers, her pupils trembled. It was good to receive a flower as a gift from the husband, but this was a little too much. Annette decided to follow him quietly before he plucked out all the flowers in the garden.To tell the truth, she was still reluctant to talk to Raphael. She had no expectation that he would tell her the truth. However, since Raphael had showed this much sincerity, she had to give him a chance. Now even his tone sounded like a pleading. Annette\u2019s heart softened on seeing this. She looked back at Raphael.\u201cThen let\u2019s go that way. Shall we?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/How to Tame My Beastly HusbandChapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt felt really strange to follow a woman who was much smaller than himself. Raphael looked at the dazzling sunlight as the sun sank over the top of her round head. \u2018It would be nice if I could stretch my arms behind that back and hug that slender body. And then rub my lips against those golden hair which held the warmth of the sun.\u2019 However, Annette suddenly stopped walking and turned around, making Raphael stunned.\u201cWhat do you have to say?\u201dRaphael bit his lips. He was prepared to some extent to reveal his secrets, but when he faced Annette, his mouth refused to open. After considering it very much, he decided to speak out what he wanted to say first.\u201cAnnette, I\u2026I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know Ben was working as your coachman and that he was the one who framed you.\u201dRaphael was worried that Annette would suspect he was an accomplice of Ben. After all, it was true that he was the only one who benefitted from this false charge.There was no princess in the Deltium royal family, so Annette Bavaria became the most noble woman in the kingdom of Deltium. Taking her as his wife, the flaw in Raphael\u2019s lineage was compensated. So, he was worried that Annette might suspect that this was a fraudulent marriage. Annette, who listened quietly to Raphael, replied,\u201cI thought so, too. That you won\u2019t have anything to do with the case. The fact that Ivan, no\u2026 Ben shares his blood with you was quite shocking. But now I don\u2019t doubt you or anything.\u201d\u201cDo you trust me?The intensity of Raphael\u2019s hard-spoken words softened with a little hope. Unfortunately, Annette didn\u2019t say this because she trusted him, as Raphael thought. Annette, with her golden eyelashes lowered, calmly expressed her thoughts.\u201cIt would be too much to call you an accomplice\u2026.. since you were reluctant to marry me. You hated me so much, so you couldn\u2019t have been involved in it to marry me. Unless you have some strange likeness for enjoying sufferings.\u201dRaphael\u2019s wicked mouth was effectively sealed with this. There were too many misdeeds for which he had to be accountable now. He had nothing more to say because it was true that he didn\u2019t want to marry Annette. If his biological father, King Selgratis, hadn\u2019t forced him by saying, \u201cThis is all for you,\u201d he would never have married Annette on his own will.While Raphael was sweating and couldn\u2019t say a word, Annette raised her head and looked at him. Her face looked a little tired. The gentle smile and warm consideration had all disappeared.\u201cIs that all you have to say? Then I\u2019ll get going.\u201dAnnette turned her back slowly. Her thin blonde hair fluttered in the air, and her pink eyes, which looked lonely under her eyelashes, turned away from him. Raphael couldn\u2019t just let Annette go away like this.\u201cWait a minute.\u201dFortunately, Annette, as usual, did not ignore him. Annette turned her back and looked at him gently as if there was still nothing left to say. The moment his eyes met her pretty ones, Raphael\u2019s mouth suddenly moved on its own and so a request for a date popped out of his mouth.\u201cWell, hmm\u2026 If it\u2019s okay with you, would you go to the party next week? Umm, that couple party at the Count Lucini\u2019s.\u201dAnnette said nothing, but tilted her head slightly to the side. Maybe she was thinking \u2018Why me?\u2019 As soon as he met Annette\u2019s reluctant eyes, Raphael instinctively felt that he would be rejected. His heart sank feeling a sense of crisis. At that time, Harold\u2019s words suddenly came to his mind.\u2018Don\u2019t hold to your pride and pretend to be pitiful!\u2019Yeah, anyway the dice had already been thrown. He had to get an answer from her and for that he would go by any means possible. Raphael unknowingly lowered his eyes and muttered, avoiding Annette\u2019s gaze.\u201cYou must attend the party Annette. My benefactor will be there. He couldn\u2019t attend our wedding for some reason, so he asked me to introduce him to you. He\u2019s a very important person to me\u2026..\u201dIt was a blatant lie. Raphael actually did not know whether Harold was going to attend the party or not. To be honest, there was a high probability that he wouldn\u2019t. This was because Harold was unmarried and it was a party which you had to attend as a couple. However, since Harold himself had advised him to act pitiful, he should not complain about it. Raphael decided to think as he liked.\u201cYour benefactor?\u201dFortunately, Annette was interested in this clumsy excuse. This was because it was the first time that Raphael had revealed something about his past to Annette. Although Raphael himself didn\u2019t realise this, Annette\u2019s interest encouraged him to speak more. Naturally, Raphael\u2019s chatter became a little more convincing.\u201cYeah. As you know I\u2026Because my birth\u2026 is a bit complicated, I can call only a few people as family. But his position in my life is just like His Majesty,\u2026he\u2019s kind of like a father figure to me. I wouldn\u2019t be here by now if it wasn\u2019t for him. So I really want to introduce you both. He\u2019s one of the few people who really cares about me.\u201dOriginally, the most persuasive lie was a lie with 50 percent truth added in it. As he talked about his actual situation, a slight lonesome look appeared on Raphael\u2019s face. Annette hesitated when she saw it. Raphael instinctively realised that this was the opportunity and quickly grabbed her hand.\u201cPlease, Annette, come with me. You\u2019re my wife, aren\u2019t you?\u201dRaphael\u2019s words informing her about her wife\u2019s duties were effective. Annette, who had grown up surrounded by duties and responsibilities from an early age, became weak at those words. But the reason why she hesitated was not just because she had to fulfill her duties as a wife.Annette was really surprised at seeing Raphael look at her with desperate eyes. She couldn\u2019t believe that words like \u2018please\u2019 could come out of those wicked lips that only knew how to spit out mean words. Annette realised that this benefactor was indeed really important to Raphael. So she nodded eventually.\u2018Well, since I would be leaving Raphael soon, I\u2019ll do him a favor for the last time.\u2019In fact, there was only one thing that Raphael did wrong in the current tragedy that Annette was facing. And that was his refusal to communicate with her regarding his past. However, she did not also want to force him to do so. How could he do something that he detested and tell his secrets to someone who he didn\u2019t believe?The rest of the problems were too vague to blame Raphael. However, all these problems would only be solved if Annette left Raphael and Deltium. To do that, she had to meet Celestine Keers as soon as possible.\u2018I don\u2019t know when all this will be over, but I think I can do you a favor before that.\u2019\u201cThank you, Annette!\u201dWith a wide smile, Raphael held her up and turned around. He easily lifted her up as if she was a paper doll. Surprised by this, Annette\u2019s eyes widened and she clutched his shoulder tightly. Finally, after hugging Annette tightly, Raphael put her down on the floor and said,\u201cThank you very much. For coming with me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dAnnette, who didn\u2019t know Raphael would like it this much, answered vaguely. At this point, she wondered who this benefactor was for whom Raphael would behave like this. It seemed she would have to pay attention to her dress at the ball.* * *\u201cThat\u2019s what happened, so please cooperate.\u201d\u201cHuh, look at this shameless bastard!\u201dHarold, who was dragged out to the party on Raphael\u2019s sudden notice, was really irked by his request. Harold didn\u2019t really want to attend the party in the first place. Harold, who attended a couple party alone, was sad and upset.\u2018You\u2019re such an ungrateful bastard.\u2019If he had known this would happen, he wouldn\u2019t have given him any advice. In the meantime, Raphael\u2019s face as he was smiling all alone waiting for his wife, made him even more angrier.\u201cJust wait and see how I deal with you later! When your wife comes, I\u2019ll tell her all your dark history.\u201d\u201cTry it if you can.\u201dRaphael stood in front of Harold with his arms crossed like a huge barrier. The comparison felt more so because of his tall and muscular build. Seeing that Harold was about to say nonsense, it really took all his will to not drag him out of there. Feeling the transient flow of time*, Harold trembled softly and gently stepped on Raphael\u2019s shiny shoes.*[I don\u2019t whether this makes sense to you, so I\u2019ll make it a bit clear. It\u2019s that feeling when you reminisce about old memories and suddenly feel as if time had quickly passed.]\u201cWhat the hell are you doing old man? It\u2019s a new pair of shoes!!\u201dRaphael frowned. He quickly took out his handkerchief and wiped his shoe clean. His intention to quickly finish grooming himself before Annette\u2019s arrival was really apparent. Harold, who had been watching this with an amused look, suddenly asked as he had remembered something.\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you come with your wife?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. She told me to go ahead because she had some work to do. She would follow soon.\u201dRaphael, who was still checking his shoe, responded dully. Harold realised something from the words and began to laugh. When Raphael heard his laughter, he raised his head wondering what was wrong with him. Harold, who had been waiting for this moment, tried to suppress his laughter.\u201cAnyway, you\u2019re really an idiot. She didn\u2019t want to go with you, that\u2019s why she told you to go ahead.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that! She said she really had some work to do.\u201d\u201cOh, believe whatever you want. She must have made up some things to do so that she wouldn\u2019t have to ride the same carriage with you.\u201d\u201cFuck! \u201cRaphael unknowingly spit out curses that he had learned during his days as a commoner. Harold had only hit his sore spot, and a billion curses came out of his mouth on its own. Meanwhile, the smile returned on Harold\u2019s face, who had finally taken his revenge for being dragged to a couple party. Such retaliation was the best way to teach an ungrateful black-haired beast.Raphael frowned at seeing the nasty smile on his face. He was about to say something to Harold, but a familiar face caught his sharp eyes. Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t Annette\u2019s pretty face.\u2018Why the hell is he here?\u2019Raphael\u2019s face was sharply distorted. The man who was greeted by everyone from afar was a very handsome man. With his tall body, white face, sculpture like delicate features, and his long silver hair, he looked like a prince who had come out of a fairy tale.\u2018Prince Ludwig\u2026\u2026!\u2019Raphael\u2019s blue eyes sank coldly when he unexpectedly ran into his half-brother.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The dress made of high quality blue fabric sprinkled with diamond powder, sparkled like a star in the night sky. Her blonde hair was braided to the side and was decorated with a blue velvet rose hair corsage to highlight her golden tresses. The overall color tone was calm, but the details made it look rather colorful, so it seemed a suitable dress to meet Raphael\u2019s benefactor.After finishing her final inspection, Annette entered the party with a smile on her face. After a formal greeting with the host of the party, Count Lucini and his wife, she looked around, but she couldn\u2019t find Raphael. Annette looked around with a puzzled look.\u2018I told you to go first.\u2019Although she had agreed to attend the party on Raphael\u2019s request, she found it burdensome to be alone with him in the carriage. Annette always became weak when it came to affection and became even more weak when it came to Raphael, with whom she had been married for five years in her previous life. If he hadn\u2019t taken good care of her when she was sick in her previous life, she would have left him long ago. Annette was afraid that if she became close to Raphael again, she would fall for him.So that\u2019s why Annette encouraged him to attend separately. Fortunately, Raphael had no experience attending a couple\u2019s party, so he readily accepted her request. He wasn\u2019t the type to stray away without informing, so he must have arrived at the ball first. But she couldn\u2019t see Raphael at all. A man with such a prominent appearance like him should be easy to find.\u201cAnnette Bavaria?\u201dJust then, someone called out Annette\u2019s name. Annette blinked and looked at the strange gentleman. The man wearing a dark blue suit with a mahogany cane in one hand looked quite old. Nevertheless, his well-kept short beard and solid body frame made him look very sophisticated.\u201cOh, I see you don\u2019t know who I am. I usually stay abroad a lot. I am Count Harold Evans. It\u2019s my pleasure to meet such a great lady like you.\u201dThe old gentleman, who introduced himself, was very polite despite his age. Annette became quite fond of Harold because of that. She happily smiled and gently holded Harold\u2019s hands.\u201cOh, so you\u2019re Count Evans. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. I\u2019m Annette Bavaria Carnesis.\u201dHarold Evans was once considered as the most mysterious man among Annette\u2019s previous generation. No one knew exactly about his life in detail or what business he did abroad. But all the rumors about Harold were amazing. It seemed like hearing about beans sprouting in drought. He had tracked down traitors, caught many people who had escaped to other countries after committing felony and so on.Although Harold was now retired and confined to his estate, the mystery around him did not fade. So Annette looked up at the old legend with twinkling eyes. Seeing this, a chuckle almost escaped out of Harold\u2019s mouth.\u201cYou are more lovely than what I thought. If I was now my twenty years old younger self, I would have given Raphael a good competition. Alas! It\u2019s quite unfortunate.\u201d\u201cDo you know my husband?\u201d\u201cHmm I know. I\u2019ll let you in on a secret.\u201dLooking around, Harold lowered his voice and gestured to Annette. Annette was captivated by his mysterious behavior and unknowingly leaned closer to listen to him. Then Harold, with a serious look on his face, whispered in her ear.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret I\u2019ve never told anyone. I\u2019m the person who had changed the blankets that he peed on.\u201d\u201cWhat? Raphael peed on the blanket. I\u2019m sorry?\u201d\u201cHe was pretty cute back then. He couldn\u2019t even say that he peed, but he cried and held on to the bottom of his pants. In those times, I really tried my best to hold back the corners of my mouth from rising. Haah! I didn\u2019t expect that cute little thing would change to such a bad and boring guy. Who would have known?\u201dHarold pretended to be disappointed. At first, Annette was alarmed at the shocking revelation of Raphael\u2019s childhood. But soon a smile came on her face. In Annette\u2019s memory, Raphael had always been a big, violent, and mean man. She couldn\u2019t believe Raphael had peed on his blankets when he was young.Annette, who was listening to Harold, smiled and realized something. Looking around, she lowered her voice and asked Harold.\u201cSir Evans, you must be Raphael\u2019s benefactor, right?\u201dInstead of answering, Harold smiled and placed a finger on his lips. Annette quickly became more comfortable with him. She somehow ended up unintentionally meeting Raphael\u2019s benefactor first, but it was a party that she had attended to meet Harold anyway. Annette felt like she had achieved today\u2019s task early, so she became more mentally relaxed. Harold, who was analyzing Annette\u2019s expressions, suddenly changed the subject.\u201cIsn\u2019t he a very bad person?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not honest, he\u2019s very proud and he\u2019s too arrogant. He\u2019s almost like a hedgehog. He will hurt others first so that they won\u2019t hurt him. What an ugly, bad guy.\u201dAnnette was at a loss for what to say, so she just smiled. Raphael\u2019s own benefactor suddenly began to badmouth him. But she couldn\u2019t refute anything because it was all true. Harold, who glanced at Annette\u2019s quivering pupils, shrugged and said.\u201cIf he makes you upset, just divorce him. You\u2019re still young and pretty. You don\u2019t have to live with such a nasty guy. If I were in your position, I\u2019d throw him away without looking back. Once he\u2019s abandoned, he\u2019ll come to his senses.\u201dAnnette didn\u2019t know that it was Harold\u2019s specialty to deliberately exaggerate his words and test people\u2019s reactions. Harold watched Annette\u2019s facial expression change in seconds while cursing Raphael. He saw her delicate eyebrows furrow a little. Soon, Annette spoke in defense of Raphael.\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad person. He\u2019s just\u2026. just a little stubborn.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know why she felt so bad when she heard other people badmouthing Raphael. Annette recalled Raphael\u2019s sincere face as he told her, \u2018He\u2019s my benefactor that I want to introduce to you.\u2019 Harold was so important to Raphael that he had even bent his pride and said \u2018please\u2019 to her. However, when she met Harold, he bad-mouthed Raphael a lot. So Annette was very upset.But fighting with Harold here wasn\u2019t a good choice either. After all, Raphael considered him as his benefactor, so he would be hurt if she fought with him in front of Raphael. Annette decided to rather end this uncomfortable conversation quickly and move away from Harold. She smiled gracefully and asked in a soft but determined tone.\u201cDo you happen to know where my husband is? I want to say hello to him first.\u201dHarold did not answer immediately and simply smiled. Annette knew how to avoid unnecessary conflicts without being influenced by her own emotions or thoughts. It was a wise attitude which was quite not suitable for her age. At least that was what it seemed to Harold. Harold slowly stroked his sharp chin and pointed somewhere. It was a balcony covered with thick curtains.\u201cThank you.\u201dAnnette responded politely and turned around to go there. Just as she was about to move, Harold\u2019s advice came from behind.\u201cIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t go in there now.\u201d\u2018What is he talking about now?\u2019 Annette looked back at him, but Harold just smiled vaguely. It didn\u2019t seem that asking him would get her answers. Annette headed toward the balcony where a bomb was lurking.Usually, at parties like these, people would come to the balcony, so the hosts would put out curtains to prevent others from disturbing them and give them some privacy. And sometimes in such places there usually would be secret meetings between a couple or secret lovers. Or sometimes even passionate encounters between men and women.Of course, it was unlikely that Raphael would do something like that, but it was also something that she couldn\u2019t say for sure. He was after all a very handsome and attractive man. A man, who shone on his own with just his face and tall and muscular body, sure would attract many women\u2019s attention. Annette became more determined to go to the balcony where Harold had pointed. Hearing the sound of conversation leaking through the curtain, it was clear that Raphael was in there.However, he was having a hot\u2019 time\u2019 in a way that was quite different from Annette\u2019s expectations.\u201c\u2026\u2026in the past, she\u2019s my wife now. So please get your hands off my wife. Every time Your Highness wanders around her like a rutting dog, my loyalty towards you keeps turning upside down.\u201dRaphael\u2019s voice coming from the inside was as cold and hard as steel. Annette\u2019s mouth opened on its own when she heard the vulgar remarks. Someone who Raphael would call \u2018Your Highness\u2019 and tell that person to get his hands away from his wife\u2026.. There was only one person in the whole Deltium who could meet these two conditions.\u2018Is he with His Highness, Prince Ludwig ?\u2019Annette\u2019s face turned pale from shock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, it was a relationship that was bound to be complicated.In terms of age, Raphael was a couple of years older than Ludwig, but he was just an illegitimate child. And Ludwig was the heir of the noble royal family. Although they had the same father, their positions were very different, just like the difference between the sky and earth. In short, if Ludwig was the light, then Raphael was the shadow cast behind it.Raphael didn\u2019t want to marry Annette as Ludwig\u2019s substitute. And on top of that she was a woman from the Bavarian family, who were big pedigree supremacists. Raphael and Bavaria were literally poles apart. So he expected the marriage to be nothing more than a wreck.\u2018But now\u2026..\u2019He hated to admit it but Annette had become someone special to him. The tears falling from her eyes felt like hot candle wax falling over his heart. Because of his misunderstandings, he wrongfully berated her, but now he could see that it was over there that he started to lose his treasure. This happened all because Ludwig kept on hanging around and snooping around other people\u2019s wife. Raphael\u2019s eyes became cold when he saw Ludwig.\u201cAnnette is my wife now. And she feels uncomfortable running into you,Your Highness. I don\u2019t understand why people who already have a fianc\u00e9e would keep doing this. Does Your Majesty know about this?\u201dLudwig laughed ridiculously at the mention of his father. As Ludwig leaned against the wall, a sharp answer naturally came out of his mouth.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had to get permission from my father at this age. I was just going to attend the party with my fianc\u00e9e, but she canceled at the last moment, so I had to come alone.\u201d\u201cHa! Even a child won\u2019t believe in such excuses. Then since my wife doesn\u2019t have anything to do, I\u2019ll take her and leave.\u201dRaphael smiled and tried to turn his back. Ludwig, who had not yet met Annette, became nervous. On the surface, he pretended to be calm, but it was true that he had come here to meet Annette. Raphael was again going to take her away from him. Ludwig\u2019s demeanor broke down when he heard Raphael\u2019s words as if Annette only belonged to him.\u201cWhy, are you now afraid that you\u2019ll lose your wife if she sees me? You were the one who whined to father that you didn\u2019t want to get married to her. You said you didn\u2019t like a woman from the Bavarian family who were all like snakes. Then why? Now, is it that you started liking snakes? It\u2019s ridiculous that you\u2019re saying this now.\u201dRaphael\u2019s face, as he looked back, became blue with anger. In the first place, he was the type who used his fist to talk. But this time, the opponent wasn\u2019t good. If he had achieved the ability of Sword Master, he could have landed him a blow or two, but he was not in a position to do so yet. King Selgratis sure would not forgive Raphael for assaulting the Crown Prince. So Raphael folded his arms and tightly clenched his fist to hold himself back.\u201cIf she really was so precious to you, then why didn\u2019t you do anything earlier? Unlike me, you knew from the beginning that Annette was falsely accused. Annette must have felt heartbroken because you knew everything and still did nothing. Now, she has no regrets or feelings for you, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cAnd you? Do you think Annette loves you? No way! She\u2019s a noble and delicate woman. So she would never like a rude bastard like you.\u201dLudwig, who was stabbed in his sore spot, gritted his teeth and mocked Raphael. When Ludwig, the royal heir, looked down at him contemptuously, Raphael clenched his jaw. Just because he was born well and had everything, Ludwig\u2019s selfishness to take Annette away was disgusting. So Raphael brazenly gave a blow to Ludwig by completely abandoning his conscience.\u201cNo. Annette likes me. And very much at that. Your Highness must have felt it too, haven\u2019t you? If she didn\u2019t like me, she would have taken your hand when Your Highness reached out to her long ago. Well, if she really has eyes to see, she would prefer a real man like me rather than a clumsy weakling.\u201dAs Raphael challenged and laughed at Ludwig, the corners of his mouth rose in a mocking smile. At that moment, it was Ludwig who lost his composure first. Because of Raphael\u2019s jab at his embarrassing weakness and the trauma from Annette\u2019s rejection, Ludwig lost his temper. He gritted his teeth and grabbed Raphael by the collar.\u201cShut up! What do you think you know? You don\u2019t know anything!! About her, about our relationship!\u201dRaphael looked at Ludwig\u2019s face with grim eyes. In his deep blue eyes, the glimpse of the features that were stained with anger had a clear resemblance to him. Maybe that\u2019s why he felt even more dirtier.\u201cOh, no. Even though I don\u2019t know anything, I know this one thing very well.\u201dRaphael slowly raised his hand and crushed Ludwig\u2019s hand, which held his collar. The incredible grip distorted Ludwig\u2019s face with pain. Before Raphael, who had been wielding the sword all his life, someone like Ludwig, who had only played the lute and held the pen, was of no match. Feeling the crushing pain, Ludwig eventually had to let go of his grip on Raphael\u2019s collar.At that moment, Raphael grasped Ludwig\u2019s shoulder and pushed him against the wall. His elbows and forearms pressed hard near Ludwig\u2019s neck. Ludwig felt suffocated because he was caught between the wall and Raphael\u2019s body. He tried his best to get out of the humiliating position, but Raphael didn\u2019t even budge. Raphael, who bowed his head to bring his face close to Ludwig, growled.\u201cIt\u2019s stupid to attack someone who\u2019s stronger than you. Especially when you\u2019re alone.\u201cUgh\u2026humph\u201d!!\u201dLudwig glared at Raphael with bloodshot eyes and then again grabbed his collar. As he pulled desperately, Raphael\u2019s collar tore making a crisp sound. Just then, Annette, who had come through the curtain gap, found this scene.\u201cRaphael\u2026.Oh my God!\u201dAnnette\u2019s pupils quivered. At first glance, Raphael and Ludwig did not seem as if they were fighting, but they rather seemed as if they were\u2026 sharing the hot passion of adults. Raphael had Ludwig trapped in his arms and pressed against the wall while Ludwig stretched out his hand and tore off his clothes. They were looking at each other with their faces up very close.\u2018I\u2026 Did I disturb them?\u2019Annette\u2019s pupils trembled as if an earthquake had broken out in them. If she hadn\u2019t heard their quarrel coming over from behind the curtains, she really wouldn\u2019t have experienced this scene. Fortunately, Raphael, who first noticed Annette\u2019s presence, removed his hands and released Ludwig.\u201cAnnette.\u201dBeing conscious of Ludwig\u2019s presence, Raphael called her more affectionately than usual. Ludwig, who was clutching his collar and glaring at him, immediately looked this way. As soon as he saw Annette, Ludwig\u2019s expression suddenly changed 180 degrees. Ludwig, who just had been wielding his claws and revealing his teeth, suddenly called Annette with a sad face.\u201cAnnette\u2026.\u201dLudwig, who looked as if he was crying, staggered as he approached Annette and then suddenly fell down. Annette was surprised to see this and quickly supported Ludwig.\u201cOh my! Your Highness, are you all right?\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019m going to have another seizure\u2026\u2026it\u2019s painful.\u201dLudwig leaned his head against Annette\u2019s arm and breathed roughly. Raphael was bewildered seeing Ludwig suddenly pretend to be pitiful as if he didn\u2019t care about his image. Just now, he was so lively that he tore off his clothes.\u2018What the hell is this nonsense?\u2019Raphael\u2019s eyebrows distorted unpleasantly. It was obvious that Ludwig was just acting. However, Annette took care of him with a worried look, as if she had fallen for his trick.\u201cBreathe slowly, Your Highness. The faster you breathe because of anxiety, the worse your condition will be. Don\u2019t worry and bend your head more.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in pain, Annette\u2026 huh..keuk\u2026\u201dLudwig moistened his eyes and rubbed his cheeks against Annette\u2019s arms. He threw away all his pride and guilt. Raphael, who saw this happen right in front of his eyes, literally felt ridiculous. In the eyes of Raphael, who thought men should be manly, Ludwig\u2019s current appearance was a culture shock to him.He really wanted to kick Ludwig and yell at him to stop his bloody acting right away. But considering Ludwig\u2019s status, he could not do such a thing in front of Annette. He wondered how he looked in Annette\u2019s eyes.\u2018You must think I\u2019m a barbarian with no blood or tears.\u2019Raphael gritted his teeth and endured his stomach turning upside down. But Annette was also wise. Annette, who used her shawl to support Ludwig\u2019s head, stood up. Then she said to Raphael with a worried look.\u201cRaphael, I\u2019ll go and bring someone. Please watch Your Highness until then.\u201dIn fact, thinking of Ludwig, it would have been better for her to stay and take care of him, and for Raphael to go and call the people. But Annette didn\u2019t want to wait alone with Ludwig on the balcony, which was usually used for \u2018secret meetings\u2019. It would be a perfect topic for people to gossip about. So, it was a much wiser choice to leave Raphael and Ludwig alone.\u201cOf course. Trust me, Annette. I\u2019ll take good care of him.\u201dThere was a very bright smile on his lips. When Annette saw his smile, she felt uncomfortable because it felt like leaving a mouse with a cat alone. But there was no time to think about useless things. If Ludwig really had a seizure, she had to hurry to save him. Annette quickly walked out of the curtains and called the people.\u201cYour Highness, the Crown Prince has fallen! Somebody please come and help!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Generally at times like this, it was Annette who filled the silence with her soft voice. Raphael looked sideways and found her sitting beside him with her eyelashes lowered, completely lost in thought. Eventually, Raphael couldn\u2019t take it anymore and opened his mouth first by coughing.\u201cYour Royal Highness seemed to be fine. He looked so perfectly fine that I wondered whether he faked his illness.\u201dRaphael sneakily brought up Ludwig\u2019s fake illness. Ludwig, who had been lying on the floor acting as if he was dying, jumped up as soon as Annette left. Raphael was dumbfounded when he saw it. Thanks to that, the ruckus around the prince\u2019s seizure ended safely, but Ludwig was indeed shameless to the end. He was really a little fox, if not so, then how could a person change their words so quickly.Raphael learned a lesson from today\u2019s event. He finally understood that Harold\u2019s words, \u2018Pretend to be pitiful\u2019 somewhat referred to Ludwig\u2019s behavior. His shamelessness was really at an incomparable level. He didn\u2019t even feel a little bit embarrassed before Annette. This gave Raphael a great enlightenment.\u201cAnyway don\u2019t worry about the prince. As far as I\u2019ve observed, he\u2019ll eat and live well until his senility.\u201dIn Raphael\u2019s eyes, he was not a man but a little fox monster*. He said brusquely, trying not to tremble. Annette, who was pulled out of her thoughts, blinked hearing Raphael\u2019s strong intonation. Ludwig had long disappeared from Annette\u2019s head and now another man was plaguing her mind.*[The words fox and monster are actually metaphors for a scary cunning person. Ludwig left quite an impact on Raphael, lol.]\u201cOh, Raphael, I met your benefactor. He\u2019s Count Harold Evans, right?\u201d\u201cDid you meet that old man? When?\u201dRaphael furrowed his eyebrows. Harold\u2019s words came to his mind, that he would expose his shameful history to his wife as a retaliation for forcing him to attend the party. Sure enough, Annette looked at him and smiled softly.\u201cAs soon as I arrived at the party, I was lucky to meet him right away. He seems to know you very well.\u201d\u201cDid he say anything stupid to you? Like what I was like when I was a kid?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know.\u201dAnnette smiled ambiguously and kept her words short. She couldn\u2019t tell Raphael all the bad things that Harold had told her about him. The benefactor whom he valued him so much badmouthed him behind his back. So in Annette\u2019s eyes, Raphael, who knew nothing about this, was really pitiful.\u201cDon\u2019t believe anything what the old man said. He exaggerates everything.\u201dRaphael leaned back and spat out with an indifferent face. Listening to his words, Annette nodded her head silently. Because of this, silence fell in the carriage again. Raphael, who felt stuffy inside, eventually couldn\u2019t overcome his temper. He grabbed Annette and placed her on his lap.\u201cWhat the hell are you thinking, Annette?\u201dRaphael growled, as he grabbed Annette\u2019s head and turned her to face him. Alarmed by this sudden action, Annette looked down at him and responded softly.\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about anything.\u201d\u201cLies! Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re concerned about the crown prince. He\u2019s a swindler.\u201dRaphael\u2019s blue eyes flared up when he remembered Ludwig\u2019s tricks earlier. Seeing that he was not likely to calm down easily, Annette sighed and leaned against his chest. This made Raphael immediately stop venting his anger. Annette said quietly in the meantime.\u201cLudwig just needs some time. Time to admit that I\u2019m not his anymore. I\u2019m sorry for what happened at the party. Because of me, you got involved with him.\u201dAfter saying these words, Annette wriggled her body a little and took a comfortable position. As she leaned her head against the gap between Raphael\u2019s firm shoulders and neck, she felt a strange sense of stability. \u2018He\u2019s a man whom I\u2019ll leave one day, then why do I always feel like this when I\u2019m with him?\u2019 Annette turned her dull eyes to the side so that Raphael wouldn\u2019t see it.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re my wife. It\u2019s my duty to protect you from such strange people. So don\u2019t say sorry for something like this.\u201dRaphael said flatly. He became anxious when he heard Annette\u2019s overly polite tone. It seemed as if she was drawing a line between them. Raphael\u2019s anxious arms hugged Annette\u2019s body tightly from behind. His sturdy arms seemed as if he\u2019ll never let her go away. This made Annette feel even more strange.\u2018Why do you act like this when you don\u2019t even like me?\u2019Annette did not want to be swayed by Raphael\u2019s whimsical gentleness. What if she gets fooled by this warmth and gives her heart away, only to end up getting coldly rejected by him with words like \u2018It\u2019s none of my business\u2019? Annette wanted to first make sure whether her predictions were correct or not. So she gently skimmed her fingers over Raphael\u2019s tense forearm and asked quietly.\u201cYour uncle\u2026 will you tell me about him?\u201dAt that moment, Raphael\u2019s body stiffened. It was a familiar pattern. Annette thought he would soon pull himself off her and coldly push her aside. But Raphael unexpectedly let out a painful groan and pressed his forehead against her shoulder. His arms, holding Annette tightly, became more tense. Just as if he was embarrassed.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that.\u201dThis was an unexpected reaction. Annette\u2019s eyes moved a little. She knew nothing about Ivan, the coachman who ruined her future. It was because he was an employee who entered the duchy with a forged identity. All the employees of the Duke of Bavaria were thoroughly investigated, so she was puzzled about how Ivan passed it.\u2018No, I should call him Ben, not Ivan anymore.\u2019Raphael sighed and rubbed his forehead against the nape of her neck. The hot breath that leaked through his lips tickled the nape of her neck, making goosebumps erupt on her skin. As if enjoying this, Raphael pressed his lips on her neck and soon opened his mouth.\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know him very well either. All I saw as a child is all I know about him. He loved gambling, and almost lived in gambling houses. And he used to steal from my child support and wasted it all on gambling. At that time, it was Harold who looked after me and was responsible for delivering my child support.\u2026 It was him who realized that I was good at swordsmanship. So he reported it to his Majesty and helped me to reach out to my father.\u201dListening to him speak about his dark past, Annette turned her head and looked at him. Raphael, feeling ashamed, reached out and covered her eyes. When Annette blinked, her long eyelashes tickled his palms. Raphael lightly bit her pale white cheeks and murmured.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me with those eyes. I keep forgetting what I was going to say.\u201dAt that, Annette slowly closed her eyes. She still wanted to hear more of Raphael\u2019s past. Raphael looked at Annette\u2019s slender chin and petal-like lips under his palm. Seeing Annette sitting so defenselessly before him, it seemed as if she was urging the sleeping beast inside him to wake up. Raphael managed to suppress this feeling and continued to speak.\u201cThat\u2019s how I was brought to the palace. Perhaps much sooner than what was expected. But since no one knew how developed my talent was, it took a long time for me to be recognized as his son. Thanks to the rise of the old rebels in Letan, I was able to show my talent and was awarded with a title much earlier than I thought. And then I also got to marry you.\u201dAfter speaking, Raphael bowed his head and kissed Annette\u2019s lips lightly. The sweet fragrance coming from her and the soft touch of her lips were incredible. It was understandable that Ludwig, who had let Annette slip through his hand, had now his eyes bloodshot* and was desperately pretending to shake** to get her back.[*It\u2019s a phrase which means to get angry or enraged to such an extent that one\u2019s eyes get bloodshot.][**This is referring to Ludwig\u2019s fake seizures]Ludwig had failed to welcome such a nice woman as his wife, making her fall into an abyss of despair by pushing her to marry him. Raphael\u2019s heart became heavy when he recalled Annette\u2019s poor situation. On one hand, the selfish beast deep in his heart opened its red mouth and laughed, saying that it was rather good that it happened. If it wasn\u2019t for the cruel trick of fate, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten the chance to be with her.Raphael struggled to hide his terrible selfishness. He smoothened his voice and explained to Annette.\u201cAnd Ben\u2026.To be honest, I don\u2019t know what happened to him. When I entered the palace, my relationship with him was already broken. We didn\u2019t have a very close relationship, so I thought Ben was hiding from loan sharks because of his gambling debts, or was already dead. But I never thought he would become your coachman and do something so vile. I really never imagined it.\u201dRaphael, who finally finished speaking, took a deep breath. He didn\u2019t disclose everything, but he had honestly spoken about Ben. Annette, whose life had been destroyed by him, at least had the right to know about him. Apparently even after hearing the whole story, she wasn\u2019t upset, but rather, she answered back with a smile.\u201cThank you. Although I know you didn\u2019t tell me everything, you really did your best.. I actually thought\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t tell me the whole story.\u201dAnnette\u2019s innocuous gratitude pierced Raphael\u2019s conscience more than ever. Raphael, with his lips clamped together, turned his head to hide his slightly reddening temples. He fiddled with Annette\u2019s long blond hair for a while and said nothing. At this moment, there was a fierce conflict raging inside Raphael.\u2018Should I apologize to Annette now?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The side profile of Annette\u2019s face, which he looked at while contemplating, was absolutely beautiful. A round forehead with a soft nose, long eyelashes, and red lips. People just couldn\u2019t help but keep on looking at her.Raphael felt a sense of crisis. If he now hesitated and didn\u2019t say what he had to say in time, or again lost his temper at her, Annette might leave him forever. And surely, she would forget about a bad guy like him and meet someone else. With whom, she would then eat and live well. After a brief period of silence, Raphael finally called out her name.\u201cAnnette, I\u2026\u2026.\u201dJust then, Annette\u2019s head drooped and leaned on his chest. Even though she was sitting on a man\u2019s lap, she was too defenseless. Frustrated by this, Raphael didn\u2019t say what he was trying to say and looked down at her. Her pale eyelids were completely closed, and slow rhythmic breaths escaped out of her lips.\u201c\u2026you, are you sleeping?\u201dOf course, no answer came back from the sleeping Annette. She seemed to have fallen asleep while Raphael was thinking about the right time to apologize to her. Well, come to think of it, Annette usually fell asleep as soon as her head touched a soft surface.\u201cHa.\u201dA peal of desolate laughter flowed out of Raphael\u2019s lips. Completely ignorant of his anguish, Annette leaned on his chest and slept like a baby. With his head tilted back, Raphael sighed and hugged Annette\u2019s body more tightly. He wanted to protect the dream of this naive sleeping woman, who left her body defenseless before a terrible beast.* * *The morning sunlight tapped on her thin eyelids, disturbing her sleep. Annette instinctively turned her head from the window and burrowed herself into a pair of warm arms. A body, large enough to cover her up, pulled her closer and hugged her tightly. She felt a little stuffy as her breasts were pressed against the hot and hard body.\u201cUh\u2026.\u201dWhen Annette groaned sleepily, the arms loosened a little bit. \u2018Yeah, this is much better.\u2019 The forearm, which was wrapped around her body, was a little heavy as if it would never let her go. But strangely she didn\u2019t dislike the feeling.A little awake, Annette rubbed her cheek against the firm, smooth skin in front of her. The pulsating heartbeats and the warmth radiating from the body felt pleasant. She unknowingly stuck a little closer to the skin and put her body in close contact with it. Then a terrible low groan rang over her head.\u201cAnnette\u2026. if you stick to me like that, damn it.\u201dThe skin against which she was rubbing her cheeks became a little hotter. It was like a hearth that radiated heat the more you touched it. The sound of the heartbeats also became loud, making her ears ring. At the loud noise, Annette eventually lifted her heavy eyelids.When she opened her eyes, the first thing she saw was a hard muscular chest. Annette\u2019s half-asleep eyes found wide shoulders, a sensual neck, and a beautiful face along with the manly muscles. It was a beautiful and cold face, just like a sculpture, and the blue eyes in it were intensely looking down at her as if they would erupt in flames.\u201c\u2026 Raphael?\u201dAnnette generally was a bit weak-minded in the morning. After waking up her muddled head, she managed to figure out who the good-looking person lying in front of her was. When his name was called, Raphael licked his lips and smiled sensually. His deep blue eyes held a dangerous glint, which unknowingly mesmerized Annette.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re up. Then I don\u2019t have to put up with it anymore.\u201dAs soon as Raphael\u2019s words fell, Annette\u2019s vision suddenly flipped over and she found herself facing the ceiling. Raphael parted her legs, grabbed her ass, and buried his face down there like a hungry beast. Before Annette could react, his lips covered her core and sucked her sensitive folds.\u201cOh, hmm!\u201dThe hot tongue licked the sensitive clitoris and poked around her core. In response, Annette\u2019s waist flinched and bounced upward. Her legs flailed about, unable to stay still due to his relentless attack. Annoyed with this, Raphael grabbed her thighs and pressed them on the sheet. He kept on licking the place as if honey was flowing between Annette\u2019s legs. His hot lips covered her clitoris and sucked vigorously, making her eyes flash and legs tremble.\u201cHuh, Raphael! That\u2019s weird..No\u2026.I don\u2019t want to.\u201dTears fell from Annette\u2019s wide-open eyes. He licked her legs so tenaciously that she was afraid that her legs would melt away. Suddenly his long thick fingers slowly poked through the narrow opening and rubbed her insides. Whenever the thick fingers went in and out of the little hole, a tantalizing pleasure spread throughout her body. As the speed of his fingers gradually increased, her vision started to blur and she could hear the loud squelching sounds coming from down there.\u201cOh, heung.. aak.. heung.. ah, ah!\u201dAnnette reached her peak with her head down. Raphael, after getting up, licked and bit her neck violently and groaned. The beast-like voice was intimidating but also deeply aroused Annette\u2019s desires.\u201cI just used my fingers to enter you. Did it feel that good? You\u2019re dripping wet.\u201dHis penis, which had erected all of a sudden, rubbed over her pussy. It looked terribly intimidating as if it wanted to be put inside right away. However, the inner walls of her vagina, which remembered the taste of the man, were tingling and contracting in anticipation. At that moment, Raphael, who was teasingly licking Annette\u2019s ears, whispered.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, are you clenching your insides? Do you want me to put it in so badly?\u201dAnnette\u2019s eyes turned red with shame. Seeing her bite her lips and look at him with wet eyes, Raphael stopped moving as if he was frozen. Just as Annette was wondering about his strange behavior, her body was suddenly dragged down and a large penis squeezed into her.\u201cOh, so suddenly\u2026.\u2026!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t stand it, damn it. If it hurts, just hit me.\u201dRaphael grabbed Annette\u2019s hand and placed it on his cheek. He then frowned and let out an impatient groan. The taste of the hot and moist inner walls almost drove him crazy. As he slowly moved a couple of times, the flesh that clung to him every time he took out his penis, felt really good. Unable to hold back anymore, he continued to ram into her ferociously.\u201cYou\u2019re so tight, Annette. You\u2019re clenching onto me so tightly.\u201d\u201cAh ah Raphael ah!\u201dAs he spread her ass wide, Raphael landed soft blows on it, enough to leave his handprints. He was so deep inside her that she almost felt suffocated. His large, hot penis filled her narrow walls and rubbed all the places where it felt good. Regardless of her will, her eyes filled with tears as her body was gripped by the terrible pleasure. Annette cried and begged Raphael because she could almost feel her brain melt due to the heat.\u201cYou\u2019re too fierce. Slow down a little, ah, a little slowly\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow should I slow down now when you\u2019re sticking to me like this? Is that truly what you want?Raphael sneered and again flipped her body over. His big hands raised her knees and made her pose like a bitch. Raphael began to thrust from behind in that posture. His penis roughly poked her insides with a new-found ferocity. In the new posture, he rammed deeper into her, hitting all her sensitive spots. Annette screamed as the bitter-sweet sensation of pain and pleasure rushed through her body.\u201cAh, ngh! Uh, this posture\u2026no! Oh!!\u201dThe rutting dog-like posture stimulated Annette\u2019s shame. Whenever she was stabbed by the large penis from the back, Annette felt numb with pleasure. Annette\u2019s legs, which had been overworked since morning, eventually slipped onto the sheets. Raphael reached out and cruelly rammed into her, lifting only her hips.\u201cDon\u2019t you like it? You\u2019re so tight, sucking me in like this\u2026 Ohh, it\u2019s so hot and tight that it\u2019s such a mess inside.\u201dRaphael pushed his penis all the way in and then slowly pulled it out. The feeling of his thick glans moving in and out of her while rubbing her insides felt too vivid. Just as he said, she could feel her warm insides suck his penis in. Feeling ashamed by this, Annette cried and tried to crawl away from his grasp.But Raphael was not the type to let the prey he was eating run away. He pulled Annette\u2019s arms back and plunged deeper into her hot insides. The obsession that he felt as he grasped her thin wrist was chilling but also increased his sexual appetite. The penis, moving in and out of her, brutally poked at her sensitive spots.\u201cAh, yes, ha, ang! Huh!\u201dAs the hot sparks of passion burst in every inch of her body, she clenched the sheets in desperation. Although she was begging him to stop, her body shuddered with delight instead. Annette eventually reached her climax. Tremors shook her body as she let herself go. But Raphael kept on thrusting harder and harder, cutting through the convulsing walls. Hot, white flashes of passion blinded her as she was again stimulated during her peak. The pleasure of being strongly stimulated in the sensitive places almost felt like violence.\u201cNo, now, aang! No, no, stop! Please\u2026 Ahh!!\u201dAnnette kept on crying as the familiar tingling sensation built up inside her once again. Hearing her cries, Raphael leaned down to lick her neck and bit her hard. Surprised, Annette reflexively tightened, making Raphael thrust even harder. It was so intense that she almost felt that the thickness and shape of his penis were going to be etched into her inner walls.\u201cI told you not to tighten up, Annette. Do you want me to mess you up more?\u201d\u201cNow, ah! St ..ah stop\u2026\u2026ngh!\u201dShe was afraid if they did it again, she wouldn\u2019t be able to close her legs. As he hugged Annette\u2019s weeping body, Raphael buried his raging desire deep inside her. The penis, buried in her tight walls, wriggled and spilled out hot fluids. That was the last feeling Annette felt before she lost her consciousness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The muscular man\u2019s forearms, which were hugging her body, were pretty heavy. Annette, realizing that she had slept until the afternoon, blinked her eyes.Suddenly her vision turned black and she wondered if there was a dark black hair-like curtain of darkness covering her eyes. She felt two warm lips touch her eyes.\u201cWake up. Aren\u2019t you hungry?\u201dThe voice of the man, who lay next to her languidly, was very low and sexy. Raphael, who spoke more affectionately than usual, pressed his lips down on her temple. The soft texture of his lips completely woke Annette up. As she propped herself up, the things that happened in the morning came to her mind.\u2018Oh, right! We fell asleep together last night and then in the morning\u2026\u2019Annette remembered that she had fallen asleep on the way back in the carriage right after the ball. But since she was sleeping by leaning against Raphael\u2019s body, she didn\u2019t know that Raphael had later picked her up and moved her to her bedroom. In the morning, because of this, she reflexively burrowed herself into Raphael\u2019s arms, wanting to look for warmth from his body. Recalling the events that happened in the morning, Annette bowed her head and blushed. Raphael, lying next to her, got up from the bed and examined her complexion.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you not feeling well?\u201dRaphael looked around at Annette\u2019s face, wondering if he had hugged her too roughly. Annette did not refuse his touch but looked up at him quietly. The man who had quenched his greed was now quite generous towards his woman.Annette was not very pleased with the whimsical actions of Raphael, who was again being nice to her. She thought it would be better to have a physical relationship with him. But that way, she would not be able to leave and would never be happy. Annette closed her eyes as Raphael gently swept back her hair.Annette knew that even if she left him and found new happiness, there would be days when she would miss this hand. There would be nights when she would think of his warmth and feel lonely. To get rid of this feeling, Annette asked Raphael.\u201cI have a question for you. Can I ask you?\u201dAs expected, his hands caressing her forehead, stopped. She would have rather appreciated it if Raphael had pushed her away again. Annette blinked, expecting him to turn her down. However, Raphael frowned and answered with a grimace.\u201c\u2026 You can ask me anything.\u201dIt meant that it was up to him to answer. \u2018Are you saying that I can ask any question I want?\u2019 Annette opened her mouth with her cheek resting on his big palm.\u201cI heard that the demand for iron ore has skyrocketed these days. And because of that your iron ore mine has soared in value. What do you think? Are you making good profits there?\u201d\u201cWhy? Are you interested in my mine too?\u201dInstead of answering, Raphael raised one eyebrow and asked. Annette was worried that he might misunderstand that she was coveting his mine. Annette\u2019s tone of voice rose as she quickly added her explanation.\u201cNo, Raphael. It\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s a huge industrial change, isn\u2019t it? So, I just had a few questions\u2026.\u2026\u201d\u201cI was just kidding. You don\u2019t have to be so flustered.\u201dRaphael, with the corners of his mouth raised, grabbed her blond hair and gently twisted it between his fingers. Surely if it had been in the past, he would have sarcastically accused Annette for setting her eyes on his mine. But now that he had witnessed the scene of Annette fighting with her father last time, he knew she didn\u2019t want his mine.\u2018I already know what my father wants. Whatever it is, don\u2019t even think about taking anything from Raphael. He\u2019ll never give it to you.\u2019At that time, Annette fought against her father while trembling with a pale face. It was too much to suspect Annette after seeing it. Raphael finally admitted to himself; he had already started believing in her. He gently told Annette what she was curious about.\u201cThat\u2019s right. The profits have increased a lot. There were a lot of people who wanted to buy my iron ore mine. After all, it\u2019s the largest mine in the Deltium.\u201d\u201cI see. Um\u2026 You know, Raphael\u2026. Maybe your mine has something besides financial benefits\u2026.. Are there any influential elements that could be used in politics or diplomacy?\u201dRaphael said nothing for a moment. Instead, he stretched out his arms and hugged Annette from behind. Then he started licking her neck gently. There were traces of Raphael\u2019s bites on her white nape. It was unfortunate that her slender neck was marred by his bite marks, but on the other hand, seeing his traces on her aroused dark sadistic feelings inside him. Raphael, who licked the marks to soothe her, opened his mouth.\u201cYes, it can be used to exert diplomatic influence on some countries. It\u2019s a good thing that industrial efficiency has increased with the supply of iron to the common people, but not all countries can mine iron ore. So, I am also selling a significant amount of iron ore overseas.\u201d\u201cAh, then, if someone buys your iron ore mine\u2026. they can mix a little into diplomacy and trade with certain countries.\u201dUnderstanding Raphael\u2019s words, Annette lowered her eyes. Of course, her father, Allamand, was not after the iron ore mine simply because of the financial gain. After all, the Bavarian family was one of the richest families in Deltium. What Allamand coveted was not the iron ore mine, but the influence he can exert over other countries through it.Seeing Annette deep in thought, Raphael hugged her and pulled her closer to him. The delicate Annette fit right into his arms. As Raphael looked down at her, her round head and slender neck along with her small ears that were slightly peeking out of her long blond hairs, all seemed very pretty. He had a rough idea why she was asking about his mine.\u2018In fact, I, myself didn\u2019t expect this mine to be this profitable.\u2019Raphael was really lucky. His biological father, King Selgratis, gave Raphael a diamond mine and an iron ore mine in return for his major contributions to the war. At that time, iron was too difficult to smelt and so was quite expensive. Since it was difficult to procure, its use was also limited. Therefore, the iron ore mine that Raphael received did not receive much attention. But who knew that the tides of the time would turn like this in a few years?\u2018It was probably given to me because he didn\u2019t think something like this would happen.\u2019Raphael thought cynically. His biological father, King Selgratis, apparently seemed to care a lot about Raphael. But the things he would give him were like placing silver alms in the hands of a beggar. Raphael wondered if he was mistaken because of his own feelings or it was actually what the king intended.\u201cRaphael.\u201dJust then, Annette, who was still in Raphael\u2019s arms like a doll, turned her head and called him. He looked so serious as if he had finished thinking about something. Annette reached out and grasped Raphael\u2019s hand and then sighed.\u201cI know. My father\u2026. He is coveting your mine. And because of me, you\u2019re being put into undue pressure.\u201dAfter finishing speaking, Annette dropped her head as if she was ashamed. Raphael watched her little fingers clutching the sheets painfully. When he saw this pitiful sight, generous words flowed out of his mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s really nothing before what my uncle did to you. Well father-in-law really needs to do better. As the proud blue-blooded Bavarian, he is currently second in this race.\u201dAnnette grinned at Raphael\u2019s unexpected joke. For the first time, she realised that Raphael too had similar concerns as her. Just as she was worried about her father, Raphael also seemed to have some problems with his mother\u2019s family. Perhaps that was why he could sympathize with her.She never thought that she would be able to build a connection with Raphael in her life. It was an experience that she never had in her previous life. Was this life changing little by little because of her efforts? Annette, who was fiddling with Raphael\u2019s hand, said in a determined voice.\u201cRaphael, I\u2019ll protect your mine. No one can take away what\u2019s yours. Even if it\u2019s my father.\u201dRaphael\u2019s blue eyes widened when he heard those words. Raphael, who was looking at Annette without saying anything, soon laughed out aloud. His sharp eyes curled into two small crescent moons, and his red lips, which only spoke bad words, were now pulled into a bright smile. Raphael replied, looking at Annette with blue eyes filled with amusement.\u201cThat\u2019s quite reassuring. Thanks to you, I feel very secure.\u201dAnnette warmed up to his positive response. She was determined to protect his mine before leaving him. His naked chest, his arms hugging her, his cheeks and lips pressed against her body all felt pleasantly warm. It was a pity that she would have to leave her handsome husband, but it was a better choice for both of them.Raphael only wanted a formal relationship and didn\u2019t want to involve any personal feelings. But Annette didn\u2019t want to live like that. Since this was her second life, she wanted to love and cherish someone and have a meaningful relationship with him. If Raphael refused, Annette had no choice but to leave him.But before that, she wanted to solve his mine problem.Annette\u2019s little pink lips paled a little. To be honest, it was scary and hopeless to fight against Allamand. However, she really wanted to protect Raphael. It was her way of repaying him for the kindness he showed to her when she was sick in her previous life. Also in the first place, it was her own family who was behind it.Fortunately, while Annette acted out the role of a good daughter, there were some things she saw and heard from the shadows. She knew what Allamand did to get what he wanted.Now, it was time to stop being a good daughter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, today he was wearing a normal gentleman\u2019s clothes.The black stripe suit fitted well with his tall and slim body and made him look more sophisticated and beautiful. Particularly the crimson red vest and the black silk hat adorned with colorful peacock feathers were truly unique. But Annette still couldn\u2019t forget the shocking appearance of Railin that she saw last time.\u201cMister Railin, did you return the maid\u2019s clothes that you took from our mansion last time?\u201dAnnette asked gracefully. An \u2018oops!\u2019 expression came on Railin\u2019s charming face and then soon disappeared. Having a whimsical cat-like demeanor, he paid little attention to trivial matters. Of course, the maid\u2019s uniform was included in that list. Annette, who saw this, narrowed her eyes and said.\u201cIf it\u2019s okay, I would like you to return it to the original owner. The number of uniforms given to each maid is fixed.\u201dBy now, some poor maid working for the Marquis of Carnesis must be losing her mind over her lost uniform. Since two maid\u2019s uniforms were provided to each person, she must be now embarrassed because she didn\u2019t know where her clothes had disappeared. Listening to Annette, Railin bowed down elegantly and kissed the back of her hand again.\u201cOkay, whatever you want.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you.\u201dWith a friendly but determined smile, Annette pulled out her hand from Railin\u2019s grasp. She hadn\u2019t come here to talk about the maid\u2019s outfits with him today. Annette took a book related to the temple in her arms and opened a page.\u201cAccording to my research, the temple has a system called \u2018God\u2019s Servant.\u2019 They collect orphans and poor people and use them as servants to manage the temple. Unlike the priests, they\u2019re just slaves, so they have no identities or any records. Of course, a place as big as Goddess Odessa\u2019s temple would be a little more difficult to manage, but maybe I could\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cAha! You\u2019re trying to infiltrate the temple as a servant. And are you thinking of meeting Lady Celestine, who comes to pray there? Well, since they poorly investigate the personal details of these people, you can enter the temple as a maidservant without being noticed.\u201dRailin, holding his chin smiled and said. As expected, he correctly deduced what she was thinking. Annette nodded and admitted,\u201cThat\u2019s right. Honestly, I don\u2019t know if I can be a good servant, but\u2026 I think this is the best way to do it right now. Do you have any other opinions?\u201dAnnette, who was brought up in riches, was far from a maidservant. Of course, she would do her best, but frankly speaking, she wasn\u2019t very confident. But there was no other way to infiltrate the temple. Even after searching throughout the book, using the system of \u2018God\u2019s Servant\u2019 was the easiest way for her to infiltrate.Of course, meeting Celestine was another hurdle. Even if she infiltrated the temple, it would be difficult to approach Celestine. There was no way that a servant would be allowed to approach a person like her, who was about to become the Crown Princess. However, Annette had also thought about that.\u201c\u2026Just help me infiltrate the temple for now. After that, I\u2019ll take care of everything by myself.\u201dAnnette bit her lips and said. It was not easy to sneak into a temple that was visited by the future princess. But the \u2018Secret\u2019 guild run by Railin would certainly find a way to infiltrate.Instead of answering her request immediately, Railin stared at Annette without saying a word. He looked as if he was calculating the benefits of his involvement in this work and the risks he would face if Annette failed. As Railin\u2019s silence grew, Annette asked anxiously.\u201cIs there something wrong with my plan? Or perhaps\u2026 is it impossible for you to infiltrate the temple?\u201d\u201cImpossible? Nothing is impossible for me.\u201dAnnette\u2019s question seemed to have hurt his pride. Railin smiled brightly like a poisonous flower. It was a secret, but he was one of the few remaining wizards in the world. It\u2019s just that no one knew what Railin was because he had hidden his identity using the cover of the information guild.In the first place, there was no information that couldn\u2019t fall into Railin\u2019s grasp. He was the master of the Secret Guild, which was the largest underground information guild in Deltium. However, Railin didn\u2019t detect the secret that Annette was keeping. The secret that she is a regressor. Railin, who had no idea of Annette\u2019s secret, shrugged his shoulders.\u201cOkay, I think I can help you sneak into the temple. But after that, as you said, you\u2019re on your own. We won\u2019t take responsibility for what happens later.\u201dFortunately, Railin agreed to help. Annette tried to suppress her joy and thanked him with a bright smile.\u201cThank you very much, Mister Railin. As expected, there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do. You\u2019re very competent.\u201d\u201cOf course. But if there\u2019s one thing I want to point out\u2026\u2026.\u201dWith a strange look, Railin reached for Annette like a cat. The man\u2019s delicate white hands glided along the contours of Annette\u2019s face. When his hands hovered around her as if they were going to touch her bare skin, her breathing accelerated, making the hair stand up on the back of her neck.\u201cMister Railin?\u201dAnnette called his name out as she tried to get away from his fingertips. But at that moment, Railin gently grabbed her chin. The unfamiliar fingers touching her face were cold, and there was a dreamy scent coming from them. As soon as he saw Annette\u2019s eyes widen in surprise, Railin smiled brightly. He then took his hands off her face and said in a strange tone, as if he had done nothing wrong.\u201cTo be honest with you, the idea of infiltrating as a maidservant is too reckless. Your face is too noticeable to do that. Even if you wear rags, it\u2019ll be too difficult to hide your natural elegance. With such a face, no one would believe that you\u2019re an orphan or a slave girl. So you will be caught at once.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u2026. So then what should we do?\u201dAnnette was relieved that the air around them had returned to normal. He must have put his hand on her face to look closely. Railin\u2019s appearance was so gorgeous and beautiful that it tended to mess with people\u2019s eyes. So even though his actions didn\u2019t mean much, it made people nervous just like now. Railin laughed a little when he saw the tip of Annette\u2019s ear turn slightly red.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll do something about it. I\u2019ll contact you on a suitable day to infiltrate the temple. I heard that the Odessa Louis\u2019 temple is having a harvest ritual for autumn soon. As far as I know, the priests would wear ceremonial masks in the rituals. Why don\u2019t we go for that?\u201d\u201cThe mask, that\u2019s great! It will definitely work. If we go on normal days, we will have to reveal our faces, so the chances of us getting caught will also be high but\u2026 if we go during the festive period, the mask will help us to hide. And there will be a lot of people looking for the temple, so sneaking into it will be much easier.\u201dAnnette\u2019s face brightened. It was much better to disguise yourself as one of the masked priests than to act as a maidservant. Since she could now cover her face while doing something bad, it felt a lot less burdensome psychologically. Railin, who was watching Annette\u2019s face brighten up, said slowly.\u201cI\u2019m glad you like my opinion. Do you have any more issues you\u2019d like to discuss?\u201dRailin expected that Annette would tell him that she would leave her husband and wanted to be smuggled out. Once she left Deltium, he had planned to sneak into her new life. Annette, who was just asked this question, was lost in thought. Her red lips moved enchantingly.\u201cI still have one thing I want to find out.\u201d\u201cWhat is that, my dear customer?\u201dRailin tilted his head and looked at her in anticipation. Annette\u2019s neatly combed blond hair, white round forehead, and elegant nose were really pleasing to the eye. But the question from Annette was completely unexpected.\u201cCan I find out how we can take someone else\u2019s ownership of the mine? Please don\u2019t leave out any information if possible.\u201d\u201cMine\u2019s ownership\u2026..is that what you want?\u201d\u201cYes, please find out all the legal and illegal ways.\u201dAnnette was lost in thought and did not notice Railin\u2019s weak tone. She hadn\u2019t just taken bridal lessons before marriage. Allamand wanted to make her a perfect princess and gave his daughter an excessive higher education. Thanks to him, Annette knew more than what her father expected. Especially about how he gets what he wants.However, Annette did not know the law regarding the ownership of the mine, so she needed some help from Railin. Surely it was quite difficult to contact Railin, but whenever she successfully did, she was always satisfied. The \u2018Secret\u2019 Guild was Deltium\u2019s top information guild that provided thorough services when paid. And Annette had enough money to commission them. So eventually a good synergy was formed between both of them in this deal.\u201cAs you wish.\u201dRailin, who let out a faint sigh, smiled and accepted her request. The lady sitting in front of him had an innocent and graceful face that could not kill a single worm. But every step she made was really extraordinary and exciting.\u2018I wish you would take your husband\u2019s mine.\u2019Well, he didn\u2019t think that would happen. Railin, who had a rough grip on Annette\u2019s personal affairs, clicked his tongue in annoyance. Until she came to visit him, she had a pretty bad relationship with her husband. However, the relationship seemed to be improving these days. He had heard two reports of Annette accompanying her husband at a recent ball. It was a real shame. But \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u201cThen I look forward to your kind cooperation. Mister Railin, thank you so much for your help.\u201dAnnette\u2019s smiling face, as she stood up from her seat, shined like the sun. Her heartfelt words of gratitude wrapped in his ears and sounded as sweet as honey. Her honest eyes showed no greed or trickery. That\u2019s why Railin liked her.Laughing helplessly, Railin said goodbye and kissed the back of her hand. The red lips, which concealed their greed, fell covetously on the back of her white hands.\u201cI look forward to seeing you again, my special customer.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Looking at the fabric alone, the overall ensemble did not seem much luxurious, but it did look a little excessive. However, the bodice and sleeves of the dress were made of a dark red velvet fabric, giving it a heavy sense of frivolity. The dark red velvet gloves, which were made of the same material, were pulled up to the elbows. Somehow it looked bewitching.Raphael thought that Annette today looked just like a ripe cranberry in autumn. His mouth watered when he imagined the sour and ripe taste. At this point, all the thoughts about his mine vanished from his mind. He only wanted to pull down Annette\u2019s dress, which sparkled like a high-end gift wrapper. He felt like he was going crazy.Completely ignorant of the raging thoughts in Raphael\u2019s head, Annette looked out of the carriage with a nervous look. The destination was getting closer. She opened her mouth as if she had suddenly remembered something and held both her hands anxiously.\u201cThank you for letting me see your mine manager, Raphael\u2026. The fact that you trust me enough to let me handle this work\u2026 I really appreciate it. I truly mean it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dRaphael felt guilty. There was a pin prick feeling in his chest. In fact, he was really sorry for not trusting Annette sooner. But Annette still thanked him and treated him well without any resentment.As a result, Raphael felt uncomfortable and his expression hardened. He wanted to treat Annette better, but he didn\u2019t know what to do, as he had never been good to any woman in his life. In the midst of this, the carriage continued to move and finally stopped in front of Raphael\u2019s mining office.\u201cOh, we arrived earlier than I thought.\u201dAnnette pressed her palms over her pounding heart. Annette had always led a passive life, like a flower in the greenhouse. Who would have thought that she was now going to cheat others to protect someone!\u2018My heart is pounding.\u2019Annette took a deep breath. If she said she wasn\u2019t scared, it would be a flat-out lie. But now, she had no choice but to trust herself and move forward. After taking Raphael\u2019s hand, she got off the carriage and said goodbye to him. Annette\u2019s voice was just as sweet as honey. She was really grateful that Raphael accompanied her to the destination.\u201cI\u2019ll be right back, Raphael. Please wish me luck.Raphael nodded. To avoid the possibility of getting caught, Raphael decided to go home and wait. But he kept on looking at her as if he had something to say. Raphael\u2019s blue eyes darkened a little and his mouth moved. The words, which took a long time to come out, clumsily flowed out of his mouth.\u201cHave a safe trip.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAnnette smiled brightly with her eyes curled like half moons. She turned around and stepped forward to enter the mining office. But Raphael didn\u2019t let go of her hand. As he grasped her small hands in his large ones, an unknown lingering feeling arose inside him.\u201cRaphael\u2026?Annette looked back at him with her head slightly tilted. However, Raphael just blinked and looked at her dumbly. It seemed he didn\u2019t realise that he was holding Annette\u2019s hand. When Annette\u2019s gaze moved down to their intertwined hands, Raphael got surprised and quickly let go.\u201cWell, good-bye.\u201dRaphael spat out the words and quickly turned away. His sudden actions seemed as if he disliked Annette. It looked even more so because of his cold-looking features and stubborn eyebrows. However, Annette had already experienced this Raphael in her previous life. If he really didn\u2019t like her, he wouldn\u2019t have held her hand or said goodbye.\u2018Most of all, he wouldn\u2019t have trusted me and let me handle this job.\u2019Annette was most pleased about that. The iron ore mine was now Raphael\u2019s biggest asset. And the person aiming for it was none other than her own father, Allamand. In this situation, it was obvious how difficult it must have been for Raphael to leave this job to her. And that sceptical Raphael, who didn\u2019t trust anyone, believed in her\u2026.The more she thought about it, the more she felt like crying, so she decided to focus on what she should do now. She hurried her steps into the office without looking back. Now, she only wanted to focus on what was ahead. So Annette didn\u2019t see with what kind of expression Raphael, who was left behind, was looking at her.\u201cOh, ma\u2019am! You came as promised. It is such an honor to have you here! It makes me feel like this dark mine has brightened up!! My name is Thomas Bradley. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you!\u201dThe middle-aged man, who ran out to the entrance, bent down in an excessively flattering manner. Annette grinned and looked up and down at him. His head was shiny as he didn\u2019t have a lot of hair, but his beard was as thick and dark as a young man, which was really impressive. The hair roots were concentrated down his face. But it would have been much better if the condition of the top and bottom of his face was reversed. How unfortunate!Annette knew his face. Of course, she had seen some things about him in Railin\u2019s report, but Annette had known Thomas before that. There was no way she wouldn\u2019t remember such a man with such a sad hairline.\u2018Yes, he\u2019s one of my father\u2019s servants. I remember seeing him go in and out of the mansion before.\u201dIt was fortunate that Allamand had underestimated his daughter. He didn\u2019t tell Annette publicly about his \u201cbusiness,\u201d but he also didn\u2019t hide it. It was because he didn\u2019t feel the need to do so in the first place. Allamand only thought of the obedient Annette as his possession. Thanks to him, Annette knew more than he thought.\u2018Thomas Bradley? It\u2019s probably not his real name.\u2019Annette blinked and looked at Thomas. She wondered if he would recognize her as Allamand\u2019s daughter. But Thomas was also not an easy opponent. She couldn\u2019t read anything from his grinning face. So Annette smiled brightly and said hello.\u201cNice to meet you, Mr. Bradley. I heard you\u2019re quite good at your job. I\u2019m glad to have an informative conversation today with you about the direction of the mine\u2019s business. Now that I\u2019ve seen you in person, you\u2019re so manly and wonderful!\u201dAnnette\u2019s attitude for dealing with employees was too friendly. She looked at Thomas as if she was seeing her first love in ten years. Thomas felt a little embarrassed, but he soon recovered his composure and answered back.\u201cOf course! I must do well for the Marquis, who entrusted me with this mine. It\u2019s an honor to know that my hard work is appreciated.\u201dThomas was not an easy man either. He was the man that Raphael had hired to manage the mine shortly after he received it. It will not be an exaggeration to say that Raphael\u2019s iron ore mine was now in Thomas\u2019s hands.Raphael was a man who had won the title of a nobleman on his own, but the problems in this situation only came forward afterwards. Becoming an aristocrat was much more difficult than he thought. Especially as he was an emerging aristocrat who had just created a new family name.Raphael had to make a lot of decisions as a new aristocrat\u2014where his mansion would be built, how large it should be, how many employees should be hired, how the land would be managed, how the tax rate would be applied, and etc. On top of that, he also had to manage the mines that he had received. It was literally impossible to manage all this alone. Raphael, who had only wielded the sword throughout his life, could not manage the matters regarding the daily mining volume of the mine, the supplier, and the profitability of the business.So Raphael decided to hire a manager to take care of the diamond mine and iron ore mine he received. And the problem started from there.\u2018Since then, my father has already planted his people.\u2019Annette, who pretended to know nothing in front of Thomas, smiled at him. At that time, diamonds were far more precious than iron ore. So, Raphael only focused on the diamond mine. Because of this, the manager of the iron ore mine was selected \u2018appropriately\u2019. Thomas, who was so chosen, was none other than Allamand\u2019s servant.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go inside! I\u2019ve prepared a very nice tea for today\u2019s special conversation. We also have various kinds of scones that are good to eat with it! I really hope you have a fun time today.\u201d\u201cOh, how kind of you! Then I\u2019ll gratefully accept the invitation. Shall we go?\u201dAnnette grinned as she looked at Thomas\u2019 bald head gleaming in the sun. Perhaps because of the glare from the reflective surface, the corners of her eyes curved more naturally. Thomas, who didn\u2019t know anything, relaxed at seeing Annette\u2019s amiable expression.Annette followed him into his private parlour. The office attached with a reception room was quite spacious and tidy. From its decor, Thomas looked like an upright person. However, Annette looked carefully around the room and found a door in the back of the parlour. Her eyes glistened on seeing it.\u2018If I want to hide something, I would definitely hide it there.\u2019Annette, who pretended to be innocent, chatted with Thomas in a consistent friendly manner. Seeing her subtle and outspoken demeanor, Thomas almost asked her \u2018Are you interested in me?\u2019 After exchanging some chatter with each other, Thomas finally got to the main topic.\u201cBy the way, ma\u2019am, why do you have questions about the mining business? I apologize if this question is rude. But most people like you, are generally not interested in mines like this\u2026\u2026.\u201dFinally, the question that Annette had been waiting for came up. The important thing began from now on. Annette, who shrugged her shoulders, leaned back on the sofa and made an unusually arrogant face. The corners of her eyes curled a little, giving a crafty look to Thomas.\u201cOh, no I\u2019m actually very interested. Especially when it comes to his mines.\u201dAnnette, who lowered her voice, whispered greedily. Just like a woman who coveted her husband\u2019s mines.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was even dubious about what he had heard. Suspecting Annette\u2019s intentions, Thomas said nonchalantly,\u201cOh, are you? I\u2019m sure Marquis would be very pleased to hear that. His wife not only cares about the household but also the operations of his mine! As a fellow man, I really envy the Marquis. Hehe!\u201dThomas laughed loudly, but the tips of his eyebrows were slightly twitching. From Thomas\u2019s point of view, her interest could not be entertained. Even though Raphael was the owner, Thomas was able to do whatever he wanted because Raphael had left all the mining operations to him and did not pay much attention. But if the ownership of the mine gets in the hands of Annette, he would be left with nothing. Naturally, his eyes, looking at Annette, were filled with caution.After seeing this, Annette raised her hand gracefully and held her chin. Then a large diamond tucked over her velvet glove gave off a dazzling glow. It was an excessive design that she never would have worn if it was her usual self. However, it was also a good bait to attract attention. As soon as Thomas\u2019s gaze turned to the diamond, Annette smiled arrogantly.\u201cThat\u2019s right. He has little interest in mines. So\u2026 Shouldn\u2019t something precious belong to someone who recognizes its value? What do you think, Mr. Bradley?\u201d\u201c\u2026What? Excuse me, Madam, what are you talking about? Well, I can\u2019t understand\u2026\u201dAnnette looked at the embarrassed Thomas with an even more charming smile. It was the smile that she had learned from Railin. It was only for this moment that she had intentionally dressed up in fancy clothes and shown Thomas too much attention. Annette, lazily leaning her head, whispered with a gleam in her eyes.\u201cI mean, I think I can do a lot better if I become the owner of the mine. Whether it\u2019s regarding its operations or profits. And maybe\u2026 also give the loyal employees who helped me, plenty of my \u2018sincerity\u2019?\u201dWhen Thomas heard Annette\u2019s suggestion, his eyes became wide open with shock. He looked as if he had never expected to hear something like this from her. After seeing this, Annette became more confident. It seemed she was doing a good job in acting. Annette, with her head tilted, smiled like a cat and further cornered Thomas.\u201cWhat do you think, Mr. Bradley? Are you willing to help me out?\u201d\u201cMadam, that\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s so sudden, I\u2019m not sure how to answer.\u201dThomas\u2019s bald head gleamed with embarrassment. In fact, from his current standpoint, he couldn\u2019t help but be embarrassed. He had come here as Raphael\u2019s mine manager at the order of Allamand. But the employer\u2019s daughter suddenly stepped in, saying that she too wanted the mine. So it was a bit embarrassing. After putting Thomas into a spot, just like she wanted, Annette decided to step back.\u201cI think you need time to think, Mr. Bradley.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m so sorry, but I can\u2019t give you an answer right now.\u201dThomas, who was sweating a lot, analyzed her words and bit her bait. In response, Annette nodded and pretended to be sullen for not receiving an answer. There was an awkward silence between the two, but it was soon broken by Annette.\u201cThen Mr. Bradley. I heard you say you\u2019re from West Deilun?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, ma\u2019am. Do you know about Deilun?\u201dThomas answered Annette\u2019s question with a confident smile. \u2018He must have forged his hometown as well.\u2019 It seemed he was also a good actor. Annette decided to be generous with him. She was cheating Thomas anyway. Annette with a curious look asked by tilting her head.\u201cThere\u2019s a traditional song that\u2019s popular in the Deilun area, isn\u2019t there? I listened to it by chance before. It was really rich in notes and was more pleasant to hear than I thought. But maybe it was because the lyrics were unfamiliar, I couldn\u2019t understand what the song meant. Since Mr. Bradley is from there, you should know the meaning, right?\u201d\u201cMeaning of the traditional song? Ah\u2026. yes.\u201dA drop of sweat trickled down from Thomas\u2019s dazzling head. Although he had memorized the specialties of the fake hometown and famous names related to it, he didn\u2019t know much about the traditional songs. But it was okay. Annette also didn\u2019t know anyway.\u2018Ah, it\u2019s all made up.\u2019Annette smiled, concealing her thoughts. Then she asked Thomas, naively blinking her eyes as if she was not at all suspicious of him.\u201cYes. I\u2019m not good enough at singing, but would you like to hear it? I really want to know the meaning of that enchanting song.\u201d\u201cOh, yes, yes! Of course, I would like to hear it!\u201dThomas, whose face became red, nodded knowingly. He was very embarrassed because he knew nothing about the traditional songs of Deilun. He wondered what he would do if he got caught because of this and his identity was exposed. But on the other hand, he was also grateful to hear Annette sing it for him first. After listening to the song, he could make some meaning out of it, right?\u201cWell, it\u2019s somewhat embarrassing, but I\u2019ll sing a little bit.\u201dAnnette cleared her throat, pretending to be unaware of Thomas\u2019s feelings. Then Thomas, with a flattering smile, bowed his head and leaned in a little to focus on her singing. After confirming this, Annette opened her mouth and began to sing a random song.\ud83c\udfb6The morning sun is golden.The afternoon sun is whiteThe evening sun is red.And when the moon rises, everything disappears\ud83c\udfb6It was just a random song, but its effect was clear. Thomas, who was leaning forward, fell asleep on the table and snored loudly. Annette, who confirmed this, quickly got up from her seat.\u2018I don\u2019t have much time. I have to quickly find the evidence that could prove Thomas is a traitor.\u2019As a regressor, Annette\u2019s \u201cspecial ability\u201d was to put people to sleep. Fortunately, the ability was instantaneous, so most of the people fell asleep in 30 seconds. However, the only flaw in this was that it was difficult to estimate the duration of the ability.If the opponent was as sleep-deprived as Raphael, the ability lasted for a longer duration. However, if she forced a sober person to sleep, the effect did not last for more than five minutes. Therefore, she had to move as fast as possible in situations like this.Annette looked around the parlour and searched everything that stood out. But there was nothing on the shelves near the table or on the bookshelves. According to Railin\u2019s report, Thomas didn\u2019t get a house around here. Instead, Thomas shared a room and board in this large mining office building.\u2018Then the only thing left to search is there.\u201dShe approached the back door that she had noticed earlier. Perhaps inside this door was Thomas\u2019s personal living space. But the door was tightly locked. Annette hurried back to Thomas and searched his arms carefully.\u2018Key, key\u2026 I found it!\u2019She felt something similar to a key when she looked in the inner pocket of Thomas\u2019s right vest. But Thomas fell asleep in a precarious position on the table. So she was unable to take out the key from his inner pocket. Annette grunted and then lifted Thomas by grabbing him by the shoulder. Fortunately, after much effort, she was able to take the key out of his vest pocket, but there was another problem.\u201cUmmm\u2026.\u201dThomas, who frowned, showed signs of awakening. The sounds of his loud snoring had disappeared. Frustrated, Annette quickly sang and put him back to sleep. She was doubtful whether it will work again on the person she had already used it on. But fortunately, Thomas fell asleep again. As he started snoring again, Annette breathed a sigh of relief.\u2018I almost got in trouble there.\u2019Her hands trembled as she felt the danger of this work. It was a very tense moment for Annette, who had always lived as a good child and like a flower in a greenhouse. But now there was no time to hesitate. Annette, grasping the warm key, hurriedly opened the door behind the parlour. Inside, there was a bedroom with a slightly stale smell.\u2018Please, I hope I can find any evidence\u2026\u2026!\u2019Annette went into Thomas\u2019s bedroom, praying earnestly. She wanted to bring some gain to Raphael, who had entrusted her with this job. And at this opportunity, she also hoped that she could cut off her father\u2019s paws extending toward Raphael.Fortunately, her prayers were soon answered.* * *\u201cThank you very much for forgiving my rudeness, madam.\u201dThomas, who got up after falling asleep, blushed deeply. Then his head turned red, making him look like a big boiled octopus. Annette politely took her gaze off his bald head and smiled generously.\u201cOh, it was because you were tired. I know Mr. Bradley works very hard for the mining business.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really grateful for your generosity. Well, I\u2019ll think seriously about your request. So please give me a little time.\u201dThomas lowered his voice and whispered, to which Annette nodded with a subtle glance. He still seemed to believe that Annette was a greedy woman who coveted her husband\u2019s mine. She was sure he would tell her father about this and ask him what to do.But it didn\u2019t really matter. The evidence of Thomas\u2019s embezzlement was hidden inside the large hem of Annette\u2019s dress. Thomas would be done for as soon as she returned to Raphael with this. So he won\u2019t have a chance to get a reply from Allamand. Annette smiled gracefully, suppressing her still pounding chest.\u201cGood-bye, then Mr. Bradley. It was really nice meeting you.\u201d\u201cIt was an honor for me too, madam. Then please be careful on your way home.\u201dThomas didn\u2019t realize that Annette was saying goodbye instead of \u2018see you soon\u2019. He thought she had said it wrong and just simply shrugged it off.And that was the last time \u2018Thomas Bradley\u2019 saw Annette.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/How to Tame My Beastly HusbandChapter 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRaphael, who went home first as promised, practiced his sword in the training camp. However, compared to the drops of sweat dripping down his face, the efficiency of his training was not very good. Now his head was full of worries about Annette. He knew she was a very cautious person, so she would never do anything dangerous. Still, he couldn\u2019t help but worry about her.Raphael sighed and let go of the sword he was holding. It was dangerous to wield a sword in such a state. With one wrong step, he could fall on his own sword. \u2018I need to become a Sword Master as soon as possible, but why is it so slow?\u2019 It was so frustrating.\u2018I\u2019m in pretty good shape these days.\u2019His condition was far much better from what it had been before when he suffered from chronic sleep deprivation. It was perfectly peaceful to fall asleep by Annette\u2019s side every night. He didn\u2019t know why, but whenever he fell asleep in her bedroom, he did not suffer from sleepwalking.Raphael did not know that Annette would sing and put him to sleep whenever he was suffering from his sleep disorders. He simply believed that he had recovered from his illness and that Annette was his mysterious cure. Perhaps it was because he had found a peace of mind in this relationship with her. Otherwise, he couldn\u2019t explain this strange situation where he would sleep well if he was on good terms with her and would have insomnia if they were on bad terms.\u2018By the way, Annette is too late\u2026\u2019Raphael realized that he was circling around the same spot. Although Thomas, the mine manager, was far from the type to try anything, he was still a man. What if he raised his hand on Annette on being discovered! It was really foolish to send Annette alone. Raphael was so anxious that he was about to leave the place to get her.\u201cRaphael!\u201dThe voice coming from behind his back was as cheerful and happy as a lark. As he turned his head, he could see Annette coming towards him from a distance. She, who had always walked gracefully, was now running towards him with all her might. The well-braided blonde hair became disheveled, and the long dress fluttered in the air like a flower. But the flushed cheeks and eyes of Annette seemed to have no concern for this.Raphael looked at Annette\u2019s face as if he was bewitched and opened his arms unknowingly. Then Annette, who had sprinted from a distance, jumped into his arms and gasped for air. A pleasant shock hit his body, and he felt her soft arms curl around him like vines. Annette raised her head and shouted gleefully.\u201cI succeeded, Raphael!\u201dExcited, Annette took out a bunch of papers from under the hem of her large dress. Raphael, who received it, felt Annette\u2019s lingering warmth on the document and his face slightly reddened. Annette, who knew nothing about this, explained her success in a high-pitched voice.\u201cThis is a double ledger that Thomas Bradley hid. He has been giving fake business reports to you all this time. Here\u2019s the amount of embezzled money he\u2019s been steadily siphoning over the past several months.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of data. How didn\u2019t I manage to catch it?\u201dRaphael pressed his tongue to the inside of his cheek and checked the thickness of the paper. \u2018How did this come from underneath her dress? Is it magic?\u2019 Annette smiled awkwardly when she saw Raphael\u2019s surprised expression. She had actually thought of this method after seeing Railin\u2019s maid outfit.Since the hem of a woman\u2019s dress was so big, it was easy to hide something under it. Even if it was noticeable, who would dare to go ahead and examine under the skirt of a Lady? Annette purposely wore a rustling dress with a big hem. It was to hide the sounds of documents that might be heard. Thanks to that, Thomas couldn\u2019t even guess what was hidden under her dress.\u201cRaphael, I went over this paper on the way here\u2026. This is a pretty long-term and detailed plan. Thomas Bradley was going to steadily deteriorate your mining business over the years. So that it would fall into enormous debts and you would be forced to auction it off to someone else.\u201dAfter speaking, Annette smiled sadly. If that had happened, it was obvious who the new owner of the mine would be. If she hadn\u2019t intervened, an iron ore mine would have also been added to the Duke of Bavaria\u2019s property list in the future. And her father would have laughed at them coldly, just like a snake that had swallowed its prey.Annette sighed deeply. Allamand\u2019s method was to work hard for several years to bring the mine down and then swallow it all at once. So Annette began her investigation with the mine manager. If Thomas wasn\u2019t the spy, she had planned to next investigate the mine site supervisor. Afterwards, she was going to investigate the deputy director and everyone involved with the mining business one by one. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t have to do it as she caught the big fish in her first try.Annette suddenly wondered whether after her death in her previous life, Raphael could keep the mine till the end. Since her father\u2019s plan was quite long, Annette in her previous life died without seeing the results. However, there was no way to check it now. At least in this life, Annette\u2019s only consolation was that she got to know about this early and was able to prevent it in time.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that we got to know this earl, Raphael. Your iron ore business is now safe.\u201dAnnette blushed with shame and whispered in a small voice. As the joy of success subsided, she could see the reality before her eyes and her blood turned cold. It was her father who was behind all this, so she had no face to look at Raphael. When her pink eyes distorted as if she was about to cry, Raphael saw it and held her up. Then, in a curt tone, he tried to soothe her.\u201cShh, why are you crying? You did a good job.\u201d\u201cBut, Raphael, my father almost ruined your business.\u201dEven though she did well this time, will Allamand give up the mine just because she got rid of Thomas? Annette was very worried about that. Tears welled up in her eyes as she felt a mixture of fear and guilt. Raphael started panicking when he saw that her tears were about to fall. Naturally, his tone of soothing Annette became a little faster.\u201cWhat are you sorry about? You saved my business from going bankrupt. Come on, let\u2019s go find the money stolen by this damn manager. And last time didn\u2019t you want a blue diamond? Let\u2019s go buy that too.\u201d\u201cDiamonds?\u201d\u201cYeah. I haven\u2019t gifted you anything aside from those stupid flowers I collected last time. As your husband, I\u2019ve wanted to buy you something at least once. If you want, you can buy whatever color of diamond you want.\u201dRaphael sneakily tried to coax her using his wealth. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t make eye contact with Annette. He was grateful that he still had a sulky look on his face. Raphael, who was not honest, looked more shy than he usually looked. Annette, who looked at his brusque face with tearful eyes, finally laughed.\u201cBut it was a pretty flower. You were the first one to pick a flower for me. Thank you very much, Raphael.\u201dRaphael\u2019s temples turned a little red on hearing Annette\u2019s affectionate words. The redness that appeared on the cold, snowy white skin was more pronounced. Under the broad daylight, there was no darkness to cover his face. Pretending not to have seen it, Annette asked carefully.\u201cSo what are you going to do about Thomas Bradley?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ll think about it now.\u201dRaphael carefully lowered Annette, who had stopped crying, to the ground. Then he picked up the double ledger that she had stolen. He didn\u2019t know how she found this, but Annette was quite competent, unlike her modest appearance. Maybe she was better than him, who only knew how to wield a sword.Raphael\u2019s eyes gradually sharpened as he looked down at the ledger book. It was a different feeling to hear Annette\u2019s suspicions regarding Thomas, and to actually see the result. Looking at the systematic plan, he was overwhelmed with anger. This way that jerk wanted his business to go bankrupt so that he could take away his mine.\u2018That greedy jerk wants to add more to his piece.\u2019Raphael felt he needed more power. He was an excellent prosecutor and a brilliant Major with several military achievements in the war. But the war of independence in Lehtan was now all over. He had finished it with his own hands.After the hunt, the useless hounds were eaten. Luckily Raphael was a human, but it was clear that his status and property were now in jeopardy. So this time, he had to prove his new usefulness and gain the power to protect himself. All of his enemies were great men who were difficult to fight.\u201cWell done, Annette, I\u2019ll take care of the rest. Now go in and rest.\u201dRaphael bowed his head and kissed Annette\u2019s cheek affectionately. The blond hair that touched his fingertips and the soft cheeks under his lips were precious to him. To protect Annette, he had to be stronger.* * *\u2018I can hear the sound of rain from outside.\u2019Annette, sitting in a cafe in the posh shopping district, looked out of the window with a steaming herbal tea in her hand. Raphael thought she was out shopping for the jewels, but this was a trick. Annette had actually come here to meet Railin.\u2018I told you I was ready.\u2019It was early autumn. They would soon hold a ritual at the Temple of Odessa Louis to pray for a bountiful harvest. Since the autumn harvest ritual there was a quite famous occasion, Annette was planning to take this opportunity to infiltrate the temple. No one would know about the identity of Annette if she went in as one of the masked priests.Annette stared out of the window, waiting for Railin. At that moment, there was a scene that caught Annette\u2019s eye. The first thing that stood out was a beautiful and colorful umbrella. The red lace-covered umbrella was full of pale purple butterflies. Maybe it was sprinkled with diamond powder, but the wings of the butterfly twinkled brightly whenever the umbrella moved.But even those butterflies couldn\u2019t be more glamorous than the face of the man holding the umbrella.\u201c\u2026Mr. Railin?\u201dAs soon as the name was called, Railin looked this way. The white face, under the dark red shadow was as colorful as a red butterfly. He didn\u2019t smile at her as usual and looked very grim.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She wondered why he had such a dark look on his face. The moment their eyes met, Railin suddenly smiled at Annette. His face immediately turned bright as usual.\u2018He sure didn\u2019t look happy. Did I see it wrong?\u2019Annette tilted her head. Railin approached her while playfully twirling his umbrella. With a window between them, he stopped and greeted her in a slightly different way than usual.\u201cGive me the grace of the goddess, O\u2019 servant of the faithful goddess.\u201dThe greeting that Railin just said was only used to greet the priests serving the Goddess Odessa. Annette, who understood his joke, grinned and replied in the same way.\u201cThe breath of the goddess will always be with you, O\u2019 Lamb of the devout Goddess.\u201dSeeing Annette accept the joke, Railin nodded satisfactorily and entered the cafe. Despite the rain, there was no trace of any water splashing on Railin\u2019s pale gray trousers. Annette asked, looking at this curiously.\u201cDo I have to use magic to become a Secret Guild Master? Like walking on water or something.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. After all, a charming beauty like me needs to have some secrets.\u201dWith a mysterious smile, Railin pretended to show off his beauty. It was a unique charm of Railin but she didn\u2019t dislike it. However, Annette hadn\u2019t come here to crack jokes with Railin.\u201cSo, have you set a date for the infiltration?\u201d\u201cOf course. A week from now, it will be the second day of the harvest festival. We will meet at the Western Burial Tomb, a little far from the Odessa Louis temple. Very few people come there.\u201dAnnette nodded her head. Well, though the festival was said to be celebrated for giving ancestral worship, the period of harvest ahead was celebrated no different from a carnival. On such a fine day, there would not be many mourners wandering around the graves. Annette asked Railin just to make sure.\u201cAre you sure Celestine Keers will come to the temple that day?\u201d\u201cHas my information ever gone wrong?\u201dRailin asked back with a dizzying smile, with his eyes curved beautifully under the long eyelashes. Annette nodded at the fairly reliable answer. While lost in thought, Annette caressed the rim of the warm teacup and muttered,\u201cRecently, Celestine rarely socializes. I heard that because of this, people are doubting her qualifications to be a Crown Princess.\u201d\u201cWell, yes. After all, her family doesn\u2019t have that much power to support her for that position. There\u2019s a rumor going around here that she\u2019s showing signs of social phobia these days. Thanks to this, she seems to be getting a lot of resentment from her acquaintances. Of all the things, this came out as soon as she was confirmed to be the Crown Princess. It seems to everyone it\u2019s the so-called case of \u2018After she has succeeded, she has changed\u2018.\u2026\u201dRailin explained by acting it out and skillfully changing his voice. Annette frowned at the words. Come to think of it, Celestine also suddenly canceled her attendance at the garden party of Marquis Eloque. Something was off.\u201cWhy is Celestine acting so carelessly now?\u2019Annette, who suspected Celestine as the real culprit, was puzzled. Now, Celestine had finally got the position of the Crown Princess that she wanted so much. However, at this time with her goal so close, Annette couldn\u2019t understand why she was suddenly throwing away the prepared soup handed out to her.Well, it didn\u2019t matter. She would eventually know all this when she confronts her anyway. The lingering desire to clear all the false accusations against her was the only reason keeping Annette here. If she was lucky, she might get the answer right away from her encounter with Celestine. And after that\u2026\u2026.Annette smiled when she recalled her prepared plans for the future. Unlike her bitter mood, her voice flowed out smoothly as usual.\u201cMister Railin, if you don\u2019t mind, could you please prepare for me to move to Osland? I\u2019d like to visit the place, once this is all over. I have to check it out since I\u2019ll be living there from now on.\u201dFinally! Railin\u2019s ruby red eyes twinkled with joy.After finishing her conversation with Railin, Annette headed to the carriage without much thought. It was time to go back to the mansion. It was a rainy day, and if she delayed any longer, Raphael would get worried. Annette laughed at herself for having delusions that \u2018Raphael would care about her\u2019. She wondered when this started to happen.Annette quickened her steps and finally reached the front of the carriage. It was raining, so the leather boots that she wore had become soaked. The moisture sticking between her toes felt unpleasant. Just as she was about to get into the carriage, someone called her from behind.\u201cLady\u2026\u2026 No, Marchioness.\u201dThe young man\u2019s voice mixed with a foreign accent sounded very aristocratic. After waiting for her for quite a while, the man was completely soaked in the rain. Annette was surprised to see who it was. The young man, whose neatly done blond hair was sticking to his pale forehead, was someone she didn\u2019t expect.\u201cGerard? Oh my, don\u2019t you have an umbrella? It\u2019s raining so hard, what are you doing?\u201dIt was Gerard, the butler of the Bavarian family, who was waiting for her. Annette, surprised by Gerard\u2019s pitiful appearance of a wet mouse, grabbed his hand. Gerard\u2019s hands were cold from being out for so long in the rain. She wanted him to come inside the carriage to warm himself up before his temperature dropped further, but Gerard refused.\u201cIt\u2019ll ruin the leather covers, Madam. It\u2019s okay, so I\u2019ll just\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about! Do I look like a person who can\u2019t buy new leather covers? It\u2019s all right, come on, get in.\u201dWhile scolding him, Annette pulled his hand in a determined manner and then made him sit inside the carriage. Gerard was her father\u2019s trusted butler and he took care of her for a long time. Although she was now a little distant from him, she had always thought of him as a distant cousin. So to leave Gerard in the rain, while she talked with him sitting comfortably in the carriage, she wasn\u2019t that heartless.Suddenly being pulled into the carriage by Annette made Gerard finally laugh. He could feel the fine leather covers getting wet under his clothes. It was a little cold in the rain, but his heart warmed up from her kindness. His young lady was as sweet and gentle as she used to be.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Gerard? You came all the way here. Did my father make you do it?\u201dAnnette asked while covering Gerard\u2019s body with a blanket. Her heart thumped, wondering whether her father, Allamand, was going to send her another warning note. But Gerard shook his head and glanced intently at Annette. A small shadow covered his graceful face.\u201cMy Lady, no\u2026\u2026Madam.\u201d\u201cJust call me whatever you like. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I heard this by accident. The\u2026\u2026 the mine of your husband. I heard you kicked out the mine manager.\u201dAnnette\u2019s heart started pounding. The news of her handling Thomas Bradley, her father\u2019s subordinate, had reached his ears. She had expected it, but never thought it would happen so fast.Annette now wondered how much she could trust Gerard, who was also her father\u2019s subordinate. He would definitely never harm her as he had cared for her since she was a child. But it was different for her husband, Raphael. Annette warily asked Gerard,\u201cAah right. Are you asking why he did that? Thomas kept a double ledger and tried to siphon off the profits of the mining business. From a business owner\u2019s point of view, it is natural to fire such people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just because of that, My Lady. You\u2019re a smart person, so you must have already guessed everything.\u201dGerard smiled bitterly. He knew the real reason Annette kicked Thomas out. Annette stared straight at Gerard\u2019s face, not knowing what would happen. Then Gerard sighed deeply and knelt on the floor of the carriage.\u201cI\u2019m not here to harm you or your husband today. Actually, I will quit this job and return to my hometown tomorrow. Before that, I wanted to say goodbye to you, so I apologize for coming here all of a sudden.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going home? Why?\u201d\u201cMy life in Deltium was great, but now it seems it\u2019s time to return to my native country. My brother, who just took over the estate, also needs help.\u201dGerard did not give his reasons for leaving. Maybe it was because his plate of troubles got too big and he felt a sense of crisis, or maybe he was uncomfortable with the situation where he had to keep confronting her. Of course, there was also a possibility that it was a lie to bring down Annette\u2019s guard. However, his candid tone and detached face felt sincere.Just like how he knew Annette well, Annette too knew him very well. Although they had some conflicts in the middle, the time spent with Gerard was very long. It could even be exaggerated that the time spent with Gerard was much longer than the time she spent with her father. During those times, Gerard had consistently been a good butler. Now that he was leaving, she couldn\u2019t continue to treat him coldly.\u201cI see. Please be careful on your way. I hope we can meet again, Gerard.Annette bid her farewell in a soft tone and hid her regret. But Gerard\u2019s visit wasn\u2019t just for saying goodbyes. With Annette in front of him, he suddenly looked around. Then he pushed the window of the half-open carriage. Gerard then lowered his voice and whispered very carefully.\u201cLady, although I don\u2019t know everything\u2026\u2026 but I\u2019ve found one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you talking about all of a sudden, Gerard?\u201d\u201cThe mine. It\u2019s not just the Master, but there are some other people who are helping him. It\u2019s a much more dangerous and bigger conspiracy than what the Lady thought.\u201dAnnette\u2019s eyes widened at the unexpected words. Allamand, the Duke of Bavaria, alone, was a great power. The self-righteous man didn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help. She couldn\u2019t believe that Allamand had someone\u2019s help in planning something. It was totally unexpected.\u201cWould you mind telling me more about this, Gerard? I really appreciate it, but if you get caught\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhile Annette was trembling with anxiety, she was very worried about Gerard. Although she was just trying to protect Raphael, she regretted being too harsh on him. Gerard chuckled sadly and shrugged his shoulders.\u201cWell, what can they do with someone who\u2019s already gone? There\u2019s something else I really want to tell you.\u201dGerard, kneeling on the floor of the carriage, bowed his head. Then he kissed Annette\u2019s rain-soaked boots without any hesitation. At his reverent attitude, Annette\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. He looked up at Annette, still being on his knees, and smiled grimly.\u201cI sincerely apologize for insulting your husband the other day. That day, I felt like I had been robbed of my precious young lady whom I had brought up. I was really ashamed of my behavior. I shouldn\u2019t have done\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Gerard. You apologized to my husband then. It\u2019s all in the past.\u201dGerard again bowed at Annette\u2019s words. Annette\u2019s husband, Raphael\u2019s face flashed in front of his dark eyes. Gerard hoped that he would soon realize what a great privilege it was to stand tall next to Annette. Because he was just a butler, he didn\u2019t even get that chance. Gerard suppressed his lingering feelings and closed his eyes. He deliberately said his last farewell in a bright tone.\u201cThe time I served my lady will always be the most precious and warmest memories of my life. Even if I go back to my native country, I will always think of you. Please be happy.\u201dWhen Gerard had finished speaking, he smiled with a cheerful face. Some tears had already accumulated near his eyes. Now not having anything to say to Annette, Gerard turned his back and jumped out of the carriage. Then he strode and disappeared into the darkness.\u201cGerard\u2026.\u201dAnnette sighed as she looked sadly at Gerard\u2019s back from the window. She was worried if he would safely find his way back home. But now it was really time to go back home. Annette, looking out of the dark window, gave orders to start the carriage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The warm white sunlight crept into the room, slowly illuminating the room. Sitting stiffly on a divan, Raphael turned his head. Then he saw Annette\u2019s beautiful face sleeping quietly on the bed. It was a defenseless and lovely face, enough to make people sigh.Raphael, after rising silently from his seat, began to look around her hidden jewelry box. In contrast to his large physique, his movements were quite agile and quiet just like that of wild beasts. After finding what he wanted, Raphael carefully picked up the thing without waking Annette up.The object looked just like what it was in his memory. The ring made of the finest amethyst glinted even in the dim light of early morning. The alphabet \u201cS \u201d engraved with gold leaf on the surface particularly caught his attention. Raphael wasn\u2019t aware of its meaning before, but now he did. It meant that Annette was a client of a special information guild.The Secret Guild.Even Harold Evans, his only acquaintance, also had the ring as he was once in a position to run secret errands for the king. But what about Annette? She was an ordinary woman who enjoyed a peaceful daily life by doing embroidery with her fine hands or reading books. But she was also a woman who secretly hid the token of the Secret Guild deep in her drawer.Raphael looked at the amethyst ring on his palm with an expressionless face. At first glance, one could see that the size of the ring was too big to fit Annette\u2019s fingers. That implied that it wasn\u2019t a ring that was meant to be worn in the first place. Suddenly, Harold\u2019s words flashed in Raphael\u2019s mind.\u201cIt\u2019s a guild that deals with everything except assassination; like exchanging information, sales of various illegal items such as poison, aphrodisiacs, and other weak drugs, kidnapping people, private loan business, etc\u2026. Ah! I heard they\u2019ve recently also ventured into smuggling and also smuggle people outside the kingdom. It\u2019s a pretty expensive service, but if you want to run away from your reality, you won\u2019t be pouring your money down the drain.\u201dRaphael\u2019s hand, grabbing the ring, unknowingly tightened. Yes, Annette might have gone there to just trade information. She wasn\u2019t the type to set foot into illegal crimes. And as for smuggling out of the kingdom\u2026.. he wasn\u2019t sure. Raphael\u2019s face, looking down at the sleeping Annette, showed signs of distress.Yes, nothing was certain yet. It was not reasonable to break Annette\u2019s possessions. Raphael clenched his teeth and placed the ring back in its place. But the moment he closed the drawer, his emotions surged a little. Tak! The sound echoed in the room. Raphael\u2019s keen intuition sensed a disturbance on the bed.\u201cUmm\u2026\u2026Raphael?\u201dSure enough, Annette lifted her eyelids that were heavy with sleep. Her confused pink eyes scanned his face and gave him a worried look. Annette reached out and caressed his cheek carefully. Since he had just woke up, his body temperature, which was higher than usual, felt warm as he came close to her.\u201cDid you have another nightmare? Come here.\u201dAnnette lifted a corner of the quilt and tugged his neck gently. Raphael\u2019s blue eyes looking down at her became a little darker. There was no way he could resist this temptation. He gently lied down beside her as she led him. Then Annette, who stretched out her arms and embraced Raphael\u2019s head, affectionately appeased him.\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Raphael. You\u2019re a good person. I\u2026 I\u2019ll protect you. So relax and sleep well.\u201dIt felt good to hear Annette\u2019s delicate voice, which had become a little husky because of sleep. Her wise and elegant manner of speaking was too cute. It felt like someone was pouring the whole bottle of sweet maple syrup into his ear.Raphael slowly closed his eyes. He liked the feeling of being held in her delicate arms. Annette smelled of clean white musk and some flowers. As she was again breathing steadily, she had fallen asleep before she knew it. Her barely audible and peaceful breath tickled his forehead.\u2018After being so kind to me, you wouldn\u2019t leave me behind, would you?\u2019Raphael tightly clenched his jaw to prevent his face from getting distorted. He slowly raised his torso so that Annette wouldn\u2019t wake up. Then he locked her sleeping figure in his arms. Raphael bowed his head and softly whispered in Annette\u2019s ear.\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere, Annette.\u201dRaphael\u2019s flowing, black hair wrapped around Annette\u2019s small face. Unintentionally, her figure looked like a poor prisoner trapped in a grate. Satisfied with this, Raphael hugged her a little more tightly. Annette groaned in protest as she felt stuffy.Raphael quietly kissed the frown on her forehead. He felt sorry for her, but he didn\u2019t feel like letting go of his arms. If she felt this captivity was too much, then she would have to better get used to it. He didn\u2019t plan to ever let her go.Annette, who woke up in a disarray, checked the clock reflexively. Her body nowadays seemed to be more sluggish than usual, so she had overslept by two hours more. Since she had a lot of things to care about these days, it seemed like she was getting mentally tired.Annette carefully removed Raphael\u2019s arms that were hugging her waist. She was going to let him sleep a little longer. Annette always felt sorry for Raphael because he had suffered long from a sleeping disorder. So, she did not want to disturb his sleep as much as possible.\u2018If I leave, what will he do?\u2019Annette recently had a headache because of this concern. Raphael had now begun to sleep well, but it would become harder for him if she disappeared and his sleeping disorder might also return to its original state. Annette wistfully looked down at Raphael\u2019s sleeping face.His profile, revealed through his disheveled black hair, was just as beautiful as that of an ancient male god. It was amazing to see that his skin didn\u2019t get tanned even though he practiced his swordsmanship skills every day. Annette slowly swept her fingers over Raphael\u2019s straight forehead, high nose, and sensual lips. Then, she got up from the bed.\u201cHah\u2026.\u201dHer troubles were not over yet, but she had to start the new day. Annette stretched out her body and went out of the bedroom in an indoor gown. It was quite late for breakfast, ao she planned to grab a brunch or something. But the plan didn\u2019t go as she wanted. As soon as Annette went out to her private parlor, she ran into a maid, who had an embarrassing look on her face.\u201cMadam, I beg your pardon, but there\u2019s a visitor who has been waiting for you for the past two hours.\u201d\u201cVisitor? What\u2026\u2026 Oh my goodness! I must be out of my mind!!\u201dJust when Annette asked with a perplexed face, she belatedly recalled the promise and was horrified. Today was the day she was scheduled to meet Eucaly and take a brief interview of her. In this life too, Eucaly, Annette\u2019s doctor in her previous life, met her again under a mysterious connection. However, her first impression would turn out to be bad. Seeing Annette rushing to the parlor, the maid was remorseful and bowed her head repeatedly.\u201cI should have woken you up somehow, but since the master was inside\u2026\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t enter like that. I\u2019m really sorry, madam.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. Can you help me with something? Go down and quickly assort her as much as possible.\u201dAnnette waved her hand and offered a realistic alternative. Just as the maid said, she and her husband were spending intimate time together, so the employees were not allowed to interfere recklessly. This was entirely Annette\u2019s fault. She was not a bad hostess who passed on her faults to her employees.The maid\u2019s face brightened a little after receiving Annette\u2019s forgiveness. All the maid had to do was just bow a little and express her gratitude, but instead, she helped Annette get ready as fast as possible. Thanks to her, Annette was able to head downstairs in a decent appearance in just fifteen minutes.When she opened the door to the parlor, she saw Eucaly sitting on the sofa. Her face was exactly how it was in Annette\u2019s memory.Even though Eucaly, who was of mixed descent from the Eastern Continent, had been here for a while, truthfully she was quite an experienced practitioner. However, she had one disadvantage and that was that her features were too modest. Because of her expressionless face, she looked a little gloomy. But no one really cared about one\u2019s appearance or sociability in the profession of a practitioner.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late. Did you wait for a long time?\u201dAnnette politely apologized to Eucaly, who rose from her seat on seeing her. They were not empty words; Annette\u2019s face clearly showed that she was really sorry. Even as a noblewoman, she sincerely apologized to a servant who was not even a noble. After seeing this, Eucaly, who lacked sociability, confidently shook her head to say no.\u201cNo madam. It\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m Eucaly Kayun.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Miss Kayun. I must have forgotten because I had a lot of work yesterday. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201dAnnette almost called Eucaly in a friendly way like in her previous life. Annette smiled sheepishly as she called out Eucaly\u2019s exotic surname. It was a mistake that was unlike Annette\u2019s usual self, who was always thorough with her promises. Annette sat down with a remorseful face. She raised her eyes and looked towards Eucaly.Fortunately, there was tea and cookies placed in front of Eucaly. Seeing the steam rising from the tea even after the two hour wait, the maid must have paid thorough attention. Annette smiled sweetly, inwardly pledging to raise the maid\u2019s salary and asked a question.\u201cSo, Miss Kayun. Do you want to be the family doctor for our family?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Eucaly nodded her head and began to tell about her work experience by taking out some documents from her arms.\u201cI have completed a nine-year medical academy course in the Kingdom of Provatte. Here, I have also brought a recommendation letter from my supervisor and also one from the former president of the Royal Hospital. I\u2019ve specialized in the field of chronic diseases and diseases related to women\u2026.\u201dUnlike her appearance, Eucaly\u2019s tone, which had a Provatte accent, was a little stiff. Perhaps that\u2019s why her self-introduction made Annette feel as if a teacher was giving a lecture to the student. Annette, who already knew about all this, listened while pretending to be interested in Eucaly\u2019s career. She didn\u2019t want to make it obvious that she had gone back in time and knew everything here. Thanks to this, Eucaly finished her self-introduction without any problems.\u201cI heard it well. You\u2019ve had an impressive career experience, Miss Kayun. I think you\u2019re as competent as I\u2019ve heard.\u201dAnnette smiled as she presented the letter of introduction she received from her former practitioner. That gentleman was a timid person, who was particularly afraid of Raphael. So he introduced Eucaly instead and ran away so that he would never be called to the Carnesis Mansion again. \u201cMadam you must hire Eucaly!\u201d Annette smiled as she recalled the desperate appeal of the practitioner to hire Eucaly.\u201cWell, madam. Then, whether I\u2019m hired or not\u2026.\u201dSeeing Annette become silent for a moment, Eucaly\u2019s expression became a little darker. She was worried that she might have given Annette a bad impression. Annette liked Eucaly\u2019s such clumsy appearance. She was older than herself, but somehow her naive and clumsy actions made Annette want to take care of her.\u2018You took good care of me in my past life.\u2019Annette in her previous life was very sensitive because of her long illness. Having a weak body was scary. Even healthy people become crazy if they have to lie down on a hospital bed every day. Annette cried, vomited, and desperately clung to Eucaly whenever she was seriously ill. Now that she thought about it, she felt sorry towards her.Annette was so lonely in her previous life. She was abandoned by her father and her brother, Arjen and her sister-in-law, Claire were in an empire too far away. On top of that, she also had a bad relationship with her husband, Raphael. So, the only person on whom she could rely was Eucaly. Perhaps it was quite a burdensome situation for Eucaly as her doctor.Nevertheless, Eucaly patiently took good care of her. Because of that, Annette\u2019s condition also somewhat stabilized. She was also able to reconcile with Raphael, who came to check on her condition.\u2018That\u2019s when he started nursing me.\u2019At first, Raphael went outside leaving her completely to Eucaly\u2019s care. It was expected since their relationship was so bad.But one day, when Annette was on the brink of death, Raphael, who had come to check Annette\u2019s condition for the first time in a while, looked very shocked. He had thought she was doing fine as usual with her treatment, but Annette\u2019s condition was far worse than he thought.After that Raphael always stayed by her side. Later, he took care of Annette\u2019s every need on behalf of Eucaly and managed her medication and treatment. Even though he always fought with her, he seemed to be bothered by her death. Thanks to him, she wasn\u2019t able to bother Eucaly till the time of her death.\u2018Raphael looks violent, but he\u2019s actually sweet.\u2019Annette laughed as she recalled Raphael\u2019s sleeping figure lying on her bed like a lazy lion. In order not to waste her second life as before, Annette\u2019s priority now was to take care of her health. To do so, she was trying to sleep more than before and take as little stress as possible. This was why she had hired a doctor to carefully take care of her health.Annette, who had made up her mind, smiled warmly at Eucaly.\u201cWelcome to the Carnesis family, Miss Kayun.\u201dAt those words, Eucaly, who hadn\u2019t met Annette\u2019s eyes until now, raised her head for the first time. The dark expression on her face had now slightly brightened. As she stood stupefied in a place, Eucaly took a deep breath, and then bowed her head to Annette.\u201cThank you, madam. Please call me Eucaly.\u201d\u201cAll right, Miss Eucaly. I look forward to your kind cooperation.\u201dAnnette smiled at the look on Eucaly\u2019s face, which looked much better than before. She was in desperate need of a job because she was far away from her hometown and didn\u2019t have a place to stay. Now that she was hired as a physician of an aristocratic family, no wonder she was so relieved.Annette was going to leave after clearing herself of her false charges. However, even after that, Eucaly would still be able to work here. Aristocratic families seldom kicked out a doctor who was hired by them once. In addition, because of Raphael\u2019s personality and excellent health, he wouldn\u2019t even remember that he had a doctor in his mansion. Annette was pleased to be able to help Eucaly like this. She owed a lot to her in her past life.\u2018But in this life, I\u2019ll try to be less indebted to Eucaly.\u2019Not only with Eucaly, but she also wanted to do the same with Raphael. There\u2019s no way he would take care of her in this life, but again, she couldn\u2019t say for sure. In her previous life, she was really amazed to see him nurse her from her illness even though he had a terrible temper.Of course, Raphael\u2019s care didn\u2019t always go smoothly. There was too much of a rift between the couple to do that. While nursing, Raphael often got angry at Annette\u2019s nervous responses and ran out of the room in a fit of rage. But he always returned to Annette within half a day.Then he boiled the soup he had thrown away and scooped it to feed her. He also changed the sheets and helped Annette up, as her condition didn\u2019t even allow her to get up. At the last moment of her death, he even\u2026.\u2018Did he cry for me? I don\u2019t remember very well.\u2019Annette remembered the moment when death loomed over her body. At first, her vision flashed and became dark and then her hearing ceased. She was very scared and started panicking. She tried to move her hands, but her arms and legs had already been paralyzed. And a cold numbness, that one felt when their skin was pressed against ice for a long time, slowly overtook her whole body. That was the feeling of death that Annette remembered.Her sight was the first thing that disappeared, so Annette couldn\u2019t see Raphael\u2019s face at that time. However, she remembered seeing his contorting face in her blurred vision as if he was going to cry. She didn\u2019t want to make Raphael look like that again. For that, it was evident what she had to do.\u201cThen Miss Eucaly, would you like to have a meal together to celebrate your appointment as our family doctor?\u201dAnnette, who had woken up late, couldn\u2019t eat anything. So she smiled while hiding her growling stomach. Her tone asking her employee was unbelievably sweet. Of course, Eucaly agreed.* * *The long-awaited day had finally come. The fall harvest festival hosted by the temple of Odessa Louis had begun. In words, it was just a ritual, but actually, it was celebrated like a festival in the temple. On this day, everyone, regardless of age or gender, visited the temple to relish the delicious sheep\u2019s milk cheese, and wine.Thanks to this, all of the nobles living near the capital of Deltium, the bourgeoisie, and the commoners, all headed for the Odessa Louis\u2019 temple. Even Celestine Keers, who will soon become the Crown Princess, would also attend. Annette was also going to do the same, but her way of visiting the temple was a little different.\u201cLet\u2019s see, the Western Tomb is probably around here\u2026\u2026.\u201dAnnette headed to the cemetery of the temple of Odessa Louis, referring to the map that Railin had sent in advance. She had to climb a mountain a bit to avoid other people\u2019s eyes, but it was fine as she had safely reached without getting sick or sore anywhere. Thanks to this, she was able to enter the cemetery without being seen by anyone.She was glad it was festival time now. Originally, no one paid attention to the cemetery on a festive day. People were instinctively reluctant to visit a cemetery on a joyous day, for fear of attracting bad luck. Thanks to this, Annette was able to look around the cemetery where even a single ant couldn\u2019t be seen.The place she had promised to meet with Railin was the western tomb, but it was not easy to find the way because the cemetery was very large. Annette, who was struggling to find the way, raised her ears. She could hear the loud voices coming from the distant temple. Everyone seemed drunk after drinking a lot of wine, that was made in the temple. No one would notice Annette in such a busy atmosphere.\u2018As expected, Sir Railin is so amazing. I think we\u2019ll successfully infiltrate the temple today.\u2019Annette was a little relieved. She was very nervous ahead of the big event. Since her return, Annette had continuously faced huge challenges that she could not even imagine before. Annette felt both unfamiliar and amazed at herself. She never thought people could change 180 degrees for their survival.Fortunately, Annette was soon able to find the Western Tomb, the place of her appointment. At first, she thought things had gone wrong because she went to the wrong tomb in the east. She was scared when she saw no presence of either Railin or the new priest\u2019s clothes that he was supposed to prepare. It was fortunate that the priests had kindly embossed \u201cEast\u201d on the floor of the cemetery.\u2018Those who are closest to God, how considerate of you.\u2019Annette was deeply impressed. Although she first attended this temple for Celestine, she wasn\u2019t exactly a believer, but she decided to believe in the goddess Odessa. Anyway, after finding the right path, Annette looked around and entered the western part of the cemetery carefully.\u201c\u2026\u2026Is this the right place?\u201dAs she opened the heavy stone door and entered, she could see the \u201cWest\u201d mark embossed on the floor.\u2018I think I\u2019ve come to the right place.\u2019A light breeze from the dusty cemetery brushed against the tip of her nose. Even in broad daylight, the room was quite dark with grey tones all over it, giving off a gloomy atmosphere. The only sound one could hear inside the building built for the dead was the sound of Annette\u2019s footsteps.Annette looked around, but couldn\u2019t find Railin. Instead, the statue standing in the center of the tomb seemed to stare down at her. Maybe because it was dark and she couldn\u2019t see its face well, the statue felt even more dismal.Knowing that she was doing \u2018bad things\u2019, Annette trembled unknowingly. She closed her eyes and clasped her hands in a prayer before the statue.\u2018I\u2019m sorry, goddess Odessa. I\u2019ll leave right away after meeting Celestine Keers.\u2019Just at that moment, the statue standing in front of Annette\u2019s eyes suddenly reached out and grabbed her shoulder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The statue inside the tomb was moving, as if the angry Goddess were about to smite her for her intrusion. Annette crouched on the floor with a scream, her eyes white with fear.Step by step, the statue approached and leaned over her, and she felt an unearthly horror as the shadow of death loomed over her head. Terrified, Annette looked up at it with tear-filled eyes.The statue laughed.\u201cSorry! Sorry, dear customer, it seems I got a little carried away.\u201dIf that husky voice had been a color, it would have been a sparkling red ruby. It was impossible for her not to recognize it. Annette stared at the statue, bewildered.\u201cRa, Railin?\u201dAt first, she couldn\u2019t tell because it was so dark, but now she could clearly make out his face. Annette sincerely wondered what on earth he was thinking in that twisted mind. Who the hell would expect to find another person in such a ghastly place, disguised as one of the cemetery statues. The lunatic. Railin grinned. His face was covered with bronze paint.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you\u2019d be so surprised.\u201d\u201cOf course I was. You almost gave me a heart attack.\u201dAs her shock faded, anger filled the void. Annette had never been so frightened in her life, and though she tried to gather herself with haughty dignity, she hardly looked threatening with tears still streaming from her cheeks. Railin\u2019s smile widened.She\u2019s so adorable\u2026The woman Railin knew was always serene, with the dignity of a noblewoman. Impeccable elegance. An enigmatic smile. That was the face Annette showed the outside world, and despite his particular tastes, Railin had enjoyed that mask very much.Her tearful face was even more exhilarating, because it revealed her real emotions. He couldn\u2019t help but smile at this glimpse of her true nature, even if it made him a sadist.Chivalrous now, Railin held out his hand.\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time. You must get up.\u201dAnnette took his hand, rising. Wiping the tears from her cheeks, she was quick to regain her usual serenity, but there was still an edge of anger in her voice.\u201cDon\u2019t do that again, Railin. I\u2019m a little anxious. If that happened again, you might find yourself with a corpse to conceal.\u201d\u201cThat would be a hassle. I have never enjoyed such labors.\u201dAnnette disliked his bright smile. If he had shorter legs or fat belly, maybe she would\u2019ve noticed something off about the statue, but Railin was so naturally statuesque she had never noticed the deception, even though all he had done was paint his skin. In the dark, he blended into the cemetery too well.\u201cEnough of your jokes,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you bring the clothes you promised?\u201d\u201cOf course. Here.\u201dRailin opened the lid of one of the sarcophagi in a nearby crypt, pulling out the uniform of an Odessa priestess, and a ceremonial mask. The intricate embroidery on the uniform made it difficult to counterfeit. Annette took these items, wondering how he had acquired them so quickly. Then her expression shifted to one of distaste.\u201cOh, I\u2019ve kept them in the sarcophagus, so they will smell strange,\u201d Railin explained. \u201cPlease understand.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. It\u2019s okay,\u201d Annette replied reluctantly.The uniform looked clean, but the fabric wafted a peculiar musty smell. But now was not the time to complain. Stepping into a separate chamber of the crypt, she changed her clothes and came back out.\u201cHow do I look?\u201dWith the hood on her head, Annette had to tilt her head back. In the white uniform, her elegant face shone like a star in the darkness. Railin smiled in satisfaction. Even without a mask, she looked more holy than any of the priestesses ever could.\u201cIs the alibi prepared as well?\u201d She asked anxiously, clutching the mask in her hand. She had asked him to prepare an excuse for her escape, in case something went wrong, and of course Railin had prepared it in advance. He smiled, approving of her caution. Annette was checking every last detail.\u201cOf course. No one will expect our client to be in that place at that time. Everything is prepared perfectly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. You\u2019ve done an excellent work.\u201d\u201cMy work is the best in Deltium, isn\u2019t it? Now then, shall we get going?\u201cYes. I\u2019m ready.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nervously, Annette pulled on the ceremonial mask, completing her disguise. Railin led the way out of the crypt, and Annette watched his back as she walked slowly behind him.\u201cDo you think it wise for you to go out looking like that?\u201d she asked. His body was painted with bronze pigment, and he was wearing a dark chiton like an ancient god. His ominous appearance was jarring in the sunny afternoon.Hesitantly, Annette followed him, keeping a little distance between them. She feared discovery because of his odd appearance. But as they approached the temple, this fear vanished.\u201cWho are all these people?\u201d She asked, looking at all the others. \u201cWhy do they look like that?\u201dThe temple grounds were crowded with people, and several of the men were dressed the same as Railin. In fact, there were some people whose costumes were even more bizarre. There were men with goat horns on their heads like ancient demons, and others with a painted black mask around their eyes. There were women wearing wings made of white chicken feathers. Compared to them, Railin looked almost normal. He bowed his head.\u201cOh, no wonder you were so surprised. It\u2019s your first time attending the autumn ceremony, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ve never frequented the temple,\u201d Annette confessed frankly. The Kingdom of Deltium was not religiously pious. Of course, the existence of God was acknowledged, and priests were respected, but when it came to individual belief, the situation was a little different.Religious freedom was allowed in Deltium. But religion itself was discouraged, for fear that over-reliance on a religion would undermine royal authority. Those who believed participated in religious customs, and those who did not believe were permitted their disinterest. Annette\u2019s father was a noted unbeliever.Only weak men need a God.Annette remembered the cold precision of Allamand\u2019s lips, the contempt in his voice. She had had no choice but to abide by his word, like an obedient daughter. She had felt more like his property than a person.Remembering this, her expression was grim, and as soon as Railin saw it, he wanted to distract her. He caught her hand.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dAnnette lifted her head to look up at him. She had already told him not to recklessly touch her body, and he had done it again. But just as she was about to scold him, Railin slipped a thin silver bracelet on her wrist.\u201cThis bracelet will aid your deception,\u201d he said. \u201cIn your mind, think the word, shine.\u201dHis eyes arced like a crescent moon, and Annette looked at the bracelet on her wrist, puzzled. Reflexively, she thought shine, and to her surprise a subtle glow, like that of a firefly, came to rest in her palm. The bracelet seemed to be manifesting some power.\u201cGive it back after you\u2019re done with it, it\u2019s valuable,\u201d said Railin. \u201cUsually we don\u2019t lend it out, but you\u2019re a special customer.\u201d\u201cThank you, it\u2019s a very interesting bracelet. I\u2019ll take good care of it,\u201d Annette promised, nodding. Her hand covered the bracelet protectively, fearing she would lose it. Suddenly, Railin seemed like a sorcerer, giving out mysterious magical objects. But that was a ridiculous idea. The ancient magic had all but disappeared.As soon as she was wearing the bracelet, the people gathered in front of the temple began to approach her. They had been watching her earlier, and Annette had been nervous, wondering if she looked somehow suspicious. But then an older man who looked a little like her father bowed politely.\u201cPlease, grant me the grace of the Holy Goddess, o faithful servant of the Goddess.\u201dAt that moment, she realized how she was meant to use the bracelet. Annette cleared her throat and lowered her voice to disguise it.\u201cThe breath of the Goddess will always be with thee, devoted lamb of the Goddess,\u201d she said, solemn as any priest. Laying her hand on the man\u2019s head, she thought, shine. Fortunately, the light glowed in her hand, just as before, and all the people nearby exclaimed with amazement.Once she had finished the blessing, she looked around, examining the people nearby. It was easier to quietly observe when she was wearing a mask, and no one seemed to suspect her after such an excellent performance.Maybe too excellent.\u201cBless me, too!\u201d\u201cNo, I am next, get out of the way!\u201d\u201cPlease make a line!\u201dIn an instant, a long line formed before her, and she watched it in quiet panic. Did she really have to bless every single one? She would be trapped in this place until the sun went down. And she was very worried that the other priests might discover her, with all this commotion she was causing.In short, she was in trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Somehow, she thought he would help her out of this predicament, but he had disappeared. Her heart fluttered with anxiety, and suddenly, someone grabbed her arm.\u201cThere you are! We\u2019ve been looking all over for you. The ceremony is about to begin, and you\u2019re still here?\u201dWho is this?Annette\u2019s pupils trembled. A woman in a priestess\u2019s robes like hers was pretending to know her. At first, she thought it might have been Railin again, but the voice was unmistakably a woman\u2019s. Annette wondered if she might have mistaken Annette for another priestess.I can\u2019t talk, she\u2019ll find me out if she hears my voice.Bowing apologetically, Annette followed her. At least she was able to escape from the crowd with the priestess\u2019s help. And she seemed to be quite a high rank in the Odessa temple; people were clearing a path on both sides wherever she went.Annette\u2019s heart was pounding with fear that the priestess would speak to her. It seemed so loud, she wondered if she could hear her heartbeat. But luckily the priestess asked no questions as they entered the temple. There were many people inside, but even so, it seemed only select believers were permitted to enter. Turning a corner, they came to a more secluded area, and the priestess finally released Annette\u2019s arm.What should I do now?Annette fidgeted anxiously. She had come this far under the pretense of the ceremony, but Annette was not a priestess. She knew nothing of these religious rites. And if her identity was revealed under these circumstances, her life would be over. Nervously, she watched as the priestess lifted a hand.For a moment, she panicked, thinking the other woman might strike her.But the priestess was only lifting her hand to show the ring she was wearing. For a moment, Annette was confused, until she recognized the symbol on the ring.\u201cYou\u2026!\u201dAnnette also had a ring engraved with the letter S. Apparently the priestess before her also belonged to the Guild of Secrets.\u201cShh,\u201d the priestess said cautiously. \u201cYour request was for our aid in infiltrating the temple, and we have completed that task. What happens now is entirely in madam\u2019s hands. I hope you will take care of yourself.\u201dHer voice was politely clerical. Annette wondered if she was a priestess with a side job, or a member of the Guild of Secrets who was just pretending to be a priestess. But either way, the woman left before Annette had time to ask any questions.Alone, Annette looked around cautiously. Peeking around the corner of the corridor, she saw a sign in the distance that said Second Chapel. She pulled a map from her pocket of the Odessa temple, reviewing the path again.Turn right here, and then down two corridors\u2026the third room from the left.According to the information Railin had provided, Celestine Keers was a devout believer.When she visited the temple, she would meet alone with a priest named Louis to confide all her fears. He had guided her since childhood. The temple was a place used as a confessional for members of the aristocracy, and they were treated with as much deference as the royal family.The future Crown Princess is a devotee of this temple. Surely, the Odessa temple must treat Celestine well.She hoped the temple would receive considerable preference in return, if Celestine became Queen.But Annette wasn\u2019t interested in that. There was only one thing she wanted to know.Had Celestine been the one to ruin her life by faking her own kidnapping?Cautiously, Annette walked through the halls, occasionally glancing at her map. Finally, she arrived at her destination.But the moment she found the third room on the left, her eyes grew wide as saucers.The hall of confession rooms was blocked off.By Celestine\u2019s guards.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There seemed to be about a dozen of them at a glance, and the moment they spotted her uniform, their hostility dissipated a bit. A middle-aged man who seemed to be in charge spoke.\u201cYou\u2019re a priestess in service of the Goddess Odessa, what brings you here?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, I am meant to meet a believer here\u2026isn\u2019t this area used for confessions?\u201dAnnette\u2019s voice through the mask was faint as a canary\u2019s. The slimness of her body was obvious even under the robes of a priestess, so it was clear she was no threat; there was no question that she could easily be subdued by force, if necessary. But they did not let their guard down.\u201cThis area is always forbidden at times like this,\u201d he said, smiling; \u201cI can tell you participated in the ceremony by that mask. But you don\u2019t know anything about it?\u201dThe entire confessional area must have been blocked off during Celestine\u2019s visit, for her safety. Fortunately the mask concealed Annette\u2019s embarrassment, but now she could not retreat.\u201cOh,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cI am too early, I see. I was overzealous in my concern for the hearts of believers. I apologize for interfering with your orders.\u201dShe bowed her head, turning to leave, but the man approached her first. He was looking at her mask as if he was about to ask her to remove it, and she thought quickly. In her mind, she said shine once again, to use the power of her bracelet.\u201cI just realized, it\u2019s the fall festival, and I haven\u2019t yet blessed any of the Goddess\u2019s devoted lambs. Would you like to bow your head?\u201dThe sight of her glowing hand made the guards relent a little; not just anyone had that power, and it was proof that she really was a high-ranking priestess. There was no need to ask her to remove her mask.\u201cThank you, but it will have to be another time,\u201d the guard said. \u201cI am on duty now, as you can see. As you are early, please leave and come back later.\u201dHe crossed his arms when he had finished, and was clearly determined not to let her out of his sight until she vanished back down the corridor. But she had no intention of giving up so easily. She had already risked a lot to come this far, and Celestine had been avoiding public activities. This was her only chance to catch her alone.\u201cOh, wait a moment. If not a blessing, please at least hear the hymn of the Goddess. It is the autumn festival, after all.\u201dShe began to sing before he had time to refuse. Her voice quivered a little with nerves, to be trying to put so many people to sleep at once for the first time, but it was a good place to make the attempt. Her voice echoed down the narrow corridors.Gradually, the guards slumped to the floor, their eyes closed. Once she had finished her song, she gently nudged one fallen body with her foot. The guard grunted, but slept on.Quickly, she stepped over the bodies into the confessional. When she forced a person from a normal state into sleep, the effect only lasted about five minutes. There wasn\u2019t much time.Celestine must be here.The third confessional was magnificently decorated down to its golden doorknob, shaped like an eagle and reserved for special guests, most often aristocrats. Annette pulled the door open to find two women sleeping at the long wooden table in the center of the room. She had worried that people inside the room wouldn\u2019t be able to hear her song, but apparently it was not soundproof.She easily recognized Celestine Keers\u2019s dark brown hair, and she guessed the other person opposite her was the priestess named Louise. Annette dragged both chair and priestess over to a corner, grateful that the priestess was thin. Though she had used her powers, Annette wasn\u2019t sure whether the priestess would wake up if there was a loud noise.Then she reached out to shake Celestine\u2019s shoulder.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dCelestine\u2019s eyes fluttered open, her green eyes revealed beneath brown eyelashes. Annette smiled with satisfaction. Finally, they could have a real conversation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Priestess Louise?\u201dClutching her temples, Celestine didn\u2019t immediately understand what had happened. It seemed she had mistaken Annette for Louise, dressed as they were in the same robes. Calmly, Annette removed her mask, suppressing a tremor in her hand.Celestine\u2019s eyes widened. Annette felt immense satisfaction at seeing the shock in her face, as if she had forgotten how to breathe. Smiling, she sat down across from Celestine.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Celestine. Or should I call you Your Highness\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? What are you doing to me again?!\u201dInstantly. Annette was appalled. She had never done anything to Celestine, and had suspected that Celestine had planned the kidnapping herself, to get Annette out of her way. Wasn\u2019t Celestine avoiding her because she felt guilty, or was afraid of Annette openly accusing her?But Celestine made a convincing victim, recoiling in fright so hard she nearly fell out of her chair, her whole body trembling. All Annette needed was for the future Crown Princess to fall and break her neck. Quickly, she grabbed her arm.\u201cCalm down, you\u2019ll hurt yourself.\u201dBut as soon as her hand touched her, Celestine shook her off hysterically and fell off the chair onto her backside rather than on her head. Rapidly, she crawled away, as if she hadn\u2019t even noticed the hurt.\u201cDon\u2019t touch me! Get away from me! What do you want, haven\u2019t you already done enough? Help me! Is anyone there? Help!\u201dShe screamed so loudly that Annette rushed over to cover her mouth, her heart racing at Celestine\u2019s disgusting exaggeration. Frozen, she turned to listen to see if anyone was coming. It didn\u2019t seem the guards outside the room had awakened.\u201cHmmmm!!!\u201d Celestine struggled against Annette\u2019s hand. The two women were of similar size, so it was not easy for Annette to subdue her. Conversation was impossible while she was panicking like this, anyway.\u201cShhh,\u201d Annette said, trying to calm her. Her voice was soft. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything to you. I just wanted five minutes to talk to you alone. I\u2019ll leave as soon as I ask you a few questions, I promise.\u201d\u201cHmm!!! Hm!!!\u201dCelestine did not believe her. Well, who would take the word of someone who had infiltrated a Temple in disguise, and somehow managed to put everyone nearby to sleep? Celestine would have to be an idiot to not be suspicious.Annette jerked back as the frightened woman bit her hand so hard, it hurt even through her gloves. Annette was confused. She had never expected Celestine to react this way.\u201cListen to me, Lady Keers,\u201d she said, thinking quickly. \u201cI swear in the name of Odessa that I will not harm you. I\u2019m a believer, just like you.\u201dAgain, she thought, shine with all her might, bringing the bright light to her hand. The bracelet had certainly come in useful today. As she saw the divine glow, Celestine stopped struggling. She really was a devout believer. Hesitantly, she removed her teeth from Annette\u2019s hand.\u201cThank you. I\u2019m going to let go of you now,\u201d Annette said. \u201cI will never hurt you, so please don\u2019t scream. Like I said, I will leave as soon as I\u2019ve asked a few questions.\u201dCelestine nodded a little, though she was still trembling. Slowly, Annette removed her hand, prepared to clap it over her mouth again if Celestine tried to scream. A piece of her glove came loose, bitten through, but Annette didn\u2019t bother to retrieve it. She had been cautious enough to wear cheap gloves, easily acquired, which no one could trace if they were found.For a moment, Annette eyed the other woman. She didn\u2019t scream, but her face was pale, and her teeth were clenched. Her fear looked utterly genuine.Annette was very confused.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I had thought you bribed my coachman to fake it yourself, but now\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Celestine burst out, cutting her off mid-sentence. Her face was red. \u201cYou think I set that up?\u201dUntil that moment, she had been trembling with fear, but now it was clear that she was shaking with anger.\u201cSince that day\u2026do you know what it has been like for me? My heart races every time I hear a strange man\u2019s voice! Even when I am home, I can\u2019t stop checking behind the furniture, to make sure no one is hiding there! And when I try to go outside\u2026\u201dThe words burst out between gasps, her mouth twisting to try to fight them back, her lipstick smearing over her teeth. She didn\u2019t even notice. Even as she was crying, she glared at Annette.\u201cYou have your wonderful marriage, but I\u2019m still scared to death, every day, it\u2019s so hard, and I can\u2019t even talk about it to anyone, and now you chase me here when I\u2019m praying to the Goddess for help\u2026!\u201dOvercome, she burst into sobs as her emotions overflowed. Annette was almost dizzy with shock as she watched the other woman weeping, clutching at her heart, in every way appearing sincerely distressed.It was possible that Celestine had convinced herself of her own lies, but Annette couldn\u2019t quite believe it. The storm of emotions looked so genuine, consistent with her story.Something was wrong. Quickly, Annette reviewed her own assumptions. She had believed Celestine was trying to avoid her from guilt, for having set Annette up for a crime she had not committed, and stealing the place of Crown Princess. But really, her behavior could easily be explained as lingering trauma from being kidnapped.It was the last thing Annette had expected. She had been so sure of Celestine\u2019s guilt.But it also made sense, then, that Celestine would avoid engaging in social activities, even though she would soon become Crown Princess. It was understandable that she would seek refuge in religion. All of it could be explained by trauma.Annette was so confused, she felt as if she were going out of her mind. Now there were two possibilities: either Celestine was completely innocent, or she was a brazen liar. But there was no evidence for either. It would be foolish to try to make a judgment now.She needed more time to think.And that time could not be now. Annette saw the priestess, sleeping in her chair, starting to twitch. Celestine\u2019s screaming was going to wake her up any minute, and the guards outside were likely in a similar condition.Nervously, Annette glanced that way. She was certain there was noise outside the door.Glancing down at the sobbing Celestine, Annette knelt down beside her on the floor, and Celestine lifted her tear-streaked face in surprise. The two women\u2019s eyes met.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Celestine,\u201d Annette whispered sincerely. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were suffering like that. I thought it was all a plan of yours, because I\u2019m innocent, too. I swear in the name of the Goddess that I had nothing to do with your kidnapping. If I had, it would have been silly to risk coming in here like this to see you, don\u2019t you think?\u201dShe sighed.She had done the best she could, but she doubted she had conveyed it very well to Celestine. The other lady was looking at Annette with wet eyes, panting. It was clear in her face that she was still wondering whether to believe Annette.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Carefully, she took her hand.\u201cAnyway, I am sorry that you have suffered because of me,\u201d she murmured, smiling gently before Celestine could shake her hand loose. \u201cEven if it was a misunderstanding, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had such a hard time. I hope you can overcome it soon. You are a strong person. I know you can do it.\u201dCelestine\u2019s eyes trembled at the sincere words. The hand holding hers still bore the marks of her teeth, and must have been quite painful, but Annette showed no sign of it. She rose, patting the back of her hand.\u201cI\u2019ll disappear now, just as I promised. Celestine\u2026this is just a nightmare you\u2019ve had for a little bit. So forget about today, all right?\u201dAnnette whispered it, as if she were dropping a hint, and Celestine looked puzzled. But before she could say anything, Annette quickly began to sing again, so clear that it would be audible even outside the door.Her power worked almost immediately. Before she had finished the first phrase, Celestine\u2019s body had sagged to the floor, and once she was sure she was completely asleep, Annette sang for another full minute, carefully checking everyone else.Good. They\u2019re all sleeping.She could hear the snoring of the priestess, who had been twitching earlier as if she were about to awaken. The guards also seemed to be asleep, as the corridor outside was quiet again.Having regained some composure, Annette dragged the sleeping Celestine back into her chair. It was quite difficult, as they were about the same size, but she managed it. Swiping the sticky sweat from her forehead with her sleeve, Annette pulled out a clean handkerchief to carefully wipe the tears from Celestine\u2019s face. That face had been twisted with torment, but now it smoothed out in her sleep.In silence, Annette walked out the door to find the guards asleep on the floor. Judging by their position, it seemed like she had put them back to sleep just in time.I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t wake up.Annette walked cautiously between their bodies. Before turning the corner of the corridor, she reached into her pocket, pulling out a bottle filled with a soporific fragrance.When these guards woke up, the first thing they would do is check on Celestine, to make sure she was safe. The next thing would be to try to understand why they had all fallen asleep at once. They would remember talking to a priestess, and then nothing.That was why she had prepared an excuse for them.I can\u2019t let them find out about my power.Annette didn\u2019t want to reveal that she was a regressor, or that it had granted her special powers. Her skill was useful, but it certainly had limitations.What if she tried to begin singing, and someone simply rushed over and covered her mouth? Her targets didn\u2019t even have to do that, all they had to do was cover their own ears. Her power could only be effective if the other person wasn\u2019t expecting it.It would be foolish to reveal the skill she had obtained after so much suffering, only for it to become useless once it was widely known.Annette had decided to stage some crime scenes.If they find this bottle on the floor, smelling of a soporific drug\u2026Annette left the temple with the empty bottle in the corridor of the confessional, and as the sun was setting, the temple\u2019s autumn ritual was in full swing. The priests had made wine and all the faithful were intoxicated in more ways than one.She was able to easily pass through them to reach the lonely cemetery, and enter the crypt where she had met Railin. There, a fresh set of clothing was waiting for her, and after she had changed, she wrapped the priestess\u2019s garb and mask in a cloth. Once these were burned, it would be the perfect crime.Now she had only to return home, where Raphael was waiting for her. She had arranged a carriage beforehand, and after she left the cemetery, she mentally moved on to the next set of steps. She had achieved her purpose in meeting Celestine. Annette was relieved to have accomplished it.I never thought I could be so bold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Whether she liked it or not, there was no doubt she was a cold-blooded Bavaria. She had grown up as Allamand\u2019s daughter, and had learned to think meticulously.Celestine\u2019s guards had never seen her face beneath the mask. They could suspect the culprit was the priestess they had met before falling asleep, but it would be difficult to discover her identity, especially on a festival day. The temple of Odessa was very large, and there were many masked priestesses present for the ritual.They would never find Annette. She was not a priestess at all.But things could become very complicated if Celestine mentioned her.At worst, Celestine could only say that Annette had intruded in her confessional. But Annette had already considered this case, as well. No one but Celestine had seen her face. An investigation would be conducted if she made the accusation, but Annette had already prepared a perfect alibi, through Railin.Really\u2026 I am a Bavaria.She smiled reluctantly. The clothes Railin had left for her were the perfect alibi, but if Raphael knew of her plans, he would have been disgusted. He hated the deceits of the Bavaria family.Lost in thought, she suddenly remembered Raphael\u2019s eyes, blue as a winter sea beneath his sharp, hawk-like eyebrows. Every time he turned that cold look on her, she felt such pain, as sharp as a stab to her heart. He had said he hated her. He hated the entire Bavaria family.Silently, she closed her eyes, her head resting against the side of her carriage.She wanted to leave for Osland as soon as possible.She wanted to see the place where she would live with her own eyes. There was no other choice, when her relationship with her husband was a lost cause.The trip back to the house of the man who hated her was desolate.But once she arrived, and searched the second floor, she discovered that Raphael was nowhere to be found. Cocking her head quizzically, she caught a passing maid.\u201cHave you seen his lordship?\u201d\u201cThe master went to the palace, and has not yet returned,\u201d the maid replied politely.Annette nodded and went upstairs. She had known that Raphael had been summoned to the palace, which had allowed her to infiltrate the temple without having to make excuses to him. But she hadn\u2019t expected him to be so long in returning.She would have liked to know what King Selgratis had to say to him. It was good that he cared for his illegitimate son; having the favor of the king meant power, and even the nobility of Deltium could not afford to ignore Raphael. But Annette had always thought that the king had a strange way of expressing his affection for his sons.I wish he would not compare His Highness Ludwig to Raphael.Annette still remembered Ludwig\u2019s miserable face, grieving at being compared to his half-brother Raphael. Ludwig had always been sensitive about his poor physical fitness, and King Selgratis was obviously disgusted by his weakness. In Ludwig\u2019s presence, the king had proudly said, Raphael should have been my legitimate son.That sort of thing had given Ludwig very complicated feelings about Raphael.And now that his fianc\u00e9e had married Raphael\u2026it was only to be expected that his resentment would grow worse. Annette no longer had feelings for Ludwig, but she vividly remembered her last sight of him, his face distorted by tears. He obviously hated Raphael.But what does Raphael think of Ludwig, and His Majesty the King?Suddenly, Annette was curious about Raphael\u2019s opinion of the matter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could clearly see the wrinkles around his eyes beneath gray eyebrows, but those eyes were the same blue as his own. Raphael couldn\u2019t help wondering if this was what he would look like in thirty years.\u201c\u2026I believe in you, Raphael. You have what it takes to lead our kingdom into the future. It seems like only yesterday that you were a child, but you have grown into a great man. I have never regretted my decision to take you in, my son.\u201dIn case I should forget all the favors you have given me, Raphael thought cynically. Superficially, it might have seemed like a genuine compliment, but it was just another way for Selgratis to remind him of the debt he owed. The loyalty that Raphael owed to the kingdom, which had given him such a privileged upbringing despite his illegitimate birth.Every time he heard words like this, the frustration made his stomach churn. Selgratis had at least two or three other illegitimate children; probably more. But most of them would never have a noble title. They would live hidden in shadows, given a pittance to survive.If Raphael had not showed so much promise with the sword so young, he would have met the same fate.If I were not useful, he would have abandoned me, too.Thinking of the squalor of his childhood, Raphael knew that Selgratis had done him no favors. He had merely seen Raphael\u2019s talent and made an investment.And after everything he had done to suppress the Letan rebellion, Raphael considered that debt paid. He didn\u2019t like the King acting as if a favor was still owed when Raphael hadn\u2019t slept through a single night since the bloody end of the war.He was grateful to his father. After he had ascertained the extent of Raphael\u2019s talent, he had been unstinting in his support. When he invested, he invested seriously. Selgratis had raised Raphael high enough that he could deal decisively with the other nobles, who despised him for his birth.And Raphael was especially grateful for his marriage to Annette. Not just a legitimate daughter, but the daughter of Bavaria, the noblest lineage in Deltium aside from the royal family, a woman who might have been Queen. Without his father\u2019s support, Raphael could never have married someone like her.That is something to be thankful for.He couldn\u2019t help picturing her beautiful face. In the beginning, he would sooner have died than marry her. What fools people could be. But Raphael would still have argued that he had good reasons for his resistance. Duke Bavaria had objected louder than anyone else when Raphael was given his title. He had never missed an opportunity to insult him, and even after Raphael became a Marquis, he continued to ignore both him and his title. At social events they both attended, he would immediately rise from his seat when Raphael appeared, saying he would not sit with an illegitimate nobleman.Of course, Raphael had been so enraged at these humiliations, his vision went red.And then suddenly he was to marry that man\u2019s daughter!He had been sure she would be just like her father, and it would be hell to live under the same roof. But Selgratis had admonished him to go through with the marriage.\u201cYou stubborn fool!\u201d The King had exclaimed. \u201cA Marquis title is not enough. You must take this path for your family to prosper. Would you really refuse such an excellent match because of your stupid pride?!\u201dThough Selgratis did not know Raphael well, he had been very generous. He wasn\u2019t sure if the King was just feigning his concern, but the aristocrats of Deltium at least believed that his favor for Raphael was genuine.The marriage to Annette was one area where Selgratis had pressed him furiously. He had even gone so far as to threaten to revoke his title, if he did not marry her.It was the first time that Selgratis had shown such resolve, and investment or not, Raphael had received a great deal from his father. He could not object. In the end, he had accepted.It was a forced marriage in every way.But I never would have expected that that woman would\u2026Raphael jerked away mid-thought. What could he be thinking? It was impossible. Automatically, he tried to think of something else, something that did not threaten to shatter everything he believed.Selgratis, nineteenth King of Deltium, laid his hand on Raphael\u2019s arm with no idea what was in his son\u2019s mind. Raphael frowned slightly; he did not like physical contact with anyone, but he did not resist. Not because Selgratis was his king.

He knew the King would tolerate it even if he was a bit caustic, especially when his mother was mentioned. The King sighed at his son\u2019s angry eyes.\u201cI know. If I had done something sooner, things might have been different. Your mother might not have felt like she had to do something so desperate. It is a great pity.\u201dHis expression darkened, and Raphael softened. He couldn\u2019t help it, whenever he saw that expression; in the end, they were the same blood. His eyes went to the King\u2019s hair, which had been as black as his own, in years past. It was hard to remain angry when he could see the years wearing on his father.\u201cIt is all in the past. Thanks to Your Majesty\u2019s grace, I live well.\u201dIt was a short reply, and a clear indication he did not want to talk about his mother any further. Selgratis decided to allow it.\u201cIs your marriage going well?\u201d\u201cAs it was arranged by Your Majesty, we will be sure to appear so,\u201d Raphael replied carelessly. Selgratis\u2019s eyes sharpened at the answer, eying his son curiously to see whether Raphael actually might be satisfied with his partner. But there was nothing to read in Raphael\u2019s stoic face.\u201cYou are two fundamentally different people, even if you are husband and wife,\u201d the King said, after a moment\u2019s consideration. \u201cDon\u2019t carelessly trust her, and don\u2019t tell her too much. Lady Annette may seem harmless, but she is still a woman of the Bavaria family. Put your own family first. There is no telling what plans she might concoct, should she discover any weakness. Understand?\u201dRaphael said nothing.In the past, he would have accepted those words without question, and engraved the warning on his heart. But suddenly he heard Annette\u2019s voice in his memory, and the words she had spoken the other day seemed to have gotten there first.Raphael, you are my family. So I want to\u2026protect you.It was a ridiculous thing to say. A woman who stood barely as high as his chest couldn\u2019t protect him. Her slender wrists were barely sufficient for wielding tableware. But somehow his heart twinged when he remembered her voice. Raphael rose from his seat, looking away to hide the look in his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving. Good health to you, Your Majesty.\u201dSelgratis did not reply. Raphael left the audience chamber, conscious of the King watching him silently. The palace was elegant but it had always felt stifling to him. Raphael felt too acutely that he did not belong there. Perhaps it was the dirty blood in his veins.Raphael headed for his carriage to return home. Annette had gone boating that day, and was probably already back at the mansion, waiting for him. He imagined how she would greet him, when he returned.What is this?Raphael\u2019s face hardened as a man suddenly stepped into his path. There was only one other man in the palace aside from Selgratis who shared Raphael\u2019s deep blue eyes. Raphael\u2019s eyes glittered coldly at a handsome, silver-haired man, who looked as if he might have been formed from the breath of winter.\u201cWe will talk for a moment, man to man,\u201d the other man said defiantly, as the Crown Prince of Deltium stepped from the shadows. He looked unusually somber, with a weight to his presence that could only come from the experience of loss, jealousy, and possessiveness.Raphael flashed a smile at the sight of those cruel eyes, always eager to wound him.\u201cI expected this,\u201d he said. Raphael was never one to avoid a fight that someone else had started. And it didn\u2019t matter what Ludwig said; it was just a barking from a dog that had already lost the fight. Raphael was already Annette\u2019s husband.Quietly, he followed Ludwig.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was very long, down to her waist, and her combing gradually slowed as she sank into deep thought.Raphael is late.She was worried something had happened at the palace. Perhaps he had been waylaid, drawn into a quarrel, or someone might have said something to provoke him. She knew these things had happened to a sickening degree ever since Raphael had earned his title, and much of that hostility had been carefully fostered in the public by her father.She sighed. Raphael was a proud man, and he would sooner bite his tongue and die than allow others to mock him. It was unfortunate that a man of such stubborn pride had been born illegitimate.Creak\u2026At that moment, the door to her room creaked open, and for a moment, she thought it was a ghost, it had opened so quietly. She turned her head to see who it was, and as she expected, there was only one person who would enter without knocking.\u201cRaphael?\u201dShe jolted at the surprise of seeing him in her doorway instead of at the palace, and when she saw his rigid face, dread filled her. She didn\u2019t know why, but it seemed he was in a bad mood.\u201cRaphael, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d She asked anxiously. \u201cDid something happen at the palace?\u201dShe asked the question kindly, despite the ominous expression on his face, and at the sweet tone, he clenched his jaw with a clear inner struggle to control his temper. That was surprising. Normally he would have vented his anger without thought. But he drew several deep breaths before he asked an abrupt question.\u201cIsn\u2019t it true that you said you hate men like me?\u201d\u201cWhat? Me?\u201d Her eyes widened at the sudden question, as startling as a bolt of lightning from a clear sky. Where was this coming from?\u201cBefore we were married, you said you would rather live alone the rest of your life than be my wife,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cOr die. Is that true? Did you really say that?\u201dAnnette tried to remember if she had ever said anything like that, but she couldn\u2019t. And she had never been the type of person to look down on others. Had Raphael heard some strange rumor somewhere?\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026remember anything like that. Did His Majesty say such a thing?\u201d Annette asked, remembering that Raphael had been at the palace that day.He did not answer. He approached her silently, a great shadow looming over her, and goosebumps rose instinctively. It was intimidating to have such a powerfully built man looking down at her with so fierce a face.\u201cA weakling said it,\u201d he said, bending his head nearer to hers. \u201cHe said a woman as refined as you could never love a bastard. He recalled that you said you would rather enter a convent than to marry common trash. That\u2019s what you said before, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cMe? I never said that\u2026oh!\u201d Annette\u2019s puzzled expression cleared as she realized it. It must have been Ludwig who said that. Maybe he had run into Raphael at the palace, or even waited for him, determined to hurt him. Vaguely, she remembered something Ludwig had said in the past.Perhaps my father is right. If he were legitimate, then he would surely be the Crown Prince. And then you would have to marry him instead. I hate to think of it! Would you be happier with him? Because he is more of a man?That had happened several years ago, and Ludwig had been so hurt that the King had compared him to Raphael. Tears filling his eyes, streaming down to the line of his elegant jaw. She remembered how those clear tears had glistened in the sunlight.At the time, she had also been something like his counselor. She had felt sorry for Ludwig, who was deeply wounded by his father\u2019s words. He was of higher birth than anyone else, but his self-esteem was incredibly low. He was so sensitive on this subject, it seems the least word might even push him to suicide.I wish he had never been born\u2026Ludwig\u2019s eyes had been chilling as he repeated these words. Annette thought it would be best to comfort him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was years ago, and even longer if she counted the time before her regression. But she likely had comforted Ludwig by saying something like that. That she did not want to marry Raphael, or anyone else but Ludwig.It had been an effective consolation. She remembered how Ludwig had wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes when he heard them, smiling. It was as if she had saved him.But I can\u2019t believe he told Raphael about that.Silently, she laid a hand on her forehead. Her head ached. It seemed the sensitive Ludwig had a temper as bad as Raphael\u2019s, when he was angry. And because he couldn\u2019t insult Raphael himself, he had used personal stories about Annette instead. And from a time before she had ever met Raphael, when she had comforted Ludwig out of simple compassion.And now that she understood what had happened, she was disappointed in Ludwig. It hurt her that he kept causing these unnecessary fights with Raphael, because he couldn\u2019t let go of her. She and Ludwig had spent a lot of time together when they were young, but the things he was doing were erasing those good memories.\u201cFrom the look on your face, it must be true,\u201d Raphael said, his frown deepening. His blue eyes hardened and grew cold. She knew that look well. She had gone through this same routine countless times in her last life.\u201cIt was a long time ago,\u201d she began. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you then. I was comforting His Highness because I felt sorry for him. His Majesty was always comparing him to yo\u2013\u201dRaphael grabbed her chin, and his thumb rubbed over her lips as if he were bruising the petals of flowers. His thumb was rough with calluses from sword training, and stopped her from speaking at once.\u201cYou are such a good liar,\u201d Raphael whispered in her ear, his voice filled with mocking affection. \u201cI almost believed it when you said you preferred marrying me to being Crown Princess. Sneaky Bavaria.\u201dRaphael\u2019s temper was wavering. The King had just warned him not to trust her, but he knew this wasn\u2019t fair, that he couldn\u2019t justly reproach her for something that happened before they were married, before they had ever even met each other.But the timing of this story, and the identity of the person that had told it to him, were like flint and steel.Ludwig was not the only one with an inferiority complex about his half-brother.Ludwig\u2019s lineage was perfect. Ludwig was the one who deserved to be beside the refined Annette. Raphael\u2019s jealousy was eating him up inside. He wanted to smash the Crown Prince\u2019s face. And the thing that pissed him off more than anything else was that Ludwig\u2019s stupid attack was working at all.What the hell was wrong with him? Why did he care what Annette thought of him in the first place?Raphael was questioning many things as he returned home. But with no satisfactory answer, his insides boiled as if he had swallowed molten iron. All his anxieties about his illegitimate birth, that a woman like Annette could never like him, churned inside him until they burst out, and all because of Ludwig, that thorn in his side.\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s terrible for you,\u201d he murmured, stroking her cheeks with his fingertips. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe you\u2019re married to a bastard. That the blood in my veins is the same as the man who ruined your life, the coachman who framed you for things you never did. You must be sick of me.\u201dAnnette just thought his face looked sad. The twisted grimace of a deeply hurt person. His blue eyes were gleaming like ice, but somehow that usual darkness was missing.\u201cNo,\u201d she said quickly, before he could think of something worse. \u201cReally, it\u2019s not what you think\u2026\u201d\u201cShh, Annette.\u201d One corner of his mouth turned up in a twisted smile. Suddenly, he lifted her, sliding her onto her dressing table. Both his hands caressed her back as he kissed her, his tongue flicking at her lips and darting between them. Their tongues coiled together.Annette squirmed, but his arms held her tight. She felt a burst of excitement as his tongue nipped her teeth.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Raphael whispered when their lips parted, his voice cold. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re my wife won\u2019t change, whether you like it or not.\u201dHe bit down hard on her slender collarbone, as if he were punishing her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he would only listen to himself, he would realize that he was the one that really hated himself.She didn\u2019t like where this was going. He was biting her, his hands roughly caressing her, and she reached out her arms and wrapped them around him. If she wanted him to stop, then pulling him closer worked better than trying to push him away. And she wasn\u2019t wrong. His hands froze in the middle of undressing her.\u201c\u2026why are you doing this?\u201d Raphael frowned and tried to pull back, as if her close embrace made him uncomfortable. But she only tightened her arms, hugging him as hard as she could.\u201cDo you really think I hate you?\u201d She asked, her voice small.His eyes went to her face silently. Her lips were reddened from his kiss, and her white shoulders were bared from her disarranged nightgown, her eyes wet. It made him feel bad to see her unhappy, especially as a tear slid down her small face, dripping from her chin and straight onto his heart, rippling. Raphael lifted a hand to her cheek, wanting to brush away her tears immediately.\u201cYou were the one who said it,\u201d Annette murmured sadly.\u201cWhat?\u201dHe stiffened in belated understanding. For a moment, he strangled, unable to answer. Because now that he thought about it, he had several times said outright that he hated her. His heart tightened as he realized he had done the thing he accused her of doing.And he had already hurt her deeply. Annette was exhausted from coping with his mercurial moods, and now defending herself over something she had said years before, when he had said far worse last week. Annette was frustrated, saddened, and so unhappy.Annette looked up at him, her arms still wrapped around his neck. She had thought that someday they would talk about this, and the moment she was honest about her feelings, then their relationship would end. But it didn\u2019t seem necessary now.\u201cI told you I don\u2019t hate you,\u201d she said tiredly, looking into his cold blue eyes. She felt miserable, like a flower wilting for lack of sunshine. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve always said. You\u2019re my husband. You\u2019re all I\u2019ve got\u2026so why do you keep talking like that?\u201dHer words were very direct.Raphael\u2019s face suddenly heated, and he had to turn away to hide his flushed cheeks as he understood what she was saying. It very nearly sounded like a confession of love, and his heart raced. He couldn\u2019t believe it.She sighed, her forehead resting against his hard shoulder.\u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you like me, even a little?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t answer.Her smile was cold as she lifted her head.\u201cI thought so,\u201d she murmured, resigned.***\u201cThat\u2019s why you ran away? You fool,\u201d laughed Harold, draining his glass. Raphael glared at him, but surprisingly did not retort. He knew there was nothing he could say if he had ten mouths.Raphael gulped down his liquor. If he could have drowned himself by burying his face in it and inhaling, he would have done so gladly.Do you like me, even a little?Her question still echoed in his ears. He had heard the sadness in her voice.Raphael shoved his black hair out of his face angrily. She hadn\u2019t even asked if he loved her. She had just asked if he liked her. And he hadn\u2019t even been able to answer that.\u201cDo you love her?\u201d Harold asked, leaning back on his couch.Rather than answer, Raphael tossed back another glass of liquor. His esophagus burned from overindulgence, but maybe that was the reason he could even begin the difficult conversation. Raphael swiped at his mouth with the back of his hand.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cHow can I know something I\u2019ve never felt?\u201d Raphael asked, in utter seriousness. He had never loved another person in his life. No family, no woman, and no one had ever loved him. The world he knew was cruel and unforgiving, and so he had killed off everything that made him weak, then channeled his rage into the sword. That was how he gained wealth and power enough to set himself above his enemies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From his perspective, it was suicide to put his heart in someone\u2019s else\u2019s hands. His pride forbade such carelessness in the name of something like love, especially when he had so many things to hide. Raphael would rather slit his own throat than let his shameful history be exposed.Better to just let her go.Raphael remembered the ring from the Guild of Secrets that Annette had hidden. It wasn\u2019t clear why she was patronizing them, but Raphael\u2019s primal instincts had a clue.There was intense worry in his sharp eyes.Looking at him, Harold shrugged inside. Anyone could see that he was in love, though it was a dangerous sort of love. Remembering the elegant, intelligent face of Annette, he couldn\u2019t believe one of the few really good girls in the world had fallen into the clutches of a man like Raphael. Of course she would suffer in their relationship.So Harold decided to help the poor girl.\u201dTsk. Love and jealousy are like a needle in your pocket,\u201d he said, a smile at his lips as he slyly goaded Raphael. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide it, no matter how hard you try. So if you\u2019re not sure\u2026well, then, I\u2019m afraid, in my opinion\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHarold paused, stroking his beard as he shrewdly allowed Raphael\u2019s annoyance to build. Raphael\u2019s eyes sharpened, frowning, and Harold waited right until his anger was about to explode to speak.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious. You can\u2019t have a feeling like love and not know. So you don\u2019t love her.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dFurious, Raphael objected at once, but then he couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. In the first place, why was he even upset about this? He was not a man that bothered with emotional games or romances. He shouldn\u2019t have been bothered at all. But strangely enough, Harold\u2019s words were unpleasant.And he wasn\u2019t done. After another sip of his drink, he puffed on a cigarette for a moment.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter, if there is no love. That\u2019s how marriage within the nobility works. I know a dozen couples who are only going through the motions of their marriage. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t do the same. Play with women you like, and when you get bored with them, go back home. Isn\u2019t that more convenient?\u201dSmiling, he exhaled a puff of smoke.\u201cOh, but that does mean your wife will do the same,\u201d he added, with his hand tapping his forehead as if he had just remembered. \u201cWhy should she waste the flower of her youth on a husband who doesn\u2019t love her. But you don\u2019t need to worry about it, if you keep treating her like this, you\u2019ll drive her into the arms of another man yourself. Then she\u2019ll only come back when she\u2019s tired of him. She\u2019ll be someone else\u2019s problem.\u201dRaphael cursed inside.Just imagining another man holding the beautiful body that only he knew, hearing her gasp, made his blood boil. If that happened, he\u2019d dismember the bastard, burn the body, and remember to stomp on the ashes.Even worse, he could picture the faces of three men right off the top of his head who would have wanted to sleep with her.He wanted to kill every one of them.The savagery that filled him on the battlefield hummed into his blood. He gritted his teeth, automatically bristling like a male beast defending his mate. He didn\u2019t understand these feelings, or why this was happening. His heart was boiling. He felt like he was losing his mind.Raphael gulped down the alcohol in his glass, then tossed back the last of it. Rising abruptly from the couch, he grabbed his coat. Somehow he had the idea that while he wasn\u2019t home, another man could be visiting Annette.Despite being drunk, Raphael was more lucid than before.\u201cI\u2019m leaving, old man.\u201d\u201cOh, wait, I almost forgot to tell you\u2026\u201d Harold began. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2026what was it? These things happen when you get older, give me a moment, I\u2019ll remember\u2026\u201dHarold made himself comfortable on the couch. Raphael didn\u2019t like Harold\u2019s insinuations, but when the old man spoke this way, he couldn\u2019t ignore it. It would surely be important information.He waited for Harold to speak. Harold had an odd smile as he looked at him, and offered some advice as if he were being generous.\u201cYou\u2019ll have some guests soon, so make sure you clean up your house. Didn\u2019t you know?

Not possible.Raphael frowned at the bad joke. The old man must have gone senile. He was talking nonsense. Harold was almost the only person Raphael socialized with. Raphael disliked people because he distrusted them, and he would never have invited anyone into his private space, or his home. But Harold paid no attention to his incredulous expression.\u201cI have heard through my informants that certain important people from the Chapelle Empire will be visiting Deltium for personal reasons. A vacation.\u201d\u201cWhat of it?\u201d Raphael asked, coldly indifferent. He had no reason to care if someone was visiting from the Chapelle Empire. Matters of state were the King\u2019s problem. Raphael was training to become a Master of Swords, just as King Selgratis wanted. Raphael turned away, uninterested.\u201dTsk. You don\u2019t seem very interested in your wife.\u201dRaphael stopped when he heard the tongue click behind him. He didn\u2019t understand what any of this had to do with Annette, and he turned back slowly, eying Harold suspiciously.Harold smiled, please. Raphael got grumpy every time his wife was mentioned. Even if wasn\u2019t love, he obviously had deep feelings for her. Even as an adult, Raphael still reminded Herald of a hedgehog, rolled up in a ball of spines and oblivious to anything else.\u201cPay more attention to your wife\u2019s family,\u201d Harold admonished. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a step ahead. Think about it. Who is in the Chapelle Empire?\u201dRaphael\u2019s eyebrows lifted as he finally understood. Annette was not an only child. Her brother\u2019s genius had exceeded the bounds of the small kingdom of Deltium, so he had gone to study abroad in the great empire, where he had ultimately gotten a job.It was unprecedented that the Chapelle Empire would allow a foreigner to hold such an important post, but Annette\u2019s brother had earned it. Succinctly, Arjen Bavaria had been very successful. It was another reason for Allamand to brag about his superior lineage.Imagining that arrogant man\u2019s face, Raphael gritted his teeth. If Arjen resembled his father, Raphael didn\u2019t want to see him, even if he was Annette\u2019s only brother.He didn\u2019t bother to show up at the wedding, why is he coming now?He was annoyed inside. The prodigy had been too busy to attend his only sister\u2019s wedding. It didn\u2019t make sense for him to show up so long afterward.But Harold\u2019s information was never wrong, so the time would come soon enough to meet him. Raphael felt uncomfortable just thinking of it. It wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if he had at least seen Arjen\u2019s face at the wedding.Despite his impressive career, Arjen was little known in Deltium itself. He had spent his youth studying in the Academy of the Chapelle Empire, and then been offered a job as soon as he graduated. Everyone praised him as a great man and knew nothing else about him, and that included Raphael.A rare genius. The son of the arrogant Allamand. Annette\u2019s brother. Raphael objected to all these things. He didn\u2019t understand why there were so many problems in the world. It would be wonderful if he could have just lived with Annette and forgot about everything else.Raphael startled at this thought, only vaguely aware that it was floating in there.He had better get home now.***Sitting on a tree branch, Railin swung his legs in a leisurely way. He liked bright colors like the sunset that was currently spread before him. It was a deep secret that his extravagantly red hair was not natural.But perhaps because he was getting older, today he found he preferred deepers to the vivid shades that hurt his eyes.Like the color of the hair of the woman on the balcony below him.Railin looked down at Annette, sleeping peacefully in the rocking chair. The colors of sunset were glowing on her pale blonde hair. Maybe that was why he suddenly had the urge to touch her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His shadow fell across Annette\u2019s face as he approached her rocking chair, but Annette sensed no danger. She was sound asleep, with her blonde hair falling over her cheeks.Beautiful hair.Railin tucked a blonde lock behind her ear, and Annette turned her head in her sleep with a soft noise of protest. Railin had hoped she would wake, but that was all. She seemed to be sleeping deeply, only stirring as if she were dreaming.\u201cOh. I\u2019ll never finish my work this way.\u201dRailin smiled sourly. He had two reasons for visiting today: to bring the information she had requested last time about immigrating illegally to Osland, and to sell her information about an unexpected visitor. Though Railin sometimes showed up unannounced, he always had a reason. He was a busy man.Apparently he had picked the wrong time now. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to wake her when she was sleeping so peacefully.Last time, she had shown him her tearful face, and now she showed her sleeping face. She was a strange woman, bold enough to infiltrate the temple, yet timid enough to be frightened by the sight of him dressed up as one of the temple statues. Remembering her surprised face, with tears of fright in her eyes, a smile appeared at his lips.I can\u2019t get enough of looking at her.Tilting his head, he examined her face. She looked like a porcelain doll, with those long eyelashes and flushed cheeks. Her breathing was so soft, it was almost inaudible.He reached out a hand to check if she was alive, and suddenly the book she had been reading slipped from her lap and fell to the ground. Curiously, he picked it up, wondering what sort of book such a refined lady would be reading. His eyes widened at the title.Interrogation Methods to Secure Confessions from Uncooperative SubjectsFurther down was an even more gruesome subtitle in smaller print that read, Including simple but effective of methods of torture!Railin\u2019s disbelieving gaze flicked repeatedly from the brutal book to Annette\u2019s peaceful face, and a chuckle escaped him.What a funny woman. It was fortunate that she was planning to leave her husband and go to Osland. Railin was sure his chance would come eventually.A rare smile appeared on his handsome face.***Annette woke with a start.It seemed she had fallen asleep reading in her rocking chair on the balcony. She had been quite troubled by her encounter with Celestine at the Temple.Annette couldn\u2019t tell if Celestine\u2019s words had been true. And in the case that neither of them were guilty of the kidnapping, then who else could have planned it?Her thoughts only became more confused as her reference books became more vicious. If she ever ran into that coachman, Ivan\u2026she really wanted to question him. She had to know who had been behind all of this.But she wasn\u2019t going to find an answer now, no matter how much she worried about it. It was dark out, and the wind blowing in from the garden was quite cold. At this rate, she was going to end up getting sick again.As she rose from her chair, the coat covering her body fell to the ground, and Annette\u2019s eyes widened as she picked it up.A man\u2019s coat?For a moment, she wondered if Raphael had covered her with it before he left. But the coat was too garish to be Raphael\u2019s, a dark wine color trimmed with gold braid. Raphael would never wear a coat like this.Annette\u2019s head tilted to one side as she caught the scent of cologne on the coat, strangely sensual. She knew who owned this coat.Her sleepy eyes narrowed.\u201cRailin, are you here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But there was nothing. He must have left, since she had been sleeping, and it was an unwanted intrusion in any case. She couldn\u2019t even ask the reason for his visit.Embarrassed, she looked at his coat. It looked expensive. It would be best to wash it before she returned it.She was used to dealing with a reliable Railin. He was much more competent than she had initially thought, and she had even considered consulting him about the false charges against her, to ask for his help. It seemed like a good idea.But no, she shouldn\u2019t be hasty. She had to think it over more carefully.After she had calmed herself, she entered the house, wrapping a warm shawl around her shoulders that made her feel much more comfortable. It was late for dinner, but she was very hungry. She had napped on the balcony for far too long.Meaning to find a quick bite to eat, Annette went downstairs at exactly the wrong moment. As she passed the front doors, she bumped into Raphael, who had just come home. She felt a pang at the thought of their last conversation.She entered the room, after calming her mind. She put on a warm shawl, which made her feel much more at ease. It was late for dinner, but she was quite hungry. She had fallen asleep on the balcony too long.Annette went downstairs with the intention of grabbing a quick bite to eat. But it was not a good time. It was because when she was near the front door, she bumped into Raphael who had just returned home. Annette felt a pang of pain as she remembered the last conversation she had with him.Do you like me, even a little?He had left without answering the question, and the desolation of that moment still hadn\u2019t left her. Annette moved past him without speaking, close enough that she could feel his breath on her cheek.He smells like alcohol.He must have gone out drinking again somewhere. In her previous life, Raphael had drunk almost every day, as if he were an alcoholic, because he couldn\u2019t sleep otherwise. But in this life he drank surprisingly rarely, with Annette there to put him to sleep with her magic.Except on days like today.But Annette did not escape so easily. Suddenly, Raphael caught her arm, his cold eyes narrowed with anger.\u201cI smell another man on you.\u201dShe turned to him as he approached her, grabbing her shoulders and bending his head, his nose moving through her hair, behind her ears, along her neck and over her collarbone, catching the unfamiliar smell.Annette could smell the strong whiskey on his breath. Reflexively, she pulled back. It was overwhelming to be so close to him anyway, when emotionally they were so far apart. But caught in his firm grip, it was impossible to get away. Raphael tilted her chin up with one hand.\u201cWho was it?\u201d He asked finally, his eyes fierce. \u201cWho touched you? Tell me!\u201d\u201cNo one. Please let me go,\u201d she said, low. At first, she thought he was just making a fuss because he was drunk, but then the thought flashed through her mind of Railin and his coat, and the scent of his cologne that must have clung to her clothing and skin as she slept.But that didn\u2019t mean she could confess this truth to Raphael. She couldn\u2019t reveal Railin\u2019s existence if she wanted to hide her relationship with the Guild of Secrets. Carefully, she removed Raphael\u2019s hand from her shoulder.\u201cI was testing new perfumes to buy,\u201d she answered, trying not to provoke him. \u201cMaybe some of them are lingering on me. Who else but you would ever touch me? Besides, I haven\u2019t left the house. So please let go of me. It hurts.\u201dHe had always been vulnerable when she said something hurt, and his hands immediately relaxed as soon as the word left her mouth. She immediately took the opportunity to flee.\u201cI think you\u2019re drunk, so you should get some rest,\u201d she said, once she thought she was a safe distance away. She turned her head to offer a brief goodbye. \u201cGood night, Raphael.\u201dThat was it. Quickly, she walked away before he could stop her. But before she had gone three steps, a hard hand caught her from behind, and Raphael pulled her back against his chest.\u201cRaphael?\u201d\u201cLiar. You always lie to me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She tried to look back at him, but couldn\u2019t when he was holding her so tightly in his arms. Twisting her head, she could barely see his chin. His red lips in his square jaw looked enticingly manly.He kissed her head, then bit her earlobe. And then those lips twisted for a moment, as if he were going to cry.\u201cWhat am I going to do with you, Annette?\u201dHis hot breath sighed against her forehead, tingling. His voice sounded sad, but that was probably just her imagination. Annette lowered her gaze.\u201cWhy are you suddenly acting this way?\u201d She asked, with a smile as superficial as if they were meeting at a society event. \u201cYou don\u2019t even like me. We have a relationship where we merely fulfill our duties. Isn\u2019t this the marriage you wanted?\u201dHer beautiful voice recited the words coldly, and Raphael absorbed them in silence, then hugged her tighter. It felt as if she was too far away from him, even though she was pressed right against his heart, an estrangement.Raphael bent his head to kiss her pale neck.\u201cYou are right,\u201d he said, with clear intent. \u201cLet us do our duty to each other.\u201dAnnette frowned, pushing him away at his shoulder, but Raphael caught her slender wrist and reached out his other hand to grasp her chin. His bright blue eyes were reddened with drink, but they were filled with sadness rather than lust.\u201cDon\u2019t push me away like that. Every time you do\u2026it makes me feel like I\u2019ll go crazy.\u201dTo her ears, his voice sounded like the cry of a wounded animal. Her arms relaxed the moment she heard those words, because Annette could not harden herself against his distress.Raphael lifted her up by the waist to carry her into the bedroom. As soon as he laid her on the bed, his lips captured her like shackles. She could not resist the passionate kiss.She wanted to push him away several times, but pinned in his arms, she finally closed her eyes. She didn\u2019t understand how he could do this if he didn\u2019t like her. But there was no point in bothering to ask him again.The cool night air caressed her n@ked body as he pulled off her nightgown and pushed her legs apart sharply. Annette bit her lip in embarrassment as he exposed the space between her legs, clearly lit in the light of the oil lamp. But Raphael had no mercy. His fingers dipped between her legs.\u201cAhh!\u201dThe short, pained moan escaped her lips as her not-quite-wet v@ginal walls bit down on his fingers. Impatiently, Raphael withdrew them.When he bent his head between her legs, she could feel his breath on her most sensitive spot, and soon his lips covered her cl!toris. Every time the clever tip of his tongue licked her, she jerked.\u201cAhhh, I don\u2019t like it,\u201d she said, her eyes dazed with pleasure. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201dAnnette clutched his head, her legs trembling. Her white fingers tangled in his black hair, dark as night. Though her mind was closed to it, her body reacted honestly to the pl3asure. Raphael devoured her slippery opening like a wild beast.His soft lips brushed her petals apart until he could thrust his tongue into her, a wet noise echoing through the room with every darting motion. Her opening was completely soaked, and her mind began to reel.Once her entrance was wet, Raphael slipped two fingers into her, and Annette held back her moans, trying to resist the pl3asure filling her.Her inner walls were so narrow that it was a tight fit at first, but gradually she softened as he rubbed at her cl!toris.Annette felt the warmth spreading within her as if she had been drinking. The time had come to kindle the flame of desire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Each time he inserted them and rubbed her cl!toris, she tightened inside, contracting. The feeling of the thick knuckles of his fingers inside her made her tingle. She got hot. Her n!pples hardened. She couldn\u2019t catch her breath.Raphael licked his lips as he felt her inner walls squeezing. She was so hot inside, clinging to his fingers, and he wanted to shove his c0ck into that hungry hole right now. But it wasn\u2019t time yet.\u201cYour waist is shaking,\u201d he told her, sounding a little displeased. \u201cBut I still have work to do, so try to stay still.\u201dAnnette reddened in embarrassment at the vulgar implication, and tears welled in her pink eyes, flowing down her cheeks. Raphael leaned over to lick her tears, so intensely focused it was as if he were feasting at her cheeks.It would have been nice if his lips were poison. Then he could have blinded those beautiful eyes so that she would never look on another man.Annette was so nervous, she didn\u2019t even notice the possessiveness in his gaze. But she turned away, a little fearful of his tongue licking near her eyes. Abruptly, his fingers withdrew, and his c0ck thrust into her tight hole. Annette cried out.\u201cAhh! Slow, slowly\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what your mouth says, but your insides are squeezing me. You\u2019re soaking wet.\u201dWith a fierce grin, he drove his manhood all the way into her, her stomach aching at the stretch of his big c0ck. Annette rubbed her lower belly, feeling that she would explode if this kept up. Raphael\u2019s teeth gritted at the sight.\u201cI told you not to provoke me.\u201d\u201cAhh!!! Mmm!!!\u201dHe surged into her, pounding inside her, then slid back to rub himself hard against her inner walls. The wave of pleasure rolled through her, lust boiling in her blood. Gasping, Annette spread her legs wider.Instantly, his pace increased, hitting her like a tidal wave. Tingling washed through her body, her breath gasping with every thrust.\u201cYou\u2019re covered with another man\u2019s smell, and you still seem to be unsatisfied,\u201d Raphael accused as he pounded into her, and Annette shook her head, in tears. The pathetic denial only provoked the beast more.Raphael rubbed his cheeks against her neck, and then licked insistently, as if he wanted to cover the other male\u2019s scent with his own.When she lowered her head, the sensation of his thrusts only became more intense. Annette was suffocating. She tried to draw back, overwhelmed by the relentless assault of his body into hers.But Raphael immediately grunted, gripping her @ss hard and shoving himself into her as deep as he could go. It was an aggressive retaliation, as if punishing her for retreating.\u201cAhh!!!\u201dAnnette\u2019s wet eyes went wide, and Raphael lowered his head to devour her lips. His hot tongue roamed her mouth, tasting every inch. Both above and below, Annette felt herself being conquered by him.Raphael\u2019s lips parted as his waist moved still more violently, his p3netration even rougher, his c0ck pounding into her with the force of a hammer blow.The stimulation was breathtaking. The rubbing of his c0ck head inside her was lighting her on fire, hotter and hotter until something exploded, and thrilling org@sm burst through her quivering insides.\u201cMmm! Ahhh\u2026!!!\u201dTears flowed under her lashes as she squeezed her eyes shut. Raphael kissed her sweaty forward, clenching his teeth to hold back his own climax. The sight of her beautiful face, filled with pleasure, was captivated. Annette trembled helplessly under those eyes, which seemed to want to devour her completely.Raphael sat back against the headboard, lifting Annette\u2019s still-quivering body on top of him. Without hesitating, he slid his c0ck back inside her.\u201cI\u2019m not finished yet.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Annette quivered. In this position, it felt as if he went even deeper, as if she were being impaled upon a huge stake.\u201cAh\u2026it\u2019s so hard\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? It shouldn\u2019t hurt. I got you wet enough to make you open,\u201d he said. \u201cWet enough to make sure you never think of another man again\u2026\u201dThe possessive words sent a shiver down her spine.Then her body began to jolt up and down wildly, as if his shaft would split her body. Sitting upright, it rubbed deep inside her, an overwhelming sensation that made her cling to his shoulders, sobbing. She didn\u2019t even have the strength to scream. It felt as if he would pound her to jelly inside.But clinging to him only fueled his desire. Raphael caught her waist and pulled her down lustfully, as if he wanted to thrust even his throbbing balls inside her.\u201cYou were covered in another man\u2019s scent, huh?\u201d His big hands caught her face, turning it up. \u201cYou haven\u2019t shown this eager face to anyone else, have you?\u201dAnnette\u2019s face was flushed as she looked up at him, panting. The light clearly showed the desire in her face, but she couldn\u2019t hide it. The sight of that face with her wet eyes was so exciting, Raphael thought he could come just by looking at her.\u201cDoes it feel good? You\u2019re moving your waist.\u201dHis hand reached over her belly to rub her cl!toris, and she couldn\u2019t stand the intense pl3asure that rolled through her body. But there was no escape when she was pinned on top of him.Mercilessly, he continued thrusting into her, fanning the fire inside her even hotter. The smacks as their skins collided echoed through the room, and Annette\u2019s eyes rolled back at every low-level org@sm.\u201cYour insides are squeezing my c0ck,\u201d he moaned. \u201cSo good, Annette\u2026\u201dThe sound of her muffled moans filled his ears and blurred his mind. Raphael gripped one of her br3asts in his hand, his calloused fingers plucking her soft n!pple. Her hot body accepted even that as pl3asure, and he drew her into his mouth, his tongue coiling obscenely around her n!pple.\u201cYour br3asts taste so good.\u201d Raphael licked wet lips. She hated those lips, that only spoke crude words. Annette lowered her head tearfully and kissed him, sealing his lips closed. The moment her lips touched his, she felt him swell even bigger inside her.He squeezed her @ss so hard, he left the marks of his hands on her skin, thrusting into her harder, faster, and Annette came so hard, it felt as if her whole body was floating.\u201cAhh!\u201d She moaned, tears filling her eyes, and Raphael drank them down between his lips as her tight inner walls squeezed him.I want to be with her forever\u2026Raphael kissed her forehead, the corners of her eyes, her cheeks.His eyes glittered with passion, nearly obsession. He still disliked the subtle scent of another man, lingering behind her shoulders.But Annette was a virtuous woman, who wasn\u2019t about to spread her legs for another man. Raphael trusted her more than she thought he did. But it disgusted him to know another male was close enough to cover her in his scent.He didn\u2019t believe her lie about trying new perfumes. But it didn\u2019t really matter. He would cover that perfume, or whatever it was, with himself. He would come inside her until she knew she belonged to him.He didn\u2019t know where this intense possessiveness was coming from. It made him angry every time she tried to push him away with those beautiful hands. As she said, he had wanted a formal marriage where they did nothing more but fulfill their obligations.So why did his heart fall the moment she said that?Raphael laid her on the bed and settled himself between her still-trembling white legs.The night had just begun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It felt as if she had slept until nearly noon. It wasn\u2019t surprising. Whenever she had s3x with Raphael, it was difficult to get up early the next day.Annette tried to rise to her feet, only to find Raphael\u2019s sturdy arms wrapped tightly around her. The line of his jaw at her forehead felt a little rough, stubbled from the growth of his beard overnight. Annette looked up at his face, bewildered.Why the hell is this man like this?It was Raphael that had always guarded the distance in both their relationships. It probably wasn\u2019t because of any affection that he had clung to her so determinedly last night. It was just because he thought another man had taken an interest in one of his possessions.It was too wearing on her heart to be swayed by his whims. It would be best to leave for Osland as soon as she could, before she developed any further attachment to him, especially under these circumstances. But before she could do that, she needed to get to the bottom of the accusations against her, and find the real culprit.Annette sat up, pushing his arms away, and Raphael frowned but did not wake up. She wondered what would happen if he did. Leaving the warmth of the bed, she slipped from the covers.But the moment she set her feet on the floor, her vision was suddenly dizzy. Her breath felt hot. There was a stinging in her throat, as if she had a cold. Perhaps it was because she had slept in the cold wind on the balcony.Of course, the strenuous use to which her body had been subjected afterward might also be a factor. Remembering the events of the previous night, Annette was embarrassed.Making her way to the table, Annette fortunately found a thick robe on the chair. She slipped it on and made her way downstairs. It seemed the time had come to test the skills of her newly hired doctor.And as she had hoped, the doctor was as competent as she remembered.\u201cYou have a cold.\u201dHer tonsils were especially swollen, and her throat ached as if there were tiny shards of glass in it. Eucaly\u2019s expression darkened as she took Annette\u2019s temperature. The fever was much higher than expected.\u201cI will prescribe a febrifuge, to reduce your fever. Please keep warm today and go to bed early. Drink all the water you can.\u201dAnnette nodded.\u201cIf you would like, I can give you a tonic to help restore your energy. If you take it regularly, you\u2019ll be much stronger.\u201d\u201cI would appreciate it. Please do.\u201dAfter Eucaly departed to get the medicine, Annette was left alone on the couch in the drawing room, and she lay back, closing her eyes. Eucaly had told her to go to bed early, but Raphael was still sleeping in her room. If she laid down beside him, her body would be warm, but her heart would be cold.But she also didn\u2019t want to go to Raphael\u2019s room, even if it was empty. Where could she go to sleep? As Annette ran her fingers through her hair, fretting, she was startled by the heat of her forehead.Tap-tap\u2026At that moment, a maid approached with a message. Annette frowned, puzzled.\u201cA visitor? But I\u2019m not expecting anyone\u2026\u201dWhen one visited the residence of a noble, usually a request was sent in advance, indicating when they would arrive and on what business. The visit would not occur without the head of the family granting permission. This protocol was the most basic etiquette for social calls in Deltium\u2019s aristocratic society.Of course, if it was a close relationship, there was no need for these formalities. But few people were close enough to Annette to ignore it. Who on earth would dare to visit her in this rude way?\u201cWho is it?\u201d Annette asked, slightly dazed with fever.\u201cWell\u2026I am sure it is a noblewoman, but she hasn\u2019t given her family. She just said she would like to have a private conversation with you. She said you would probably agree,\u201d the maid added, \u201cif I showed you this.\u201dAnnette\u2019s eyes widened as she looked at the object the maid produced. They were an ordinary pair of gloves, which could be purchased anywhere. But one of the gloves clearly showed the marks of teeth. As if someone had bitten it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And who had left those marks on them.Celestine Keers?Annette\u2019s eyes twitched. Surely, she had come to talk about something important. It had been days since their meeting at the temple, and Annette had not heard of Celestine making any accusations that Annette had infiltrated the Temple, much less providing the gloves as evidence.Instead, she had come secretly to request a private conversation. Annette\u2019s eyes lit up at a sudden thought.Maybe she\u2019s willing to hear what I have to say.The last time they had met, Celestine had been so fearful and cautious, still suffering from the trauma of her kidnapping. And there had been no doubt in her face that the true culprit was Annette.Of course, Annette had explained that she wasn\u2019t responsible, but she didn\u2019t think that was sufficient to persuade her. After all, what criminal in the world would say anything else? Unless Celestine was a fool, it was natural that she would still doubt.But apparently Annette had been wrong.She wished Celestine had come another day, when she felt less ill, but she could hardly refuse her when Celestine had come to her front door. It must have taken great determination for her to come this far. And if Annette refused her this time, Celestine wasn\u2019t likely to try it again.There was no choice.With her mind made up, Annette opened her eyes to look at the maid. The woman looked anxious, as if she thought Annette might scold her.\u201cCan you help me get dressed?\u201d Annette asked practically, offering her a small smile. \u201cI must greet my guest.\u201d***It felt as if her corset were digging into her ribs today. Perhaps that was why, along with her stuffy nose, that it felt so difficult to breathe. Annette took a sip of tea to clear her throat.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to come see me like this,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again, Lady Keers.\u201dCelestine did not speak. She looked so nervous, it seemed doubtful that she had come this way of her own free will. Her hands on the skirt of her dress were trembling, and she seemed to be struggling with her fears.Silently, Annette cupped her warm teacup in her hands and waited. There was nothing more she could do, and the hot tea seemed to be helping a little with her cold.\u201cI had a strange dream recently,\u201d Celestine said, after a while. Her face was somber. \u201cYou were in it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Really?\u201dOf course, Celestine wasn\u2019t talking about an actual dream. She was referring to Annette\u2019s visit at the Temple, but Annette just smiled vaguely. She wasn\u2019t going to admit anything when she didn\u2019t yet know Celestine\u2019s intentions.I must speak carefully. Otherwise I may say something that sounds like a confession.A cold sweat broke out on her body. Her first impulse was to think Celestine\u2019s visit was a good thing, but she still could not be trusted. Thinking of everything she had done, trespassing in the Temple, impersonating a priestess, Annette was shocked at her own recklessness.\u201cI suppose the reason you\u2019ve come is because you wondered if I might be innocence?\u201d She remarked, addressing the subject in a roundabout fashion.\u201cYour\u2026innocence?\u201dCelestine looked at her, a little disbelieving. It seemed she was still reluctant to say the word innocent. Despite their last meeting, she still didn\u2019t trust her. Annette sighed inwardly.\u201cCelestine, I really didn\u2019t order your kidnapping,\u201d she explained calmly. \u201cMy coachman Ivan was hired under a false identity, and after he kidnapped you, he framed me. The whole thing was a plan laid by someone else to discredit both of us.\u201dCelestine said nothing. Annette had no choice but to offer a little more, to persuade someone clearly still skeptical.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But now\u2026from your expression, I realize I was wrong.\u201dShe spoke as frankly as she could, hoping that honesty would win Celestine\u2019s understanding, and open her heart.\u201cI want to work with you to find the real criminal,\u201d she went on. \u201cI want to know who framed me for the crime, and left you with trauma that will never go away. But I need your help. Can you trust me?\u201dAnxiously, Annette waited for her answer. It was her best effort to persuade her, but Celestine was still looking at her suspiciously, as if she was searching for some sign in Annette\u2019s face that she was lying. Annette couldn\u2019t help wondering what she was seeing, and kept her eyes fixed on Celestine, trying to reach her.After a long silence, Celestine finally spoke, her expression heavy.\u201c\u2026when I was selected to be a candidate for Crown Princess, my parents were overjoyed,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though I was just the optional candidate, and you were supposed to be Crown Princess. They said it was an honor just to be considered with the famous Lady Annette Bavaria. As you probably know, my family has not\u2026prospered.\u201dThe Keers Marquisate had once been a very prosperous family, two hundred years ago. They owned a fairly large farm beside a very big river, so they never had to worry about droughts or irrigation. Over time, this had made them one of the wealthiest families, and they thought their prosperity would last forever.But there was no human being that could avoid natural calamities, and when there was a terrible earthquake in their lands, they suffered a great deal of destruction and death. The disaster was so complete, they almost bankrupted their house, trying to restore everything.But that was not the only misfortune. The earthquake had changed the shape of the earth itself, and changed the course of the river. Irrigation of the farm was far more difficult, and their crop yields had decreased by nearly half.That had been the beginning of the downfall of the Keers family.More than two hundred years later, they were nobles in name only. The Keers family had less prestige than the average earl.Until Celestine Keers had been chosen as the first candidate for Crown Princess.\u201cHuuhh.\u201dCelestine sighed deeply as she thought of her family, remembering the happy faces of her parents. Even Celestine herself had never dreamed she might actually become Crown Princess. It was a turn of events that had been impossible to predict.\u201cThough I\u2019m in no position to say this, I have no affinity for the Crown Prince,\u201d she went on. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for him. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not interested in the position of Crown Princess. It is a great opportunity for me and for my family.\u201dHer gaze drifted down to the ring she wore on her left ring finger. It had a large diamond in the center and a band filled with emeralds, rubies, and sapphires. It must be an engagement ring given to her by the royal family. Celestine touched the diamond with her gloved fingers.\u201cBut I would not do something so cowardly to become Crown Princess, much less stoop to such tricks. My family might be weak compared to Bavaria, but we still have pride. I will swear by the Keers name that I am only a victim. I did not plan my own kidnapping.\u201dHer voice rose with passion through this speech, her frustration evident. Annette was surprised by this turn in the conversation. She had thought Celestine had come to resolve her own suspicions as to whether Annette was guilty, but here she was insisting on her own innocence. Maybe she was insulted at Annette\u2019s suggestion that she had planned her own kidnapping.Celestine stared at Annette, her eyes waiting. Under the scrutiny of those dark green eyes, Annette answered softly.\u201cI see. I understand you.\u201d\u201c\u2026what do you mean, you understand me?\u201d\u201cI mean I trust you. In fact, it seemed strange to me from the beginning. You didn\u2019t seem like a person that used such dirty tactics.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person did you consider me?\u201d Celestine asked at once, aggressive in her confusion.A normal person might have answered sharply, but she was dealing with Annette, whose husband had significant anger management issues.\u201cYou\u2019re a proud woman,\u201d Annette answered, smiling.\u201cOh?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn\u2019t think you would do anything so undignified. Of course, sometimes I was frightened by the way you looked at me, but from the bottom, you\u2019re a person of integrity, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026?\u201dCelestine\u2019s expression had hardened. It wasn\u2019t that she was angry; Annette\u2019s words had sounded something like a compliment, and she automatically frowned, hiding her embarrassment. Annette smiled as she watched Celestine\u2019s reaction.\u201cSo when that incident happened\u2026I was disappointed, because I thought you had planned it. I thought you weren\u2019t that kind of person. But if you\u2019re not the culprit\u2026I can\u2019t think of who it might be. Who would have planned something like this?\u201d\u201cI thought\u2026you did it,\u201d Celestine said, finally opening her heart for the first time. \u201cBut it seemed strange to me\u2026\u201dAnnette listened with rapt attention.\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to do that to me,\u201d Celestine said, her eyes lowered with embarrassment. \u201cIt was obvious that you would be Crown Princess! Why would you do something so dangerous, when my chances were already zero? No matter how much I think about it, it endangers you more than it benefits you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re that stupid.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026you mean, you believe me?\u201d Annette covered her mouth in amazement. She had thought that Celestine must have suspected her innocence to some extent, to have come here at all, but this was the first time she had admitted it outright.Celestine\u2019s face turned red.\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me!\u201d Celestine said haughtily. \u201cI still don\u2019t fully trust you.\u201dMaybe the tension between them had eased, at least enough for her true personality to appear. Enough for tears to appear in Annette\u2019s eyes. Was it because Celestine had shouted at her?Celestine\u2019s heart twinged, and just as she was about to apologize, Annette spoke.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, wiping away her tears. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time someone else believed I was innocent. I couldn\u2019t help crying. Thank you so much, Celestine. It means a lot to me that you believed me.\u201dShe smiled sadly, closing her reddened eyes, and Celestine felt her heart clench. She had been so immersed in her own misery, she had never considered Annette\u2019s position, until now. She had even hated her for what she thought she had done.Celestine only had to close her eyes to remember the day she was kidnapped. The stranger\u2019s hand clamped over her mouth. The suffocating terror that he might be dragging her away to r@pe her, even though he had never touched her. Cowering in the darkness, shivering as she wondered what would become of her.Fortunately, she had been rescued without incident. But the nightmare of that day still haunted her. More than once, she had awakened screaming. Though as Crown Princess she was surrounded by glamor and luxury, she was not happy. She despised Annette for the terrible trauma she had suffered.Were you invited to Lady Bavaria\u2019s wedding? It was so beautiful! The groom\u2019s background is not the best, but that face is compensation, isn\u2019t it? Such a handsome man. Perhaps that\u2019s why Lady Bavaria seemed so happy. Even if she doesn\u2019t get to be Crown Princess, it\u2019s good fortune to live with such a man. She\u2019s a smart woman.Celestine listened to all this snide gossip and knew that she now occupied the position of Crown Princess in Annette\u2019s place. She would now suffer the jealousy of others. Celestine had always stubbornly kept herself on the fringes of society, and now everyone was eagerly searching for a way to take a bite of her.Gods, the new Crown Princess doesn\u2019t know how to treat people properly. It would have been so much better if Lady Bavaria had become Crown Princess instead\u2026All those pink, painted lips spoke only slander. Unable to shake off the psychological shadows of her kidnapping, Celestine began to be afraid to go out socially at all. When she left her home, all she found was enemies. Even her best friend, Lady McClaire, could not hide her jealousy.Celestine\u2019s only refuge was in the arms of God. That was the only place her beleaguered heart could feel safe.And then a few days ago, even that sanctuary had been destroyed.That was why Celestine had visited Annette.Partly pride, partly curiosity. In fact, Celestine had had her own doubts about the kidnapping.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And why would she be so foolish as to have her personal coachman do it? It made no sense. If Celestine had been in Annette\u2019s position, she would have hired mercenaries to do it instead, so nothing would link her to the crime.It didn\u2019t add up.At first, when Annette had slipped into the temple to see her, Celestine had refused to believe her. It was too much, to have this woman stalking her. But once she had cooled off, she thought about what Annette had said. It made sense.Later, Celestine had realized she was halfway persuaded.Maybe Annette really wasn\u2019t to blame.In that moment, it was as if she had glimpsed the shadow of some giant, holding both herself and Annette in the palm of his hand. It wasn\u2019t clear what this person would gain from the incident, but they had ruined the lives of two women in the process.And Celestine was a proud woman, who couldn\u2019t endure the thought that her life and her future were being manipulated by someone else. Though she had become the Crown Princess when she knew even in her next life she should have had no hope, it only happened because Annette was falsely accused.How could anyone get over a woman like Annette? Celestine eyed her discreetly. She still remembered the shock she had felt the first time she saw Lady Annette Bavaria, amazed that such a woman could exist in the real world. Among the aristocrats of Deltium, there was a book called The Perfect Lady that might have been written about Annette. She was beautiful, elegant, intelligent, and her family was impeccable. She was something beyond human.In a competition, one must first closely observe the opponent. Celestine understood her own position well. She was already at a disadvantage when the Crown Prince was already devoted to Annette. Her own chances were nonexistent.So Celestine had given up any thoughts of becoming Crown Princess herself. She had been satisfied to take advantage of the attention her nomination brought, which would win her a good husband in the future. It was a realistic goal when she knew she had no chance of surpassing Annette.I can\u2019t believe Annette is now Marquise Carnesis.It made Celestine uncomfortable. To become a Marquise was a high status for any woman, but for Annette, the daughter of Duke Bavaria, it could not be considered a good match. Especially given the rumors about the Raphael, the King\u2019s bastard.Celestine had taken comfort in the thought that Annette had brought about her own downfall, but knowing that she too might have been a victim made her feel as if the world had turned upside down. She was in the position Annette was meant to occupy. It was as if they had called in someone off the street to stand in for a lady.\u201cLady Annette, how\u2026do you feel about it now?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help asking, surprising herself with the question. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026I mean, is your husband treating you well?\u201dAnnette\u2019s eyes widened at the sudden question.\u201cYes,\u201d she said belatedly, with a soft smile. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man, even if he is a little rough. He treats me well.\u201dShe\u2019s lying.Annette was avoiding her gaze. She was a good liar, as might be expected from a member of the Bavaria family, and it was not a harmful lie, but a kindly one, to cover up her husband\u2019s shortcomings. But not Celestine thought she understood Annette\u2019s true feelings.Celestine\u2019s shoulders slumped with a sudden release of tension. She had had to be so cautious since she had been made the presumptive Crown Princess. But having talked to Annette, she could finally relax.\u201cThat luminous power you showed that day,\u201d Celestine said, touching the engagement ring on her finger. \u201cWas it real? Tell me the truth.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry. It was a trick,\u201d Annette confessed sheepishly. \u201cI did it so I could talk to you.\u201dCelestine should have been angry at the lie, but she was quite relieved. God was just. It would not have been right for an agnostic like Annette to have such power. Satisfied to have this mystery solved, she returned to her main point.\u201cThen if it wasn\u2019t either of us who did it, who is to blame?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I haven\u2019t come close to any conclusions, yet,\u201d Annette replied thoughtfully. \u201cI tried to find the squires from the palace who supported my coachman\u2019s testimony, but they have all disappeared. The true culprit only chose witnesses who had no connections anywhere else.\u201dShe had no idea who it was, but they had been quite meticulous. Having believed that Celestine was the guilty party, it was disheartening to have to start from the beginning again to prove her innocence. Annette\u2019s face fell.\u201cActually, I may have an idea,\u201d Celestine began, very carefully. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t speak rashly, but\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Annette asked seriously, angling her head. \u201cDo you have some idea? Or some suspect?\u201dBut Celestine hesitated. It was such a dangerous suspicion, she wasn\u2019t sure she even dared to say it aloud.Annette waited, her heart thudding at the thought that perhaps Celestine might know something after all. But pressing her too forcefully was likely to be counterproductive, so she waited, letting Celestine make up her own mind.It was a touching consideration, and Celestine had just opened her mouth to speak when the drawing room door burst open, and someone entered abruptly.\u201cI heard you are ill again, is it true?\u201d Raphael said, immediately approaching Annette and frowning as he laid his hand on her forehead. It was so strange how he had always worried about her health, to the point that even his bad temper vanished whenever she got sick.Before she could protest, he had already thoroughly examined her, and clicked his tongue disapprovingly.\u201cYou have a fever, and your eyes are red. Is it because you overexerted yourself yesterday? You ought to be in bed if you are not well\u2013\u201dAs he straightened, he suddenly noticed Celestine\u2019s presence, and his mouth shut at once. For a moment, he was disconcerted to have a visitor present, but his confidence was sufficient that he was not embarrassed.It was his house, after all. He didn\u2019t even recognize Celestine as his stepbrother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e; he did not move in those social circles, and he knew her name, but not her appearance.As master of the house, he received reports of every visitor. Today, there had been no message that visitors had requested to call. Therefore, this woman was not paying a formal visit, which meant he could consider her an intruder.His eyes sharpened.\u201cAh, it seems someone else is here,\u201d he said dryly, one eyebrow lifting. \u201cExcuse me.\u201dThere was no apology in his voice, and Celestine\u2019s eyes narrowed. How could any man speak like that and call himself a gentleman? At a single glance, she didn\u2019t like him. He was a handsome man with an outstanding physique, and a proud, confident bearing, but despite those good looks, he was bad-tempered and disagreeable. He was like beautiful poison ivy. She could see at once how difficult Annette\u2019s life had been, since she married such a man.Which explains that look on her face.Celestine hadn\u2019t missed Annette\u2019s bland smile when she had asked how her husband treated her. Even before a visitor and a lady, his manner was offensive. How much worse must it be in private?In return, Raphael met her defiant expression with instant antagonism. How dare this woman take that attitude in his house?More, she was forcing Annette to welcome her as a visitor, even when Annette was ill. Raphael\u2019s displeasure at Celestine\u2019s presence deepened. He did not understand how the unannounced visitor could sit conversing so calmly without noticing the flush of fever in Annette\u2019s cheeks.Inconsiderate woman.The hostility in their glances almost cast off visible sparks, and Annette was sitting directly between them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
