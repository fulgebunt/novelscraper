    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 1: I'm Bai XiaochunPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMount Hood lay in the Eastwood Mountain Range, and at its base was a quaint little village. The villagers there lived off the land, and didn\u2019t have much to do with the outside world.Currently it was dawn, and the villagers were congregated at the village gate to see off a young man of fifteen or sixteen years of age. He seemed thin and weak, but had a healthy, fair complexion, and an overall charming appearance. He wore an ordinary green robe that had apparently been washed so many times it was nearly worn through. Something about the way he was dressed, plus the innocent look in his eyes, made him seem exceptionally quick-witted.His name was Bai Xiaochun.\u201cDear elders and fellow villagers,\u201d he said, \u201cI am on my way to learn about immortal cultivation. I shall miss all of you!\u201d The young man wore a slightly pained expression, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to part with his fellow villagers. This made him look even more charming than before.The surrounding villagers exchanged glances, shrugged helplessly, and then pretended to look even more reluctant to see him leave.A white-haired old man stepped out of the crowd and said, \u201cXiaochun, ever since your dad and mom left us, oh so long ago, you... you have been, er--\u201d he paused for a moment \u201c--such a good kid!!\u201d Seeing that Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t left yet, he continued, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not interested in living forever? All you have to do is become an immortal, and then you can live forever! That\u2019s a really, really long time! Well, it\u2019s time for you to leave now. Even a baby eagle must learn to fly eventually. No matter what situations you run into out there, you have to hang in there and keep moving forward. Once you leave the village, you can't come back, because your path will always lie ahead, not behind!\u201dThe old man patted Bai Xiaochun kindly on the shoulder.\u201cLive forever....\u201d Bai Xiaochun murmured. A tremor ran through him, and a look of determination slowly filled his eyes. Under the encouraging gazes of the old man and the other villagers, he nodded his head seriously and looked around at everyone one last time. Finally, he turned and walked away from the village.As he disappeared off into the distance, the villagers started to look more and more excited. Their forlorn expressions turned to those of joy, and the kind-faced old man began to tremble. Tears even streamed down his face.\u201cJustice from the heavens! The weasel... is finally gone! Who was it that told him they saw an immortal in the area? Whoever it was, I'm going to give you a huge reward on behalf of the village!\u201dThe village was soon echoing with cries of rejoicing. Some people even took out gongs and drums and began banging them excitedly.\u201cThe weasel is gone,\u201d someone said, \u201cbut oh, my poor chickens. He hated the roosters crowing at dawn, so he somehow got all the kids in the village to eat every chicken we had....\u201d\u201cToday is the beginning of a new era!\u201dBy this point, Bai Xiaochun was still fairly close to the village, and could actually hear the sounds of the gongs and drums. He even caught wind of some of the cries of excitement.He stopped in his tracks, a strange expression on his face. After a moment, he cleared his throat and proceeded on his way. Accompanied by the faint sounds of rejoicing, he began to make his way toward Mount Hood.Mount Hood wasn\u2019t a very tall mountain, but it was covered with thick vegetation. Therefore, despite the fact that it was dawn, beneath the trees, it was dark and quiet.\u201cDouble-Dog told me that he was hunting some wild pigs a few days ago and saw an immortal flying around....\u201d Bai Xiaochun proceeded along, heart thumping. Suddenly, a rustling sound could be heard from some nearby shrubs. It almost sounded like a wild pig, and it immediately caused Bai Xiaochun to grow extremely nervous. The hair on the back of his neck stood up straight as he asked, \u201cWho is it? Who\u2019s there?!\u201dHe quickly pulled four axes and six machetes out of his travel pack, but that in and of itself didn't make him feel much safer, so he also produced a bit of black incense from within his robe, which he clutched tightly in his left hand.\u201cDon\u2019t come out!\u201d he shouted, trembling. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about coming out! I've got axes and machetes, and this incense can call lightning from the heavens, and even summon immortals! If you dare to show your face, you're dead!\u201d Finally, he turned and ran toward the mountain path, simultaneously juggling all of the various weapons in his hands. Clanking sounds could eventually be heard as axes and machetes began to fall to the ground left and right.Perhaps whatever it was that had been rustling around in the shrubbery really did end up getting frightened by him. The sounds ceased, and no wild animal burst out of the bushes. Bai Xiaochun hurried toward the mountain, wiping the sweat from his brow. By this point, his face was pale, and he was almost considering giving up this crazy idea of climbing the mountain, but then he thought about the incense stick, which his parents had handed down to him before they died. Supposedly, it had been passed down from their ancestors, a gift bestowed by a down-and-out immortal they had saved. Before departing, the immortal had given it to them to pay back the kindness they had shown. Furthermore, the immortal had even promised to take a member of the Bai Clan as a disciple. He told them that merely burning the incense stick would summon him to their side.Bai Xiaochun had actually lit the incense stick more than ten times in the past few years, and yet, no immortal had ever shown up. It had eventually reached the point that Bai Xiaochun was starting to suspect whether or not the story about the immortal was even true. Finally, he\u2019d resolved to climb the mountain. For one thing, the incense stick was almost used up, and also, there was the matter of the flying immortal being sighted recently.And that was how he ended up in his current situation. His theory was that if he could get a bit closer to the immortal, then perhaps it would be easier for that immortal to sense the incense stick.Standing in front of the mountain, he hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth and decided to keep going. Thankfully, the mountain wasn\u2019t very high, and it didn't take long to reach the peak, where he stopped, panting. He looked at the village down below, and an emotional expression appeared on his face. Then he glanced at the finger-nail sized bit of black incense. It had clearly been burned on numerous occasions, and was almost completely used up.\u201cIt\u2019s been three years. Bless me, mom and dad. It has to work this time!\u201d Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, and then carefully lit the incense. A stiff breeze instantly kicked up, and in the blink of an eye, dark clouds filled the sky. Lightning crackled, and deafening thunder boomed in his ears.The majesty of the entire scene caused Bai Xiaochun to tremble, fearful that he might be killed by the lightning. He very nearly spit on the incense to extinguish it, but managed to hold back.\u201cI've lit this incense twelve times in the past three years, and this is the thirteenth time. I have to let it burn! Come on, Xiaochun! The lightning won\u2019t kill you. At least probably not....\u201d All twelve times that he had lit the incense in the past, there had been lightning and thunder, and yet no immortal had ever appeared. Each time, he had gotten so scared that he spit on the incense to put it out. He actually found it a bit strange that a supposedly immortal stick of incense could be extinguished with some ordinary saliva.Bai Xiaochun sat there shaking in fear as the thunder boomed around him. Suddenly, a streak of light appeared in the air off in the distance.It was a middle-aged man wearing luxurious clothing. He had the demeanor of a transcendent being, yet he looked weary and travel-worn. In fact, if you looked closely, his eyes seemed to flicker with extreme exhaustion.\u201cFinally I can see exactly what moron has been lighting that incense stick all the time for the past three years!\u201dEvery time the man thought about what he had experienced during the past few years, he got extremely annoyed. Three years ago, he had sensed the medicinal aura of an incense stick he had given away back when he was in the Qi Condensation stage. That immediately caused him to recall the debt he owed back in the mortal world.The first time he flew out in response to the incense stick being lit, he had assumed it would be a simple matter of heading out and then immediately returning. He had never imagined that before even being able to find the incense, its aura would suddenly vanish, severing his connection to it. If it had happened only once, it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal. However, over the course of three years, the aura had appeared more than ten times.Over and over again his search was interrupted, ensuring that he was constantly leaving his sect and then going back. Back and forth, back and forth. It was torment.As he closed in on Mount Hood, he caught sight of Bai Xiaochun. Fuming with numerous frustrations, the man landed on the mountain top and waved his hand, instantly extinguishing the sputtering incense stick.The thunder ceased, and Bai Xiaochun stared at the man in shock.\u201cAre you an immortal?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked cautiously. Still unsure about what exactly was going on, he slipped his hand behind his back and grabbed an axe.\u201cYou may call me Li Qinghou. Are you from the Bai Clan?\u201d The middle-aged cultivator\u2019s eyes shone like lightning as he measured up Bai Xiaochun, ignoring the axe behind his back. To him, Bai Xiaochun seemed delicate, almost pretty, and reminded him of his old friend from years ago. Furthermore, his latent talent seemed suitable. Li Qinghou\u2019s anger gradually began to fade.Bai Xiaochun blinked a few times. Although he was still a bit scared, he sat up straight and quietly said, \u201cJunior most definitely is from the Bai Clan. I'm Bai Xiaochun.\u201d\u201cAlright, well tell me this,\u201d Li Qinghou said, his voice cool. \u201cWhy did you light that incense so many times over the past three years!?\u201d He very much wanted to know the answer to this question.As soon as Bai Xiaochun heard the question, his mind spun as he tried to come up with a good answer. Finally, a melancholic expression appeared on his face, and he looked down toward the village at the bottom of the mountain.\u201cJunior is a sentimental and righteous person,\u201d he said. \u201cI simply couldn\u2019t bear to part with my fellow villagers. Every time I lit the incense, I was overwhelmed with feelings of sorrow. The mere thought of leaving them behind was far too painful.\u201dLi Qinghou stared in shock. He had never considered such a possibility, and as such, the anger in his heart faded even more. He could tell from this young man\u2019s words alone that he was definitely good material.However, the next thing he did was send his divine sense down toward the village, and he heard the sounds of drums and gongs and rejoicing. He even heard the villagers talking about how glad they were that \u2018the weasel\u2019 was gone. An unsightly expression appeared on his face, and he felt a headache coming on. He looked back at the charming and pure Bai Xiaochun, who seemed like he wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly, and suddenly realized that this kid was a villain to the core.\u201cTell me the truth!\u201d Li Qinghou said, his voice echoing like thunder. Bai Xiaochun was so frightened that he started shaking.\u201cHey, you can\u2019t blame me!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, sounding very miserable. \u201cWhat kind of crappy incense is this anyway!? Every time I lit it, lightning would start crashing around everywhere! I almost got killed on several occasions! In fact, avoiding that lightning thirteen times was quite a feat!\u201dLi Qinghou looked silently at Bai Xiaochun.\u201cIf you were so scared, then why did you light it over ten times?!\u201d he asked.\u201c\u2019Cuz I'm scared of dying!\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied indignantly. \u201cIsn\u2019t the point of immortal cultivation to be able to live forever? I want to live forever!\u201dLi Qinghou was once again struck speechless. However, he found the kid\u2019s fascination with living forever laudable, and realized that his personality might change a bit after some hard training in the sect.After a moment of thought, he waved his sleeve, sweeping Bai Xiaochun up into a beam of light that shot off into the distance.\u201cAlright, come with me,\u201d he said.\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d asked Bai Xiaochun, suddenly realizing that they were flying. \u201cAh, we're so high....\u201d The ground was very, very far down, causing the blood to drain from his face. He immediately dropped his axe and grabbed onto the Immortal\u2019s leg.Li Qinghou looked down at him clutching his leg. Feeling a bit at a loss, he replied, \u201cThe Spirit Stream Sect.\u201d1.

    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 2: The OvensPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2: The OvensThe Spirit Stream Sect was located in the Eastwood Continent on the lower branch of the Heavenspan River, and was divided between the northern and southern banks. Its history stretched back countless years, and was very famous in the area.Eight enormous cloud-wreathed mountains towered over the Heavenspan River. Four of those mountains were located on the north bank of the river, whereas three were on the south bank. Shockingly, one mountain, the most majestic of them all, rose up from the middle of the river itself.The entire top half of that mountain was covered with brilliant white snow, and rose up so high that the peak of the mountain wasn\u2019t even visible. The middle of the mountain had been hollowed out, allowing the golden river water to flow right through it, and causing the mountain itself to somewhat resemble a bridge.Currently, a beam of light was speeding along near the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect. It was none other than Li Qinghou and Bai Xiaochun. As they raced into the servants\u2019 quarters beneath the third peak, it was just possible to hear Bai Xiaochun shouting out in fear.He was scared to death from all the flying. They had passed over countless mountains, and the entire time, he had felt like he was losing his grip on Li Qinghou\u2019s leg.Eventually, everything turned into a blur. When everything finally became clear again, he realized that they had landed just outside of a building. He stood there, legs trembling, looking around at a scene that was very different from what he was used to back at the village.Towering up in front of the building was a huge stone, upon which three characters were written in flamboyant calligraphy.Department of Servant Affairs.Sitting next to the stone was a pock-faced woman. As soon as she caught sight of Li Qinghou, she rose to her feet and clasped hands in greeting.\u201cSend this kid to the Ovens,\u201d Li Qinghou said. Without another word, and paying no further heed to Bai Xiaochun, he then transformed into a beam of light that shot off into the distance.When the pock-faced woman heard him mention the Ovens, she stared in shock. She looked Bai Xiaochun over, then handed him a bag which contained a servant\u2019s uniform and other items. Face expressionless, led him away from the building toward a nearby path, simultaneously explaining some of the basic sect rules and customs. The path was paved with green limestone, and wound through numerous buildings and courtyards. The fragrant aroma of plants and flowers filled the air, and the entire place seemed like a celestial paradise. As he looked around, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart began to thump with excitement, and his previous nervousness and anxiety began to fade.\u201cThis place is awesome,\u201d he thought. \u201cIt\u2019s way better than the village!\u201d His eyes shone with anticipation as he followed the woman along. The scenery only continued to get more and more spectacular. He even saw some beautiful women along the way, which instantly caused his heart to surge with delight.Soon, Bai Xiaochun got even more excited. That was because he caught sight of what appeared to be their destination; at the end of the path was a seven-story building that sparkled like crystal. There were even celestial cranes soaring in the air above it.\u201cAre we there yet, Elder Sister?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked excitedly.\u201cYes,\u201d she replied coolly, her face as expressionless as ever. She pointed to a small path off to the side. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re going.\u201dBai Xiaochun looked in the direction she was pointing, heart bursting with anticipation. But then, his entire body went stiff, and he rubbed his eyes. He looked again, a bit more closely, and saw a gravel path lined by haphazardly-constructed thatch-roofed huts that looked like they might disintegrate at any moment. A strange aroma wafted out from the area.Bai Xiaochun wanted to cry, but no tears would come. Still clinging to a scrap of hope, he asked the pock-faced woman another question.\u201cElder Sister, did you point in the wrong direction just now?\u201d\u201cNope,\u201d she replied coolly, stepping onto the gravel path. When Bai Xiaochun heard her response, all of the beauty of the place seemed to disappear. A bitter expression appeared on his face as he continued to follow her.Before long, he caught sight of the end of the decrepit path, where he saw several huge black woks running around. After a moment, he realized that the woks were actually attached to the backs of several incredibly fat men. These men were so obese that it seemed like squeezing them would cause pure fat to ooze out. One of the men was even fatter than the others, so fat that he looked like a mountain of flesh. Bai Xiaochun was even worried that the man might explode from being so fat. 1The entire area was filled with hundreds of huge cooking woks, within which fat men were boiling rice.Sensing that someone had approached, the men looked up and saw the pock-faced woman. The fattest of the men, the one who looked like a mountain of flesh, hefted his ladle and hurried over. The ground trembled as he walked, and his fat bounced and jiggled in a way that made Bai Xiaochun stare in shock. Without even thinking about it, he began to feel around for an axe.\u201cThe magpies were singing especially beautiful songs this morning, and now I know why,\u201d the mountain of flesh cried out as he ran over. His eyes flickered with a lustful gleam. \u201cIt was all because you were coming, big sis. Could it be that you\u2019ve changed your mind? You finally realized how talented I am, and want to take advantage of this auspicious day to formally become my beloved partner?\u201dThe pock-faced woman looked at the mountain of flesh with both disgust and anger.\u201cI\u2019m just here to deliver this kid to the Ovens,\u201d she said. \u201cTask accomplished. I\u2019ll take my leave now!\u201d Then she hurried off.Bai Xiaochun gasped. He had taken the time to check out the woman on their way here, and she really looked like a freak. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder what kind of taste this fat man had. Apparently even someone with a face like hers got him all hot and bothered.Before Bai Xiaochun could consider the matter any more, the mountain of flesh was suddenly standing in front of him, panting a bit. The man was so huge that Bai Xiaochun found himself completely covered by his shadow.Bai Xiaochun looked up at the enormous man and his quivering rolls of flesh, and swallowed hard. This was actually his first time ever seeing someone so fat.The mountain of flesh glanced resentfully at the pock-faced woman, who was making her way back up the gravel path, then looked back at Bai Xiaochun.\u201cWell well, we have a newcomer. We\u2019d left a spot open for Xu Baocai to join, so this complicates matters.\u201dBai Xiaochun felt nervous just looking at the man\u2019s huge frame, and subconsciously took a few steps back. \u201cElder Brother, I am your humble\u2026 er, humble servant Bai Xiaochun\u2026.\u201d\u201cBai Xiaochun? Hmm\u2026. White skin, slender and dainty. You look pretty innocent. Excellent, excellent. Your name really fits my taste.\u201d The mountain of flesh looked him over, then clapped Bai Xiaochun on the shoulder, which very nearly sent Bai Xiaochun flying off to the side.\u201cUh, what\u2019s your name, Elder Brother?\u201d Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and looked up thoughtfully as he prepared to make fun of the man\u2019s name.The mountain of flesh chuckled and slapped his chest, causing the fat to ripple back and forth. \u201cI\u2019m Big Fatty Zhang. That\u2019s Second Fatty Huang, and that\u2019s Third Fatty Hei\u2026\u201dAs soon as Bai Xiaochun heard these incredibly stirring names, he abandoned any plans to make fun of them.\u201cAs for you,\u201d Big Fatty Zhang continued, \u201cfrom now on, you\u2019ll be Ninth Fatty Bai! Er\u2026. Wait a second, Junior Brother. You\u2019re way too skinny! If you go around looking like that, you\u2019ll lose face for the Ovens! Well, I guess that doesn\u2019t matter for now. Don\u2019t worry. After a few years, you\u2019ll get fat too. Then we\u2019ll call you Ninth Fatty Bai.\u201dWhen Bai Xiaochun heard the nickname Ninth Fatty Bai, he grimaced.\u201cWell, since you\u2019re already our Ninth Junior Brother, you don\u2019t count as an outsider any more. Here in the Ovens, we have a long-standing tradition of carrying woks on our backs. See this wok here on my back?\u201d He slapped the wok and continued boastfully: \u201cIt\u2019s the king of woks, forged from the highest quality iron and engraved with an Earth Flame spell formation. When you use this wok to cook up spirit rice, the flavor is far, far better than the rice cooked in any other wok. By the way, you\u2019ll have to choose a wok to carry on your back, too. Then you\u2019ll look really impressive.\u201dGlancing at Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s wok, and realizing that everyone else in the Ovens was similarly adorned, Bai Xiaochun suddenly got an image of himself walking around in such a fashion.\u201cElder Brother,\u201d he blurted, \u201cis it possible to opt out of the wok-carrying thing\u2026?\u201d\u201cAre you kidding me? Wok-carrying is an important tradition in the Ovens! Later on when you\u2019re out in the sect, people will see the wok on your back and instantly recognize that you\u2019re from the Ovens! Once they know that, they won\u2019t dare to pick on you. The Ovens has a lot of influence around here, you know!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang winked at Bai Xiaochun. Allowing no further discussion of the matter, he led Bai Xiaochun to one of the thatch-roofed huts, within which were stacks of thousands of woks, most of which were covered in layers of dust. Clearly, no one had been in here for quite some time.\u201cGo ahead and pick one, Ninth Junior Brother, then come on over and help tend to the rice. If the rice burns, then the Outer Sect disciples will make a scene again.\u201d Letting out a holler, Big Fatty Zhang turned and ran back to join the other fat men as they hustled and bustled amongst the more than one hundred cooking woks.Sighing in despair, Bai Xiaochun looked over the woks, and was agonizing over which one to pick when he suddenly noticed one particular wok off in the corner, buried under a big pile.It was a unique wok that, instead of being circular, was shaped like an oval. It almost didn\u2019t even look like an oval, but rather, like a turtle shell. There were also some faint markings visible on its surface.\u201cEee?\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes brightened, and he quickly walked over and squatted down to look at the wok more closely. After dragging it out and examining it further, his eyes began to shine with satisfaction.He had been fond of turtles ever since he was young, mostly because they represented longevity. Considering that he had come to learn about Immortal cultivation for the purposes of living forever, as soon as his saw the turtle-shell wok, he knew that it was an auspicious sign, a good omen.After he emerged with the wok, Big Fatty Zhang caught sight of him and hurried over, ladle in hand.\u201cNinth Junior Brother, why did you pick that one?\u201d he asked sincerely, rubbing his ample belly. \u201cThat wok has been in there for years, and nobody has ever used it, mainly because it looks like a turtle shell and people don\u2019t want to put it on their backs. Umm\u2026 are you sure, Ninth Junior Brother?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d Bai Xiaochun said resolutely, looking fondly at the wok. \u201cThis is the wok for me.\u201dBig Fatty Zhang tried to dissuade him some more, but eventually realized that Bai Xiaochun had made up his mind. Finally, he gave him a strange look and stopped trying. After assigning him one of the Ovens\u2019 thatch-roofed huts for housing, he went back to work.Soon, dusk had fallen. Bai Xiaochun sat in his thatch-roofed hut, examining the turtle-shaped wok. One thing that stuck out to him were the designs traced on the back of the wok, which were so faint that you wouldn\u2019t see them unless you looked closely.He could instantly tell that this was no ordinary wok. Carefully putting it on the stove, he looked around the little hut. It was very simple. In addition to the stove, it had a bed, a desk, and an ordinary copper mirror hanging on the wall. As Bai Xiaochun had his head turned to look around, the seemingly-ordinary wok behind him suddenly emitted a flash of violet light!As far as Bai Xiaochun was concerned, this had been a day packed with all sorts of momentous events. He had finally arrived in the land of his dreams, a world of Immortals. At the moment, he was still in a bit of a daze.After a bit of time passed, he took a deep breath, and his eyes began to shine with anticipation.\u201cI\u2019m gonna live forever!\u201d As he sat there, he pulled out the bag which the pock-faced woman had given him.Inside the bag was a medicinal pill, a wooden sword, some incense, a servant\u2019s uniform, and a command medallion. Finally, there was a bamboo scroll with several small characters written on the cover.\u201cViolet Qi Cauldron Control Art. Qi Condensation Manual.\u201dIt was evening, and Big Fatty Zhang and the others in the Ovens were bustling about. Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun was looking at the bamboo scroll, eyes shining with anticipation. He had come here in order to learn how to live forever, and he held the key to achieving that goal in his hands right now. After taking a deep breath, he opened the scroll.Moments later, his eyes were gleaming with excitement. The bamboo scroll had three pictures, and accompanying text that described how cultivation was divided into two stages of Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment. As far as the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art, it was divided into ten levels, each of which corresponded to the ten levels of Qi Condensation.By practicing cultivation to a given level, it was possible to exercise control over physical objects. After reaching the third level, you could control half of a small cauldron. At the sixth level, it became half of a large cauldron. At the ninth level, it was a full cauldron. As for the final full circle, you could actually control two full cauldrons.Unfortunately, this scroll only described up to the third level of the art, with no further information about the subsequent levels. The key to the whole thing was cultivation, using a prescribed set of breathing techniques to develop the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art.Bai Xiaochun cleared his mind and began to regulate his breathing. Then he closed his eyes and imitated the posture depicted in the first picture in the bamboo scroll. He was able to hold on for three breaths of time before intense pain filled him. Finally, he let out a shout and gave up. From what he could tell, using this breathing technique actually sucked all the air out of him, making it impossible to actually breathe.\u201cThis is way too hard,\u201d he thought. \u201cAccording to the description under the picture, when you practice this kind of cultivation, you should be able to sense a strand of qi flowing through you. Just now, though, the only thing I felt was intense pain.\u201d He was starting to get frustrated. However, for the sake of living forever, he gritted his teeth and tried again. He repeated the process over and over again until it was the middle of the night. During that entire time, he never once sensed any sort of qi in his body.He had no way of knowing it, but even someone with exceptional latent talent who tried to cultivate the first level of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art would need at least a month to succeed, unless they had some outside help. Considering that, it was simply impossible that he could have succeeded after only a few hours.Body aching painfully, Bai Xiaochun finally stretched, and was about to go wash his face when, all of a sudden, he heard a commotion outside. He stuck his head out of the window and immediately caught sight of a sallow-faced young man standing in the door of the main courtyard of the Ovens. He looked angry.\u201cI\u2019m Xu Baocai! Whoever it was that took my spot here, get the hell out here right now!\u201d\u2014\u2013Note from Deathblade: Not everyone has read other versions of this translation, so please keep spoiler information out of the comments.1. This situation is pretty funny because \u201cto carry a black wok on the back\u201d is an expression which means \u201cto be made a scapegoat\u201d or \u201cbe unjustly blamed.\u201d Here\u2019s a little clipart (http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/c83d70cf3bc79f3d47ed2dc9bca1cd11728b293f.jpg) I found on the Chinese internet that depicts the phrasePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Enraged, he yelled, \u201cSo, you\u2019re the guy who took my spot!\u201dIt was too late for Bai Xiaochun to duck his head back into the window. He immediately pasted an innocent expression onto his face and said, \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t me!\u201d\u201cLiar! You\u2019re so skinny and short, you\u2019re obviously a newbie here!\u201d Xu Baocai clenched his hands into fists and stared furiously at Bai Xiaochun. He was so angry that he looked like he might explode at any moment.Feeling quite wronged, Bai Xiaochun peeped: \u201cIt really had nothing to do with me!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care! Three days from now on the southern slope of the sect, you and I are gonna have a fight to the death! If you win, then I\u2019ll have no choice other than to suck it up. If you lose, then I get my spot back.\u201d Xu Baocai shoved his hand into his robe and pulled out a Blood Notice, which he threw onto Bai Xiaochun\u2019s window sill. The notice was covered with countless versions of the character \u201cDIE,\u201d all of them written in blood.Bai Xiaochun looked down at all the \u201cDIE\u201d characters and couldn\u2019t miss the killing intent roiling off of them. His heart went cold. Then he remembered that Xu Baocai had just mentioned a \u2018fight to the death,\u2019 and he gasped.\u201cElder Brother, this isn\u2019t that big a deal! Why did you have to go and use your own blood to write so many characters? Didn\u2019t it\u2026 hurt?\u201d\u201cNot a big deal?!\u201d Xu Baocai roared, gnashing his teeth. \u201cHumph! I\u2019ve been living frugally for ages. I saved up spirit stones for seven years! Seven years, do you hear me!?!? Only then could I afford to bribe the Honor Guard into getting me a spot in the Ovens! Then you decide to stick your foot into the door? This enmity will never be reconciled! Three days from now is the day you die!\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, picking up the Blood Notice gingerly between his thumb and forefinger, and then tossing it out the window.\u201cYOU!\u201d raged Xu Baocai. Suddenly, he felt the ground shaking, and he realized that there was a mountain of flesh standing there next to him. It was hard to say how long Big Fatty Zhang had been standing there, but there he was, off to the side, coldly measuring up Xu Baocai.\u201cNinth Fatty,\u201d he said, addressing Bai Xiaochun, \u201cyou\u2019re on dish duty with Second Brother.\u201d Then he looked back at Xu Baocai. \u201cAs for you, stop causing such a ruckus! Get your ass out of here!\u201d He swept his ladle through the air threateningly, causing a gust of wind to spring up.Xu Baocai\u2019s face fell, and he backed up several steps. He wanted to keep arguing, but seeing the impatient look on Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s face, he shot a venomous look at Bai Xiaochun, then stalked off.As Bai Xiaochun thought about it, he realized that considering the vicious look Xu Baocai had given him, he was certain to pop up again at some point. Therefore, the best thing to do in this situation would be to stay put in the Ovens. Most likely, Xu Baocai wouldn\u2019t dare to come back there and cause trouble.Days passed. Bai Xiaochun slowly got used to working in the Ovens during the day, and cultivating the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art at night. However, progress was slow. Eventually he got to the point where he could endure for four breaths of time, but no more, leaving him very frustrated.On one particular night in the middle of his cultivation session, he suddenly heard a big commotion among the fat Elder Brothers.\u201cClose the gate, close the gate! Hurry up, Second Fatty Huang, close that gate!\u201d\u201cThird Fatty Hei, check and see if anyone is spying on us. Quickly!\u201dBai Xiaochun blinked in shock. Having learned from his previous mistake, he avoided the window and peeked through a crack in the door. What he saw was a bunch of fatties bustling around the courtyard so fast they were almost flying.Moments later, the main gate to the Ovens was closed tightly. Furthermore, for some reason, a faint mist had sprung up, making the fatties look even more mysterious than ever.Bai Xiaochun watched the scene playing out. The fatties were now hustling over to one particular thatched hut. Despite all the mist, Bai Xiaochun could clearly see Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s formidable frame, and he seemed to be speaking to the others. The whole scene was very odd, so Bai Xiaochun began to edge away from the door in an attempt to pretend he hadn\u2019t seen anything at all.However, it was at that exact point that Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s voice echoed out: \u201cNinth Fatty, I know you\u2019re watching. Get out here!\u201d Although he didn\u2019t speak very loud, his voice instantly weighed down on Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun blinked a few times, then slowly walked out the door, putting on the innocent expression of a person who wasn\u2019t capable of even hurting a fly.As soon as he neared the group of fatties, Big Fatty Zhang grabbed him and pulled him over to stand among them. Almost immediately, Bai Xiaochun caught a whiff of some unique aroma, something that instantly caused a warm feeling to spread throughout his body.He looked around at the others, and saw that they all had euphoric expressions on their faces. For some reason, he also felt enlivened. It was then that he noticed that Big Fatty Zhang was holding a magical mushroom in his hand. It was about the size of an infant\u2019s hand, and as translucent as crystal; all it took was a single glance, and anyone could tell that it was no ordinary item.Big Fatty Zhang looked over at Bai Xiaochun, then held out the mushroom and gruffly said, \u201cCome on, Ninth Junior Brother, take a bite.\u201d\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d replied Bai Xiaochun, eying the magical mushroom. Then he looked around at all the fat Elder Brothers, and hesitated. Big Fatty Zhang instantly got irritated. From the look on his face, if Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t eat the mushroom, the two of them would become enemies.It wasn\u2019t just him. Second Fatty Huang, Third Fatty Hei, and all the others were all glaring at Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun swallowed hard. Even in his wildest dreams, he would never have imagined himself in a situation where people would flip out in anger if he didn\u2019t take a bite of a priceless magical mushroom, as if it were nothing more than a chicken leg. And yet, that was exactly what was happening right in front of his very eyes.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart was thumping as he gritted his teeth and accepted the magical mushroom. Finally, he opened his mouth and took a big bite. The mushroom instantly dissolved in his mouth, causing a wonderful sensation to fill his body, something many times more intense than what he had experienced moments before when merely smelling it. Almost instantly, his face flushed bright red.\u201cExcellent. Elder Sun demanded that we use this hundred-year-old magical mushroom in a soup. If we all take a bite, then we\u2019ll have to sink or swim together!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang looked extremely content as he opened his mouth and took a nibble. Then he tossed the mushroom to the next fatty in line, and soon, all of them were munching on mushroom flesh. Now that they were all chewing together, the group smiled at Bai Xiaochun as if he were now one of them.Bai Xiaochun chuckled as he realized that all these guys were essentially partners in crime. Furthermore, considering they had gotten so fat this way, it probably wasn\u2019t dangerous to join them. It was little wonder Xu Baocai had given him a duel challenge with the word \u201cDIE\u201d written on it so many times\u2026.\u201cElder Brother,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, \u201cthat magical mushroom was scrumptious! I feel like my whole body\u2019s on fire!\u201d He licked his lips and looked impatiently at Big Fatty Zhang.In response, Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s eyes began to shine brightly. With a hearty laugh, he flamboyantly pulled out a sealwort flower, which he handed to Bai Xiaochun.\u201cNow do you see how amazing the Ovens is, Junior Brother? I wasn\u2019t lying! Alright, eat up. Eat till you\u2019re stuffed!\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes began to shine as he took a big bite. Next, Big Fatty Zhang pulled out some sort of natural precious material, something that looked like a golden jewel, which emanated a fragrant aroma.Bai Xiaochun needed no prompting from Big Fatty Zhang. He immediately took a bite and swallowed it down. The tangy flavor filled him with a wonderful sensation. After that, Big Fatty Zhang produced an incredibly sweet red spirit fruit.More items emerged. Magical mushrooms, various medicinal ingredients, spirit fruits and other precious items. Bai Xiaochun partook of them all, as did the other fatties. He ate so much that soon, his head was spinning. He almost felt drunk, his body hot and burning to the point where white steam rose up from the top of his head. He already felt as fat as a ball.The more he ate, the more kindly Big Fatty Zhang and the others looked at him. In the end, they slapped their stomachs and laughed heartily, and they all truly seemed like partners in crime.Head swimming, Bai Xiaochun stretched out his arms and legs. His hand landed on Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s giant stomach, and his foot landed off to the side. He began to laugh along with the others.\u201cOther servant departments would kill to get one of their own into the Outer Sect. But we kill to make sure we stay out! Who wants to go there anyway? What\u2019s so good about the Outer Sect, huh?\u201d Big Fatty Zhang sounded very proud of this. As he finished speaking, he pulled out a ginseng root. The root itself had countless faintly visible age rings, and was covered with numerous rootlets. Clearly, this ginseng root was very old.\u201cNinth Junior Brother, our cultivation bases are all strong enough that we could have become Outer Sect disciples a long time ago. However, we prefer to hide our true level. Look, there are Outer Sect disciples who would kill for the chance to get a single bite of a one-hundred-year-old ginseng root like this. Do we look scared?\u201d Big Fatty Zhang subsequently plucked a rootlet off and popped it into his mouth, chewed, and swallowed. Then he handed the ginseng root to Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun was so stuffed he almost couldn\u2019t see straight. \u201cElder Brother, I\u2019m full\u2026. I really can\u2019t eat another bite\u2013\u201dBefore he could even finish speaking, Big Fatty Zhang plucked off a rootlet and stuffed it into his mouth.\u201cNinth Junior Brother, you\u2019re far too skinny, so skinny that the girls in the sect won\u2019t like you. In our sect, they like guys like us Brothers, stalwart and plump! Come on, eat\u2026.\u201d Big Fatty Zhang let out a huge burp. Then he picked up a stack of empty bowls, simultaneously pointing to two scrolls hanging on either side of the nearby thatched hut, upon which was written a couplet. \u201cLook, we have a saying here that goes I\u2019d rather starve to death in the Ovens than struggle up the ladder in the Outer Sect.\u201dBai Xiaochun looked over at the couplet and said, \u201cYeah, for sure! We all want to starve to death here! Uh\u2026 yeah, starve to death.\u201dThen he slapped his stomach and let out a burp.Hearing this, Big Fatty Zhang and the others all started laughing. They all were finding Bai Xiaochun to be increasingly charming.\u201cToday is a great day,\u201d Big Fatty Zhang said. \u201cNinth Junior Brother, I have something important to tell you. We have certain ways of doing things here in the Ovens, and to fit in, you need to memorize a certain mnemonic. Pay attention.

If you go about eating following these principles, then you\u2019re guaranteed to be safe. Alright, let\u2019s call it a night. Head to sleep everyone, today\u2019s midnight snack is over. The Outer Sect disciples are still waiting for their soup.\u201d As he spoke, Big Fatty Zhang began to fill the empty bowls with rice gruel.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s head was spinning, and he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the six lines of truth he had just been told. He looked over at Big Fatty Zhang and the others filling up the bowls, let out a burp, then squatted down to examine the bowls themselves. Then, his mouth turned up into a smile.\u201cElder Brothers, these bowls are too nice.\u201dBig Fatty Zhang and the others looked back at him with strange expressions.Looking as charming as ever, he chuckled and said, \u201cAt first glance, they don\u2019t look very big, but can actually hold a lot of food. Why don\u2019t we make them look big, but hold less food? For example, we could make the bottom of the bowls\u2026 thicker!\u201dBig Fatty Zhang stared in shock, as though he had just been struck by lightning. His rolls of fat then began to quiver, and his eyes began to shine brightly. The other fatties began to pant, and their fat also began to tremble.All of a sudden a loud smacking sound rang out as Big Fatty Zhang slapped his thigh. Then he threw his head back and laughed uproariously.\u201cYes, yes, YES! That\u2019s an idea worth passing down! Future generations in the Ovens will all benefit from this! Ninth Junior Brother, I never imagined that someone as charming as you would actually be as crafty as this! Hahaha! You were born to be a part of the Ovens!\u201d1. Thanks to anonpuffs for helping out with these six lines.

Not only was he very charming, he seemed to have lots of crafty ideas. Big Fatty Zhang decided that a reward was in order, and pressed a grain of spirit rice into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand.Bai Xiaochun laughed happily as he staggered back to his room. Before he could climb in bed, all of the spiritual energy he had absorbed by eating the various precious materials suddenly burst out inside of him. His head spun, and he flopped face-first down onto the ground, where he immediately began snoring.He slept wonderfully for the entire night. The following morning at dawn, when he opened his eyes, they shone brightly. He looked down to find that he was fatter than the day before. Furthermore, his skin was covered in a sticky layer of filth. When he hurried out to wash up, Big Fatty Zhang and the others were preparing breakfast for the sect disciples. When they saw Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bedraggled appearance, they started laughing.\u201cNinth Junior Brother, all that filth comes from the impurities in your body. Once you get rid of it, it will be much easier for you to practice cultivation. Take a few days off, we won\u2019t need your help anyway. In a few days you can start working again.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget about that grain of spirit rice! Eat it up quickly before it goes bad.\u201d\u201cSure thing,\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied. Feeling quite energetic, he returned to his room and grabbed the turtle-shaped wok off of the stove. After filling it with water from the washroom, he returned and put it back on the stove. Then he pulled out the grain of spirit rice to examine it. It was about the size of his thumb, crystalline in appearance, and fragrantly aromatic.\u201cIf Immortals eat this stuff, then it must be incredible.\u201d Sighing, he threw a few pieces of wood into the stove, then lit the fire. He was immediately hit by a blast of heat, which caused him to back up, blinking anxiously. Then he looked down at the fire and clicked his tongue.\u201cThat\u2019s no ordinary fire. It lights faster and also burns a lot hotter than the fire in the village.\u201d Taking another look at the burning logs in the fire, he realized that they were not ordinary pieces of wood.About this time, the fire began to burn even hotter than before, and Bai Xiaochun watched in amazement as one of the designs etched into the back of the turtle shell wok began to light up, starting at what appeared to be the tail of the turtle shell and ending where the head would be. Soon, the entire design was shining brightly.Bai Xiaochun stared in amazement, then slapped his thigh.\u201cI knew it! This is some sort of treasure! It\u2019s definitely way better than Eldest Brother\u2019s wok!\u201d More certain than ever that this wok was something extraordinary, Bai Xiaochun quickly tossed the grain of spirit rice into the water.Then he sat off to the side with the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art bamboo scroll. Emulating the movements and breathing techniques depicted in the first picture, he began to cultivate.He had only just begun when, suddenly, his eyes went wide; the posture which had been so difficult to maintain just the day before, was now much easier to assume. In fact, he actually felt very comfortable, without the slightest sensation of awkwardness. In addition, the breathing technique no longer left him feeling as if he were suffocating. Instead, he felt a very pleasant sensation.Furthermore, he was absolutely certain that before today he could only maintain the posture for about three or four breaths of time, but this time, after seven or eight breaths, he didn\u2019t feel the least bit of pain or discomfort.Suppressing his excitement, Bai Xiaochun calmly continued until thirty breaths of time had passed. Just when he was finally starting to feel weak and uncomfortable, a strand of qi suddenly appeared inside of him. It was very cold, and swirled around rapidly; before it could make a full circle through his body, it vanished. However, Bai Xiaochun was so excited he leapt to his feet.\u201cQi! Hahaha! Finally some qi appeared!\u201d Bursting with excitement, he began to pace back and forth in his room. He quickly came to the conclusion that it must have something to do with all the precious materials he had consumed the previous night. Suddenly he wished he had eaten more.\u201cNo wonder Elder Brother Zhang would rather starve to death in the Ovens than go climb the ladder in the Outer Sect. Not even the Outer Sect disciples would have opportunities like this.\u201d Sitting down anxiously, he once again began to practice cultivation.This time, he was able to maintain the posture and breathing for a full sixty breaths of time. At that point, a flow of qi appeared in him, almost a trickle, that rapidly circulated through his body.Having experienced this once before, he was ready, and began to guide the qi through a specific path, as indicated by the first picture in the bamboo scroll.Soon, the qi was flowing through him in just the way he wanted. He maintained the posture and movements indicated in the first illustration, and as he did, he could sense streams of coldness emerging from various parts of his body, almost like drops of water, which merged into the qi flow, causing it to grow larger and larger.In the end, it was like a tiny stream, flowing in a continuous cycle. A tremor ran through him, and it was as if a layer of fog had suddenly been stripped away from his mind. A rumbling sound echoed out from his body.He suddenly felt lighter and more agile than before. At the same time, globules of filth were expelled from the pores all over his body.Unlike last time, the stream of qi inside of him didn\u2019t vanish, but instead, remained there, circulating through his body. Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes, and they shone even more brightly than before. His mind even seemed to move a bit quicker and his body felt lighter and faster.\u201cA permanent qi vessel,\u201d he thought excitedly. \u201cThat\u2019s the sign that I\u2019ve successfully cultivated the first level of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art! It also means that I\u2019ve reached that\u2013what\u2019s it called\u2013first level of Qi Condensation!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was overjoyed, and immediately ran to the washroom.When Big Fatty Zhang and the others saw him, they exchanged knowing glances. Although they were a bit surprised that Bai Xiaochun had reached the first level so quickly, they all knew why it had happened.After returning to his room, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, and then began to study the bamboo scroll more thoroughly.\u201cAfter cultivating the first level of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art, I should be able to manipulate physical objects. Wow, this is basically an Immortal magical technique. I should be able to shoot things through the air.\u201d Eyes shining, he followed the instructions prescribed in the scroll, moving both hands together in a special way to perform an incantation. Then, he waved his finger at the nearby desk. Instantly, the stream inside of him surged like a bucking bronco, racing toward his right index finger and then out through the tip of his finger.It turned into something like an invisible thread, which then attached itself to the nearby desk. However, almost as soon as it reached the desk, the connection grew unstable, and the thread disintegrated.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face went pale. After a moment of recuperation, he reviewed what he had just done, then decided to give up on moving the desk. Instead, he pulled out the wooden sword from his bag and placed it on top of the desk. He wasn\u2019t sure what type of wood the sword was made from, but despite being much lighter than the desk, it still seemed unusually heavy. He waved his finger toward it, and the wooden sword twitched, then slowly floated an inch up into the air before falling back down onto the desk.Bai Xiaochun was anything but discouraged. After a few more excited attempts, he was able to get the sword to rise higher and higher. Soon it was ten inches, then twenty, then thirty\u2026. By the time dusk fell, he could get the wooden sword to fly in a straight line. Although it wasn\u2019t very fast, and he couldn\u2019t quite make it turn, it wouldn\u2019t fall down as easily as it had when he first started practicing.\u201cHenceforth, I, Bai Xiaochun, am an Immortal!\u201d He rose proudly to his feet, held his left hand behind his back, and then waved his right hand, causing the wooden sword to fly unsteadily back and forth in his room.Eventually, his qi began to grow unstable, so he put the wooden sword away and continued to practice cultivation. Later, he caught wind of a fragrant aroma coming from the wok, causing him to raise his head and take a deep sniff. Suddenly feeling ravenous, he realized that he had been busy cultivating all day, and had completely forgotten about the spirit rice boiling in the wok. He immediately walked over and lifted the lid to look inside.The moment he did, the strong, fragrant aroma of spirit rice wafted out. Furthermore, at some point during the process, a brilliant, glowing silver design had appeared on the surface of the rice!The design was clearly visible, and when Bai Xiaochun looked at it closely, he suddenly felt lost within the light. After a while, though, the design began to fade. He narrowed his eyes, and after some more thought, picked up the grain of spirit rice and held it in his hand for a closer look.\u201cThat design looks really familiar\u2026.\u201d His eyes flickered with a thoughtful gleam. He ducked his head to look under the stove, and saw that the fire had long since burned out. The pieces of wood were nothing more than ash now, and the design on the wok had once again faded into obscurity.However, he could still tell that the silver design on the grain of rice was the same design as the one on the back of the wok.He decided not to continue to investigate the design, and to be safe, chose not to eat the rice for the time being. Instead, he put it into his bag, sat there for a moment in contemplation, then left his hut to help Big Fatty Zhang and the others.Before long, half a month had passed. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation progress had once again slowed down. However, after some discreet inquiries, he learned that silver designs never appeared on spirit rice when it was cooked.His curiosity had definitely been piqued. The more he learned about it, the more it seemed that there was something special about this particular grain of rice, not to mention his wok, which seemed even stranger. A few days later, Third Fatty Hei left the Ovens to go purchase supplies, giving Bai Xiaochun the perfect opportunity to sneak into the Four Seas Room, a place where servants could get general information about cultivation.On his way back to his hut, he did his best to conceal the excitement which filled his heart. After closing the door behind him, he immediately took out the grain of spirit rice and studied the silver design. Gradually, an expression of disbelief appeared on his face.\u201cWhen Immortals practice cultivation, there are three skills they can\u2019t do without. The first is synthesizing medicines, the second is equipment forging, and the third is spirit enhancement!\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought back to the images he had dug up when searching through the ancient records in the Four Seas Room. One of them had closely resembled the silver design that was now visible on the grain of rice.\u201cSpirit enhancement!\u201d After a moment, he took a long, deep breath.Spirit enhancement was a special technique in which the energy of Heaven and Earth was forced into physical objects. It was a type of magic that essentially replaced the natural functions of Heaven and Earth, a technique which could be used on medicinal pills, incense, or magical items. Unfortunately, it was forbidden by Heaven and Earth, ensuring that the rate of success was limited. A success would lead to the item being vastly more powerful. A failure would result in the energy of Heaven and Earth rendering the item completely useless.The most shocking thing about spirit enhancement was that it could be performed over and over again. Every success increased the effects of the spirit enhancement by tenfold, leading to Heaven-shaking, Earth-toppling transformations.Of course, the more precious the item was to begin with, the more terrifying the results of success would be.Unsurprisingly, the chances of success decreased with each enhancement. In fact, after a certain point, even some spirit enhancement Grandmasters wouldn\u2019t dare to go any further. After all, the ramifications of a failure in that case would be difficult to accept.\u201cThe ancient records said that the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s guardian treasure is an item that was somehow enhanced ten times by spirit enhancement. The Heavenhorn Sword!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s throat felt dry. Eyes shining with disbelief and confusion, he swallowed and looked over at the turtle-shaped wok. There were ten faint decorative lines on the back of it, and when he looked at them, his heart began to beat so hard it felt like it was about to burst out of his chest.As of this moment, he was sure that the design which had appeared on the spirit rice was a mark of spirit enhancement. Furthermore, the source of that design was none other than his wok!After a moment of hesitation, he gritted his teeth. If he didn\u2019t get to the bottom of this mystery, he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep. He knew for a fact that this wok was something extraordinary, and therefore, he couldn\u2019t let anyone in on his secret.He waited until it was late in the night, then very quietly tip-toed over to the wok. After taking a deep breath and trying not to think about what would happen if he failed, he pulled out his wooden sword and threw it inside, the same way he had thrown the grain of rice in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bai Xiaochun looked thoughtfully at the patterns on the turtle-wok, and then looked down into the stove itself. Nothing remained of the wood but ash so he left, to return a few minutes later with some more firewood.Firewood for personal use wasn\u2019t very common in the Ovens, so he\u2019d been forced to go find Big Fatty Zhang to make a special request for some more.After kindling the fire, Bai Xiaochun once again focused on the first design on the turtle-wok. As the wood burned, the design lit up. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart began to thump with excitement, and then suddenly, the wooden sword began to shine with blinding silver light.He backed up a few paces, after which the light slowly faded away, and a piercing sensation began to emanate out from inside the wok.He took a deep breath and carefully sidled up to the wok. The wooden sword, just like the grain of spirit rice, now had a bright silver design on it, which gradually faded to a deep silver color!The sword appeared different than before. Although it was still made of wood, it now seemed more like it was made from metal. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes lit up as he carefully took the sword out of the wok. It felt heavier, and also emanated a certain coldness.\u201cIt worked! My first spirit enhancement on the wooden sword worked!\u201d Bai Xiaochun fondled the sword ecstatically, then glanced over at the wok and tried to decide what to do with it. In the end, he decided to just leave it where it was. The more he treated it like an ordinary item, the less likely it was that anyone would pay attention to it.As for the spirit rice, he decided to eat it bit by bit over time. He would also be careful to not let anyone see the wooden sword. As an added measure, he came up with the idea of somehow painting over the glowing design.Finally, he tidied his room, then walked out nonchalantly, as if nothing unusual had occurred. Over the next few days, he collected some various liquid materials from the Ovens which he used to paint the sword, making it bright and colorful, albeit somewhat unsightly. The most important thing was that the spirit design was covered up well enough that it wasn\u2019t obvious. In the end, Bai Xiaochun nodded his head in satisfaction.As the days passed, Bai Xiaochun became as comfortable with life in the Ovens as a fish in water. He quickly fit in with the other Elder Brothers, and also became familiar with the work that went on there. He soon found that different types of fire were necessary for cooking different spirit foods. In fact, the different types of fire were described in terms of color; there were one-colored flames, two-colored flames, and so on. The wood he had used earlier to heat the turtle-wok had been one-colored firewood.Big Fatty Zhang began to grow especially fond of Bai Xiaochun, and took special care of him. Furthermore, just as he\u2019d said, after a few months passed, Bai Xiaochun was starting to gain weight.He was no longer the scrawny kid he had been when he had first joined the sect. He was fatter, but at the same time, his skin was also fairer and clearer than before. He also looked more harmless than ever, and was clearly reaching the point of being deserving of the title Ninth Fatty Bai.He also experienced the special snack-time arrangement on more than one occasion. However, what Bai Xiaochun found especially frustrating was that, despite gaining weight, his cultivation seemed to progress as slowly as ever. Eventually, he stopped worrying about that and spent most of his time eating and drinking with his Elder Brothers. Life was good. As the months passed, he heard bits of gossip about recent events in the Spirit Stream Sect.In addition, Big Fatty Zhang taught him more about the sect in general. He learned that the sect disciples were divided into the Inner and Outer Sects. Any servant who could practice cultivation all the way to the third level of Qi Condensation would be able to challenge one of the trials by fire, which were paths that existed on the various mountain peaks in the sect. A servant who passed the trial by fire could join that mountain peak as an Outer Sect disciple. Only by becoming an Outer Sect disciple could anyone truly become a part of the Spirit Stream Sect.However, accomplishing such a feat would count as a stunning accomplishment, and would be equivalent to the old saying about . Only the top three competitors in the monthly trials by fire would be accepted, meaning that the number of people who could become an Outer Sect disciple was limited.On one particular day, Seventh Fatty had been scheduled to go out and purchase supplies, but ended up being busy with some other matters. As a result, Big Fatty Zhang called for Bai Xiaochun and told him to stand in for Seventh Fatty. Bai Xiaochun hesitated for a moment, recalling the incident with Xu Baocai from a few months before. Although it probably wasn\u2019t anything to worry about, he couldn\u2019t shake his anxiety. Before leaving, he went back to his room and collected eight meat cleavers [1. Quick note about the meat cleavers. In Chinese the word is literally \u201cvegetable knife,\u201d and could more properly be translated as \u201ckitchen knife.\u201d However, the most common kitchen knife that you find in most Chinese households is what we would call a cleaver in English. You can see that by going to baidu and doing an . You\u2019ll see a couple \u201cnormal\u201d kitchen knives in that image search, because the word could also mean that. However, in both home kitchens and restaurant kitchens in China, cleavers are used for everything from cutting big chunks of meat to julienning vegetables, as you can see ] and also donned six long leather coats. By the time he was finished getting dressed, he looked like a round ball.However, he also felt much safer, which was the important thing. The last thing he did was strap his wok onto his back, leaving him feeling very safe. He then staggered out of the Ovens and down the mountain.As he walked along the green limestone paths in the sect, he gazed around at the beautiful buildings and courtyards, and began to feel prouder than ever.\u201cHow time flies!\u201d he mused, clasping his hands behind his back. \u201cLife is like a dream. I, Bai Xiaochun, have only spent a few months practicing cultivation. However, as I think back to the mortal world, and my life in the village, it fills my eyes with tears.\u201d He walked along with eight meat cleavers hanging from his belt, a wok on his back, and multiple layers of clothing, looking very much like a dilapidated toy ball. Occasionally, he would encounter other servants, who would stare at him out of the corners of their eyes as he passed.There were even a few female disciples who couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud when they saw him. They covered their mouths with their hands, and the sound of their laughter was like silver bells, clear and melodious.Face slightly flushed, Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but feel even more impressive than ever. Clearing his throat, he stuck his chest out and continued to saunter along.Before too much time had passed, and before he had even left the third peak\u2019s servants\u2019 district, he noticed that quite a few servants were rushing off into the distance, looking very excited. They appeared to be heading in the direction of the path that led up to the top of the third peak, a place where Outer Sect disciples often congregated.More and more servants began running over in that direction, looking very excited. Surprised by the scene, Bai Xiaochun quickly grabbed a scrawny servant who happened to be running by.\u201cJunior Brother, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked quizzically. \u201cWhy is everyone running over there?\u201dThe young man looked over angrily, but then saw the black wok on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s back, and his expression turned envious.\u201cI didn't realize you were from the Ovens, Elder Brother. Why don\u2019t you come along? Two Chosen from the Outer Sect, Zhou Hong and Zhang Yide, are fighting it out in the trial by fire arena. Supposedly, the two of them have a beef with each other. Whatever happens, they're both at the sixth level of Qi Condensation, so we should be able to learn a bit by watching them, and maybe even gain some enlightenment.\u201d Finishing his explanation, the young man hurried off, apparently worried about missing out on any of the action.Feeling very curious, Bai Xiaochun set off in a hurry, following the flow of people as they left the servants\u2019 district and headed to the foot of the third peak, where a large raised platform could be seen.The platform was about 3,000 meters wide, and was surrounded by a crowd of servants. There were even people watching from positions further up on the mountain, all of whom wore resplendent clothing, and were clearly Outer Sect disciples.Two young men occupied the platform, both of whom wore extravagant outfits. One of them had a scar running down his face, the other had skin as white as jade. The two of them were fighting back and forth, causing booming sounds to echo out.The glow of magical items surrounded both of them. Floating in front of the scar-faced youth was a small flag that fluttered of its own volition, as if some invisible hand were waving it. The swirling flag formed the shape of a mist tiger, which let out deafening roars.The jade-faced youth danced back and forth as he fought. He had a small blue sword which whistled through the air, leaving behind streaks of light.When Bai Xiaochun saw the sword flying about, he gasped. Although he could control his own wooden sword in a similar way, it would be impossible to even compare his level of skill with that of the jade-faced young man.What was even more remarkable was how the two young men didn't seem to be holding anything back. Killing intent roiled off of them, and within a short time, numerous deadly situations arose. Both were heavily wounded, and despite the fact that the wounds weren\u2019t critical, it was still a shocking sight.This was Bai Xiaochun\u2019s first time seeing cultivators fighting, and it was very different from how he had imagined immortals would look when they fought. The cruel and vicious way they attacked each other left his heart pounding in fear.\u201cImmortal cultivation... isn\u2019t just about living forever? What\u2019s this fighting and killing all about? What if I end up losing my poor little life...?\u201d Bai Xiaochun swallowed nervously as he watched the scar-faced youth\u2019s mist tiger lunging voraciously at the other young man. Wiping the sweat from his brow, Bai Xiaochun suddenly realized that the outside world was a very dangerous place; it was probably a much better idea to stay back in the Ovens where it was safe.Having reached this conclusion, he began to hurry off when, all of a sudden, he heard someone shouting his name.\u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201dHe turned his head and saw the author of the blood notice, Xu Baocai, hurrying in his direction, a vicious expression on his face. A wooden sword floated next to him, glittering with an unusual light that clearly surpassed the first level of Qi Condensation. As the sword flew along, it left a streak of light in its wake, and sent a formidable spirit pressure emanating out.When Bai Xiaochun saw that wooden sword heading in his direction, his eyes went wide, and an intense sense of deadly crisis welled up in him.\u201cHe\u2019s gonna kill me!\u201d he thought.Instantly, he began to run in the opposite direction, screaming: \u201cMurder! Murder!\u201dThe other servants in the area all heard, and looked over in shock. The cries were so loud that even Zhou Hong and Zhang Yide stopped fighting.In fact, even Xu Baocai was unnerved by the screams. He had obviously just yelled Bai Xiaochun\u2019s name and then started to chase him. His sword hadn\u2019t even touched Bai Xiaochun, and yet Bai Xiaochun was screaming as though he had been stabbed repeatedly.Xu Baocai hated Bai Xiaochun so much his gums itched. Face ashen, he ran after him, shouting: \u201cCome on, Bai Xiaochun, you know how to fight! What are you running away for!?\u201d\u201cIf I knew how to fight, why would I be running away, you moron!? I would have killed you a long time ago! Murder! Murder!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s screams grew even louder as he fled in the opposite direction like a fat little bunny.Meanwhile, in a building which jutted out into the air at the very peak of the mountain, two men were in the middle of playing a game of Go. One was middle-aged, the other was an old man. The middle-aged man was none other than Li Qinghou. As for the old man, he had a full head of white hair, and a ruddy complexion. His eyes glittered brightly, and he was clearly no ordinary individual. Currently, he was looking down at the scene playing out down below.Chuckling, he said, \u201cWhat an interesting child you brought back to the sect, Qinghou.\u201d\u201cHow embarrassing, sect leader. The kid\u2019s personality definitely needs a lot more work.\u201d Feeling a headache coming on, Li Qinghou placed his game piece onto the board and then shook his head.\u201cThe kids in the Ovens are pretty stuck up, and yet this kid fits right in,\" scoffed the old man, stroking his beard. \"Not an easy task. Hmm...\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All of them could clearly see Bai Xiaochun, black wok on his back, wearing several layers of clothing, running at breakneck speed through the servants\u2019 district. He looked like a fat, round ball.From a distance, it was difficult to actually make out Bai Xiaochun himself, but you would definitely see the black wok, which made him look almost like a beetle as he flew along.Then there were the eight meat cleavers that hung from his belt, which clashed and clanked as he fled.\u201cMurder!\u201d he hollered as he ran, picking up speed. \u201cSomeone save me! I don\u2019t want to die\u2026.\u201dXu Baocai was hot on his tail, face ashen, eyes gleaming ferociously and heart filled with both anxiety and rage.Chasing Bai Xiaochun this way was catching quite a bit of attention from the servants, and Xu Baocai was worried that the Honor Guard might notice. The nervousness in his heart continued to grow.\u201cQuit screeching, dammit!\u201d Xu Baocai raged. \u201cQuiet down! What are you screaming for? Shut UP!\u201d Gritting his teeth, he performed a double-handed incantation gesture, causing the wooden sword to flicker with light and then shoot toward the fleeing Bai Xiaochun.A clang rang out as the wooden sword slammed into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s black wok. As the noise echoed out, Bai Xiaochun continued running as if nothing had happened.Xu Baocai gnashed his teeth. The big wok on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s back covered nearly half of his body, making it very difficult to hit him. However, feeling that he had little other choice, Xu Baocai continued to give chase.And so they raced through the servants\u2019 district, Bai Xiaochun leading the way, Xu Baocai running behind him.\u201cThis guy is pretty fast, even with that wok on his back!\u201d thought Xu Baocai, huffing and puffing as he fell further behind in the chase. His cultivation base was at the second level of Qi Condensation, and he was running as hard as he could. However, Bai Xiaochun was running with the passion of a rabbit whose tail had been stepped on. No matter what Xu Baocai did, he couldn\u2019t catch up.More horrifying was that he was starting to get tired, and yet hadn\u2019t even laid a finger on his opponent. In contrast, Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t seem to be the least bit tired at all, and was also screaming like a pig at the slaughterhouse.Soon, Bai Xiaochun caught sight of the little path leading to the Ovens, and his eyes glittered with excitement. He suddenly felt as though he were arriving home, and the sensation was so moving that he almost cried.\u201cElder Brother, save me!\u201d he cried. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to murder me!\u201d A trail of dust rose into the air behind him as he ran toward the Ovens at breakneck speed. Big Fatty Zhang and the others heard his screaming and hurried out, shocked expressions on their faces.\u201cElder Brother, save me! Xu Baocai is trying to kill me! My poor little life is on the line!\u201d Bai Xiaochun quickly scrambled behind Big Fatty Zhang.Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s eyes gleamed with a ferocious light as he looked around vigilantly, but he saw no one.\u201cXu Baocai?\u201d he asked. It was at this point that Xu Baocai finally appeared, huffing and puffing as he ran down the path toward the Ovens.When Bai Xiaochun realized how far behind Xu Baocai was, a quizzical expression appeared on his face.\u201cEee? Why is he running so slow?\u201dBig Fatty Zhang looked at Bai Xiaochun, and then back at the panting Xu Baocai. The motion caused the fat on his face to quiver a bit.Xu Baocai had expended a lot of effort in the chase, so as he neared the Ovens and then heard what Bai Xiaochun said, he was filled with so much rage that he felt like he was about to explode. With a roar, he waved his right hand, sending his wooden sword stabbing toward a nearby tree.A bang could be heard, and the tree quivered as the sword pierced through it, leaving behind a gaping hole.\u201cBai Xiaochun,\u201d he cried, \u201cour differences are irreconcilable!\u201d His eyes were completely bloodshot as he glared at Bai Xiaochun, and then the hulking Big Fatty Zhang. Finally, he turned angrily and began to stalk off back down the path.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart was pounding as he looked at the hole in the tree. Then he looked back at the fuming Xu Baocai, and swallowed hard as an uneasy feeling rose up in his heart.Big Fatty Zhang looked at Xu Baocai\u2019s retreating figure, and his eyes flickered with a sinister gleam. Then he patted Bai Xiaochun on the shoulder.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ninth Junior Brother. Xu Baocai might have some good connections in the sect, but if he dares show his face here again, we Elder Brothers will cut off one of his legs!\u201d Almost as soon as the words left his mouth, though, his tone changed. \u201cAlthough, it would probably be best if you didn\u2019t leave the Ovens, Ninth Junior Brother. You\u2019re looking a bit skinny, I think I should fatten you up a bit. After all, Elder Zhou is celebrating his decade-birthday in a few days.\u201dBai Xiaochun nodded his head absentmindedly as he stared at the hole Xu Baocai\u2019s wooden sword had left in the tree.He then followed his Elder Brothers back into the Ovens. Later, he sat in his room, brooding and feeling more uneasy than ever. The fact that his opponent could send a wooden sword through a tree meant that if it had hit him, he would definitely be a corpse now.\u201cThis isn\u2019t gonna work, not unless I plan on staying inside the Ovens for the rest of my life. What if he catches me next time I go out\u2026?\u201d Bai Xiaochun just couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the venomous look Xu Baocai had cast his way before leaving.\u201cI came here to live forever, not to die\u2026.\u201d The feeling of insecurity and anxiety caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes to slowly become shot with blood. After a long moment passed, he gritted his teeth.\u201cFudge! I\u2019m gonna do it! I\u2019m gonna go all-out! I\u2019m gonna go so all-out that I\u2019ll terrify myself, let alone everyone else!\u201d His eyes were now completely bloodshot. Instead of saying that Bai Xiaochun was the type of person who was afraid of dying, it would be more accurate to say that he was simply insecure. The ordeal he had just gone through had only served to stoke his determination.\u201cI\u2019m gonna practice cultivation! I\u2019m gonna get stronger!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s breath came in ragged pants as he made his decision. He pulled out the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art bamboo scroll, opened it up to the second illustration, and then immediately began to practice cultivation.He might be afraid of dying, but he was also viciously persistent. Were he not, he would never have been able to light that stick of incense thirteen times throughout the years, despite the threat of the lightning.Grinning with vicious determination, he assumed the posture in the second illustration, tenaciously maintaining the pose. Before, he had only been able to last for about ten breaths of time, but this time, he actually lasted for fifteen.He ended up wracked with pain, forehead dripping with great drops of sweat. However, the vicious gleam in his eye didn\u2019t fade. Soon, he was able to last for twenty breaths of time, then thirty. The small stream that was the qi vessel in his body was now ten percent complete. Gasping for breath, vision fading to black, he finally rested for a moment, then started cultivating again.The night passed relatively uneventfully. Soon it was the next day. And the day after that. And yet another day\u2026. Eventually fifteen days went by. Other than eating and visiting the restroom, Bai Xiaochun never left his room. To someone who had just begun the practice of cultivation, such tediousness was usually difficult to endure. However, Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even come close to giving up.Big Fatty Zhang and the others were shocked by his relentless practice of cultivation. It must be stated that cultivating the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art was no easy task. In principle, it was relatively simple. However, the postures that had to be maintained to reach the various levels all led to unimaginable pain, and therefore required incredible perseverance. Normally speaking, the servants in the sect would give up after only a few days of trying to cultivate it.Therefore, when Big Fatty Zhang and the others saw Bai Xiaochun continue to cultivate it for more than half a month, they felt like they were observing an entirely different person than the one they had met a few months ago.His clothes grew wrinkled, his hair became disheveled, his eyes were completely bloodshot. He seemed completely bedraggled, and at the same time, completely focused. Regardless of the pain he felt, he never gave up.Another thing that happened was that he began to lose some of the fat he had built up. At the same time, the spirit pressure he radiated increased by more than fifty percent. He was now very close to the great circle of the first level of Qi Condensation.Apparently, all of the precious materials he had eaten had built up in his fat. By practicing cultivation in the way he was, it was forcing those items to materialize as part of his cultivation base. It also ended up making his body tougher than the average person.\u201cNinth Junior Brother, why don\u2019t you take a break? You\u2019ve been practicing cultivation nonstop for more than half a month.\u201d Big Fatty Zhang and the others tried to persuade him to stop. However, when he looked up at them, they saw a gleam of determination in his eyes that left them shaken.Time passed. Soon, Bai Xiaochun had been practicing cultivation like mad for a full month. Big Fatty Zhang and the others were shocked. In fact, Big Fatty Zhang even said, \u201che\u2019s not cultivating, he\u2019s killing himself!\u201dBy this point in his cultivation, Bai Xiaochun could hold the pose in the second illustration for longer than 100 breaths of time. Soon, he reached 150 breaths of time. The spiritual energy inside of him was not a small stream any more. It was far, far larger than that.Another month passed. Big Fatty Zhang and the others trembled in fear, worried that Bai Xiaochun really was killing himself from working too hard. Even as they were working up a plan to go get rid of Xu Baocai, a huge rumbling could be heard coming from Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hut.As the sound echoed about, the spirit pressure of the second level of Qi Condensation erupted out from the hut, spreading for dozens of meters in all directions. As soon as Big Fatty Zhang and the others sensed it, they looked up with expressions of shock.\u201cLittle Junior Brother has broken through!\u201d\u201cThe second level of Qi Condensation! He hasn\u2019t even partaken of the Ovens\u2019 snack arrangement for more than half a year, and he\u2019s already reached the second level of Qi Condensation! That\u2019s pretty rare!\u201d\u201cIt took me a whole year to reach the second level of Qi Condensation\u2026.\u201d Even as they were making exclamations of shock, a crash could be heard as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s door opened, and he burst out, looking exhausted and disheveled. However, his eyes were glittering brightly.Big Fatty Zhang and the others were just about to hurry over to offer congratulations when Bai Xiaochun flashed through the air and nimbly landed on the bamboo fence that surrounded the Ovens. He clasped his hands behind his back and tilted his head up proudly, looking off into the distance with a profound gleam in his eyes. He looked every bit like a proud, lonesome hero.Big Fatty Zhang and the others exchanged dismayed glances.\u201cWhat is he standing there for? He looks so weird\u2026.\u201d\u201cDid little Junior Brother\u2026 get possessed or something?\u201dAlmost as soon as they looked over at Bai Xiaochun and his odd appearance, they heard his voice echoing out, sounding proud and wise.\u201cXu Baocai is a consummate Chosen among the servants of the Spirit Stream Sect, matchlessly vicious, and famous far and wide. His cultivation base is even in the terrifying second level of Qi Condensation. However, my cultivation base is also in the second level of Qi Condensation. A fight between us will be an even match. It will likely be a fight talked about in all the lands, a battle that will shake the entire sect. However, it must be fought, no matter how much blood and gore flows, no matter how many bones are shattered and tendons\u2026 wait a second. No, this battle is far, far too important. I have to keep practicing cultivation!\u201dHaving finished speaking, Bai Xiaochun looked around for a moment, then flicked his sleeve and returned to his room. The door slammed shut behind him as he began another session of secluded meditation. Big Fatty Zhang and the others swallowed hard, and exchanged glances. Finally, Third Fatty Hei said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me we gave Junior Brother some spoiled food?\u201dSecond Fatty Huang shivered and replied, \u201cOh no! This is bad! Junior Brother is drunk on spiritual energy! He\u2019s gone crazy from cultivation\u2026. We mustn\u2019t provoke him now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 7: Bonding the Turtle-WokPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7: Bonding the Turtle-WokIn the following days, Big Fatty Zhang and the others kept a constant eye out on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s thatched hut. As for Bai Xiaochun, breaking through to the second level of Qi Condensation gave him quite a boost in self-confidence, and he continued to focus on cultivation.Currently, he was in his room, wiping the sweat from his brow. He was buck naked, gritting his teeth against the pain as he tried to maintain the posture of the third image in the bamboo scroll.His qi vessel was no longer a flowing stream, but rather, a small river. It flowed through his body, and with every rotation, cracking sounds would emanate out from inside of him. His previously rotund body was now thin once again, and in fact, he was even thinner than when he had first arrived in the Ovens.However, there seemed to be energy building up in his body. As he continued to practice cultivation, the flesh and muscle that covered his skinny frame pulsed with power. In fact, if you listened carefully, you would even be able to hear the sound of his heartbeat echoing about in his room.More and more spirit pressure was condensing inside of him, filling Bai Xiaochun with a feeling of increasing power. After several more days passed, the pain increased to point where it was simply too much, and he had to give up.He was left panting, eyes completely bloodshot. He had the strong feeling that he simply couldn\u2019t continue on this way. Although he naturally absorbed the spiritual power of Heaven and Earth while cultivating, that flow simply couldn\u2019t keep up with how much power he was wasting. Furthermore, the Ovens\u2019 snack arrangement wasn\u2019t a regular occurrence, and only happened on lucky occasions.Most other people cultivated the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art by practicing it once every few days. Even people who were more devoted would only practice it once per day. In contrast, Bai Xiaochun had been practicing nonstop. It was no small wonder that Big Fatty Zhang and the others were shocked. In fact, many Inner Sect disciples would have been astonished to hear about what he was doing.However, having reached this level of cultivation still left Bai Xiaochun feeling insecure and uneasy. After all, he was the type of person who would rather be safe than sorry. Finally, he pulled out the grain of spirit rice that he had enhanced and looked at it for a long moment before using an ordinary wok to cook it up. After the spiritual energy began to waft out of it, he quickly gobbled it down.As soon as the spirit rice entered his mouth, it turned into a thick blast of spiritual energy that was exponentially more powerful than ordinary spirit rice. In fact, the two types couldn\u2019t even be considered to be on the same level. As the rumbling sounds echoed out inside of him, he began to practice cultivation. He instantly assumed the posture in the third illustration, and at the same time, began to regulate his breathing.Half a month later, deep in the night, a tremor ran through Bai Xiaochun, and he opened his eyes. He suddenly realized that at some indeterminable point, he had actually broken through from the second level of Qi Condensation to the third level.This development caused him to go wild with joy. Excitement filled his eyes, and he began to laugh uproariously. Examining himself, he realized that the qi vessel inside of him had thoroughly transformed into a small river.The small river circulated through his body at high speed, moving far, far faster than it had before. In fact, he could even send the spiritual energy around to different parts of his body, all with a simple thought.\u201cThe third level of Qi Condensation! That spirit enhancement was incredible!\u201d He rose to his feet, licking his lips at the thought of producing another spirit-enhanced grain of spirit rice. However, it was at this point that he remembered something the bamboo scroll had mentioned about the growth of internal meridians. Right now, he needed to let his body adapt to the expanded meridians, and temporarily couldn\u2019t continue to practice cultivation.Putting his idea about the spirit rice on the back burner, he walked out of his room, all the while looking extremely proud of himself. However, almost as soon as he set foot out the door, he caught sight of the little path outside of the Ovens, and the tree with the hole in it. Although it was late at night, the tree was clearly visible in the moonlight.\u201cThis won\u2019t do. Xu Baocai\u2019s wooden sword is obviously beyond ordinary. Even being in the third level of Qi Condensation won\u2019t guarantee my safety!\u201d Frowning, he stood there in thought for a moment before taking out his own multi-colored wooden sword. Then he looked back at the wok inside his room.\u201cI think I\u2019ll feel a bit more confident if I do a second spirit enhancement,\u201d he thought. Without any further hesitation, he retrieved some of the Ovens\u2019 spirit wood.After getting fully prepared, he stood in front of his mysterious wok and kindled the fire. Once the design on the wok lit up, he tossed the wooden sword inside.However, after waiting for quite some time, there didn\u2019t seem to be any reaction. Bai Xiaochun frowned and looked at the design on the turtle-wok, then glanced down and realized that the fire had already burned out. Nothing but ash remained of the wood. Muttering to himself, he went out to find some more spirit wood. However, after burning several more batches, he didn\u2019t see any difference in the wooden sword.\u201cThese pieces of firewood are all for one-colored flames,\u201d he thought. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s just not hot enough. Maybe I need the heat\u2026 of a two-colored flame?\u201d He left his room again and found a piece of violet-colored firewood, which was relatively rare in the Ovens. In fact, after searching for a while, he could only find a single piece.After kindling it, the flame appeared, a two-colored flame that was far hotter than a one-colored flame!Almost as soon as the two-colored flame touched the surface of the turtle-wok, the second design began to shine brightly. As for the flame itself, it rapidly began to fade away; apparently the power of the flame was being sucked away. Soon, the two-colored flame had burned out, leaving behind nothing but ash. However, the turtle-wok\u2019s second design was now shining brightly.\u201cIt worked!\u201d he thought, eyes shining. He quickly put the wooden sword back inside, whereupon silver light began to shimmer. This time, it lasted for several breaths of time longer than the first time he had done the spirit enhancement.The light began to dim, but then, it suddenly flared up and shot directly toward Bai Xiaochun. This sudden change occurred so quickly that he couldn\u2019t even react. His vision swam with light as an indescribably cold sensation washed through him. It almost felt as if he were being frozen over. There was nothing he could do to stop it from happening; it felt as if the coldness was viciously grabbing at his insides.His face went pale, and his vision blurred. It was as if something inside of him was being sucked out and merged into the turtle-wok.Finally, the silver light faded away, and within the wok, the wooden sword appeared, sharper than ever. In fact, it was so sharp that looking at it hurt the eyes.Although it was still painted gaudily, the veins of the wood inside had already changed. If you scraped away the paint, you would find that they seemed to be filled with starlight, as if the sword had been thoroughly and completely transformed.In virtually the same moment as the new wooden sword appeared, thunder crackled in the air above the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect. It was almost as if the Heavens were rumbling in rage, causing shock to rise up in the hearts of countless cultivators in the Spirit Stream Sect. However, almost as soon as the thunder crackled out, it was gone.As the thunder was booming, a second silver design appeared on the wooden sword. After flickering for a moment, the design faded away into the gaudy paint.Bai Xiaochun, however, couldn\u2019t even look at the sword. He staggered backward, a grim look on his face. After a long moment passed, he recovered his composure, although fear still lingered in his heart.\u201cWhat did it suck out of me\u2026?\u201d he thought, nervously looking at his reflection in the copper mirror on the wall. After examining himself closely for a moment, he rubbed his eyes, then gaped at his reflection, looking as shocked as a wooden chicken.There in the mirror, he could see that at the very top of his forehead was a white hair. Although his face didn\u2019t look any different, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the white hair made him look at least a year older.\u201cMy lifespan!!\u201d he murmured, aghast.\u201cJust now, my lifespan was reduced. My\u2026 my\u2026\u201d He wanted to cry, but no tears would come. His whole purpose in learning about cultivation was to live forever. Now, instead of reaching the goal of living forever, he had actually lost one year of his lifespan, which was a huge blow.\u201cScrewed\u2026. How could I ever have imagined that I, Bai Xiaochun, would be so careful in life, only to end up screwing myself like this\u2026.\u201d He sat there in a daze for a while before finally chuckling bitterly. After calming himself down, he looked back at the turtle-wok, whereupon a strange gleam gradually rose in his eyes. For some reason, after having some of his longevity sucked away, it now felt like there was some sort of connection between him and the wok, as if he could actually control it now.Heart thumping, he extended his hand and pointed a finger at it.The turtle-wok immediately flickered, shrank down, and flew toward Bai Xiaochun. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared into the tip of his finger. Eyes wide with shock, Bai Xiaochun leapt to his feet and backed up a few steps. He looked down at his finger, and then back at the empty stove.\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026.\u201d He pointed his finger down at the ground, and a black gleam of light flashed, and a clanking sound rang out as the wok appeared once more.After experimenting a few more times, his expression flickered from grim, to delighted, to mournful. Finally, he sighed.\u201cWell, I can suck this thing into my body, but the price I had to pay was a year of longevity. How come it still seems like I screwed myself?\u201dThe next day at noon, Bai Xiaochun was trying to figure out a way to get back the longevity which had been sucked away from him. He was in the middle of doing some research when, all of a sudden, he looked up. He had just sensed that there were eight people heading toward the entrance of the Ovens.That was something he would never have been able to detect when only in the first level of Qi Condensation. However, now that he was in the third level, he could instantly sense that one of the eight people was none other than Xu Baocai.Almost at the same time, Xu Baocai\u2019s voice suddenly rang out, filled with fury and hatred.\u201cBai Xiaochun, you have Elder Brothers to protect you, but so do I! Today, the enmity between the two of is going to end permanently!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 8: We're Gonna Go All Out!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as he realized that Xu Baocai was coming, Bai Xiaochun shot to his feet.\u201cWell, he came sooner than expected....\u201d he thought, his eyes flickering with hesitation. Although he had done everything he could to prepare in the last half-year or so, he still didn't feel ready. As far as he was concerned, the best option would have been to go into the conflict in the fourth level of Qi Condensation. Only then would he have felt safe.Seeing that Xu Baocai had come with a group of seven others, Bai Xiaochun knew that hiding wasn\u2019t an option. Gritting his teeth, he said, \u201cFine! I\u2019m gonna go for it!\u201dTaking a deep breath, he quickly donned eight leather coats, and then attached his backup wok to his back. Only then did he nervously open his door and step out.The first thing he saw was Big Fatty Zhang and the others out by the front gate, hefting meat cleavers and huge kitchen ladles as they blocked the path of Xu Baocai and his friends.\u201cI was wondering why I heard the crows squawking this morning,\u201d Big Fatty Zhang roared, his voice echoing like thunder as he stood there, tall and mountain-like. \u201cAs it turns out, a bunch of brats from the Supervisors\u2019 Department decided to come cause a scene here in the Ovens!\u201d\u201cOther people might be scared of the Ovens, Big Fatty Zhang, but the Supervisors\u2019 Department doesn\u2019t give a crap about you. We received a complaint from Junior Brother Xu, and we're here with the authority of the Supervisors\u2019 Department. Do you really dare to resist us?\u201d Seven arrogant-looking men clustered around Xu Baocai. Although they wore servant uniforms, their sleeves were conspicuously embroidered with the character \u2018Supervisor,\u2019 indicating that they were from the Supervisors\u2019 Department, and had a status and power beyond ordinary servants.One of the men was a burly fellow who looked as tough as a tiger and as sturdy as a bear. He emanated the spirit pressure of the third level of Qi Condensation, and his eyes glittered coldly as he stared at Big Fatty Zhang. Apparently, he didn't seem fazed at all by Big Fatty Zhang and the others.\u201cHogwash!\u201d replied Big Fatty Zhang. \u201cHe was trying to kill my Junior Brother. How do you explain that!?\u201d He then laughed coldly as his hand whistled through the air, causing the big black wok on his back to suddenly fly up into the air, looking completely majestic. The burly man\u2019s cohorts looked on with flickering expressions, and as for the burly man himself, his eyes widened. Then his hand flashed in an incantation gesture, causing a small flag to fly out. Mist poured out of the flag, from within which the roaring of a wild beast could be heard.Even as the figurative swords were being drawn, Xu Baocai saw Bai Xiaochun stepping out of his thatched hut, and all his previous rancor and hatred erupted inside of him.\u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201d he roared.As soon as the words left Xu Baocai\u2019s mouth, he waved his hand, sending his wooden sword flying out.Looks of shock could be seen on the faces of Big Fatty Zhang and the others. Just as they were about to leap to stop the wooden sword, the burly man from the Supervisors\u2019 Department laughed coldly and blocked their path.However, it was in that same instant that Bai Xiaochun, eyes bloodshot, roared, \u201cXu Baocai, you\u2019ve pushed things too far! You and I are going to go all out!\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s heart was pounding. He had never actually been in a fight in his entire life, much less magical combat against another cultivator.He was so nervous that he was shaking. Roaring to build his own courage, he unleashed the power of the third level of Qi Condensation, holding nothing back from his cultivation base. He poured all of his spiritual energy into his wooden sword, then waved his finger to send it flying toward Xu Baocai.As the wooden sword whistled through the air, the two designs hidden by the garish paint flickered slightly. Suddenly, the sword expanded in size and exploded with an oppressive coldness as it bore down on Xu Baocai.The speed and majesty with which it shot through the air caused Big Fatty Zhang, as well as the group from the Supervisors\u2019 Department, to gasp and stare in astonishment. As the ferocious aura of the sword filled the area, all hearts were struck with shock, and suddenly, nobody was interested in fighting any more, and instead stared at the sword.Xu Baocai hadn\u2019t even gotten close to Bai Xiaochun yet, and was struck with terror by his energy. From what he could tell, this version of Bai Xiaochun was completely different than the person he had faced several months before. The way he gritted his teeth and looked like he was going all out caused Xu Baocai\u2019s heart to fill with shock.Next, his eyes widened with disbelief as he saw Bai Xiaochun\u2019s wooden sword speeding toward him. It was like a stream of white light, bursting with the type of energy that he had only seen during fights between Outer Sect disciples. He was so flabbergasted that his scalp went numb.A bang rang out as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s wooden sword slammed into Xu Baocai\u2019s. Xu Baocai\u2019s wooden sword trembled, completely incapable of standing up to the force of the blow. Starting from the tip, it shattered into pieces. In the blink of an eye, it was completely destroyed, transformed into countless shimmering fragments.As for Bai Xiaochun\u2019s wooden sword, it didn't even pause. It continued to shoot through the air toward Xu Baocai, who by this point was scared witless. Using all the power he could muster, he dodged out of the way. The wooden sword whistled past him, slicing his shoulder in the process, and then slashing into a nearby tree.A boom rattled out as the tree was chopped completely in half, and then collapsed onto the ground, sending a cloud of dust into the air. Xu Baocai let out a miserable shriek as blood splashed all over his arm. Face pale, he immediately fell back.Luckily for him, Bai Xiaochun wasn't very adept at controlling physical objects. Otherwise, that sword would definitely have killed him.\u201cThird level of Qi Condensation! Impossible! This is impossible!\u201d Xu Baocai looked at Bai Xiaochun, and he seemed as terrified as if he had just caught sight of a ghost. To be able to unleash such power in a wooden sword clearly required the third level of Qi Condensation, and he simply could not imagine how Bai Xiaochun could have made such an astonishing transformation in only a few months. Things were playing out in exactly the opposite as he had imagined they would, which was impossible for him to accept. It was like he was in a living nightmare.He wasn\u2019t the only shocked one. The burly man from the Supervisors\u2019 Department and all of his friends all gasped and looked over at Bai Xiaochun with serious expressions.\u201cForming sharpness with spiritual energy and unleashing sword light! That\u2019s only possible by cultivating the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art into the Lightness-in-Heaviness Realm! There\u2019s no other way to unleash a divine ability like that!\u201d The burly man from the Supervisors\u2019 Department gasped, and fear could now be seen in his eyes as he looked at Bai Xiaochun.His fellows had the exact same reaction, and there was almost no need to even mention Big Fatty Zhang and the others, who were also completely shocked. Although they had sensed that Bai Xiaochun had reached the third level of Qi Condensation, the fact that he could cause sword light to emanate out from the wooden sword, and also make it grow larger, showed that he really had reached the Lightness-in-Heaviness Realm, something they had been completely unaware of before.Even Bai Xiaochun was a bit shaken by what had just happened with the wooden sword. He stared at the toppled tree, then at the ashen-faced Xu Baocai, and suddenly threw his head back and laughed.\u201cSo, Xu Baocai, it turns out you are the weak one! Eat my sword!\u201d Delighted that he was clearly stronger than Xu Baocai, Bai Xiaochun immediately began chasing Xu Baocai, laughing the entire time.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s gaze caused Xu Baocai to tremble, and the sight of him rushing over, laughing uproariously, was completely terrifying. Xu Baocai immediately scrambled to flee.However, he could only take a few steps before Bai Xiaochun was upon him. As he closed in, Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but think of how Xu Baocai had chased him relentlessly, forcing him to spend so many bitter days practicing cultivation. That bitterness turned into power, which he now used to kick viciously at Xu Baocai.\u201cLet\u2019s see you try to kill me again!\u201d he yelled, punching Xu Baocai in the eye. Xu Baocai let out a miserable shriek and fell to the ground. He wanted to fight back, but his cultivation base was only at the second level of Qi Condensation, leaving him powerless to do anything to Bai Xiaochun.\u201cYou provoked the Young Master, so now he\u2019s going to show you that he's not to be trifled with!\u201d Fuming with rage, Bai Xiaochun continued to kick and punch Xu Baocai, who was now wailing in anguish.Cracking sounds could be heard that caused both the burly man and the others from the Supervisors\u2019 Department, as well as Big Fatty Zhang and the others, to all stare in shock. They watched Xu Baocai being beaten, and Bai Xiaochun excitedly doing the beating, and their hearts prickled with fear.Tears streamed down Xu Baocai's face, and his heart overflowed with grief. He still couldn\u2019t believe that Bai Xiaochun had experienced such a drastic transformation in just a few short months. Even more unbelievable was that he could use the divine ability of Lightness-in-Heaviness. That was something that was impossible to achieve without years of work and significant skill.In his mind, Bai Xiaochun obviously must have someone powerful helping him. Furthermore, he was surely more powerful than he had let on before. However, because of his despicable and shameless personality, he had pretended to be weak. Most outrageous was that Xu Baocai had completely fallen for the act.At that point, Xu Baocai was overwhelmed with sorrow, and simply passed out.Seeing that Xu Baocai had fallen unconscious, Bai Xiaochun patted the dust off of his clothes and then waved his hand, causing his wooden sword to fly over into his sleeve. Then, looking every bit the lonely hero, he did his best to hide the excitement in his eyes.The burly man from the Supervisors\u2019 Department looked deeply at him, his expression conflicted. Finally, he clasped hands and bowed.\u201cJunior Brother Bai, you did a good job of concealing your true strength,\u201d he said, his face expressionless. \u201cYou\u2019ve earned our admiration.\u201d Then, he turned and left with his fellows, picking up the unconscious Xu Baocai and taking him along too.After they left, Big Fatty Zhang and the others clustered around Bai Xiaochun, smiling broadly. After all, the people from the Supervisors\u2019 Department were outsiders, and they knew that Bai Xiaochun had worked hard over the past months. Therefore they were pleased with the overall outcome.\u201cNice work, kid. You didn't kill yourself for half a year for nothing!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang patted Bai Xiaochun\u2019s shoulder.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I worked so hard that I scared even myself!\u201d Bai Xiaochun lifted his chin as proudly as a cocky rooster, as if daring Big Fatty Zhang and the others to ever laugh at him again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 9: Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing PillPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9: Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing PillAccording to an ancient saying, time flying by is like catching a glimpse of a white colt flashing past a chink in a wall. That is exactly what happened for Bai Xiaochun. A month later, cold winds blew down the Heavenspan River and through the Spirit Stream Sect. All of a sudden, Bai Xiaochun realized that he had been in the sect for a year already.The past year had been chock-full of one event after another. He had left the world of mortals to become a cultivator, elevated his cultivation base to the third level of Qi Condensation, and had resolved all the conflicts that cropped up due to him joining the Ovens.Xu Baocai never showed up at the Ovens again, and when Bai Xiaochun left on supply runs and saw him from a distance, he would scurry away, clearly terrified.Despite all of that, however, after a month went by, Bai Xiaochun looked as anxious as ever, and was sighing constantly. He didn\u2019t talk to Big Fatty Zhang and the others about his concerns; he simply wallowed in his helplessness.\u201cOne year of longevity\u2026.\u201d he thought, looking at a tree off in the distance, whose leaves had already begun to turn yellow and fall to the ground.\u201cI\u2019m just like that tree, and those falling leaves are just like my one lost year of longevity\u2026.\u201d Having reached this point in his train of thought, Bai Xiaochun suddenly felt very sentimental.During the course of the past month, he had come up with countless ideas on how to restore the lost longevity, and yet, that white hair on his head remained as white as ever. He made some roundabout inquiries of Big Fatty Zhang, and learned that in the cultivation world, methods did indeed exist which could restore longevity. However, such methods were either well-kept secrets, or as easy to track down as a phoenix feather or a qilin horn.Soon, he even lost interest in eating and drinking, and his face became wan and pallid. Eventually, he decided that he had no choice but to give up and accept the fact that he had lost the longevity. However, the following day when he went out on an Ovens supply run, he happened to catch sight of an enormous stone stele below the Third Peak, and all of a sudden, he started to pant.On the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect, all of the mountain peaks had stone steles like this one. It was covered with dense script, lines and lines of writing that glittered with bright light. Occasionally, the lines of script would flow like water as old characters were replaced by new ones.That stone stele was where missions were handed out by the Spirit Stream Sect. Anyone in the sect who wanted to could accomplish the missions to earn the spirit stones necessary for cultivation, as well as merit points.The merit points could be used to pay admission fees to scripture sermons or the Magical Arts Pavilion. They could also be used to gain access to all sorts of special places in the sect set aside for certain aspects of cultivation. Virtually everything in the sect could be acquired with merit points, and they were actually viewed as more valuable than spirit stones.At the moment, quite a few Outer Sect disciples were gathered around the Third Peak\u2019s Mission Stele, staring at the missions. When one of them selected a mission to take, they would respectfully notify the middle-aged cultivator sitting cross-legged beneath the stele.There were even some servants mingling with the Outer Sect disciples. The servants wore their uniforms, and the Outer Sect disciples wore green robes embroidered with cloud and river designs, making it very easy to tell who was who.There were certain missions that only Inner Sect disciples could accept, but missions like that wouldn\u2019t show up on this particular stone stele. The missions here could be accepted by Outer Sect disciples and servants alike.Many ambitious servants viewed this place as their first step in becoming like that fish which leaped over the dragon gate, achieving a meteoric rise.Bai Xiaochun stood there for the time it takes an incense stick to burn, face grim as he stared at one particular line of script in the middle of the stone stele. Eventually, a look of hesitation appeared in his eyes.\u201cAge-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill\u2026.\u201d he murmured. \u201cI never imagined that this stone stele would offer a medicinal pill like that as a reward. From the name alone, you can tell that the pill probably increases longevity.\u201d After a bit of thought, he approached the middle-aged cultivator.When the Outer Sect disciples sensed Bai Xiaochun approaching, they completely ignored him. Considering their status, they didn\u2019t care at all about servants, who they viewed as beneath them.Bai Xiaochun waited until the crowd around the middle-aged cultivator thinned a bit, then, looking as charming and innocent as possible, clasped hands and bowed in greeting.\u201cGood afternoon, Elder Brother,\u201d he said.The middle-aged cultivator looked Bai Xiaochun up and down, then nodded slightly.The problem of his own longevity swirled in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind as he asked:\u201cElder Brother, one of the missions is to go search for some medicinal plants. The reward is an Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill. Might I ask whether or not that pill is useful for extending longevity?\u201d\u201cAge-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill\u2026. Yeah, it\u2019s this mission right here. That pill really can prolong your age and enhance your longevity. In fact, it adds a whole year. However, it has a lot of limitations. It can only be used if you\u2019re at the fifth level of Qi Condensation or lower, and can only be consumed once. If you take the pill more than one time, it simply won\u2019t do anything. You could say that it\u2019s valuable, but unfortunately, one year of longevity doesn\u2019t really count for much.\u201d Seeing how charming and innocent Bai Xiaochun looked, the middle-aged cultivator decided to add a bit more information.\u201cGenerally speaking, this is a pill that disciples will give to their mortal family members who are reaching the ends of their lives. However, it\u2019s still very expensive. Do you want to accept the mission?\u201dBai Xiaochun looked back at the stone stele, did some calculations, and then nodded.The middle-aged cultivator waved his finger at the stone stele, and the mission turned gray. At the same time, he produced a jade slip which he handed over to Bai Xiaochun.\u201cGreenspirit Leaf, Earthdragon Fruit, and Stonebeetle Husk,\u201d the man said coolly. \u201cCollect the proper amounts of those three medicinal ingredients, and you can exchange them for an Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill.\u201d After that, he paid no further heed to Bai Xiaochun, and instead turned and began to explain other missions to the nearby Outer Sect disciples.Bai Xiaochun left, clutching the jade slip in his hands, the term \u201cAge-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill\u201d echoing about in his mind. His eyes began to glow with decisiveness.\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to get that medicinal pill and make up for the one year of longevity I lost.\u201dBursting with determination, he hurried to the Four Seas Room, where he poured over the information available to servants. He soon found an introduction to Greenspirit Leaf, a type of medicinal plant that only grew in habitats occupied by Hopespirit Birds. Hopespirit Birds lived in large colonies, and usually grew to the second level of Qi Condensation, making the Greenspirit Leaf difficult to harvest. As a result, it tended to be expensive.Unfortunately, there was no record in the Four Seas Room of the Earthdragon Fruit or the Stonebeetle Husk. Bai Xiaochun patted his bag, smiled bitterly, and left. After returning to the Ovens, he asked Big Fatty Zhang and the others about them. Nobody had ever heard of Earthdragon Fruit, but Third Fatty Hei knew about Stonebeetle Husk. Apparently, it was nothing more than the molted exoskeleton of a type of Spirit Insect called a Stonebeetle.Supposedly, those exoskeletons were extremely tough and heavy, but were uncommon on the south shore. However, they were common on the north shore, a result of the fact that most of the techniques they cultivated there were shamanic magics. Unfortunately, despite the fact that both the north and south shores were part of the Spirit Stream Sect, they were separated by the main mountain bridge. Furthermore, only Inner Sect disciples qualified to be able to cross that mountain bridge to get from one shore to the other.\u201cWhat are you asking about these medicinal ingredients for?\u201d Big Fatty Zhang asked, patting his stomach. \u201cYou can\u2019t eat them, you know. Besides, if you try to buy them at the south bank market, the prices are ridiculously high.\u201dWhen Bai Xiaochun heard the word \u2018market\u2019 mentioned, his eyes suddenly lit up. After offering a quick explanation, he hurried down the mountain. In the year he had been a part of the Ovens, he had only been out of the sect on a few occasions, and yet, was very familiar with the market outside of the sect.Most of the stalls were run by various cultivator clans related to sect disciples. There were even some establishments that were owned by disciples, and catered specifically to other disciples. Gradually, a set of unspoken rules had come to be established that everyone abided by.Generally speaking, any supplies that the Ovens needed could be found here.Bai Xiaochun strolled around the market for a while and visited several medicinal plant shops. By the time he got back to the Ovens, his brow was furrowed and he was heaving sighs left and right.\u201cWhat a rip-off! Especially the Earthdragon Fruit. All it is is a kind of fruit that grows underground. Why is it so expensive!?\u201d Bai Xiaochun was dismayed to discover that, given his current situation, he was essentially incapable of getting the Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill.He basically had no concept of money. To him, no amount of wealth could compare to longevity. Unfortunately, he was currently embarrassingly short on funds. Furthermore, he knew that although his Elder Brothers possessed extremely ample bellies, their bags were as empty as his. They definitely weren\u2019t any richer than he was.Although nobody would go to the trouble of calling them to task for eating a bit of the food from the Ovens\u2019 supplies, if they tried to sell that food, the Supervisor\u2019s Department would definitely catch on, and would not be happy.After thinking about the matter from numerous angles, Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t come up with any ideas for how to make some money, other than to sell some spirit enhanced items.However, that didn\u2019t quite seem like the appropriate thing to do. He continued to ponder the matter for a few more days. On one particular morning, he was sitting cross-legged in his hut practicing cultivation when he heard the sound of bells echoing out through the sect.The sound wasn\u2019t very loud, and quickly faded away. Bai Xiaochun slowly opened his eyes. He wasn\u2019t surprised by the tolling of the bells. In fact, they rang out every month. He had learned from Big Fatty Zhang that the bells indicated that a trial by fire was beginning for servants. Whoever succeeded would be given a spot as an Outer Sect disciple.For those extremely ambitious servants who wanted to become Outer Sect disciples, the first step to becoming the fish who leaped over the dragon gate was to reach the third level of Qi Condensation. Then they could select one of the trials by fire. The trials by fire were nothing more than a path of stone steps that led to the top of the mountain peak. However, that path was imbued with magical power, making each step extremely arduous. Anyone who managed to make it to the top would be qualified to become an Outer Sect disciple.Unfortunately, spots in the Outer Sect were limited, so only the first three competitors to the top, the best of the best, would be able to get in. After all, there were many servants in the Spirit Stream Sect. There were thousands and thousands on the south bank alone. Therefore, there were always fierce struggles to succeed.Of course, the members of the Ovens would rather die of starvation in the Ovens than try to climb the ladder in the Outer Sect. Therefore, on this particular day every month, they turned their noses up at all the hustle and bustle.Bai Xiaochun closed his eyes. However, a moment later, they snapped open, and a strange expression could be seen therein. Then, they began to glitter with excitement as a new idea formed in his head. He shot to his feet and began to pace back and forth inside his hut. After considering this idea for quite some time, a delighted expression appeared on his face.\u201cThis is the ticket!\u201d he exclaimed. Then he pushed his door open and cried out to Big Fatty Zhang and the others, who were currently debating about which unlucky servant would be promoted to be an Outer Sect disciple.\u201cElder Brothers, I\u2019ve figured out how to get rich, but I need your help. Then, we can all get rich together!\u201d He licked his lips and looked at Big Fatty Zhang and the others, eyes gleaming.Big Fatty Zhang was familiar with this expression; it was the same look Bai Xiaochun had on his face when he brought up the idea of making the bottoms of the bowls thicker. Considering how much that idea had benefited the Ovens, Big Fatty Zhang couldn\u2019t wait to hear Bai Xiaochun\u2019s idea.\u201cNinth Fatty, what\u2019s your plan? To tell you the truth, we\u2019re all completely destitute, and it\u2019s all the fault of that damned Supervisor\u2019s Department. If it weren\u2019t for them, we could sell some of our stuff and get totally rich!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang clapped Bai Xiaochun on the shoulder, eyes shining with anticipation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s eyes looked like they were about to erupt with flames. Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat, feeling more than a little bit proud of himself.\u201cElder Brother, check this out. The three mountain peaks of the Spirit Stream Sect all have a trial by fire every month, giving us servants a chance to become like the fish that leaped over the dragon gate, right? Bai Xiaochun glanced around at everyone, looking like the picture of charm and innocence.Big Fatty Zhang nodded in response.\u201cHowever, the sect only wants the best of the best. Therefore, no matter how many people participate in the trial by fire, only the top three disciples per mountain peak get picked. Am I right?\u201d He licked his lips, and his eyes were beginning to shine. Big Fatty Zhang listened thoughtfully.A ruminative expression could also be seen on Third Fatty Hei\u2019s face, although everyone else seemed confused.Big Fatty Zhang looked at Bai Xiaochun, and his eyes also began to shine. \u201cDo you mean\u2026.\u201d\u201cConsidering the levels of your cultivation bases, Elder Brothers, and mine, it would be easy to sweep the trials by fire of all three mountains\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun looked around at his Elder Brothers. All of them had cultivation bases at the third level of Qi Condensation; Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei were actually at the peak of the third level. Were it not for the fact that they didn\u2019t want to leave the Ovens, and thus kept their cultivation bases suppressed, they could have broken through to the next level long ago.\u201cTherefore,\u201d Bai Xiaochun continued, speaking very quickly, \u201call we have to do is get to the peak of the mountains as quickly as possible, and hold the top three spots. Then, we can\u2026 sell them to whoever comes along after us!\u201d He stopped and looked at Big Fatty Zhang and the others.Big Fatty Zhang was trembling.\u201cSo low down\u2026.\u201d he said. Then he took a deep breath and slapped his thigh. An unprecedentedly bright glow appeared in his eyes. The method described by Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t very complicated at all, and was in fact quite simple. It was merely a different way of thinking that, after being spoken out loud, was easy to understand. However, before being explained, it was actually the opposite of what everyone would have thought the idea to be.Big Fatty Zhang seemed to be in the midst of spiritual enlightenment. It was as if a door had been opened, leading to a brand new type of life. He couldn\u2019t hold back from laughing heartily.Third Fatty Hei stamped an excited foot, face flushed from either embarrassment or excitement. \u201cThis couldn\u2019t be any more low down! Hahaha!\u201dAs the other fatties understood, they started getting excited. Panting, they couldn\u2019t help but stare at Bai Xiaochun with more admiration than ever.\u201cGreat idea! Let\u2019s do it!\u201d\u201cFudge! That bunch of bastards from the Supervisor\u2019s Department have persecuted us into poverty for years now. Thankfully, Ninth Junior Brother is here now. Let\u2019s do it!\u201d Then, they began to excitedly discuss the details of how to carry out such a plan.After they were sure that there was nothing they had overlooked, they decided to try out their scheme in the following month\u2019s trials by fire. Big Fatty Zhang slapped his thigh in delight.\u201cTonight is snack night!\u201dExcited conversations filled the Ovens. The following month was one of extreme enthusiasm. In fact, just to play it safe, everyone took time to practice cultivation, which was a rare occurrence. In the end, everyone was waiting impatiently for the day of the trial by fire to arrive.Finally, it did.The sun shone brightly in the morning sky. Beneath the three mountain peaks on the south shore of the Spirit Stream Sect, an unprecedented scene was playing out. There at the entrance to each of the trails leading up the mountains, shockingly, three black woks appeared.A closer look revealed that underneath those black woks were extraordinarily formidable fatties. The sight was truly impressive.These were the nine members of the Ovens, and this was, in fact, their first time attending the trials by fire held for servants at the three Mountain Peaks. Just as they had planned, three of their number went to each of the three mountain peaks.Large groups of servants were hurrying toward the mountain peaks from all directions, cracking their knuckles and looking very excited. Many of these servants had attempted the trials by fire on numerous occasions, only to fail in the end. For others, it was their first time attending. Everyone was both excited and nervous, and hoped that they could be like a galloping divine steed and make a meteoric rise to become an Outer Sect disciple.As they neared the various mountain peaks, they caught sight of the fatties from the Ovens.\u201cThe Ovens? What are they doing here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been a servant for nine years already, and I\u2019ve participated in the trials by fire thirty times. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen anyone from the Ovens here\u2026.\u201d The other servants were shocked, and began to spread word. Soon, everyone was talking about the fact that all three of the mountains had people from the Ovens waiting there for the trials by fire.\u201cThis is big! I can\u2019t believe the Ovens people all are going to vie for a spot in the Outer Sect. What\u2019s going on\u2026?\u201dBai Xiaochun, Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei were all waiting at the bottom of the third peak. When they heard the shocked exclamations of the other servants, they didn\u2019t react at all. In fact, their faces were so calm that it almost seemed they were away on astral journeys and were completely oblivious to all of the conversations around them.They were completely and utterly focused on the trial by fire starting line. To them, this was not the path of a trial by fire; instead, it was a glittering, glowing road to spirit stones.Bai Xiaochun looked especially solemn, with his eyes turned up in thought.Soon, a figure could be seen floating down from the three mountains. The person to land by Bai Xiaochun and the others was a middle-aged man who had the demeanor of a transcendent being. The first thing he noticed as he alighted next to the starting line was the mountain of flesh that was Big Fatty Zhang.Then he looked over at Bai Xiaochun and Third Fatty Hei. This man was the Honor Guard in charge of the trial by fire, and currently, his heart was filled with astonishment.\u201cDid the sun rise from the west today?\u201d he thought. \u201cUsually the people from the Ovens would rather die than become Outer Sect disciples. What\u2019s going on?\u201dAfter blinking a few times to make sure he wasn\u2019t seeing things, an expression of encouragement appeared on the man\u2019s face. He flicked his sleeve and began to speak, his voice echoing out in all directions.\u201cLet the trial by fire for promotion to the Outer Sect\u2026 begin!\u201d As soon as the words left his mouth, bells began to toll throughout the sect. At the same time, the starting lines to the trials by fire lit up, indicating that the event had begun.Instantly, Big Fatty Zhang shot forward, an expression of extreme focus on his face. He kicked up a huge wind as he ran toward the stone steps leading up the mountain, moving so fast you might think he was being chased by a ravenous beast.Third Fatty Hei also leapt into motion behind Big Fatty Zhang, a brutal gleam in his eyes that seemed to indicate that anyone who tried to overtake him on the path was threatening his life.In third place was Bai Xiaochun, who leapt onto the path as quickly as a rabbit, thinking about nothing else but the Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill. In the blink of an eye, the three of them were dashing madly up the path.All of that happened so quickly that the other servants barely had time to react. Their faces immediately fell and, gritting their teeth, they scrambled onto the path and began to climb toward the peak.Similar scenes played out on the other two mountains, with the fatties from the Ovens instantly taking the lead.The third mountain peak was known as Fragrant Cloud Peak, and currently Bai Xiaochun and his companions were flying along the trial by fire path, far ahead of everyone else. However, it didn\u2019t take long before they felt increasing pressure weighing down on them, forcing them to slow their pace.Bai Xiaochun looked around and realized that seven or eight people were closing in behind him. Suddenly, he was filled with a feeling of anxiety; it was as if these people were on the verge of stealing his Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill.\u201cTaking away my Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill is the same as taking away my life!\u201d He suddenly held his breath, causing his face to turn scarlet. Then he sent spiritual energy streaming out into his body, which formed into a powerful, surging force. All of a sudden, he charged forward like wild boar whose tail had just been stepped on. In the blink of an eye, his speed more than doubled, and he had passed Third Fatty Hei and even Big Fatty Zhang.Third Fatty Hei let out a roar, and then used some unknown technique to similarly increase his speed and suddenly pass up Big Fatty Zhang and race closer to Bai Xiaochun. Seeing that he had just been passed by his two companions, Big Fatty Zhang started getting anxious.He took a deep breath and then, all of a sudden, his rolls of fat seemed to shrink. It was almost as if he was burning his fat in exchange for a burst of speed. Rumbling sounds could be heard as he closed the distance between himself and Third Fatty Hei. Soon, all three of them were speeding along rapidly.When the servants behind them saw what was happening, their jaws dropped in shock. Looks of despair appeared on their faces, and yet, they weren\u2019t willing to give up so easily, and pushed onward with all the strength they could muster. Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do to catch up with Bai Xiaochun and the others. Their tempers having reached the limit, they began to cry out curses.\u201cDammit! Are they high on aphrodisiacs or something? How could they be so fast!\u201dSoon, enough time had passed for an incense stick to burn, and Bai Xiaochun had already reached the top of the mountain. In fact, he could even see two Outer Sect disciples standing just beyond the finish line, waiting there to receive the servants.As soon as the two Outer Sect disciples caught sight of Bai Xiaochun, they smiled slightly, and one of them said, \u201cCongratulations, Junior Br\u2013\u201dHowever, before he could even finish speaking, his eyes went wide with shock.Bai Xiaochun barreled along a few more paces, but then screeched to a halt a mere step in front of the finish line.He stood there looking at the Outer Sect disciples, and they looked back at him. Then, he gave them a charming smile, and spun to face the other direction.\u201cStop!\u201d he roared, throwing his hands up into the air. Instantly, Third Fatty Hei and Big Fatty Zhang wheezed to a stop next to him. The three of them stood there looking at each other, breathing heavily. Then, they broke out into laughter.The two Outer Sect disciples exchanged dismayed glances, unsure of what exactly was happening. The fact that these three suddenly stopped running at this point seemed to indicate that they were crazy.\u201cJunior Brothers,\u201d one of the Outer Sect disciples said cautiously, \u201cthe three of you are the first to arrive at the finish line. Just step on over, and you will be promoted into the Outer Sect.\u201d\u201cOuter Sect disciples?\u201d Big Fatty Zhang said, waving his hand dismissively. \u201cWho wants to become Outer Sect disciples?\u201d He continued to stand there along with Third Fatty Hei, two mountains of flesh who completely blocked the exit gate.Bai Xiaochun sat down in front of them, jaw tilted up as he waited, lofty and proud.The two Outer Sect disciples didn\u2019t seem pleased. \u201cHuh? If you don\u2019t want to be Outer Sect disciples, then what are you doing here? Are you people crazy or something?!\u201dBig Fatty Zhang, Third Fatty Hei and Bai Xiaochun pretended not to have heard, and kept their eyes focused further on down the mountain.Soon, enough time had passed for an incense stick to burn. Finally, a long-faced servant struggled up the path, gasping and wheezing. When he saw Bai Xiaochun and the others, he immediately sighed. However, his eyes burned with an unyielding light. This was his ninth time participating in the trial by fire, and this was the first time he\u2019d even come close to winning. But then, along came the people from the Ovens.Looking furious, he was just about to turn to leave when Bai Xiaochun shot to his feet and yelled, \u201cElder Brother, don\u2019t go! Come, come. You know what? I just can\u2019t bear to leave the Ovens. All of a sudden, I don\u2019t want to be an Outer Sect disciple after all. Maybe I should give my spot up\u2026.\u201dThe long-faced servant stared in shock for a moment, and then his eyes began to shine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That was the word that flashed into the mind of the long-faced young man as soon as he heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words. But then he glanced at the mountains of meat sitting there behind him, grinning maliciously, and he hesitated.\u201cYou\u2026.\u201dBai Xiaochun stepped forward with an utterly charming smile, looking like the type of person who wouldn\u2019t harm a fly.

You will soar like a shooting star, your future limitless. However, your Junior Brother here worked really hard to run all the way to the finish line. Don\u2019t you think it would be appropriate to give a little compensation?\u201dThe servant\u2019s face darkened. If he didn\u2019t understand by now what was going on, then he didn\u2019t deserve to have lived for so many years. He looked at Bai Xiaochun, and then at Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei. Then his expression flickered as he rapidly considered the matter, trying to decide if it was worth it.It didn\u2019t take very long before the long-faced young man gritted his teeth and made his decision. If he lost this chance, it might seem like all he was losing was a month of time. However, who knew what other sort of powerful expert would appear during that month. Besides, who was to say whether or not the three people from the Ovens\u2026 might not show up again in the next trial by fire.Most important of all was that this young man was dead set on becoming an Outer Sect disciple, and now, hope had been set down right in front of him. Finally, he stamped his foot.\u201cHow much compensation do you want?\u201d he asked through gritted teeth.Beaming, Bai Xiaochun quickly replied, \u201cNot much, not much. Look, I prepared for several months to participate in this trial by fire. How about we agree to twenty spirit stones? That should be enough.\u201dWhen he heard the number mentioned, the long-faced young man\u2019s heart trembled. He flicked his sleeve, and was just about to refuse, when Bai Xiaochun once again spoke up.\u201cLook, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m being greedy. All three of us are together, you see, so you can\u2019t just think about me. My Eldest Brother and Third Elder Brother both starved themselves and lost a lot of weight for the sake of this trial by fire.\u201dIn that respect, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t lying at all. Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei had both lost quite a bit of fat on their way up the mountain.The long-faced servant eyed Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei, and inwardly began to let loose a torrent of curse words. Then, he started to bargain, and ended up agreeing on sixteen spirit stones. Heart twinging in pain, he finally tossed a bag over to Bai Xiaochun.\u201cAlright?\u201d he asked, his voice hoarse.\u201cWonderful,\u201d replied Bai Xiaochun cheerily. \u201cOkay, Elder Brother, please wait off to the side for a moment. Once we have two more takers, we\u2019ll open the way to the exit gate.\u201d Bai Xiaochun tossed the spirit stones to Big Fatty Zhang.When the long-faced servant realized that they were going to wait for two more people to come, anticipation suddenly welled up in his heart. It was a situation of \u201cif I get screwed, you better not have a smile on your face.\u201dBy this point, the two Outer Sect disciples on the other side of the exit gate realized what was going on, and their eyes were wide with disbelief.\u201cWh-what are you people doing?\u201d one of them shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re actually selling spots in the Outer Sect? What gall!\u201dBig Fatty Zhang was elatedly counting the spirit stones when he heard the Outer Sect disciples. Looking irritated, he turned to glare at them. \u201cWhat are you hollering for? It was tiring reaching this point, and now I don\u2019t feel like going any further. Don\u2019t tell me we\u2019re not allowed to let other fellow disciples continue on past us? If they want to give us some compensation for our efforts, what\u2019s so wrong with that, huh?\u201dThe two Outer Sect disciples weren\u2019t really sure how to respond to such a statement.It was at this point that seven or eight flushed faces could be seen hurrying up the path. The sound of their gasping pants rang out almost like thunder. In the lead position was a burly man of about thirty years of age. He was bare-chested, and looked very impressive as he strode up to the top of the mountain. Bai Xiaochun immediately stepped forward, eyes gleaming.\u201cYou\u2019re a bit late, Elder Brother. However, I suddenly don\u2019t want to become an Outer Sect disciple. Would you like my spot?\u201dThe burly man stared in shock, then turned back to look at all the other servants coming up the mountain behind him. Then he snorted coldly and said, \u201cYou think you can extort money from me, you little brat? Beat it!\u201dRoaring, the man waved his arm, causing the spirit pressure of the third level of Qi Condensation to surge out.Bai Xiaochun backed up a pace and shouted, \u201cEldest Brother!\u201dAlmost immediately, a mountain of flesh descended from above.The burly man\u2019s face fell as he looked up. Then, a huge boom rang out as the mountain of flesh smashed into him.The burly man let out a miserable shriek as Big Fatty Zhang proceeded to sit down on top of him. Although he struggled, it was impossible for him to free himself. In fact, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was so big and strong to begin with, the air would have been squeezed out of his lungs, and he would have fainted.When the seven or so servants coming up the mountain behind the burly man saw what was happening, their eyes went wide with shock.The two Outer Sect disciples also gasped. The burly man stuck under Big Fatty Zhang almost seemed to be deflating, and they couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit sorry for him.Eyes darting about, Bai Xiaochun leaned over and whispered, \u201cEldest Brother, we have an audience.\u201dHaving known Bai Xiaochun for over a year now, Big Fatty Zhang understood exactly what he meant. Glaring down at the burly man, he clenched his massive hands into hammer-like fists and then began to beat him soundly.\u201cHow dare you try to freeload off of Grandpa Fatty! What brazen gall!\u201cIt was really hard to climb all the way up here. We wanted to become Outer Sect disciples, but just happened to give up at the last minute. Of course we want some compensation!\u201cFudge, I can\u2019t believe you refused us!\u201d After beating him for a bit, Big Fatty Zhang then jumped back up into the air and then slammed down onto the man. The burly man was shrieking miserably, and could barely breathe. Then Big Fatty Zhang prepared to jump up again, and the man suddenly held a bag out in a shaking hand. Face filled with terror, he blurted, \u201cHere, take some compensation!\u201dBig Fatty Zhang immediately helped the burly man to his feet. Face beaming, he took the bag, glanced inside, then helped the man dust off his clothes.\u201cHahaha. Why didn\u2019t you say so earlier, bro? Look, people are already lining up ahead of you. All we need is one more and we\u2019ll open the path.\u201dThe burly man looked both humiliated and enraged, but didn\u2019t dare to say anything. He stalked over to stand next to the long-faced servant, feeling incredibly depressed. As for the long-faced servant, he already felt a little better, and couldn\u2019t help but feel that he was smarter than this burly fellow.\u201cThat was incredible, Eldest Brother!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, grinning from ear to ear. Then he looked over excitedly at the other servants who had been following the burly man, but were now standing there looking terrified.Big Fatty Zhang smiled proudly, then walked back to his place by the entrance, where he sat down again to block the way.The two Outer Sect disciples exchanged dismayed glances. Compared to what had just happened now, the way Bai Xiaochun and the others had extorted the long-faced servant almost seemed mild and gentle.\u201cThey\u2019re\u2026 they\u2019re actually robbing people!!\u201d\u201cThis is robbery!\u201d They were infuriated, but also a little bit jealous, and couldn\u2019t help but wish they had come up with a similar idea back when they had been participating in the trial by fire.Most conflicted of all were the seven servants who had been following close behind the burly man. As they watched Big Fatty Zhang crushing and beating the burly man, their eyes began to shine with a bright light.Previously, becoming an Outer Sect disciple had almost seemed like an impossibility. But now\u2026 they all of a sudden had hope.Looking around excitedly at all the people, Bai Xiaochun suddenly cried out in a high-pitched voice: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, there\u2019s one spot left. How about this, we\u2019ll give it to the highest bidder!\u201dImmediately, the crowd of people realized what was happening, and the sound of their panting grew even louder.The looks in their eyes became even stranger, and their hearts filled with all sorts of wild possibilities. Almost immediately, people began crying out bids, making it seem almost like an auction.\u201cI\u2019ll bid ten spirit stones!\u201d\u201cEleven!\u201d\u201cThat spot belongs to me. I\u2019ll bid fifteen spirit stones!\u201dBai Xiaochun, Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei were instantly elated.When the two Outer Sect disciples heard what was going on, it was like pouring oil onto a fire. From their perspective, extortion was one thing, and robbery could potentially be overlooked. But to see the situation turning into an auction left their minds spinning. It was so outrageous that waves of shock seemed to batter their hearts. To them, the most villainous among the three wasn\u2019t Big Fatty Zhang, but rather, the seemingly charming and innocent Bai Xiaochun!\u201cOutrageous! Shameless!\u201d One of them finally gritted his teeth and spun around, eyes bloodshot with either jealousy or fury, he wasn\u2019t sure which, as he went to report the matter to the Honor Guard.Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t actually very pleased with the level of bids being called out. His eyes turned up in thought for a moment, and then he cried out, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we need to hurry things up. Otherwise, other servants are going to show up, and then who knows what lengths they\u2019ll go to in order to win!\u201dIn response to his words, the voice of a young woman suddenly called out from further back down the mountain.\u201cI, Hou Xiaomei, bid thirty spirit stones! I come from a cultivator clan and have tons of money. Let\u2019s see who dares to try to steal my spot!\u201d A pretty young girl huffed and puffed her way up the mountain. She had white skin and a slim frame, and looked quite young.When Big Fatty Zhang saw the pretty young girl, his eyes went wide. He was just about to say something, but stopped himself and looked over at Bai Xiaochun.Almost as soon as Hou Xiaomei\u2019s words left her mouth, the rest of the servants were thrown into a huge commotion, calling out increasingly high bids. In the end, she named a price that left the horse-faced youth and the burly man trembling in fear. In fact, they even felt like they had just gotten a huge deal.Hou Xiaomei strode out from the crowd, her ample chest leading the way. She looked back scornfully at everyone else, then joined the long-faced young man and the burly fellow, who called himself Lord Wolf. Together, they walked up to the final step and then exited the trial by fire.Behind them, Bai Xiaochun, Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei clasped hands and bowed deeply.\u201cCongratulations, Fellow Daoists. You are the fish who leaped over the dragon gate, you are galloping divine steeds!\u201dThe long-faced servant and the others stood there at the top of the mountain, somewhat in a daze. Although they were now Outer Sect disciples, for some reason, it wasn\u2019t as joyous of an occasion as they had imagined. Then they heard the words uttered by Bai Xiaochun and the others, and the long-faced young man and the burly servant exchanged rueful, bitter glances.Hou Xiaomei, on the other hand, seemed extremely excited. Her charming face was even a bit flushed.\u201cI never thought that I, Hou Xiaomei, would ever encounter such luck,\u201d she thought proudly.\u2014\u2013As luck would have it, just a few hours before the posting of this chapter, Er Gen released a new official depiction of Hou Xiaomei. Here it is:http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hou_xiaomei.jpgPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 12: On the Bamboo FencePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 12: On the Bamboo FenceAnd thus, the trial by fire concluded. As Hou Xiaomei walked further up the mountain, Big Fatty Zhang looked at her and rubbed his chin thoughtfully.\u201cAh, so fair, so young, so pure\u2026.\u201d he said. Then he looked over at Bai Xiaochun, as if he were comparing the two of them. 1Bai Xiaochun was also staring at Hou Xiaomei as she walked off into the distance, his heart filled with conflicting emotions. Then he heard Big Fatty Zhang, and turned to find him looking at him out of the corner of his eye.\u201cHey, what are you looking at!?\u201d he yelled.Big Fatty Zhang laughed loudly at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s anger, then pulled out the bag of spirit stones and quickly changed the topic.\u201cCome, come, why don\u2019t we count our spirit stones? We\u2019re rich now! Hahaha! This really was a great idea.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the point in counting them?\u201d replied Bai Xiaochun with a cold harrumph. \u201cNo matter how many times you do it, it won\u2019t change how many there are.\u201d\u201cNinth Junior Brother, you don\u2019t understand. What you\u2019re looking at is just spirit stones, but what you\u2019re counting is\u2026 life.\u201d Big Fatty Zhang rarely spoke of the profundities of life. To hear him speak in such a way left Bai Xiaochun shocked. He took the bag and tried to count the spirit stones the way Big Fatty Zhang would, but quickly got bored and handed the bag back.It was at about this time that glittering light rose up along the trial by fire path. Everyone\u2019s vision swam, and when it became clear again, they were back at the bottom of the mountain.When the middle-aged Honor Guard who was in charge of the trial by fire saw Bai Xiaochun and the others, a strange expression appeared on his face. After a moment, he shook his head and ignored them. As far as he was concerned, the sect would have to figure out what to do with the Ovens.Bai Xiaochun and the others were nervous, but seeing that there were no immediate repercussions, they exchanged glances, cleared their throats, and quickly headed back to the Ovens.Big Fatty Zhang kept counting the spirit stones over and over again, all the way until they were back at the Ovens. The other fatties soon returned, also elated. Everyone exchanged glances, and then looked extremely proud of themselves.After the loot had been split up, Bai Xiaochun went back to his hut. He had come to this place seeking to live forever. Were it not for the fact that he needed the medicinal plants to exchange for an Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill, he would never have even thought for a moment about spirit stones.That night, nobody in the Ovens could sleep. Big Fatty Zhang and the others were simply too excited from getting rich all of a sudden. In the past, their coin purses had been depressingly empty, but now, the future seemed bright and glorious. That having been said, they were still worried about the possible repercussions of what they had done, making it difficult for them to fall asleep.As for Bai Xiaochun, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill, and was equally unable to fall asleep.The next day, the news about the Ovens blocking the path during the trial by fire spread like wildfire through the entire servants\u2019 district on the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect. Soon, everybody had heard.\u201cDid you hear what the Ovens crew did?!?!\u201d\u201cAre they crazy? I can\u2019t believe they did that! Heavens! They sold spots into the Outer Sect! Outrageous! How come I never thought to do that?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the people from the Ovens have important backgrounds and are really well connected in the sect. Otherwise, how could they dare to do something so infuriating!?\u201d All departments and individuals in the servants\u2019 district were talking about the Ovens.In the following days, the crew tried to keep a low profile, and even avoided going out alone. One evening several days later, Bai Xiaochun was ladling soup out into one thick-bottomed bowl after another. Suddenly, he heard the sounds of footsteps coming from the path outside.\u201cEveryone from the Ovens get out here immediately! The Supervisor\u2019s Department has received orders to investigate your role in what happened during the trials by fire!\u201d Even as the voice called out, the main gate of the Ovens was kicked in loudly.The sound of the door being kicked open echoed out as several servants burst in, all of them wearing the robes of the Supervisor\u2019s Department. Leading them all was none other than the burly man who had come last time with Xu Baocai.Big Fatty Zhang and Bai Xiaochun exchanged a glance, then walked out nonchalantly to face the combative group from the Supervisors Department.\u201cI thought I heard the crows squawking this morning,\u201d Big Fatty Zhang said. \u201cI should have known that you would be showing up today, Chen Fei.\u201dChen Fei laughed coldly as he looked first at Big Fatty Zhang and then at Bai Xiaochun. Their completely calm demeanor caused him to frown.On the way, he had been extremely excited, having believed himself to have finally gained the advantage he needed to be able to take down the Ovens, to put an end to the animosity that had existed for years between their two departments.\u201cQuit pretending to be so calm!\u201d Chen Fei said with a cold, eerie laugh. His eyes flickered with a fierce light. \u201cPeople of the Ovens, allow me to ask, did the nine of you attend the most recent trial by fire for servant promotion to the Outer Sect?\u201d\u201cSure did,\u201d Big Fatty Zhang replied, chuckling.\u201cThat\u2019s all I need to know. Take them away!\u201d Chen Fei didn\u2019t mince his words. He waved his right index finger, and immediately, a dozen or so servants from the Supervisor\u2019s Department quickly hurried out with iron manacles to arrest the Ovens staff.Seeing this, Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but laugh and say, \u201cIs your Supervisor\u2019s Department in charge of everything? You can even disqualify us from being able to become Outer Sect disciples? You guys are pretty powerful.\u201dChen Fei couldn\u2019t help but think of the recent incident with the flying sword. He held his hand out to stop the other servants, then looked at Bai Xiaochun with narrowed eyes.\u201cJunior Brother Bai, if you\u2019re still not convinced of my authority, then answer me another question. Did you Ovens people block the exit of the trial by fire and then sell spots in the Outer Sect? Do you dare to admit that you did such a thing?!\u201d\u201cOf course I admit it!\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied with a calm nod, looking quite charming. He even pointed at Big Fatty Zhang and the others and said, \u201cSo do they.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, we all do. So what?!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang said with a hearty laugh.Chen Fei\u2019s face flickered. He had never imagined that the Ovens staff would actually admit to the allegations. He had expected them to give in only after a bitter and protracted battle of wits.The way things were playing out seemed strange, and an odd feeling was growing inside of him. Therefore, it was without another word that he growled, \u201cExcellent. Since you admit it, then it saves me having to ask more questions. You\u2019re going to come with me to the Court Hall. If any of you dare to resist us, then in accord with the sect rules, you\u2019ll be immediately expelled!\u201dWith that, he flew forward toward Bai Xiaochun, followed by the rest of his group.However, it was at this point that Bai Xiaochun suddenly extended his right hand and performed an incantation gesture. Immediately, a beam of sword light shot out from his sleeve, transforming into a colorful wooden sword. The instant the sword appeared between the two groups, it let off an oppressively cold glow. Chen Fei stopped in his tracks, his face falling.\u201cBai Xiaochun, how dare you resist arrest!\u201d\u201cElder Brother Chen, the Supervisor\u2019s Department might have the right to question us, but where did you get the right to arrest us?\u201d\u201cHmph! What you admitted to violates sect rules, of course I have the right to arrest you!\u201d\u201cWait, what sect rule did we violate?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked with narrowed eyes. Big Fatty Zhang and the others also looked at Chen Fei with narrowed eyes and cold smiles.\u201cYou sold a spot into the Outer Sect, which violates sect rule number\u2026 wait, huh?\u201d Suddenly, Chen Fei stopped speaking, and his face fell. Beads of sweat popped out on his forehead.It was only at this point that he suddenly realized that there was actually no sect rule specifically forbidding people from selling spots into the Outer Sect while on the path of the trial by fire\u2026. After all, not many people would think to do such a thing, and even if they did, they would likely not have the gumption to go through with the plan\u2026.\u201cElder Brother Chen, why are you sweating?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked, sounding flabbergasted. However, as he spoke, his words grew louder and louder. \u201cCome on, what rule was it that we violated? Just say it. Wait, could it be that we didn\u2019t violate any sect rules? Elder Brother Chen, did you trick the Court Hall into carrying out your own personal vendetta? Is that why you came here to punish us? Elder Brother Chen, what you are doing is a violation of volume nine statute number eleven of the sect rules! That comes with a heavy punishment!\u201d By the end of his speech, he felt great.\u201cLiar! I\u2026.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just Chen Fei\u2019s face who fell. All of the other servants from the Supervisor\u2019s Department all realized that a huge mistake had been made.It was at this point that Big Fatty Zhang smiled viciously, lifted up both hands, and cracked his knuckles. Fierce gleams appeared in the eyes of the other fatties as they began to walk toward the group from the Supervisor\u2019s Department.\u201cChen Fei, the Court Hall will deal with your violation of sect rules,\u201d said Big Fatty Zhang with a vicious grin, his energy surging. \u201cBut right now, you had better explain how you\u2019re going to compensate for the Ovens\u2019 cherished main gate, which was painstakingly forged by the hands of numerous past ancestors who died in the process!\u201dSince they had dared to block the finish line of the trial by fire, they had naturally done so after being fully prepared. Bai Xiaochun had suggested early on that they research the sect rules before enacting their huge plan.\u201cCharge!\u201d cried Big Fatty Zhang. His mountain-like figure immediately caused Chen Fei and the others to begin to tremble.Instantly, the clashing and clanging sounds of battle rang out in the courtyard. As for Bai Xiaochun, his body flashed through the air as he alighted on his usual spot atop the bamboo fence which surrounded the courtyard. He flicked his sleeve and clasped his hands behind his back. Looking off into the distance, he looked every bit the lonely hero who didn\u2019t deign to participate in the fighting.\u201cI, Bai Xiaochun, can exterminate the Supervisor\u2019s Department in the twinkling of an eye\u2026.\u201d1. In describing Hou Xiaomei, Big Fatty Zhang uses the same characters that make up Bai Xiaochun\u2019s namePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was a lot of friction between the two, but usually things were kept under control. The worst that ever happened were minor injuries.The battle over the trial by fire went on for the time it takes an incense stick to burn. Big Fatty Zhang and the others beat Chen Fei and the Supervisor\u2019s Department squad until they were black and blue. Only when they forked over enough spirit stones to pay for the main gate were they allowed to leave, cursing the entire time.Before departing, Chen Fei looked over at Bai Xiaochun standing there on the bamboo fence, and the hatred in his heart grew deeper. As far as he was concerned, ever since Bai Xiaochun showed up, the Ovens had only become more and more repulsive.The fight had attracted quite a bit of attention in the servants\u2019 district. Many of the servants, upon realizing that the Supervisor\u2019s Department could do nothing to the Ovens, were angrier than ever. However, other servants were like Hou Xiaomei, and felt that what the Ovens had done meant that they would now have a good opportunity in the trials by fire.In fact, when the trials by fire started the following month, the Ovens crew proudly made their way to the starting line.The surrounding servants looked at them furiously.Big Fatty Zhang cleared his throat, looked around at the other servants, and said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, if you get to the top more quickly than us, then you won\u2019t have to buy a spot. We\u2019re doing this for the good of the sect! A good struggle will bring out the best of the best!\u201dHe had been instructed by Bai Xiaochun to word things in such a way, and the result was that the surrounding servants clenched their jaws in anger.When the bells began to toll, and the trial by fire began, the Ovens crew, as well as all the other servants, began to race up the mountain as if their lives depended on it.Soon, the fatties and Bai Xiaochun were so far ahead they couldn\u2019t even be seen. The other servants smiled bitterly, but continued on with the race.Apparently, they had taken Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s words to heart\u2026.Yet again, the Ovens crew succeeded in spectacular fashion, which caused a huge commotion in the servants\u2019 district. After all, they had profound cultivation bases, and their physical frames were enormous. No one dared to say anything.The Ovens was now more in the spotlight than they had ever been. Although they were well known in the servants\u2019 district, their current fame surpassed anything from past years.Another two months passed, and whenever there were trials by fire, the Ovens crew quickly hurried over. As far as they were concerned, that time of the month was their spirit stone payday.Bai Xiaochun was also excited by the buildup of spirit stones. He would soon have enough to buy all of the medicinal plants he needed. Eventually, yet another round of trials by fire began.It was currently dawn. Big Fatty Zhang, Third Fatty Hei, and all the other fatties woke up early. Bai Xiaochun joined them, and the nine of them sped along, then split into three groups, with the group led by Big Fatty Zhang heading toward Fragrant Cloud Peak.However, a group from the Supervisor\u2019s Department intercepted them en route. No explanations were given, and fighting broke out immediately. The Supervisor\u2019s Department held the advantage in terms of numbers, leading to a chaotic battle. Soon, the toll of bells could be heard, causing Big Fatty Zhang to grow so anxious that his eyes were shot with blood.As soon as the sound of the bells could be heard, the group from the Supervisor\u2019s Department scattered. Big Fatty Zhang, Bai Xiaochun and Third Fatty Hei were incensed, but had no time to give chase. They immediately sped toward the trial by fire on Fragrant Cloud Peak. When they arrived at the entrance of the path, nobody was there, so they instantly began to race up the mountain.\u201cThose Supervisor\u2019s Department bastards!\u201d cursed Big Fatty Zhang. \u201cJust wait until we\u2019re done here, I\u2019ll call all the Junior Brothers together and we\u2019ll go beat the crap out of \u2018em!\u201d He was pushing so hard that the fat in his body was burning away, making him visibly thinner. However, the result was explosive speed.Bai Xiaochun was also furious. He only needed a few more spirit stones to reach his goal. Gritting his teeth, he pushed forward with all the speed he could muster. Keeping pace with Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei, he shot up the path, passing one servant after another.As soon as they reached the top of the mountain, their faces darkened. Standing there at the peak, blocking the entrance, were three people.Standing up front was Chen Fei, flanked by two burly men who appeared to be at the third level of Qi Condensation. As soon as they saw Bai Xiaochun and the others, they started laughing uproariously.\u201cBig Fatty Zhang and Bai Xiaochun are here! Well, don\u2019t worry, we still have spots left. You want one?\u201dBig Fatty Zhang gritted his teeth. Eyes bloodshot, he yelled, \u201cDespicable! Shameless! You flunkies!\u201d\u201cHey, since this isn\u2019t breaking sect rules, then if you people from the Ovens can come here, then so can the Supervisor\u2019s Department!\u201d\u201cHahaha! This business belongs to the Supervisor\u2019s Department now!\u201dWhen Bai Xiaochun and the others heard the mocking laughter of Chen Fei and his friends, their rage burned. Now it was obvious why the others from the Supervisor\u2019s Department had ambushed them on the way here. It was all a big plot!Big Fatty Zhang let out a bellow of rage and was just about to attack Chen Fei. As far as he was concerned, a fight at this point was unavoidable. Furthermore, he had no way of knowing how often the same thing would happen again in the future. It was essentially the same as stealing spirit stones from him, which caused his fury to bubble and boil.Third Fatty Hei was equally enraged. However, in the same moment that the two of them were about to attack, Bai Xiaochun looked up in thought and then suddenly whispered, \u201cEldest Brother, run as fast as you can and then push them over the finish line. We might not get any spirit stones this time, but at least the Supervisor\u2019s Department won\u2019t be able to steal our business in the future!\u201dBig Fatty Zhang\u2019s eyes immediately went wild with joy. More than ever, he realized how much of a villain Bai Xiaochun was. Laughing heartily, he suddenly shot forward. Third Fatty Hei followed Big Fatty Zhang, chuckling, eyes shining.The path wasn\u2019t very wide, and when Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei charged forward together, they were almost like a huge wall.A wind kicked up as they sped directly toward Chen Fei and the others.Bai Xiaochun followed behind Big Fatty Zhang, letting out a wild whoop.Without the slightest hesitation, Chen Fei and his friends attacked. However, it did no good. Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei were charging forward like startled wild boars.Their dual attack was shocking enough to make ghosts and gods weep. They charged madly forward, slamming into Chen Fei and his friends, forcing them back. Chen Fei and his friends were completely shocked, and when they realized what the Ovens crew was doing, their scalps felt like they were about to explode.In any other situation, Chen Fei and his friends would dodge to the side or counterattack. But here, fleeing backward would do no good, and would in fact hasten their defeat.As they were pushed back, their faces filled with fury.Obviously, they had no desire to become Outer Sect disciples. After being promoted, they would no longer be in the Supervisor\u2019s Department, and would become ordinary disciples again, losing access to their ill-gotten gains.\u201cElder Brother Zhang, stop it!\u201d blurted Chen Fei, sweat pouring down his forehead. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to say\u2013\u201d However, before he could finish, he was interrupted by Bai Xiaochun.\u201cEldest Brother, keep going! Push them over the finish line!\u201dIn response, Big Fatty Zhang let out a roar and pushed forward even harder. Third Fatty Hei joined him, and rumbling sounds echoed out as they shoved Chen Fei and two other burly fellows down the narrow path. The first to cross the finish line was one of the burly men, who then stood there at the top of the mountain, wanting to cry, but unable to.The other burly fellow let out a miserable scream. Staggering backward, he began to beat his chest in regret.Last to cross over was Chen Fei. No matter how he struggled, the path was too narrow, and a boom could be heard as he was forced off the path. He glared back at Big Fatty Zhang and the others, eyes bloodshot and filled with murder.\u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201d The person they hated the most wasn\u2019t Big Fatty Zhang, but rather Bai Xiaochun, who had come up with the despicable plan to begin with.The two Outer Sect disciples at the top of the mountain had been watching as the whole scene played out. They cleared their throats, and then backed up a bit, having nothing to say.Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei now stood at the finish line, sticking their chests out in pride and laughing heartily.\u201cSee you later, Chen Fei!\u201d said Big Fatty Zhang, slapping his stomach and causing the fat to jiggle. \u201cHahaha! Although, not in the servants\u2019 district! Hahaha! I\u2019ll miss you! Congratulations on becoming an Outer Sect disciple!\u201dChen Fei and his friends very nearly coughed up blood, and in their hearts, they wanted nothing more than to commit murder.Bai Xiaochun stuck out his lower jaw, looking very pleased. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank us, Elder Brothers. Congratulations on becoming the fish which leaped over the dragon gate. As Outer Sect disciples, your meteoric success will be like the galloping divine steed. We Junior Brothers offer sincere congratulations!\u201dHowever, even as his words rang out, a cold harrumph rang out from the top of Fragrant Cloud Peak.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for congratulations, you\u2019re coming too.\u201dAlmost as soon as the words entered Bai Xiaochun\u2019s ears, he began to tremble. His eyes filled with fear as a powerful force surged down from further up the mountain, enveloped him, and then began to pull up the mountain.Bai Xiaochun let out a miserable shriek, and quickly latched his arms around a tree that bordered the trial by fire.\u201cElder Brothers, save me!\u201d he screamed.This development occurred too quickly. Before Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei could even react, a cracking sound could be heard as the tree Bai Xiaochun was holding on to split in half. He flew backward like a kite with its string cut, spinning upward toward the top of the mountain. At the same time, a middle-aged man appeared up above, wearing a long blue cloak, looking very threatening despite not looking angry. It was none other than\u2026Li Qinghou.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Third Elder Sister?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14: Third Elder Brother? Third Elder Sister?Chen Fei and his friends were always happy to gloat in the misfortune of others. As they watched what was happening to Bai Xiaochun, they couldn\u2019t help but feel as if the grand laws of Heaven were truly being enforced implacably. As for the two Outer Sect disciples in charge of the trial by fire, they looked on with hatred, a sensation that no other servant had ever caused them to feel.\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun plopped onto the ground and immediately began to wail, his voice filled with such a feeling of being abused that any listener would surely weep.Simultaneously, back down on the path, Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei saw Li Qinghou and began to quiver. They quickly bowed their heads to avoid notice.\u201cAh, Ninth Junior Brother, it\u2019s not that I refused to save you. Now that the Peak Lord of Fragrant Cloud Peak has shown up, you have no choice but to suck it up in the Outer Sect\u2026.\u201d Big Fatty Zhang heaved continuous sighs in his heart as he hunched his shoulders and tried to inconspicuously scuttle away. However, it was at that point that Li Qinghou\u2019s voice suddenly rang in his ears.\u201cYou two are coming along as well.\u201d As soon as Big Fatty Zhang heard the words, a powerful force dragged both him and Third Fatty Hei up into the air. They didn\u2019t even have a chance to grab onto a tree before they were hauled to the top of the mountain.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang wailed, sounding even more miserable than Bai Xiaochun. \u201cI\u2019d rather die in the Ovens than climb the ladder in the Outer Sect\u2026.\u201d He sounded so miserable, in fact, that Bai Xiaochun looked up in surprise and forgot to cry.Third Fatty Hei didn\u2019t say anything, but instead looked silently down toward the bottom of the mountain, his face a picture of depression and longing.When Li Qinghou heard Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s miserable wailing, his face darkened and he said, \u201cShut up!\u201dInstantly, Bai Xiaochun rose to his feet, face solemn as he stood there. Instead of looking sullen like he had before, he was the complete opposite, as if he had suddenly switched faces.Big Fatty Zhang stared in shock, and then immediately stood up. Inwardly, he felt as if the persecution he was enduring was like an ocean that threatened to overwhelm him. He just couldn\u2019t figure out why Li Qinghou wouldn\u2019t say anything when Bai Xiaochun wailed, and then yelled at him when he did the same thing.\u201cZhang Dahai, starting today, you\u2019ll be an Outer Sect disciple of Violet Cauldron Peak! 1\u201cChen Qingrou, you\u2019ll be going to Green Crest Peak! 2\u201cBai Xiaochun, you\u2019ll be staying here with me, as an Outer Sect disciple of Fragrant Cloud Peak.\u201d Li Qinghou looked at Bai Xiaochun and felt a headache coming on. He had just gone into secluded meditation when he got the news about the Ovens crew and everything that was going on. Even the sect Elders were talking about it. Of course, from their perspective, the whole thing was quite amusing, and a nice break from the monotony of cultivation. None of them were even inclined to dole out any punishment.However, it wasn\u2019t something that could be allowed to go on indefinitely, so Li Qinghou came to straighten matters out.After he finished speaking, he flicked his sleeve, ignoring Chen Fei and the other two men as he looked at something further up on Fragrant Cloud Peak.Bai Xiaochun sighed bitterly and said his goodbyes to Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei. All of a sudden, he remembered something. He turned his head to look at Third Fatty Hei, a strange expression on his face as he asked, \u201cThird Elder Brother, your name\u2026 is actually Chen Qingrou? Hahaha! What a good name. It makes you sound like a smoking hot babe!\u201dThird Fatty Hei gave a cold but depressed snort, then turned and began to walk down the mountain.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked, looking at Big Fatty Zhang.Big Fatty Zhang looked back at him with a strange look in his eyes. Then, he clapped him on the shoulder and spoke, his voice solemn and sincere.\u201cNinth Junior Brother, there\u2019s something I never told you before. Third Fatty Hei actually isn\u2019t your Elder Brother. In fact\u2026 she\u2019s your Elder Sister.\u201d Clearing his throat, he turned and hurried off.Bai Xiaochun stared at him blankly. It felt like thunder was crashing around inside his head, as if the whole world were collapsing.\u201cElder\u2026 Elder Sister?\u201d After a long moment passed, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and was about to turn and look at Third Fatty Hei, when suddenly Li Qinghou\u2019s cold voice rang out.\u201cQuit running your mouth and catch up! \u201dBai Xiaochun hurried after Li Qinghou, looking more bitter than ever. After a few paces, he turned, looked back down at the Ovens, and sighed.It had been quite a while since Bai Xiaochun learned that the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s north bank had four mountain peaks, and that the south bank had three. Li Qinghou was the Peak Lord of the third mountain, Fragrant Cloud Peak. The position of Peak Lord was very distinguished in the sect.Although Fragrant Cloud Peak didn\u2019t look very big, upon entering it, one would realize that it was filled with the singing of birds and the fragrant aroma of flowers. It looked like a celestial paradise, and was actually much larger on the inside than it appeared to be from the outside.Actually, the finish line of the trial by fire was only the peak of one of the auxiliary spurs of the mountain as a whole, and really only counted as the foot of the mountain.Mist swirled about everywhere, as well as an occasional medicinal aroma, a single whiff of which would lift the spirits and send a warm feeling through the body. Bai Xiaochun could immediately tell that this place was extraordinary. He took a deep breath, and his cultivation base, which hadn\u2019t made much progress in the past months, instantly surged to life.Li Qinghou didn\u2019t look back, but his eyes gleamed with a bit of admiration. Even he felt that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s progress in cultivation in the past year wasn\u2019t bad.\u201cNow that you\u2019re an Outer Sect disciple, you can\u2019t go and cause any more trouble,\u201d Li Qinghou said slowly. \u201cPracticing cultivation is like rowing a boat against the current. It requires constant effort.\u201dBai Xiaochun didn\u2019t dare say anything back. He put on the most charming expression he could, and nodded continuously.\u201cSect resources are only one aspect of cultivation for Outer Sect disciples,\u201d Li Qinghou continued. \u201cYou also need to work hard and take advantage of whatever opportunities come your way. There are plenty of missions that you can take on for the sect. In a moment, you can go look at the missions and pick a few to start your training.\u201dWhen Bai Xiaochun heard that, his heart suddenly thumped. A while back when flipping through the sect rules, he had noticed one particular rule about Outer Sect disciple being required to accomplish at least one mission every so often. If they didn\u2019t, they would be punished by being demoted from Outer Sect disciple to servant.He immediately went wild with joy. However, Li Qinghou had apparently realized what he was thinking, and coolly said, \u201cDon\u2019t go thinking about breaking the sect rules. Other people might be demoted to servant for not accomplishing missions, but if you try something like that, I\u2019ll expel you from the sect and return you to your village. A hundred years from now I might even burn some incense for you, if I haven\u2019t forgotten about you by then.\u201dThat frightened Bai Xiaochun half to death. If he had never seen this world of Immortals, it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad. But now that he was on the way to living forever, he had no desire at all to go back to his village. If that happened, he might as well forget about trying to live forever. He quickly smacked himself in the chest and told himself that he would definitely go and accomplish some missions.Soon, they were in the middle section of Fragrant Cloud Peak. A building appeared out of the mists, not very large, but very elegant-looking. Visible through one of the windows was a young man, who sat there quietly reading a book.As if having sensed someone approaching, the young man looked up, revealing a handsome-looking face. When he saw Li Qinghou, he immediately walked out of the building and clasped hands in greeting.\u201cDisciple offers greetings, Peak Lord.\u201d\u201cThis is disciple Bai Xiaochun. Take him and get him set up as an Outer Sect disciple.\u201d Li Qinghou gave Bai Xiaochun a final look before transforming into a beam of prismatic light that shot further up the mountain.Now that Li Qinghou was gone, Bai Xiaochun could heave a sigh of relief. All of a sudden, he felt as if a weight had been lifted off of his shoulders, and the sky was now blue again.The young man measured Bai Xiaochun up, then laughed.\u201cAh, are you the guy who\u2019s been blocking the trial by fire and selling spots? It\u2019s\u2026 Bai Xiaochun, right?\u201dBai Xiaochun chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re praising me for nothing, Elder Brother. A small thing like that isn\u2019t even worth mentioning.\u201dThe young man laughed even harder at that. Clearly, he was very amused by Bai Xiaochun. Dropping the topic, he began to lead Bai Xiaochun around Fragrant Cloud Peak, pointing out some of the important buildings along the way.\u201cFragrant Cloud Peak occupies an important position on the south bank. Green Crest Peak is known for its sword cultivators, Violet Cauldron Peak for their magical techniques. As for the Fragrant Cloud Peak, we excel in concocting spirit medicines.\u201cFragrant Cloud Peak is famous even among the Four Great Sects on this branch of the Heavenspan River. That\u2019s especially true of his excellency the Peak Lord, who is one of the two most famous apothecaries in the Eastwood Continent.\u201cTherefore, becoming an Outer Sect disciple of Fragrant Cloud Peak also makes you an apprentice apothecary. That means you need to study about plants and vegetation, as well as different medicine synthesizing techniques.\u201d The young man continued to provide even more detailed explanations to Bai Xiaochun as they walked along. Eventually, they reached the location where Bai Xiaochun received his Outer Sect disciple clothing and equipment, including a bag of holding.Although the bag of holding didn\u2019t fit much inside, Bai Xiaochun found the thing to be marvelous. After testing it out a few times, he put it away as carefully as if it were a precious treasure.What delighted him more than anything else was that getting promoted to Outer Sect disciple also came with a reward of twenty spirit stones. Now, he had just enough to buy the medicinal plants he needed.Soon it was dusk. Thanks to the explanations provided by the young man, Bai Xiaochun now knew a lot about Fragrant Cloud Peak. Eventually, the young man led him to a place called the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion.From there, he received a jade slip.\u201cThis jade slip describes 10,000 types of plants and vegetation. You need to memorize all of them, and then you can get the second jade slip.\u201cJunior Brother Bai, the path of cultivation is a long one, and spirit medicines are an aid that you can\u2019t do without. If you can become an apothecary, you\u2019ll be able to achieve a meteoric rise here.\u201cApprentice apothecary, journeyman apothecary, master apothecary\u2026.\u201d the young man said with a smile. \u201cJunior Brother Bai, your future progress will all depend on what good fortune you encounter.\u201d By the time night fell, the young man had led him to the courtyard dwelling the sect had arranged as his residence.\u201cJunior Brother Bai, I have to head off the mountain tomorrow, so I won\u2019t be able to accompany you to the Scripture Pavilion. Go there at dawn to get the rest of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art mnemonics. You\u2019ll also be able to pick one more magical technique from the selection they have there. It\u2019s a good opportunity to get some things for free. After that, you\u2019ll have to pay merit points for any magical techniques you want.\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t understand, you can always come looking for me. My name is Hou Yunfei. Many thanks for taking care of Xiaomei for me.\u201d Hou Yunfei smiled, clasped hands and bowed. Then he turned and walked away.\u201cHou Yunfei?\u201d Bai Xiaochun returned the bow and watched Hou Yunfei walking off. After a moment of thought, he recalled the face of a young woman.\u201cHou Xiaomei!\u201d he thought, blinking. He suddenly realized that he had struck it very lucky, as if he\u2019d shoved a random stick into the ground only to have it grow into a lovely shady tree.After a moment, he took a deep breath and then looked over at his courtyard residence. His eyes gleamed, and he stood tall and straight beneath the moonlight.\u201cWell, I guess becoming an Outer Sect disciple isn\u2019t that bad after all!\u201d Flicking his sleeve, he walked into the courtyard.1. Zhang Dahai\u2019s name in Chinese is \u5f20\u5927\u6d77 zh\u0101ng d\u00e0 h\u01cei \u2013 Zhang is a common surname. Dahai means ocean or literally \u201cbig sea\u201d2. Chen Qingrou\u2019s name in Chinese is \u9648\u8f7b\u67d4 ch\u00e9n q\u012bng r\u00f3u. Chen is a common surname. Qingrou means 'soft\u201d or \u201cgentle.\u201d This sounds like a very feminine namePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 15: Undying Live Forever Technique!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15: Undying Live Forever Technique!Moonlight flooded down onto Fragrant Cloud Peak of the Spirit Stream Sect, dispersing some of the mists that covered it, and causing the entire scene to be spectacularly beautiful.About halfway down the east face of the mountain, at the end of a side path, was a courtyard residence. The courtyard itself was as large as a field, and was filled with the delicate fragrance of flowers and plants. The residence itself was a log cabin, complete with a desk and a bed inside, all of which were made from some sort of magenta-colored wood that let off a lovely, fragrant aroma. This place was far superior to anything in the servants\u2019 district.The field in the courtyard had been cleared, and was ready for planting. There was even a well in one corner. Bai Xiaochun looked around at the moonlit scene, and his eyes sparkled with satisfaction.\u201cOuter Sect disciples are official disciples of the Spirit Stream Sect, so naturally they get much better compensation than the servants. This residence really isn\u2019t bad at all. Although, I remember Eldest Brother saying that Inner Sect disciples get to live in Immortal\u2019s caves\u2026 I wonder what those are like.\u201d Bai Xiaochun looked up toward the top of Fragrant Cloud Peak.Only Inner Sect disciples qualified to live on the top half of the mountain.After a while, he went back into the log cabin, where he stretched lazily and then took out his bag of holding. After patting it carefully, a bottle of medicinal pills appeared in front of him, as well as a green stick of incense.\u201cWow, this thing is awesome,\u201d he thought, rubbing the bag of holding fondly. After a moment, his eyes came to rest on the medicinal pill bottle and the green incense. The pill bottle had a label on it, upon which were written the words \u2018Spirit Condensation.\u2019 As for the incense, the words \u2018Green Rising\u2019 were carved on the side. He had received similar things when he had become a servant. Consuming such pills would increase his cultivation base, and inhaling the smoke from the burning incense stick would have a similar effect.\u201cUsing them as-is would be a big waste. It would be much better to use spirit enhancement on them first. Maybe I could even use them to break through a bottleneck in my cultivation base.\u201d After pondering the matter for a bit, he made his decision. However, he only had one-colored firewood on hand, so he decided to go down the mountain the following morning to get something better.Having made his decision, he sat down cross-legged and began to meditate. When it came to his cultivation, he had never given up. Although his progress had slowed recently, he still spent time every day on it.The whole purpose to practicing cultivation was to live forever, so of course he would stick to it.The night passed uneventfully, and soon it was dawn. Sunlight poked through the mist, making it seem as if valuable treasures were descending. Bai Xiaochun had been cultivating all night. He opened his eyes, donned his Outer Sect disciple clothing, and then hurried out of his log cabin to find the Scripture Pavilion that Elder Brother Hou had mentioned the day before.The Scripture Pavilion was some distance away from his own residence, on another side of the mountain. It took about an hour of walking before he saw a cluster of towering pagodas off in the distance. They radiated shimmering light, and sent pulsing pressure out in all directions.He encountered quite a few other Outer Sect disciples, all of whom were hustling about busily. When they sensed that Bai Xiaochun was only at the third level of Qi Condensation, they completely ignored him.Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t care, but considering that most of the disciples he encountered had cultivation bases far higher than his own, he proceeded cautiously. There were even a few he encountered whose cultivation bases were so high that they were unreadable. Those ones always had crowds of other disciples clustered around them, laughing and chatting with them as they walked along.The closer he got to the Scripture Pavilion, the more disciples he saw. Just as he was about to enter the area of the building itself, a beam of light flew down toward the area from one of the distant mountain peaks. Within that beam of light, it was possible to see a young man standing on a flying disk, who circled around Fragrant Cloud Peak before flying back off into the distance.\u201cThat\u2019s Qian Dajin from the Court Hall! Elder Brother Qian!\u201d\u201cElder Brother Qian is an Inner Sect disciple, and also a member of the Court Hall. He\u2019s famous! I heard that he\u2019s in the great circle of the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and has access to temporary flight items. I\u2019m so jealous!\u201dBai Xiaochun also looked over jealously. After Qian Dajin disappeared, he sighed inwardly.\u201cOne of these days, when I can fly, I\u2019m going take time every day to fly in circles around Fragrant Cloud Peak!\u201d Muttering to himself in anticipation, he began to push his way through the crowd toward the Scripture Pavilion.The building was huge. The first floor was completely empty except for a long table. Behind the table, an old man sat there with his eyes closed in meditation. All the disciples who wanted to go past him would put their identity medallion onto the table. After it shone with glittering light, they would pass by respectfully.Copying everyone else, Bai Xiaochun placed his identity medallion onto the table. It only took a moment for it to glitter, after which he picked it back up and followed the other disciples up the stairs to the second floor.This floor was filled with numerous shelves, which were packed with jade slips or the occasional bamboo scroll. All of them shimmered with bright light, making the second floor of the Scripture Pavilion an extraordinary place.Seeing another staircase further off, Bai Xiaochun looked around and then walked over. However, when he tried to step onto it, his foot bounced back.A young man was sitting off to the side, with straight eyebrows and a bamboo scroll in his hand. When he sensed what was happening, he looked up at Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun put on his most charming expression and then curiously asked the young man, \u201cElder Brother, what qualifications do you need to go up there?\u201d\u201cWhat, are you new here?\u201d the young man replied slowly. \u201cYou have to be at the fifth level of Qi Condensation to go up there.\u201d With that, he continued to read the bamboo scroll.Bai Xiaochun could tell the young man didn\u2019t want to be disturbed. Forgetting about the third floor, he began to stroll around the second floor. Occasionally he would pick up a jade slip to examine, or look through some bamboo scrolls. He saw all sorts of different magical techniques, all of which seemed very exciting.That was especially true of something called the Flame Dao magical technique, which seemed especially exceptional.After a while, he found a jade slip for the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art. It had descriptions and pictures for the fourth to eighth levels. He quickly grabbed it and then continued to stroll about.Time passed, and soon evening was approaching. Bai Xiaochun had browsed about seventy percent of the second floor, and by now, the crowds were thinning.\u201cThese eight seem really incredible\u2026.\u201d he thought, looking over his selections. One was a bamboo scroll, somewhat dilapidated, but something that had caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes to widen with excitement the moment he saw it.\u201cUndying Live Forever Technique!!\u201dHe took a deep breath as he examined the introduction to the technique. Apparently, cultivating this technique to the ultimate degree would make a person undying and also be able to live forever.Panting, he once again examined the name of the technique, and then decided that this was his decision!He had begun practicing cultivation for the purpose of living forever, so finding a technique like this one almost made it seem like they were mysteriously connected by destiny. Laughing heartily, he held the bamboo scroll in his hand as he climbed down the stairs.Back in the main hall of the first floor, the old man was still sitting behind the table with his eyes closed, looking exactly like he had before. However, as soon as Bai Xiaochun put the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art jade slip and the Undying Live Forever Technique bamboo scroll onto the table, the man\u2019s eyes slowly opened.He looked Bai Xiaochun up and down, which left Bai Xiaochun trembling. The man\u2019s gaze felt like lightning. Shivering, Bai Xiaochun immediately put on his most respectful expression.Thankfully, the old man quickly looked down at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s identity medallion.\u201cNewly promoted disciples can take a copy of the first eight levels of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art,\u201d the old man said slowly, his voice hoarse. \u201cThey may also select a technique of their choosing.\u201d Then his eyes fell upon the Undying Live Forever Technique bamboo scroll, and he frowned slightly.\u201cAlthough the name of this technique sounds astonishing, it\u2019s incomplete. Furthermore, the more you cultivate it, the more difficult it becomes. The pain is so excruciating that ordinary people can\u2019t endure it. Even most Inner Sect disciples can\u2019t cultivate it successfully. The majority give up. It\u2019s been here in the Scripture Pavilion for quite some time. Are you sure you want this particular magic?\u201d The old man looked at Bai Xiaochun.After hearing the old man\u2019s words, Bai Xiaochun got the feeling that this technique had been waiting here for years just for him. Then he thought again about the words \u2018undying\u2019 and \u2018live forever\u2019, and his blood felt like it was boiling. He immediately responded, \u201cSenior, I definitely want it, very much!\u201dThe old man said nothing further to dissuade him. He waved his right hand, sending two blank jade slips flying out. After the copies were made, he handed them to Bai Xiaochun, then paid him no more heed and went back to meditating.Bai Xiaochun put the jade slips away. Eyes gleaming with anticipation, he left the Scripture Pavilion and headed back to his courtyard residence.By the time he got back, it was already nighttime. Once again inside his log cabin, he sat down cross-legged, took a deep breath, and pulled out the jade slip for the Undying Live Forever Technique. Then he circulated his spiritual energy and sent it into the jade slip. After closing his eyes, the technique\u2019s magical incantation appeared in his mind.An hour later, he opened his eyes again, and a thoughtful expression could be seen.Just as the old man had said, the Undying Live Forever Technique was incomplete. According to the description, the technique was cultivated in two ways, internally and externally. It was further broken down into the external aspects of skin, muscle, and tendon.The internal aspects were bones and blood.As for this incomplete version, it only contained the technique for cultivating skin. Also, the cultivation method truly did seem to be a torment. Furthermore, to cultivate it required a huge expenditure of resources. However, there were several secret magics listed inside that seemed almost beyond belief. For example, there was one called the Throat Crushing Grasp that was supposedly unbeatable.Bai Xiaochun hesitated for a moment, then looked once more at the words \u2018undying\u2019 and \u2018live forever\u2019. Finally, his eyes filled with determination, and he followed the description in the information, using both of his hands to strike various positions on his body.Bai Xiaochun was focused on not dying and living forever in a way that vastly outmatched other people. Therefore, he did exactly as the technique required, and beat himself the entire night.The following day, his whole body hurt. It didn\u2019t matter whether he stood up or sat down. Even lifting his arm hurt. And yet, he gritted his teeth and continued to do as the technique manual instructed, and forced himself to move.\u201cOwwwwwww\u2026. Relax then flex\u2026. aaaaoooowwwww\u2026. flex then relax!\u201d he said, repeating one of the lines from the technique as he hopped and skipped around the courtyard. He let out one miserable shriek after another, and tears were streaming down his face. Finally, he gritted his teeth, grabbed some spirit stones, and headed down the mountain.He figured that if he had to move around, he might as well just go out and buy the medicinal plants he needed to get the Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill. That would be a lot better than doing nothing more than exercising in his courtyard.Soon, numerous Outer Sect disciples on Fragrant Cloud Peak saw a very strange sight. There was a fair-faced young man hopping and skipping about in a very strange fashion. He was also crying out at the top of his lungs in a fashion which almost sounded euphoric.\u201cAh ah, oh oh! Ah ah, oh oh! Ah\u2026 ah\u2026 ah\u2026 ah\u2026\u201dBai Xiaochun didn\u2019t want to cry out, but the pain was just too much. In fact, it hurt so much that he was pretty sure that even not moving would also hurt. However, all he had to do was think about the words \u2018undying\u2019 and \u2018live forever\u2019, and he continued with vicious determination. And thus he continued all the way down to the market outside of the sect.Trembling, he bought all of the medicinal plants he needed, as well as some one-colored firewood. The two-colored firewood was much more expensive, so he only bought one piece. After that, he ran out of spirit stones.Gritting his teeth, he went back to the Missions Office and handed in the mission he had taken when he was still a servant. In return, he got the Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill.The pill was yellow, about as big as his thumbnail, and emanated a strange medicinal aroma. He looked at the pill, his body still burning with so much pain that he could barely talk. Sweat poured down him, soaking him completely.Clenching his teeth, he climbed back up the steps of Fragrant Cloud Peak, leaving a trail of sweat behind him as he went. He got quite a few surprised and even cynical glances from other Outer Sect disciples. After all, he was really sweating far beyond what was normal.He really wasn\u2019t sure what was going on. By the time he got back to his courtyard residence, it was the middle of the night. As soon as he walked inside, he collapsed onto the ground, unconscious.Despite having passed out, the pain woke him up several times through the night. By the time the light of dawn spread out across the sky, though, he woke up and realized that the pain was gone.\u201cAn incomplete minor cycle\u2026.\u201d he thought, recalling the technique\u2019s introduction. If he could go for a full day and night without passing out, that would be a complete minor cycle. If he could complete eighty-one minor cycles, that would count as a minor circulation. After that, his skin would be changed, and would reach a point that the process wouldn\u2019t be so painful.\u201cIf the technique were simple, everyone would do it, and then everyone would be able to live forever. The harder it is, the more I\u2019m going to cultivate it! Then I\u2019ll really be undying and able to live forever!\u201d His eyes filled with determination; his obsession with living forever was strong, and had reached a truly astonishing level.Now that his body didn\u2019t hurt any more, he pulled out the Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill and studied it. He was just about to eat it when all of a sudden he seemed to recall something. Looking around to make sure no one was watching, he hurried into his log cabin and performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, causing the turtle-wok to appear.\u201cTo consume it the way it is would be a big loss. The best thing to do is eat it after doing a spirit enhancement.\u201d Licking his lips, he produced the two-colored flame firewood and kindled it beneath the turtle-wok. Immediately, the log burst into flames, and moments later, became ash. At the same time, two glowing designs appeared on the turtle-wok.After a moment of hesitation, he placed the Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill inside. Almost as soon as the spirit medicine entered the wok, silver light flashed. Having experienced this before, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change in the least, and he continued to stare at the wok.After a moment, the silver light faded away and, shockingly, two silver designs could be seen on the Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill. The medicinal aroma which floated off of it was now much stronger than it had been before, so strong that a mere sniff would enliven the spirits.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad I don\u2019t have anything to make a three-colored flame.\u201d He picked up the spirit medicine and put it into his mouth. The instant it melted, it transformed into a scalding current that swept through his body.Bai Xiaochun felt his mind rumbling, and his body felt like a furnace. However, even as he was consumed by heat, the white hair on his head turned black again. A powerful surge of life force replenished him, and after a moment, he could tell that it was even stronger than before. A bit of blood oozed out of his nose.\u201cMajor success!\u201d he thought, his eyes widening. He immediately began to cultivate the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art, but found that there was little difference. After all, this spirit medicine replenished vital energy, not spiritual energy. More blood flowed out of his nose, and the scalding current inside of him expanded. He felt like he was an inflatable ball that was on the verge of popping. Astonishment filled him.Actually, the result of performing a twofold enhancement on the spirit medicine ensured that the result vastly exceeded anything from before, and was far more valuable. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation base, which was at the third level of Qi Condensation, simply couldn\u2019t take it.At this critical juncture, he suddenly thought of the Undying Live Forever Technique. He immediately leapt up and began hitting himself as hard as possible.Popping sounds rang out, and the scalding current began to clear up. Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t dare to stop. It wasn\u2019t until an hour later that the current faded away completely. He was in so much pain that he fell down onto the ground, panting for air. However, he looked more excited than ever, and his eyes shone with an intense gleam.\u201cIt has something to do with the spirit enhancement, but the main thing was that spirit medicine. Spirit medicine\u2026 is remarkable\u2026. It can increase spiritual energy and can increase longevity\u2026. Well, I wonder if there\u2019s a type of medicine that can make people live forever!\u201d The more he thought about it, the more excited he got, and the brighter his eyes shone.\u201cFragrant Cloud Peak trains apothecaries\u2026.\u201cWell then, I\u2019m going to become an apothecary. I\u2019m going to make\u2026. a Live-Forever Never-Die Pill!\u201d Bai Xiaochun began to pant, and his intrigue for spirit medicine reached an unheard-of level.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His body ached, and yet somehow he could tell that his skin was tougher than before. That made him look forward more than ever to becoming an apothecary.After laying there in the courtyard for more than an hour, the shaky, painful feeling eventually faded away. Bai Xiaochun crawled into a cross-legged position, eyes flickering as he patted his bag of holding to produce the medicinal pills and medicinal incense.After closer inspection, he took a deep breath, looked around furtively, then headed back into the log cabin, where he once again took out the turtle-wok.\u201cI could consume this medicinal pill as is. But after I do a spirit enhancement, it should be able to break my cultivation base through from the third level of Qi Condensation to the fourth. It\u2019s too bad that two-colored firewood is so expensive. The Ovens has some, but I\u2019m not longer a servant there anymore, which makes things complicated.\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s excitement regarding the medicinal pill continued to grow. After a bit of thought, he ceased any hesitation and produced a piece of one-colored firewood.\u201cI\u2019ll just do a basic enhancement! That\u2019ll be good enough!\u201d He quickly lit the firewood, and the resulting one-colored flame caused the first turtle-wok design to light up. He opened the medicinal pill bottle and poured out the three medicinal pills it contained, all of which were as large as longan fruits.After performing three spirit enhancements, flickering silver designs could be seen on the surface of the medicinal pills. He also enhanced the green incense. In the end, he sat there looking at the four different spirit medicines upon which he had performed a basic enhancement. Finally, he placed the incense stick in front of him and then popped the three medicinal pills into his mouth.Then he examined the pictures in the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art manual, and followed the mnemonics as he began to practice cultivation. Soon, the spiritual energy in his body was seething. He could now maintain the posture for much longer than before, and he could feel his cultivation base rising rapidly.After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, the little river of spiritual energy inside of him was flowing through his body, and he could sense that he was nearing a breakthrough to the fourth level of Qi Condensation.\u201cI just need to hold on for one hundred breaths of time, and I can break through!\u201d He gritted his teeth as he continued to maintain the posture in the fourth picture. His body was swelling up so much that he felt like a ball, and cracking sounds could be heard inside of him. Great beads of sweat were rolling off of him.It was at this point that the spiritual energy began to wane. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes narrowed in concentration, and he blew a mouthful of spiritual energy onto the green incense stick in front of him.As soon as the spiritual energy touched the green incense, it lit up, causing tendrils of green smoke to swirl about like green snakes. They flew through the air, entering into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, and then turning into strong spiritual energy. Within moments, the river of spiritual energy inside of him had doubled in size.Rumbling could be heard as a wind-like shockwave rolled out from Bai Xiaochun, spreading out through the cabin and then into the courtyard. His eyes opened, and they shone with pleasure.\u201cThe fourth level of Qi Condensation!\u201d he exclaimed, laughing.He could immediately sense the spiritual energy surging through him, carrying with it a strong life force. He felt more agile, and when he looked down, he saw black filth caked all over his body. That would be the impurities within his body that had just been forced out.His body flickered as he floated out of the log cabin. After tidying up the courtyard a bit, he stood there feeling very energized. He quickly performed an incantation gesture and waved his finger, causing his wooden sword to fly out of his bag of holding in a streak of light.He sent it flying back and forth, eyes gleaming with satisfaction. The wooden sword was already extraordinary, but now that it was combined with the cultivation base of the fourth level of Qi Condensation, it possessed an even more striking air.\u201cSpirit enhancement is pretty awesome. It would be great if I could use a three-colored flame, though. A medicinal pill like that would be incredible!\u201d The more he thought about it, the more miraculous spirit medicine seemed to be. Regardless of whether it was in pill form or incense form, it was definitely an absolute necessity for practicing cultivation.\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to become an amazing apothecary! I\u2019ll concoct a Live-Forever Never-Die Pill! Then I\u2019ll enhance it tenfold\u2013no, wait, I\u2019ll enhance it a hundredfold!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s desire to become an apothecary was growing stronger. Suddenly, he slapped his bag of holding to produce a jade slip.It was none other than the jade slip given him by Hou Yunfei when they had gone to the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion together. Inside were images of 10,000 types of plants and vegetation. Only Fragrant Cloud Peak had ancient records of this type, and they were something that all apprentice apothecaries had to master.Of course, a mere 10,000 types of plants and vegetation was only the beginning. According to Hou Yunfei, after memorizing those, you could acquire another volume.With a look of resolve, he circulated his spiritual energy, and images of various types of plants and vegetation rose up in his mind. He was filled with a strange feeling, as if a whole new page of life had opened up in front of him. There were even descriptions of the medicinal plants needed to trade for an Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill.After examining the contents of the jade slip, he realized that memorizing each of the 10,000 items wouldn\u2019t really be that difficult. However, he wasn\u2019t just any old person. His goal was to become a great apothecary who could concoct a Live-Forever Never-Die Pill.The vicious determination concealed in his personality once again exploded out. This was not just memorizing a simple list; he had to carefully observe all of the details of each type of medicinal plant. Only after understanding a plant fully could he move on to the next one.Back when he had been under such pressure because of Xu Baocai, he had practiced cultivation like mad for the better part of half a year. Now, with even grander aspirations, a similar thing was occurring.He studied the medicinal plants down to the tiniest detail, until he could close his eyes and recall an image of each and every one.However, he still felt as if that wasn\u2019t enough, and wished he could study the actual items to make his research complete. Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do about that. All he could do was carefully research what he had at his disposal, which included the shapes of the leaves and the patterns of the veins.Even that wasn\u2019t enough for Bai Xiaochun though. He also studied the roots and the fruits. It was almost as if the plants themselves were right in front of him, several times their normal size and dug up out of the ground for him to study.After that, he still didn\u2019t feel confident enough. Next, he studied the tiny hairs growing on the plants, and even the tiny pore-like openings beneath them.Time passed. Soon, a month had gone by. During that time, he spent time every day practicing the fourth level of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art, and was getting much more comfortable with his cultivation base. At the same time, he hadn\u2019t forgotten about the Undying Live Forever Technique. Every day, he endured the pain as he ran around his courtyard practicing it, simultaneously memorizing the plants and vegetation from the jade slip. Unfortunately, the jade slip had no table of contents, so he wasn\u2019t sure exactly how many he had memorized so far.In addition to exercising in his courtyard, he would often stop by the spirit field in the corner, where he was growing ten medicinal plants.These ten plants were Spiritwinter Bamboo. He had gone to Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s Outer Sect disciple Mission Stele half a month before and selected a simple, non-dangerous mission to get them.Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t dare to forget what Li Qinghou had told him. Sect disciples needed to complete at least one mission every half year; it was a sect rule that Bai Xiaochun had kept firmly planted in mind.The merit point reward for this mission was significant, and could actually be even higher depending on how many goods were turned in at the end. It was a simple mission, but required quite a bit of time wastage; he had to care for the plants for three months before he could hand the mission in.Of course, the Spiritwinter Bamboo could be catalyzed by a cultivator\u2019s spiritual energy, which would make it grow faster. Unfortunately, Bai Xiaochun had no time to test that method, and had simply planted the seeds in his spirit field as soon as he had gotten back.\u201cYou grow so slowly,\u201d he said, looking down at the spirit field. From the description in the jade slip, he knew that Spiritwinter Bamboo required a lot of spiritual energy to grow properly. If the soil it was growing in didn\u2019t have strong spiritual energy, then the cultivator would need to add spiritual energy personally.He squatted down and picked up a handful of soil from the spirit field. After a moment, he muttered, \u201cI bet this spirit field doesn\u2019t have enough spiritual energy, and that\u2019s why the Spiritwinter Bamboo is growing so slowly.\u201cWhat can I do to get the spirit field\u2019s spiritual energy to be a bit stronger\u2026?\u201d After a moment of thought, his expression lit up, and he extended his right hand, within which materialized the turtle-wok.He looked at the wok, and then back at the spirit field, and his eyes began to shine.\u201cIf this wok can enhance anything, then\u2026 I should be able to perform a spirit enhancement on the spirit soil, right?\u201d Feeling very curious all of a sudden, he quickly dug up the Spiritwinter Bamboo seeds, then filled the turtle-wok with spirit soil and produced a piece of one-colored firewood to perform a test.Soon, silver light flashed, and the spirit soil in the turtle-wok glowed with the design of a basic spirit enhancement. The light quickly faded, but the spirit soil clearly emanated a much stronger spiritual energy than before.Bai Xiaochun was delighted. Not feeling the slightest bit inconvenienced whatsoever, he quickly began to enhance one wokful of spirit soil after another. After more than an hour had passed, when he was just about out of one-colored firewood, the entire spirit field had benefited from a basic spirit enhancement.Of course, that was only the top level of soil. He didn\u2019t have enough firewood to go any lower. Therefore, because there was no foundation for the spirit soil, after enough time passed, it would gradually return to normal.Even so, the current spiritual energy in the spirit field had undergone a Heaven-shaking, Earth-toppling transformation, and was so strong that it caused a fragrant aroma to swirl about.Bai Xiaochun immediately planted the Spiritwinter Bamboo seeds again, then stood off to the side watching. It didn\u2019t take long before some tiny buds popped up and began to grow rapidly.In the blink of an eye, they were almost a meter tall. In fact, if disciples in the sect who were adept at growing medicinal plants saw what was happening, they would certainly gasp. Even if a cultivator skillfully nourished the plants with spiritual energy, they wouldn\u2019t grow so fast.After all\u2026 no one in the cultivation world had ever been so extravagant as to perform spirit enhancement on soil, all for the purpose of growing ten stalks of Spiritwinter Bamboo\u2026.Not even the famous grandmasters of spirit enhancement would ever think to do such a thing; it was simply far too much of a waste.Seeing that the Spiritwinter Bamboo was now growing well, Bai Xiaochun felt very pleased. He turned back and continued to jog around the courtyard, simultaneously studying the plants and vegetation in the jade slip.The sun was setting, and the sky grew dark. Considering that the stalks of Spiritwinter Bamboo had already grown higher than a meter, and had apparently still not reached its full height, it was hard to say\u2026 exactly how tall they would be in three months\u2026.That night, Bai Xiaochun finally put the jade slip down. After vicious hard work, he had finally thoroughly memorized all 10,000 types of plants and vegetation. He had even found some areas in the descriptions of the medicinal plants that revealed how they conflicted with other medicinal plants.\u201cTomorrow morning, I\u2019m going to go get the second volume about plants and vegetation. I wonder what the test at the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion will be like. Can I really pass it?\u201dBai Xiaochun set his chin and flicked his sleeve. He had just been planning on uttering some bold and audacious words, but then, just couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit anxious. Clearing his throat, he picked up the jade slip again and began to study some more. He just couldn\u2019t shake the fear that some problem would come up in the test.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as he walked out of his log cabin, he looked over at the Spiritwinter Bamboo and saw that it was already taller than half the height of an average person. He nodded his head in satisfaction, then left the courtyard and headed in the direction of the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion.The sun rose up over the horizon, sending scintillating beams of light out in all directions. The multi-colored sunlight dancing among the mists like golden carps was a truly spectacular sight. Bai Xiaochun was currently hurrying along a path along with numerous other Outer Sect disciples. He didn\u2019t recognize any of them, which caused him to suddenly miss his Elder Brothers from the Ovens.\u201cI wonder how Eldest Brother is doing, and Third Fatty Hei\u2026.\u201d Sighing inwardly, he walked along for about an hour, until the sun was high in the sky. Finally, he saw the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion off in the distance, and the ten shocking stone steles set up outside of it.Those stone steles were the identifying feature of the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion. Green light emanated off of them, rising a hundred or more meters up into the air. It was an amazing sight, like ten giants standing there, completely intimidating.Visible on the surface of the stones steles were lines of text, a ranking system that went from one to a hundred.Toward the top, there were no names, only various images, which were in fact the insignias of various Outer Sect Chosen who had become famous apothecaries in the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion.Every apothecary had a unique insignia which they would use to mark the satisfactory spirit medicines they had concocted. It was a tradition that went back throughout the ages, and therefore, it was an important honor to all apothecaries.The last time he had come here, Hou Yunfei had explained all of these things briefly. But now that Bai Xiaochun was coming here alone, he couldn\u2019t help but stare at the ten stone steles.The first thing that caught his attention was the eye-catching insignia on the first place position of the foremost stone stele.It was a magic bottle! 1According to Hou Yunfei, that magic bottle was the insignia of\u2026 Zhou Xinqi!The name was not unfamiliar to Bai Xiaochun. Back when he was a servant, he remembered sitting under the moonlight as Big Fatty Zhang munched on a ginseng rootlet and sighed about Zhou Xinqi.She came from a clan of mortals, and several years ago had been discovered by one of the Senior members of the sect, who sensed that she had unusual latent talent. When she arrived in the sect and was formally tested, her latent talent caused a huge commotion in the Spirit Stream Sect.She had a rare plant and vegetations spirit meridian, which not only made her speed of cultivation many times greater than the average person, but also gave her astonishing potential when it came to synthesizing medicine. After joining Fragrant Cloud Peak, she became Li Qinghou\u2019s only apprentice, and was actually viewed as the most important apothecary in the sect next to Li Qinghou, and a future pillar!According to the rules of the Spirit Stream Sect, it didn\u2019t matter how high a person\u2019s latent talent was, they couldn\u2019t automatically become an Inner Sect disciple. Therefore, Zhou Xingqi was just like all the other Chosen from the other mountain peaks on the south bank. They all started out as disciples in the Outer Sect, where they trained hard to improve. However, the cultivation resources they had access to were actually provided by the Inner Sect.Everyone knew that it wouldn\u2019t be long before Zhou Xinqi would prove herself and become an Inner Sect disciple.On top of all that, she was astonishingly beautiful, which earned her the wide admiration of countless male disciples.Because of all of these reasons, she was very famous on Fragrant Cloud Peak. In fact, the Inner Sect disciples didn\u2019t view her as belonging to the Outer Sect. Even the conservative Inner Sect as a whole feared her.As Bai Xiaochun considered all these matters, he suddenly felt very curious about Zhou Xinqi. Then he made his way from one stone stele to the next, closely looking at all ten. Soon, he was virtually struck speechless.\u201cZhou Xinqi is amazing. Of these ten stone steles, her name is in first place on eight! I don\u2019t see her name at all on the other two; presumably she hasn\u2019t competed for those yet!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were as wide as saucers as he looked at all the stone steles.By now, the crowd of disciples that had gathered around the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion had swelled to quite a number. Bai Xiaochun looked away from the stone steles and found the location where he could exchange his jade slip for the second volume of plants and vegetation. As he looked around, he realized that there really were a lot of people present, almost as if they were gathering in advance for some reason. Suddenly, he heard people talking excitedly.\u201cElder Sister Zhou is coming!\u201d\u201cHahaha! So the rumors were true! Elder Sister Zhou is coming today. We didn\u2019t come in vain!\u201d\u201cElder Sister Zhou has already taken first place in the five volumes of plants and vegetation and three volumes of spirit creatures. This time she\u2019ll definitely challenge the fourth volume of spirit creatures!\u201dThe buzz of conversation rose and fell, and the crowd grew more packed. Bai Xiaochun was stuck in the very middle, but thankfully he wasn\u2019t as fat as he had been before. After jostling around a bit, he managed to get out in front. Just as he did, he looked up and saw a bright beam of light flying through the air.It was blue flying silk, standing atop which was a young woman wearing the clothing of the Outer Sect. Long black hair flew behind her in the wind; she had narrow, phoenix-like eyebrows and eyes that shone as cold as the moon. Her complexion was lovely, her frame thin and lithe.As she flew toward one of the ten stone steles, a cheer rose up from the surrounding Outer Sect disciples. She landed and, without even glancing around, headed directly toward one of the log cabins erected beneath the stone steles.It was only at this point that Bai Xiaochun noticed that all ten of the stone steles had log cabins beneath them. In fact, there were currently people going in and out of all of them, and that included the one the young woman had just entered.The surrounding disciples were very excited. Bai Xiaochun looked around and found one particular disciple who looked skinnier and weaker than the others, and sidled up to him.Then, he cried out loudly, \u201cAt long last, I can lay eyes on Elder Sister Zhou again. This time she\u2019s definitely going to take first place on the ninth stone stele!\u201dAfter that, he turned and asked the skinny guy for more details about what was going on. Considering the young man was in such a good mood, he quickly gave a detailed explanation.\u201cElder Sister Zhou wants to be the first person from ancient times to now to have first place in all ten stone steles. And she\u2019s the only person who could possibly do it. All she has to do is take the test for the fourth and fifth volumes of spirit creatures, and she\u2019ll definitely take first place in both!\u201dBai Xiaochun decided that the most important thing was to get the second volume of plants and vegetation, which meant that he had to go take the test in the appropriate log cabin. If he succeeded, the volume would be his. Therefore, he began to push his way through the crowd to the first stone stele. It wasn\u2019t easy, and after he got there, he found that all the cabins were already occupied. After waiting a bit, he saw a crestfallen disciple moping out from one of them, but that didn\u2019t discourage him at all. He immediately entered the log cabin.Once inside, it was as if he was completely separated from the cacophony of sound on the outside; everything here was peaceful and quiet. The log cabin wasn\u2019t very large, and in the middle, a prayer mat was laid out in front of a small stone stele.Bai Xiaochun sat down cross-legged in the prescribed fashion, then pulled out the jade slip that contained the first volume of plants and vegetation. He placed it up against the stone stele, and it sank down inside. The stone stele shuddered, and began to shine brightly.\u201cAccording to what the Elder Brother outside said, now is when I\u2019m supposed to decide what insignia will identify me as an apothecary.\u201d After thinking for a moment, he chuckled and drew the image of a turtle. He loved turtles, and although his drawing was a bit misshapen and ugly, in his eyes it was pretty good.The turtle insignia flickered a few times, and Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath. He settled his qi and cleared his mind, and his eyes began to shine brightly. Finally, he slowly reached out and put his hand onto the stone stele. In the moment that he touched it, rumbling sounds filled his mind, and his vision swam. When it became clear again, he was no longer in the log cabin, but in an illusory world.Before he could size up his surroundings, light flashed in front of him, and countless medicinal plants appeared, filling his field of view.None of the medicinal plants were intact. Instead, they were broken up into pieces of ten or more, all of which were scattered about.Just by looking around, it was impossible to tell how many plants there were in total.This testing method of the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion was what countless Outer Sect disciples of the Fragrant Cloud Peak dreaded. Throughout the years, numerous disciples had taken the test, only to feel completely useless at the end. Because of that, if your name made it into the top 100 on the stone stele, you would be the object of mass envy and approval.That was especially true of the first place spot, which led to total fame.A cold, emotionless voice suddenly rang out: \u201cIn the time it takes an incense stick to burn, re-assemble the spirit plants. Your test results will be based on the total number you put together. You may begin now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought. He almost couldn\u2019t believe it. He had immersed himself in studying the medicinal plants in the jade slip to the point where even now, he could already spot hundreds of medicinal plant parts that he could piece together.He had been really worried about this test, but now that he saw what it was like, he heaved a sigh of relief. However, he still wasn\u2019t completely at ease.\u201cIt can\u2019t be this easy. Considering the test is so simple, the final target to pass must be incredibly high.\u201d Once again feeling nervous, he quickly waved his finger through the air, pointing at a dozen or so medicinal plant fragments. Immediately, those fragments pieced themselves together, forming two medicinal plants.Next he waved both hands in the air, not even pausing as he sent countless plant fragments flying around and forming together. One medicinal plant after another was formed, until soon he had 100 medicinal plants.He looked up in thought for a moment, and his spirits lifted. Tuning everything else out, he focused completely on the medicinal plant fragments, his hands flying about rapidly. Then, he suddenly thought about how terrible it would be to fail the test, and went all out with even more vicious determination. His eyes were completely bloodshot, and his hands moved even faster.100 plants. 200 plants. 300 plants. 500 plants\u2026. 1,000 plants!Sweat poured down his face, white steam rose from the top of his head, and his hands flew. He looked around, instantly identifying more medicinal plant parts that could be pieced together. Back when he had been memorizing the medicinal plants in the jade slip, he had been so devoted to the process that he had reached the point where he wished he could grind the plants into powder to study them further.However, that wasn\u2019t possible, so he could only study them in minute detail until he felt that he understood them completely.If any of the disciples on the outside could see what was happening, they would gasp in disbelief. To them, this test was so terrifying it made the hair on their necks stand up straight. None of them could possibly imagine how thoroughly Bai Xiaochun had researched the medicinal plants in the jade slip.Time passed. 2,000 plants. 3,000 plants\u2026.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were completely bloodshot as he forced his hands to follow his train of thought. He even relied on the power of the fourth level of Qi Condensation, fearful that he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up.Despite how fast he was going, he wasn\u2019t sure if he would be able to pass, so all he could do was grit his teeth and keep going.4,000 plants. 5,000 plants. 6,000 plants. 7,000 plants\u2026.He wasn\u2019t sure how much time had passed, and there were still some plant fragments left. Suddenly, light began to shine everywhere, and his vision swam. The log cabin came back into view again, and the jade slip appeared on the surface of the stone stele. It was the same slip he had put in before, which contained the first volume of plants and vegetation.\u201cI missed a few, but only a few\u2026.\u201d he thought apprehensively. After picking up the jade slip, he walked out of the log cabin, feeling completely crestfallen. It was at this point that he heard the cheering on the outside.He looked up in the direction of the log cabin Zhou Xinqi had entered. As she walked out, her name suddenly appeared in first place.1. If you look up this word for \u201cmagic bottle\u201d in the C>E dictionaries, it is often defined as Aquarius (the western constellation). While the term has come to be an accepted translation for Acquarius, the original meaning of the word, especially as it pertains to xianxia, is a type of bottle used in Buddhist ritualsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Elder Sister Zhou did it! Didn\u2019t I say she would get another unprecedented first place spot!?\u201d\u201cShe definitely deserves to have that plants and vegetation spirit meridian. Her options for the future are endless!\u201d\u201cElder Sister Zhou, we\u2019ll be waiting for you to set another record. When you get first place in all ten, the Great Spirit Stream Bell will toll to notify the whole sect!\u201d All of the surrounding Outer Sect disciples were cheering. Although there were a few disgruntled faces to be seen, and a few sharply spoken words, they were drowned out by the overwhelming applause. Zhou Xinqi\u2019s position among the disciples here was like the sun within the sky. In fact, she was well regarded by virtually everyone on Fragrant Cloud Peak.Although she was normally quite cold, the applause of the surrounding disciples couldn\u2019t help but make her feel a bit pleased with herself, and she smiled slightly. That smile caused the cheering to grow even louder.Bai Xiaochun stood there in the crowd, feeling quite envious of her. Muttering to himself, he looked back at the first stone stele and suddenly, his eyes went wide. Then he looked back down at the jade slip with the first volume of plants and vegetation, and after closer scrutiny, he realized that in addition to the original 10,000 types of plants and vegetation, another 10,000 had been added. His heart suddenly swelled with joy.He then turned his head to look at the first stone stele, and saw that right above the magic bottle insignia was the image of a turtle. Suddenly, he felt wonderful.He had originally planned to leave immediately. But now, filled with excitement, he waited to hear the audience begin to applaud his accomplishment. However, it quickly became apparent that everyone was only paying attention to Zhou Xinqi, and hadn\u2019t even noticed what had just occurred. In fact, even Zhou Xinqi was preparing to depart.Bai Xiaochun immediately started getting nervous. Blinking, he suddenly called out in his most astonished voice: \u201cLook! Elder Sister Zhou isn\u2019t in first place on the first stone stele anymore! Somebody else took her place! Weird! Now there\u2019s a really cool-looking turtle there. I wonder who drew that?\u201dHis voice pierced through the cheering, and as people heard the shocking nature of his words, they started to turn around to look at the stone stele. Soon, faces fell, and cries of alarm rang out.That in turn caused more people to spin around in shock. Expressions of disbelief could be seen as more and more people began to stare at the text on the first stone stele.\u201cTh-th\u2026 somebody actually passed up Elder Sister Zhou on the first stone stele!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! Heavens! Somebody surpassed Elder Sister Zhou, and with that ugly-looking turtle. Who could it be?!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s actually somebody who can pose a challenge to Elder Sister Zhou in terms of skill with plants and vegetation? This is ground-breaking!! Elder Sister Zhou just took first place on the ninth stone stele, but she still only has a total of eight first place positions!\u201dEveryone was in an uproar, and the sounds of discussion filled the air. Moments ago, everyone had been cheering Zhou Xinqi, and could not possibly have been prepared for something unexpected like this to happen.Bai Xiaochun stood there in the crowd, so pleased with himself that he almost started laughing. However, he knew that doing so wouldn\u2019t be very appropriate, so he held himself back. Instead, he cried out in shock like everyone else around him.Actually, he had never had even the slightest clue that he could actually take first place.It was at this point that Zhou Xinqi, who had just been on the verge of leaving, suddenly trembled where she stood. After hearing the cries echoing out around her, her phoenix-like eyes turned to look at the first stone stele, and she saw the turtle in the first place spot.At first she frowned, but then her expression calmed. In fact, she wasn\u2019t even shocked at all. As far as she was concerned, when she had taken first place in the test of the first volume of plants and vegetation, it had been just after she was promoted into the Outer Sect. Back then, she hadn\u2019t tried as hard as she could have when she took the test, and that was not to mention the advancement she had made since then.\u201cNot bad,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cIt looks like there might be a new rising star in the sect.\u201d With that, her body flickered as she shot toward the first stone stele.In her mind, this was a simple matter. The moment someone exceeded her, she would take back what was hers.Her movement immediately caused a ripple of excitement to run through the crowd of disciples. All of them stared in anticipation as Zhou Xinqi walked into the log cabin to take the test for the first volume of plants and vegetation.\u201cElder Sister Zhou is going to take back the first place spot which rightfully belongs to her! Whichever Junior Brother drew that turtle seems pretty good. What a pity that he\u2019ll only be able to stay in first place for the time it takes an incense stick to burn.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s how it should be. He\u2019s definitely Chosen when it comes to plants and vegetation. He\u2019s just unlucky to have encountered Elder Sister Zhou.\u201dAfter hearing what everyone was saying, Bai Xiaochun started feeling nervous. Not only had he run out of time, but Zhou Xinqi was simply too famous.Even he himself was starting to think that maybe he belonged in second place.\u201cAh, that\u2019s fine too,\u201d he consoled himself. \u201cIf I get in second place, then second place it is. Men shouldn\u2019t be fighting women anyway!\u201d He wanted to leave, but couldn\u2019t quite make himself do so. He couldn\u2019t stop wondering about whether or not he would lose out on what he had just won.Soon, enough time had passed for an incense stick to burn, and the name list hadn\u2019t changed. Bai Xiaochun was still in first place, and Zhou Xinqi was now walking out from inside the log cabin. Her expression was calm, and she was completely confident, having used eighty percent of her skill to piece together 4,000 of the total of 10,000 medicinal plants.From her perspective, she had already outclassed all the other naturally gifted disciples.However, as soon as she walked out, she realized that not a sound could be heard. In fact, all eyes were staring at her with strange expressions. There were even looks of shock.She looked around blankly, then turned to inspect the stone stele. It was at this point that she realized that the magic bottle which represented her name was still beneath the ugly turtle.Everything was dead quiet, and all the surrounding disciples, even Bai Xiaochun, were staring with gaping jaws. Bai Xiaochun then looked over at Zhou Xinqi and realized that, other than being quite good-looking\u2026 maybe she wasn\u2019t that special after all.Zhou Xinqi\u2019s eyes narrowed briefly, and then her expression returned to normal.\u201cThis person really has some talent with plants and vegetation. Now I\u2019m a bit curious to find out who he is.\u201d Her body flickered and she once again entered the log cabin.This time, Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even think about leaving. He stood there in the crowd, holding his breath in anticipation. The surrounding Outer Sect disciples were no longer discussing the matter in loud voices. Instead, they were whispering in hushed tones, watching the unprecedented scene playing out in front of them.Furthermore, many of them were glancing up at the turtle mark, which now seemed utterly mysterious to them. After enough time passed for an incense stick to burn, Zhou Xinqi emerged once again, and that enigmatic sensation increased.The turtle\u2026 was still on top!Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes went wide, and then he cried out in a loud voice to incite the other disciples: \u201cHeavens, who is this person!?!?\u201dFinally, the crowd, which had been silent up until now, exploded with conversation.\u201cElder Sister Zhou tried twice and yet didn\u2019t surpass the turtle! How could this be happening? How many medicinal plants did that person complete!?\u201d\u201cDid anybody see which Elder Brother it was that just took the test?\u201dZhou Xinqi stood beneath the stone stele, frowning. Just now, she had used all the skill she possessed to piece together 6,000 plants. She could never have imagined that she would still be stuck in second place.Her eyes narrowed, and she gave a cold harrumph as she spun and walked back into the log cabin, a very serious look in her eyes.After enough time passed for an incense stick to burn, she emerged again, her expression grave. She turned yet again and went back in, and the same amount of time passed before she emerged, face pale. Expression staunch, she once again entered.Once. Twice. Three times. Four times\u2026.The surrounding cultivators were panting as they watched Zhou Xinqi try over and over again. However, the end result was that everyone lapsed into complete silence.The scene playing out in front of them was terrifying. They could never have possibly imagined that whoever owned the turtle insignia could have pieced together so many medicinal plants, and so thoroughly surpassed Zhou Xinqi.As of that moment, everyone was completely thunderstruck by the turtle.That was especially true of Zhou Xinqi, who once again emerged, her beautiful eyes shot with blood. Everyone in the audience gasped.Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but clear his throat. Right now, he couldn\u2019t just blurt out that he was the person in first place. However, the desire to do that very thing itched in his heart like a restless cat. Actually, it was a wonderful feeling.\u201cNow\u2019s not the time,\u201d he thought. \u201cI\u2019ll find an opportunity in the future to make a big scene in front of everybody. I\u2019ll make sure everyone knows that the person who holds the first place spot on the first stone stele is none other than me, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d Looking up, he realized that it was getting dark, and yawned, looking like the picture of a lonely hero.\u201cIn the twinkling of an eye, I, Bai Xiaochun, reduced Zhou Xinqi to nothing more than ash\u2026.\u201d With that, he flicked his sleeve and turned, walking away through the crowd.As he departed, Zhou Xinqi gritted her teeth, and stubbornly entered the log cabin to once again take the test for the first volume of plants and vegetation\u2026.Eventually, the moon hung high in the sky, and Zhou Xinqi stood there, completely exhausted as she stared up at the turtle. She could never have predicted that a day like this would come, that something like this would happen.The crowds departed, and word of the turtle became the talk of Fragrant Cloud Peak.One would think that the matter was over, but the next day, as the sun shone down onto the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion, the disciples were shocked to see Zhou Xinqi return and once again go into the first stone stele\u2019s log cabin. Yet again, she failed, over and over.One day, two days, three days\u2026. For a full three days, she never gave up. Soon, the gossip about the turtle disciple had reached a fever pitch in Fragrant Cloud Peak.There was not a single person who hadn\u2019t heard about the matter, and even the Inner Sect disciples were talking about it.Seven days later, Zhou Xinqi stood beneath the stone stele, staring up listlessly at the turtle. She had tried over and over again during the past seven days. She had held nothing back, and had even pushed herself to the point of piecing together 7,000 plants. However, she still couldn\u2019t surpass that mysterious disciple.\u201cJust who are you?!\u201d she murmured. Finally, she took a deep breath, gritted her teeth, and turned to leave. She would no longer attempt to compete over the first stele. However, the image of that turtle was now burned deeply into her psyche.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he missed the delicious food he had access to back in the Ovens, everything else was quite satisfactory.In terms of his progress in cultivation, and his research into plants and vegetation, he truly felt as if he was living life to the fullest. The only downside was that his courtyard residence was relatively remote, and there was no one around to chat with, so he got bored sometimes.\u201cCould it be that all cultivators are so lonely?\u201d he thought, sighing as he stood there in the courtyard looking up into the sky. Somehow, he felt much older and more grown up.The winds of autumn had passed, and snow had begun to fall occasionally, causing the temperature to drop significantly. Snowflakes drifted about in the air, and the Spiritwinter Bamboo in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s courtyard was growing strong and healthy. They were now taller than Bai Xiaochun himself, and emerald green in color. They were like a splash of spring in the middle of the winter cold.A month had passed since he had taken first place on the first stone stele of plants and vegetation. However, the second volume of plants and vegetation was much more difficult than he\u2019d anticipated, causing his research to slow. But that didn\u2019t change the most important thing to him, which was that Zhou Xinqi never took back the first place spot on the first stone stele. Unfortunately, Bai Xiaochun still felt a lot of pressure to be able to piece together all of the incomplete medicinal plants that he hadn\u2019t been able to before.\u201cI have an amazing reputation now. I can\u2019t let that wench Zhou Xinqi surpass me.\u201d From that moment, Bai Xiaochun decided that he would continue to work harder and harder until he reached his secret goal of being able to proudly announce in front of everyone that he was Apothecary Turtle.Although his progress with the second volume of plants and vegetation was slow, his cultivation of the Undying Live Forever Technique was rapidly nearing the point where he would be able to achieve a full minor circulation.Although the pain only continued to get worse, Bai Xiaochun remained completely focused on the words \u2018undying\u2019 and \u2018live forever\u2019.\u201cThree more days. According to the description of the Undying Live Forever Technique, in three days I\u2019ll be able to complete a minor circulation.\u201d Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, gritted his teeth, and continued to speed around his courtyard, simultaneously studying the second volume of plants and vegetation.The three days passed by quickly. On the evening of the third day, it began to snow, covering the Spirit Stream Sect in a blanket of shimmering silver.Bai Xiaochun was in the middle of running when a tremor ran through him, and he suddenly stopped in place. The pain that he had been enduring for the past eighty-one days suddenly vanished.A flow of heat exploded through him, converging on his skin, which felt as if it were broiling in an oven.The snowflakes melted before they could even get near him, instantly transforming into a white mist.\u201cIt worked!\u201d he exclaimed ecstatically, despite his dry throat. Although he felt like he was on fire, when he looked down, he saw a black light flowing over his skin, which circulated around him and then vanished.He then poked his arm with his right hand, and could tell how incredibly tough it was. His eyes shone, and shook his arms and legs a bit. Instantly, he could tell that he was much faster than before. He started to run forward, then let out a cry of shock as he appeared several meters away in the blink of an eye.He could now move twice as fast as he could before. Completely delighted, Bai Xiaochun ran around a bit to test out his new speed, and was very satisfied.Without any further hesitation, he used the Undying Live Forever Technique mnemonic to continue practicing cultivation. This new method involved closing his mouth and nose and then attempting to breathe through his skin. An inhalation and exhalation counted as a minor cycle. He needed to practice eighty-one minor cycles per day for eighty-one days to complete a minor circulation.If he could accomplish that, then, combined with the painful minor circulation he had already completed, he would have made his initial success in acquiring the Undying Skin.After practicing a few times, Bai Xiaochun got the knack of it and struggled to get through one minor cycle. Afterward, his body seemed much more gaunt.He also felt incredibly hungry, and gurgling sounds could be heard coming from his stomach. He ignored that, and continued breathing, causing his body to get even skinnier. After breathing in and out fifteen times, his body looked like nothing more than a bag of bones.It was as if all the nutrients that existed inside of him had been sucked out of him. However, his skin looked even more resilient than before.Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t hold on any longer. His vision was fading, and his eyes had turned green from the indescribable hunger which filled him. He was so hungry that he could eat an elephant in a single bite.\u201cThis isn\u2019t working, I\u2019m starving to death!!\u201d He looked around, salivating, only to realize that there was nothing in the area to eat except for the verdant bamboo he was growing, which at the moment looked quite attractive.Unable to hold back because of the incredible hunger, he flashed over to the Spiritwinter Bamboo and took a big bite out of one of them.Crunching sounds could be heard as he ripped out a huge chunk and began to chomp it down. After swallowing, his face twisted, and he shivered from the bitter flavor.\u201cToo bitter\u2026. I need to eat some real food\u2026.\u201d He suddenly missed the Ovens more than ever. Never before in his life had he ever been this hungry, so hungry that he felt like he was going to faint. His eyes were turning even more green, and he was panting. Finally, he bolted out of the courtyard.Racing down the mountain path at top speed, he would occasionally encounter other Outer Sect disciples. To them, it felt like a wind was blowing past their bodies, and they turned in shock to stare at Bai Xiaochun running off into the distance.He raced down the mountain, into the servants\u2019 district and straight toward the Ovens. Not wanting to waste time opening the door, he flew over the main gate.The Ovens crew was in the middle of cooking. Now that Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei were gone, Second Fatty Huang had become the leader. He was currently ladling out some rice gruel into a bowl, when suddenly a wind blasted in his face, and the bowl was gone, to be replaced by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s gaping mouth.\u201cHuh?\u201d Second Fatty Huang was startled, and stood there gaping for a moment. Before anybody could say anything, Bai Xiaochun grabbed one of the nearby woks and began to guzzle it down. Apparently that wasn\u2019t enough, because he then simply dunked his head into the wok, draining the rice gruel\u2026.One wok, two woks, three woks\u2026. Bai Xiaochun rapidly drank down a hundred woks of gruel. He was like a bottomless pit, and still didn\u2019t feel close to being full.\u201cStill hungry! This isn\u2019t working! I\u2019m so hungry\u2026 I need meat!\u201d He looked around frantically and quickly caught sight of the mountains of meat that were his Elder Brothers.The fatties of the Ovens stared at Bai Xiaochun in shock. They had seen hungry people before, but had never seen someone this hungry. It was like the ghost of a person who had died from starvation.Then they realized that he was staring at them and salivating. Second Fatty Huang suddenly backed up rapidly, simultaneously shouting, \u201cNinth Fatty, quickly, there\u2019s some spirit food in the kitchen that we prepared for Elder Zhou!\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes gleamed, and he immediately charged toward the kitchen.Outside, Second Fatty Huang and the others exchanged dismayed glances.\u201cDid you see that? That\u2019s the fate in store for people who become Outer Sect disciples. Look at how hungry little Junior Brother is\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou could beat me to death before I agree to become an Outer Sect disciple!\u201d The other fatties were all completely determined to hold fast to their decision, although they felt bad for Bai Xiaochun.At the moment, Bai Xiaochun was doing his best to control himself and abide by the six lines of truth from the Ovens. He would only nibble the edges, and not eat the entire item. After all, if he broke the rules, that could implicate his Elder Brothers, which was something he would never do.After drinking the gruel and nibbling the edges of the spirit food, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hunger had been reduced a bit. He could deal with it now, so he walked out of the kitchen, wanting to cry but not able to find any tears. This Undying Live Forever Technique was far too terrifying. Although he didn\u2019t have to deal with any pain now, the hunger was enough to drive a person mad.\u201cSecond Elder Brother\u2026.\u201d he said, looking nervously at Second Fatty Huang.Seeing that Bai Xiaochun looked normal again, Second Fatty Huang finally felt relieved. He walked up and patted him on the shoulder in sympathy.\u201cLittle Junior Brother, don\u2019t worry. Thankfully, we were already preparing some food for Elder Zhou. Look at how hungry you are! Ai. From now, you come back more often to fill up, alright?\u201dBai Xiaochun was very moved. However, he gritted his teeth and decided that he would do the opposite. After all, one day if he ever reached the point where he lost control, he might end up clearing out the entire Ovens\u2026.Second Fatty Huang and the others escorted him out, and Bai Xiaochun sighed continuously as he trekked back up Fragrant Cloud Peak. All of a sudden, the wonderful, carefree feeling from before was gone, replaced by despair. He really was scared of starving himself to death now.\u201cI wonder if there really were some Spirit Stream Sect disciples who died from starvation in the past. I definitely don\u2019t want to be the first.\u201d Scowling miserably, he was in the middle of trying to figure out how to resolve the food and hunger issue when suddenly he heard a rooster crowing off in the distance.The sound caused him to pause in place and slowly turn his head to stare in the direction of the crowing.\u201cChickens\u2026.\u201d Looking around to ensure that nobody was watching him, he ducked into a nearby thicket, vanishing with a whoosh. Then he began to slink along like a weasel.Moments later, he appeared outside the fence that surrounded Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s spirit fowl farm. Inside were a group of chickens strutting around arrogantly, as large as calfs, with three-colored tails. Bai Xiaochun eyed them with glistening eyes, and began to salivate.\u201cMeat\u2026.\u201d he murmured, then began to chuckle, a strange sound that, when coupled with his wide smile, was completely terrifying.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 20: Feathers Scattered AbouPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20: Feathers Scattered AboutSpirit Tail Chickens were far larger than ordinary chickens. They had very resilient feathers and extremely ferocious temperaments. After reaching full maturity, they were comparable to the second level of Qi Condensation.Not only was their meat edible, so were their eggs. Their blood and bones could be added to medicines, and when you burned their tails, they could create rare, three-colored flames. Because of all that, large amounts of Spirit Tail Chickens were being raised in all of the three mountains on the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect.However, they did not actually belong to the sect itself. Instead, they were the personal property of Li Qinghou and the Peak Lords of the other two mountain peaks, who assigned certain disciples to raise them and take care of them. On Fragrant Cloud Peak, there were three areas specially set aside to breed them.Bai Xiaochun crouched in the thicket looking at the Spirit Tail Chickens. Back when he had worked in the Ovens, he had never seen the chickens live, but had eaten their meat and knew it was delicious. Furthermore, Big Fatty Zhang had mentioned that they loved to eat spirit insects.After observing the chickens for a while, Bai Xiaochun flickered into motion. He did not do anything rash, but instead went back down the mountain, where he spent some spirit stones to buy some spirit insects, after which he returned to his courtyard residence.By the time he got back, he was so hungry that he had to fight not to faint, and immediately began to look around for something to eat.It didn\u2019t take long for his gaze to fall upon the Spiritwinter Bamboo, whereupon his eyes began to shine. The bamboo stalks were already around three meters tall, and thick as a fist. From the spirit glow they emanated, they seemed far beyond ordinary.Bai Xiaochun immediately hurried over and began to walk around the bamboo stalks, laughing heartily as he studied them closely. Based on what he had studied about plants and vegetation, he was quickly able to identify the toughest among the various stalks, which he cut off at the base and then sliced in half.When it came to stealing chickens, Bai Xiaochun had a very special method. The key lay in the word \u2018steal\u2019 itself. Being able to get the chickens without anyone noticing was an art form.He quickly used some of the bamboo to craft a device called a bamboo cicada.He had learned how to make bamboo cicadas from his father when he was young. Supposedly, they were effective in catching all sorts of creatures from chickens to phoenixes. Once the bamboo cicada itself was finished, he used some strips of bamboo to weave a cord. After finishing that, he tested out the cord\u2019s strength, tied it to the bamboo cicada, then flew out into the darkness of night.\u201cI\u2019m gonna eat chicken!!\u201d His stomach grumbled, but his eyes were shining with a green light. Because of how starving he was, he moved even faster than normal, and soon arrived at the Spirit Tail Chicken farm.As he neared, he tiptoed up to the fence, placed a spirit insect onto the bamboo cicada, then threw the bamboo cicada over the fence. Next, he crouched hungrily off to the side, holding the cord, which was attached to the cicada.Further inside the fence were some log cabins, where certain Outer Sect disciples resided and practiced cultivation. The chicken farm was quite large, with over a hundred Spirit Tail Chickens, most of whom were laying on the ground. A few were walking about, occasionally sticking their heads up haughtily and looking around. After a bit of time passed, one of the Spirit Tail Chickens seemed to have noticed something. It turned and looked at something a ways away, then walked over. It immediately saw the spirit insect sitting there, prompting it to peck its beak down to grab it.However, as soon as the Spirit Tail Chicken pecked at the spirit insect, right at the critical moment, the bent piece of bamboo snapped open, ingeniously forcing the Spirit Tail Chicken\u2019s beak open.The Spirit Tail Chicken wanted to cry out, but its beak was stuck open, and it couldn\u2019t emit any sounds. Then it tried to close its beak and crush the bamboo, but the bamboo was too resilient, and its efforts were in vain.No matter how the Spirit Tail Chicken struggled, it couldn\u2019t make a peep as it was quickly dragged toward the fence, then up and over, straight into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hands. Bai Xiaochun quickly drew upon the power of the fourth level of Qi Condensation, sending massive amounts of force into his hands, which he used to snap the chicken\u2019s neck. Then he tossed it into his bag of holding. From the way he moved, it seemed he was quite a veteran when it came to this sort of thing.The entire affair took only about thirty breaths of time, and most of that time had been spent lying in wait. Were it not for that, it would have been accomplished even faster.Bai Xiaochun raced excitedly back to his courtyard residence, whereupon a fragrant aroma soon filled the air. By dawn, the entire chicken was now in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s belly.The only thing left were the feathers and the bones scattered about\u2026.After eating the entire Spirit Tail Chicken, most of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hunger was abated. Having replenished his body, he now felt quite warm and comfortable.In fact, he even seemed to have a bit more spiritual energy inside. However, the most apparent change had to do with his Undying Live Forever Technique. Bai Xiaochun immediately began to breathe in and out, for roughly eight cycles.With every inhalation and exhalation, pulsating warmth would spread through his body and then converge on his skin. That in turn caused his skin to become tougher and more resilient. It even flickered with a black light. However, if you looked closely, it was just as fair and clear as before.\u201cThe Undying Live Forever Technique starts with pain, then moves to hunger. This type of cultivation is definitely quite difficult, however, the results are excellent.\u201d With that, he extended his right hand, within which appeared his wooden sword. Then, he carefully and softly tapped the blade onto the back of his hand.The wooden sword had a twofold spirit enhancement, but when it touched his skin, Bai Xiaochun could sense a faint force of resistance. He ceased any testing, more convinced than ever that he needed to continue cultivating the Undying Live Forever Technique.\u201cAccording to the description, the Undying Skin has four stages: gold, silver, copper, and iron. Right now I\u2019ve just started. But if I can last for eighty-one days\u2026 I should be able to develop Undying Iron Skin.\u201d Bai Xiaochun looked around at the scattered chicken bones, and in his heart, he now realized what was the key to successfully cultivating the Undying Iron Skin.\u201cThankfully, there are plenty of Spirit Tail Chickens on the mountain,\u201d he thought, laughing heartily. He was now more interested in the Spirit Tail Chickens than ever.What he didn\u2019t know was that in the past 10,000 years in the Spirit Stream Sect, very few people had ever cultivated the Undying Live Forever Technique. Most who did ended up quitting during the terrifying torment that was the first eighty-one days. Although some managed to continue, the main problem after that was how much money it cost to keep going.In order to cultivate the technique all the way to the stage of Undying Gold Skin, the expenditure involved was simply terrifying. Even an entire sect would have a hard time forking over so much. After all, those resources could be used on other, less wasteful techniques. Although those other techniques weren\u2019t as marvelous, a sect had to consider what was most cost-effective.That was the main reason why the Undying Live Forever Technique had ended up gathering dust in the Scripture Pavilion.After practicing cultivation for a bit, Bai Xiaochun gathered up the chicken bones and buried them in the nearby spirit soil, along with the feathers.Then he left his courtyard residence and found a place where the Outer Sect disciples tended to congregate, where he eavesdropped a bit to see if anyone was talking about the chicken being stolen. Based on his experience stealing chickens back in his village, he knew that the most optimal method was to only strike once every few days.After eavesdropping a bit, he didn\u2019t hear anyone mention anything about a missing chicken. However, during his eavesdropping, he also learned that the three-colored tail feathers of the Spirit Tail Chickens could be used to kindle three-colored flames.Having learned this, Bai Xiaochun immediately trotted back to his courtyard residence and dug up the three-colored tail feathers out of the spirit soil. Then he sat there, studying them thoughtfully.\u201cNo wonder they raise so many Spirit Tail Chickens here.\u201d He immediately stored the three-colored feathers in his bag of holding. To others, such feathers were nothing more than kindling for three-colored flames. To him, though, they were fuel to perform threefold spirit enhancements.He didn\u2019t attempt to do so immediately, though. His plan was to get some spirit medicine first, then perform a spirit enhancement to make the medicine more powerful.After resting for a few days, Bai Xiaochun started getting hungry again one night. He put down the second volume of plants and vegetation and headed out into the darkness of night. When he returned, he had two more Spirit Tail Chickens in his bag of holding.And that was how time passed by. Soon, a month had gone by, during which time, news about the missing Spirit Tail Chickens began to spread on Fragrant Cloud Peak.Even Li Qinghou heard about the matter. After all, in only a month of time, a few dozen chickens had gone missing from the three Spirit Tail Chicken farms. However, Li Qinghou didn\u2019t pay much attention to the matter, as he had important affairs to handle which ended up taking him off of the mountain.Most depressed of all were the seven or eight Outer Sect disciples in charge of raising the Spirit Tail Chickens. It wasn\u2019t that they cared a lot for the chickens themselves, but rather, that the chickens weren\u2019t really theirs to begin with. Although the Peak Lord didn\u2019t say anything, they felt the matter to be a big loss of face. After all, whoever was stealing the chickens was doing it right under their noses.However, there was nothing they could do about it. No matter what they did to try to protect the chickens, the chickens kept going missing. What was most puzzling of all was that the chickens went missing without a trace. Not even a sound could be heard, as if they had vanished into thin air.By now, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s body was now completely back to normal, and in fact, he had even gained a bit of weight. However much the Undying Live Forever Technique sucked away from him, he would replenish it with chicken meat. His face had a healthy flush, and he was once again living a comfortable life.He was in a wonderful mood, and his belly was full. As a result, his research into the second volume of plants and vegetation picked up speed. Eventually, the day arrived when he was finished studying. Based on what had happened last time, he had studied everything in even more minute detail, including the leaves, stems, roots, veins, and even the tiny hairs on the surface of the plants. He was now more confident than ever, and was sure that even if the plants were split into dozens of parts, he would still be able to identify them.Chest puffed out proudly, he strode out of his courtyard residence.\u201cThis time, I\u2019m going to make sure everybody knows that I am the Lord Turtle who passed up Zhou Xinqi!\u201d Filled with anticipation, he headed straight for the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 21: Big Bro Xiaochun....Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 21: Big Bro Xiaochun\u2026.The 10,000 Medicines Pavilion was one of the most lively locations on Fragrant Cloud Peak. Virtually every day, crowds of Outer Sect disciples came and went. One reason was because of the ten stone steles, and the other reason was because of the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion itself, which was located in the middle of all those stone steles. That was where you could exchange merit points for medicinal plants and pill formulas.Every so often there were also tests for promotion to journeyman apothecary, or occasions when the medicinal pills concocted by various disciples were bought back by the sect. For a variety of reasons, the area was almost always a boiling cauldron of voices.Because of the lively nature of the place, it had eventually become a place to talk about the latest news. Although it had started as an exchange of information about plants and vegetation, eventually, everything in the sect came to be talked about. Big things, small things, even random gossip was all passed among the various disciples.When Bai Xiaochun arrived, the place was packed. Some people were coming and going, but about thirty to fifty percent of the disciples were standing around talking. There were also disciples lined up to challenge the stone steles and earn a place on the name lists.Bai Xiaochun squeezed through the crowds for a while before finally nearing the second stone stele. Just when he was about to walk up to the stele itself, he happened to overhear three Outer Sect disciples up ahead talking about him.\u201cDid you guys hear? Something really weird has been going on in the sect recently. Someone has been specifically stealing Peak Lord Li\u2019s Spirit Tail Chickens! Supposedly, over a hundred have already gone missing.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean a hundred? I heard that it won\u2019t be long before Peak Lord Li doesn\u2019t have any chickens left at all. The disciples in charge of the Spirit Tail Chicken farm have put him on the most wanted list. They even said that when they catch him, they\u2019re going to chop him up and feed him to the chickens!\u201d\u201cDefinitely weird. Why are all these prodigies showing up in Fragrant Cloud Peak all of a sudden? First there was the mysterious turtle, and now this mighty chicken bandit!\u201dBai Xiaochun subconsciously hunched his shoulders guiltily. After all, he\u2019d done nothing more than steal a few chickens, right? Who would have known that it would cause such a stir? From the look of it, almost everybody knew.Furthermore, when he realized that the Spirit Tail Chickens actually belonged to Li Qinghou, he got even more scared.\u201cGee, I didn\u2019t steal THAT many,\u201d he thought. He almost felt like he was being framed. Just as he was trying to think of a way to change public opinion about the matter of the mighty chicken bandit, he heard the sound of a commotion from behind him.\u201cHey girly, what\u2019s with the shoving? Are you late to be reincarnated or something?!\u201d\u201cSo what if I\u2019m shoving, huh? There\u2019s nothing special about you. If you\u2019re afraid of crowds, what\u2019d you come here for anyway? You should feel lucky to get shoved by a girl like me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026.\u201dFor some reason, the voice sounded familiar to Bai Xiaochun. He turned to see a fair, delicate young woman standing there, chest puffed up, hand on her hip as she arrogantly stared down a burly-looking fellow.\u201cHou Xiaomei?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, blinking.The young woman was indeed Hou Xiaomei, and when she heard his voice, she turned over and saw him, and the arrogance on her face quickly transformed into joy.\u201cBig bro Xiaochun, it\u2019s you!\u201d she exclaimed, turning and hurrying in his direction. Before she even arrived, Bai Xiaochun felt her hot, pure aura brushing past his face.\u201cHey, chaste little sister,\u201d he replied, looking over the vivacious and charming Hou Xiaomei. 1Hou Xiaomei\u2019s face flushed a bit in response to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words.\u201cOh, stop it, big bro Xiaochun!\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cYou\u2019re such a tease, just call me Hou Xiaomei!\u201dAnd just like that, the previously bristling young woman was suddenly beautiful and charming. Quite a few surrounding Outer Sect disciples\u2019 eyes began to gleam. As for the burly man she had just been arguing with, he suddenly had goosebumps as he realized what a moody and temperamental girl she was.\u201cBig bro Xiaochun,\u201d she gushed, \u201cmy big brother left the mountain and hasn\u2019t come back, and this is my first time here. Where do I go to get the second volume of plants and vegetation?\u201d This really was her first time here. Before, her older brother had helped her handle everything, and now that she was on her own, she didn\u2019t know what to do. Luckily, she ran right into Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun smiled as he explained the process to her, going into minute detail. Hou Xiaomei nodded occasionally. By the time he finished explaining, she not only felt that he was a good person, she also felt that he was also extremely knowledgable.After finishing, Bai Xiaochun looked at Hou Xiaomei to ensure that she had no further questions. Then he pointed over at the first stone stele, the one which tested the first volume of plants and vegetation, and calmly said, \u201cSee that stone stele? All the people who leave their mark at the top of the list are like Chosen in the sect. Any one of those people are the type who will shake the whole cultivation world in the future.\u201cI won\u2019t go into all the names, just the second one on the list. See that magic bottle insignia? That represents one of the female Chosen here on Fragrant Cloud Peak, Zhou Xinqi!\u201d\u201cZhou Xinqi!\u201d exclaimed Hou Xiaomei, her eyes shining as she looked over at the magic bottle insignia. \u201cSo, that magic bottle stands for the Peak Lord\u2019s apprentice, the one with the plants and vegetation spirit meridian, Elder Sister Zhou, who\u2019s destined to join the Inner Sect!\u201d From the way Hou Xiaomei talked about Zhou Xinqi, it was obvious that she held her in immense esteem. Hearing Bai Xiaochun\u2019s explanation about the magic bottle symbol seemed to get her even more excited.Bai Xiaochun continued to explain matters placidly for a bit longer, until he noticed that Hou Xiaomei seemed to be completely fixated on the magic bottle, and wasn\u2019t paying attention at all to the turtle which had obviously surpassed it. He felt a bit irritated; after all, hadn\u2019t the whole point of his explanation been to get her to notice the turtle?\u201cAhem, well, Zhou Xinqi is definitely amazing, that\u2019s why she was able to get to second place on the first stone stele of plants and vegetation!\u201d He made sure to especially emphasize the words \u2018second place.\u2019Hou Xiaomei gaped for a moment, then frowned.\u201cSecond place? Who does that turtle above Elder Sister Zhou represent? It looks so ugly.\u201dHearing this, Bai Xiaochun felt much happier. In his mind, he really did need to educate Hou Xiaomei a little bit more. Putting on a very solemn demeanor, he began to speak in a very earnest tone.\u201cYou\u2019re wrong there, Xiaomei. Did you know that the cool-looking turtle actually represents the most mysterious, admirable and transcendent disciple in the entire sect?\u201cThere are many legends about this person. Whenever he appears, he causes a huge uproar in the sect, and is the center of all attention. Countless disciples follow his every move, envy him and even cheer out loud for him.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Hou Xiaomei was a simple and pure girl, and the things Bai Xiaochun was saying caused her to stare in skeptical shock.\u201cYou should know that two months ago, this disciple made a big splash when he destroyed Zhou Xinqi\u2019s hopes of having the first place spot on all nine stone steles!\u201cYou should know that in his debut appearance, he took the first place spot in the first stone stele. He did it as easily as flipping over his hand.\u201cYou should know that Zhou Xinqi personally witnessed it happen. For the following seven days, she neither slept nor rested. She challenged the stone stele over and over again, but even after she did everything she could, she was still in second place, and was forced to concede defeat.\u201cYou should know that I, Bai Xiaochun\u2026 ahem\u201d Bai Xiaochun was getting very excited, and in the end, he wanted to reveal himself as the mighty Lord Turtle, but held back at the last moment. The ideal time to reveal his identity was in front of a big crowd. To do so in front of just a single young girl was too much of a waste.\u201cThat\u2019s all true?\u201d Hou Xiaomei asked, eyes shining as brightly as glittering stars on a moonless night. She was now staring at the little turtle, her flushed face the picture of adoration.\u201cOf course it\u2019s true,\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied, sighing inwardly. In his mind, he had just done a very good thing, which was helping straighten the course of a child who had strayed off onto the wrong path. Feeling quite a sense of accomplishment, he swished his sleeve and ignored Hou Xiaomei\u2019s adoration as he headed toward the second stone stele.He elbowed his way through the crowd, then waited for a bit until he was next in line. He had to wait a while for one of the log cabins to empty up, after which he strode into the door and disappeared.The log cabin looked the same inside as the last one he had been in. After drawing a turtle, his vision swam, and rumbling sounds filled his ears. When he could see again, he was once again in that familiar empty space. No cold voice spoke out this time; instead, the fragmented plants and vegetation immediately appeared in front of him.Since Bai Xiaochun had been prepared for this, his eyes shone and his hands sped to work. In the blink of an eye, one spirit plant after another was pieced together.Time passed. When the incense stick\u2019s worth of time was up, there were less than 5,000 plants left, which was significantly better than the record he had set when he had first been tested for the time it takes an incense stick to burn.Unfortunately, time was up. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s vision swam, and when he could see clearly, he was back in the log cabin. Despite having come up slightly short, he was still completely confident in the results. Quickly snatching up the third volume of plants and vegetation, he turned and walked out of the door of the log cabin, heart pounding in anticipation.Outside, he could see countless Outer Sect disciples, many of whom were looking up at the name list. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s currently felt very heroic.\u201cThis time I\u2019m going to shake the entire sect! I\u2019m going to make sure that everyone knows Bai Xiaochun is the famous Lord Turtle!\u201d He could envision what it would be like to the object of adoration of tens of thousands of disciples, and could already see the look of shock on Hou Xiaomei\u2019s face.When he thought about that, Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t hold back from laughing loudly. Then he lifted his hand grandly, and was just about to shout out at the top of his lungs that he was the mighty Lord Turtle, when\u2026All of a sudden, a voice rang out from among the Outer Sect disciples lined up for the trial by fire.\u201cDo you think the little turtle who stole Elder Sister Zhou\u2019s limelight will dare to make an appearance?\u201d\u201cI doubt it. Elder Sister Zhou\u2019s fans are crazy. I heard that they\u2019ve been searching the entire south bank for the little turtle. They even spread word that as soon as they find him, they\u2019ll skin him alive\u2026.\u201d\u201cI heard that too. There are even some Inner Sect disciples who\u2019ve joined in on the search.\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s hand hung in the air as he listened to what the people were saying. Suddenly, his heart began to tremble. When he heard that there were Inner Sect disciples looking for him too, his forehead began to drip with sweat, and he quickly scratched his head, and then dropped his hand as if nothing at all had happened.Enraged, he wormed his way through the crowd, an anxious, bereaved expression on his face.\u201cThis is ridiculous. They\u2019re pushing things too far. All I did was take first place, right? And now the Inner Sect disciples are involved? Was it worth it?\u201d This time, his expression was real, and not the least bit pretend.Almost as soon as he worked his way into the crowd, someone noticed that the name list on the second stone stele had changed, and immediately, a huge uproar ensued.1. This exchange involves some wordplay that\u2019s impossible to translate directly. Hou Xiaomei\u2019s name literally means \u201clittle sister,\u201d so it would be silly to call her \u201clittle sister little sister.\u201d Instead he literally calls her by his own name, although it comes across sounding kind of funny and/or flirtatiousPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That little turtle\u2026 it\u2019s showed up again!!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in first place again! Just who is this little turtle? Whoever it is has taken two first place spots in a row!\u201d\u201cNow Elder Sister Zhou doesn\u2019t have eight first place spots, she only has seven!\u201dThe Outer Sect disciples were in a complete uproar, and countless cries of alarm could be heard ringing about. However, there was one voice in the crowd, a girl, who was crying out excitedly.\u201cGo, little turtle, go!\u201d That young woman was none other than Hou Xiaomei. Thanks to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s earlier prodding, she was now a huge fan of the little turtle. Now that she suddenly saw the little turtle take two first place spots, her sense of adoration increased rapidly. In fact, the little turtle had now surpassed Zhou Xinqi\u2019s place in her heart.The sound of commotion rolled in waves, until everyone was shouting out. After all, the little turtle really was very famous, and now it had once again proven by its actions that whoever it represented was qualified to challenge Zhou Xinqi.In fact, there were even some people who were starting to anticipate the scene of the little turtle surpassing Zhou Xinqi in all ten stone steles.Bai Xiaochun was there in the crowd, still a bit depressed, but also secretly felt pleased with himself. He was only a bit regretful that nobody knew who he was.\u201cHmph. One of these days, I\u2019m going to reveal that I\u2019m Lord Turtle in front of an even bigger crowd!\u201d he promised himself.Despite his oath, he wasn\u2019t ready to give up just yet. He next began to participate in all the shouting. Occasionally, a piercing voice would ring out, drawing the crowd into further commotion.\u201cHeavens! Who could it be!? I love this guy!\u201d\u201cThe idol of the masses! Lord Turtle is invincible!\u201dThanks to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s piercing cries, the Outer Sect disciples\u2019 discussions grew even more feverish. However, it was in that instant that a cold snort rang out, and a figure leapt out of the crowd to stand atop one of the log cabins.It was a young man with a cold, grim expression on his face. His icy voice rang out across the crowd as he said, \u201cI better not find out who that damned little turtle is. If I do, he\u2019ll regret ever having stolen the limelight from Junior Sister Zhou!\u201d\u201cSame here! The little turtle is probably hiding in the crowd right now. I\u2019m gonna find him!\u201d The second voice belonged to that of another young man, who also flew up to the roof of the log cabin and looked around coldly at the crowd. Apparently he had his eye on Bai Xiaochun, not because he thought that he was the little turtle, but because Bai Xiaochun\u2019s shouting earlier had been quite blatant, and irritated the young man.Soon, more people began to say similar things, seven or eight of them. Furthermore, when they unleashed the incredible power of their cultivation bases, it was obvious that the strongest among their number was in the seventh level of Qi Condensation.These people were obviously fans of Zhou Xinqi, and famous ones at that. Their appearance on the scene caused the crowd to immediately quiet down and stop discussing the matter. However, inwardly, most people were irritated at what was happening, and loathed the young men more than ever.Although everyone liked Zhou Xinqi, she was only a single person. The disciples present weren\u2019t stupid, and actually admired someone who could challenge Zhou Xinqi based on individual merit.When Bai Xiaochun found himself the subject of the young man\u2019s glare, he didn\u2019t feel very confident. However, after considering that there were so many bystanders who the young man didn\u2019t dare to offend, Bai Xiaochun glared back with a look that said, \u201cIf you dare to do something to me, I\u2019ll fight back to the death.\u201dAt this point in the standoff, a beam of light shot through the air in the direction of the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion, within which a graceful figure could be seen. It was none other than Zhou Xinqi.\u201cIt\u2019s Elder Sister Zhou.\u201d\u201cElder Sister Zhou is coming.\u201d The standoff ended. As soon as the Outer Sect disciples caught sight of Zhou Xinqi, smiles broke out on their faces.The seven or eight young men who were her fans quickly retracted their cultivation bases. Looking completely confident and at ease, they clasped hands to Zhou Xinqi.Zhou Xinqi had come because first, she had already heard about the change to the ranking list on the second stone stele, and second, she had another matter to attend to. After glancing around, she easily guessed what had caused the standoff. She looked over at the eight fans, her eyes flickering with displeasure and even disgust.\u201cThe affairs of Zhou Xinqi have not reached the level where others need to interfere,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cBesides, if a new Chosen disciple has appeared on Fragrant Cloud Peak, that\u2019s something fortunate for the sect as a whole. If you people let something like this happen again, then don\u2019t blame your Junior Sister for losing her temper.\u201d Her voice cut with the sharpness of a sword, and the eight fans looked angry. However, they didn\u2019t dare to say a word.Zhou Xinqi looked up at the little turtle on the second stone stele, and her heart filled with an unyielding spirit. She looked out over the crowd and said in a cool, arrogant voice, \u201cWhichever Junior Brother it was who happened to surpass me on the stones steles for the first and second volumes of plants and vegetation, if you\u2019re still scuttling around in the crowd and don\u2019t feel like showing your true face, then so be it. Do as you wish.\u201dThe surrounding Outer Sect disciple cheered in response. For most of them, Zhou Xinqi was the true Chosen of Fragrant Cloud Peak.Bai Xiaochun stood there in the crowd, musing that Zhou Xingqi definitely deserved to be Chosen. Her words just now had been marvelously spoken. He looked up for a moment in thought. He could clearly hear the haughtiness in her words, and what caused him to sigh the most was not that he didn\u2019t want to reveal himself. No, it was the killing intent flickering in the eyes of her adoring fans.Zhou Xinqi\u2019s expression was calm as she coolly addressed the crowd as a whole. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I came here for another reason today, and I hope I can have the support of each and every one of you.\u201dHer words instantly got everyone excited, and everyone waited respectfully to see what she had to say next.\u201cThe tranquility of Fragrant Cloud Peak has been disturbed of late. My Master, Li Qinghou, has had quite a few Spirit Tail Chickens go missing. He is currently out of the sect, and most likely doesn\u2019t care too much about the matter. However, as his apprentice, I have a responsibility to do something about it. I sincerely hope that all my fellow disciples will work hard to catch this chicken thief. If anyone manages to apprehend him, I will personally reward that person with a treasured jade pendant!\u201d Even as she spoke, Zhou Xinqi pulled out a green jade pendant from inside her robe. It let off a gentle glow that made it obvious it was an extraordinary item.\u201cThis is an item I came across some years ago that contains potent defensive power.\u201d As her voice echoed out, the numerous Outer Sect disciples looked at the jade pendant, and excited expressions could be seen on many of their faces. Some even began to call out various promises.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Elder Sister Zhou. That chicken thief won\u2019t have a place to hide!\u201cHow dare he steal the Peak Lord\u2019s chickens! This chicken thief is daring to the extreme. We\u2019ll definitely be paying close attention to the matter!\u201d Soon, almost everyone in the crowd had cried out assurances that they would help, especially Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans, whose eyes burned passionately as they cried out louder than everyone else.Bai Xiaochun stood in the middle of the crowd, somewhat stunned. The surrounding disciples were getting worked up into a frenzy, and he felt like a cold wind was blowing down his spine.However, he still wasn\u2019t willing to give up. Even just thinking about the hunger caused from cultivating the Undying Live Forever Technique caused sweat to bead up on his forehead. His mind raced as he tried to come up with ideas, and a moment later, his eyes lit up. Suddenly, he slapped his chest and projected his voice through the crowd.\u201cElder Sister Zhou, I, Bai Xiaochun, will definitely accomplish this mission, even if I have to climb a mountain of blades or swim to the bottom of a vat of boiling oil. I will catch this chicken thief!\u201d His piercing voice couldn\u2019t be missed, and as he spoke, he shouldered his way forward to stand at the front of the crowd.The way he made his entrance caused numerous eyes to fall upon him, as did the way he loudly slapped his own chest. Even Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans felt a bit overwhelmed, and Zhou Xinqi herself couldn\u2019t help but look over at him.Seeing how much her fellow disciples supported her caused a smile to break out on Zhou Xinqi\u2019s face. She nodded slightly, and was just turning to leave when all of a sudden, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s piercing voice once again weighed down onto the crowd.\u201cElder Sister Zhou, I have a suggestion. Why don\u2019t we form a chicken thief task force? If we work together, it will make it much easier to catch this vile traitor, and protect the Peak Lord\u2019s Spirit Tail Chickens!\u201d From the righteous tone of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s voice, it seemed that he was willing to spare no effort to accomplish the mission set forth by Elder Sister Zhou.Zhou Xinqi stared in shock. As for the rest of the crowd, quite a few of them thought it was a good idea and began to voice their approval.\u201cGood idea,\u201d someone said. \u201cHowever, cultivation is still our main priority, so the matter must be voluntary.\u201d Zhou Xinqi looked over at Bai Xiaochun once more. In her opinion, this Junior Brother of hers was not only fair and pure, he seemed inherently charming. Furthermore, he appeared to be piously devoted to her, which left her with a very favorable impression. Nodding, she gave him a smile.\u201cSince the idea was put forth by this zealous Junior Brother, I suggest that he form the chicken thief task force. Take these ten silk bands to use as tokens of identification for the task force members.\u201d With that, she produced ten bands of blue silk from within her bag of holding. With the wave of a hand, she sent them flying toward Bai Xiaochun, where they landed in his hand.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Elder Sister, I\u2019ll handle everything!\u201d He stood there with silk bands in hand, looking prouder than ever. In fact, he looked like he would yield to no one when it came to the Peak Lord\u2019s chickens, and would even be willing to sacrifice his life for the cause.Zhou Xinqi\u2019s eyes glowed with admiration, and she couldn\u2019t help but muse that there were very few responsible Junior Brothers like this in the sect. Taking one last look at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s charming appearance, she turned and left.Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans were not happy to suddenly see her and Bai Xiaochun on good terms. Furthermore, they also regretted not winning her favor in such a fawning way themselves.After Zhou Xinqi left, the disciples from the spirit fowl farm also left, thanking the crowd profusely in the process. They especially expressed thanks to Bai Xiaochun, who stood there, chest puffed up as he cursed the chicken thief. Then, he organized the chicken thief task force, filling it with other disciples whose cultivation bases did not exceed his.Finally, Bai Xiaochun hurried away, wiping the sweat from his brow. Sighing, he thought,\u201cThat was a close one. I almost lost access to my food source. It\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re so clever and quick-witted, Bai Xiaochun. Heh heh.\u201d Having reached this point in his train of thought, Bai Xiaochun felt very pleased with himself. Humming a little tune, he headed once again in the direction of his courtyard residence. Back in the courtyard, the Spiritwinter Bamboo in the spirit field was growing frighteningly high. It was now three meters high, thicker than his calf, and shocking in appearance.That night, when dark clouds filled the sky and everything was pitch black, Bai Xiaochun sat there with his eyes wide open, licking his lips.\u201cThe night is dark, and I\u2019m feeling hungry yet again\u2026.\u201d\u2014\u2013Note from Deathblade: As luck would have it, just a couple days ago, Er Gen released a new depiction of Zhou Xingqi.

    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 23: The Chicken-Thieving FiendPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23: The Chicken-Thieving FiendIt was late at night, and Fragrant Cloud Peak was blanketed in darkness. If you held your hand out in front of you, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to see your fingers. Other than the whispering wind, everything was peaceful and quiet. Not even a peep could be heard coming from the birds and beasts.Bai Xiaochun hurried through the darkness, Zhou Xinqi\u2019s silk bank tied around his arm, following the path that led to one of the Spirit Tail Chicken farms. As he sped along, he would occasionally duck into a nearby thicket and proceed along in concealment.Soon, the Spirit Tail Chicken farm came into view up ahead. Most of the chickens were asleep, although a few were walking about to and fro. There was even one chicken in particular which was strolling in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction.He crouched there in the thicket, licking his lips until the Spirit Tail Chicken neared the fence. Just as he was pulling out his bamboo cicada, his heart flip-flopped, and a look of vigilance filled his eyes.At the same time, shouting could be heard from behind him as numerous figures charged toward him through the night. They even had flame globes which cast radiant light out into the night.\u201cDamned chicken thief! Finally you show your face!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you here for days! Now we\u2019ve got you surrounded, let\u2019s see how you try to escape!\u201d As the cries echoed out, eight figures closed in on Bai Xiaochun, completely surrounding him.These were the disciples in charge of taking care of the chickens. Even after days of painstakingly laying in wait, they had never imagined that today would be the day when everything paid off. Their hearts were filled with righteous ardor as they prepared to immediately execute justice upon the chicken thief.When their words rang out, Bai Xiaochun looked shocked at first. But then he looked up in thought for a moment and let out a cold snort.\u201cShut up, you people!\u201d he said. \u201cKeep it down!\u201d His words were spoken without the slightest politeness, as if justice were on his side. He did nothing to attempt to flee, but instead, arrogantly rose to his feet, making sure that the silk band on his arm was clearly visible.\u201cSee that?!\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m the captain of the chicken thief task force.\u201d Brow furrowed, he looked around at the eight disciples, clearly displeased.This sudden development caused the eight interlopers to stare in shock. Some of these disciples had seen Bai Xiaochun earlier in the day. After examining him a bit closer, they started to hesitate.One of the disciples seemed a bit skeptical about the situation. \u201cOh, it\u2019s Junior Brother Bai. Well\u2026 what are you doing here so late at night, huh?\u201dHis words caused the other disciples to stare suspiciously at Bai Xiaochun.Flicking his sleeve and frowning, Bai Xiaochun angrily said, \u201cElder Sister Zhou herself asked me to be the captain of the chicken thief task force, so of course I\u2019ll do everything in my power to catch the chicken thief. I\u2019ve even given up my nightly cultivation routine to come here and lay in wait. However, considering how much of a racket you people are making, I\u2019m sure the chicken thief has long since fled.\u201d He really did look like the picture of someone trying to catch a thief.The chicken farm disciples exchanged dismayed glances, and some of them even looked a bit embarrassed. As for the most suspicious of the disciples, his expression softened a bit, although he still didn\u2019t seem totally convinced.Seeing that their suspicions hadn\u2019t been completely dispelled, Bai Xiaochun gave a cold harrumph and, before anyone could ask any more questions, he decided to seize the initiative and put the onus on them.\u201cNo wonder you people have lost so many Spirit Tail Chickens! You\u2019re completely negligent. Look over there, your fence is even broken!\u201d He pointed over to a spot where there really was a hole in the fence, although it wasn\u2019t very obvious. It had actually been punched into the fence by a struggling Spirit Tail Chicken that he had been in the process of stealing a while back.The chicken farm disciples looked in the direction that Bai Xiaochun was pointing, and when they saw the hole, expressions of shock appeared on their faces. It was true that they really hadn\u2019t paid much attention to tiny details like this in the past.\u201cAnd look at that Spirit Tail Chicken. How did you plan to protect it after it walked all the way over here!?\u201d Bai Xiaochun seemed to be getting more and more angry, and was even raising his voice, causing the chicken farm disciples\u2019 faces to flush with shame.\u201cAccording to my investigation, this spot right here is the most remote location on the chicken farm. You should be guarding this place especially closely. But look, I was here for ages before any of you people showed up.\u201d The more Bai Xiaochun talked, the angrier he got. In the end, he let out a long sigh.\u201cHow do you people expect to catch a thief like this, huh? Based on my experience catching thieves, if my speculations are correct, then this is the location in which the most chickens were taken.\u201d As soon as the words left his mouth, the chicken farm disciples began to tremble inwardly. Exchanging glances, they saw the shock in each others\u2019 eyes. Based on the information they had, this was indeed the location where they had lost the most chickens.In fact, that was the reason why they had decided to stand guard here. Bai Xiaochun had hit the nail square on the head, causing the entire group to look at him with increasing admiration.Even the disciple who had been the most suspicious of him now felt that he had been in the wrong. First he thought about how Bai Xiaochun had sacrificed his cultivation time to come catch the thief, and then he remembered how enthusiastic and duty-bound he had seemed earlier in the day. Finally, the disciple took a deep breath, clasped hands and bowed deeply.\u201cJunior Brother Bai, please do not be too deeply offended at what I said earlier. Many thanks for your sacrifice. We will repair this spot immediately, and will definitely increase the guard in this area!\u201dEveryone else clasped hands as well, thinking about how rare it was to find someone as zealous as Bai Xiaochun. He was obviously trying to help them, and that made them even more sorry for their impulsiveness earlier.Bai Xiaochun sighed, then earnestly offered them a few more pieces of advice before turning to leave. As he walked off, the eight disciples once again clasped hands and bowed, completely moved by what he had just done.\u201cJunior Brother Bai is such a good guy.\u201dAs soon as Bai Xiaochun was out of sight, a cold wind brushed against his back, and he realized that he was sweating profusely from how close of a call it had been. However, his stomach was still grumbling, so he decided to go to the other two chicken farms to see if there was still a chance to make a move.He strolled down the mountain path, looking around cautiously as he went along to make sure he wasn\u2019t being followed. His expression was grave as he pondered how to go about stealing a chicken from the next chicken farm. As the wind blew, it fluttered the silk band tied around his arm.Meanwhile, up in dark night air, a woman stood on a blue flying silk, completely undetectable to everyone down below as she examined the situation on this part of Fragrant Cloud Peak. Suddenly, her expression flickered as she caught sight of Bai Xiaochun walking along, looking around vigilantly. Her eyes gradually began to glow with praise.\u201cThis little Junior Brother really takes his responsibilities seriously.\u201d Naturally, that woman was Zhou Xinqi, who had been inspecting the area. Earlier, there had been lots of disciples on patrol, but as the night wore on, most of them had gone back to practice cultivation. Bai Xiaochun was the only one out and about actually trying to catch the thief.\u201cWith him around, the chicken thief will definitely have to reign things in.\u201d Zhou Xinqi looked away and then headed back to her Immortal\u2019s cave, feeling much better about the situation.Two hours later, Bai Xiaochun had circled back around to his courtyard residence. Once inside, he slapped his bag of holding to produce two Spirit Tail Chickens. Chuckling to himself, he plucked them and tossed them into the wok, soon after which, a fragrant aroma filled the air, causing him to salivate. Then, he didn\u2019t even wait for them to cool before wolfing them down ravenously.Finally, he burped, patted his belly, and then laid back, looking so content he almost seemed drunk.Another month passed, during which time Bai Xiaochun conscientiously went out at night, looking very solemn as he appeared randomly to inspect the various chicken farms.Despite that, the chickens still continued to go missing. They seemingly disappeared without a trace, which was a deep mystery. The chicken farm disciples were increasingly feeling as if they had lost all face. Filled with passion, they continuously swore oaths to not give up until the chicken thief was incarcerated.Bai Xiaochun seemed to be taking things even more seriously than them. He was completely devoted to defending the chicken farms, as if he wasn\u2019t even willing to rest until the thief was apprehended. There was even one occasion in which he stood guard at one chicken farm for four days and four nights.The hard work being put in seemed to put a lot of pressure on the chicken thief, and the rate of thievery seemed to have been reduced. However, the thief didn\u2019t disappear altogether. Eventually, nearly half of the Spirit Tail Chickens on Fragrant Cloud Peak were now gone, and the ones left behind were mostly juveniles.In the end, even the chicken farm disciples began berating themselves, and couldn\u2019t help but sigh emotionally. They were of the opinion that if the rest of the chicken thief task force was as conscientious as Junior Brother Bai, then the chicken thief would definitely have been caught already.Zhou Xinqi was getting particularly anxious. One afternoon when Bai Xiaochun was sitting cross-legged at one of the chicken farms, looking around vigilantly, a blue flying silk descended from above, upon which was Zhou Xinqi.After seeing who it was, Bai Xiaochun charmingly called out, \u201cElder Sister Zhou.\u201dWhen Zhou Xinqi\u2019s beautiful eyes fell upon Bai Xiaochun, she smiled and said, \u201cHard at work, I see, Junior Brother Bai.\u201dSoon, other disciples in the area were rushing up, clustering around Zhou Xinqi and also Bai Xiaochun.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I offer my profound thanks for your assistance recently,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI am truly grateful. However, the chicken thief is still as brazen as ever. Therefore, I will join you to stand guard.\u201d After looking around at the group, she frowned slightly and continued, \u201cI\u2019m wondering if perhaps the chicken thief has a connection to my Master. Otherwise, wouldn\u2019t he steal Spirit Tail Chicken from the other mountain peaks too? Instead, he seems to be targeting only my Master\u2019s chickens!\u201dWhen Bai Xiaochun heard that, his eyes began to shine brightly, and he very nearly slapped his thigh. What Zhou Xinqi said made a lot of sense, and as he thought about it, he couldn\u2019t help but look off in the direction of Violet Cauldron Peak. Slowly, his eyes narrowed to cover over the wily glint deep therein.Now that Zhou Xinqi had shown herself, many of her admirers also began to flock to the area. Soon, vast crowds had gathered at Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s Spirit Tail Chicken farms.The chicken thief was now incapable of doing anything, and in the following days, not a single Spirit Tail Chicken was lost.Even still, the mysterious and unfathomable chicken thief was already completely famous. In fact, many people had taken to calling him the Chicken-Thieving Fiend. He had caused such a stir among the disciples that he was considered to stand alongside the owner of the little turtle as one of the most mysterious figures on Fragrant Cloud Peak. In fact, even the Outer Sect disciples on Green Crest Peak and Violet Cauldron Peak had heard about him.Now that the chicken thief had apparently vanished, Zhou Xinqi felt a lot better. Although he had never been apprehended, when she thought about how hard Bai Xiaochun had worked over the past month or more, she ended up rewarding him with the jade pendant anyway, as a form of encouragement.When the matter finally came to an end, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s earnestness and devotion had caused quite a few fellow Outer Sect disciples to notice how pure, charming, and dedicated he was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After activating it with some spiritual energy, the pendant began to glow with a soft, green light that surrounded his body.Next, he performed an incantation gesture with his left hand, causing his wooden sword to appear. It circled around in the air and then shot back toward Bai Xiaochun. However, as soon as it hit the green light, it was as if it had suddenly run into a patch of water, causing it to slow down significantly.\u201cWhat a treasure!\u201d he murmured, putting the wooden sword away and clasping the jade pendant in his hand, feeling a little embarrassed.\u201cAh well, it doesn\u2019t matter. Li Qinghou is Zhou Xinqi\u2019s Master, but he\u2019s my mentor too. In fact, considering our relationship, I should probably call him Uncle.\u201d Clearing his throat, Bai Xiaochun put the jade pendant away, then stood up and stretched lazily.After eating more than half of Li Qinghou\u2019s chickens, his Undying Live Forever Technique was progressing by leaps and bounds. It was now more than seventy percent complete. Of course, the Spirit Tail Chickens replenished his vital energy, not his spiritual energy. However, even though his cultivation base was still at the fourth level of Qi Condensation, it had made some progress, and was more refined than before.He buried all the chicken bones in the spirit soil, which was now filled with so much spiritual energy that it bordered on ridiculous. As for his Spiritwinter Bamboo, it was now more than two meters tall, and no longer purely emerald green; dark dots had begun to appear within the green.Most important of all were the Spirit Tails, which could produce three-colored flames. Bai Xiaochun had been collecting them, and now had several hundred. Whenever he thought about the three-colored flames that the Spirit Tails could produce, his heart filled with anticipation.\u201cI\u2019m in no hurry with my cultivation base. As long as I can get enough medicinal pills, I can do a threefold spirit enhancement on them and advance with flying speed. The most important thing to do is make some progress with my Undying Skin!\u201d Almost as soon as the thought entered his mind, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s stomach started to grumble. At first he looked in the direction of Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s chicken farms, but then he turned toward Violet Cauldron Peak.\u201cEldest Brother is on Violet Cauldron Peak, I wonder how he\u2019s been doing lately.\u201d Thinking about all the things that had happened back in the Ovens, he raced out of his courtyard, down the mountain, and toward Violet Cauldron Peak.Of the three mountains on the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect, Green Crest Peak focused on swords, Fragrant Cloud Peak concentrated on spirit medicine, and Violet Cauldron Peak excelled in magical techniques and spirit enhancement. Furthermore, the south bank\u2019s most fundamental technique, the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art, actually came from Violet Cauldron Peak.Bai Xiaochun walked along the path toward Violet Cauldron Peak, and by the time he got there, evening was falling. He looked up at the mountain, which was wreathed in clouds and mist. High up in the air, he was just barely able to make out tiny shadows flitting around in beams of prismatic light. He sighed.\u201cI wonder when I\u2019ll be able to get some kind of flying treasure, and then do something like that. Then my world will really open up, and I\u2019ll actually be on the path to living forever.\u201d Eyes gleaming with anticipation, he began to ascend Violet Cauldron Peak.Although he wasn\u2019t a disciple of Violet Cauldron Peak, as an Outer Sect disciple, he was qualified to go to any of the various mountains. As he walked along, he asked some people about where Zhang Dahai lived. Thanks to his charming manner, he almost immediately got an answer, and quickly hurried off in the direction indicated.Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s residence was located on a different part of the mountain compared to the location of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s place on Fragrant Cloud Peak. It was on the sunny side of the mountain, where there was stronger spiritual energy. There weren\u2019t many residences here; they were sprinkled about like stars in the night sky, apparently in some prescribed pattern.Although it was evening, and the light wasn\u2019t very clear, it was still possible to see the swirling mists and abundant spirit plants, all of which gave the place a celestial feeling.Taking a deep breath, Bai Xiaochun looked around enviously. \u201cEldest Brother really does have connections in the sect. I can\u2019t believe he got a place like this. It\u2019s way better than mine.\u201dIt only took a bit of looking to find Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s residence. The courtyard was filled with weeds, as if no one had tended to it for ages. Bai Xiaochun gaped in shock, then knocked on the main gate. However, there was no response.\u201cAm I in the wrong place?\u201d he thought. Even as he stood there, shocked, the front door of the building inside the courtyard slowly creaked open, and an emaciated figure appeared, holding a flying sword in his right hand. Dim silver light flickered around his left hand as he trudged out. Looking exhausted, then languidly said, \u201cWho is it?!\u201dEven as the words left the man\u2019s mouth, he suddenly saw Bai Xiaochun standing there across the courtyard, and a tremor ran through him. A look of delight appeared on his face, almost as if he had just caught sight of a blood relative. Suddenly, he flew forward, pushed the main gate open, and then stood there looking at Bai Xiaochun. Then he laughed loudly and said, \u201cNinth Junior Brother!\u201d\u201cWho are you?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun responded, backing up, his eyes wide. Although this person seemed familiar for some reason, Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t identify him at all.He had average features, and was very skinny. Although he couldn\u2019t be described as being only skin and bones, he was almost to that point. His eyes shone with vigor, and yet were sunken in. From the ripples of his cultivation base, he seemed to be in the great circle of the fourth level of Qi Condensation.When the emaciated young man saw Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression, he looked like he was about to start crying.\u201cNinth Fatty, it\u2019s me, Big Fatty!\u201d he said. Face filled with intense grief, he went on to say, \u201cNinth Fatty, you have no idea how much I\u2019ve suffered during the past year. My master is so demanding! As soon as I got here, she told me she doesn\u2019t like fatties, and that I had to go hungry for half a year!\u201cHalf a year, Ninth Fatty! Do you know what I ended up looking like after half a year? It took me forever just to gain this much weight back.\u201d This emaciated young man was none other than Big Fatty Zhang, who was now standing there weeping.Bai Xiaochun looked him over carefully. Having heard the story, and confirmed that he really was his Eldest Brother, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s jaw dropped. The Eldest Brother he remembered, and this person standing in front of him, looked like two completely different people.\u201cIs there some grudge between you and your Master?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked sympathetically.\u201cThat old shrew! I\u2026.\u201d Big Fatty Zhang said a few words, but then shivered and didn\u2019t dare to continue. Pulling Bai Xiaochun into his courtyard, he said, \u201cNinth Junior Brother, I miss the Ovens! Nobody can survive in a place like this. I\u2019ve never been full the entire time I\u2019ve been here, plus there\u2019s no way for me to make any money. Ah, I\u2019m so hungry!\u201d He then proceeded to tell Bai Xiaochun everything that had happened to him from the moment he had arrived.As Bai Xiaochun listened to the bitter tale, he suddenly realized that his decision to start stealing chickens was definitely the right thing to do. He looked at Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s emaciated frame, then sighed and patted his bony shoulder.\u201cSince you\u2019re in some trouble, Elder Brother, then Junior Brother will naturally help. Just wait here for the time it takes an incense stick to burn. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Big Fatty Zhang gaped in shock as Bai Xiaochun turned and left the courtyard.On his way up the mountain, Bai Xiaochun had already taken note of where Violet Cauldron Peak\u2019s Spirit Tail Chicken farms were located. Taking advantage of the darkness of night, he suddenly vanished.Big Fatty Zhang had no idea what was going on, nor any clue as to what Bai Xiaochun might be doing. He waited there at his front gate for the time it takes an incense stick to burn, after which Bai Xiaochun returned, carrying a Spirit Tail Chicken in each hand.When Big Fatty Zhang saw the Spirit Tail Chickens, his eyes went wide. Before he could say anything, though, Bai Xiaochun hustled him into the courtyard. Ignoring Big Fatty Zhang, Bai Xiaochun expertly produced a wok, boiled some water, plucked the chickens and tossed them in. With that, he dusted off his sleeves, lifted his chin and looked at Big Fatty Zhang.Big Fatty Zhang was panting, and his eyes were wide. He pointed at the chickens in the wok, and then back at Bai Xiaochun, and a look of disbelief crept up on his face.\u201cY-you\u2026 don\u2019t tell me that you are the Chicken-Thieving Fiend of Fragrant Cloud Peak!?!?\u201dBai Xiaochun chuckled. Then, as if he were very familiar with the process, placed his hand onto the wok and sent out some spiritual energy to ensure that the chicken meat was perfectly tender. Soon, a fragrant aroma wafted out. Bai Xiaochun reached in, pulled out a chicken leg, and then handed it to Big Fatty Zhang.\u201cEat!\u201d he said, imitating the way Big Fatty Zhang had handed him the magical mushroom back when he had first joined the Ovens.Big Fatty Zhang swallowed a few times as he stared at the chicken leg. Finally, he grabbed it and wolfed it down. From that point on, it wasn\u2019t necessary for Bai Xiaochun to say anything. Big Fatty Zhang flew over to the wok and virtually dunked his face in. The two chickens were rapidly consumed down to the bones, except that he couldn\u2019t stop there; crunching sounds could be heard as he chomped them down too.Finally, he smacked his belly, and laid back, looking nearly drunk with contentment. Then he and Bai Xiaochun exchanged a look and started laughing.\u201cNinth Fatty, you\u2019re incredible,\u201d he said, looking very proud. \u201cYou really were paying attention back in the Ovens. I never would have imagined that Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s illustrious Chicken-Thieving Fiend would turn out to be my bro.\u201d\u201cCultivation is innately a Heaven-defying thing. As cultivators, it\u2019s only natural to contend with the Heavens, and fight with men. You have to rely on yourself! What do a few Spirit Tail Chickens count for?\u201d Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, but was unable to conceal how pleased he was with himself. He had been keeping his identity a secret for far too long now; being able to share it, and then see the look on Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s face, made him feel wonderful.\u201cThe true pity is that I\u2019ve eaten so many Spirit Tail Chickens on Fragrant Cloud Peak that only the chicks are left. They don\u2019t taste very good, otherwise I\u2019d invite you to live with me over there, and we could eat our fill every day. You would definitely gain all your weight back.\u201d Bai Xiaochun sighed.When Big Fatty Zhang heard that, his eyes gleamed, and he immediately crawled to his feet.\u201cViolet Cauldron Peak has them too. The west, south, and north faces of the mountains all do. They\u2019re guarded by two shifts a day, each shift manned by seven disciples!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang went on to explain in further detail. When he was finished, he found Bai Xiaochun looking at him with a strange expression. Big Fatty Zhang cleared his throat and said, \u201cAfter I heard about the Chicken-Thieving Fiend, I decided to try to do the same thing as him. Unfortunately, the chickens are too hard to steal. As soon as you get close, they start making noise. Not only did I not even come close to stealing a chicken, I almost got caught.\u201d Big Fatty Zhang seemed a bit embarrassed about the whole thing.Bai Xiaochun laughed, then edged closer to Big Fatty Zhang and began to whisper something. Gradually, Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s eyes began to glow brighter and brighter, and he was even panting. Then Bai Xiaochun pulled out his bamboo cicada, and after a moment wide smiles covered their faces and they began to chuckle.Soon, laughter rang out from within the courtyard, and it sounded terrifying.From that day on, Bai Xiaochun began to visit Big Fatty Zhang more often, and gradually, the Spirit Tail Chickens from Violet Cauldron Peak began to go missing\u2026.Every night, two great chicken bandits struck. One did the stealing, the other stood watch. Soon, the disciples of Violet Cauldron Peak were in an uproar, and everyone was discussing the matter.\u201cDid you hear? The Chicken-Thieving Fiend from Fragrant Cloud Peak has set his eyes on Violet Cauldron Peak!\u201d\u201cI actually saw it happen! The Chicken-Thieving Fiend isn\u2019t a person, it\u2019s a team of two!\u201dWhen the news got back to Fragrant Cloud Peak, the Outer Sect disciples there all took deep breaths and looked sympathetically in the direction of Violet Cauldron Peak.\u201cSo the Chicken-Thieving Fiend has learned to be balanced. He\u2019s finally not stealing chickens from our Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even the Xu Meixiang, the Peak Lord of Violet Cauldron Peak, who was none other than the old shrew Big Fatty Zhang had mentioned, caught wind of what was happening. Bai Xiaochun and Big Fatty Zhang had no choice but to cease their activities. After discussing the matter together, they decided to go rescue Third Girly Hei.Therefore, the two of them went to Green Crest Peak.Third Girly Hei was a bit thinner, but not conspicuously. However, she now emanated a somewhat seductive air, which left Bai Xiaochun and Big Fatty Zhang virtually speechless. They barely even recognized her. Her previously swarthy face even looked somewhat elegant. One could easily imagine how, if she continued to lose weight, she would eventually turn into a true beauty.However, once she heard about the Spirit Tail Chickens, here eyes began to shine.From then on, the Spirit Tail Chickens on Green Crest Peak began to go missing\u2026.By now, the Chicken-Thieving Fiend was completely famous on the south bank. It was virtually impossible to find an Outer Sect disciple who hadn\u2019t heard of him, and even the servants knew the name.Before long, the Elders took note of the matter. Although the Chicken-Thieving Fiend eventually vanished without a trace, never to reappear again, Third Girly Hei and Big Fatty Zhang both visibly regained a lot of weight. Although they weren\u2019t as impressive as they had been in the past, they were still much sturdier.As for Bai Xiaochun, he finally\u2026 finished eighty-one cycles, at long last sating his hunger. It was at that point that the three of them gave up on stealing chickens.Although the eighty-one cycles of the Undying Live Forever Technique hadn\u2019t been performed in succession, but rather built up over time, the result was absolutely the same.On one particular day, Bai Xiaochun sat in his courtyard in Fragrant Cloud Peak, his expression solemn. His skin was emanating iron-colored pulses, and even glowed with a flickering black light. An incredible aura radiated off of him, making him seem savage and wild.He had endured eighty-one days of pain and then eighty-one days of hunger. That combination transformed into a shocking power that erupted up inside of Bai Xiaochun, over and over again.Each eruption was filled with boundless vital energy, which then poured into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s skin, causing it to become increasingly iron-colored. The black glow grew more blinding, and the toughness of his skin increased exponentially.Eventually, it reached the point that if anyone had happened to catch sight of him standing there, they would think they were looking at an iron statue, and not a flesh and blood human.His mind was reeling as the bursts of energy continued. After the 19th time, he realized that they weren\u2019t slowing down at all, but were actually increasing in intensity.Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t move a muscle, and didn\u2019t even seem to be breathing. However, if you looked closely, you would see that all of the pores on his body were dilated as he silently absorbed the energy of Heaven and Earth in the area.\u201cAfter eighty-one eruptions, my Undying Skin will reach the initial stage of completion, and I\u2019ll be in the Iron Skin stage!\u201d The Undying Live Forever Technique\u2019s mnemonic floated in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind, and a firm and unswerving expression could be seen on his face. All of his hard work over the past year, including enduring all the pain and hunger\u2026 had all been for this moment!RUMBLE!The vital energy inside of him erupted out once more, and the iron color of his skin deepened. Every time the vital energy poured into the flesh of his skin, it was as if it were being tempered by the strikes of thousands of forge hammers.As of this moment, he pulsed with energy, like a divine weapon in the forging process!RUUUUMMMMBLLE!28 times. 30 times. 40 times. 48 times\u2026..Time passed. Three days later, Bai Xiaochun remained in the exact same spot. Although no bystander would be able to hear anything, to him, it sounded like endless thunder was booming in his ears.However, it was at this point that the vital energy inside of him erupted out for the 49th time. Suddenly, the power redoubled, and a tremor ran through him. At the same time, tiny cracks began to appear on his skin, as if it couldn\u2019t endure any longer.Although the cracks were few, as soon as they appeared, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart sank.\u201cSo, the signs of impending death have finally appeared\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun frowned. The introduction to the Undying Live Forever Technique mentioned cracks like this. During the process of reaching the initial stage of success, they were guaranteed to show up. How long each individual could hold on would depend on their willpower, and would end up determining the quality of the future Undying Skin.Even if you didn\u2019t endure for very long at all, you could still successfully cultivate the Undying Skin. However, the quality would naturally fall short of perfect.If you could hold on through all 81 eruptions of vital energy, then you could reach a state of perfect flawlessness.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes gleamed with determination for a moment before he closed them once more. Rumbling explosions continued to erupt inside of him. 50 times. 60 times. 70 times\u2026. Unexpectedly, one breath took him through five whole days, during which he endured all the way past 70.The cracks covering him were so numerous that his skin almost looked like a turtle\u2019s. In many places, the cracks had joined together, making him resemble a broken flower vase that had been pieced back together.He looked like he might shatter at any moment.\u201cOnly seven more times!\u201d he thought, his eyes completely bloodshot. Panting, he clenched his jaw, and that vicious streak in his personality surged to life.74 times!77 times!79 times!Bai Xiaochun threw his head back and roared, although it wasn\u2019t very loud of a roar, more like a muffled grunt. His body trembled as he endured yet another eruption, reaching a total of 80.The vital energy poured into his skin which, although it was covered with cracks, was like iron; anyone who saw it would surely be shocked.\u201cLast one!\u201d he said. As the final burst of vital energy surged out, he suddenly extended his right hand and smashed it down toward the ground.A boom rang out, and a huge crater appeared. The final blast of vital energy erupted as everything reached a conclusion. Endless amounts of vital energy poured into his skin, causing the cracks to immediately vanish, leaving him looking sleek and smooth. The black glow vanished, and he looked just as fair and pure as before. However, now his skin was far tougher than ordinary skin, although nobody could tell that by looking at him.Bai Xiaochun stood there panting for a moment before looking up at the crater he had just blasted into the ground. Then he looked at his skin, and his expression brightened. Finally, he threw his head back and laughed uproariously.He waved his right hand, causing his wooden sword to fly out, which then transformed into a black beam that slashed at his forearm. As soon as it hit, a metallic clang rang out, and the wooden sword unexpectedly flew backward. As for his arm, it felt almost like a mosquito had bitten him. When he examined the point of impact, his skin wasn\u2019t harmed at all.\u201cUndying Skin!\u201d he cried, unable to contain his joy. It must be stated that his wooden sword was no ordinary magical item; it had received a twofold spirit enhancement. Although it was made from ordinary materials, because of the spirit enhancement, it could be considered a magical item worthy of a Chosen. Despite that, though, it hadn\u2019t hurt him at all.Bai Xiaochun suddenly flickered into motion, shooting forward. A buzzing sound could be heard as he suddenly appeared more than thirty meters away. He could now move many times faster than before, leaving him completely delighted.As for the power he could unleash, a mere look at the crater in the ground revealed that it was also many times greater than before. Furthermore, this was only the initial stage of success of the Undying Skin. Although it couldn\u2019t be said that he had completely cast off his mortal body, he was definitely vastly different than before.\u201cWith defensive power like this,\u201d he thought, Bai Xiaochun is going to be much safer on his path to living forever.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was extremely pleased with himself. Next, he examined his cultivation base and saw that he had also made quite a bit of progress in that aspect as well. He was now in the great circle of the fourth level of Qi Condensation.Furthermore, it was not the ordinary great circle. Because of how the spiritual energy had been compressed inside of him, it\u2019s quality was far beyond compare to an ordinary cultivator of the same stage as himself.Feeling very satisfied, he sped a few laps around the courtyard, then suddenly stopped, eyes gleaming. Lifting his right hand out in front of him, he held his thumb and forefinger out in a U shape. Then he pinched them together, causing a black glow to appear on them. Although nothing happened, cracking sounds could be heard in the air up ahead of him.Eyes widening, he turned and dashed over to a nearby rock, where he once again caused the black light to flash from his two fingers. As soon as he pinched the fingers together, cracking sounds could be heard as the rock exploded like a piece of tofu.He flickered into motion again, appeared next to the Spiritwinter Bamboo, which was now more than nine meters tall. After identifying the toughest of the bamboo stalks, he pinched his fingers together. A boom could be heard as the bamboo shattered.Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and sank down to the ground, where he looked down at his two fingers, and the black glow which was slowly fading away from them. After a bit of time passed, he let out a long breath.\u201cSo, that\u2019s the Throat Crushing Grasp, huh\u2026?\u201d he murmured quietly. That was one of the secret magics of the Undying Live Forever Technique, something that could only be unleashed after reaching the first stage of initial success. Supposedly, it could double one\u2019s power, and could not be countered.Just now, Bai Xiaochun had only used about fifty percent of his full power. He couldn\u2019t even imagine how powerful and terrifying the secret magic would be if he unleashed its full power.From what Bai Xiaochun could tell, a secret magic like that should be used for killing people. After a moment of silent thought, he came to the conclusion that although it was brutal, he still needed to practice it in earnest. Therefore, he began to zip back and forth in his courtyard, causing a black flashing light and cracking sounds to echo out.Time passed. In the blink of an eye, half a month went by. During that time, Bai Xiaochun never left his courtyard. He stayed there practicing the entire time. Naturally, he had no way of knowing that after months of being away, Li Qinghou had finally returned to the Spirit Stream Sect, and was currently flying through the air atop a beam of green light, heading directly toward Fragrant Cloud Peak.After he landed, and before he could even rest, two beams of light shot out from Green Crest Peak and Violet Cauldron Peak and headed in his direction. Soon, he could make out the figure of an old man in one of the beams of light. He looked like a sharp, unsheathed sword, and emanated the unique pressure of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.In the other beam of light was graceful woman. She looked like a natural beauty, exquisite despite the strange expression on her face. It almost looked like she didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. Together with the old man, she alighted on the mountain peak.These two were the Peak Lords of Green Crest Peak and Violet Cauldron Peak respectively. After arriving at Fragrant Cloud Peak, they had a private discussion with Li Qinghou, then left.Li Qinghou stood atop Fragrant Cloud Peak, rubbing the bridge of his nose. Finally, he sent out some divine sense, focusing it on the three Spirit Tail Chicken farms in their various locations on the mountain. When he saw that the only things left were chicks, he similarly looked like he didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. Sighing, he waved his sleeve and began to walk down the mountain. From the direction he took\u2026It seemed he was heading directly toward Bai Xiaochun\u2019s courtyard residence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, it was in a somewhat remote part of the mountain. As he proceeded along, the courtyard residence soon became visible off in the distance.However, before he could get very close, a fair, clear-faced figure appeared, holding a piece of roasted meat in his hand, walking and eating at the same time. He seemed to be engrossed in his eating, and was even humming a little tune.Li Qinghou\u2019s face darkened as he realized that the meat currently being stuffed into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth was definitely a chicken leg. Anger instantly flared up in his heart.\u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201d he roared, his voice booming out like thunder. Bai Xiaochun, who was in the middle of sucking on the chicken bone, very nearly jumped up into the air in fright.\u201cPeak Lord Li!\u201d he gasped, his eyes widening. Without even thinking about it, he stuffed the entire chicken bone into his mouth, then vigorously crunched it to pieces and swallowed it down, his face turning a deep purple in the process.In the entire sect, the person he feared the most was Li Qinghou, which was especially true after having eaten so many of his chickens. Bai Xiaochun actually felt a little bit guilty. Wiping the sweat from his brow, he hurried over, looking extremely charming and also very sincere as he clasped hands and bowed in greeting.\u201cDisciple offers greetings, Peak Lord.\u201dLi Qinghou looked at Bai Xiaochun, his face completely expressionless. Inwardly, he felt a bit torn. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s ancestor had truly shown him a great kindness, and Li Qinghou was the type of person who valued such things deeply. Despite what Bai Xiaochun had obviously done, he couldn\u2019t forget about what had happened all those years ago.The Peak Lords from Green Crest Peak and Violet Cauldron Peak had come to speak with him about the matter of the Spirit Tail Chickens. Although the chickens weren\u2019t necessarily very expensive, Li Qinghou couldn\u2019t allow other people to criticize his own disciple, so he compensated them with several times more than the chickens\u2019 actual value.Now, he looked at Bai Xiaochun, feeling even more irritated than ever at how he wasn\u2019t living up to expectations.Li Qinghou snorted and then said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been an Outer Sect disciple for a little more than half a year, but your cultivation base has only progressed from the third level of Qi Condensation to the fourth. Pleased with yourself?\u201dBai Xiaochun blinked, then cleared his throat, unsure of how to respond. However, he continued to put on the charming face, reassuring himself that as long as he maintained the right attitude, things should work out fine in the end. However, when he thought about the fact that he had just been munching on a Spirit Tail Chicken leg, he couldn\u2019t help but sweat.Li Qinghou felt a headache coming on. After a moment of thought, he coolly continued, \u201cConsidering how you\u2019ve been fooling around, you obviously have a lot of time on your hands. In that case, why don\u2019t you join the competition for fourth and fifth level Qi Condensation disciples in three months? It will be right here on Fragrant Cloud Peak.\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s heart immediately began to pound. He had heard about the competition Li Qinghou was referring to. He knew that there were prizes to be won, but he had also heard that the fighting was fierce. If you weren\u2019t careful, it was even possible to get injured. Bai Xiaochun scowled.\u201cPeak Lord, I\u2019m only at the fourth level of Qi Condensation. If I join in the competition, what happens if one of them ends up beating me to death? What would I do then\u2026?\u201dLi Qinghou completely ignored his question. Looking very serious, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a request. You will join the contest. Plus, if you don\u2019t place in the top 5, then I\u2019ll\u2026.\u201dBai Xiaochun sighed. \u201cI know, you\u2019ll expel me from the sect, right\u2026?\u201dLi Qinghou glared at him. Knowing how mischievous Bai Xiaochun was, he realized that the threat of being expelled from the sect probably wasn\u2019t enough to keep him in place. Remembering how much Bai Xiaochun feared death, he suddenly swished his sleeve, sweeping Bai Xiaochun up from the courtyard and then flying toward the top of the mountain.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart began to thump madly. Li Qinghou\u2019s expressionless face gave him a very bad feeling. The wind buffeted his face as they flew along, and before he had time to even analyze the matter, Li Qinghou had taken him to a location behind Fragrant Cloud Peak.It was a place considered to be a restricted area, a place few disciples ever visited. The first thing he noticed was the thick vegetation everywhere.As they flew down toward the area, Li Qinghou pulled Bai Xiaochun along until they were in a valley. Almost immediately, a sinister aura could be sensed, and the various plants in the area brightened in color, and even began to rustle.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart raced as he looked at the plants, and a sensation of deadly crisis rose up in his heart. He was just about to speak when, all of a sudden, a crimson viper raised its head, flicking its forked tongue as it stared icily at Bai Xiaochun.\u201cSnake!\u201d Bai Xiaochun had no choice but to follow Li Qinghou into the valley, and when he did, his scalp went numb as he realized that the ground, the plants, and even the trees in this place were filled with countless snakes.All of them were brightly colored, making it obvious that they were vipers. Furthermore, all of them were staring at him with cold, beady eyes, forked tongues flicking in and out of their mouths.Bai Xiaochun started trembling. He had always been scared of snakes, and the way these ones were looking at him left him terrified. Although they didn\u2019t actually seem like they were going to attack him, their long fangs dripped with venom in a very frightening fashion.It was at this point that Bai Xiaochun suddenly remembered that he had his Undying Skin, and that these vipers probably wouldn\u2019t be able to bite through it. Considering that, even if there were more snakes than there already were, to him they were about as dangerous as feeble chickens. In the end, they weren\u2019t really very scary at all.However, his eyes then turned up in thought, and he realized how risky it would be to not look scared. If that happened, Li Qinghou might take him to an even more dangerous place. Therefore, he immediately let out a shriek, and tried to look as frightened as possible.Li Qinghou let out a cold snort, then unleashed his cultivation base. The wriggling snakes slowly moved out of the way to make a small path, at the end of which was a pitch-black cave that emanated a noxious odor.\u201cUncle Li, s-spare me, please!\u201d Bai Xiaochun called out in a quavering voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t break any sect rules!\u201d Li Qinghou\u2019s face was completely expressionless as he grabbed Bai Xiaochun and dragged him over to the cave. Once they reached the cave mouth, he waved his sleeve, causing the darkness to fill with a bit of light.Bai Xiaochun could instantly see that the cave was filled with numerous vipers, some of them very large. The hissing sounds they made seemed to contain some strange, mesmerizing power that instantly caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes to go wide.A sensation of crisis rose up, and he began to pant as he realized that the cultivation base power of these vipers was unexpectedly high. There was even one four-colored viper that was comparable to the fifth level of Qi Condensation.The stares of the snakes made Bai Xiaochun feel as if a cold wind were blowing down his back. Then he thought about his Undying Skin and realized that he wouldn\u2019t last for very long against these snakes. This time, he didn\u2019t need to pretend, he really was scared.\u201cThis is 10,000 Snakes Valley,\u201d Li Qinghou said, voice cool, \u201cwhere we harvest venom here on Fragrant Cloud Peak. Each one of these snakes is extremely venomous. In fact, a single drop of their venom is potent enough to kill a hundred oxen.\u201cAny cultivator under Foundation Establishment bitten by one of these snakes, who doesn\u2019t get the antidote in time, will die. Deep in the cave is the Snake King, who is in the great circle of Qi Condensation. Get bitten by that snake, and even I would have a hard time saving you.\u201cIf you don\u2019t get in the top 5 in the Outer Sect\u2019s competition, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t expel you from the sect. I\u2019ll just bring you here and have you harvest venom.\u201d Li Qinghou looked over at Bai Xiaochun.\u201cUm\u2026 uh\u2026 Uncle Li, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just a little sect competition, right? Only the top 5, you said, right? I\u2019ll definitely pull it off!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s tongue felt as if it were sticking to the roof of his mouth, and his face was deathly pale. When he heard that there were even more fearsome vipers in the depths of the cave, he swore to himself that he would never come back to this place again in his entire life.When Li Qinghou heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s declaration, he smiled inwardly. However, his face remained completely expressionless, and he even snorted as he took Bai Xiaochun away. When they got back to Fragrant Cloud Peak, he tossed Bai Xiaochun onto a mountain path and then turned as if to leave.But then he stopped and looked back. Voice casual, he said, \u201cOh right, how were the Spirit Tail Chickens?\u201dWithout even waiting for Bai Xiaochun to respond, he turned and flew off into the distance.Bai Xiaochun sighed, then turned and headed back toward his courtyard, frowning the entire way. As he walked along, the wind blew, rustling the leaves, which made him think about the vipers.Back in his courtyard, he sat there, gnashing his teeth and scowling. \u201cLi Qinghou\u2026. More like Li the Snake! Ridiculous!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll definitely never go back to that 10,000 Snakes Valley. If I get bitten, I\u2019ll lose my poor little life.\u201d In that moment, Bai Xiaochun made his decision. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to go all out to get into the top 5!\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m going to join that competition, then considering the level of my cultivation base, I\u2019m definitely going to need some spirit medicine!\u201d Taking a deep breath, Bai Xiaochun clenched his fists. A wild gleam appeared in his eyes as he glanced around. Eventually, his gaze fell upon the Spiritwinter Bamboo.\u201cAfter I finish the Spiritwinter Bamboo mission and get my reward, I\u2019ll have enough merit points to get some spirit medicine. Unfortunately, the bamboo hasn\u2019t even reached fifteen meters. I\u2019m not sure if that meets the requirements\u2026.\u201d Having reached this point in his train of thoughts, Bai Xiaochun still wasn\u2019t certain about the bamboo. However, he didn\u2019t have any other options. After doing a few calculations, he confirmed that the appointed deadline to hand in the spirit vegetation was rapidly approaching.Bai Xiaochun scowled his way through a few more days. At dawn on the fourth day, he got up early and walked over to the bamboo. Then he wrapped his arms around one stalk after another to pull them up out of the ground.What he found was that although the bamboo did not seem to be very heavy, each and every stalk actually felt as if it were made from metal, and was incredibly heavy.The ground trembled constantly until ten stalks of bamboo were uprooted. Each one was close to fifteen meters tall, and as thick as a person. Throwing them over his shoulder, he marched out of the courtyard in the direction of the Missions Office.Unfortunately, his bag of holding wasn\u2019t very big inside, and the bamboo just wouldn\u2019t fit in it. That was why he had to physically carry the bamboo. Thankfully, he was much stronger now, having achieved the Undying Iron Skin. Otherwise, he would never have been able to pull the task off.As he walked along, he muttered to himself miserably. But then he thought about the competition, and the vipers, and possibility of his bones and tendons being snapped in the fighting.\u201cWhy am I so unlucky\u2026?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 27: Th-that's... Bamboo?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe bamboo was extremely heavy, and he was carrying ten stalks. Couple that with the fact that he was climbing a mountain, and soon Bai Xiaochun was huffing and puffing. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that he was in a really unfair situation.\u201cI began to practice immortal cultivation because I want to live forever. Why the heck would I go around fighting and killing, huh?\u201cThis bamboo could obviously grow a bit taller, but right now I need those merit points....\u201d The more he thought about the situation, the more annoyed he got at the unfairness of it all. Sighing, he hefted his spiritwinter bamboo as he hiked up the mountain path.Currently, quite a large group of Outer Sect disciples was gathered outside of Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s Missions Office, hands filled with various medicinal plants which they would exchange for merit points.A Fragrant Cloud Peak Elder was present to inspect the items being handed in. The amount of merit points given as a reward depended on the quality of the items handed in.Just outside of the building itself was a wide, flat boulder, upon which a ruddy-faced, white-haired old man sat cross-legged. A seemingly endless line of disciples stretched out in front of him, and everyone in line had spirit plants clutched in hand. When the old man gave his appraisal, a young assistant off to the side would record the information and dole out the merit points.\u201cNot bad. This watermist orchid already has four petals. Mid-grade item.\u201cThis woodvein ginseng is a bit too dark, and the earth-type power is too strong. It\u2019s completely out of balance. Sorry, it doesn\u2019t meet the requirements.\u201dCircling about overhead was a flock of elegant five-colored phoenixes, each one more than three meters long. Occasionally, they would make melodious calls that rang out in the area.They were spirit pets belonging to the elder who sat there, and whenever the appointed day came to hand in plants and vegetation, the birds would come along with him. They were, of course, the subject of much envy on the part of the Outer Sect disciples.The elder\u2019s cultivation base was in the Foundation Establishment stage, and was clearly beyond ordinary. Although his overall skill with spirit medicines didn\u2019t match up to Li Qinghou\u2019s, he was still very famous in the sect. Furthermore, his obsession with the Dao of medicines had reached a frightening level that even Li Qinghou couldn't equal. Many people even said that if a third master apothecary ever appeared in the Eastwood Continent, then it would definitely be this very Elder Zhou.There was one particular young man in the line who wasn't very handsome, but stood tall and straight. When he reached Elder Zhou, he clasped hands and bowed respectfully. \u201cGreetings, Elder Zhou, it\u2019s me, Chen Zi\u2019ang.\u201dWhen the other Outer Sect disciples in the area heard the young man's name, they all looked over curiously.\u201cOh, so he\u2019s Elder Brother Chen Zi\u2019ang. I heard that he's quite gifted when it comes to growing spirit plants.\u201d\u201cI heard that too. Ever since Chen Zi\u2019ang joined the sect, he\u2019s never grown a spirit plant that got less than a high-grade rating. He\u2019s really incredible!\u201dAs the discussions continued in low tones, Chen Zi\u2019ang stood there with a tranquil, indifferent expression on his face. However, deep in his eyes burned a proud and lofty air.Elder Zhou could see how pleased Chen Zi\u2019ang was. He had long since been keeping an eye on him, considering how gifted he was when it came to growing spirit plants.\u201cZi\u2019ang, what type of plant did you grow this time?\u201d Elder Zhou asked warmly.\u201cElder Zhou, I'm happy to report that I grew spiritwinter bamboo!\u201d With that, Chen Zi\u2019ang waved his hand, causing ten stalks of spiritwinter bamboo to appear. Each one was as thick as an arm, and over two meters long. They were emerald green, and even flickered with a faint green glow.\u201cI first soaked the seeds in a spirit spring, then ground some spirit stones into gravel to act as soil. Next, I fed the plants with my own spiritual energy at least every six hours. Every three days, I would carefully tend to their leaves, and I even used the Ninegreens Profound Magic I mastered, as well as other medicinal plants, to grow them to this level!\u201d\u201cVery good,\u201d said Elder Zhou, stroking his beard. The praise in his eyes was clear. \u201cThese stalks of bamboo are over two meters long, and pulse with green energy. They exceed the high-grade mark, and can be classified as extreme high-grade. I encourage you to keep working hard. If you can grow the bamboo to over three meters, then they will be classified as superior-grade.\u201dWhen the surrounding Outer Sect disciple heard the words extreme high-grade, even more discussions broke out, and numerous envious gazes were cast in the direction of the spiritwinter bamboo.A smile broke out on Chen Zi\u2019ang\u2019s face, and the lofty gleam in his eyes intensified. He clasped hands and bowed, and was just about to walk over to the assistant to collect his merit points, when a cold snort suddenly rang out.\u201cElder Zhou, Disciple Zhao Yiduo also grew some spiritwinter bamboo!\u201d A long-faced young man with narrow eyes suddenly appeared. As he approached, he cast a glance of disdain in Chen Zi\u2019ang\u2019s direction. [1. Zhao Yiduo\u2019s name in Chinese is \u8d75\u4e00\u591a zh\u00e0o y\u012b du\u014d. Zhao is a common surname. Yi means \u201cone\u201d and duo means \u201cmore\u201d]His sudden appearance on the scene instantly caused excitement among the surrounding Outer Sect disciples, who all looked over at him.\u201cIt\u2019s Elder Brother Zhao Yiduo! Elder Brother Zhao\u2019s skill with spirit plants and vegetation is supposedly neck and neck with Chen Zi\u2019ang\u2019s!\u201d\u201cWell now we get to see them face off. They\u2019ve been rivals for some time now, and both of them want to be known as the number one botanist among all the disciples.\u201dChen Zi\u2019ang\u2019s expression immediately darkened. He looked coldly at Zhao Yiduo, who glared back at him. The hostility in their eyes instantly intensified.\u201cZhao Yiduo, go ahead and take out your spiritwinter bamboo,\u201d Elder Zhou said encouragingly. Apparently, even he was interested in finding out what was going to happen. He was well aware of the competition between the two young disciples, and was in fact happy to see it. It was only by means of healthy competition that great advancement could be made.Zhao Yiduo clasped hands and bowed to Elder Zhou, then slapped his bag of holding to produce ten stalks of spiritwinter bamboo, each and every one of which was over three meters long and thicker than a person\u2019s leg. They were bright emerald green and even seemed somewhat crystalline. From the spiritual energy they emanated, it was clear that they were beyond normal, and also far above Chen Zi\u2019ang\u2019s in terms of quality.The mere sight of the bamboo sent the crowd into an uproar. Most people had heard that spiritwinter bamboo could grow longer than three meters, but had never seen it before.Spiritwinter bamboo three meters long! I wonder how long it took to grow?\u201d\u201cThat spiritwinter bamboo has reached the point where it\u2019s emanating spiritual energy. Elder Brother Zhao\u2019s ability with plants definitely puts him as the number one Outer Sect disciple on Fragrant Cloud Peak!\u201dSeeing how excited the crowd was, Zhao Yiduo smiled provokingly at Chen Zi\u2019ang.Chen Zi\u2019ang\u2019s face immediately darkened.As for Elder Zhou, his eyes gleamed with praise as he looked at the bamboo and then nodded.\u201cExcellent, excellent. Quite a few disciples have handed in spiritwinter bamboo today, but yours is definitely the best in terms of quality. It isn\u2019t high-grade, it's definitely superior-grade. Very, very good job, Zhao Yiduo. Keep up the good work!\u201dZhao Yiduo once again bowed to Elder Zhou, then looked over challengingly at Chen Zi\u2019ang. \u201cJunior Brother Chen, it seems you need to put some more work into your studies.\u201dChen Zi\u2019ang\u2019s expression grew even darker, and he snorted coldly. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a bit early to gloat, Elder Brother Zhao? After all, it doesn\u2019t count when you have someone helping you. Next time, I\u2019ll definitely grow the spiritwinter bamboo to five meters tall!\u201dHearing this, Zhao Yiduo laughed heartily. \u201cJunior Brother Chen, if you talk yourself up too much, you\u2019re bound to crash and burn. spiritwinter bamboo is extremely hard to grow because of the incredible amount of spiritual energy it requires. For Qi Condensation disciples like us, growing it to three meters is the absolute limit of the limit. And you think you\u2019re going to grow it to five meters? Only Foundation Establishment Elders could do something like that. That\u2019s not even to mention six meters. In all the years I\u2019ve been in the sect, I've never even seen six-meter-tall Spiritwin--\u201dBefore Zhao Yiduo could even finish speaking, booming thuds could be heard from the path leading up to the Missions Office, as if some enormous creature were approaching. Instantly, the Outer Sect disciples turned in shock, whereupon gasps began to ring out.The standoff between Zhao Yiduo and Chen Zi\u2019ang was also interrupted, and both of them frowned and looked over toward the path.Soon, what became visible were the tops of several stalks of enormous bamboo, thicker than a person. They were a bright emerald green, and if you looked closely, you would even see some violet specks flickering on their surface. They also emanated a splendid, multicolored glow.Even more shocking was the powerful spiritual energy emanating off of the bamboo, which instantly led to cries of shock.\u201cWh-what is that stuff!?\u201d\u201cIt looks like some kind of tree! But at the same time, it also looks like bamboo!\u201dChen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo were frowning, and couldn't even identify what it was they were looking at. However, they could tell that it was something incredible. Off to the side, Elder Zhou\u2019s eyes were wide as he stared at the bamboo, and he even began to pant slightly.Everyone stared as more and more of the bamboo became visible. When the bamboo was completely revealed, shockingly, each stalk was fifteen meters tall, and it was being carried by a petite young man, who was currently panting as he trudged up the path, the bamboo slung over his shoulder.He almost looked like an ant carrying a steamed ....Every step that he took resulted in a booming thud, and as he walked along, the Outer Sect disciples made way for him, shocked by how strong he appeared to be.The young man was, of course, Bai Xiaochun, who had been grumbling to himself the entire way about the brutality of the competition and the horror of 10,000 Snakes Valley. Although he wanted to cry, no tears would come, and as he trudged along, he didn\u2019t even notice the crowd of people looking at him. When he reached Elder Zhou, he tossed the bamboo down onto the ground, which resulted in a huge boom. Then he sat down on top of the bamboo, huffing and puffing a bit as he wiped the sweat from his brow.\u201cI couldn't fit this bamboo in my bag of holding. Man, I'm totally worn out. Oh, hello Elder, I\u2019m here to hand in this mission.\u201d All of a sudden, Bai Xiaochun got an odd feeling, and looked around to find everyone in the crowd staring at his bamboo. Gasps could even be heard.\u201cBamboo.... That stuff is actually bamboo?\u201d\u201cIt's so big! I\u2019ve never seen bamboo that big before. Come on, they must be trees, right?!\u201dChen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo couldn\u2019t conceal their astonishment as they realized what they were looking at. However, they almost couldn't make themselves believe it was true, and knelt down to inspect the bamboo more closely. Zhao Yiduo began to tremble, and had to resist the urge to try and break open one of the bamboo stalks to examine it from the inside.Before he could, Elder Zhou tromped over and then waved his sleeve, sending Chen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo tumbling off to the side. Then Elder Zhou stood there, staring at the bamboo with wide eyes. After a long moment, he took a deep breath and said, \u201cTh-this... this really is spiritwinter bamboo!!\u201dThe surrounding Outer Sect disciples gaped in shock for a moment, and then burst into an uproar.\"Spiritwinter bamboo!! I can't believe those big trees... are actually spiritwinter bamboo!!\u201d\u201cHow is that even possible? How could spiritwinter bamboo get so thick? Heavens, they\u2019re actually fifteen meters long!\u201d\u201cFifteen meters and as thick as a person. Th-that\u2019s... bamboo?\u201dThe sounds of the uproar grew even louder as people began to compare Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bamboo with that of Chen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo, apparently completely oblivious to the pain caused by Elder Zhou tossing them aside, rushed back toward the bamboo and knelt down to examine it.Elder Zhou began to study the stalks of bamboo one by one, his expression that of shock and elation.Everyone\u2019s crazed reaction left Bai Xiaochun somewhat alarmed. In his mind, these people were acting like lunatics. It was just bamboo, after all, right? Besides, he had originally planned to grow it to a total of thirty meters before turning it in.Bai Xiaochun took a few steps back and then tried to get the Elder\u2019s attention.\u201cElder\u2026.\u201d he cried loudly.\u201cWonderful! Amazing!\u201d Elder Zhou said, laughing as he began to caress each and every inch of the bamboo. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t even heard Bai Xiaochun speaking. \u201cSpiritwinter Bamboo like this is extremely rare. Only by growing it to fifteen meters can it achieve such a deep green color. In fact, at this point, it\u2019s not a medicinal plant, but rather, the primary ingredient to forge spirit bamboo swords. It can even be used to cast certain unique magical techniques!\u201cListen up everyone. Take a deep breath.\u201d Looking very excited, Elder Zhou closed his eyes and breathed in deeply through his nose. \u201cCan you smell that fragrance? It smells like flesh and bone, right? That\u2019s the unique aroma that appears after this type of bamboo reaches fifteen meters!\u201dChen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo earnestly followed suit. The other disciples in the area also pressed forward to do the same.Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat. He had noticed that same aroma as he was carrying the bamboo down the path. However, he was pretty sure that\u2026 it was actually the aroma of chicken bones. After all, he had buried several hundred Spirit Tail Chicken skeletons in the spirit field where he had grown the Spiritwinter Bamboo. Furthermore\u2026 those bones had all been stripped clean of their meat by none other than him.By now, Bai Xiaochun was thoroughly convinced that these people were crazy.\u201cElder\u2026.\u201d he cried out again.However, it was at this point that a violent tremor ran through Elder Zhou; flames of rage sprang up in his eyes, and his expression twisted with rage.\u201cDammit! What the hell happened here? Someone actually bit a chunk out? Spiritwinter Bamboo is extremely bitter and can\u2019t be eaten raw! What bastard actually bit a chunk out and ruined the quality!?\u201d Elder Zhou seemed begrieved; to him, it was like discovering a perfect piece of beautiful jade, only to find one part that had been destroyed by pests. His head suddenly whipped up to look at Bai Xiaochun.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me!\u201d Bai Xiaochun blurted, backing up nervously. He suddenly thought back to the first time he had been struck by incredible hunger. In his desperation at not having anything to eat, he had taken a bite out of one of the stalks of bamboo. How could he ever have imagined this would be the terrifying scene that would result when he went to hand in the mission, or how that single bite would affect these lunatics?When the surrounding disciples heard what Elder Zhou said, they peered over toward the last of the Spiritwinter Bamboo stalks, and sure enough, there was a big bite mark clearly visible.Elder Zhou stared at the damaged portion of the bamboo, then let out a long sigh. After all, he was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and was obsessed with the Dao of medicines. However, this bamboo that Bai Xiaochun had brought was so shocking, and so different from anything Elder Zhou had ever seen before, that he had lost his composure just now.Finally, he took a deep look at Bai Xiaochun, then flicked his sleeve.\u201cThis bamboo is extreme super-grade\u2026 no, wait, supreme-grade. Yes, list it as supreme-grade. The reward is 10,000 merit points!\u201d The audience gasped in response. The usual reward for plant-growing missions was usually about 10 merit points. At the most, one might be able to get 100. But in this case, the reward was 10,000!Off to the side, the assistant gaped in shock. For years and years, it had always been a rarity to have a spirit plant listed as supreme-grade.In fact, this was the first one in hundreds of years.Bai Xiaochun was very excited, and immediately walked over to the assistant and handed over his identity medallion. The assistant hesitated for a moment, then looked over at Elder Zhou, who was still studying the bamboo, then gritted his teeth and gave the merit points to Bai Xiaochun.Having acquired his merit points, Bai Xiaochun quickly turned to leave, determined to never come back and deal with these lunatics ever again.However, before he could leave, Elder Zhou suddenly called out. \u201cHey, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cBai Xiaochun,\u201d was the immediate response. \u201cI\u2019m Bai Xiaochun, and my uncle is Li Qinghou!\u201d Before coming here, he had been completely unaware that the bamboo would cause such a scene, and he was actually a bit worried about that, which was why he pulled out Li Qinghou\u2019s name, as sort of a threat.\u201cHmph.\u201d Elder Zhou seemed to be irritated that Bai Xiaochun would resort to dropping Li Qinghou\u2019s name. \u201cYou might think you\u2019re pretty clever, but the Spirit Stream Sect is one of the great sects, with a long history. There are always disciples who come along with their secrets and their unique good fortune. I won\u2019t lower myself to the level of asking for the specifics of how you grew this bamboo, but next time you grow something similar, you make sure to bring it all to me. I\u2019ll make sure you get a nice reward of merit points!\u201d Finally, he waved his hand to dismiss Bai Xiaochun, then went back to studying the bamboo. It was at this point that, because of the matter with the bamboo, the entire mission-handover event concluded.Bai Xiaochun clutched his command medallion firmly in hand as he hurried away from the Missions Office and then headed directly toward Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s Spirit Medicine Pharmacy, which was where disciples could acquire spirit medicines.It was also where disciples could hand over spirit medicines that they had crafted, and thus earn merit points.Bai Xiaochun sped over at top speed, then hurried around the Spirit Medicine Pharmacy trying to decide what to buy. Eventually he decided to purchase a bottle of medicinal pills suitable for the fifth level of Qi Condensation. These medicinal pills were by no means cheap. Bai Xiaochun had originally assumed that 10,000 merit points was a lot, but unexpectedly, the spirit medicines were actually very expensive.\u201cGreengod Spiritgathering Pills,\u201d he murmured, looking at the medicinal pill bottle he held in his hand. Inside were three medicinal pills, which had cost him fully 4,000 merit points.However, these were pills that ordinary Qi Condensation disciples would usually not have access to. They were quite extraordinary; not only was their medicinal efficacy greater than that of ordinary spirit medicine, they could provide purer spiritual energy.Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t convinced that merely stepping into the fifth level of Qi Condensation would be enough, so he planned to break through all the way to the great circle of the fifth level.He had thought about aiming for the sixth level of Qi Condensation to avoid having to fight in the competition, but if he did that, he could well imagine how Li Qinghou would come up with some other method of punishing him.As for the rest of his merit points, he didn\u2019t let them go to waste. He traded them for some disposable defensive talismans. With those hidden in his robe, he felt much safer.Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have enough merit points to go through with his plan of heading to the Treasure Pavilion to acquire a weapon or two suitable for the Qi Condensation stage. Instead, he headed back toward his residence. Once back in the courtyard, he sat down cross-legged in his log cabin, then pulled the medicinal pills out and studied them closely.\u201cI still have three months to go. It\u2019s time for some secluded meditation!\u201d Gritting his teeth, he looked around to make sure no one was watching, then performed an incantation gesture and pointed out. Instantly, the turtle-wok flew out, along with a bunch of Spirit Tails, which he used to start a three-colored flame.One tail feather wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy the turtle-wok. He had to feed in ten before the three designs on the wok lit up brightly. Then, he took a deep breath and put the three medicinal pills inside to perform a threefold spirit enhancement.After the process was completed, the Greengod Spiritgathering Pills in his hand had three silver designs covering its surface. Finally, he placed one of them in his mouth.The medicinal pill dissolved, and spiritual energy began to course through him explosively. Bai Xiaochun instantly began to utilize the breathing techniques and postures of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art, using them to manage the flow of the spiritual energy.A few days later, rumbling sounds filled Bai Xiaochun\u2019s log cabin, and numerous dust particles blasted out in a shockwave. Moments later, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s laughter could be heard ringing out.\u201cFifth level of Qi Condensation!\u201d he said, panting, eyes shining brightly. After eating so many Spirit Tail Chickens recently, his cultivation base had already reached the great circle of the fourth level of Qi Condensation. By eating that one medicinal pill, he was able to easily break through into the fifth level.More filth was expelled out from inside of him, but not as much as before. After washing up, he didn\u2019t immediately take out another medicinal pill, but rather, took time to stabilize his cultivation base. After five days passed, he took out the second of his threefold spirit enhanced Greengod Spiritgathering Pills, and consumed it. As the spiritual energy coursed through him, the river that was his spirit meridian grew larger, and flowed faster, causing his cultivation base to climb higher at a rapid rate.After stabilizing himself for a few more days, he consumed the third Greengod Spiritgathering Pill, and his cultivation base shot up to the great circle of the fifth level of Qi Condensation.By this point, everything about him seemed different than before. His skin was fairer, and there was something unique about his energy.Bai Xiaochun was quite happy, but also realized that, normally speaking, it would be impossible to use only three medicinal pills to break through from the great circle of the fourth level of Qi Condensation all the way to the great circle of the fifth level, and then be only a hair away from reaching the sixth level.As far as he could tell, the only reason he was able to do so was the turtle-wok and its spirit enhancement ability.The more Bai Xiaochun practiced cultivation, the more obvious it was to him how helpful the turtle-wok was. That in turn caused him to become even more curious about its origins.Although it looked like a turtle shell, the more he studied it, the more it seemed that it wasn\u2019t.In recent days, he had looked more into the matter of spirit enhancement, and had learned that Violet Cauldron Peak was known for their spirit enhancement abilities. In fact, if you paid enough merit points, you could even acquire the services of the Elders there to perform spirit enhancements. Word had it that the Peak Lord of Violet Cauldron Peak was a grand master when it came to spirit enhancements.Running his fingers along the designs that covered the turtle-wok, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes glittered. Finally, he shook his head. There were too many things he didn\u2019t understand, and it wouldn\u2019t do any good to waste time thinking about them. Reaching his hand out, he caused the green jade pendant and his wooden sword to appear.These were the only magical devices he owned at the moment. Gritting his teeth, he produced some more Spirit Tails as he prepared to perform threefold spirit enhancements on them.\u201cI wonder what the wooden sword and jade pendant will look like after I do the threefold spirit enhancement.\u201dThe wave of a hand caused the three designs on the turtle-wok to light up. When he sent the jade pendant flying inside, silver light shone, and rumbling sounds like that of thunder could be heard. Thankfully, they didn\u2019t echo out very far, so nobody heard them.When the silver light faded away, the green jade pendant had three silver designs on it, which flickered brightly for a moment before fading away. However, Bai Xiaochun could sense that the jade pendant\u2019s aura was now as different from before as the Heavens were from the Earth.In fact, it was even possible to see glowing violet speks within the green of the jade pendant. Even the shape of the pendant had changed; instead of being oval, it had now been flattened into a circular shape.Bai Xiaochun poured some spiritual energy into it, causing rumbling sounds to echo out as a green shield sprang up around him, fully a meter thick and completely astonishing to behold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Next, he turned his attention to the wooden sword. He had acquired this wooden sword the moment he had joined the sect, and since then, had performed spirit enhancements on it twice.\u201cWith the protective power of this jade pendant, after I perform a threefold spirit enhancement on my little wooden sword, I\u2019ll definitely be completely extraordinary!\u201d Bai Xiaochun smiled, then began to prepare the little wooden sword for the spirit enhancement.Silver light flickered within the turtle-wok. As it faded away, the little wooden sword appeared in front of Bai Xiaochun. Three silver designs gleamed on its surface, then gradually faded away. At the same time, the physical appearance of the sword changed. It was longer by a finger\u2019s length, and the grain of the wood was now virtually completely violet.There was also a bizarre aroma which pulsed out of the sword, an aroma which, upon entering the nose, seemed sweet, but quickly caused the mind to enter a state of confused distraction.Bai Xiaochun trembled for a moment, but then his eyes grew clear. He looked in shock at the wooden sword for a moment, then reached out to grab it, whereupon he found that it was many times heavier than before. Unexpectedly, as he held it in his hand, it felt as heavy as a boulder.Eyes glittering, he examined the sword, and gradually a profound gleam rose up in his eyes.\u201cThis wooden sword is made from the rarely-seen Heavycloud Wood,\u201d he murmured, \u201cwhich only needs to be refined for forty-nine days before you can use it in equipment forging. It can also be used in mass-production.\u201d Next, he focused on the veins in the wood of the sword.\u201cViolet veins. There\u2019s only one explanation for that. After performing these handful of spirit enhancements, these are the signs of the sword\u2019s transmogrification.\u201d Bai Xiaochun closed his eyes and began to review the information about Heavycloud Wood that he had gleaned when studying about plants and vegetation.After a while, his eyes opened, and they gleamed with anticipation. He performed an incantation gesture and then tapped the little wooden sword, which instantly caused a black light to flicker out, within which were tiny violet specks. Suddenly, the sword shot out of the log cabin, across the courtyard, and then another thirty meters or so, where it stabbed into a huge boulder.Without making a single sound, the sword then spun around inside of the rock, pierced out of it, and flew back to Bai Xiaochun.The sword wasn\u2019t damaged at all, and in fact began to emanate a piercing aura.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression brightened. He played around with the sword a little bit more, then once again painted over the designs. Finally, he opened the door of his log cabin, stepped out, and took a deep breath. Unfortunately, as soon as he thought about the competition in two months, his previously high spirits sank a bit.\u201cThis isn\u2019t good enough. I\u2019m still not well enough prepared. The other people in the competition are definitely going to be vicious beasts. I need to do more.\u201d Grinding his teeth, he thought about the second level of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art, which he had read about in the manual.Lightness-in-Heaviness. Heaviness-in-Lightness.Those two levels of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art were powerful magics that appeared when cultivating the art. If both were cultivated to the pinnacle, they could lead to a divine ability called Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning.On the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect, the fundamental techniques of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art were something that virtually everyone practiced. However, few people cultivated Heaviness-in-Lightness, and as for the second stage of Lightness-in-Heaviness, that was even more rare. As for those who cultivated the art to the absolute peak, and could unleash the Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning divine ability, they were most rare of all.Actually, the majority of those who gained enlightenment of Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning were disciples from Violet Cauldron Peak.\u201cLightness-in-Heaviness\u2026. Only by reaching that stage of being able to completely control physical objects can I even be absolutely assured of rising above the pack.\u201d Bai Xiaochun continued to think about the description of the technique as he gazed down at the little wooden sword.Back when he had fought his battle with Xu Baocai, everyone from the Supervisors\u2019 Department and even the Ovens had mistakenly assumed that he had gained enlightenment of Lightness-in-Heaviness. Now that he thought back to the situation, an idea flickered through his mind.\u201cThe reason people thought I had achieved Lightness-in-Heaviness was because of how adeptly I controlled my little wooden sword. However, the real reason behind that was mostly because of how incredible the sword became after my spirit enhancement.\u201cThe truth of the matter is that my ability to control it isn\u2019t actually that incredible, and definitely is not Lightness-in-Heaviness.\u201d Frowning, Bai Xiaochun randomly sat down cross-legged and looked at the wooden sword. Gradually, his eyes grew blank, and were soon shot with blood.A moment later, his right hand suddenly waved up into the air, sending the little wooden sword flying out. It whistled through the air in front of him, kicking up a cloud of dust. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s frown deepened as his right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and then pointed his finger out. However, what he pointed at wasn\u2019t the sword, but rather, the huge rock outside the courtyard that he had just stabbed with the sword moments ago.The wave of his finger caused the huge stone to tremble slightly, then gradually rise up into the air by about one third of a meter. But then Bai Xiaochun\u2019s spiritual energy grew unstable, and it thumped back down with a boom.Bai Xiaochun was not dismayed, though. In fact, quite the opposite. His eyes began to shine brightly. Focusing completely, he circulated his spiritual energy and once again waved his finger.Once, twice, three times\u2026.Time passed. Half a month was gone in the blink of an eye. Virtually that entire time, Bai Xiaochun worked on trying to control the boulder. Of course, this boulder was about as tall as three people put together, and weighed about 1,500-1,600 kilograms. Despite the fact that Bai Xiaochun was already in the great circle of the fifth level of Qi Condensation, manipulating an object like this was not an easy task. 1The only reason Bai Xiaochun could do so was because of the extraordinarily refined state of his cultivation base. Anyone else in the fifth level of Qi Condensation would never be able to move the boulder more than a handful of centimeters.Bai Xiaochun worked hard for an entire month. By this point, he realized that the reason controlling the boulder was so difficult wasn\u2019t because of a lack of spiritual energy, but rather, that his level of control was lacking. Even when he still had plenty of spiritual energy, the connection would always break.\u201cThe key is to move the threads of spiritual energy at a constant speed,\u201d he muttered hoarsely, eyes bloodshot but shining brightly. \u201cThat\u2019s how to make sure they never break.\u201dIt was the same principle that applied to mortals when they were making noodles at home. If you pulled the dough apart too quickly, it would snap. If you went too slowly, it would be impossible to stretch them out very far. You had to use just the right amount of strength, and then you can control the objects smoothly and clearly however you wish.If cultivators wanted to control physical objects to a degree that surpassed the ordinary, they would need to use just the right amount of strength, and maintain stability. Of course, that increased the level of difficulty significantly.\u201cI get it now!\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought excitedly. \u201cLightness-in-Heaviness is about more than the words \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018heavy\u2019. It\u2019s not just being able to control heavy objects as if they didn\u2019t weigh a lot. That\u2019s just the surface meaning. The true, deeper meaning has to do, not with physical objects, but rather, with the way you manipulate spiritual energy!\u201cIn the fifth level of Qi Condensation, your total reserve of spiritual energy is what makes the heaviness. When you take that spiritual energy and convert it into numerous tiny, unbreakable threads, that is the lightness. Doing it correctly is Lightness-in-Heaviness. Of course, with the surface meaning, the result is the speed with which you can effortlessly control physical objects!\u201d After getting to the root of the problem, he waved his hand again, and the boulder began to tremble. Then it suddenly rose up into the air.It was almost as if some enormous hand had simply grabbed it and pulled it up. Then, it began to whistle through the air toward Bai Xiaochun. However, before it could reach him, it suddenly fell down out of the air into his courtyard, where it kicked up a huge cloud of dust.Bai Xiaochun felt no discouragement. He continued to practice for another half a month. Unfortunately, for that entire time, he was unable to maintain one continuously stable thread of spiritual energy.Even when he was able to form a stable thread, the incredible heaviness of the rock ensured that the threads of spiritual energy always grew unstable and broke.Of course, when it came to controlling the little wooden sword, he had no problems whatsoever. Because of the vast difference in weight between the boulder and the sword, Bai Xiaochun now felt that controlling the wooden sword was much, much easier. Furthermore, after the month or more of training, he could move it with much greater speed.In actuality, he really had achieved Lightness-in-Heaviness. However, he wasn\u2019t satisfied. Eyes completely bloodshot, he gritted his teeth, and that vicious determination once again appeared.\u201cI refuse to believe I can\u2019t do it!\u201d He performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, causing the boulder to fly over and hover directly above him.Beads of sweat popped out on his forehead as he looked up nervously at the rock, exerting all the possible effort he could muster to preserve that invisible thread of spiritual energy. After all, if it broke, then the rock would fall. Although it wouldn\u2019t kill him, it would definitely be very painful.This time, he was clearly able to maintain the connection for a lot longer than before. However, after about an hour passed, rumbling sounds began to echo out, and then Bai Xiaochun let out a yelp as the stone smashed down. After a long moment, it trembled and fell off to the side as Bai Xiaochun crawled out from underneath it.Thanks to his Undying Skin, he wasn\u2019t hurt. However, the pain of what had just occurred left him grimacing.Despite that, his resolve grew even more intense. Another month went by, and the rock smashed down onto him over and over again. Eventually, he reached the point where he could actually keep it afloat for an entire day without dropping it.Furthermore, the height to which he could lift it grew greater and greater. Soon, he could hold it thirty meters high in the air. Of course, the pain that resulted when he dropped it from that height left Bai Xiaochun completely pale-faced.However, that was the only way to refine himself to the pinnacle.Gradually, his ability to achieve Lightness-in-Heaviness with his internal spiritual energy was growing more and more stable. Eventually, he reached the point where he almost never broke the connection. However, he still wasn\u2019t satisfied. Next, he didn\u2019t practice while sitting cross-legged, but instead, while exercising.That made things even more difficult, and led to continuous booms ringing out in his courtyard.Time passed, one day at a time. Soon the competition Li Qinghou had mentioned was now only three days away. The scene in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s courtyard was that of a figure zipping around while a 1,500 kilogram boulder floated around up above. Despite how much Bai Xiaochun was moving around, the boulder remained motionless up in the air.Eventually, Bai Xiaochun stopped running around, and stood there in front of his log cabin, laughing heartily. Then, he waved his right hand, causing the boulder to fly out of the courtyard and settle back firmly into the ground.Next, he performed an incantation gesture and pointed out, causing his little wooden sword to slash out in front of him. It moved so quickly it was little more than a blur; clearly it was much more powerful than before.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face lit up with delight, and his hand began to flash with incantation gestures.The speed combined with the might of the sword, resulting in a shocking combination. All of a sudden, the courtyard almost seemed to be filled with innumerable little wooden swords, all flying about.In the end, he flicked his sleeve, causing the sword projections to vanish. Only one wooden sword remained, which then shot back toward Bai Xiaochun and vanished into his bag of holding.\u201cNow I finally feel ready to get into the top 5.\u201d Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath. Although he didn\u2019t feel one hundred percent confident, time was running out. All he could do was settle his qi and calm his mind, then sit down cross-legged to meditate and put himself in the proper state.1. I already did the math, and for a boulder that tall to weigh only 1,500-1,600 kg, it would have to be really, really skinny. I think we can assume that Er Gen either made a mistake in how much it weighed, or it\u2019s some sort of magical rock that doesn\u2019t weigh as much as real-world bouldersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 30: Bring It On!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30: Bring It On!Three days later. Dawn.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes opened at sunrise. He took a deep breath, and a serious expression could be seen on his face. This was his first time taking part in a competition like this.His fight early on with Xu Baocai actually didn\u2019t really count as much of a battle. However, now that he was going to participate in Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s Outer Sect competition, he would be truly fighting against his fellow sect members.He slowly rose to his feet, organized his bag of holding, and then somberly walked out of his residence. Moments later though, he came running back and started rummaging around under his bed until he found the leather coats he still had from back in his days at the Ovens. After donning several layers, he then placed his jade pendant somewhere he could access it easily.Were it not for the fact that it would have led to too many questions, he would have put his turtle-wok on his back.\u201cAh, why didn\u2019t I think of this earlier!\u201d he thought regretfully. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I forgot about that big black wok of mine.\u201d However, he was running out of time, and had no choice but to grit his teeth, turn, and leave. Taking a glance in the direction of the distant sun, his eyes filled with determination. Puffing his chest out, he began to climb toward the top of the mountain.At the moment, he was wearing far too many layers of leather clothing. Even though he didn\u2019t have the big black wok on, he still looked somewhat like a sticky rice dumpling\u2026. He was bundled up so tightly that after walking for only a little bit, he was already starting to sweat.However, even if he sweat more profusely, he wouldn\u2019t shed even one item of clothing. The competition was too important, and he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how brutal it would be. As he walked along the path, he suddenly realized that it was quite a foggy morning on the mountain, and he actually had no idea where exactly he was.\u201cDid I take a wrong turn\u2026?\u201d he thought, and instantly looked around for someone to ask directions from. At the same time, his heart began to thump from the fear of possibly being late.**At the top of Fragrant Cloud Peak was a fighting arena, which was where the competition was to take place. Quite a few people were already gathered there to watch the proceedings, and were chatting in hushed tones.There were even some disciples in the audience who were in the fifth level of Qi Condensation, although most of them stood there with arms folded across their chests as they looked at their Junior Brothers and Sisters who would be participating in the competition. Of course, there were also people there to cheer on their friends.This Outer Sect competition wasn\u2019t very formal, but it was a place where the participants could stand out from the crowd. There were about twenty people who had come to join the competition, all of whom were sitting in the area cross-legged in meditation, preparing in earnest for the fighting to begin.No one in the competition was in the third level of Qi Condensation. Although the rules allowed for that, most of the people who actually joined the competition were in the fifth level of Qi Condensation, although there were five or six who were in the fourth level.There was one young woman among the group who stood out from everyone else. She was tall and beautiful, and her Outer Sect disciple uniform could not conceal her curvaceous form. Anyone who laid eyes on her wouldn\u2019t be able to stop from slipping into a bit of a reverie.Her skin was white like snow, and she had eyebrows that curved as gracefully as willow leaves. She really was spectacularly beautiful. As for the Daoist trousers she wore, although they were loose, they stretched tightly around her rear end in a way that made it virtually impossible for any man to look away.There were quite a few Outer Sect disciples clustered around her, obviously her admirers.Although she couldn\u2019t quite compare to Zhou Xinqi, she was still one of the most famous of the Outer Sect disciples, Du Lingfei. 1\u201cElder Sister Du\u2019s cultivation base is in the great circle of the fifth level of Qi Condensation, so she\u2019ll definitely take first place in this competition. There\u2019s not even any suspense in the matter.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate Elder Brother Chen Zi\u2019ang, though. I heard that he had a cultivation base breakthrough last month. He might not be in the great circle of the fifth level of Qi Condensation, but he\u2019s close.\u201d Standing not too far away from Du Lingfei was an arrogant-looking young man, the same Chen Zi\u2019ang who had been shocked by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bamboo outside the Missions Office that day.Even as everyone was discussing the matter, Chen Zi\u2019ang looked over at Du Lingfei with a strange gleam in his eyes. Although he wasn\u2019t too confident in being able to take first place, he was pretty certain he could take second. Besides, he might also be able to take advantage of the situation to get to know Du Lingfei a bit better.It was at about this point that two beams of light whistled through the air from off in the distance. It was none other than Li Qinghou, followed by an emaciated old man. The old man had swarthy skin, but his eyes shone brightly, and he seemed like a very strict person.The surrounding Outer Sect disciples were completely shocked to find that Li Qinghou would be in attendance at the competition, and quickly clasped hands in greeting.\u201cGreeting, Peak Lord. Greetings, Elder Sun.\u201d Everyone was flabbergasted that the Peak Lord would personally come to an event like this. Small competitions like this were almost always presided over by Elder Sun.Du Lingfei and Chen Zi\u2019ang were also shocked, and had very serious expressions on their faces as they bowed in greeting to Li Qinghou.Li Qinghou looked around benevolently, nodding. As he scanned the crowd of disciples, however, he frowned when he realized that Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t there.When the surrounding Outer Sect disciple saw Li Qinghou frowning, their hearts began to thump. Du Lingfei instantly began to get nervous, unsure of why the Peak Lord might be displeased.\u201cShall we begin, Peak Lord?\u201d asked Elder Sun, who stood next to Li Qinghou.Li Qinghou was just about to reply when, all of a sudden, a sweat-soaked spheroid shape could be seen speeding toward them from off in the distance.\u201cI got lost!\u201d cried Bai Xiaochun as he ran along. \u201cIt was too foggy\u2026.\u201d Not only was Bai Xiaochun very nervous, he also felt that the whole situation was very unfair. After all, he wasn\u2019t very familiar with all the mountain paths, and considering how foggy it had been, he had simply gotten lost while thinking.As soon as the words left his mouth, all of the Outer Sect disciple involuntarily looked over. There were quite a few of them who were familiar with Bai Xiaochun, and when they heard the words he called out, they began to snicker. As for those who didn\u2019t know him, they frowned, and gleams of derision could be seen in their eyes.As far as they were concerned, the only reason he could have for getting lost on the way to the competition was that he rarely ventured up to the top of the mountain, and didn\u2019t care much about the competitions that the sect held. Most likely, he was only used to strolling around for pleasure.Du Lingfei looked at him, and remembered him as one of the people who had been chasing after Zhou Xinqi recently. Supposedly, he had worked hard to catch the great chicken bandit. Du Lingfei immediately turned away in disdain, not willing to even look at him.Chen Zi\u2019ang looked at Bai Xiaochun in complete shock, and couldn\u2019t help but glance over at Li Qinghou. He hadn\u2019t forgotten what Bai Xiaochun had said at the Missions Office about Li Qinghou being his uncle. That would explain why Li Qinghou had been frowning right now, and after analyzing the matter, he realized that when fighting Bai Xiaochun, he would have to be careful not to beat him too badly.Li Qinghou snorted coldly, glaring at Bai Xiaochun for a moment before nodding at Elder Sun.Elder Sun looked thoughtfully at Bai Xiaochun for a moment, then laughed and waved his sleeve. \u201cVery well. All disciples who wish to participate in the Outer Sect fighting competition, please step into the arena.\u201dSeeing Li Qinghou\u2019s glare caused Bai Xiaochun to feel more than ever that the situation was completely unfair. However, he didn\u2019t dare to give voice to his sentiments. As soon as the words left Elder Sun\u2019s mouth, Bai Xiaochun was the first disciple to leap up onto the platform, chest puffed out proudly, looking as though mountains of daggers and seas of flames couldn\u2019t impinge on his honor.Soon, all the contestants were in the arena. Including Bai Xiaochun, there were twenty in total.The rules for competitions like this one were fairly lax. Elder Sun looked at the contestants for a moment, then pulled out a small cloth sack, within which were a collection of marbles with numbers on them. One by one, the competitors filed over to take a marble, which would indicate the order in which they fought.Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t manage to get first in line. He got stuck in the middle, and when he pulled out his marble, it had the number 11 written on it.\u201cVery well,\u201d Elder Sun said coolly. \u201cNow, everyone step back so that the first match can begin. Fighters number one and two, prepare to begin!\u201d Bai Xiaochun and the others quickly left the fighting arena, whereas the disciples with the number one and two marbles remained. As the two stared each other down, brilliant light began to shine in their eyes.Soon they began to fight, and the booming sounds of battle rang out. Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind was racing. He kept telling himself that, considering there were twenty people in this competition, all he had to do was win twice to make it into the top 5. He was also wondering who it was that got the number twelve marble, but no one was willing to reveal to everyone else which numbers they had, making it virtually impossible for him to determine who he would be fighting.Even as his spirits began to fall, the first match ended, and the second began. Du Lingfei was one of the fighters in this match, and she immediately performed an incantation gesture, causing a banner to fly out, which then turned into a stream of mist that enveloped her opponent. After struggling a bit, the disciple couldn\u2019t escape, and conceded, filled with admiration for Du Lingfei.The third and fourth matches went by quickly enough, and when it came time for the fifth match, Chen Zi\u2019ang secured a quick and efficient victory over a disciple in the fourth level of Qi Condensation.\u201cFighters number eleven and twelve, step forward and let the match begin,\u201d Elder Sun called out. Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and walked forward, a very serious expression on his face. After setting foot into the arena, he found that his opponent was a tall, gaunt young man with a cold smile on his face.His cultivation base was extraordinary, in the fifth level of Qi Condensation. His eyes flashed like lightning, and overall, he seemed like the type of person who was not to be trifled with.\u201cWell Junior Brother,\u201d the gaunt young man said, his voice cold, \u201cyou have the bad luck to have run into me in the first round. It\u2019s not too late to concede. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll have to take responsibility for yourself if you get injured.\u201dHowever, in the instant that the words left the young man\u2019s mouth, Bai Xiaochun suddenly let out a powerful roar.The roar was so intense that everything shook, and quite a few audience members were shocked. The gaunt young man was also taken aback, and even backed up bit without even thinking about it, staring at Bai Xiaochun with wide eyes.After roaring, Bai Xiaochun slapped his jade pendant, causing a green glow to surround him. That didn\u2019t leave him feeling safe, though, so he pulled out a big stack of paper talismans, which he rapidly stuck all over himself. Each time he did, they would emit a powerful glow, until he was covered with no less than ten individual shields. Their combined power transformed into a protective wall nearly a meter-and-a-half thick. From a distance, the sight was completely shocking.Because of all the protective shields, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s subsequent shout was actually a bit muffled.\u201cAlright, bring it on!\u201dThe gaunt young man was still staring blankly at Bai Xiaochun, and it wasn\u2019t just him. The other Outer Sect disciples, including the other contestants, were all gaping in shock. In all the times they had observed competitions like this, they had never seen anyone use protective shields to such an extent.Li Qinghou\u2019s face twitched, but from the look in his eyes, it was clear he could do nothing about the situation.Chen Zi\u2019ang took a deep breath as he grew even more certain that Bai Xiaochun and Li Qinghou were actually relatives. However, Du Lingfei simply gave a cold harrumph, and her derision increased.Everyone watched with wide eyes as the gaunt young man down in the arena let out his own roar, then performed a double-handed incantation gesture, causing a wooden sword to fly directly toward Bai Xiaochun.\u2014\u2013http://www.wuxiaworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IMG_8681.jpgAs luck would have it, Er Gen recently released this depiction of Du Lingfei1. Du Lingfei\u2019s name in Chinese is \u675c\u51cc\u83f2 d\u00f9 l\u00edng f\u0113i. Du is a common surname. Ling means \u201cto rise up.\u201d Fei means \u201cluxurious\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, before it could even get close, a pinging sound rang out from the exterior of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s thick meter-and-a-half shield as the wooden sword bounced off of it.As soon as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s protective shields flickered, his eyes glittered, and he breathed a sigh of relief. Clearing his throat, he actually just sat down cross-legged.The audience exchanged confused glances. They weren\u2019t really sure what to say in response to Bai Xiaochun and his extreme level of defense. They had seen people who focused on defense before, but\u2026 had never seen anyone who shielded himself this much.As for his opponent, the young man\u2019s face first flushed, then went pale. Gritting his teeth, he roared, sending his flying sword shooting toward the glowing shields, ratcheting up in power even as it shot through the air.A pinging sound rang out as the flying sword flew in again and again, but each time, it was sent spinning away. Finally, the pale-faced young man\u2019s spiritual energy was more than half depleted, and a look of despair appeared on his face.He had been fighting in duels for years, but this was the first time he had encountered an opponent who hid like a turtle in a shell. However, he wasn\u2019t willing to give in yet. He had joined the competition with the express purpose of taking 3rd place. Staring at Bai Xiaochun with bloodshot eyes, he furiously roared, \u201cGet out from behind that shield!\u201dBai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t scared at all by this young man, so he didn\u2019t have any reservations about staying behind the shield and shouting, \u201cIf you\u2019re good enough, why don\u2019t you come on inside!\u201dStrange expressions appeared on the faces of everyone in the audience as they looked at Bai Xiaochun, not sure whether to laugh or cry. The gaunt young man was so angry that blue veins popped out on his forehead as he clenched his jaw. Finally, he bit his tongue and spit out a mouthful of blood. When it landed on his wooden sword, the entire thing turned the color of blood.Discussion immediately broke out in the audience.\u201cBlood Spirit Magic!\u201d\u201cFor him to use that magical technique shows that he really has been driven to madness!\u201dThe blood-colored wooden sword moved even faster than before, and emitted double the pressure. Blood-colored light spread out in all directions as it shot toward Bai Xiaochun.A boom rang out as the wooden sword pierced a full three inches into the shield. Rumbling could be heard as it tried to pierce further, but failed. In fact, because too much force was being exerted, cracks began to spread out over the sword.A moment later, a pop could be heard as the entire wooden sword\u2026 shattered into pieces, which slowly floated down to the ground.The gaunt young man\u2019s eyes went wide, and blood sprayed out of his mouth. His spiritual energy was vastly depleted, his magical item destroyed, and he was so furious simply passed out.As Li Qinghou watched the scene playing out, his face grew increasingly unsightly. Chuckling wryly, Elder Sun stepped forward, signalled for people to come carry the gaunt young man away, and then declared Bai Xiaochun the winner.\u201cAh, he let me win!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said as the shield light around him faded away. Looking very solemn, he puffed his chest out and clasped his hands behind his back, looking every bit like a Chosen. As for the gaunt young man, as he was being carried off, he apparently heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words, regained consciousness, coughed up another mouthful of blood, and then passed out again.Clearing his throat, Bai Xiaochun turned to Elder Sun and clasped hands. Then he flicked his sleeve and walked out of the arena.The Outer Sect disciples who had come to watch the competition took everything in fairly well. At most, they had strange looks on their faces. As for the contestants, they were looking at Bai Xiaochun with very unsightly expressions.That was especially true of the people who had already won their respective matches. When they compared the gaunt young man\u2019s current condition with Bai Xiaochun, they couldn\u2019t help but feel the need to be on guard.The competition continued, and soon the rest of the matches were completed. Of the original twenty participants, half had been eliminated to produce the current top 10.That included Du Lingfei, Chen Zi\u2019ang, and Bai Xiaochun, who stood there, chin jutted out, looking around at his fellow top 10 competitors. Inwardly, he was saying, \u201cAll I have to do is win one more match and then I\u2019ll have succeeded!\u201dSeeing hope right there in front of him, he felt quite excited.Elder Sun looked over the ten contestants, his gaze lingering on Bai Xiaochun for a moment before saying, \u201cThe top 5 will now be selected. Would the ten of you please step forward to select your marbles.\u201dThis time, Bai Xiaochun scrambled to be first in line, and pulled out a marble with the number two written on it. Afterward, he immediately turned to study his fellow competitors.It didn\u2019t take long for everyone to draw a marble, after which Elder Sun announced that the first two fighters were to begin their match. Bai Xiaochun was joined by a burly, muscular man who, upon seeing who he was fighting, began to laugh loudly.\u201cOther people might fear your defenses, but I don\u2019t care at all about them. I\u2019m also adept with defense, so let\u2019s just wait and see which of us two can hold out for longer!\u201d Laughing, the man slapped his bag of holding to produce a shield. After imbuing it with some spiritual energy, the shield grew larger and began to emit a yellow glow which completely surrounded the man.The man wasn\u2019t done yet, though. Roaring, his flesh and muscles expanded, and he even grew a few inches taller. The entire scene was quite shocking.\u201cI can\u2019t believe its Body Forging magic!\u201d\u201cThat little shield looks familiar. Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s the Dawnlight Shield! That things costs 9,000 merit points!\u201d Everyone was shocked, and as for Bai Xiaochun, his brow was furrowed.When Elder Sun saw what was happening, he nodded his head slightly, eyes shining with a look of praise. Turning to Li Qinghou, he said, \u201cThis kid is Li Shan, fifth level of Qi Condensation. He\u2019ll be a difficult opponent, as he was born with Godly power, plus cultivates Body Forging magic. Not only is he incredibly strong, he also excels in defense.\u201dLi Qinghou nodded slightly, then looked over at Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun was studying the burly man\u2019s transformed body, and the shield he had. He recognized the shield from his visit to the treasure Pavilion, and although he wasn\u2019t sure exactly how many merit points it cost, his frown deepened.Everyone watching the competition seemed very interested to find out what was going to happen, especially the other disciples in the competition, who were clearly pleased to gloat in the misfortune of others.\u201cThat fair-skinned disciple sure got unlucky.\u201d\u201cWell, he got super lucky before, that\u2019s all. Now that he\u2019s facing a powerful opponent like this, he\u2019ll naturally get beaten back into place.\u201dAs the audience discussed the developments, the burly man smiled viciously and then began to stride rapidly toward Bai Xiaochun.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do. I beat the last disciple I fought without even drawing a weapon. My fist is the most powerful magical technique I have!\u201dThe man sped up, causing a wind to blast out. As he closed in, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes glittered and he suddenly waved his finger, causing his little wooden sword to fly out from his bag of holding.Without the slightest pause, it shot out in front of Bai Xiaochun toward the burly man.As it slashed toward him, sword qi built up for dozens of meters around the sword, causing rumbling sounds to echo out.The burly man\u2019s face fell, and his scalp was tingling so hard it felt like it might explode. His eyes widened as an intense sensation of crisis washed through him. Without the slightest hesitation, he fell into retreat. Roaring, he waved both hands, sending his shield out to block the sword.A boom rang out as the wooden sword and the little shield slammed into each other. However, the shield didn\u2019t do anything to even slow down the wooden sword. It was blasted apart, and the wooden sword continued on toward the burly man.The man\u2019s face was filled with shock; even if he were capable of dodging faster, it would do no good. The flying sword was on him in the blink of an eye, causing an icy wind to buffet his face.\u201cI concede!\u201d he shouted without hesitation, his voice rising by a few octaves as he fell to the ground.A buzzing sound could be heard as the wooden sword stopped just in front of the man\u2019s forehead, then turned and flew back into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bag of holding.Bai Xiaochun blinked, also somewhat shocked by the wooden sword. Before, he had only practiced with it, and had no idea it was so powerful. And that was before he even began to utilize Lightness-in-Heaviness.After looking up in thought for a moment, he jutted his jaw out, folded his hands behind his back, and looked coolly at the burly man.The man\u2019s face was pale white, and yet he still didn\u2019t seem to want to back down. Crawling to his feet, he glared at Bai Xiaochun and said, \u201cUsing the power of magical items doesn\u2019t count as winning! I don\u2019t accept this as being a defeat!\u201dWith that, the man turned and stalked out of the arena.Elder Sun looked over at Bai Xiaochun, also astonished by the power of the wooden sword. However, he didn\u2019t say anything other to announce that Bai Xiaochun was the victor.\u201cHahaha,\u201d Bai Xiaochun laughed to himself. \u201cIn the next battle I\u2019ll just instantly concede. I became a cultivator to live forever, right? All this killing and fighting is too barbaric. That\u2019s not how Bai Xiaochun does things.\u201d Bai Xiaochun left the arena, feeling wonderful at having complied with Li Qinghou\u2019s requirement to get into the top 5.Li Qinghou\u2019s eyes had also come to rest on Bai Xiaochun. Although everyone else had been focused on how incredible the flying sword was, Li Qinghou hadn\u2019t been paying attention to that at all. He had been watching the skill and ease with which Bai Xiaochun controlled the flying sword.Seeing that Bai Xiaochun had won another match, the crowd began to sigh emotionally.\u201cAh, this guy must be rich, that\u2019s why he has such an incredible wooden sword. Hmph. If he had any other weapon he definitely couldn\u2019t have won!\u201d\u201cMagical devices have nothing to do with your cultivation. First he used those amulets, then that sword. What a waste! He\u2019s definitely going to go broke eventually.\u201dThe grumblings didn\u2019t last for long though. The next battle soon got underway. Du Lingfei was fighting an opponent with an extraordinary cultivation base. It was a fierce fight, but Du Lingfei didn\u2019t use her banner. Instead, she utilized a flying sword. They fought back and forth in dazzling fashion until suddenly, Du Lingfei\u2019s flying sword shot forward with incredible speed to appear directly in front of her opponent.Such speed vastly surpassed that which ordinary disciples could control, sending the audience into an uproar when people realized what they were seeing.\u201cI can\u2019t believe its Lightness-in-Heaviness!!\u201d\u201cDu Lingfei has actually reached enlightenment of that stage\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Lightness-in-Heaviness!\u201d Deep within Elder Sun\u2019s eyes, the glitter of approval could be seen as he looked at Du Lingfei.Li Qinghou also nodded.Chen Zi\u2019ang was shocked, and most everyone else who had made it into the top 10 had similar reactions. As for her opponent, he chuckled bitterly and clasped hands to concede.Du Lingfei stood there in the arena, looking around proudly. Clasping hands toward Li Qinghou and Elder Sun, she left the arena.The crowd was still in an uproar.However, Bai Xiaochun was left standing there, blinking.\u201cThat level of speed counts as Lightness-in-Heaviness?\u201d he thought, astonished.As Du Lingfei proudly left the arena, slight drops of sweat could be seen running down her face. Despite being in the great circle of the fifth level of Qi Condensation, fighting two successive battles was quite a drain on her spiritual energy. That was especially true of the battle just now, in which her opponent had possessed unusual battle prowess. In the end, she had been forced to unleash her magic of Lightness-in-Heaviness, which was an even bigger drain on her spiritual energy. That was how she had secured victory.Her goal was 1st place, and she knew that subsequent opponents would only be more powerful. Because this particular sect competition wasn\u2019t very strictly organized, she wouldn\u2019t have much time to rest before the next fight. Therefore, she immediately pulled out a medicinal pill, which she consumed, then closed her eyes and began to take advantage of the time to recover.The top 5 now consisted of Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei, as well as Chen Zi\u2019ang. In the end, there were two other young men, both of whom had profound cultivation bases in the fifth level of Qi Condensation.Currently, everyone was in the process of rotating their cultivation bases, taking advantage of every opportunity to replenish some spiritual energy.Only Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t seem to have spent any spiritual energy at all. In fact, he even stood off to the side yawning. When everyone else who had been eliminated from the competition saw that, it left them with the urge to beat him.Now that he had fulfilled Li Qinghou\u2019s demand to get into the top 5, he didn\u2019t care at all about the rest of the competition.Trying to suppress his boredom, he looked over at the other four top 5 competitors, especially Du Lingfei, musing that if the speed she had just unleashed counted as Lightness-in-Heaviness, then he was surely far, far beyond that.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad she has such an extremely murderous aura. Why would a good girl like that be so into fighting and killing? Don\u2019t tell me that all girls who practice Immortal cultivation are weirdos like this? Zhou Xinqi is super proud, and Hou Xiaomei is way too moody.\u201d Bai Xiaochun shook his head. He was just about to look away from Du Lingfei when she seemed to sense that he was looking at her. Her eyes suddenly snapped open to stare at him coldly.As far as Du Lingfei was concerned, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t even worth thinking about. After watching his first two battles, she was of the opinion that he had pulled off lucky wins, which caused the derision in her heart to grow stronger.\u201cWell well, you dare to stare at me, do you?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun immediately ceased any motion of looking away. Instead, his eyes went wide as he glared right back at Du Lingfei. Staring contests didn\u2019t have anything to do with fighting and bloodshed, so from a young age, he had met few people who could overcome him.Du Lingfei frowned. As for the admirers who clustered behind her, they were very irritated, and cast ferocious glares in his direction.However, seeing so many eyes staring at him, and considering that quite a few of them were extremely fierce, Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat. He only had two eyes, so how could he possibly match up? \u201cWell, they have numbers on their side, and besides, true men don\u2019t fight with girls.\u201dWith a harrumph, he looked away.About that time, Elder Sun\u2019s voice rang out across the arena.\u201cVery good, all of you. This competition has gone very well so far. And now, we will continue to narrow down the competitors. Would the five of you please step forward and select a marble. One of those marbles is a free pass into the top 3.\u201d Smiling, Elder Sun produced the bag again.This time, Chen Zi\u2019ang was first. After pulling out the marble, he frowned; his marble had the number four written on it.Du Lingfei was next, who got the number two marble. The other two Outer Sect disciple got numbers one and three respectively.Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even need to draw a marble; the remaining marble was the free pass.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes lit up, and he chuckled. He took his place outside of the fighting arena, arms folded, feeling completely relaxed as he prepared to watch Du Lingfei and all the others. He hadn\u2019t even planned to continue on the with the competition, but now he didn\u2019t have to do anything and he was already in the top 3.\u201cLuck is a big part of strength!\u201d he thought, feeling quite pleased with himself.That very luck caused quite a few audience members to stare at him with even stranger expressions on their faces. Most of them really couldn\u2019t bear to accept the situation, especially the other disciples who had been eliminated, whose hearts were filled with jealousy and envy.\u201cThis guy is totally shameless. Alright, fine, he used a magical item to get into the top five, but then he actually got a free pass into the top three!\u201d\u201cHow despicable. In fact, there\u2019s never been someone as despicable as this to ever show up in the competitions.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even Du Lingfei was feeling a bit jealous of how lucky Bai Xiaochun had gotten. It was the same with Chen Zi\u2019ang. The other four people who had reached the top 5 had all spend a lot of energy already. If they had managed to get the blank marble, it would have given them a bit of breathing room to rest, which would have been an immense advantage during the rest of the fighting.Elder Sun looked at Bai Xiaochun and smiled, whereas Li Qinghou\u2019s expression remained the same as before.Bai Xiaochun looked on excitedly as the next round of fighting began. Du Lingfei\u2019s opponent was a fierce disciple who frequently left the sect on missions to slay wild beasts, and was the type of person who was used to seeing a lot of bloodshed. On the other hand, Du Lingfei\u2019s skill with Lightness-in-Heaviness was quite fear-inspiring. Not only did it provide her with powerful defensive capabilities, but she was also able to move with incredible speed.The audience was completely focused on the match, and occasional \u2018oohs\u2019 and \u2018ahs\u2019 could be heard. Both fighters were clearly in danger of being injured, and yet\u2026 there happened to be a certain voice calling out, taking the lead in the cheering.\u201cWhoah! Nice sword move!\u201cLook at that reverse Dragon Tail attack! Oh no! Look behind you! Quick, look behind you!\u201cRah rah rah!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was really getting sucked into watching the fight, to the point where he even started applauding at key points. It wasn\u2019t an act either; he really was impressed by Du Lingfei\u2019s performance, and by now, had forgotten that he was actually one of the competitors.When Elder Sun saw what was happening, he coughed dryly. Li Qinghou\u2019s face was completely expressionless, but inwardly all he could do was shrug his shoulders. After all, Bai Xiaochun had already accomplished the assigned task.Facing such a powerful opponent, Du Lingfei had no time for distractions. She focused completely for the time it takes an incense stick to burn, and after using Lightness-in-Heaviness three times, she finally secured victory.However, she ended up exhausting over half of her spiritual energy. Sweating, she was just about to walk out of the arena to rest up a bit, when she heard Bai Xiaochun cheering her on. Then she thought about how incredibly difficult it had been for her to get into the top 3, whereas Bai Xiaochun had done it without any effort at all. Irritation rose up in her heart, and she wished she could simply blast him with a powerful attack right then and there.When Bai Xiaochun noticed that Du Lingfei was glaring at him angrily, he blinked a few times, feeling a bit offended. Then he glared back at her, which seemed to push Du Lingfei to the point where she almost couldn\u2019t restrain herself from attacking.Chen Zi\u2019ang\u2019s next fight went a bit smoother. However, he still fought for about the time it takes half an incense stick to burn, and wasted quite a bit of spiritual energy.He was also feeling quite envious of Bai Xiaochun.\u201cWe now have a top 3. All three of you are Outer Sect\u2026 celebrities.\u201d Elder Sun cleared his throat. \u201cPlease come to determine the fighting order. This time, the number three marble counts as the blank marble. Whoever picks it will advance directly to the final match.\u201d Elder Sun waved his hand, causing the bag to appear once again.Chen Zi\u2019ang was the first in line this time, and when he pulled out the marble and saw the number \u2018two\u2019 written on it, he sighed and stepped off to the side.Du Lingfei took a deep breath as she stepped forward. But then she stopped in place and turned icily to Bai Xiaochun.\u201cYou go first!\u201d she said coldly.Bai Xiaochun, who had been watching the exciting fights this entire time, didn\u2019t refuse. He reached into the bag as Du Lingfei looked on with an icy expression. It wasn\u2019t just her that was waiting to see what would happen, all eyes in the audience were fixed upon Bai Xiaochun.Even Elder Sun and Li Qinghou were craning their necks.Being the focus of attention in this way caused Bai Xiaochun to feel a bit embarrassed. Actually, he didn\u2019t even really care which marble he pulled out, and yet when he finally did remove his hand, his eyes went wide with shock.Number three.Bai Xiaochun looked back at Du Lingfei, coughed dryly, and said, \u201cUm, hey, you asked me to go first.\u201dEyes gleaming ferociously, Du Lingfei clenched her hands into fist and stared murderously at Bai Xiaochun. Her chest rose as she took a deep breath; she seemed to be on the verge of exploding.Chen Zi\u2019ang\u2019s eyes went wide, and his jaw dropped. The idea of someone being so incredibly lucky simply exceeded his imagination. Yet again\u2026 Bai Xiaochun would skip an entire match.When the surrounding disciples saw the marble in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hands, they couldn\u2019t restrain themselves. Instantly, a huge commotion broke out.\u201cHe advances automatically again! His name is Bai Xiaochun, right? How\u2026 how could he be so lucky!? He got the blank marble twice in a row!\u201d\u201cHow shameless of this guy! He hasn\u2019t done anything, and yet has made it all the way to the final match\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow could a guy like that make it to the finals? Dammit, if I was as lucky as that, I could do the same thing!\u201d Everyone was in an uproar, and the people who had been eliminated from the competition earlier seemed especially envious.Elder Sun hesitated for a moment and then looked over at Li Qinghou. Li Qinghou let out a long sigh; he had to admit that Bai Xiaochun really had gotten lucky.In Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind, there was no reason for the crowd to react in such a way. Smiling awkwardly, he hurried out of the arena, standing outside with an embarrassed look on his face.\u201cAi. I was planning to concede anyway\u2026.\u201d he thought, looking incredulously at the marble in his hand.Du Lingfei took a deep breath to suppress her extreme irritation. Gritting her teeth, she looked at Chen Zi\u2019ang, simultaneously settling her Qi and clearing her mind. She had done her homework on Chen Zi\u2019ang, and knew that he was a very powerful opponent.Chen Zi\u2019ang smiled bitterly, taking a deep breath as he gazed back at Du Lingfei.After staring off for a few breaths of time, they sprang into action. Almost instantly, booms and bangs began to ring out. This was actually the most spectacular fight in the entire competition so far. Chen Zi\u2019ang erupted with his full power, going to the lengths of throwing out some seeds, which he then catalyzed into full-grown plants with attack powers. When Bai Xiaochun saw him use his skill in plants and vegetation in such a way, his eyes glittered.As for Du Lingfei, she used Lightness-in-Heaviness to send her flying sword whistling through the air. After they had fought for a bit, she then produced a wooden sword, which swirled about in conjunction with the ordinary flying sword, turning the battlefield into an even more spectacular scene than before.The two of them couldn\u2019t keep using their trump cards for very long, and were rapidly running out of spiritual energy. The fighting only continued to grow more bitter.Bai Xiaochun was watching excitedly, whooping and hollering the entire time.The battle went on for about an hour, until a massive boom rang out as Du Lingfei pushed the wooden sword so hard that it exploded. The resulting fragments were then propelled by Lightness-in-Heaviness in a huge attack that Chen Zi\u2019ang simply couldn\u2019t dodge. He was forced into retreat and ended up drawing on all of his spiritual energy. Finally, he sighed and conceded.The surrounding Outer Sect disciples were quite impressed by the intense battle, and their eyes gleamed with admiration as they gazed at Du Lingfei. They were now fully convinced of how amazing she was. As for Chen Zi\u2019ang, his reputation also improved because of the fight.Even though he had lost, he was sure to become even more famous in the days to come.Elder Sun seemed quite pleased, and was even considering taking Du Lingfei on as a personal apprentice.At the same time, no matter how the competition ended, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s name was also sure to spread\u2026.The moment Chen Zi\u2019ang called out that he conceded, Du Lingfei slumped in place in the middle of the arena, her face pale. She was swaying back and forth in exhaustion, her spiritual energy almost completely depleted. Taking a deep breath, she produced some medicinal pills which she instantly consumed. However, she knew that the pills would only replenish so much, and she could only recover completely by sitting cross-legged in meditation for several hours. After all, she had just fought four battles in a row.However, according to the rules of this type of competition, the disciples were not given very much time for rest. After all, it was only a small-scale competition.\u201cBai Xiaochun, get out here!\u201d Du Lingfei said through gritted teeth. Her eyes gleamed with a ferocious light as she looked at Bai Xiaochun standing outside of the arena. She wanted to take advantage of the little bit of spiritual energy she had to defeat this damnable Bai Xiaochun, who had gotten into the final match only by pure luck.As soon as the words left Du Lingfei\u2019s mouth, everyone in the audience turned to look at Bai Xiaochun, eager to gloat in his misfortune. In their minds, even if Du Lingfei was bone tired, Bai Xiaochun had only achieved victory by random chance, and she would be able to defeat him easily no matter the circumstances.Bai Xiaochun blinked a few times, then looked at Du Lingfei standing there unsteadily, and suddenly realized that he\u2026 could actually take 1st place.\u201cThis is the time for Bai Xiaochun to finally become super famous. Once I go out there and use my Lightness-in-Heaviness, then everyone is going to be completely shocked.\u201d Puffing his chest out proudly, he strode into the arena, envisioning the scene of everyone reacting in shock to his win.However, the instant his foot touched down, Du Lingfei\u2019s eyes flickered coldly, and she suddenly performed an incantation gesture and pointed out. Instantly, her flying sword shot toward Bai Xiaochun.A brutal air emanated off of the flying sword, sending intense coldness out in all directions. Clearly this one attack was backed by all of the spiritual energy Du Lingfei could muster, causing the sword to emanate incredible pressure.Even more shocking was that Du Lingfei flew into the air behind the sword, almost as if she were about to merge with it and become one.A boom rang out as the sword accelerated toward Bai Xiaochun with shocking speed, a speed that vastly exceeded the speed she had used when fighting Chen Zi\u2019ang. A piercing whistling sound echoed out as it became a prismatic beam that bore down on Bai Xiaochun.Everyone watching was completely shocked by the sword move, and began to cry out in shock.\u201cSolitary Sword, Flying Immortal!!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe Elder Sister Du is actually using that sword incantation!!\u201dElder Sun\u2019s eyes gleamed brightly, and Li Qinghou nodded. Both of them could tell that Du Lingfei had actually never successfully pulled off this sword incantation. However, at this point in the battle, when her spiritual energy was virtually depleted, she managed to succeed. Using her last bit of energy, she just barely managed to unleash the sword incantation.\u201cBy putting everything on the line, she gained enlightenment of the sword incantation,\u201d Li Qinghou said, eyes gleaming with admiration. \u201cThis Du Lingfei isn\u2019t bad. She actually seems more suited to the cultivation of Green Crest Peak.\u201dAll of the Outer Sect disciples were completely shaken. Everything seemed to turn into a blur, except for Du Lingfei and her flying sword, which merged together into a picture of perfect clarity.The sword whistled through the air, followed by the sword wielder, becoming a powerful attack. Du Lingfei looked exhausted, but her eyes gleamed with a sharp light. She was extremely confident that this sword move would secure her the victory.In almost the exact same instant that the flying sword and Du Lingfei closed in on Bai Xiaochun, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s pupils constricted. Rumbling sounds then echoed out as all of his numerous defensive assets erupted out layer by layer, including the jade pendant and all the amulets. At the same time, he flew backward at top speed.The flying sword was clearly not an ordinary object, and it quickly began to pierce through the shields. It stabbed through layer after layer, collapsing all the defensive shields until it actually reached Bai Xiaochun himself.However, by that point, it didn\u2019t seem to have much energy left. Before it could actually stab into him, it got stuck. Even as he flew backward, the sword keeping pace, it was possible to see the layers of leather clothing he was wearing.When the audience realized this, their jaws dropped, and they gasped.\u201cB-Bai Xiaochun\u2026 has so many defenses!!\u201d\u201cHow terrified of dying is this guy? Is it really worth it? He actually used magical items and talismans for a little competition like this? And on top of all that he wore leather armor!?!?\u201dDu Lingfei\u2019s face was pale white as she watched Bai Xiaochun running away like a rabbit whose tail had just been stepped on. Not only was he moving with incredible speed, her sword was still stuck in his clothing. Gritting her teeth, she performed an incantation gesture and pointed out in an attempt to drag the flying sword back to her. However, she had so little spiritual energy that all she could do was make it tremble a bit.She tried one last time, but even as she tried to circulate her spiritual energy, blood began to ooze out of the corners of her mouth, and she staggered backward several paces, where she stood unsteadily for a moment before dropping down to sit on the ground. Her face was deathly pale, and her spiritual energy was completely drained.In her heart, she felt that it was a big injustice. She had struggled so hard to get into the top 2, whereas Bai Xiaochun had done almost nothing. In fact, he hadn\u2019t even used any of his spiritual energy. Her irritation quickly turned into rage; gritted her teeth, she stared murderously at Bai Xiaochun, wishing she could kill him several times over. In fact, if she had the energy, she would go over and bite him.Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath as he sped backward in retreat; he had never imagined that Du Lingfei would actually use a move like the one she had.Unexpectedly, all of his defenses had been pierced.\u201cFudge, it\u2019s a good thing I was thinking straight and put on eight leather jackets.\u201d He looked down at the flying sword sticking into his shoulder. It was now completely devoid of any energy, and was stuck fast within all the layers of leather. By the time it actually reached his skin, it had nothing left to push it any further.Furthermore, thanks to his Undying Skin, when it actually touched him, it didn\u2019t even match up to a mosquito bite.Fear lingering in his heart, Bai Xiaochun eyed the sword and then carefully pulled it out. Then he glanced over at Du Lingfei, who was sitting there gasping for breath.\u201cElder Sister, you really shouldn\u2019t throw your treasures around like this. Do you want this sword or not? If you don\u2019t want it, then I\u2019ll take it.\u201d Looking extremely pleased, he put the flying sword into his bag of holding, then took out his own little wooden sword. Just as he was about to launch an attack, people in the crowd began to cry out in alarm.Seeing Bai Xiaochun take her flying sword caused Du Lingfei\u2019s eyes to be shot with blood.\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d she said. Just as she was about to flip out completely, she passed out.She was the second person in the competition to faint because of Bai Xiaochun.\u201cEee? What did you go and faint for?\u201d Bai Xiaochun looked at the unconscious Du Lingfei, and then back at his little wooden sword. Finally, he shrugged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many people even began to shout out.\u201cShameless! You are completely shameless, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d\u201cWinning that way doesn\u2019t count and we all know it!!\u201d\u201cDisqualify him!\u201dEveryone joined together in their rage, causing Bai Xiaochun to instantly grow jumpy with fear. He also realized that showing off his Lightness-in-Heaviness ability wouldn\u2019t abate the crowd\u2019s fury, and in fact, could potentially lead to worse consequences, and cause them to call him even more shameless\u2026. Instead, he turned to look at Elder Sun.\u201cElder Sun, I got 1st place, right? Could you go ahead and announce it?\u201dElder Sun smiled wryly in response. As for Li Qinghou, he sighed; how could he ever have imagined that requiring Bai Xiaochun join the competition would result in him taking 1st place?Elder Sun shook his head and chuckled. \u201cUh\u2026 well I guess I might as well. Bai Xiaochun has taken 1st place in the competition!\u201dIn response, everyone stared furiously at Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun was of the opinion that he was actually pretty powerful, but considering how many people there were\u2026 his heart began to prickle with fear. Just when he was about step out of the arena and leave this dangerous location, Du Lingfei, with the help of some bystanders, regained consciousness and sat back up. Panting, she glared angrily at Bai Xiaochun, gritted her teeth, and then cried, \u201cBai Xiaochun, I refuse to admit defeat!\u201cYou might have taken 1st place, but that\u2019s only because I let you have it. And that doesn\u2019t change how much I hate you. Do you dare to have another fight!?\u201dBai Xiaochun gave a sarcastic chuckle and kept walking. In his mind, he would be crazy to fight with this deranged woman again. Besides, what would happen if she passed out again?\u201cI won\u2019t fight you with magic,\u201d she continued. \u201cBesides, as Outer Sect disciples, we\u2019re both apprentice apothecaries of Fragrant Cloud Peak. Why don\u2019t we compete in skill with plants and vegetation?!\u201d Du Lingfei glared at Bai Xiaochun the entire time, and wehen she spoke, her words were spoken slowly and decisively.\u201cIf you win, you can keep that Pinewood Sword of mine. But if you don\u2019t agree, then you\u2019ll regret it!\u201dBai Xiaochun stopped walking. Having heard skill with plants and vegetation mentioned, he couldn\u2019t help but turn his head to look back at Du Lingfei.Seeing that Bai Xiaochun had stopped and was apparently hesitating, she resisted the impulse to unleash a savage attack, and quickly continued, \u201cBai Xiaochun, if you can defeat me in terms of skill with plants and vegetation, then you can even have this Cloudsoaring Incense!\u201d With that, she produced a stick of bluish-purple incense.As soon as the incense appeared, it began to pulse with spiritual energy, and the surrounding Outer Sect disciples\u2019 eyes instantly gleamed with envy.\u201cA tier-1 spirit medicine! Cloudsoaring Incense\u2026 it\u2019s a really remarkable tier-1 spirit medicine. Definitely very expensive, and useful for anyone under the seventh level of Qi Condensation!\u201d\u201cDu Lingfei must have spent a lot of merit points on that in preparation for breaking out of the fifth level of Qi Condensation\u2026.\u201d\u201cElder Sister Du\u2019s skill with plants and vegetation got her into the top 20 of the first three stone steles outside the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion. Bai Xiaochun is definitely going to lose!\u201dBai Xiaochun instantly recognized the Cloudsoaring Incense, which he had read about when studying the introduction to Cloudsoaring Grass in the third volume of plants and vegetation. He was instantly moved, and that was even before he heard everyone mention that Du Lingfei was only in the top 20 on the stones steles, after which his eyes gleamed.Taking a few steps back, he stammered, \u201cY-you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re really in the top 20 on the stone steles of plants and vegetation?\u201dHe actually just wanted to confirm that what he had overheard just now was true.\u201cAre you going to compete or not!?\u201d Du Lingfei said through gritted teeth.\u201cBut I\u2019ve only studied the first three volumes about plants and vegetation\u2026.\u201d he said hesitantly.\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about! Compete with me in the first three volumes! Come on, I dare you!\u201d Du Lingfei was so angry she felt like she was about to explode.\u201cFine\u2026 I\u2019ll compete!\u201d he said. \u201cHappy?\u201d Although he looked as though he wanted to cry, inwardly, his heart was blooming with flowers of joy. He couldn\u2019t help but think that this girl really was a bit dim-witted.As soon as the crowd heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words, they began to boo and heckle him. Du Lingfei took a deep breath, sucking in quite a bit of spiritual energy, which stabilized her a bit. Glaring angrily at Bai Xiaochun, she stalked forward to Elder Sun, then clasped hands and bowed.\u201cElder, Disciple Du Lingfei requests that you bear official witness to a battle of plants and vegetation between myself and Bai Xiaochun.\u201dElder Sun\u2019s opinion of Du Lingfei was increasing by the moment. He stroked his beard for a moment before smiling and saying, \u201cVery well. I shall bear witness. However, since we are speaking of skill with plants and vegetation, perhaps it would be better for the Peak Lord to decide the nature of the challenges.\u201dHe looked over at Li Qinghou. Li Qinghou looked deeply at Bai Xiaochun for a moment, then nodded.The surrounding disciples were now quite excited, as was Du Lingfei, who turned to Li Qinghou, clasped hands and bowed.Bai Xiaochun was also very pleased that he wouldn\u2019t have to engage in any dangerous fighting to make a name for himself. He stood there, no longer looking like he was about to cry, but rather, with jaw jutting out, looking arrogantly out at the crowd in the same way a Chosen would. Du Lingfei snorted coldly.At this point, Li Qinghou glanced at Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei, then began to speak, his voice cool, \u201cThe Dao of plants and vegetation is unpredictable. Although we will limit things to the first three volumes, those volumes contain numerous variables. Today I will present you with two challenges. We shall see which of the two of you can secure victory.\u201d With that, he tapped his bag of holding and produced two seeds.\u201cThese two flower seeds can be catalyzed with spiritual energy. The level of your skill with plants and vegetation will determine how many petals the resulting spirit flowers have. This is how we will decide the winner of the first round.\u201d Li Qinghou waved his hand, sending the two seeds flying to Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei respectively.Du Lingfei caught the seed without any hesitation. At the same time, Li Qinghou sent a medicinal pill flying her way, which she also caught, a look of shock appearing on her face.\u201cTake that pill to restore your cultivation base,\u201d Li Qinghou said calmly. Du Lingfei\u2019s face lit up. After expressing her thanks, she consumed the pill. After a few breaths of time passed, she trembled, and her eyes began to shine brightly; her cultivation base had been completely restored.Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t very happy with that, but he didn\u2019t dare to say anything. Instead, he looked down at the spirit seed lying in his palm, and began to study it closely.\u201cDon\u2019t recognize it?\u201d Du Lingfei said, sneering. \u201cWell I can tell you that it\u2019s a Bluespirit Thistle seed.\u201d With that, she completely ignored Bai Xiaochun, closing her eyes and circulating her spiritual energy, which she then poured into the seed in her hand.Almost immediately, an emerald green sprout climbed up from the seed. It grew rapidly until it was about one-third of a meter tall. Then, it bloomed with a blue spirit flower, and began to grow even taller.Bai Xiaochun looked over at what was happening, and then turned his attention back to the seed, which he continued to study thoughtfully.Li Qinghou was watching Bai Xiaochun the whole time, and soon, a virtually undetectable flicker of surprise could be seen deep in his eyes.While Bai Xiaochun stood there thinking, all of the surrounding Outer Sect disciples were watching Du Lingfei. The plant in her hand was already two thirds of a meter tall, and already had a second flower.By the time Bai Xiaochun sent some spiritual energy into the seed, Du Lingfei\u2019s spirit plant had already already sprouted with three flowers. Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t maintain a steady flow of spiritual energy, but rather, sent it in in fits and bursts. In fact, when the seed sprouted, he even blew the first few sprouts away with a breath of air.After enough time had passed for an incense stick to burn, Du Lingfei\u2019s face was ashen, and she was gritting her teeth. With her final bit of energy, she caused a sixth blue flower to sprout, after which she breathed a sigh of relief. Placing the plant down next to her, she clasped hands and bowed to Li Qinghou.Li Qinghou nodded. \u201cSix spirit flowers, all of them superior-grade. Nice job.\u201dFeeling very pleased with herself, Du Lingfei looked over at Bai Xiaochun. When she saw that his spirit plant wasn\u2019t even one third of a meter tall yet, her sneer widened.The surrounding outer Sect disciples were getting very excited.\u201cElder Sister Du definitely deserves her reputation. That Bluespirit Thistle bloomed with six flowers. That\u2019s incredible! Bai Xiaochun hasn\u2019t even caused one flower to bloom. He\u2019s completely good for nothing.\u201d\u201cA competition of plant catalysis first involves studying the seed, and then using unique catalysis methods to cause it to grow. In that regard, Elder Sister Du is really at the head of the pack.\u201dIn the middle of all the conversations, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s spirit plant gradually reached a height of one third of a meter. Next, a somewhat shrivelled blue flower appeared. Compared to Du Lingfei\u2019s flowers, it looked rather malnourished, and even elicited some laughs from the crowd. But then, all of a sudden, a second blue flower appeared on the short plant. Next was a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, and a seventh\u2026.In the space of a few breaths, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s spirit plant bloomed with nine flowers!!This instantly led to widespread shock and disbelief.Du Lingfei was staring at what to her was a completely unimaginable scene. \u201cBluespirit Thistle blooms with one flower every third meter. How could this plant have nine flowers when it\u2019s only a third of a meter tall!\u201dHowever, things weren\u2019t over yet. Even as the nine small blue flowers appeared, Bai Xiaochun closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and then suddenly exhaled sharply. That one breath contained spiritual energy which settled onto the nine flowers and, in the blink of an eye, caused them to begin to shiver and change colors. No longer were they blue, but rather, indigo!Indigo starts out as blue, but its color is deeper and more profound! 1As soon as people realized what was happening, their eyes went wide with astonishment.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s not a Bluespirit Thistle!!\u201d\u201cIndigospirit Thistle! It\u2019s Indigospirit Thistle, the seed of which is very difficult to distinguish from that of the Bluespirit Thistle! In fact, if you use the catalysis method for Bluespirit Thistle in Indigospirit Thistle, you\u2019ll actually produce a Bluespirit Thistle, except you\u2019ll have wasted the seed!\u201dEveryone was shocked, and were starting at Bai Xiaochun in disbelief.Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes, then placed the Indigospirit Thistle off to the side. Chuckling sarcastically, he clasped his hands behind his back and looked at Du Lingfei.His skill with plants and vegetation had already reached an indescribable level. After studying the seed for a while, he had noticed the differences, and was easily able to tell what type of seed it was.Du Lingfei\u2019s face flickered; to her, it felt as if someone had just slapped her across the face. She staggered backward a few steps, looking first at her Bluespirit Thistle and then at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Indigospirit Thistle. Suddenly, her face flushed with heat. Earlier, she had berated Bai Xiaochun for his lack of knowledge, but then, moments later, he had proven definitively that she had wasted the seed.\u201cThis Bai Xiaochun is definitely extremely lucky,\u201d she thought, grinding her teeth. \u201cI assumed it was a Bluespirit Thistle, and he guessed that it was an Indigospirit Thistle. Well, that was just a lucky chance on his part, not him actually identifying the seed!\u201d\u201cBai Xiaochun takes the first round,\u201d Li Qinghou said coolly. \u201cThat truly was the seed of an Indigospirit Thistle, not a Bluespirit Thistle. They look similar, but some of the veins grow differently. Without studying it down to the finest detail, it\u2019s easy to confuse them.\u201d Looking over at Bai Xiaochun, he waved his hand again, causing a spirit plant to appear.It was a very unique, with four colors, and nine leaves of different shapes. It also had two flowers on it, one black and one white. The flowers almost seemed in sentient, as they were constantly struggling with each other, as if they wanted to suppress each other. Although the plant seemed like one single plant, if you looked closely you would see the signs that it had been grafted together.\u201cThe first round was dedicated to catalysis. As for the second round, it will focus on identification. This particular spirit plant has been grafted together from numerous other plants. Whichever of you can correctly guess the greatest number of graft materials\u2026 will be the winner.\u201dLi Qinghou sent the grafted plant floating out in front of him, then looked over at Bai Xiaochun. Considering he had brought Bai Xiaochun into the sect, he was very curious to see what other surprising things he could do.Du Lingfei gritted her teeth. In her mind, she had just been careless moments ago. Now, she was unprecedentedly focused. Taking out a jade slip, she walked up to the spirit plant.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes gleamed with interest as he also stepped forward and began to examine the plant, occasionally making notations in a jade slip. A moment later, Du Lingfei stepped back, rubbing the bridge of her nose. Then she looked over at Bai Xiaochun with a grim expression on her face. She had identified eight types of plants. The others were types she didn\u2019t recognize.However, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t finished. His eyes were glowing even more brightly as he buzzed around the plant in circles. Occasionally he even cried out in surprise, as if he had just noticed something very interesting.\u201cWow, you can do that!?\u201cWell this\u2026 this is very interesting!\u201dThe crowd looked on silently. None of them believed that Bai Xiaochun could identify any of the plants, and in fact, most of them were convinced that the reason he had catalyzed the Indigospirit Thistle was simply luck.\u201cFaker!\u201d Du Lingfei thought. \u201cYeah, you just keep on faking it!\u201d Inwardly, she was starting to feel uneasy, and her hatred for Bai Xiaochun only continued to grow.Enough time had passed for an incense stick to burn, and Bai Xiaochun was still going. He really was completely absorbed in what he was doing, and had even forgotten that he was in a competition. Seeing a grafted plant like this had seemingly opened up a huge door in his mind regarding skill with plants and vegetation. All of a sudden, he realized that the tens of thousands of medicinal plants he was familiar with were not just useful on their own, but could actually be mixed together.Eventually, he backed up reluctantly, eyes shining with fascination and admiration.Li Qinghou and Elder Sun exchanged a glance, and then Li Qinghou said, \u201cVery well. The time has come to reveal which spirit plants you\u2019ve identified. Du Lingfei, you go first.\u201dDu Lingfei gritted her teeth, then pulled out her jade slip and began to speak.\u201cI saw eight types of plants, including Waterheaven Rhubarb, Coldsole Root, Earthdragon Fruit, Dawnfog Lichen\u2026.\u201d She continued on until she reached the final medicinal plant. \u201cSealwort Flower!\u201d With that, Du Lingfei looked over at Bai Xiaochun, certain that he would never be able to surpass her. Of course, although eight didn\u2019t seem like a lot, it was an incredibly difficult task to identify the various elements of a perfectly grafted medicinal plant like this. Eight was actually quite a bit.\u201cHmph. If Bai Xiaochun is shameless enough to say the same eight plants,\u201d she said coldly, \u201cthen we can can consult the jade slips as proof!\u201dBai Xiaochun cleared his throat, looked around, then flicked his sleeve and pulled out the jade slip that held his notes.\u201cLet\u2019s forget the eight plants that Elder Sister Du mentioned. Other than those, I saw a total of 67 types of medicinal plants. Unfortunately, there were 31 that I couldn\u2019t identify. That means that in the end, I identified 36.\u201d His words instantly sent the surrounding disciples into an uproar.\u201c36? How is that possible!\u201d\u201cSeven or eight should be the limit. How could he possibly have identified dozens?!\u201dDu Lingfei glared coldly at Bai Xiaochun. She simply didn\u2019t believe his words, and assumed that he was going to just randomly guess the types of plants.\u201cJunior Brother Bai,\u201d she said sarcastically, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just say there were 30,000 types of plants. That would cover everything in the third volume of plants and vegetation, so at least you would be certain of guessing a few right.\u201d1. This is a common Chinese expression to express how something that comes after/from something else, is superiorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

None of them believed that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s skill with plants and vegetation could possibly match up to hers.That was especially true after hearing the last thing he said, which seemed completely unbelievable. Obviously, Bai Xiaochun was just going to blindly guess at the grafted plants.\u201cIf Bai Xiaochun really can identify all those types of plants, then his skill with the plants and vegetation of the first three volumes would put him on the same level as Elder Sister Zhou Xinqi! How could that be possible!?\u201d\u201cAh, he\u2019s just being cryptic to confuse everyone. This guy is so annoying! At least he\u2019ll finally be exposed as a fraud!\u201dAs everyone jeered and mocked Bai Xiaochun, he stood there, frowning slightly.\u201cAre you people finished yet?\u201d he said, his expression ice cold, true anger finally burning in his heart. If this were a combat situation, he wouldn\u2019t feel like that. But considering his grand aspiration of becoming a master apothecary, for people to doubt his abilities with plants and vegetation was a huge insult.\u201cYou can say I\u2019m just lucky, and you can say I won because of my magical items. But when it comes to the Dao of plants and vegetation, don\u2019t think that your superficial knowledge enables you to see the length and breadth of Heaven and Earth!\u201dWhen his voice echoed out, solemn and serious, his slight frame suddenly seemed more like a towering mountain. The cold way he looked at the Outer Sect disciples caused their laughter to turn into stares of shock.Even Du Lingfei was taken aback. The Bai Xiaochun in front of her right now seemed like a completely different person than the one from before.Bai Xiaochun snorted coldly and then flicked his sleeve. Abandoning his normally charming yet aggravating demeanor, he stood with his hands clasped behind his back, looked around coldly, and then began to speak, radiating a strange, indescribable energy. \u201cThis spirit plant, which I\u2019ll tentatively refer to as a Black-White Orchid, contains Goldsilver Root, Heavenyellow Leaf, Watery Netgrass, Ninelands Fruit, Spiral Pulp, Bordercloud Bloom, Searchwind Stalk, Yang-Soaking Fruit\u2026.\u201dAs he continued to speak, that energy grew stronger and stronger, leading to strange expressions on the faces of the spectators.That was especially true of Du Lingfei, whose frown deepened as she looked over at the spirit plant. She was familiar with all of the medicinal plants that Bai Xiaochun referenced, which were indeed from the first three volumes of plants and vegetation, and yet she couldn\u2019t see any evidence whatsoever that they existed within the grafted plant.Du Lingfei snorted, still completely unconvinced that Bai Xiaochun was actually identifying the grafted plants. \u201cSeems like you really are just going to recite a bunch of random plants from the first three volumes of plants and vegetation. If you can actually recite all of those plants from memory, then I guess I\u2019ll have lost, and in fact, I\u2019ll admit defeat.\u201dEveryone began to once again ridicule and mock Bai Xiaochun.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. If you\u2019re good enough, then why don\u2019t you recite the entire first three volumes of plants and vegetation!? Then you\u2019ll definitely win!\u201d\u201cTrying to seem cryptic, huh? Superficial knowledge? The length and breadth of Heaven and Earth? You\u2019re the one with the superficial knowledge. If you don\u2019t recognize the plants, just say so. There\u2019s no need to try to pull a fast one. How despicable!\u201dBai Xiaochun looked coldly at Du Lingfei, then back at the crowd. Then he laughed, looked back and the plant, and continued, \u201cGrow Hundredgrass Root for thirty years until it becomes fullgrown Hundredgrass. Remove the stalks and veins, roast them, then soak them in spirit water. After that, graft them onto Skybleak Leaf, and you end up with this distinctive spotting pattern.\u201d Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, causing a slight gust of wind to lift up one of the leaves on the plant, revealing a distinctive spotting pattern.\u201cNine Skybleak Leaves have been combined into a single leaf, and then fed Whiteburn Flowers as they grew. You can see that right here!\u201cWhiteburn Flowers only bloom once they reach one hundred years of age. When they do, you have only one hundred breaths of time to graft them onto a Clover Ginseng, which you can use to feed the Skybleak Leaf. This white flower here is obviously a Whiteburn Flower!\u201cClover Ginseng, when roasted with spirit fire, eventually withers, infusing the ginseng with the essence of the leaves. That will then aid in the growth of Flatshell Seed, and the two can be combined!\u201cThen, that Flatshell Seed\u2026.\u201d As Bai Xiaochun spoke, he gestured grandiosely, pointing out the various parts of the spirit plant which contained the evidence he referred to. His descriptions were very precise, and even included the various techniques involved. Soon, the looks of scorn faded away, and everyone began to breathe heavily. Faces fell, and eventually, all the Outer Sect disciple had looks of disbelief on their faces. There were even some people who cried out aloud with shock.\u201cThis is impossible!!\u201d\u201cHeavens, how could he be doing this!?\u201dEach and every statement uttered by Bai Xiaochun was like an invisible palm slapping these people. After all, all of them were apprentice apothecaries. Earlier, they hadn\u2019t been able to see through the secrets hidden in the spirit plant, but with Bai Xiaochun\u2019s detailed explanation, all of a sudden, it seemed to make more sense.Everything Bai Xiaochun said was correct, and complete. His performance was a like a huge slap in the face to all of the Outer Sect disciples.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that this Bai Xiaochun\u2026 has such shocking skill with plants and vegetation!!\u201d The Outer Sect disciples felt like explosions were going off in their hearts. Their previous ridicule and mockery now caused their faces to burn so hot it hurt.Even more astonishing was that his explanations were obviously inferred in reverse. He was able to discern the grafting method merely by looking at the grafted plant; only someone with an unbelievably advanced skill with plants and vegetation could do something like that.Even Elder Sun\u2019s eyes were wide with disbelief. \u201cHe\u2019s inferring everything in reverse! He\u2026 he understands plants and vegetation to an incredible degree\u2026.\u201cHe\u2019s only an apprentice apothecary, and yet he is able to analyze a spirit plant grafted by the Peak Lord himself. This\u2026 this\u2026.\u201dAs for Li Qinghou, his eyes were shining brightly; he almost couldn\u2019t believe he was looking at the same Bai Xiaochun he knew from before.Du Lingfei\u2019s face was ashen, and she staggered backward. Based on her skill with plants and vegetation, as soon as she heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s explanation, she knew that he was right. In fact, at a few points during his speech, she didn\u2019t even understand what he was saying. By this point, she was feeling completely and utterly embarrassed.Currently, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t using any sort of magical technique. However, every statement he made was backed by his understanding of plants and vegetation, and became like divine abilities or magical items. Du Lingfei was simply incapable of processing what was happening. She felt like lightning was crashing around in her mind, and she backed further and further away, her face growing even more pale.\u201cFlaming Crow-dipper and Nineflames Sky can be used to make the spirit bulblets impervious to strong sunlight. Merge them into Crow-dipper Fruit, and it will give birth to Blackskull Lily! That is the last of the spirit plants that I recognize.\u201d It took Bai Xiaochun about half the time it takes an incense stick to burn to finish his explanation. His eyes flashed like lightning as he scanned the crowd and then eventually looked straight at Du Lingfei.\u201cElder Sister Du. Ladies and gentlemen of the sect. The Dao of plants and vegetation is deep and profound, and contains no absolutes. Were that not the case, it would be impossible for you to make any progress with your skill with plants and vegetation. And yet, you actually want me to list out all of the plants in the first three volumes of plants and vegetation. What\u2019s so hard about that?!\u201d Setting his jaw, he flicked his sleeve and began to recite.\u201cSpiritwinter Bamboo\u2026.\u201cEarthdragon Fruit\u2026.\u201cInkroot\u2026.\u201d His voice was clear and his expression tranquil as he spoke. Complete silence filled the arena. As his words echoed out, they were like a huge invisible hand smacking everyone a second time.Everyone present was filled with profound shame, and gasps could be heard. Some people even pulled out jade slips with information about plants and vegetation, which they compared with what Bai Xiaochun was saying. Soon, they began to tremble, and their shock increased.Du Lingfei\u2019s face was deathly pale as she backed up, looking at Bai Xiaochun as if he were a ghost.The reason she had spoken such snide words earlier was because she had never seen anyone actually recite 30,000 different types of medicinal plants. To her, it seemed like an impossibility. If someone was actually able to do that, then they had to already possess completely Heaven-defying skill with plants and vegetation.As time passed, Bai Xiaochun spoke more and more quickly. With almost a single breath, he talked for two hours straight. To the audience, it almost seemed like no time had gone by at all, and virtually everyone had taken out jade slips to study along with Bai Xiaochun\u2019s recitation. 1After two hours, he finished reciting all of the medicinal plants. Then, there was deathly silence for a moment, followed by an explosive outburst that was audible even outside of the arena.\u201cHeavens\u2026. Not a single mistake! He was completely correct\u2026. I can\u2019t believe I just witnessed this happen!!\u201d\u201cAll 30,000 medicinal plants\u2026. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s skill with plants and vegetation is simply shocking. Wait\u2026 what is his ranking on the stone steles of plants and vegetation?\u201d\u201cFor Du Lingfei to compete with Bai Xiaochun in skill with plants and vegetation is like throwing an egg at a rock!\u201dAs the uproar went on, Du Lingfei looked at Bai Xiaochun with increasing bitterness. Her reaction to losing in the fight hadn\u2019t lead to a feeling like this. But right now, in terms of skill with plants and vegetation, she had been utterly and thoroughly defeated.How could she ever have imagined that Bai Xiaochun, with his incredible luck and multitude of magical items, would actually be so monumentally ahead of her in skill with plants and vegetation?It was a huge blow to her, and she couldn\u2019t help but laugh bitterly. She threw the Cloudsoaring Incense over, then turned and fled the arena. It was simply impossible for her to even consider staying, considering how embarrassed she was.Now that Du Lingfei was gone, the other surrounding Outer Sect disciples started to feel even more embarrassed. They quickly clasped hands and bowed to Bai Xiaochun, then hurried off. It was easy to imagine how long the profound shock they felt would last.Soon, the arena was virtually empty. Bai Xiaochun was the only one left behind, coughing dryly. He realized\u2026 that he had really done it this time. Putting the Cloudsoaring Incense away, he looked over cautiously at Li Qinghou.\u201cApprentice\u2026 will take off now,\u201d he said, turning and leaving so fast that he almost left behind a dust cloud.Elder Sun watched Bai Xiaochun leaving, and his the shock in his eyes was still evident.\u201cPeak Lord, this kid\u2026 is outstanding!\u201d he said softly.Li Qinghou threw his head back and laughed loudly, then waved his sleeve and shot back up toward the top of the mountain.1. Okay so I did the math, and for him to recite 30,000 words in two hours would require him to say over four plants per second. The fastest talker in the world can speak about eight words per second, so it\u2019s not impossible!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For the first time in his life, Bai Xiaochun felt famous. Now, he enjoyed leaving his residence. He would even approach random people and start to chat with them, all in the hopes that they would ask who he was, whereupon he would proudly reveal his name.Bai Xiaochun really enjoyed living such a luxurious life. He also performed a threefold spirit enhancement on Du Lingfei\u2019s medicinal pill. Consuming that pill then pushed him from the great circle of the fifth level of Qi Condensation all the way into the sixth level.As far as his Lightness-in-Heaviness magic, the more he practiced with it, the more refined it became. In fact, he had even begun to probe the second level of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art, which was Heaviness-in-Lightness.Although it seemed incredibly difficult at first, after numerous attempts, he made a bit of progress.On one particular day, he was seated cross-legged in his courtyard, practicing Heaviness-in-Lightness, when suddenly his expression flickered. Putting away his wooden sword, he looked up at the main gate of the courtyard. A moment later, someone knocked.\u201cElder Brother Bai, are you home?\u201d After hearing the familiar voice, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s brow furrowed slightly. People didn\u2019t often come to visit him in his courtyard. He waved his finger toward the gate, which creaked open to slowly reveal a gaunt young man.He wore the garments of an Outer Sect disciple, and his expression was very serious as he clasped hands and bowed deeply.\u201cXu Baocai offers greetings, Elder Brother Bai.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked, looking shocked. This young man was the very same Xu Baocai with whom he had fought back in the Ovens, when he was in the third level of Qi Condensation. Apparently, Xu Baocai was now an Outer Sect disciple.After seeing that Xu Baocai was still in the third level of Qi Condensation, however, he felt much more relaxed. Putting a very stern expression on his face, he said, \u201cWhat, now that you\u2019re an Outer Sect disciple you refuse to let bygones be bygones? You still want to fight me?\u201dXu Baocai immediately shook his head. A wry smile on his face, he once again bowed to Bai Xiaochun.\u201cI was ignorant and foolish back then. Please don\u2019t ridicule me, Elder Brother Bai. I\u2019ve come today to apologize for what happened. Let\u2019s forget about all that.\u201d Xu Baocai seemed very earnest about wanting to forget about everything that had gone on. After all, now that he was an Outer Sect disciple, past matters weren\u2019t really very important.The most important thing was that Bai Xiaochun was now very famous on Fragrant Cloud Peak. Now that Xu Baocai was an Outer Sect disciple on that very same mountain, he obviously wanted to avoid any complications that could arise because of the past.Bai Xiaochun blinked, thinking back to everything that had happened back then in the Ovens. In some ways, Xu Baocai counted as an old friend. He quickly rose to his feet and invited Xu Baocai in, whereupon they sat down and began to reminisce.Thinking back to that unforgettable Blood Notice, Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cNow that you mention it, back then, I really didn\u2019t understand why you would write the character \u2018die\u2019 so many times with blood. Eventually I got it, but even then, I was always curious; didn\u2019t it hurt to use so much blood to write so many characters?\u201dXu Baocai\u2019s face flushed with embarrassment when he thought back to his outlandish behavior back then, and he quickly changed the subject.\u201cElder Brother Bai, you need to be careful about the people from the Supervisor\u2019s Department. I heard that Chen Fei and the others who you forced into the Outer Sect have been harboring a grudge this entire time.\u201d\u201cChen Fei?\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart instantly filled with vigilance as he thought back to that burly, muscular man from the Supervisor\u2019s Department.\u201cWhat level is his cultivation base now?\u201d he asked, looking very serious.\u201cI heard he\u2019s in the great circle of the fourth level of Qi Condensation,\u201d Xu Baocai replied immediately, hoping that revealing these matters to Bai Xiaochun would clear the air between them.When Bai Xiaochun heard the fourth level of Qi Condensation mentioned, he felt a bit better, and actually looked even calmer than before.Xu Baocai didn\u2019t go into further explanations. He and Bai Xiaochun began to chat about the sect, and soon Bai Xiaochun realized that Xu Baocai actually knew a lot more than he did. He seemed to be in the know regarding just about everything that occurred on the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect. He knew about the big events and the inconsequential matters, and had even heard about things that were supposed to be big secrets. Eventually they started talking about the latest gossip, and the discussion got even more lively.\u201cElder Brother Bai, did you know there are five beauties here in the Spirit Stream Sect, each one of them astonishingly good-looking? Cultivators like us who could be with even one of them would be able to live life without regrets.\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s interest was piqued, so he asked Xu Baocai to explain further.Bai Xiaochun wanted to hear, and this was a subject Xu Baocai loved talking about, so his eyebrows instantly shot up with excitement.\u201cThe five beauties are virtually on equal footing when it comes to how pretty they are. However, their positions within the sect are all different. In first place is Xu Meixiang, Master-Aunt Xu, who is truly ethereally beautiful and alluring\u2026. Oh, right, she\u2019s Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s Master.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Bai Xiaochun was truly shocked to hear this news. Big Fatty Zhang had mentioned his Master on several occasions, and had always called her an old shrew. Then he thought back to how skinny Big Fatty Zhang had been when they reunited, and how it was because that old shrew hated fat people.All of a sudden, things made more sense to Bai Xiaochun. Clearing his throat, and his mind, he decided not to think about the matter further. It was simply too dangerous.\u201cThe next two in the rankings are actually from Fragrant Cloud Peak. The first is Zhou Xinqi, Elder Sister Zhou, and then Du Lingfei, Elder Sister Du.\u201d Xu Baocai was explaining everything he knew, so when he brought up Zhou Xinqi, it also necessitated talking about Chosen.\u201cElder Brother Bai, you probably already know that on the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect, there are three great Chosen. One of them is Zhou Xinqi from our Fragrant Cloud Peak. Another is Lu Tianlei from Violet Cauldron Peak, and the last is\u2026 Shangguan Tianyou from Green Crest Peak! All three of them are consummate geniuses!\u201d Xu Baocai\u2019s eyes gleamed with envy. 1\u201cIf they\u2019re so awesome, how come they\u2019re in the Outer Sect like us?\u201d asked Bai Xiaochun, his mouth twisted in a bit of a sneer. Although he didn\u2019t know much about Shangguan Tianyou and Lu Tianlei, he had already encountered Zhou Xinqi. In fact, the jade pendant in his bag of holding had been a gift from her.Xu Baocai coughed dryly. Although he inwardly looked down on Bai Xiaochun, he didn\u2019t dare to express that feeling, and instead chuckled wryly and said, \u201cElder Brother Bai, if it weren\u2019t for the strict sect rules, those three would already have left the Outer Sect for the Inner Sect. Even still, they\u2019re extremely famous, and fully deserve to be known as the number one figures in the Outer Sect. Even the Inner Sects fear them. Once their cultivation bases reach the proper level, they\u2019ll definitely become stars in the Inner Sect too! Although, for them, even the Inner Sect will just be a springboard to their eventual goal of becoming Successor disciples!\u201dBai Xiaochun still wasn\u2019t very convinced.\u201cTake Zhou Xinqi for example. Because of her spirit meridian of plants and vegetation, she\u2019ll definitely inherit the mantle of Peak Lord Li, and will become a master apothecary of the Spirit Stream Sect. And then there\u2019s Lu Tianlei. He grew up in a very poor family, and started out as skinny as a piece of firewood. But he had a rare spirit meridian of lightning, and the magical techniques he cultivates are of the path of the Dao of lightning. In fact, the Sect Leader personally said that he\u2019ll have an extraordinary future.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked, clearly surprised. He was no longer a newcomer to the cultivation world, and understood a lot about how things worked. When he heard about the spirit meridian of lightning, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit jealous. A spirit meridian like that would cause one\u2019s magical techniques to be explosively powerful, and would ensure that few bottlenecks came up within cultivation.Seeing that Bai Xiaochun was finally reacting like people usually did when hearing about these things, he went on to talk about the third person: \u201cOf course, there\u2019s also Shangguan Tianyou, who\u2019s even more amazing. He has a Sword Spirit body, and some people even say that he\u2019s the reincarnation of some almighty sword cultivator. For some reason, it\u2019s like the Heavens are guilty, and have blessed him with an entire life of good fortune. When he was three, he was walking down the road and happened to find an ancient sword; when he was seven, a baby Crimson Cloudbeast fell out of the sky and instantly accepted him as its master; when he was thirteen, he acquired a golden light shield. That is why his name is Tianyou, and as soon as he joined the sect, the Prime Elders were completely shaken.\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were wide, and he looked somewhat perturbed. \u201cThe Heavens are guilty!?!? Three years old\u2026? What luck! What kind of\u2026 wait, he\u2019s the reincarnation of some almighty ancient cultivator?\u201dIn that moment, he decided that he would definitely not do anything to provoke Shangguan Tianyou, who even the Heavens catered to.Xu Baocai was extremely pleased to see Bai Xiaochun so shocked, so he sighed and then decided to explain a bit about Foundation Establishment. \u201cThose three will definitely reach Foundation Establishment. Elder Brother Bai, we cultivators start out as servants and then join the Outer Sect. We liken our promotion to the fish which leapt over the dragon gate. However, the truth of the matter is that only by breaking through from the Qi Condensation stage to Foundation Establishment can you truly be that fish who leapt over the dragon gate. It is only then that your life actually changes, and you truly shed that which is mortal. That is the true path of Immortality, when your longevity is increased by a hundred years.\u201dEven as Xu Baocai sighed, Bai Xiaochun heard about an increase of one hundred years of longevity, and his eyes lit up with a light more intense than anything which had ever been seen before in his eyes. He even began to tremble, and his mind filled with rumbling sounds. He reached out and grabbed Xu Baocai by the arm.\u201cDid you just say that after you reach Foundation Establishment you get an extra hundred years of longevity?\u201dXu Baocai stared at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bloodshot eyes in shock. Feeling a bit frightened, he nodded his head.Bai Xiaochun inhaled sharply, and then began to pace back and forth within his courtyard, waving his arms around and gesticulating wildly. He almost looked like he had gone crazy, and was muttering to himself and laughing maniacally.Xu Baocai was now really scared, and had no idea what was going on. A chill ran down his spine, and he said that he was going to leave. Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even notice; it was almost as if he had been bedeviled.Xu Baocai took a deep breath and sped away in fear.After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, Bai Xiaochun looked up, his hair disheveled as he took a long, deep breath. Then he threw his head back and laughed loudly.\u201cOne hundred years! Foundation Establishment! I\u2019m definitely going to reach Foundation Establishment!\u201d1. Lu Tianlei\u2019s name in Chinese is \u5415\u5929\u78ca l\u01da ti\u0101n l\u011bi. Lu is a common surname, Tian means \u201cHeaven\u201d or 'sky.\u201d Lei means \u201crocky\u201d or \u201cuneven.\u201d Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s name in Chinese is \u4e0a\u5b98\u5929\u4f51 sh\u00e0nggu\u0101n ti\u0101ny\u00f2u. Shangguan is a relatively uncommon two-character surname. Tian means \u201cHeaven\u201d or 'sky.\u201d Yu means \u201cblessed\u201d or \u201cprotected.\u201d Together, the name \u201cTianyou\u201d basically means \u201cblessed by Heaven\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the following days, he went to the Scripture Pavilion on numerous occasions, and eventually, even went to the Divine Might Hall.The Divine Might Hall was a place where much general information about the cultivation world was gathered for the purposes of study. After studying the detailed explanation about Foundation Establishment, Bai Xiaochun confirmed that what Xu Baocai had said was accurate, and it was like a spark was lit within him.In his view, only by reaching Foundation Establishment could he truly take his first step upon the road of eternal life.What got him even more excited was the information about how there were three ways to reach Foundation Establishment, each of which affected longevity in a different way. At long last, he had a much clearer understanding.\u201cHeaven, Earth, and Man. Three types of Foundation Establishment\u2026.\u201cFoundation Establishment via the Dao of Man requires a Foundation Establishment Pill. The probability of success is low, but if you succeed, you acquire a hundred years of longevity.\u201cFoundation Establishment via the Dao of Earth involves absorbing Earth energy and transforming it into shocking power. The probability of success is even lower, but the result is an addition of two hundred years of longevity!\u201cLast is the legendary\u2026 Foundation Establishment via the Dao of Heaven! That\u2019s very rare, and can only come via random chance. However, if you can succeed with that type of Foundation Establishment, then you get an extra five hundred years of longevity!\u201d After more detailed study, Bai Xiaochun confirmed that Foundation Establishment via the Dao of Heaven could not be specifically pursued. As for Foundation Establishment via the Dao of Earth, there were special requirements to be able to acquire Earth energy.Therefore, the simplest thing for him to do was aim for Foundation Establishment via the Dao of Men, which required a Foundation Establishment Pill.Bai Xiaochun put down the jade slip he was holding and took a deep breath, his eyes shining brightly. \u201cI need to start planning for the future, and make sure I\u2019m completely prepared. And I have to get one of those Foundation Establishment Pills\u2026.\u201cFoundation Establishment Pills are expensive, and just to be prepared for all possibilities, I should definitely have more than one on hand. In that case\u2026 the best thing to do would be to concoct some myself!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered as his dream of becoming a master apothecary and concocting a Live-Forever Never-Die pill became even stronger than ever.\u201cApprentice apothecary, journeyman apothecary, master apothecary\u2026. Right now I\u2019m an apprentice apothecary. To become a journeyman apothecary, I have to concoct some medicinal pills and take the promotion test\u2026. The minimum requirement for the test is that you master the fifth volume of plants and vegetation. But that alone is no guarantee. I also need to completely master all five volumes of spirit creatures.\u201d Eyes gleaming with determination, he pulled out the jade slip that contained the third volume of plants and vegetation and went through it in detail one more time. After confirming that he had memorized everything, he immediately left his courtyard.However, moments later, he came running back and quickly put on several layers of clothing, and also disguised himself a bit. Only then did he actually leave.\u201cThose fans of Zhou Xinqi are too frightening. Supposedly they\u2019ve been telling people they\u2019re going to cut me to pieces\u2026. I really have no choice other than to keep a low profile.\u201d He still felt a little bit uneasy.After considering the difference between himself and Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans, he finally reached a decision. \u201cHmph. Just wait until I reach Foundation Establishment. Then I\u2019ll make a big scene and tell everyone that I\u2019m Lord Turtle. Then we\u2019ll see who dares to try to cut me to pieces!\u201dAs usual, the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion was completely packed. It wasn\u2019t just Outer Sect disciples from Fragrant Cloud Peak in attendance, there were also disciples from Green Crest Peak and Violet Cauldron Peak, who for various reasons were required to be proficient in plants and vegetation.Currently, Bai Xiaochun was worming his way through the crowd, trying to make sure he didn\u2019t attract any attention. After reaching the log cabin dedicated to the third volume of plants and vegetation, he snuck in, took the test, then melted back into the crowd.Although he had originally planned to just leave, after a moment passed, he couldn\u2019t hold back from popping his head up and looking around. It didn\u2019t take long before a clamor rose up as people realized that on the stone stele of the third volume of plants and vegetation, the turtle design had overtaken the magic bottle.Feeling quite pleased, he plastered a shocked look on his face and shouted out in astonishment. However, it only took a moment for Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fiendish fans to appear, which caused Bai Xiaochun to ball his fists in frustration.\u201cIt\u2019s their fault that I have to keep such a low profile,\u201d the thought angrily. He glared at them for a moment and then turned and hurried away.In the following days, news about the little turtle once again spread like wildfire through Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s Outer Sect. Everyone was talking about the little turtle design that was so prominently displayed on the stone steles.However, another month later, just as the rumors were beginning to settle down, the disciples outside the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion suddenly noticed that the little turtle had appeared on the fourth stone stele, and it had once again passed the magic bottle to take 1st place.The result was an instant uproar!\u201cThe little turtle is going to completely surpass Elder Sister Zhou Xinqi soon! He has four 1st place spots!\u201d\u201cHe has four stone steles, and Elder Sister Zhou Xinqi has five. Just who is the little turtle\u2026?\u201dOf course, it was Bai Xiaochun shouting these things out, and it made him feel quite good. However, when Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans started devolving into a frenzy, he cleared his throat, lowered his head, and went on his way.A few days later, Zhou Xinqi showed up in the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion and studied the four stone steles, a very serious expression on her face. Then she entered the tenth stone stele. When she emerged, her name now occupied the 1st place spot.By that point, all of the Outer Sect disciples on Fragrant Cloud Peak were paying close attention to the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion. Zhou Xinqi had her six stone steles, and the little turtle had four\u2026.Everyone was speculating as to whether or not the little turtle would eventually take a fifth stone stele, which would put him on par with Zhou Xinqi.In fact, some of the Outer Sect disciples were starting to place bets on whether or not the little turtle could actually take 1st place in five stone steles. It even reached the point that some of the Elders of Fragrant Cloud Peak were taking note.Bai Xiaochun was going absolutely all out to try to take that next 1st place spot. After getting the relevant jade slip, he studied it day and night. Coupled with how much he hated Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans, whenever he made his monthly visit to the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion and got a first place spot, he would make a point of whipping up the crowd in favor of the little turtle.Gradually, quite a few disciples began to admire the little turtle, and much of that had to do with Bai Xiaochun himself. He never passed up an opportunity to promote the little turtle to whomever he could speak to about it. For example, by this point, Hou Xiaomei was thoroughly obsessed.Eventually, a month later on a bright and sunny day, the magic bottle on the fifth stone stele flickered and then dropped down by one spot, whereupon the little turtle appeared above it.As of that moment, the Outer Sect disciples of Fragrant Cloud Peak were thrown into pandemonium. Entire crowds came to check out the scene, and soon, all conversations on the mountain revolved around the little turtle.\u201cThe little turtle\u2019s skill with plants and vegetation is definitely at an indescribable level. How else could he be so shocking?\u201d\u201cSo awesome! The little turtle and Elder Sister Zhou are about the same now\u2026.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that nobody in the crowd suspected that the little turtle might be Bai Xiaochun. In fact, some of Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans didn\u2019t ignore any possibilities, and naturally were paying attention to him.Feeling quite indignant, Bai Xiaochun decided that he needed to get rid of any doubts, so he made a big scene of reluctantly trying to take the test for the fourth stone stele. He remained inside for a bit, after which he stepped out and did his best to convince everyone that he had performed badly.After doing this a few times, Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans started to shift their attention to others. Of course, there was no way to prove anything about anybody one way or another.However, they continued to spread hateful gossip, telling people that if they found out who the little turtle was, they weren\u2019t going to cut him into bits, they were going to cut him into teeny tiny bits!When Bai Xiaochun heard about that, and thought about what he would look like in such a state, he began to tremble. Finally, he gritted his teeth, and his vicious determination once again bubbled up.\u201cNot happy, huh? Well I\u2019ll make you even less happy when I take more 1st place spots!\u201d Gritting his teeth, he decided that he was going to make that happen, and close the distance between himself and Zhou Xingqi.A month later, the little turtle took 1st place on the sixth stone stele!After another month, it took 1st place on the seventh!Shouts of alarm and astonishment rang out around the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion at that point.\u201cSeven 1st place spots! Go, little turtle, go! Not even Elder Sister Zhou was able to get ten 1st place spots!\u201d\u201cHahaha, I like this little turtle. He\u2019s definitely going to pull it off!\u201dEven as numerous disciples in the crowd were crying out such things, there were a dozen or so young men in the area, all of whom had very grim expressions on their faces. Some of them were even Inner Sect disciples, whose expressions were particularly icy. One of them was a young man with a pockmarked face, whose eyes glinted with particular ferocity.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, fellow disciples,\u201d he called out. \u201cIf anyone knows who the little turtle is, please tell me, and I\u2019ll owe you a favor!\u201d That pock-faced young man\u2019s voice caused everyone to tremble, and instantly silenced all of the voices calling out about the little turtle.People in the crowd immediately recognized who this young man was, and quickly averted their gazes. Others were incensed, but were too afraid to speak up.\u201cThat\u2019s Elder Brother Qian from the Court Hall, Qian Dajin\u2026.\u201d\u201cI heard that he\u2019s been chasing both Elder Sister Zhou and also Du Lingfei\u2026.\u201dBai Xiaochun stood there in the crowd, glaring at the pock-faced Qian Dajin with righteous indignation. Finally, he stalked back to his courtyard, feeling very irritated.\u201cYou can\u2019t even find me, and yet you insist on fighting a duel with me!?\u201d Setting his jaw, he focused on studying the fifth volume of spirit creatures. As he learned more about how the various parts of spirit creatures could be used when concocting spirit medicines, his skill with plants and vegetation made further advancement.In fact, because he was able to compare and contrast the two, and see how they worked together, his skill with plants and vegetation actually experienced significant growth.The next month, the little turtle design replaced the magic bottle as the 1st place spot holder on the eighth stone stele!After another month, he took 1st place in the ninth!He now had nine 1st place spots!The Outer Sect disciples around the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion were aboil. More and more people were loudly proclaiming that the little turtle was definitely going to take ten 1st place spots.As for Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans, there was nothing they could do to stop it at this point. All they could do was watch as the little turtle\u2019s popularity gradually exceeded Zhou Xinqi\u2019s.When the final month came, Bai Xiaochun went to the 10,000 Medicines pavilion when it was at its busiest. He went in disguise, but his expression was one of determination as he worked his way unnoticed through the line leading up to the log cabin beneath the tenth stone stele.Once he entered, he sat down cross-legged, reached out, and placed his hand onto the stone altar. Rumbling filled his mind as he once again entered that familiar void.In front of him were 1,000,000 flickering fragments of medicinal plants and spirit creatures. Eyes gleaming with focus, his hands began to fly about and reorganize the pieces.1,000. 5,000. 10,000\u2026.30,000. 50,000. 80,000This was the most difficult of all the tests he had taken so far. Soon, sweat was dripping down his face, and his eyes were bloodshot. He looked crazed, as if he had forgotten about everything else. He was fully immersed in the process of reconstructing plants and vegetation, and spirit creatures. His hands hurt, and his mind reeled, and yet he kept going.Before long, the test was over, and Bai Xiaochun sat here, his hands trembling as he put the last medicinal plant together. With that, his vision went blurry, then cleared, and he was back in the log cabin.Breathing heavily, eyes shining with satisfaction, he wiped the sweat from his brow and clenched his fists.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 37: Heaviness-in-LightnessPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37: Heaviness-in-LightnessTen stone steles, ten 1st place spots!The three peaks on the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect were completely shaken.Outside the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion, a buzz of conversation could be heard. People were speeding over from all directions to catch a glimpse of the little turtle in 1st place on all ten stones steles. Gasps rang out.\u201cTen 1st place spots! The little turtle actually did it!\u201d\u201cThe last time anyone in the Spirit Stream Sect ever took ten 1st place spots in the stone steles was a thousand years ago! How could I ever have imagined that I would see something like this in my life!?\u201dEveryone was clamoring in shock, and although many people had predicted that this would happen, it was still a shocking event. That was especially true considering the previous three months, in which one stone stele after another fell into the hands of the little turtle. When people thought about that, they simply couldn\u2019t stay calm.\u201cJust who exactly is the little turtle\u2026? In less than half a year, he started from the third stone stele and then swept through all his competition in the rest of them. This guy is totally famous!\u201d\u201cHis skill with plants and vegetation completely exceeds Zhou Xinqi\u2019s. Maybe in the future, there will even be another master apothecary in addition to Zhou Xinqi!\u201dIn the same moment that the little turtle secured 1st place on all ten stone steles, the steles began to vibrate, letting off intense rumbling noises that that merged together, and then were joined by the sound of a clanging cauldron coming from further up the mountain.It was as if someone were striking a medicine cauldron with an enormous log. The muffled booms spread out through all of Fragrant Cloud Peak, and then echoed out to fill the entire south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect. It was accompanied by a medicinal aroma that filled the area, and caused the mists that covered Fragrant Cloud Peak to grow even thicker.At the top of Fragrant Cloud Peak was an Immortal\u2019s cave where Elder Zhou was in the middle of feeding some of his cherished five-colored spirit birds. When he heard the sound of the cauldron, his eyes lit up with surprise.\u201cThe Fragrant Cloud Cauldron?\u201d He sent his divine sense out and instantly detected what was happening among the ten stone steles outside the 10,000 Medicines pavilion. His expression immediately flickered, and he stepped out into the air.Next, Elder Sun appeared, along with other Foundation Establishment cultivators. All of them had heard the sound of the cauldron, and were now proceeding in the direction of the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion, excited expressions on their faces.The last to appear was Li Qinghou, who had been in the middle of meditation. When he heard the sound of the cauldron, his face flickered, and he looked outside. Then, he transformed into a beam of colorful light that shot toward the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion.As the sound of the cauldron rang out, the crowd grew even more excited. Both the Outer Sect and Inner Sect disciples of Fragrant Cloud Peak were completely shaken, and many began to rush in the direction of the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 the sound of the precious treasure of Fragrant Cloud Peak, the Fragrant Cloud Cauldron!\u201d\u201cSomeone took ten 1st place spots at the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion! That hasn\u2019t happened for a thousand years! This is unheard-of!\u201dExcitement even broke out on Green Crest Peak and Violet Cauldron Peak. Big Fatty Zhang was hanging his head as a beautiful, alluring woman berated him. That woman was none other than the old shrew that Big Fatty Zhang had complained to Bai Xiaochun about. As soon as she heard the sound of the cauldron, her expression flickered, and she looked off into the distance. Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s face fell in shock as he did the same thing.\u201cThe sound of the Fragrant Cloud Cauldron. Could it be that some disciple on Fragrant Cloud Peak has actually gotten perfect results in all of the tests?\u201dSimilar scenes played out on Green Crest Peak, causing the Elders and the Peak Lord there to look over in astonishment.More and more people were filling the area around the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion.Bai Xiaochun was there in the crowd, and when he heard the uproar, he looked up at the ten stone steles. Although he didn\u2019t join in with the shouting, his heart was filled with an indescribable feeling. He stood there, a smile growing on his face; not a complacent smile, or a lofty smile, a smile of pure happiness.It had taken him more than a year to work this miracle. He had started from the first stone stele, then taken 1st place in all ten. However, having a bunch of 1st place spots didn\u2019t mean much to him in the end. The most important thing was that he had gained a complete mastery over plants and vegetation, as well as the spirit creatures, something that apprentice apothecaries needed to be proficient in.He had crafted an unprecedentedly deep foundation. As he thought back to the long days and endless nights he had spent obsessively studying plants and vegetation, and then spirit creatures, Bai Xiaochun sighed emotionally.In the entire Spirit Stream Sect, there weren\u2019t even any Inner Sect disciples who had such a strong foundation in their skill with plants and vegetation. Currently, Bai Xiaochun was feeling very satisfied.Soon, numerous beams of light could be seen flying through the air, all of them emanating powerful cultivation base fluctuations. Among them were Elder Zhou, Elder Sun\u2026 and of course Li Qinghou.They looked over the ten stone steles, and the little turtle in the 1st place spot, and their eyes began to shine brightly. That was especially true of Li Qinghou. That little turtle design caused him to first start in shock, then begin to laugh loudly, a strange expression on his face. He looked out over the crowd, and caught sight of Bai Xiaochun, after which a glint of praise appeared in his eyes that no one could detect.After a long moment passed, he flicked his sleeve and left, quite happy after having guessed that the little turtle belonged to none other than Bai Xiaochun.Soon, the other members of the Senior generation left. However, more and more Inner Sect disciples were showing up to stare in shock at the little turtle. After all, they had all risen up from the Outer Sect, and knew very well that only Outer Sect disciples were allowed to challenge the stone steles. They also knew how difficult of a challenge that was.\u201cAny Outer Sect disciple who can do this is definitely a Chosen\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmph. We\u2019re journeyman apothecaries, so all we care about is spirit medicines. Incredible skill with plants and vegetation is meaningless if you can\u2019t synthesize spirit medicine!\u201dSome of the Inner Sect disciples clearly admired the little turtle, and others disdained it. However, regardless of their feelings, a deep impression had been made, and in fact, most of them were actually a bit frightened.None of them had any idea how skilled this person would be at medicine synthesizing, but with such a solid foundation, once that person became a journeyman apothecary, his path would certainly be much smoother.The uproar continued until eventually Zhou Xinqi showed up. She stood there on her blue flying silk, examining the little turtle. Slowly, the crowd quieted down, and all eyes turned in her direction.The sight of the little turtle in the 1st place spot on all of the stone steles caused an unyielding gleam to appear in her eyes. In the past, this was the sort of complicated expression that she caused to appear in the eyes of others, but now, the opposite had happened.\u201cJust who are you\u2026?\u201d she murmured through clenched teeth. Although she couldn\u2019t bear to admit it, she had tried hard on numerous occasions to match the mysterious little turtle in terms of skill with plants and vegetation, but his ability was just too profound. As of this moment, she had no confidence whatsoever in being able to surpass him. By now, that little turtle was completely and utterly branded onto her heart.\u201cYou might be stronger than me with plants and vegetation, but just wait until you become a journeyman apothecary. I refuse to believe that you\u2019ll surpass me when it comes to medicine synthesizing!\u201d She took a deep breath and calmed herself down. She had already taken the test and been promoted to journeyman apothecary, so after giving the stone steles one last look, she spun and vanished off into the distance.After giving the ten stone steles one last look, Bai Xiaochun turned and left. \u201cThis is just the first stop along my path to becoming a grandmaster apothecary!\u201dThe matter of the ten stone steles caused a commotion that lasted for months. People talked about it nonstop, especially when they went to the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion and actually saw the little turtle on the stone steles.Meanwhile, Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans were combing the sect, employing all tactics possible to try to figure out who the little turtle was. That was especially true of the young man surnamed Qian, who was infuriated about the matter.The entire south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect was affected. While people were constantly discussing the little turtle, Bai Xiaochun was in his courtyard, eyes bloodshot as he controlled a tree leaf that floated in front of him.He was now studying the stage of Heaviness-in-Lightness. Actually, he had repeatedly attempted to do so throughout the past half year, but it wasn\u2019t until now that he had been able to do anything with it.Because of how things had ended at the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion, Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans were constantly searching for him. A sensation of crisis slowly built up within him, so he decided to weather things out in his residence while he worked on Heaviness-in-Lightness.\u201cLightness-in-Heaviness is about speed. Heaviness-in-Lightness\u2026 is about control methods!\u201d A thoughtful expression appeared in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes as he pondered everything he had come to understand recently.\u201cOr perhaps you could say that such control is actually an eruption of one\u2019s internal spiritual energy!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes glittered. He was now in the sixth level of Qi Condensation, and his internal spiritual energy was like a huge river. When it came to Lightness-in-Heaviness, he could sustain it indefinitely, and unleash shocking speed.He had long since come to understand that the so-called stage of Heaviness-in-Lightness was simply a way of utilizing one\u2019s internal spiritual energy. It was like how a flat leaf could be used to pull a small branch up into the air, but a rolled up leaf could hoist up a small rock. Likewise, if you cut a leaf into strips and then braided it into a rope, it would be able to lift even heavier objects.Many materials were like that; in the end, the different weights that could be lifted depended simply on how one combined the various elements.Heaviness-in-Lightness was just such a technique, and by mastering it, you could reach a new stage.Bai Xiaochun thought about the matter for a bit longer, then waved his hand, causing another leaf to fly over, which he began to experiment with. Sometimes the leaf moved quickly, at other times it moved as slowly as if a mountain were crushing onto it. However, he wasn\u2019t getting the result he wanted.After one try didn\u2019t work, he tried ten times. After ten tries didn\u2019t work, he tried a hundred times. After a hundred tries didn\u2019t work\u2026 he tried a thousand times.He eventually lost track of how many times he had tried. Soon, his courtyard was filled with fragments of leaves which had been destroyed, and he even had to go out looking for new leaves. Eventually, nearly all of the spirit plants on Fragrant Cloud Peak were devoid of leaves, until, on one particular day, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered, and he performed an incantation gesture and pointed out. The leaf in front of him was floating there gently, but when it fell to the ground it sounded like a boulder.A huge boom rang out, and the entire courtyard residence shook. It was as if that one leaf weighed hundreds of kilograms.\u201cIt worked!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were shot with blood, but his expression was one of excitement. He suddenly waved his hand, sending his little wooden sword flying out. It turned into a black streak that shot through the air with incredible speed. It was now even more incredible than before, and emanated a shrill whistling sound as it pierced through the air.Then, a boom rang out as a huge boulder was shattered to pieces.Such incredible power was no longer equivalent to the sixth level of Qi Condensation. Even someone in the seventh level of Qi Condensation would be completely shocked by what had just happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sometimes it would speed through the air rapidly, other times it would hang ponderously in the air, motionless.The wooden sword experienced a complete transformation there in the courtyard. Soon, sword qi swirled around the entire area, almost as if a huge wind had kicked up. Bai Xiaochun was even more excited than before.A moment later, he waved his right hand, and the little wooden sword flew back into his hand. The gaudy sword didn\u2019t look very remarkable, but the truth of the matter was that thanks to the threefold spirit enhancement, it was completely beyond what it had been before.\u201cIf I can master both Heaviness-in-Lightness and Lightness-in-Heaviness, then by using them together, I can perform\u2026 the only divine ability within the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art!\u201d Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, and his eyes shone with anticipation.\u201cViolet Qi Cauldron Summoning!\u201d Bai Xiaochun put the wooden sword away, then closed his eyes for a long moment. Suddenly, he lifted his right hand and pointed up into the sky. Instantly, his previously invisible internal spiritual energy suddenly appeared in a dazzling flash, the thin strands of spiritual energy rapidly forming into the outline of a cauldron.It was as if some mysterious power were guiding them, transforming them into that specific shape.Pulses of incredible pressure began to radiate out from the cauldron, spirit pressure which was even more powerful than the pressure from the flying sword.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face rapidly drained of blood as the spirit pressure within him was depleted by nearly eighty percent. At that point, the cauldron was fully formed, and was emanating an intense spirit pressure. Bai Xiaochun gestured with his fingers, sending the cauldron smashing down toward the ground.When that happened, the cauldron shattered, and vast quantities of spiritual energy scattered about.A powerful boom echoed out, and the ground for 300 meters in all directions emitted cracking sounds as fissures spread out.Thankfully, Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s protective spell formation almost instantly repaired the damage. Even still, quite a few Outer Sect disciples who were nearby heard the muffled boom, and were shocked.Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath. He had never imagined that the Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning would be so impressive. A single attack from it seemed almost unbeatable.\u201cViolet Qi Cauldron Summoning definitely deserves to be the only divine ability within the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art. No wonder it can only be unleashed after both Heaviness-in-Lightness and Lightness-in-Heaviness are completely understood.\u201d Bai Xiaochun eyes shone with a brilliant light, but almost in the same instant, he frowned. Although this divine ability was strong, it took a lot of energy out of him.Bai Xiaochun knew that the reason he had wasted only eighty percent of his spiritual power, and not more, was because it was so pure. Any other disciple who gained enlightenment of this divine ability before the eighth level of Qi Condensation would have had all of their internal spiritual energy drained. The only way to truly utilize the technique without incredible wastage was to wait until the ninth level of Qi Condensation.\u201cAccording to the description of the Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning, it can be divided into high-grade, mid-grade, and low-grade levels. The cauldron I just produced was low-grade. If I can reach the mid-grade level, I\u2019ll be able to form two cauldrons. By reaching high-grade, I can have three cauldrons, then form them together into one big cauldron!\u201d After standing there thoughtfully for a moment, Bai Xiaochun sat down cross-legged and began to perform breathing exercises. It was not until the moon hung high in the sky that he finally opened his eyes, revealing a bright spirit glow in his eyes. As of now, his cultivation base had almost fully recovered.\u201cA divine ability like this can be used as a trump card. If Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans ever mess with me, I can use it to crush them.\u201d Although Bai Xiaochun felt a little bit better, when he thought about the Inner Sect disciple named Qian, his brow furrowed.\u201cYou have to be at least in the eighth level of Qi Condensation to get into the Inner Sect\u2026.\u201d When he thought about that, Bai Xiaochun felt just as worried as before. He glanced down thoughtfully at his skin for a moment, and his eyes glittered. With that, he rose to his feet and took a few steps forward, picking up speed as he reached out with his thumb and index finger. A black light flashed as the tips of those two fingers then touched each other.Cracking sounds rang out in the air, along with an explosive aura. Bai Xiaochun looked at his two fingers in surprise for a moment before recovering his composure.\u201cThis is a killing move\u2026 that I can use to save my own life.\u201d After some more thought, he came to the conclusion that the more powerful the killing move, the better it would be for him. Now, the main thing he was worried about was the Undying Live Forever Technique.After acquiring his Undying Iron Skin, he had attempted to continue cultivating the Undying Live Forever Technique, but found that as soon as he began, he started feeling hungry again.Furthermore, the Spirit Tail Chickens on the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect were no longer an option. He had only ordinary spirit food to rely on, which he was sure wouldn\u2019t be enough to stave off his hunger.He had searched the rest of the mountain high and low for other spirit creatures to eat, but ever since the Chicken-Thieving Fiend\u2019s rise to fame, the three mountains on the south bank began to closely guard all the areas where spirit creature were raised.The anxiety on his face grew as he contemplated the problem. Even as he pondered how to solve the problem of the intense hunger, he suddenly thought back to the Age-Prolonging Longevity-Enhancing Pill.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right\u2026.\u201d he said, eyes beginning to shine brightly. Not only could that pill increase one\u2019s cultivation base, it also replenished vital energy. After acquiring his Undying Iron Skin, he realized that cultivating it actually required vital energy, which was why he got so hungry.\u201cI\u2019ve made huge strides in my skill with plants and vegetation, and although I haven\u2019t been promoted yet, I can still concoct medicine on my own. Furthermore, although the cost of some spirit medicines is very high within the sect, the actual ingredients relatively cheap.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was becoming more and more convinced that he had come up with a solution.\u201cBasically, I can just concoct my own medicine. That way, when the time comes to take the promotion test, I\u2019ll be much more confident. Also, it will be much easier to concoct a Foundation Establishment Pill in the future.\u201d Having made his decision, he set his jaw thoughtfully to ponder the matter further. The next morning at dawn, he fairly leapt to his feet.\u201cConcocting medicines requires medicine formulas, and I can get those even without being promoted to journeyman apothecary. All I have to do is head to the market at the bottom of the mountain and I\u2019ll be able to purchase whatever random medicine formulas are available.\u201d Bai Xiaochun patted his bag of holding and thought about how he hadn\u2019t really spent much money at all since arriving at Fragrant Cloud Peak. As an Outer Sect disciple, he was given a stipend of spirit stones every month, which meant he had quite a bit of savings built up.The truth was that Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t really care much about material possessions, though. He immediately flew out of his courtyard onto the path that led down the mountain.During the entire time he had been on Fragrant Cloud Peak, this was only the second time he had left the mountain to go to the markets. The first time was when he had purchased the medicinal plant he needed to trade for that medicinal pill. Almost as soon as he stepped foot off of Fragrant Cloud Peak, two people suddenly flew toward a nearby courtyard residence.\u201cElder Brother Chen, are you home?!\u201d\u201cElder Brother Chen, Bai Xiaochun left the mountain!\u201d These two people were both quite powerful, with extraordinary cultivation bases in the fourth level of Qi Condensation. They burst excitedly into the courtyard, where a burly man could be seen sitting cross-legged in meditation.The burly man was incredibly muscular, as broad-shouldered as a bear and a tough-looking as a lion, and as soon as he heard the words spoken by the two men, a bright gleam flickered in his eyes.\u201cBai Xiaochun? So, he finally left the mountain, huh?!\u201d The burly man laughed viciously, then suddenly shot to his feet. He looked as big as a mountain, and had profound energy, which came from a cultivation in the fifth level of Qi Condensation. As a result, he emanated a powerful spirit pressure.This was none other than Chen Fei, who used to work in the Supervisor\u2019s Department.These three had been friends since back in those days, and at that time had lacked for virtually nothing. Not only did they have other servants to wait on them back then, they had also been able to embezzle quite a sum of spirit stones. Of course, they had never expected to be literally pushed into the Outer Sect by Bai Xiaochun and his friends. The past two years had been hard on them, and their hatred for Bai Xiaochun had seeped deep into their bones.However, they couldn\u2019t afford to provoke Big Fatty Zhang, much less Third Fatty Hei. On the other hand, even though Bai Xiaochun seemed strong, they were of the opinion that he was actually relatively weak. Thus they had long since planned their revenge. Unfortunately for them, during that entire time, Bai Xiaochun never left the sect. And in the end, even though Chen Fei had some connections, he didn\u2019t dare to violate sect rules.Actually, his biggest connection in the sect was his older cousin, who was an Inner Sect disciple. However, his cousin didn\u2019t pay much attention to him, and had only helped him to a limited degree, even in his days as a servant.Therefore, they had been been forced to wait for two whole years for Bai Xiaochun to leave the sect. Now, the moment they had been waiting for had arrived. Chen Fei was feeling completely confident thanks to his recent breakthrough into the fifth level of Qi Condensation. After asking around, he knew the level of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation, and had also heard about him taking 1st place in the recent competition, although the news was that he had won that victory by pure chance.\u201cBack then he scared us all by tricking us into thinking he had mastered Lightness-in-Heaviness. Hmph! I can\u2019t believe he forced us into joining the Outer Sect. At long last, I\u2019m going to give vent to this anger of mine!\u201d A fierce gleam appeared in Chen Fei\u2019s eyes. His plan wasn\u2019t to kill Bai Xiaochun, just crush his bones and sever his tendons, enough to keep him bedridden for at least a year.Although the sect would surely investigate the matter afterwards, because there would be no eyewitnesses, because no death would be involved, and because Chen Fei had connections in the sect, the big matter would become a small one, and then that small matter would be easily resolved.\u201cYou can\u2019t blame us if he just doesn\u2019t measure up!\u201d Chen Fei flickered into motion, immediately heading down off the mountain, followed by his two friends. The three of them moved at top speed to a certain path they knew that Bai Xiaochun would pass on his way back from the market, and lay there in wait.The market wasn\u2019t huge, so it didn\u2019t take Bai Xiaochun long to find two random tier-1 formulas. One of them could be used to replenish spiritual energy, the other was to enrich vital energy. When it came to formulas for enriching vital energy, the high-tier versions were very expensive. However, the low-tier versions, despite being uncommon, were mostly used by mortals for health and exercise purposes.Although most cultivators wouldn\u2019t find them useful, to Bai Xiaochun, they were like precious treasures. After using his turtle-wok to perform a threefold spirit enhancement on the resulting medicinal pills, they would have completely different results.Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even spend very many of his spirit stones to get the necessary medicinal plants he would need to concoct the spirit medicines. Patting his bag of holding in happiness, he began to hum a little tune as he left the market. As he walked along the little path back to the sect, he fantasized about what it would be like to concoct the medicines, and he was very happy.However, before he had walked very far down the path, his expression suddenly flickered, and he stopped in place. After reaching the sixth level of Qi Condensation, his senses had grown much keener, and he could instantly detect the breathing of three people hiding in the nearby bushes. Their hearts were also racing as they watched him coming up the path.Seeing that Bai Xiaochun had stopped in place, Chen Fei and his two friends burst out to stand in front of him.\u201cBai Xiaochun,\u201d he said viciously, \u201cthe day has come to end our grudge!\u201d His friends wore equally ferocious grins on their faces as they spread out to flank Bai Xiaochun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He quickly scanned Chen Fei and his two friends, and after determining the level of their cultivation bases, immediately relaxed.\u201cBai Xiaochun, even if you drop to the ground and beg for mercy, it\u2019s too late. It was your idea to force us into the Outer Sect, and you\u2019re going to pay for that. I, Chen Fei, have been waiting for this day for a long, long time!\u201d Laughing loudly, Chen Fei waved his right hand, unleashing the power of the fifth level of Qi Condensation. Numerous leaves were swept up into the air as a result, making for a very impressive scene.\u201cAfter joining the Outer Sect, I spent the entire time practicing cultivation, and now I\u2019m in the fifth level of Qi Condensation. Let me tell you, Bai Xiaochun. Today you will truly understand what it means to be bullied. Your bones are going to be broken and your tendons severed!\u201dLaughing with complacent arrogance, Chen Fei performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, causing a green flying sword to appear. It was only about 15 centimeters long, but radiated a cold, ancient air.As for Chen Fei\u2019s two friends who had flanked Bai Xiaochun, they smiled viciously as they unleashed their cultivation bases and produced their own flying swords.Considering they had him surrounded, and outnumbered him three to one, they were completely confident that they could crush Bai Xiaochun. That was especially true after their own analysis led them to the conclusion that Bai Xiaochun had never fully mastered Lightness-in-Heaviness like they originally thought he had.\u201cYou would have been safe if you had never left the mountain. But here you are, outside the sect. And now you will understand the great price to be paid for the error of your ways!\u201d Chen Fei felt a little better after having vented in this way, although anger still burned within him.\u201cAren\u2019t the three of you afraid of violating sect rules by ambushing me here?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked, genuinely curious.\u201cSect rules? Hahaha! We\u2019re outside the sect right now. Plus, you don\u2019t measure up to us at all in skill. No one\u2019s going to blame us for breaking a few bones and severing some tendons. At the worst, we\u2019ll have to make some apologies, and then the whole matter will be over with.\u201d Chen Fei laughed proudly, imagining the image of Bai Xiaochun smashing into the ground. He was even preparing some good taunts to use after beating him down.However, when he noticed how calm Bai Xiaochun was acting, he suddenly realized that something wasn\u2019t right. Despite being surrounded on three sides, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression hadn\u2019t changed at all, and in fact, he seemed to find the situation somewhat odd.Looking like a master cultivator, Bai Xiaochun proudly said, \u201cOh, so that\u2019s how it is. Well in that case I feel a lot better.\u201dChen Fei\u2019s pupils constricted, and he felt even more ill at ease. However, now was not the time for pondering the situation.\u201cAttack!\u201d he barked, performing an incantation gesture to send his flying sword shooting toward Bai Xiaochun. At the same time, his two friends also performed incantation gestures and sent their flying swords into action.Three flying swords were bearing down on Bai Xiaochun, who suddenly smiled. He didn\u2019t even produce a magical item; he simply stepped backward. To the eyes of Chen Fei and his friends, Bai Xiaochun just seemed to vanish into thin air.When he reappeared, he was right next to one of the burly men in the fourth level of Qi Condensation. The man\u2019s eyes went wide, but before he could do anything, Bai Xiaochun clenched his right hand into a fist and punched out.The fist moved with incredible speed, landing on the man\u2019s neck with a boom. The man\u2019s entire body was shaken, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood as he bent over backward. It was as if some massive object had slammed into him; he immediately flipped head over heels, slamming into a nearby tree.The tree shuddered, and the man coughed up some more blood, then collapsed, unconscious.This sudden development left the man\u2019s companion staring at Bai Xiaochun in complete shock. His mind felt as if it were being struck by countless bolts of lighting. Even in his wildest dreams, he would never have imagined that Bai Xiaochun\u2026 could possibly move so fast, or unleash such astonishing power.Chen Fei\u2019s face fell, and he gasped. Without even thinking about it, he backed up, looking at Bai Xiaochun in disbelief.\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d\u201cToo weak,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, looking like a profound master, alone in the world, unable to find a worthy opponent. Sighing, he took a step forward, appearing directly in front of the other fourth level Qi Condensation cultivator.The burly man let out a maddened shout, causing cultivation base power to surge wildly, sending the flying sword slashing toward Bai Xiaochun at top speed. However, because of the Undying Live Forever Technique, and his Undying Iron Skin, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fleshly body had reached a shocking level. He easily sidestepped the sword, then once again punched out with his right fist.A boom rang out, and the man let out a miserable shriek. Blood sprayed everywhere as he was sent spinning backward. There was no tree for him to run into, so he landed about thirty meters away, his internal organs vibrating painfully. He couldn\u2019t even get back to his feet; he just lay there, seemingly struggling to hold on to life.\u201cToo weak,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, shaking his head. Then he looked back at the trembling Chen Fei.\u201cY-you\u2026 you\u2026.\u201d Chen Fei\u2019s mind was spinning, and he suddenly felt like a complete fool. He had absolutely no confidence in being able to win now; Bai Xiaochun had suddenly transformed into something like a wild beast.Two fist attacks had easily knocked out his two friends; that in itself required an incomprehensible amount of power. Subconsciously swallowing, Chen Fei backed away; he had no desire to keep fighting, and the only thing he could think about now was to flee.Before he could get very far, though, Bai Xiaochun flew forward at top speed, hand clenched into a fist which sped toward Chen Fei. Before it could land, a flashing light appeared in front of Chen Fei, and a little shield materialized, which met Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fist.The resulting boom caused Bai Xiaochun to sigh. He shivered slightly, but at the same time, the shield trembled, and it was sent spinning off to the side, its spiritual energy fading rapidly.Chen Fei was now scared out of his mind. He had spent quite a few merit points on that shield, and it should have been able to hold out for a while even against the sixth level of Qi Condensation. And yet, Bai Xiaochun had severed his connection with it in a single blow.\u201cBai Xiaochun, y-you\u2026 you push things too far!!\u201d he shrieked.\u201cHmph! Let me tell you, today you will truly understand what it means to be bullied. Your bones are going to be broken and your tendons severed!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was happier than ever to see the terror in Chen Fei\u2019s eyes. He would never give up an amazing chance like this. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t just repeat Chen Fei\u2019s words, he also unleashed his cultivation base, allowing the power of the sixth level of Qi Condensation to erupt out. A huge wind swept up, sending his hair flying about, and his energy soaring.\u201cSixth level of Qi Condensation\u2026.\u201d Chen Fei gasped, his eyes bulging and his scalp tingling in fear. He staggered backward as Bai Xiaochun closed in with another punch. This time, there was nothing he could do to block it, and the fist slammed into him.Blood sprayed out of his mouth as he flew backward, his entire body vibrating. A miserable shriek rang out. It didn\u2019t matter that he was as broad-shouldered as a bear and a tough-looking as a lion, or that he was in the fifth level of Qi Condensation. He was now going all-out to escape, heart filled with intense bitterness, rueing his decision to try to ambush Bai Xiaochun\u2026 in a place so far away from the sect.However, Bai Xiaochun was chasing after him like a wild beast, causing Chen Fei to shriek, \u201cBai Xiaochun, aren\u2019t you afraid of violating sect rules!?!?\u201dBai Xiaochun cleared his throat, then repeated Chen Fei\u2019s own words. \u201cSect rules? Hahaha! We\u2019re outside of the sect right now. Plus, you don\u2019t measure up to me at all in skill. No one\u2019s going to blame me for breaking a few bones and severing a few tendons. At the worst, I\u2019ll have to make some apologies, and then the whole matter will be over with.\u201d Then he kicked out with his foot.That kick sent Chen Fei flying up into the air, where he once again coughed up a mouthful of blood. A look of despair appeared on his face, and he screamed. However, before he could even land on the ground, Bai Xiaochun began to batter him with more punches and kicks.Chen Fei was terrified, and couldn\u2019t stop screaming. Soon, he was completely swollen from head to toe, and his screams were weakening.His bones were broken, his tendons severed, and his face ashen. He soon lay there, numb and staring at Bai Xiaochun in complete horror.Although Bai Xiaochun was pure, fair and somewhat skinny, what Chen Fei saw was a vicious beast disguised in human skin. That was even more so the case when Chen Fei realized that Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t even used any magical items. He had only relied on the terrifying strength of his own body to crush him.Off in the distance, the two burly men in the fourth level of Qi Condensation regained consciousness, and when they saw what was happening, their scalps went numb and their hearts began to pound. They immediately pretended to go unconscious again, not daring to move lest they attract the attention of Bai Xiaochun.Seeing that Chen Fei was gasping for breath, Bai Xiaochun finally lost interest. He settled his spiritual energy, then emptied their bags of holding and also took the little shield. Humming a little tune, he continued on his way down the path.As he watched Bai Xiaochun leaving, Chen Fei wanted to cry, but no tears would come. \u201cWho the hell told me that Bai Xiaochun won the Fragrant Cloud Peak competition by pure chance!?!?\u201dIf he had known all along that Bai Xiaochun was this terrifying, not even the threat of being beaten to death could have convinced him to stir up trouble.As for the other two burly men, they were scowling miserably, hearts filled with terror as Bai Xiaochun made his way off.\u201cElder Brother Chen, what do we do now\u2026? Let\u2019s just leave him alone, let bygones be bygones. I heard that\u2019s what Xu Baocai did.\u201d The two men anxiously awaited Chen Fei\u2019s response.Chen Fei\u2019s heart was filled with bitterness. After a moment of thought, he gritted his teeth.\u201cI want revenge, but can\u2019t get it myself. What should I do\u2026 I need to think\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After reaching his courtyard, he sighed.\u201cI practice Immortal cultivation to live forever. People like that who are always fighting and killing are complete lunatics.\u201dHe sat down in his courtyard, and began to organize the various items he had taken from Chen Fei and his friends. They were by no means rich, which meant that Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t actually make off with very much, although he didn\u2019t really care either way. When he was finished, he took out the medicinal plants he had just purchased and examined them carefully for a while.Although he had a profound foundation in plants and vegetation, he actually didn\u2019t have much experience dealing with the plants themselves. Now that he was able to examine these plants in person, his observations melded with the information that already existed in his mind. He even scratched the surfaces of some of the plants off to examine their internal structure.After doing some tests, a thoughtful expression appeared on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face, and he pulled out the two random formulas he had acquired. After glancing at the formula for replenishing spiritual energy, he focused on the other formula, designed for mortals who wished to strengthen their physical bodies.\u201cLongevity Incense\u2026.\u201d he murmured. This particular medicine formula didn\u2019t require the use of very many medicinal plants, only seven. Furthermore, there wasn\u2019t anything very special about the way they interacted. However, by using the techniques of mutual augmentation and suppression, it was possible to draw up the power of those seven medicinal plants, crush them into a powder, and then turn that into incense.Two of the plants were even toxic. If a cultivator consumed them, it would merely lead to two weeks of diarrhea. To mortals, however, they would be fatal.\u201cThere are many types of of spirit plants in Heaven and Earth. Some can be directly ingested, whereas others need to be concocted into pills to bring out their optimum effects. There are many which, because of their toxicity, can only be used to concoct incense.\u201d Muttering to himself, Bai Xiaochun took out the medicinal plants needed for the Longevity Incense, whereupon he began to study them in minute detail.\u201cI\u2019m still not totally confident in this,\u201d he thought. \u201cThe most important thing to think about in concocting medicine is the success rate. Even the simplest tier-1 spirit medicines still have a high rate of potential failure.\u201cI have ten sets of each medicinal plant. I can\u2019t waste them.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was a cautious person, and prefered to be confident before doing anything. That was exactly how he had been back when he had absorbed himself in memorizing all the different types of plants and vegetation, and the current situation was the same. Instead of immediately trying to concoct the medicine, he preferred to pore over the medicine formula first.Seven days passed. After fully absorbing the information from the medicine formula, he then closed his eyes and began to analyze the matter further. It was evening when he finally opened his eyes. Then, after a bit more thought, he produced the formula for the spiritual energy replenishing medicine and began to review it.Two more weeks passed. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, but by now, he felt that he completely understood all of the various medicinal plants that were part of these medicine formulas. After more thought, he rose to his feet and walked out of the courtyard.Medicine concocting required a pill furnace, but those were quite expensive, more expensive than Bai Xiaochun could afford. Thankfully, in the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, there were pill furnaces available for use by disciples in their medicine concocting, at the price of a few merit points.The Medicine Concocting Pavilion was on the east side of Fragrant Cloud Peak, not too far from where Bai Xiaochun lived. It wasn\u2019t like the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion, which was always teeming with crowds of people. The Medicine Concocting Pavilion was a relatively quiet and peaceful place. After all, even on Fragrant Cloud Peak, people who qualified to concoct medicine were relatively few in number. Of that small number, quite a few already had their own personal pill furnaces, and didn\u2019t need to come here to rent one.Bai Xiaochun paid for the right to use the Medicine Concocting Pavilion facilities for an entire month. He was given a personal workshop, complete with a protective spell formation that prevented any interference from outside while he worked.Clutching the wooden key he had been given, Bai Xiaochun quickly found workshop #13 and walked inside. It wasn\u2019t very large, and was completely empty except for the pill furnace and the flame which burned beneath it.After sitting down cross-legged, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, then examined the pill furnace closely. When he tried to manipulate the flame with some spiritual energy, he found that he could cause the flame to grow much hotter, filling the entire room with intense heat. At the same time, the pill furnace itself began to glow bright red.Drawing upon his foundation in the Violet Qi Control Art, he performed some tests, and quickly got used to the intense heat. It didn\u2019t take long before he became familiar with how to control the level of the flame. Finally, he slapped his bag of holding to produce the various types of plants and vegetation.\u201cThe Longevity Incense is too important to put first on the list to concoct. First I\u2019ll get familiar with the general concoction process, then I\u2019ll try. I\u2019ll start out with the Spirit Replenishing Pill. That\u2019s a tier-1 pill, useful for the fifth level of Qi Condensation and lower.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was now completely determined. Expression very serious, he mentally reviewed the medicine formula for the Spirit Replenishing Pill, then began to concoct.He produced the first medicinal plant, then waved his hand, causing the leaves to fall off. Eyes gleaming with concentration, he sent his internal spiritual energy out, forming a powerful yet gentle force that crushed the leaves together into nine beads of sap, which he then dropped into the pill furnace.A plopping sound could be heard, and a green mist instantly rose up within the pill furnace. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes gleamed brightly, and as soon as the mist actually appeared, his hands flew through the air as he extracted the stems and veins of the medicinal plant, which he then tossed into the furnace as well. Occasionally, he adjusted the flame, ensuring that more and more mist built up inside the furnace.None of that mist escaped outside, though. It congealed together, swirling as Bai Xiaochun pulled out the second medicinal plant. After catalyzing it briefly, the medicinal plant bloomed with flowers, the petals of which he plucked and put into the pill furnace.Time passed. Bai Xiaochun was completely focused on what he was doing as he pulled out one medicinal plant after another. Soon he was on the eighth plant, and his eyes were shining brightly as he stared at the pill furnace. As he continuously adjusted the temperature of the flame, sweat dripped down his face.Two hours later, a muffled rumbling could be heard from inside the pill furnace. Black smoke poured out, to be absorbed by the room\u2019s spell formation. Bai Xiaochun was choking and coughing, and a frown could be seen on his face as he stared at the charred slag inside of the pill furnace.\u201cFailure\u2026.\u201d he murmured. Sitting down and placing his chin on his hand, he began to think. After reviewing everything he had done, he didn\u2019t begin another batch immediately. After all, he was a cautious person, and whether it came to memorizing plants and vegetation or concocting medicine, he always wanted to do it in the most prudent way possible.He contemplated the matter for three full days. During that time, he reviewed what he remembered regarding his first attempt at least a thousand times. That helped him to identify at least fifty problematic areas. Finally, he took a deep breath, rested for a moment, and then once again heated up the furnace.The actual time it took to produce the pill wasn\u2019t very long. Four hours later, the pill furnace emitted rumbling sounds once again, and when the smoke cleared, the spoiled remnants of the pill once again became visible.At this point, his stubborn determination once again rose up. Removing the slag from the pill furnace, he examined it closely, then compared it to the information he had gleaned so far about medicine concocting. He then spent ten more days further examining the medicine formula, as well as the plants and vegetation involved. Finally, eyes bloodshot, he began to try a third time.The third batch seemed much more stable, but just in the moment when the pills were about to solidify, everything fell apart, accompanied by muffled booms. Bai Xiaochun leapt forward and stared at the slag again. After more thought, he sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes to ponder the matter further.This time, he spent nearly half a month. His time in the Medicine Concocting Pavilion was almost up. Finally, his eyes opened, and he gritted his teeth as he began a fourth batch.Eventually, his time was up, and the most recent batch was a failure.If any journeyman apothecary could observe what was happening, he would find it hard to believe. Almost any other person would have attempted at least dozens of batches of medicine within a month\u2019s time, and would have succeeded in at least some of them.Even if they only came up with one pill in the end, it would still count as a success.After all, most people viewed medicine concocting as something extremely difficult. If that weren\u2019t the case, then there would be more than a mere two master apothecaries in all of the Eastwood Continent.Even journeyman apothecaries were not very common, and most of them didn\u2019t have any hope of ever becoming master apothecaries.Of course, the real reason for that was\u2026 most people didn\u2019t have access to the resources which were needed to truly develop as a journeyman apothecary.In the end, though, if anyone worked long enough at it, their chances of eventually becoming a master apothecary would be much greater. Therefore, most people believed that the best way to increase one\u2019s success rate in medicine concocting was simply to practice a lot!And that was why most people simply pursued practice.After you got familiar enough with the process, your confidence in success would increase. Of course, simultaneously, journeyman apothecaries came to view failure as an ordinary thing. After a failure, one could just begin again, and thus slowly improve. That was especially true of the more ordinary medicinal pills. Ingredients for pills like that were not very expensive, and could be used as fuel for that hard work and practice.However, Bai Xiaochun walked a different path than others. He went much slower, and after every failure, he would spend more time analyzing why he had failed than he had in the actual concocting process.This had a lot to do with his caution. It would even be appropriate to call him scrupulous. Only a bit of that scrupulousness had come out during his time studying plants and vegetation. Now that he was making his first forray into medicine concocting, his scrupulous nature increased dramatically, becoming the most outstanding aspect.Because of that scrupulousness, he was able to identify even more problem areas than the average person would. In fact, the number of problems that other people might identify couldn\u2019t even compare. He thought and pondered the matter in ways that others wouldn\u2019t even consider, and thus identified various fishy areas.Because of his caution, even the slightest problem was something he would wish to control before he continued with any concocting. It was because of these reasons that he spent so much time thinking.The month had passed; Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hair was disheveled and his face was streaked with ash. Exhausted, he left the Medicine Concocting Pavilion and returned to his courtyard, where he sat there thinking and reviewing.\u201cThere are still nine problem areas. Once I solve those problems, I should be able to continue with the medicine concocting.\u201d Gritting his teeth, he sat there in his courtyard, eyes closed, analyzing the matter, occasionally taking a medicinal plant out to observe and study.Half a month passed before he suddenly rushed out, spent the merit points, and entered the Medicine Concocting Pavilion again.The fifth batch\u2026 was a failure!After analyzing the matter for seven more days, he found more problems, solved them, and then tried again.The sixth batch\u2026 was a failure!His eyes were bright red. He spent twenty days contemplating the matter before trying a seventh batch.Two hours into the process, no rumbling sounds could be heard. Instead, a medicinal aroma spread out, and Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face lit up. There inside the pill furnace were two green medicinal pills. The seventh batch was a success!He tried again, and the eighth batch\u2026 succeeded, producing three pills!The ninth batch\u2026 succeed, producing five pills!The tenth batch\u2026 also succeeded, However, in the end, only one pill appeared. It was not green, but rather, black. Furthermore, it emanated no medicinal aroma, but rather, different odd scent.Even as Bai Xiaochun pondered the matter curiously, the entire Medicine Concocting Pavilion was thrown into an uproar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 41: The Effectiveness of Spirit EnhancemenPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41: The Effectiveness of Spirit EnhancementThere were no rats or mice on Fragrant Cloud Peak. Such things could not exist in a cultivation location such as this, not unless they were actually spirit creatures. However, ants were a common thing on the mountain.Ants were an ordinary part of nature, and usually lived in the cracks and crevices of the boulders which could be all over the mountain. They didn\u2019t cause problems for the cultivators, and were essentially just an ordinary part of mountain life. As such, few people paid them much attention.Today, however, the disciples on duty around the Medicine Synthesizing Pavilion were shocked to find that innumerable ants were filing across the ground toward the pavilion itself.The disciples on duty gasped; there were so many ants it was impossible to determine how many they were. The sight itself was enough to make their scalps go numb. \u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 what\u2019s going on!?\u201dAt the same time, many of the disciples in the various pill-concocting workshops cried out in alarm, and the sound of exploding pill furnaces could be heard. Although the pill-concocting workshops were protected by spell formations, they were also built into the mountainside, which meant that the ants could easily get into them through the various tiny crevices that riddled the mountain.All of them were heading toward one particular workshop.That was of course the workshop occupied by Bai Xiaochun, who wore an expression of curiosity as he looked at a black medicinal pill. It was at about this time that he noticed the clamor outside, and suddenly realized that the workshop he was in happened to be filled with ants.The ants almost seemed to have gone insane, and all of them were heading directly toward him.\u201cAn ant apocalypse has struck Fragrant Cloud Peak!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shrieked, leaping to his feet. Unexpectedly, even as Bai Xiaochun leaped to his feet, so did the ants, heading directly toward the black medicinal pill he held.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s scalp was completely numb, and the first thing he could think of to do was throw the medicinal pill away. Almost as soon as it left his hand, the ants changed directions, pouncing onto it.The pill was instantly engulfed, transforming into a ball of ants, the sight of which caused the blood to drain from Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face.A moment later, the ant ball suddenly collapsed, and the ants scurried back into the cracks and crevices. No trace remained of the medicinal pill.In fact, not an ant remained in the entire Medicine Synthesizing Pavilion. The ants had come quickly, and vanished just as quickly. Of course, many of the disciples who had lost the spirit medicines they were working on felt a bit depressed at what had happened, but there was nothing they could do about it. Furthermore, the disciples on duty, having determined that no major losses had occurred, decided not to report the strange incident.Bai Xiaochun knew exactly why the ants had gone crazy, but as for everyone else, the only thing they saw was a mass of ants passing through.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart was still thumping in fear. There hadn\u2019t seemed to be anything unusual with the pill he had just concocted. However, he had been very focused on doing a perfect job, a job even better than the previous attempt. Now that he thought about it, he realized that he had actually made some adjustments to the ratios in the last Spirit Replenishing Pill batch.\u201cCould it be that the final Spirit Replenishing Pill was something extremely beneficial to ants?\u201d Bai Xiaochun shook his head as he thought about how incredible he was. Not only could he concoct shocking medicinal pills, he could concoct pills drove ants crazy.Upon leaving the workshop, he heard the depressed mutterings of the other disciples, and felt a bit guilty. Ducking his head down, he quickly hurried away.A few days passed, during which Bai Xiaochun confirmed that the incident in the Medicine Synthesizing Pavilion didn\u2019t cause any waves in the sect. Finally, he went back, paid his merit points, then selected a different workshop within which to concoct medicine.This time, he started working on the Longevity Incense.Concocting incense and concocting pills were two different things, and required the use of different techniques. Pills were consumed, whereas incense was inhaled. Of course, the final form was different too, one being a pill, the other being a stick of incense.Considering what happened last time, Bai Xiaochun was very careful in the way he went about working on the Longevity Incense. Two months passed, and after using ten batches of ingredients, he ended up with seven portions.He left feeling quite satisfied, seven portions of Longevity Incense in hand. Back in his log cabin, he performed a threefold spirit enhancement, after which the Longevity Incense changed to a deep violet color. Although the threefold spirit designs were somewhat faint, they were still visible. Furthermore, the feeling he got when looking at the incense was completely different than before.Bai Xiaochun looked thoughtfully at the Longevity Incense, and realized that he himself was also very different than he had been. Before, he didn\u2019t understand much at all about spirit medicine, but after concocting some on his own, he was much more knowledgeable. For example, he knew that any type of spirit medicine would have impurities, impurities that shouldn\u2019t be absorbed into the body, and yet were difficult to separate out. Such impurities could build up inside the body and eventually become so-called medicinal toxins.That was why many experienced members of the Inner Sect were hesitant to recommend that less experienced disciples consume medicinal pills. Theoretically speaking, much of the medicinal toxins could be expelled out of the body. However, if someone consumed too many medicinal pills and accumulated too much medicinal toxin, it could influence their future cultivation.Therefore, depending on how many impurities existed within a given spirit medicine, it would be classified as one of six different levels.\u201cLow, mid, high, superior, premium, supreme\u2026.\u201d he murmured, looking down at the Longevity Incense. If the medicine was more than ninety percent impure, it would be considered a toxic medicine, and wouldn\u2019t be classified in the hierarchy. Furthermore, such medicines would never be consumed unless absolutely necessary.If the medicine was around eighty percent impure, it would be considered low-grade, which was the most common type of spirit medicine. Sixty percent impurity was considered mid-grade, and such medicines were not common. In fact, only true master apothecaries were known to produce such medicines.Medicines which were only forty percent impure were high-grade, and were rare. As for medicines that were twenty percent impure, they were considered superior-grade, and if they were only ten percent impure, they were premium-grade. Those were medicines that usually only appeared in large auctions.Then there were the spirit medicines that had no impurities whatsoever, the legendary supreme-grade medicines.Before, he hadn\u2019t really understood what he was doing when he performed spirit enhancements on the spirit medicines. But after closely examining the Longevity Incense, he realized that it didn\u2019t make it more powerful, the way it did with magical items. Instead\u2026 it actually improved the quality of the spirit medicine!The Longevity Incense he held was now only forty percent impure, meaning that it was a superior-grade medicine!As soon as he realized this, Bai Xiaochun got very excited. Then he considered the matter a bit more, and decided to make a trip to Violet Cauldron Peak. His purpose was not to visit Big Fatty Zhang, but rather, to visit the only Spirit Enhancement Hall that existed on the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect.There, Outer Sect disciples could spend merit points to get help from the Elders in the Spirit Enhancement Hall to perform spirit enhancements. Although there was still a chance of failure, many disciples frequented the place.After looking around the Spirit Enhancement Hall, and also making some discreet inquiries, Bai Xiaochun was able to confirm that performing spirit enhancements on spirit medicine did indeed reduce the impurities and make them more effective.After returning to Fragrant Cloud Peak, Bai Xiaochun looked excitedly at the incense he had made, then finally lit one stick and took a deep breath. Almost immediately, he felt as full as if he had eaten a big meal. Furthermore, as the aura of the incense spread out within him, he felt warm and comfortable. It was as if the flame of his life force had been fueled, and was now burning a bit hotter.Continuing to inhale the incense, he went on to cultivate the Undying Live Forever Technique. As soon as the feeling of hunger hit him, he took a deep breath, and the feeling quickly faded.The seven sticks of Longevity Incense enabled Bai Xiaochun to cultivate the Undying Live Forever Technique for half a month. During that time, he could sense his Undying Iron Skin growing tougher and stronger.Feeling in very high spirits, he organized his bag of holding, then went down to the market and sold some of the things he had acquired from Chen Fei and his friends. Using the profits, he purchased ten more sets of ingredients for Longevity Incense, and then once again began to concoct medicine.Thanks to his constant caution and attention to detail, his success rate in concocting the Longevity Incense increased, rising from seventy percent to eighty, and eventually reaching one hundred percent.However, he still wasn\u2019t satisfied. Although his success rate had reached one hundred percent, the quality of the resulting spirit medicine was merely low-grade.His skill was not something that could be changed in a short period of time, leaving him with only option: use spirit enhancement to remove the impurities. When he used the Longevity Incense in cultivation, he would breathe in deeply and feel the true happiness that could be attained in Heaven and Earth.His Undying Live Forever Technique improved with each day, as did his cultivation base, which was now nearing the great circle of the sixth level of Qi Condensation.His greatest progress was with this Undying Live Forever Technique. With only a bit more work, he would be able to achieve a major success with his Undying Iron Skin. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s body was far tougher and more durable than before, and when he used the Throat Crushing Grap, his fingers were an even deeper black color than before.By that time, though, the Longevity Incense was beginning to slowly lose its effectiveness. In the end, it did virtually nothing, causing Bai Xiaochun to sigh. He was aware that if you consumed enough of any given spirit medicine, the body would eventually adapt to it, and it would lose effectiveness.If he wanted to continue his cultivation, he would need a spirit medicine that was even better than the Longevity Incense. Unfortunately, the formulas for spirit medicines like that were strictly controlled. It was impossible to purchase them at the market; they could only be acquired with merit points after being promoted to journeyman apothecary.The only other option would be to go to a larger market, but places like that were some distance away from the sect. After considering the matter, Bai Xiaochun lit up with determination.\u201cI\u2019m going to get promoted to journeyman apothecary!\u201dConsidering his experience concocting medicines, as well as his skill with plants and vegetation, it shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem to qualify for promotion. However, just to be safe, he spent the following several days buying a few more random medicine formulas. After concocting each one a few times, then analyzing his failures, he felt much more confident, and went to sign up for the journeyman apothecary promotion test.Of course, the promotion test wasn\u2019t something held for a single individual. Only when enough people had signed up would the test be held. After waiting for another month, even as he was pondering some matters regarding spirit medicines, his identity medallion inside of his bag of holding began to vibrate. When he pulled it out, an ancient voice filled his mind.\u201cTomorrow at dawn, come to the Journeyman Apothecary Hall, where the test for journeyman apothecary promotion will be held.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 42: Promotion TesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42: Promotion TestThe Journeyman Apothecary Hall was located on the south face of Fragrant Cloud Peak. It was surrounded by lush trees and vegetation, and could only be accessed by a narrow limestone path which snaked off of one of the main thoroughfares that ran up and down the mountain. Unless there was a promotion test underway, few people would walk along that path. However, when the time came for the test, it would be packed.In addition to the disciples who had come to take the test, there were also friends who had come to support the test-takers, or even people who weren\u2019t confident enough to take the test without first observing it being held a few times.From a distance, the Journeyman Apothecary Hall actually looked like a person sitting cross-legged in meditation. In front of that person was a pill furnace, beneath which was a passageway that led into a main square.Set up in that main square were twenty pill furnaces, all of which looked completely identical. Laid out next to each of the pill furnaces was a bag containing various types of plants and vegetation that could be used in medicine concocting.It was dawn, and Bai Xiaochun, worried about getting lost, had come very early. However, when he arrived, he found that there were people who had arrived even earlier than him. There were dozens of people standing around in groups of two or three, chatting quietly, and even some people who stood apart from the others alone, waiting cross-legged in meditation.Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t the type of person to sit around like an idiot meditating. After glancing around, he caught sight of Xu Baocai and walked over. When Xu Baocai saw him approaching, he clasped hands in greeting, and the two of them began to chat. It quickly became apparent that virtually nothing went on in the sect without Xu Baocai finding out about it.\u201cElder Brother Bai,\u201d he said, \u201cdid you hear that about half a year ago, Chen Fei and his friends were mysteriously beaten into bloody pulps? They\u2019ve been bed-ridden ever since, and for some reason, won\u2019t talk at all about what happened.\u201d Even as he spoke, he looked at Bai Xiaochun carefully to see his reaction.Bai Xiaochun yawned dramatically, and was just about to start boasting about what had happened when all of a sudden, a buzz of conversation rose up in the crowd. At the same time, Bai Xiaochun felt as if someone had suddenly looked in his direction. When he turned his head, he saw a young woman walking toward him.She wore the long garment of an Outer Sect disciple, but it did nothing to conceal her curvaceous figure. She had a waist as slender as a willow tree, which only served to accentuate the rest of her curves, and make her seem incredibly beautiful. She had long legs, and a perky rear end, and as she approached, people couldn\u2019t stop from staring.With her pretty face, and clear white skin that seemed so delicate it might be broken by a faint breeze, she oozed an attractiveness that could easily prove fatal to almost any man.Bai Xiaochun was a bit disgusted to hear people gulping dramatically, even Xu Baocai.Xu Baocai licked his lips, and his eyes shone with infatuation \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Elder Sister Du, Du Lingfei!\u201d he whispered excitedly. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the five hottest women on the south bank! She\u2019s the Immortal beauty of my heart\u2026. Oh my goodness, she just looked at me!!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s looking at me!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said derisively. He simply watched as Du Lingfei got closer. Suddenly, her phoenix-like eyes flickered with a murderous aura as she glared straight at Bai Xiaochun. She had long since come to admit that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s skill with plants and vegetation exceeded hers. However, she was still filled with complete and utter revulsion for him. With a slight snort, she walked off to the side.Xu Baocai stared at her in a daze, completely oblivious to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s derision. In fact, he seemed more infatuated than ever.\u201cSo Du Lingfei is going to take the test too\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought. After looking over the twenty pill furnaces, he calmed himself down and focused. \u201cAh, whatever, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not here to compete with her. This is an exam administered by the sect, not a contest. Everybody has a chance to get promoted.\u201dSoon, Chen Zi\u2019ang appeared, and when he noticed Bai Xiaochun, he hesitated for a moment, then grinned and called out a greeting. Bai Xiaochun smiled and clasped hands in response, after which Chen Zi\u2019ang sat down off to the side to wait.Eventually, even Zhao Yiduo showed up, whom Bai Xiaochun had first encountered outside the Missions Offices. Then, more and more people began to appear, and a good-sized crowd built up.Before too much time passed, the main door of the Journeyman Apothecary Hall creaked open, and an old man walked out. He had a full head of white hair, and piercing eyes, and as soon as he appeared, everyone quieted down.The old man\u2019s expression was calm as he strode forward with hands clasped behind his back. He came to a stop at the front of the square, looked around at all the Outer Sect disciples, then nodded his head and began to speak.\u201cI am surnamed Xu, and I shall preside over this test for promotion from apprentice apothecary to journeyman apothecary.\u201cThe test will consist of one portion regarding plants and vegetation, and another regarding medicine concocting. To pass the portion regarding plants and vegetation, simply walk through the passageway.\u201d Elder Xu didn\u2019t seem to want to offer any further explanations. After speaking only three sentences, he simply closed his eyes and ignored everyone.Even as Bai Xiaochun blinked in response, a long-faced young man walked out from the crowd. After clasping hands and bowing to Elder Xu, he strode toward the passageway leading under the giant pill furnace.As entered the doorway of the passageway, a beam of light appeared, which surrounded him, then vanished. A moment later, the pill furnace trembled, then let out a five muffled reverberations.Xu Baocai leaned over and whispered, \u201cFive reverberations means that his skill with plants and vegetation encompases the fifth volume\u2026.\u201d He definitely deserved his reputation of knowing about everything in the sect.Bai Xiaochun blinked again. Before coming, he\u2019d had no idea of how exactly the test would be carried out. Having heard Xu Baocai\u2019s explanation, he examined the huge stone pill furnace, and suddenly had the feeling that it must be connected to the stone steles outside the 10,000 Medicines pavilion.\u201cWhat do I do now\u2026?\u201d he thought hesitantly. \u201cZhou Xinqi\u2019s fans are still combing the mountain for me.\u201dSoon, more people approached, most of whom received five reverberations. However, one of them only received four reverberations, upon which Elder Xu flicked his sleeve, sending that disciple spinning away.\u201cElder Xu!\u201d the disciple exclaimed, face flickering. \u201cI thought volume four of plants and vegetation was the minimum requirement to be able to take the test!\u201d\u201cThe rules have changed. Now it\u2019s the fifth volume.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d The young man stared in shock, then bitterly clasped his hands and bowed. Not daring to say anything further, he left.This turn of events caused the sound of whispered conversations to swell. Xu Baocai\u2019s eyes flickered with surprise, and he suddenly produced a tiny notebook, within which he began to take notes. Bai Xiaochun looked over and saw a page filled with lines of handwriting, each character as small as the head of a fly. Apparently it was a record of all matters pertaining to the sect, large and small alike. Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but admire how seriously Xu Baocai took the whole matter.It was at this point that Zhao Yiduo stood up and entered the passageway. The reverberations echoed out six times, after which Elder Xu opened his eyes and nodded slightly. Zhao Yiduo clasped hands and then stepped out of the passageway.Chen Zi\u2019ang\u2019s eyes flickered. He and Zhao Yiduo had never gotten along, so he snorted coldly and walked into the passageway, after which six reverberations could be heard.After giving Zhao Yiduo a meaningful stare, and sat back down cross-legged off to the side.The fact that both Zhao Yiduo and Chen Zi\u2019ang had received six reverberations caused a buzz of envious conversation to rise up. At the same time, Du Lingfei\u2019s eyes flickered, and she walked through the passageway. As she did, six reverberations could be heard, which caused even more envious gleams to appear in the eyes of the onlookers.Murmured conversations instantly broke out.\u201cChen Zi\u2019ang, Zhao Yiduo, and Du Lingfei are all persons of outstanding talent within the Outer Sect. Not only have they mastered five volumes of plants and vegetation, but they also have command of the first volume of spirit creatures. I would say that they have a seventy to eighty percent chance of passing the test and being promoted to journeyman apothecary.\u201d\u201cHistorically speaking, anyone who takes the journeyman apothecary test having already mastered six stone steles will pass, as long as that disciple\u2019s performance in medicine concocting isn\u2019t lacking.\u201dEven as everyone discussed the matter, Bai Xiaochun gritted his teeth. Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do about Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans. Just as he was about to take a step forward, a figure suddenly appeared off in the distance, speeding along the mountain path. It was a middle-aged man, his hair completely disheveled, but his eyes sparkling with life. Even before he arrived, his voice echoed out to be heard by all.\u201cI, Han Jianye, having spent seven years in secluded meditation, and have finally made a huge breakthrough in my skill with plants and vegetation. Finally, I have emerged once again into the world, not just be promoted to journeyman apothecary, but to become the top journeyman apothecary in the entire test!\u201d Looking very proud and lofty, he flickered through the air toward the giant pill furnace\u2019s passageway.Elder Xu didn\u2019t pay the man any heed, not even deigning to open his eyes. However, everyone else in the crowd seemed astonished to have heard the name Han Jianye.\u201cHan Jianye? Who\u2019s that? I\u2019ve never heard of him before.\u201d\u201cConsidering how old he is, he must be an Outer Sect disciple from seven or eight years ago\u2026. He wants to be the top journeyman apothecary, which isn\u2019t a very easy thing to do.\u201dEven as everyone expressed their shock, Han Jianye stepped into the passageway, looking extremely proud and confident. Almost immediately, powerful reverberations began to echo out into the air.One reverberation, two reverberations\u2026 five, six, seven\u2026 before anyone in the crowd could even react, eight reverberations echoed out from within the pill furnace.Elder Xu\u2019s eyes snapped open, and he looked over at the middle-aged man, a broad smile of praise on his face.\u201cFive volumes of plants and vegetation, and three volumes of spirit creatures,\u201d he said. \u201cExcellent!\u201dLooking very excited, Han Jianye clasped hands and bowed to Elder Xu. Then he turned, and when he looked at Du Lingfei and the others, the pride in his eyes was very clear. Swishing his sleeves, he sat down confidently in front of the center-most of the pill furnaces.Finally, gasps could be heard from the crowd, as well as the clamor of conversation.\u201cEight reverberations! Not only did he master everything about plants and vegetation, he even got through three volumes of spirit creatures!\u201d\u201cIt seems he might be able to do exactly as he said and become the top journeyman apothecary!\u201dWhen Bai Xiaochun witnessed what happened, he was left feeling quite underwhelmed. Therefore, when everyone in the crowd started getting excited, he almost couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cHe only mastered three volumes of spirit creatures, right?\u201d he asked of Xu Baocai. \u201cWhy is everyone making such a big fuss?\u201d If he remembered correctly, when it came to the third stone stele of spirit creatures, over a thousand people were listed as having passed it. Even the tenth stone stele had been passed by hundreds of people.Xu Baocai rolled his eyes, feeling more contemptuous than ever of Bai Xiaochun. Of course, he didn\u2019t dare give voice to that contempt, and instead cleared his throat and said, \u201cElder Brother Bai, you just don\u2019t understand. To master all five volumes of plants and vegetation is hard enough as it is. The volumes of spirit creatures are even harder! Even mastering one of them is enough to make you the subject of much envy. Obviously, to master three is even more shocking. Do you think everyone can be consummate Chosen like Zhou Xinqi or the little turtle? Look, just forget about those two. On all of Fragrant Cloud Peak, there are probably less than fifty people who have passed the stone steles of all five volumes of plants and vegetation plus all five volumes of spirit creatures!\u201cEach and every one of those people are dragons and phoenixes among mortals. Think about it! There are a lot of names on those stone steles, but those name lists are thousands of years old. Plus, many of those people have already moved on to the Inner Sect, leaving only their names behind here in the Outer Sect!\u201cFurthermore, you only need to master five volumes to take this test. This guy has eight! Just as he said, he\u2019s definitely going to become the top journeyman apothecary, which will earn him the 5,000 merit point prize.\u201dAlthough Xu Baocai\u2019s words were actually a bit contemptuous if you paid close attention, Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t really notice. Eyes gleaming with elation, he looked at Xu Baocai and said, \u201cDid you just say that Zhou Xinqi and the little turtle are consummate Chosen? Are they really that awesome?\u201d\u201cOf course! Especially the little turtle. He\u2019s completely shocking. He\u2019s the first person in a thousand years to get first place in all ten stone steles. Elder Brother Bai, I have to say, you really shouldn\u2019t aim too high.\u201d Even as the contempt in Xu Baocai\u2019s heart rose to new heights, Bai Xiaochun laughed heartily. The more he was around Xu Baocai, the more he liked him. Clapping him on the shoulder, he suddenly strode forward.Xu Baocai gaped in shock as Bai Xiaochun walked toward the passageway. Of course, Bai Xiaochun was somewhat well-known for his skill with plants and vegetation, considering that he had defeated Du Lingfei. It was a given that he would eventually take this test.However, what happened next caused Xu Baocai\u2019s eyes to bulge. Xu Baocai strode proudly into the passageway, after which a flash of light could be seen, and the muffled reverberations began.One, two, three\u2026 six, seven, eight!Everyone became deathly quiet. However, the reverberations didn\u2019t stop. A ninth reverberation echoed out and then\u2026 a tenth!RUMBLE!When the tenth reverberation echoed out, Elder Xu\u2019s eyes shot open, and they glowed with unprecedented brightness. He looked over at Bai Xiaochun, completely shocked.It must be stated that it would be rare enough for one of the thousands of Outer Sect disciples on Fragrant Cloud Peak to master all ten of the volumes, including the five for plants and vegetation, and the five for spirit creatures. Virtually all of them would have already taken this test. For someone to be so patient as to wait until they had mastered all ten was something that Elder Xu had never seen, not until this very day.Even Zhou Xinqi had taken the test after having mastered only nine.Du Lingfei\u2019s eyes went wide as she stared at Bai Xiaochun standing there in the passageway. Although she had already known that he was far more advanced than her in his skill with plants and vegetation, she had never imagined that he would have reached such an astonishing level. Not only had he completely mastered plants and vegetation, he also had shocking skill with spirit creatures.Her mind was spinning, and she could do nothing but gape blankly. She couldn\u2019t help but recall how she had demanded to compete with him in skill with plants and vegetation, and how he had cautiously and even nervously asked about her ranking. Then she thought about how anxious he had looked when he had agreed to compete.As of this moment she realized that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s nervousness back then had been a front, concealing the wide smile that had blossomed in his heart.\u201cBai. Xiao. CHUN!!\u201d she thought, gnashing her teeth.Chen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo also gasped and stared at Bai Xiaochun in astonishment.As for Han Jianye, who had spent so many years in secluded meditation, he began to tremble. He was glaring at Bai Xiaochun, his mind spinning, waves of shock crashing into him as he realized that Bai Xiaochun was definitely his lifelong archenemy.\u201cThe most important part of the journeyman apothecary test is medicine concocting!\u201d he thought. \u201cHe might be strong, but I refuse to believe that he can outdo me in concocting medicine. I spent seven years in secluded meditation just to take the top spot in this test!!\u201dAt the same time, the surrounding Outer Sect disciples were gasping and even crying out in shock.\u201cThat was\u2026 ten reverberations! That means he mastered all five of the volumes of spirit creatures too! He passed all of the stone steles outside the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion! There aren\u2019t even fifty disciples in the entire Outer Sect who can do that!\u201d\u201cThis guy has incredible patience! He waited to pass all ten of the stone steles before taking the promotion test!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So Slow....Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cDon\u2019t tell me... he's the little turtle!?!?\u201d The crowd was in an uproar.Of course, most flabbergasted of everyone was Xu Baocai, who was staring at Bai Xiaochun with eyes so wide they seemed to be on the verge of popping out of his head. Moments ago, he had despised Bai Xiaochun for not thinking much of having mastered three volumes of spirit creatures, but now, he clearly had every right to have that attitude....\u201cMastery of plants and vegetation and mastery of spirit creatures.... Bai Xiaochun was clearly just messing with me!! But this is simply unbelievable. He's only been in the sect for a few years! Could it be... that he really is the little turtle?\u201d Gasping, Xu Baocai pulled out his little notebook and began to write down the new developments. Inwardly, he was rejoicing that he had chosen to smooth things out with Bai Xiaochun, and was also rejoicing that he hadn\u2019t said anything too derisive earlier.Even as everyone was giving voice to their shock, Bai Xiaochun walked out of the passageway, sighing. Actually, if there had been a way to conceal his accomplishments regarding the ten stone steles, then he would have. After all, there were still Inner Sect disciples among Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans.Unfortunately, there was nothing that could be done about it. He couldn\u2019t just give up on the promotion. Despite the fact that he had been forced to reveal the truth, when he saw how excited the crowds were, and when he heard people calling out his name, he was actually quite moved.\u201cWhat wonderful fellow disciples. Ah, if only everyone were like that!\u201d Sighing emotionally, and under the eyes of everyone in the audience, he selected a pill furnace and sat down.Elder Xu looked thoughtfully at Bai Xiaochun. A smile flickered across his face, but quickly vanished. After recovered his composure, he calmly said, \u201cThe bag in front of you has ten sets of medicinal plants, which you can use to concoct ten tier-1 spirit medicines, specifically, Inkspirit Incense!\u201cYou will be judged based on your success rate, with a minimum of two successes being the requirement to pass. Whoever has the most successes... will be awarded 5,000 merit points! You may begin immediately.\u201dThe Outer Sect disciples in the audience instantly began to buzz with excitement in response to Elder Xu\u2019s explanation.\u201cThis time the test is to concoct Inkspirit Incense!\u201d\u201cInkspirit Incense isn't the most difficult tier-1 medicine to concoct, but it\u2019s not easy.... It\u2019s not like Spirit Condensation Incense or other spirit medicines like that, which many apprentice apothecaries have experience with.\u201d\u201cHmph. They\u2019re only refining the ways to test one\u2019s qualifications in medicine concocting. Can\u2019t you see what\u2019s happening? Before, they required four volumes of plants and vegetation, now it's five. They even increased the level of difficulty of the spirit medicine to be concocted. Presumably, things will only continue to get harder in the future.\u201dAs everyone discussed the matter, the group sitting in front of the pill furnaces in the square had very serious expressions on their faces. Although some of them smiled bitterly when they heard that the test involved Inkspirit Incense, they didn't allow themselves to be distracted, but instead opened the bags and began to inspect the medicinal plants.Xu Baocai had mentioned the matter of the 5,000 merit points earlier. Now that Bai Xiaochun heard confirmation from Elder Xu, his heart was thumping. He was already running low on merit points, which he needed to get medicine formulas and medicinal plants.\u201cIf I can get those 5,000 merit points, it will save me a lot of time and effort.\u201d With those thoughts on his mind, Bai Xiaochun opened the bag, within which were the ten sets of medicinal plants, plus a jade slip, which was none other than the medicine formula for the Inkspirit Incense.He didn't immediately begin to concoct the medicine, but instead settled his qi and cleared his mind, then began to study the formula.He took his time, which was how he had grown accustomed to concocting medicine. Even the slightest question about anything needed to be analyzed completely until he felt completely confident.His initial research alone took him two hours.By that time, Du Lingfei and everyone else had already finished inspecting the plants, and were beginning to actually concoct the medicine. In fact, most of them were more than half finished with their first batch.It didn\u2019t take long before everyone except Bai Xiaochun was already in the middle of medicine concocting. Bai Xiaochun was the only one who was sitting there, looking thoughtfully at the jade slip. That sight left Xu Baocai somewhat shocked.By now, the first batches of spirit medicine were coming out. Rumbling sounds began to emanate from the pill furnaces of everyone except Bai Xiaochun. Most of them had long faces as black smoke rose up, indicating that their first batches were failures.Han Jianye, on the other hand, threw his head back and laughed loudly. His pill furnace was trembling, and a medicinal aroma began to spread out. Shockingly, a three-inch-long stick of Inkspirit Incense appeared.The surrounding Outer Sect disciples all craned their necks to look.\u201cHe succeeded with his first batch!\u201d\u201cThis Han Jianye sure has talent in medicine concocting!\u201dAn excited expression appeared on Han Jianye\u2019s face as he glanced around at the other test-takers. His gaze lingered for a moment on Bai Xiaochun, and when he realized that he was still studying the medicine formula, a look of disdain appeared in his eyes. Finally, he pulled out the second set of plants and began concocting a second batch.Du Lingfei and everyone else all had unsightly expressions on their faces, and gritted their teeth as they began to work on a second batch.Time passed. By the time the fourth hour of the test had passed, most of the group was finished with their second batch. Muffled rumbling could be heard as... not a single test-taker succeeded.It was at about this time that Bai Xiaochun put the jade slip down. His mind was now permeated with the medicine formula for Inkspirit Incense. However, just when everyone thought he was about to begin, they were stunned to see him take out one of the medicinal plants and begin to study it closely.\u201cWhat is Bai Xiaochun doing? He already studied the medicine formula for four hours! What's the point of studying the plants?\u201d\u201cI know this is a test, but does he really have to go so slow...?\u201dXu Baocai\u2019s eyes were wide with disbelief as he watched everyone else starting their third batches.The audience waited in befuddlement as the sixth hour of the test arrived. By now, eighteen of the test-takers had all consistently failed. Soon eight hours had passed, then ten. Eventually, four people succeeded in concocting the Inkspirit Incense, including Du Lingfei, Chen Zi\u2019ang, and Zhao Yiduo.The aura of the incense spread out in all directions. Han Jianye was chuckling proudly at being the first person to concoct a second stick of Inkspirit Incense. Looking around proudly, his contempt for Bai Xiaochun grew.At this point, Bai Xiaochun was studying the fourth of the medicinal plants. Occasionally he would even tear a perforation into the plant itself, which left the audience shocked. Even Elder Xu had noticed.Time flew by. Soon, twelve hours had passed. Everyone failed in their sixth batch of spirit medicine, except for Han Jianye, who was the only person to succeed.That caused quite an uproar, and even elicited a slight nod from Elder Xu.\u201cThis Han Jianye has already concocted three sticks of incense! Nobody else even has more than one!\u201d\u201cIn tests past, two successes meant you passed the test, and four successes made you a Chosen. All Han Jianye has to do is concoct one more stick to become a Chosen!\u201dAs everyone discussed the matter, a gleam of self-confidence could be seen flickering in Han Jianye\u2019s eyes as he murmured, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely concoct a fourth stick of Inkspirit Incense. I'm going to be Chosen, and I'm going to be the top journeyman apothecary!\"Swishing his sleeve in grand style, he began to work on his seventh batch.Du Lingfei\u2019s face was ashen as she gritted her teeth and began working on her own seventh batch.When the fourteenth hour arrived, Du Lingfei\u2019s eyes shone with elation as a medicinal aroma began to spread out from her pill furnace. Even as black smoke rose up from everyone else's seventh batches, she produced the only success!\u201cI've met the minimum, but mere promotion is not enough!\u201d Du Lingfei constrained her excitement, taking a deep breath as she, along with the ashen-faced Han Jianye, began work on another batch.In the sixteenth hour, more rumbling sounds could be heard as yet again... everyone met with failure.As of this moment, of the nineteen other people besides Bai Xiaochun who were taking the test, Han Jianye had three successes, Du Lingfei had two, Chen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo both had one, and everyone else... had nothing but failures.As for Bai Xiaochun, he was studying the last of the medicinal plants.\u201cThis test is so hard....\u201dThat was the thought running through the minds of the Outer Sect disciples in the audience. They could feel the anxious pressure building up. Most of the test-takers only had two sets of ingredients left. With the exception of Du Lingfei and Han Jianye, who had already met the minimum requirement, and Chen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo, who both had one success already, the other test-takers had to succeed with both sets of ingredients, otherwise they would fail completely.Those remaining disciples were now extremely nervous. Essentially, this ninth batch was the most crucial batch; if they failed, then Elder Xu wouldn't allow them to waste the ingredients set aside for the tenth batch.If that ninth batch failed, then... their test-taking effort would be a complete failure.Filled with apprehension and nervousness, everyone focused completely on their ninth batches.... Each and every step received complete and utter attention; those who had already met the minimum requirement wanted to get a better final score, and for those who hadn't met the minimum, they had to do everything they could right now to pass.Bai Xiaochun, on the other hand... was sitting there holding the final medicinal plant. Apparently, he was considering some important question about that plant, as his brow was furrowed thoughtfully. By now... few people were paying attention to him.The eighteenth hour seemed to pass very slowly. This was the moment everyone had been waiting for. Soon, rumbling sounds echoed out. As for the disciples who had not succeeded at all, they rose to their feet, faces pale, chuckling bitterly. After clasping hands to Elder Xu, they dejectedly left the square.One by one, the disciples left, until soon, only six people remained concocting medicine.Soon, rumbling sounds echoed out from the six test-takers\u2019 pill furnaces, and yet a medicinal aroma emitted from only one of those furnaces, the one belonging to Zhao Yiduo.Zhao Yiduo\u2019s hands were clenched tightly into fists, he was panting, and his eyes were completely bloodshot. He was more excited right now than he had ever been before; he had met the minimum requirements. With two successes, he passed!Some people were excited, some were depressed. Five people had failed, two of them being disciples who hadn\u2019t succeeded a single time. Sighing, they rose to their feet and left.Chen Zi\u2019ang couldn\u2019t be more on edge. He was glaring at Zhao Yiduo, heart filled with bitterness and anxiety. Then he looked with bloodshot eyes at the final set of medicinal plants.Du Lingfei frowned, then closed her eyes to think. Han Jianye felt the least pressure of all, and yet, he wasn\u2019t happy to be stuck with only three successes. He wanted to break through to become Chosen.\u201cThe last batch!\u201d People took deep breaths as they looked out at the square, and the five people left behind. Han Jianye. Du Lingfei. Zhao Yiduo. Chen Zi\u2019ang. And of course... Bai Xiaochun.Three of them had already met the minimum requirements. Chen Zi\u2019ang had one chance left to do so. As for Bai Xiaochun... people weren\u2019t even paying attention to him, and were actually beginning to wonder why he had even come. After eighteen hours, all he had done was study the medicine formula and the medicinal plants. Some people were even wondering... if he had just come to be a part of the excitement.It was with unprecedented seriousness that Du Lingfei and the others began to focus completely on their tenth and last batch of spirit medicine. As everyone looked on with fixed gazes, the twentieth hour slowly passed.Rumbling sounds could then be heard from Zhao Yiduo\u2019s pill furnace, after which black smoke rose up. He sighed. He had failed in the final batch, but at least he still met the minimum requirements.In almost the exact same instant that Zhao Yiduo failed, Chen Zi\u2019ang\u2019s pill furnace began to emit a medicinal aroma. His wasn\u2019t the only one. Medicinal aromas were also spreading out from Du Lingfei\u2019s and Han Jianye's!In that instant, all three of their faces lit up with joy as they realized that they had succeeded!\u201cI did it! Four sticks of Inkspirit Incense! I took the top spot!!\u201d Han Jianye shot to his feet and his excited laughter began to ring out in all directions. Du Lingfei sighed in relief. Although she hadn\u2019t reached the level of a Chosen, three successes was still astonishing.Chen Zi\u2019ang felt almost as if he had been resurrected from the dead, and began to laugh heartily.As of this moment, the feelings that the four of them had been suppressing for the last two hours finally erupted out.\u201cWhat a difficult test! The fact that Han Jianye could succeed four times despite this level of difficulty shows that he really is a Chosen!\u201d\u201cDu Lingfei got three successes, Chen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo both got two.... They all met the requirements to be promoted. I bet if the test wasn\u2019t so hard, they all would probably have been able to get four successes!\u201dEven as everyone began to discuss the matter, as the friends of the test-takers were cheering in support, as Elder Xu nodded approvingly at Han Jianye and was about to announce that the test was over... Bai Xiaochun moved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had focused hard on the information in the jade slip, had become completely immersed in the Dao of plants and vegetation, and had even entered a sort of trance.Nothing short of the crash of thunder and lightning would be able to break his concentration, nor did he even glance at the results of the others\u2019 concocting efforts.Of course, that attracted the attention of some in the audience, including Xu Baocai. Curious expressions could be seen on their faces as they looked over, clearly wondering why Bai Xiaochun had spent so much longer in his initial observations.\u201cThis Bai Xiaochun is just too slow. Everyone else is finished and he\u2019s just starting. Shouldn\u2019t the test be over by now?\u201d\u201cHmm. You know what, I don\u2019t think I ever heard anything about the journeyman apothecary promotion test\u2026 having a time limit\u2026.\u201d It wasn\u2019t clear who exactly said that last sentence, but when people heard it, they began to turn toward Elder Xu, blank expressions on their faces.Elder Xu hesitated for a moment, but the truth was that the journeyman apothecary promotion test really didn\u2019t have any time limit. Therefore, he continued to stand there watching Bai Xiaochun concoct medicine.Han Jianye wasn\u2019t worried at all, and was even chuckling coldly, eyes flashing with disdain. At first, he had been worried that Bai Xiaochun would be a formidable opponent, but after the way this part of the test had played out, he was convinced that there was no way Bai Xiaochun could surpass him.Du Lingfei\u2019s brow was furrowed; Bai Xiaochun rubbed her wrong no matter how she considered the matter.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s movements were blindingly fast, and his eyes glowed brightly. To him, the entire world consisted only of that pill furnace. The various medicinal plants rapidly changed form as he kneaded them into pastes, broke them down into powders, or made other preparations. Then, after putting all of the ingredients into the pill furnace, he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and pointed at the pill furnace, causing the Earthflame underneath to burn brightly.Two hours flew by, and soon a strong medicinal aroma emanated out from the pill furnace. Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, causing a four-inch-long stick of Inkspirit Incense to fly out. As soon as it landed in his palm, he examined it, and then frowned.Everyone in the audience had very serious expressions on their faces, and Elder Xu\u2019s eyes were flickering. However, just when everyone was expecting Bai Xiaochun to start his second batch, they realized that instead, he was simply\u2026 studying the incense.\u201cWhat is he doing??\u201d\u201cHe succeeded! Why hasn\u2019t he started the second batch?\u201dEveryone was looking on, stunned.As for Bai Xiaochun, he was looking at the Inkspirit Incense, feeling quite unsatisfied. Although he had indeed succeeded, he knew that based on the ingredients he had used, the incense should have been seven inches long.\u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d he thought. Then he contemplated the matter\u2026 for six hours.Just when everyone was getting to the point where they were running out of patience, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes glittered, and he produced a second set of ingredients and began to concoct. Everyone in the audience anxiously watched him work.Yet again, two hours passed. This time, the medicinal aroma was even stronger than before as a five-inch-long stick of Inkspirit Incense flew out.Du Lingfei\u2019s face flickered, and shocked expressions could be seen on the faces of both Chen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo. As for Han Jianye, his eyes flickered, but his expression remained calm. Only he knew that, inwardly, he was starting to get anxious.Of course, what made him anxious was not just that Bai Xiaochun had succeeded two times, but that\u2026 he might continue to succeed!Under the shocked gazes of all present, Bai Xiaochun flicked his sleeve, sending the third set of medicinal plant ingredients out. His third batch was now beginning, and all of the Outer Sect disciples were watching closely.Two hours passed in silence. Suddenly, the pill furnace shuddered, and a medicinal aroma even stronger than before filled the area as a six-inch-long stick of Inkspirit Incense appeared!\u201cThree times in a row! How\u2026 could this be happening!?!?\u201d\u201cHow is Bai Xiaochun doing this? Could it be that he has actually concocted Inkspirit Incense before?!\u201d Cries of astonishment could be heard because of the successive successes; people could hardly believe what they were seeing.Du Lingfei\u2019s breath came in ragged pants as she glared at Bai Xiaochun, waves of shock battering her heart. Chen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo were both gaping dully.\u201cThree in a row\u2026.\u201d Han Jianye thought, clenching his hands into fists. His eyes were now completely bloodshot. \u201cHe must already be familiar with Inkspirit Incense. Well, he got lucky with this batch, but the next batch will be a different story!\u201dJust when everyone was expecting Bai Xiaochun to start his fourth batch, he held up the six-inch-long stick of Inkspirit Incense, then frowned and rubbed his chin thoughtfully.Then everyone waited\u2026 for ten hours.If this sort of thing had happened with the first batch, everyone would have left. But after having seen Bai Xiaochun succeed three times in a row, they knew that a fourth success would push him past everyone else to the same level as Han Jianye. That was something everyone was itching to see happen.\u201cBai Xiaochun takes way too long! It\u2019s only a tier-1 spirit medicine! Why does he need so much time to think about it!?\u201dOf course, Du Lingfei and Han Jianye were the most invested of all, and were staring dead at Bai Xiaochun, completely unwilling to leave.It was at this point that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes glittered brightly. His eyebrows shot up as he waved both hands, sending plants and vegetation flying out as he began his fourth batch. Everyone was now looking on in complete excitement.Two hours later, rumbling sounds could be heard, but not the type that indicated a failure had been met. Instead, a powerful blast of medicinal aroma spread out, filling the entire area in the blink of an eye. Then, astonishingly, a seven-inch-long stick of Inkspirit Incense appeared!The fourth batch was another success!The audience went wild.\u201cFour in a row!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe something like this actually happened\u2026. Just how many times will Bai Xiaochun actually succeed!?\u201d\u201cTwo successes are the requirement to pass, and four makes you Chosen! If I remember correctly, Elder Sister Zhou Xinqi got seven successes back when she was promoted!\u201d As the crowd clamored, Du Lingfei\u2019s face turned very unsightly. Although she was aware that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s skill with plants and vegetation far surpassed her own, to see that such a vast gap existed between them in terms of medicine concocting filled her with mixed emotions.As for Han Jianye, he was grinding his teeth, and his hands were clenched tightly into balls. He was trembling, and couldn\u2019t bear to believe what he was seeing. And yet, everything was happening right in front of him, making it impossible for him to deny it.\u201cFour successes! Four successes has to be his limit. The rest will definitely be failures!\u201dEveryone in the audience was now buzzing with speculation regarding how many total successes Bai Xiaochun would achieve. But then, they realized that Bai Xiaochun was simply staring at the Inkspirit Incense.\u201cWhat is this guy doing? He\u2019s doing more studying?!\u201d Although they were a bit chagrined, the audience members weren\u2019t about to leave now. Instead, they sat there, waiting and watching, looking forward to seeing the results of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s next study session.Sixteen hours passed before Bai Xiaochun finally took a deep breath. His eyes were completely bloodshot. Although no one else realized it, the fourth batch he had just produced had come very close to failing.\u201cThis Inkspirit Incense is much, much harder than any of the other spirit medicines I\u2019ve concocted in the past.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was prudent and meticulous. After thinking back to all the other batches he had produced so far, he identified what the problem was, and after confirming that he could prevent it from happening, began a fifth batch.He was completely oblivious to any of the conversations around him; when he was concocting medicine, his level of focus exceeded imagination. It didn\u2019t matter what anybody said, he wouldn\u2019t begin to concoct unless he was absolutely confident in succeeding.Everyone in the audience had been sitting here for so long that they were completely exhausted, and were having trouble staying focused, and yet they were now all craning their necks to see what was happening.It didn\u2019t take long before more rumbling sounds could be heard, and a medicinal aroma spread out in all directions, a fragrant odor that sent shock into the hearts of everyone present.The fifth batch was a success!Han Jianye sat there dumbfounded, heart overwhelmed with bitterness. After a long moment, he simply sighed quietly.This was the moment the crowd had been waiting for. Bai Xiaochun waved his sleeve and began the sixth batch.Before long, more rumbling could be heard, and smell of incense spread out. The sixth batch was a success!Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes glittered. Not pausing for even a moment, he pulled out more medicinal plants and started his seventh batch. However, in almost the exact same instant that he started the seventh batch, an acrid odor suddenly wafted out. It was very faint, and could only be detected by Bai Xiaochun, and yet it caused his heart to begin pounding.He performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and pointed out, reducing the Earthflame temperature. After manipulating the ingredients with the greatest care, he succeeded with the seventh batch!However, this stick was only three inches long, and contained many impurities, leaving it on the verge of being low-grade, almost toxic. However, as far as the audience was concerned, that still counted as a success!At this point, the audience was completely and utterly wrapped up in what was happening. Everyone was panting in excitement, especially Xu Baocai, whose eyes glowed with disbelief.\u201cSeven successes\u2026. Heavens! Bai Xiaochun actually succeeded seven times!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just as good as Elder Sister Zhou Xinqi! I remember hearing that the only person to ever exceed eight successes was a disciple from years ago named Wang Qingshan, an Elder Brother who is now in the supreme position of being a Successor disciple!\u201d\u201cSucceeding nine times\u2026 is completely unheard-of. Nobody has ever done it!\u201dThe audience was in an uproar, but Bai Xiaochun was sitting there quietly, looking at the pill furnace. His eyes were bloodshot, and by this point, he wasn\u2019t even thinking about the test. He was immersed in thoughts of concocting medicine, and was analyzing the near failure from all angles. Next, he pulled out the ingredients and began to examine them again to try to determine the cause.\u201cThis spirit plant is called Inkfruit, and the ink elements within each one are slightly different\u2026.\u201d He held the Inkfruit in his hand and continued to observe and analyze it.Time passed, and more wry smiles could be seen on the faces of the audience as they realized what was happening. Although they were excited, Bai Xiaochun was so thoughtfully slow in medicine concocting that it could make one bristle with anger.And yet, nobody was willing to leave. The Outer Sect disciples all sat there cross-legged, some of them meditating as they waited for Bai Xiaochun. Others were so exhausted that they leaned up against nearby boulders to sleep.A strange expression could be seen on the face of Elder Xu. Coughing dryly, he sat there cross-legged, waiting.Of course, Du Lingfei and Han Jianye weren\u2019t going to leave. Although Bai Xiaochun left them physically and mentally exhausted, they had no choice but to sit there quietly.Everything was very quiet, except for the occasional snores which echoed out. And yet, people were still waiting, and watching Bai Xiaochun. Xu Baocai was among their number.Hours passed, during which some people awoke from their sleep to find Bai Xiaochun sitting there in contemplation. They couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s still studying.\u201d\u201cThe sun is rising\u2026.\u201dEventually, after more than twenty hours had passed, Bai Xiaochun suddenly looked up, and his eyes were completely bloodshot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 45: I Could Kill You, Easy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45: I Could Kill You, Easy!Bai Xiaochun was panting. By this point, he was focused to the point of tuning everything else out. He wasn\u2019t even worried about whether or not he would succeed. His eyes were bloodshot, and his mind was occupied with only one thing: how to be completely and utterly confident!Unless he was totally confident, he wouldn\u2019t start the next batch!When it came to concocting medicine, his cautious and prudent personality was fully on display.However, even after all the thought he had put into it, he still couldn\u2019t figure out how to solve the problem without first standardizing the ink elements within the Inkfruit. Although that wouldn\u2019t count as changing the medicine formula, it would be a slight adjustment to it. After a moment of thought, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered with determination.\u201cThe only way is to adjust the formula on a case-by-case basis!\u201d He quickly crushed the Inkfruit.A squishing sound could be heard as juice flowed out, although Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t send it into the pill furnace. Instead, he congealed it in the air in front of him, then began to make adjustments here and there.Most people in the audience were surprised, but didn\u2019t really understand what he was doing. Even Bai Xiaochun himself didn\u2019t really think that his actions were anything special; he just felt that this was the best course of action considering the circumstances.However, Elder Tu had opened his eyes, and a gleam of shock flickered deep therein. Although he had been a bit surprised that Bai Xiaochun had succeeded seven times in a row, what he was doing now was far more shocking.\u201cThis Bai Xiaochun is actually trying to adjust the medicine formula! Incredible! No wonder the Peak Lord told me to keep an eye on him while he was away from the mountain!\u201d Elder Tu continued to observe Bai Xiaochun silently.A moment later, Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, flushing away the extra ink elements, leaving behind a drop about the size of a fingernail. After sending it into the pill furnace, he produced the rest of the medicinal plant ingredients and then began his eighth batch!The pill furnace instantly turned bright red. This time, it didn\u2019t take two hours. After enough time passed for two incense sticks to burn, the pill furnace trembled, and a medicinal aroma spread out. The eighth batch had succeeded!Elder Tu looked at the pill furnace, and what he saw was a seven-inch-long stick of Inkspirit Incense that was black with violet specks!\u201cThat\u2019s almost mid-grade!\u201d Elder Tu thought, his eyes shining brightly.Bai Xiaochun could also tell that this stick of Inkspirit Incense was different than the others. Although he was initially confused, he suddenly realized why all of the other spirit medicines he had produced before were low-grade.\u201cThe medicine formula isn\u2019t standardized\u2026. If you adjust things based on your current needs, you can concoct\u2026 mid-grade spirit medicines or higher!\u201d Bai Xiaochun suddenly felt as if the world had been opened up to him. Feeling very excited, and before even waiting for the crowd to break out into an uproar, he started his ninth batch!Everyone was panting, and nobody was talking. They were all completely and utterly shaken. They might have been excited before, but now that they had personally witnessed Bai Xiaochun succeed eight times in a row, they were in a state of complete and utter incredulity.Not only had he surpassed Zhou Xinqi, he was now on almost the exact same level as the Successor disciple Wang Qingshan!Before everyone could recover from their shock, Bai Xiaochun rapidly went about concocting the next batch. He only used the time it takes an incense stick to burn before rumbling sounds could be heard from the pill furnace, and a powerful blast of medicinal aroma spread out. The ninth batch\u2026 was a success!\u201cThis is unheard-of!!\u201d\u201cNobody has ever succeeded nine times, and especially not with Inkspirit Incense! Bai Xiaochun spent an infuriatingly long time thinking, but\u2026 but his success rate is completely astonishing!!\u201dXu Baocai\u2019s mind was spinning, and his jaw hung wide open. Du Lingfei felt her heart being battered by waves of astonishment, and couldn\u2019t help but think back to the competition, and how Bai Xiaochun had analyzed that grafted plant.Han Jianye simply sighed bitterly. Although he was disappointed, he was no longer enraged. If Bai Xiaochun had surpassed him by a small amount, he might have continued to pursue a grudge, but now, he had to admit that he had lost\u2026.\u201cWith only one more success, Elder Brother Bai will do something nobody has ever done, not even in ancient times! He\u2026 is going to pull off a miracle!\u201d\u201cBoy was it worth it to come watch the test this time. We got stuck here for a few days, but it was definitely worth it!\u201dAs of this moment, Bai Xiaochun was the center of all attention. Everyone was panting, and their eyes gleamed with intense anticipation. Even Elder Tu felt completely shocked, and was staring with wide eyes.Finally, Bai Xiaochun moved. His eyes shone with focus as he produced the final set of ingredients. After organizing them into the order that he would use them, he began to feed them into the pill furnace, then performed a double-handed incantation gesture to stoke the Earthflame.Time passed in complete silence. The only thing the audience could hear was the beat of their own hearts as they waited for the time it takes an incense stick to burn\u2026.An intense rumbling sound could be heard from within the pill furnace. No smoke of failure poured out, and yet, neither did a medicinal aroma. Everyone was shocked.\u201cDid he fail?\u201d Xu Baocai thought, so nervous that his tongue was sticking to the roof of his mouth.Bai Xiaochun stared in shock, but then he suddenly realized what was most likely happening, and his eyes began to shine.It was at this point that everyone watching could see a scintillating light shining out from the joints and cracks in the pill furnace. Elder Tu suddenly leapt forward to peer into the pill furnace, within which was a one-inch-long stick of Inkspirit Incense that was completely violet. His eyes danced with elation.\u201cMid-grade!\u201d he said, laughing loudly. Flicking his sleeve, he collected up all of the pill furnaces and sticks of Inkspirit Incense which had been concocted.\u201cThe final round of the test is over. Bai Xiaochun, Han Jianye, Du Lingfei, Chen Zi\u2019ang, Zhao Yiduo, you five have all been promoted to journeyman apothecary! Bai Xiaochun, you take the top spot and\u2026 are awarded 5,000 merit points!\u201dThe crowd dissolved into wild commotion, the sound of which echoed out in all directions.\u201cTen successes! He got ten successes!!\u201d\u201cPlus, the final batch produced\u2026 a mid-grade product! He\u2019s only a journeyman apothecary, but can already concoct mid-grade spirit medicine!!\u201dXu Baocai, Du Lingfei, Han Jianye, and everyone else present were completely stunned.It was somewhat grudgingly that Bai Xiaochun watched the only mid-grade spirit medicine he had ever concocted be whisked away by Elder Tu. He was of a mind to give voice to his discontent, but Elder Tu seemed too imposing, and was clearly not going to return the incense.Bai Xiaochun sighed and exhaustedly left the square. As he walked through the crowd, people looked at him with excitement and admiration. Obviously, the fact that he had succeeded ten times in a row was no fluke, and was something that an ordinary disciple could never do.\u201cCongratulations on pulling off a miracle, Elder Brother Bai! This is completely unprecedented!\u201d\u201cCongratulations, Elder Brother Bai, I truly admire you!\u201d\u201cElder Brother Bai, I have some questions about plants and vegetation, do you think you could help a Junior Sister out\u2026.?\u201dBai Xiaochun blinked. He had been so engrossed in medicine concocting that he had completely tuned everything else out. After seeing what a commotion he had caused, he quickly clasped hands and bowed to the audience.At the moment, he felt nothing short of elated. Back when no one knew who the little turtle was, he had never been able to find the right opportunity to make a big debut. Now that he had, he was experiencing exactly the feeling he had hoped for.As for the female disciples who were asking for his help, Bai Xiaochun instantly nodded in agreement. Furthermore, as for all of the disciples who were calling him Elder Brother Bai, he asked them to call him Bai Xiaochun, lest people be unaware of his full name.Just as he was feeling exceptionally proud of himself, he suddenly caught sight of a young man in the crowd, glaring at him. Bai Xiaochun instantly recognized him as one of Zhou Xinqi\u2019s devoted fans. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face flickered, and he quickly extricated himself from the crowd and sped off.After hurrying all the way back to his log cabin, he realized that he was feeling a bit dizzy. Having spent days concocting medicine, he was completely drained, and instantly fell asleep on his bed.He slept for two days straight.In the afternoon of the third day, he opened his eyes, feeling completely refreshed. Then, he thought back to how he had personally concocted a mid-grade spirit medicine, and how Elder Tu had then taken it away. Sighing, he took a look at his identity medallion to confirm that 5,000 merit points had been added, and then felt a little bit better.With those merit points, he could continue to work at concocting medicine, which would also help him cultivate the Undying Live Forever Technique. Next, he made a quick trip out of his residence to retrieve seven or eight medicine formulas from the sect. After picking one for vital energy replenishment, he spent some merit points to get a large quantity of medicinal plants.The entire process went quickly, but he was jumpy with fear the entire time. Wherever he went, it seemed people recognized him, and he even noticed some of Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans, who glared at him with cold smiles, then produced jade slips to transmit messages to their cohorts.Bai Xiaochun nervously got all the medicinal plants he needed, then headed, not to his courtyard residence, but to the Medicine Concocting Pavilion. Using the remainder of his merit points, he bought an entire year\u2019s worth of time, and then holed up.\u201cI was a bit careless this time\u2026. Hmph. Just wait \u2018til I come out. I\u2019m going to make a big breakthrough in my Undying Iron Skin, and if you people mess with me\u2026. Well, if you come at me one at a time, I\u2019ll take you out. If you gang up\u2026 then I\u2019ll just call for the Peak Lord!\u201d Snorting coldly, he began to concoct medicine there in the workshop.He could well imagine how, during those two days in which he had slept, word of him being promoted to journeyman apothecary had spread. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t take long before the entire Fragrant Cloud Peak was talking about it.And of course, that was exactly what happened. Furthermore, many people were already speculating that Bai Xiaochun\u2026 was the little turtle!There were too many coincidences for there to be any other explanation. Not only had he shown amazing talent with both plants and vegetation and spirit creatures, but Bai Xiaochun had concocted a mid-grade spirit medicine. He had even passed the journeyman apothecary test with ten successes in a row.Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans immediately sprang into action, as did Du Lingfei\u2019s fans. However, none of them realized how cautious Bai Xiaochun was, so much so that he would never return to his residence, but would instead stay at the Medicine Concocting Pavilion. Then they found out that he had purchased an entire year\u2019s worth of time in one of the workshops, and they were instantly enraged.However, the Medicine Concocting Pavilion wasn\u2019t a place that they could just barge into. Furthermore, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s new status struck fear into their hearts. Although they couldn\u2019t really do anything to him, if they roughed him up to teach him a lesson, the sect wouldn\u2019t care. After all, people who provoked those above their skill level would get what they deserved.However, there was nothing to be done now, so the group which had gathered to catch Bai Xiaochun dispersed begrudgingly. However, there was one of their number, a pock-faced young man, who looked at the Medicine Concocting Pavilion with a cold smile.\u201cYou think that hiding in there will keep you safe from me? I couldn\u2019t care less that you beat up my cousin Chen Fei. However, you bullied my beloved Junior Sister Zhou, and also my most cherished Junior Sister Du. Plus, my favorite of all, Junior Sister Hou, won\u2019t stop talking about you. Bai Xiaochun, you might have talent in plants and vegetation, but killing you won\u2019t be any trouble at all for me!\u201d The young man laughed coldly. He was none other than the Inner Sect disciple surnamed Qian, Qian Dajin!Bai Xiaochun spent one carefree day after another in the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, either concocting medicines or cultivating his Undying Live Forever Technique. As the days went by, he truly did advance by leaps and bounds in the Undying Live Forever Technique.His skin became tougher and more durable, and he could move even faster than before.\u201cAnother two days, and my Undying Iron Skin will be complete!\u201d Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, and his eyes gleamed with elation.However, it was on that very night at dusk that, all of a sudden, a green beam of light shot from the Missions Offices toward the Medicine Pavilion. It completely bypassed the protective shields surrounding the pavilion, and appeared right there inside of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s workshop.Bai Xiaochun gaped in shock at the command medallion which was now hovering in front of him!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 46: Mission For The Hall Of Justice!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 46: Mission for the Hall of Justice!The command medallion was pitch black, and in the very center was the character \u201cJustice,\u201d which emanated a bleak and somber air.Even as Bai Xiaochun stared in at it shock, a cold voice echoed out into the workshop.\u201cOuter Sect disciple Bai Xiaochun. After an investigation carried out by the Hall of Justice, it has been confirmed that after being in the sect for several years, you have only accomplished a single mission, to raise a spirit plant. Because of this violation of sect rules, you must participate in a mandatory out-of-sect mission, which beings three days from now!\u201dFrom the cold and sinister nature of the voice, it seemed apparent that if Bai Xiaochun refused to comply, he would receive the strictest of punishments!\u201cThe Hall of Justice!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes bulged, and his heart began to pound. At the same time, the command medallion transformed into a black glow, and then vanished.Everything was dead quiet. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face flickered with various emotions as he pulled out his identity medallion. Sure enough, he found that a mandatory mission had been added.He had completely forgotten about the rule about a minimum number of missions required for disciples on a yearly basis. However, the abrupt arrival of the command medallion from the Hall of Justice was something that Bai Xiaochun found very odd.After a moment of thought, he left his workshop, walked out of the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, and headed toward the top of the mountain.\u201cSomething\u2019s not right here. Why do I feel like a cold wind is running down my back\u2026? Well, I\u2019ve been in the sect for years now, and have never taken the initiative to go see the Peak Lord. I might as well go pay my respects and see if I can figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was wrapped up in very important thoughts the entire way up the mountain. Eventually, he found Li Qinghou\u2019s Daoist assistant, only to discover that Li Qinghou had been out of the sect for several months.Bai Xiaochun was feeling very bitter, and very nervous. Instead of returning to the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, he went to find Xu Baocai. After all, Xu Baocai knew everything that was going on in the sect, so perhaps he would have some clue about what was going on.Xu Baocai was still an Outer Sect disciple, and lived on a different part of the mountain than Bai Xiaochun. By now it was evening, and not very many people were out and about. Soon, Bai Xiaochun had arrived outside Xu Baocai\u2019s courtyard residence.This residence was not as remote as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s, and was clustered together with seven or eight others. Now that it was dark, firelight could be seen shining out from several of the courtyards.Bai Xiaochun ducked his head down to make himself inconspicuous. Instead of knocking on the main gate, he flew over the wall, after which he caught sight of Xu Baocai bent over a little notebook, writing.\u201cXu Baocai,\u201d he whispered.Xu Baocai was startled, but once he saw who had come, he said, \u201cElder Brother Bai.\u201dA bit confused, he rose to his feet and invited Bai Xiaochun into his room.\u201cElder Brother Bai, weren\u2019t you in secluded meditation in the Medicine Concocting Pavilion?\u201d he asked curiously. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d\u201cXu Baocai, what do you know about the Hall of Justice?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked immediately.Seeing the grim expression on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face, Xu Baocai could tell that something was wrong, and quickly responded, \u201cThe Hall of Justice? Well, there\u2019s a southern Hall and a northern Hall, who administer the two different parts of the sect. They oversee the Outer Sect disciples and servants, but usually don\u2019t do anything unless there\u2019s been a serious violation of sect rules.\u201cIf a violation does occur, they have a lot of power. There are all sorts of punishments they can enforce. In fact, they even have the power to execute traitors. Essentially, the Hall of Justice is like a sword hanging over the necks of the Outer Sect disciples, ensuring that none of us ever dare to violate sect rules.\u201cIf someone does, and gets noticed by the Hall of Justice, they\u2019ll receive swift and severe punishment\u2026.\u201cOf course, although the Hall of Justice has a lot of power, that power is limited. As long as you don\u2019t violate sect rules, then you don\u2019t really have to worry about them at all.\u201d As usual, Xu Baocai went on to give a very detailed description of the Hall of Justice to Bai Xiaochun, based on everything that he knew.He even went on to tell Bai Xiaochun the grisly fates of some of the disciples who had run afoul of the Hall of Justice.\u201cFive hundred years ago, a traitor rose up within the Spirit Stream Sect. The Hall of Justice tracked him down for seven days before finally killing him and wiping out his soul!\u201cThree hundred years ago, an Outer Sect disciple flagrantly violated sect rules. Although the Hall of Justice gave him a chance to repent, he ignored it. In the end, the Hall of Justice reported the matter to the sect, and the disciple was punished in the Blackwind Abyss, where to this very day, he is constantly scourged by biting winds.\u201cA hundred years ago, the Mount Zhou Society planned an armed rebellion. Despite warnings from the Hall of Justice, they refused to back down. When they finally made their move, the Hall of Justice executed all the cultivators from the Mount Zhou Society, sparing only the mortals.\u201dAs Bai Xiaochun listened to all of this, his expression grew more unsightly than ever, and his heart began to pound.\u201cAre you telling me that normally the Hall of Justice gives a warning first, and resorts to serious punishment only if you don\u2019t repent?\u201d\u201cYeah, exactly. That\u2019s one of the limitations placed upon the Hall of Justice. Otherwise, they would have far too much power.\u201d By this point, Xu Baocai had guessed that the Hall of Justice must have set their eyes on Bai Xiaochun. However, matters pertaining to the Hall of Justice were sensitive, and Xu Baocai was intelligent enough to look out for his own interests. Therefore, although he told Bai Xiaochun what he knew, he didn\u2019t dare to get any more involved than that.In the end, just before Bai Xiaochun was about to leave, Xu Baocai hesitated for a moment as he thought about Bai Xiaochun\u2019s skill with plants and vegetation, and then suddenly lowered his voice and asked, \u201cElder Brother Bai, do you happen to know an Inner Sect disciple from Green Crest Peak named\u2026 Qian Dajin? He\u2019s Chen Fei\u2019s older cousin, and he also happens to be a member of the Hall of Justice.\u201dAfter the time it takes an incense stick to burn, Bai Xiaochun left. As he walked along the path in the sect, he looked up at the moon and thought about everything Xu Baocai had said, which only served to confirm what he had already surmised. In the end, he sighed.\u201cI didn\u2019t offend anyone in the sect!\u201d he thought, clenching his jaw. \u201cOther than Chen Fei, there\u2019s only the fans of Zhou Xinqi\u2026. Qian Dajin. Qian Dajin!\u201d After returning to the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, he sat down cross-legged in the workshop and looked at the pill furnace. Then his face twitched.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that me failing to complete a sect mission every year is just an excuse. Something like that wouldn\u2019t be noticed unless someone specifically looked into it, and even still, it isn\u2019t a very big deal. Besides, I couldn\u2019t possibly be the only person in the sect who has done that. Since Qian Dajin is a member of the Hall of Justice, he\u2019s using his public office to avenge private grudges!\u201d After more thought, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were growing increasingly bloodshot.\u201cIf I go on this mission, he\u2019ll definitely make sure something happens to me at some point. Why else would he go through all the trouble of setting this up? However, he would still have to be careful to make sure the sect doesn\u2019t find out. Overall, I still have the initiative.\u201cIf I ignore the mission order, then I would be falling right into his hands. He would be able to take control of the initiative, using his status in the Hall of Justice to directly punish me!\u201dBai Xiaochun thought about it from many directions, but there was no perfect solution. Eventually, he took out his identity medallion and examined the mission. It only took a moment before he realized there was a familiar name in the mission description.\u201cHou Yunfei?\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes went wide as he thought back to when he had first become an Outer Sect disciple, and the detailed introduction to the sect Hou Yunfei had given him. Then, he closed his eyes to think more. 1This mission didn\u2019t seem to be a difficult one. A few years ago, Hou Yunfei had accepted a mission outside of the sect, and would check back in every month with news. That was a common arrangement for disciples who took on long-term missions.However, two months ago, contact was lost, and no news had come back.Therefore, this new mission had been handed down. Three Outer Sect disciples would be sent to investigate, with no specific instructions regarding the clues they were to gather.Search missions like this were common within the sect. All the disciples had to do was investigate a bit, turn up some clues, and then come back to the sect to let someone follow up further.Furthermore, for an Outer Sect disciple to go missing wasn\u2019t a very important matter as far as the sect was concerned. Of course they were still disciples, so the matter had to be handled eventually.That was why missions like this existed in the first place.Bai Xiaochun thought about it further, and after weighing all the options and facts, clenched his teeth.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll take the mission.\u201d Panting, eyes bloodshot, he immediately began to concoct more medicine. If he was going to go out of the sect on a mission, then he needed to have a major breakthrough with his Undying Iron Skin.Two days later, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s body was shaking, and his skin was vibrating. Suddenly, a wave of blackness spread out across him, which quickly vanished. However, if you looked closely, you could just barely see red streaks of light flashing across him.\u201cThe black is iron, the red is bronze!\u201dWhen he pushed down on his skin, a sound like ringing metal echoed out. Next, he shot to his feet and confirmed that he was much faster than before.After a few more tests, he leaped up into the air and pinched his thumb and index finger together. There were no cracking sounds this time, but rather muffled booms. They weren\u2019t very loud, and yet Bai Xiaochun could tell that this move of his was at least twice as powerful as before.\u201cBreakthrough with my Undying Iron Skin!\u201d he thought excitedly. As of this moment, he was a bit more confident regarding the mission.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad I can only concoct tier-1 spirit medicine appropriate for the fifth level of Qi Condensation and lower.\u201d Bai Xiaochun stood there in the workshop feeling a bit disappointed. However, time was limited, and he simply couldn\u2019t produce the type of tier-2 spirit medicine appropriate for the eighth level of Qi Condensation and lower.Because of that, his cultivation base couldn\u2019t progress very much, and remained in the great circle of the sixth level of Qi Condensation.\u201cTomorrow at dawn I leave the sect\u2026.\u201d he thought anxiously. This would be his first time truly leaving the sect since he had joined, and he didn\u2019t feel safe at all. In fact, he even took out the shield he had acquired from Chen Fei and performed a threefold spirit enhancement on it. That didn\u2019t leave him feeling very safe, though. Next, he performed spirit enhancements on the leather clothing he had worn in the competition.After more thought, he went out in the middle of the night and found Big Fatty Zhang, to borrow his big black wok that supposedly had an Earthflame spell formation built into it. Even still, he didn\u2019t feel at ease. However, there was nothing more to be done. Looking very anxious, he returned, not to the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, but his courtyard, where he waited for the sun to rise.\u201cQian Dajin, you just wait until I get to Foundation Establishment. Then I\u2019ll show you a thing or two!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was more nervous than ever, and his eyes were completely bloodshot. He was scared of dying, after all, and now that he was no longer a newcomer to the sect, he was well aware of how the cultivation world worked.For the entire night, his imagination went wild as he thought about all the bad things that could happen, until eventually\u2026 the sun rose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 47: Xiaochun Ventures Out Of The SecPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 47: Xiaochun Ventures Out of the SectAt dawn, when the first ray of sunlight poked out into the sky, Bai Xiaochun felt his identity medallion vibrating. He stood there at the front of his courtyard, looked back at what had been his home for the past two years, and let out a long sigh.\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to need to be very careful. I absolutely must not lose my poor little life\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun had a very anxious look on his face. He had eight layers of leather clothing on, and was wearing Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s huge black wok on his back. Although he was actually relatively skinny, having dressed up in this fashion made him look almost spherical.With a very serious look, Bai Xiaochun left Fragrant Cloud Peak and headed toward the main gate that marked the border of the south bank. On the way, the numerous disciples who looked at him all stared in shock at his unusual getup.He scowled miserably the entire time, and whenever he ran into people he knew, he would simply wave goodbye to them. Soon he was approaching the main gate, whereupon he saw two people who had arrived ahead of him. One of them was a young man sitting cross-legged in meditation. The other was a young woman who was pacing back and forth in front of the gate, but who currently had her back to him, and yet looked familiar.\u201cDu Lingfei?\u201d he thought, a look of shock appearing on his face.It was at this point that Du Lingfei also caught sight of him, and her jaw dropped. Then she noticed what he was wearing, and her brow furrowed.\u201cYou\u2019re the last person in the team going to investigate Elder Brother Hou\u2019s whereabouts?\u201d she asked.\u201cYeah, what a coincidence\u2026.\u201d he replied with a dry cough. Then he looked from Du Lingfei over toward the young man. Although his face was expressionless, a murderous aura rippled off of him, and as soon as Bai Xiaochun looked over at him, he opened his eyes and looked back, an enigmatic half-smile on his face.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart twitched. After analyzing the matter, he had come to the conclusion that the easiest way for Qian Dajin to do something to him was to place a friend within the mission group. Then, after they all left the sect, that friend could strike at him secretly.At the moment, he found both Du Lingfei and this young man to be worthy of suspicion. And yet, he acted completely at ease, and even smiled widely at the young man.\u201cBai Xiaochun at your service,\u201d he said. \u201cElder Brother, you are\u2026?\u201dThe young man smiled back and replied, \u201cFeng Yan of Green Crest Peak.\u201dBai Xiaochun quickly clasped hands in respect. \u201cOh, Elder Brother Feng, I should have known it was you. At first glance you\u2019re obviously an extraordinary individual. This is my first mission outside of the sect, so I really hope you can show me how it\u2019s done, Elder Brother Feng.\u201d It only took a moment for Bai Xiaochun to assess that Feng Yan\u2019s cultivation base was at the seventh level of Qi Condensation.\u201cNo problem. You flatter me.\u201d A flicker of scorn passed through Feng Yan\u2019s eyes. The only reason he\u2019d agreed to take the mission was that Inner Sect disciple Qian Dajin had promised him a lucrative reward to secretly kill Bai Xiaochun.As far as he was concerned, that wouldn\u2019t be difficult at all. All he had to do was be careful and make it look like an accident; Bai Xiaochun was as good as dead.The only thing he had to be careful about was to make sure that Du Lingfei didn\u2019t see. Of course, he was mostly convinced that Du Lingfei had taken the mission for the same reason he had, because of Qian Dajin.As for Du Lingfei, she was currently frowning. She had never imagined that accepting a mission outside the sect would result in her being stuck with one of the people she despised the most. After all, no one had forced her to take this mission; she had selected it on her own. Although there might be some danger associated with it, it was a relatively simple mission with a hefty reward of merit points.She had been stuck in the great circle of the fifth level of Qi Condensation for some time now, and needed some Cloudsoaring Incense to break through, which of course required merit points. As soon as she thought about Cloudsoaring Incense, her revulsion for Bai Xiaochun stirred.\u201cThe lily-livered rat!\u201d she thought, glaring at Bai Xiaochun in disgust. She especially despised his sphere-like appearance with all the clothes and the black wok, which made it more obvious than ever that he feared death.Snorting coldly, she completely ignored Bai Xiaochun and turned toward Feng Yan to clasp hands and bow.\u201cElder Brother Feng, now that we\u2019re all here, please produce the Windskiff. The sooner we get this mission done, the sooner we can come back.\u201dFeng Yan gave a slight smile, then slapped his bag of holding, causing a white beam of light to fly out. A blast of wind could be felt as the beam transformed into a small white ship, about six meters long.Fluctuations of spiritual power emanated off of the ship, transforming into an extraordinary pressure.Bai Xiaochun looked it over and immediately blurted, \u201cElder Brother Feng, what\u2019s that?\u201dThis was his first time seeing anything like this. As the ship hovered there in midair, it was obvious that it was some type of vehicle. Even as Du Lingfei\u2019s eyes flickered with scorn, Feng Yan smiled.\u201cThis is a Windskiff. When missions require us to go some distance away from the sect, we can rent ships like this from the sect to make things easier. We can save some of our own spiritual power, at the cost of some spirit stones.\u201d With that, he leaped up into the air and settled down into the ship.Du Lingfei quickly followed, as did Bai Xiaochun. The ship wasn\u2019t very big, and was somewhat cramped, but there was still plenty of room for the three of them. Bai Xiaochun sat down in the very back and began to study ship even more closely. The more he looked at it, the more he realized that it truly was an incredible item.\u201cOne of these days,\u201d he murmured, \u201cI\u2019m going to get one of these for myself.\u201dSeeing Bai Xiaochun looking like a complete country bumpkin, Du Lingfei couldn\u2019t hold back from sarcastically remarking, \u201cEven if you sold yourself into slavery you couldn\u2019t afford one!\u201dBai Xiaochun looked over at Du Lingfei, measured her up, then nodded.\u201cTrue. But if I sold you, I could definitely afford one.\u201d\u201cYOU!\u201d Du Lingfei\u2019s phoenix-like eyes went wide, and she was just about to say something more when Feng Yan sent the Windskiff flying off into the distance in a beam of prismatic light.As they sped along at top speed, whistling through the air, a shield sprang up around the ship, creating a barrier against the wind. Although they could hear the wind buffeting the shield, the inside of the ship was very calm.Meanwhile, back on Fragrant Cloud Peak, in the Journeyman Apothecary Hall, Elder Xu, who had been in charge of the promotion test, was looking at a jade slip and frowning slightly.\u201cThe Hall of Justice circumvented Fragrant Cloud Peak to force Bai Xiaochun into accepting an outside mission?\u201d After examining the jade slip a bit further, his frown faded away. After examining the details of the mission, he realized that although there might be some danger involved, it was nothing deadly.Then he thought about what Li Qinghou had mentioned about Bai Xiaochun\u2019s personality. \u201cIf the kid\u2019s a bit lazy, then some punishment isn\u2019t uncalled for.\u201dFinally, he put the jade slip down and continued to concoct medicine.At the same time, Qian Dajin stood outside his Immortal\u2019s cave in the Inner Sect, watching the ship flying off into the distance, and a cold smile appeared on his face.\u201cWith Feng Yan\u2019s cultivation base, secretly killing Bai Xiaochun should be as easy as flipping over his hand. Bai Xiaochun\u2026 you might have exceptional skill with plants and vegetation, but unfortunately, you\u2019ll never have a chance to do anything with it. You\u2019re dead!\u201d A sinister gleam appeared deep within Qian Dajin\u2019s eyes. Smiling, he turned and headed back into his Immortal\u2019s cave.The azure sky stretched out in all directions. Bai Xiaochun sat there on the ship, feeling somewhat nervous, but at the same time looking out excitedly as the scenery changed.Off in the distance he saw numerous mountain peaks that looked like swords sticking up into the sky, part of a mountain range that looked like a slumbering dragon. There was also\u2026 a massive, shocking river!\u201cThe Heavenspan River\u2026.\u201d he said, taking a deep breath. After becoming an Outer Sect disciple, had done a lot of research, and had learned that the entire cultivation world relied on the Heavenspan River.It was actually the source of all spiritual energy.That was why all of the sects were located in areas near it. Furthermore, the further you went into the Upper Reaches of the river, the stronger the spiritual energy was.Although the Spirit Stream Sect was technically in the Middle Reaches, even that position had allowed them to stand strong and tall for ten thousand years. According to what Bai Xiaochun had read, the Spirit Stream Sect hadn\u2019t always existed in its current position. It had previously been located in the Lower Reaches. But then an extraordinary Patriarch had appeared among the countless sects and cultivator clans there. After distinguishing himself in intense fighting, he gained the approval of a higher ranking sect, and thus earned the qualifications to establish his own sect in the Middle Reaches.\u201cSupposedly, the sects in the Upper Reaches of the Heavenspan River are so powerful that the Spirit Stream Sect can\u2019t even compare to them. Furthermore, according to the legends\u2026 there are even more terrifying sects at the source of the river.\u201d Bai Xiaochun forced himself to calm down, and reminded himself that he needed to be extra careful in this mission.Off in the distance, the Heavenspan River looked golden, almost like a huge churning sea. Furthermore, hugging the river were four towering mountain peaks.\u201cThat must be the north bank of the Spirit Stream Sect,\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought. Also visible was the main peak of the Spirit Stream Sect, which arched over the Heavenspan River like a huge bridge!\u201cMount Daoseed!\u201d Bai Xiaochun had actually seen all of this when Li Qinghou had first brought him to the Spirit Stream Sect. However, at that time he had been a mere mortal. Now that he was an Outer Sect disciple, he got a completely different feeling when looking at it.The ship shot away from the sect at top speed, following the rippling water beneath as they headed toward the Lower Reaches.\u201cJunior Sister Du, Junior Brother Bai, I presume both of you have already examined the details of the mission,\u201d Feng Yan said coolly, his voice so light that it was almost hard to hear. \u201cWe\u2019re heading to an area in the Lower Reaches of the Heavenspan River called the Fallenstar Mountains. Junior Brother Hou\u2019s last message came from that area. The Fallenstar Mountains mark the boundary of the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s sphere of influence. The rest of the mountains count as the territory of the Blood Stream Sect.\u201cWe might find ourselves in some danger on this mission. However, by preparing ourselves mentally, and also being as cautious as possible, we will likely avoid any major problems.\u201cHowever, our final destination is quite a distance away, and will take quite a few spirit stones to get there. Most of our time on this mission will be spent traveling, but with our Windskiff, we will be able to bypass some of the more difficult terrain.\u201d With that, a cold gleam flickered in his eyes before he closed them in meditation.Du Lingfei ignored Bai Xiaochun and began to perform breathing exercises.Bai Xiaochun felt more vigilant than ever. Despite also sitting cross-legged and closing his eyes, he was really pondering which among these two had been sent by Qian Dajin.\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely to be Du Lingfei,\u201d he thought. \u201cWhich means\u2026 there\u2019s an eighty to ninety percent chance that its Feng Yan!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Soon, darkness blanketed the lands.At the foot of the mountain, the dense jungle echoed with the roars of animals and wild beasts. The air was very humid.\u201cAfter we get past this jungle, we can rest,\u201d Feng Yan said coolly. \u201cWhat do you two think?\u201d He looked at Du Lingfei and Bai Xiaochun.\u201cIt\u2019s dark,\u201d Bai Xiaochun pointed out. \u201cThat jungle might have some dangerous wild beasts in it; why don\u2019t we just fly over it with the Windskiff?\u201d\u201cTake a break on your own, if you want,\u201d Du Lingfei said with a cold snort. \u201cIt\u2019s just some trees.\u201d Not concealing her disdain for Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fear of death, she flashed into motion, heading directly toward the jungle.A glimmer of scorn stirred deep in Feng Yan\u2019s eyes, but he smiled nonetheless and then shot down the mountain.Bai Xiaochun frowned as he watched the two of them leaving. Finally he sighed, and followed them down the mountain toward the jungle, more vigilant than ever.The humidity increased when they entered the jungle, and there were even some spots which were marshes or bogs. Animals appeared occasionally, but these were three Qi Condensation cultivators. They didn\u2019t slow down at all as they proceeded along, gradually forging their way deeper and deeper into the jungle.Time passed. Eventually, the night deepened. By the time the moon rose, they were already about halfway to the others side. So far they hadn\u2019t encountered any fierce beasts. The trip had gone very smoothly. Bai Xiaochun was in the rear position, and even the slightest sound or movement would cause him to leap in fright. Du Lingfei\u2019s scorn grew stronger.\u201cWatch out!\u201d Bai Xiaochun suddenly blurted, stopping in place with a very uneasy expression on his face.Du Lingfei laughed coldly, and was just about to say something sarcastic when all of a sudden, a wild wind blasted toward them, along with an acrid odor. Du Lingfei\u2019s face flickered, and she looked out into the jungle to see countless eyes staring back.They were bright red, and in almost the exact same instant that she saw them, the sound of flapping wings could be heard. Numerous bats appeared, each one about the size of a hand, flying in their direction.\u201cTwo-headed Bats!\u201d exclaimed Feng Yan. \u201cTheir venom dries up the blood and seals the throat! Split up and meet at the mountain peak on the other side of the jungle.\u201d Face flickering, Feng Yan burst into motion, heading off at top speed.Du Lingfei\u2019s pupils constricted, and she waved her hand in front of her, throwing out a paper talisman. As it burned, a blue light spread out, covering her with a shield and also increasing her speed. She picked another direction and sped off. Looking over her shoulder as she left, she was shocked to find that Bai Xiaochun had long since disappeared.Bai Xiaochun had begun fleeing as soon as the wind kicked up. Of course, Bai Xiaochun was very careful and perceptive, and was extremely attuned to danger.Even as he fled, the bats approached, causing a droning sound to fill the air. They quickly split up into three groups, which began to pursue the three disciples.A cold smile appeared on Feng Yan\u2019s face as he sped through the jungle, and he quickly put away the stick of incense that he had just been holding. That stick of incense was what had attracted the bats, and was also why had had chosen to pass through this jungle on the way to their mission. He had sensed that this would be a likely location to contain Two-headed Bats.\u201cThe weakest of them are at the third level of Qi Condensation. Bai Xiaochun, don\u2019t blame me that someone wants you dead.\u201d Laughing coldly, he slapped his bag of holding to produce a wooden stick. After blowing a breath of air onto the stick, it ignited with black flames that caused the bats to let out piercing shrieks. Apparently, they hated those flames, and thus instantly dispersed.Feng Yan smiled and then continued onward, feeling much more at ease.As for Bai Xiaochun, he was speeding along through the jungle being pursued by numerous bats. However, the bats couldn\u2019t match his speed, and before long, there was quite a distance between the two of them. Occasionally, a beam of sword light would flash out, and a bat would scream and fall out of the air.Bai Xiaochun ran along, and after enough time had passed for an incense stick to burn, he looked over his shoulder and frowned.\u201cIt sure was strange for all those bats to suddenly show up,\u201d he thought. He walked back a bit and found one of the bats he had killed with a flying sword, and after examining it closely, his eyes gleamed.\u201cThese aren\u2019t Two-headed Bats, they\u2019re Violetvein Bats! They\u2019re just as venomous, but they\u2019re different from Two-headed Bats in that their fangs are the main ingredient for the tier-2 spirit medicine Bloodburning Incense!\u201cBack in the sect, you can sell fangs like this for fifty merit points apiece.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was immediately delighted. Not very many people would recognize that these bats were actually listed in the fifth volume of spirit creatures.Feeling very excited, he began to collect the corpses of the bats. It didn\u2019t take long before he had ten bats, from which he began to extract the fangs.\u201cThese bats aren\u2019t that strong after all\u2026.\u201d he said, chuckling. Soon, a shield sprang up around him, and he began to search through the jungle. Before long, an entire group of Violetvein Bats was flying toward him.He quickly performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, sending a flying sword bursting out toward the bats. Its speed was incredible, and before they could even get close to him, miserable shrieks filled the air, and numerous bats began to fall to the ground. The few that made it past the sword slammed into his shield and were sent spinning away.Bai Xiaochun collected the dead bats. Realizing that he was actually in no danger, he felt more at ease than ever. Puffing his chest out proudly, he continued to search through the jungle.It was in that fashion that he made his way along, collecting more and more fangs\u2026.Four hours later, Feng Yan made his way out of the jungle to the appointed meeting spot on the mountain peak. There, he sat down cross-legged, a slight smile on his face as he waited.Another two hours passed, and Du Lingfei shot out from the trees, looking very bedraggled. As she sped up the mountain, she looked back anxiously at the dark jungle. Eventually, she reached Feng Yan, and realized that Bai Xiaochun was nowhere to be seen.\u201cBai Xiaochun hasn\u2019t come out yet?\u201d she asked.Feng Yan sighed and shook his head. \u201cI wish Junior Brother Bai all the best. Unfortunately, Two-headed Bats are most active at night. If we go back in looking for him, we would be in a lot of danger.\u201d In order to make things look even more realistic, he didn\u2019t rest, but instead craned his neck anxiously toward the jungle, as if he were waiting for Bai Xiaochun to appear.Du Lingfei maintained her silence. Although she hated Bai Xiaochun, she didn\u2019t hate him so much that she wished him dead. After all, they were fellow members of the same sect. Finally, she sat down cross-legged and looked down at the jungle, sighing.Time passed, and soon it was almost dawn.After waiting through the entire night without seeing Bai Xiaochun, Du Lingfei was getting a very uneasy feeling.Feng Yan rose to his feet. After having stayed up the entire night, his eyes were bloodshot as he looked dejectedly toward the jungle. \u201cIf he hasn\u2019t appeared by now, I\u2019m afraid it means that Bai Xiaochun\u2026 has met with disaster. It\u2019s all my fault. If I hadn\u2019t suggested to go through the jungle, Junior Brother Bai wouldn\u2019t have\u2026 ai.\u201d\u201cElder Brother Feng, don\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d Du Lingfei said. \u201cWho would ever have thought that there would be Two-headed Bats in this place? Maybe Bai Xiaochun isn\u2019t dead yet. Besides, if he is dead, then as fellow disciples, we should go retrieve his corpse!\u201d She was unsure of exactly what sort of emotions she was experiencing, which was a very strange sensation. Although Bai Xiaochun annoyed her, she somehow felt disturbed. After all, there was no deep grudge between the two of them.Feng Yan sighed and nodded seriously. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Junior Sister Du. No matter what has happened, we can\u2019t give up on him.\u201dWith that, the two of them prepared to head back down the mountain to begin the search.However, it was only a moment later that they caught sight of Bai Xiaochun strolling out from within the trees, yawning. As soon as he was out of the jungle itself, he stretched lazily.Du Lingfei\u2019s eyes went wide, and Feng Yan almost couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing as Bai Xiaochun casually began to walk up the mountain path.He almost looked like he had just woken up from a good night\u2019s sleep. He seemed excited and energetic, as opposed to Feng Yan and Du Lingfei, who were weary from a night without rest.Soon, Bai Xiaochun was at the top of the mountain. When he caught sight of Feng Yan and Du Lingfei, he hurried over and called out, \u201cGood morning! Elder Brother Feng, Elder Sister Du, that jungle is way too scary! I almost lost my little life.\u201dBai Xiaochun truly had rested well that night. After clearing the entire jungle of bats, not only had he profited handsomely, he\u2019d found the bats\u2019 cave, where he had experienced wonderful night of sleep.An unsightly expression could be seen on Du Lingfei\u2019s face as she glared at Bai Xiaochun. Snorting coldly, she thought back to the complicated feelings she had felt, and suddenly felt even more annoyed with Bai Xiaochun.A cold glitter passed through Feng Yan\u2019s eyes, although his expression was one of joy. \u201cJunior Brother Bai! I\u2019m so glad to see you safe. We worried about you the entire night.\u201dBai Xiaochun chuckled, and although his expression seemed normal, deep within his eyes, a cold gleam flickered.Soon, the three of them were on their way again, seated in the ship. Considering what had just happened, Bai Xiaochun suggested that they fly on the ship at night and proceed along on foot during the day. In rare fashion, Du Lingfei agreed, and as for Feng Yan, after a moment of thought, he nodded.Thus, they proceeded along down the Heavenspan River as they headed toward the lower reaches.A month passed.This was the farthest Bai Xiaochun had ever traveled in his entire life. He saw numerous mountains and jungles, places where there was no sign of human habitation at all, and everything was like a huge wilderness.At one point in their travels, the ground began to quake, and Bai Xiaochun looked off into the distant mountains to see something completely astonishing. It was an enormous giant covered in thick fur, which caused the ground to shudder with each step it took.The sight of the giant caused Bai Xiaochun to gasp.One night when they were flying along, lightning crashed off in the distance, and Bai Xiaochun saw\u2026 an enormous bird that was just as large as Fragrant Cloud Peak. As it whistled along through the air, countless bolts of lightning danced across its body. The mere sight of such a creature flying along in the middle of the night was completely astonishing.The most memorable thing Bai Xiaochun saw was during the daytime when he caught sight of a beast on the south bank of the river. It had four stumpy legs, and a head as huge as a mountain. Suddenly, a huge 30,000-meter golden crocodile burst out from within the Heavenspan River and gobbled up the first creature. As the crocodile sank back down into the water, it cast a cold glance at Bai Xiaochun and the others.That single glanced caused their minds to reel, and blood to ooze out of the corners of their mouths. Splitting pain tore at their eyes, and it took a long moment for them to recover.Bai Xiaochun shivered and then muttered, \u201cTerrifying. The outside is so terrifying!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even his scalp numbed after what had just happened, let alone Du Lingfei, who was petrified.Thankfully, none of the incredibly powerful creatures they encountered showed any interest in attacking them. At the most, they would look over curiously. Apparently, the auras cast off by the group of three caused such creatures steer clear of them.Bai Xiaochun got the feeling that it was because they were disciples of the Spirit Stream Sect. Although this area was far away from the sect, it was still within their sphere of influence.Despite the fear the group felt, they continued onward. After the first month of travel, they made contact with the sect on a pre-appointed day, informing them of their current location. The same thing happened after the second month. It was around that time that they reached the area in the Fallenstar Mountains which was the border of the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s territory.Along the way, Feng Yan had considered making a secret strike against Bai Xiaochun, but the things he was seeing along the journey left him unnerved. He was in no mood for fighting, and when you coupled that with how cautious Bai Xiaochun was being, and how close he stuck to Du Lingfei, Feng Yan was simply too apprehensive, and couldn\u2019t find a chance to make his move. In the end, he was forced to simply bide his time.When Feng Yan looked at Bai Xiaochun, an imperceptibly sinister flicker could be seen in his eyes.\u201cSo, he\u2019s really determined to kill me, huh\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought, eyes narrowing. \u201cHates me that much\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was getting worried. He was a perceptive person, and was now very sure of what was going on in Feng Yan\u2019s head.The Fallenstar Mountains were a mountain range that swept from north to south. They looked endless, like an enormous sleeping dragon that split apart the lands.In fact, even the sky looked different above the mountains, almost as if it were tinged with blood.According to the legends, many years ago, a star had fallen from the skies and slammed into the earth, causing some of the lands to collapse, and other parts to rise up into the form of this mountain range.The mountains were covered with dense jungle and filled with wild beasts. However, numerous rare types of plants and vegetation could be found there. Because of that, there were always cultivators willing to go in and brave the danger, however terrifying it might seem.\u201cThese are the Fallenstar Mountains,\u201d Du Lingfei said. The long journey had left her exhausted, so to catch sight of their final destination after all this time caused her to sigh with relief.\u201cThe last messages sent to the sect by Junior Brother Hou came from this area,\u201d Feng Yan said, producing a magical device from his bag of holding: a Feng Shui compass.The Feng Shui compass had a silver needle on it, which was currently spinning around in circles.\u201cAccording to sect rules, disciples on outside missions are supposed to notify the sect of their location every month. This Spirit Stream Compass should help us locate Junior Brother Hou\u2019s last known position.\u201d Even as he spoke, the silver needle on the Feng Shui compass suddenly pointed off in one particular direction.\u201cGot it!\u201d Feng Yan said, flashing into motion. Du Lingfei\u2019s expression flickered as she followed along behind him.Bai Xiaochun looked out over the Fallenstar Mountains, and the thick vegetation which covered them. It was like a sea of plants, within which could be heard the cries of various beasts. Even the occasional roar echoed out.Bai Xiaochun had a very serious expression on his face as he activated the shield from his jade pendant. With that in place, not even the slightest breeze would get past him unnoticed. Only then did he cautiously follow after Feng Yan.Feng Yan and Du Lingfei proceeded along without pausing for a moment, speeding along through the Fallenstar Mountains until they found themselves deep in a valley. The valley was filled with trees that had been growing together for so many years that their branches were all interlocked. The knotted and gnarled bark added to the effect; if it were nighttime, the entire scene would be extremely terrifying.After proceeding along through the valley for two hours, they suddenly came to a stop. Feng Yan looked down at the Feng Shui compass, the needle of which was pointing toward a tree with a trunk so wide that ten people could circle around it with arms extended.Feng Yan looked at Bai Xiaochun and then pointed toward the huge tree. \u201cJunior Brother Bai, please go investigate.\u201dBai Xiaochun hesitated for a moment, then looked the tree over. Seeing nothing initially suspicious, he tapped the jade pendant hanging at his waist, causing the green shield to grow a bit stronger. He also placed some paper talismans onto his body before finally edging closer.\u201cSo afraid of dying, and yet you still want to practice cultivation?!\u201d Du Lingfei gave a cold harrumph. She have never liked Bai Xiaochun, so even though she herself was afraid of the dangers they had witnessed, to see him so incredibly terrified of dying made her look down on him even more.Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t have the time to worry about Du Lingfei. Cautiously approaching the tree, he noticed a portion of bark that seemed to have grown recently. Taking out a flying sword, he cut away that portion of the tree and found that a jade slip was hidden inside.After removing the jade slip from the tree, Bai Xiaochun scanned it with divine sense, whereupon his expression flickered, and he tossed the slip over to Feng Yan.Within that jade slip was a single fragment of information.I found some other clues, and I\u2019m going to the Luochen Clan to get proof\u2026.After looking at it for a moment, Feng Yan frowned, and then handed the jade slip to Du Lingfei. Du Lingfei looked at it, whereupon her expression turned grim.\u201cThe Luochen Clan\u2026.\u201d she murmured after a long moment. Then she turned to stare deeper into the Fallenstar Mountains.These mountains were very large, and filled with numerous natural resources. Considering that this place was on the very edge of Spirit Stream Sect territory, where it bordered with the territory of the Blood Stream Sect, it was only natural that the Spirit Stream Sect would have the area guarded. Those guards were none other than\u2026 the Luochen Clan.The Luochen Clan was a relatively large clan, which had stood guard in the Fallenstar Mountains for a thousand years. Every generation of the clan had Foundation Establishment Patriarchs. Generally speaking, the mere threat posed by such people was more than enough to help them in their duties of guardianship.In fact, the mission instructions even said to make contact with the Luochen Clan if they ran into any danger.However, Hou Yunfei\u2019s jade slip seemed to indicate that the Luochen Clan\u2026 was where he had been heading to find some sort of evidence. After that was when he lost contact.\u201cWhat do you guys think?\u201d Feng Yan asked. \u201cShould we go check out the Luochen Clan?\u201d Feng Yan glanced over casually at Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei.Bai Xiaochun immediately said, \u201cElder Brother Feng, Elder Sister Du, having found this jade slip, our mission is complete\u2026. We should put safety first. What\u2019s the point in going on?\u201d This entire place made Bai Xiaochun feel as if an invisible pressure was weighing down on him.Du Lingfei hesitated for a moment. If they went back now, they would only be able to acquire the minimum amount of merit points. However, if they investigated further, they might be able to get more.Feng Yan could see that Du Lingfei was hesitating, and he frowned, thinking about how going back now might reduce the chances he had to kill Bai Xiaochun.After a moment, he said, \u201cI think we should go to the Luochen Clan and look around. We\u2019ve come all the way here, how could we simply go back now? After we find out exactly what befell Junior Brother Hou, we might even be able to get help from the Luochen Clan in finding him. If we do, we\u2019ll be rewarded with many more merit points.\u201cFurthermore\u2026 as long as we don\u2019t go into the depths of the Fallenstar Mountains, we should be relatively safe. Besides, if you\u2019re worried about the Luochen Clan, don\u2019t forget that all of the cultivator clans in Spirit Stream Sect territory have special seals placed into their blood, making it impossible for them to turn traitor. How could they possibly treat us with any disrespect?\u201d After he finished speaking, Feng Yan looked over slowly at Du Lingfei.She nodded. After all, what he said made sense. \u201cVery well. We\u2019ll go to the Luochen Clan to look around. Who knows, maybe Junior Brother Hou left the Luochen Clan, and then went missing.\u201dSeeing that she had agreed, Feng Yan smiled. Then he turned to look at Bai Xiaochun, and his gaze grew a bit colder.Frowning, Bai Xiaochun asked: \u201cWe accomplished the mission, why let ourselves get dragged into side issues?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re so scared, then just don\u2019t come with us,\u201d Du Lingfei said, turning a cold shoulder to Bai Xiaochun as she headed off.\u201cJunior Brother Bai,\u201d Feng Yan said, \u201cI\u2019m responsible for evaluating our performance on this task. We\u2019re supposed to make our decisions unanimously. If you don\u2019t come with us, it will make it hard to make my evaluation.\u201d With an enigmatic smile, he began to follow Du Lingfei. In his opinion, Bai Xiaochun was sure to come along. If he didn\u2019t, Du Lingfei would be able to corroborate the fact that the had committed dereliction of duty. When that happened, the Hall of Justice surely wouldn\u2019t let things slide.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face darkened, and his blood began to surge through his veins as he stared with bloodshot eyes at Feng Yan walking away. He might be afraid of death, but as of this point, he was coming to the conclusion that he needed to take control of the situation. Only by settling things with Feng Yan could he ensure that his own position was stable.\u201cFeng Yan, you\u2019re forcing my hand!\u201d he thought. After standing there reticently for a few breaths of time, he bowed his head for a moment, then strode forward to follow Du Lingfei and Feng Yan. Soon, they disappeared into the jungle.Four hours later, they were still hurrying along. Evening was falling, and the sun was setting, ensuring that the jungle was slowly getting darker and darker.\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Feng Yan suddenly said. The three of them stopped walking and looked off into the jungle. Up ahead, the trees thinned out, and numerous limestone boulders could be seen protruding out of the ground.Numerous courtyard houses were visible, which were organized into the larger form of a mansion that could apparently house hundreds of people. At this time of evening, a clan would normally be at its most active, but unexpectedly, the mansion was completely dark and quiet. Considering the darkness of the sky, the entire place seemed almost abandoned.The only light provided was by two lanterns which hung at the main gate. Even though there was no wind, the two lanterns swayed back and forth, casting flickering shadows onto the guardian stone lions beneath them.The scene caused Feng Yan and Du Lingfei\u2019s faces to flicker.As for Bai Xiaochun, as soon as he laid eyes on the mansion, a feeling of impending danger rose up in his heart. It felt like every inch of flesh on his body wanted to scream.\u201cSomething\u2019s off about\u2013\u201d Feng Yan said, his heart thumping. However, before he could even finish speaking, the main gate slammed open, and a vile wind blew out. At the same time, a figure emerged noiselessly through the gate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Bai Xiaochun was so nervous that he started slapping paper talismans all over himself.The figure which had just appeared held a lantern in its hand, and stood in the opened gate, wreathed in shadows as it gazed at the three of them.\u201cWhy, might I ask, have the three of you come to the Luochen Clan on this dark evening?\u201dThe flickering light of the lantern just barely revealed a young man, standing there looking at them calmly. He wore a long, green robe, and his face was pale and devoid of any color of blood.After seeing that that it was a person who had appeared, Feng Yan and Du Lingfei breathed sighs of relief. Somehow, the creepy feeling they had experienced moments ago had subsided a bit.Feng Yan clasped hands and said, \u201cHello, Fellow Daoist. We are are disciples of the Spirit Stream Sect, paying a visit to ask a few questions.\u201dBy this point, Du Lingfei had noticed the numerous shields which were flickering around Bai Xiaochun, and her brow furrowed in response.Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t notice Du Lingfei\u2019s look. For some reason, the fact that a young man had appeared hadn\u2019t caused his sensation of intense danger to lessen at all.\u201cAh, Fellow Daoists from the Spirit Stream Sect,\u201d the young man said. \u201cPlease, come in, and we can discuss matters\u2026.\u201d The flickering of the lantern cast shadows on the young man\u2019s face, making it difficult to see him clearly as he turned and walked off.The courtyard gate then opened wide to allow the three disciples to enter.Feng Yan hesitated for a moment, then walked through the gate. Du Lingfei followed along behind him. As for Bai Xiaochun, he looked around for a moment before gritting his teeth and cautiously entering the courtyard.Even as the large gate closed behind them, the two stone lions beneath the lanterns outside suddenly turned to look in the direction the gate, their eyes flickering with a blood-colored light.Inside the courtyard was a green limestone path that wound through various plants and decorative rocks. Faint moonlight shone down, casting everything into partial shadow. The only light came from the lantern, which swayed back and forth in the young man\u2019s hand.The four of them walked along the path, surrounded by gloomy silence. This place almost seemed like a different world than the one beyond the gate.On the right-hand side of the path were several fruit trees, laden with red fruit. Strangely, despite a lack of any breeze within the courtyard, the leaves on those trees suddenly rustled.Du Lingfei and Feng Yan seemed more on guard than ever, and Bai Xiaochun, who was last in line, looked around cautiously in all directions. For some reason, those rustling fruit trees seemed very bizarre.Gradually, a smell like that of fresh blood rose up, faint, but simultaneously distinct.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart began to thump, and he was just about to say something when, all of a sudden, fruit began to fall off of the fruit trees, landing on the ground and rolling toward Bai Xiaochun and the others. Strangely, faces could be seen on the fruit, child-like faces with broad smiles that almost seemed to have been painted on.\u201cLa la la! Hello!\u201dArms and legs sprouted out of the fruit, and as they ran toward Bai Xiaochun and the others, they clasped hands and then began to skip in circles around the shocked group of three.At the same time, the fruits began to cry out in excited voices: \u201cAuntie said to be good and not cry! We can only laugh! Ripe fruit is the best fruit!\u201dTheir voices were very charming and sweet as they danced around and began to sing children\u2019s lullabies. Now that they were so close, it was possible to smell a sweet fragrance wafting about. It was so sickly sweet, in fact, that upon inhaling it, Bai Xiaochun and the others felt as if they were about to puke their guts out.When the fruit got too close to the young man with the lantern, he completely ignored them, and even stepped on some of them, crushing them. However, the crushed fruits simply crawled back to their feet, smiling as they continued to dance and sing.\u201cWhat the hell are these things?!\u201d Feng Yan exclaimed, eyes flickering. He waved his sleeve, causing a gust of wind to kick up and send some of the fruits flying away. After splatting onto the ground, they lurched back to their feet and re-joined the circle, laughing just as loudly as before.Bai Xiaochun felt goosebumps rising up all over him, and by this point he was fully surrounded by flickering shields.Du Lingfei looked at the fruits all holding hands and singing, and her facial expression flickered with fear. Pushing down the disgust in her heart, she gritted her teeth, and her phoenix-like eyes flashed with anger. She was just about to perform an incantation gesture when suddenly, the fruits\u2019 faces fell in terror.\u201cAuntie\u2019s coming!!\u201d they cried, running pell-mell back to the tree and leaping up into their original positions. Soon, their laughter and singing had faded away, and they looked like nothing more than ordinary fruit.The young man from the Luochen Clan didn\u2019t look back at them, but they could hear his voice as he said, \u201cThose are some spirit fruits the Patriarch brought back from the depths of the Fallenstar Mountains. What do you think of their singing, Fellow Daoists? They love to sing.\u201dUnsightly expressions appeared on the faces of Feng Yan and Du Lingfei as they followed along.Bai Xiaochun was still in the very back. Suddenly, the cold feeling of fear rose up inside of him as he realized that\u2026 another set of footsteps could be heard!Step, step, step\u2026.It was impossible to determine when exactly this development had occurred, but as of this moment\u2026 there were clearly five people walking along the path!Perhaps those footsteps had been mingled in with theirs from the moment they had entered the courtyard, and they hadn\u2019t noticed because of the strange fruits. But now, in the silence that followed the fruits\u2019 outburst, the sound of the additional footsteps was extremely conspicuous.The echoing footfalls caused Bai Xiaochun to shiver. What was most frightening was that the footsteps were coming from right behind him. Suddenly, an icy breeze seemed to run down his back, as if someone were behind him, breathing on him.\u201cHey guys\u2026\u201d he said, \u201cdid any of you realize\u2026 there\u2019s another set of footsteps!?\u201d As the hairs on the back of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s neck rose up, Feng Yan\u2019s face flickered as he also detected the footsteps.Du Lingfei\u2019s pupils constricted, and she began to pant.The three of them suddenly stopped walking, and as they did, the sound of the other footsteps vanished.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart was pounding. Gritting his teeth, he slowly turned his head to find himself staring into the eyes of a young woman wearing a red robe!Her robes swayed gently, and her face was as ashen, as if she were dead. She smiled oddly at Bai Xiaochun for a moment before her lips twitched, and she said, \u201cThis fire won\u2019t do, help me.\u201dThe suddenness of what had just occurred caused Bai Xiaochun to leap into the air and scream. The red-robed young woman suddenly transformed into a streak of light that vanished in the blink of an eye.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face was pale white as he looked around, but nothing was there\u2026 except for the echoing sound of his own scream.Du Lingfei and Feng Yan looked around in fright. Although they didn\u2019t see any unusual figure like Bai Xiaochun did, their hearts were still pounding.Then, a woman\u2019s voice suddenly rang out, singing a song. The lyrics drifted throughout the courtyard, strange and mysterious, almost like a lullaby being sung to soothe a baby. The mere sound of it caused the darkness to seem even more spine-tingling than before.\u201cGood little baby, it\u2019s time to sleep; the wind is blowing and the flames do leap; don\u2019t you weep and don\u2019t make a peep\u2026.\u201d\u201cEnough with the parlor tricks!\u201d Feng Yan blurted, clearly nervous. He instantly performed an incantation gesture, summoning a flying sword, which began to swirl around him.Simultaneously, the young man with the lantern turned around to look at them. The flickering light from the lantern made him appear stranger than ever.\u201cWhat are you standing there for? Come on, let\u2019s keep going.\u201d He smiled, a smile that was somehow very abnormal.Feng Yan took a deep breath, and then his eyes glinted with a fierce light as he said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going anywhere. Look, we\u2019re here to investigate the disappearance of one of our fellow disciples. Fellow Daoist, do you happen to remember anyone like us coming around here about five months ago?\u201dDu Lingfei had already pulled out a magical device, and her eyes were shining in concentration.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d replied the young man. His softly spoken words floated out into the air and seemed to harmonize with the woman\u2019s singing voice.\u201cFellow Daoist,\u201d Du Lingfei suddenly said, \u201chow come none of your fellow clan members are around?\u201dThe young man\u2019s smile widened to the point of looking unnatural. \u201cOh they\u2019re out on business. Are you done with your questions?\u201d\u201cYes, we\u2019re done here,\u201d said Feng Yan. \u201cWe\u2019ll take our leave now.\u201d With that, he turned to walk the other way back down the path. Du Lingfei followed suit, and as for Bai Xiaochun, he had long since taken to flight, and was further on ahead of them.The young man\u2019s smile was now so wide that the sides of his mouth began to rip open, almost as if his head were about to be torn in half! \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go any further, the least you could do is stay behind\u2026 stay behind to keep us company\u2026.\u201dThe lantern suddenly turned a greenish color, making the entire courtyard even darker than before. Even as the words left the young man\u2019s mouth, he suddenly began to float through the air toward Feng Yan.Feng Yan\u2019s face fell, and he performed an incantation gesture and pointed out, sending his flying sword speeding toward the young man. A boom rang out as the young man let the sword stab through him. Then, his smile widened even further as he shot toward Feng Yan.Panting, Feng Yan fell back, simultaneously pulling out a black medicinal pill, which he threw down onto the ground. A rattling boom echoed out as the pill then exploded.The charging young man was hit by the blast and sent tumbling backward, his body riddled with wounds. However, he apparently didn\u2019t feel any pain whatsoever. Smiling the same as ever, he arced through the air as fast as a kite on a windy day, to once again charge toward Feng Yan.In the spot where the medicinal pill had exploded, numerous glowing lines were now visible, all of which emanated a strong aura of death as they began to form together, as if they were repairing themselves.As soon as he saw the designs on the ground, Feng Yan cried out in alarm, \u201cThere\u2019s a spell formation here! It\u2019s a Shadowhell Formation!!\u201dAt the same time, the green limestone beneath Du Linfgfei\u2019s feet began to vibrate, and then eyes popped open upon them. Emaciated, corpse-like arms as skinny as twigs stretched out. Just beneath the surface of the skin of those arms were countless, worm-like creatures, wriggling and writhing. Those arms\u2026 grabbed Du Lingfei\u2019s right leg.Voices rose up from the green limestone, sinister, fear-inspiring voices.\u201cIt hurts when you step on us\u2026.\u201d\u201cCome. Come be with us\u2026.\u201dDu Lingfei\u2019s face was ashen. She quickly performed an incantation gesture and pointed out, causing a flag to fly out from her bag of holding. It instantly transformed into two mist beasts, which swirled around her defensively. Simultaneously, a flying sword appeared, and the sword light that shimmered out severed the hands which had grabbed onto her leg, allowing her to fall back.As for Bai Xiaochun, the woman\u2019s singing suddenly grew louder in his ears.\u201cDon\u2019t you weep and don\u2019t make a peep\u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Eyes crimson, he let out a powerful shout as he slapped more and more paper talismans down onto his body, causing more and more shields to spring up. Soon, he was surrounded by a barrier almost two meters thick.Almost in the same moment that all the shields sprang up, the red-robed woman suddenly lunged out of the darkness toward Bai Xiaochun.A bang could be heard as she pierced roughly thirty percent into the shield barrier before being stopped in place. Then she screamed, a scream that was apparently capable of piercing through the shields. When the ear-splitting sound stabbed into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s ears, he began to lose consciousness.Shocked, he bit his tongue hard, which made things clear just in time to see the woman transforming into a swarm of countless red beetles, which then began to batter against his shield.However, the shield was too thick, and the red beetles were incapable of piercing through the seventy percent that remained. After bouncing back, they flew back and re-formed into the shape of the red-robed woman.She stared at Bai Xiaochun for a moment, then began to laugh as she charged toward him once again.Simultaneously, popping sounds could be heard as the ornamental rocks began to ripple and rise up, transforming into Stone Golems. The fruit trees also sprouted arms and legs, wrenched themselves out from the ground and began to walk forward toward Bai Xiaochun and the others. Especially bizarre was the fact that the fruit on the trees began to laugh and sing nursery rhymes again.One of the trees joined the red-robed woman to specifically target Bai Xiaochun.\u201cPuppets!\u201d Du Lingfei gasped.Bai Xiaochun was trembling violently. In all the years in which he had lived, he had never experienced such a sensation of imminent danger. As the woman closed in on him, he quickly performed an incantation gesture, drawing upon all his spiritual energy as he waved his finger at her.Instantly, his wooden sword flew out at top speed, a black streak that kicked up a huge blast of wind. Then, a boom echoed out as the sword stabbed into the woman\u2019s head.The woman let out a shrill scream, and her body suddenly dissolved into a mass of red beetles, which twitched and spasmed as they fell down onto the ground and then shattered into pieces.The wooden sword didn\u2019t vanish; after stabbing through the woman\u2019s head, it continued to speed onward toward the fruit tree behind her.It stabbed through the tree, which lurched to a stop and then suddenly exploded. Instantly, the fruit on the tree shriveled up, and yet continued to sing happily even as they died.Everything that was happening caused the hair on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s body to stand on end. Thankfully, his wooden sword was extremely powerful, and after stabbing through the tree, it continued to sail through the air and then blasted a hole into the nearby wall. As soon as the hole appeared, though, tentacle-like tendrils began to swirl out from the broken sides, as if the wall were preparing to re-form itself.\u201cGet out through that hole!\u201d Du Lingfei cried, instantly flickering into motion. However, Feng Yan was the closest of all of them to the hole in the wall. Wincing at the pain of wasting such a valuable item, he produced another of the black medicinal pills and then threw it down in front of the young man with the lantern. A huge boom echoed out. Feng Yan then borrowed the force of the resulting explosion to fly toward the hole.Just when he was on the verge of shooting out through the hole, though, his face fell, as two huge stone lions leapt in from outside. Roaring, they charged, one of them toward Feng Yan, the other toward Bai Xiaochun.Astonishingly, these were the same two stone lions which had been standing guard outside the main gate!\u201cYou can\u2019t escape,\u201d said the young man with the lantern. \u201cEveryone from the Spirit Stream Sect\u2026 shall DIE!\u201d He began to laugh as he once again began to fight with Feng Yan.When Feng Yan saw that the hole in the wall was already beginning to mend itself, he roared, hands flashing in a double-handed incantation gesture as he summoned a head-sized fireball. That fireball emanated blistering heat as it expanded, sending a wave of flames out in all directions.The stone lions were shoved back, and the young Luochen Clan cultivator\u2019s face flickered. There were also two Treants who were caught up in the flames, one of which exploded.The other Treant tried to fall back, but was then directly hit by Du Lingfei\u2019s deadly flying sword.Rumbling booms echoed out as green sap exploded out from the destroyed Treants. At the same time, it was revealed that inside of the two Treants were emaciated, gasping figures, whose life force seemed to have been almost completely absorbed.One of those figures collapsed, unconscious, whereas the other struggled to open his eyes, and then looked excitedly at Du Lingfei.\u201cElder Brother Hou!\u201d she cried, having instantly recognized Hou Yunfei. She immediately scooped him up into her arms.At the same time, the weakened Hou Yunfei grabbed Du Lingfei\u2019s arm and poured his last remaining bit of spiritual power into her. \u201cThe Luochen Clan has turned traitor. We have to get out of here and warn the sect!!\u201dDu Lingfei\u2019s spiritual energy instantly swelled. Gritting her teeth, she held Hou Yunfei in her arms as she shot toward the hole in the wall with even greater speed.When Bai Xiaochun looked over, he instantly recognized Hou Yunfei. Then, he flickered into motion as he dodged the stone lion and sped toward the hole in the wall.As of this point, Du Lingfei was now closest to the breach in the wall, with Feng Yan and Bai Xiaochun close on her heels. The fastest of them all was Bai Xiaochun, who was quickly closing the distance between himself and Du Lingfei.Feng Yan\u2019s face was pale white. The fireball he had just unleashed had taken quite a toll on him. However, after noticing the speed with which Bai Xiaochun was moving, his eyes suddenly flickered with a cold glow, and he held up his hand, within which could be seen a black medicinal pill.\u201cJunior Sister Du, you have to get word back to the sect! I\u2019ll give you a bit of extra power!\u201d With that, he flung the black medicinal pill down into the space between Du Lingfei and Bai Xiaochun.As the medicinal pill exploded, a powerful force blasted out, pushing Du Lingfei toward the hole even faster than before. Then, a plopping sound like splashing water could be heard as she burst out.In contrast, Bai Xiaochun was blocked by the explosion, and was suddenly set upon by the stone lion. Instantly, his eyes turned bright red.\u201cFeng Yan!!\u201d he bellowed. A wind blasted out as the stone lion pounced. Just as Bai Xiaochun was about to dodge, three Treants closed in. There were now four puppets all attacking him simultaneously, making it impossible to evade.A popping sound could be heard as his shields glittered brightly and then began to shatter. Even the green shield from the jade pendant faded and shattered. Although the majority of the force of the blow was dissipated, the stone lion was extraordinary, and it\u2019s attack landed fully on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s chest.The massive force sent Bai Xiaochun flying, his entire body shaking.\u201cJunior Brother Bai!\u201d Feng Yan cried said. Although a cold smile twisted his lips, his words sounded bitter and lamenting. And yet, he didn\u2019t slow down at all; in the blink of an eye, he passed into the rippling hole in the wall. Just when he was about to burst through to the other side, the young Luochen Clan cultivator let out a piercing shriek, then suddenly exploded into a mass of countless chunks of flesh, all devoid of blood, which then shot toward Feng Yan.Before Feng Yan could pass through the gap in the wall, the chunks of flesh wrapped around him and began to drag him backward.Feng Yan let out a roar of rage as he was pulled out. By this point, the hole in the wall was on the verge of closing up completely.After gritting his teeth for a moment, he then bit down on his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood, which landed onto his flying sword. The flying sword instantly turned crimson. Instead of shooting out in attack, it then exploded, transforming into a cloud of shrapnel that shot back toward him.Although it was injurious to himself, the hail of shrapnel also managed to slash away the chunks of flesh which had grabbed ahold of him!He was now freed, but was also covered in a mass of cuts and wounds. The pain from his mangled flesh threatened to render him unconscious, but he was still able to clench his jaw and shoot back toward the hole in the wall.Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun had been slammed by the lion\u2019s paw, sending him tumbling backward, screaming. And yet, even as his scream was still echoing out into the air, Bai Xiaochun looked down in surprise at his chest to discover that, although his clothing was shredded, his skin hadn\u2019t been harmed at all. In fact\u2026 he didn\u2019t even feel any pain.After performing a quick inspection, he confirmed that\u2026 although the situation had seemed extremely dangerous\u2026 he hadn\u2019t been hurt in the least.The stone lion\u2019s blow had sent him flying, but other than that, it had done virtually nothing.Even as his elation grew, the Treants closed in, and one of them punched him in the back. Although he was thrown forward, he felt no pain at all, whereupon he threw his head back and laughed uproariously.\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually so strong! Fudge! What do I have to be afraid of?!\u201d Enlivened, and now fully confident, he shot into the air toward the gap in the wall, moving with even greater speed than before. In the blink of an eye, he was at the gap.Feng Yan was now about halfway through the gap, and didn\u2019t even notice Bai Xiaochun and his sudden burst of speed. In his mind, Bai Xiaochun had probably already been killed by the numerous puppets.Just as Feng Yan was about to free himself, a furious gleam appeared in Bai Xiaochun eyes, and he reached out toward Feng Yan\u2019s shoulder, which was already outside of the hole.\u201cFree at last!\u201d Feng Yan laughed. But then, he suddenly felt a huge force dragging him back through the hole.\u201cNo!!\u201d he howled. Before he could even see what was dragging him, he felt his bag of holding slip away, and then he was flung deep into the courtyard, away from the gap.It was only at this point that he saw Bai Xiaochun.\u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201d he howled, eyes bloodshot. However, he was now cut off by the two stone lions. Booms rang out, followed by a miserable scream.\u201cElder Brother Feng!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun screamed, simultaneously leaping through the hole in the wall.Just as he emerged on the other side, the hole finished closing up.He was now outside, no longer in the courtyard of the Luochen Clan. As for Du Lingfei, she had continued to run as soon as she had emerged, and was now waiting some distance off at the edge of the forest. When she saw Bai Xiaochun appear, she was just about to call out to him when he suddenly began to wail miserably.\u201cElder Brother Feng!! Not only did you give me your bag of holding to help me escape, you also held off the puppets. Oh, Elder Brother Feng!\u201dAfter hearing Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words, Du Lingfei felt horrible. However, the gap was closed, and Bai Xiaochun was just standing there in grief and indignation, so she quickly said, \u201cBai Xiaochun, come on, let\u2019s go!\u201dNot needing any further coercion, Bai Xiaochun began to run, tears streaming down his face. Helping Du Lingfei support Hou Yunfei, they vanished into the forest.Looking over his shoulder, Bai Xiaochun frowned sadly and said, \u201cElder Brother Feng, such a good guy\u2026.\u201dDu Lingfei was very upset. She had never imagined that the mission would be this dangerous. Then she remembered Bai Xiaochun\u2019s suggestion to not come to the Luochen Clan, and realized that if they had listened to him, Feng Yan might not have died.And when she saw that Bai Xiaochun was in so much grief that he was on the verge of beating his own chest, she felt even worse. Finally, she sighed.\u201cJunior Brother Bai,\u201d she said, looking at him bitterly, \u201clet\u2019s hurry up. If the Luochen Clan has turned traitor, they won\u2019t want the sect getting wind of it. I just tried to send word back, but there\u2019s interference in the area\u2026. Transmission jade slips won\u2019t work.\u201dBai Xiaochun shivered, feeling more in danger than ever before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In one part of the necropolis was a lake of simmering blood, filled with countless floating skeletons.The glitter of a spell formation could be seen surrounding the entire thing, and countless members of the Luochen Clan were prostrating themselves around the lake. There were men and women, youngsters and old-timers, all of whom knelt at key nexuses within the spell formation.It was with utter solemnity that one by one, they would slice open their right hands and squeeze blood down onto the nexuses, which carried the blood into the central lake.In the very middle of that lake of blood, an old man sat cross-legged. His hair was long and white, and he seemed threatening without being angry. With every breath he took, the lake of blood bubbled.Suddenly, the man\u2019s eyes opened, and they gleamed with a blood-colored glow.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!?\u201d he demanded, his cold voice echoing throughout the necropolis.One of the clan members closest to him was a young man, who looked exactly like the young man from up in the courtyard who had tried to kill Bai Xiaochun and the others. He leaned over and whispered, \u201cPatriarch, three disciples from the Spirit Stream Sect showed up. It happened so quickly that I was caught unprepared. I was worried that it would influence the larger task at hand, so my puppet body on the outside, along with the spell formation and the other puppets, tried to kill them. Unfortunately\u2026 I\u2019m so useless, Senior. I only managed to kill one. The other two escaped, and\u2026 they took the other disciple we caught last time with them.\u201dThe young man was feeling quite discouraged. Normally speaking, if a disciple of the Spirit Stream Sect went missing, it would take at least half a year before the sect officially declared them as missing. Only then would other disciples be sent to investigate. Considering that, by the time such disciples arrived in the Fallenstar Mountains, at least nine months should have passed.However, only four months had gone by, and yet disciples from the Spirit Stream Sect had already arrived. It wasn\u2019t just this young man who was taken aback. No one in the entire Luochen Clan could have guessed that the disappearance of a mere Outer Sect disciple was anything to worry about. Logically speaking, no one should have been sent to investigate so quickly.Furthermore, if Hou Yunfei hadn\u2019t managed to uncover the secrets of the Luochen Clan, they would never have take him captive. According to their original plan, they needed half a year to be completely prepared, then rise up and free themselves from the control of the Spirit Stream Sect!However, that meant they still need a month of time\u2026.\u201cTwo Outer Sect disciples\u2026? Hmph! The defensive spell formation has already been activated. Seal the area and send people to track them down and kill them. We only need one more month\u2026 and then nothing will be able to stop us!\u201d The old man didn\u2019t seem to be worried at all about what had happened, and closed his eyes to continue meditating.The young man sighed, bowing his head in compliance.It didn\u2019t take long before seven figures emerged from within the Luochen Clan. The one in the lead position was the same young man, whose cultivation base was in the eighth level of Qi Condensation.Of the other six, the weakest were in the sixth level of Qi Condensation, with two being in the seventh.\u201cThey won\u2019t be able to get far. Let\u2019s go!\u201d The seven cultivators shot into the jungle, eyes shining with killing intent.Out in the jungle, Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei were moving along as fast as possible while simultaneously propping up Hou Yunfei. They tried to use their Windskiff, but apparently the same interference from the spell formation that made transmission jade slips inoperable had the same effect on the ship.The expressions on the faces of Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei grew even darker.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face was pale, and the sensation of imminent crisis within him couldn\u2019t be greater. Every inch of flesh and blood within him was screaming out at him to flee as fast as he could!If he went any slower, he would surely die!The sensation of danger was far greater than what he had felt from Feng Yan. After all, even though Feng Yan had tried to kill him, he had been nervous about it and tried to do it secretly.Bai Xiaochun had known all along that as long as he was careful, he would most likely be able to avoid whatever move Feng Yan made against him, and could probably even strike back at him.But now\u2026 the instant he thought about the information in their possession, he trembled, and sweat began to pour down his face. Considering that they knew about the Luochen Clan\u2019s betrayal, it was obvious that they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to kill all of them.They would no doubt go to any and all lengths to ensure their silence.Furthermore, they wouldn\u2019t strike out in secret, they would attack like a lightning bolt!Nor would they allow much time for them to get very far away. In fact, there were almost certainly members of the Luochen Clan chasing after them already.\u201cDamn you, Hall of Justice. This mission\u2026 is not the type that Outer Sect disciples can handle!!\u201d Then Bai Xiaochun remembered that the Luochen Clan had a Foundation Establishment Patriarch, and he began to shake even harder.\u201cFoundation Establishment\u2026. The difference between Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment is like the difference between being mortal and being in Qi Condensation\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was so nervous that his eyes were bloodshot.\u201cI practice cultivation\u2026 to live forever\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun wanted to cry, but no tears would come. He looked over at Hou Yunfei, and knew that he would never be able to abandon him just to gain some speed. That was something he could never bring himself to do.Du Lingfei\u2019s face was pale; her cultivation base was the weakest of them all, and her internal spiritual energy was recovering very slowly. The more time passed, the worse she felt about the situation.She knew that they were facing almost certain death. Perhaps someone in the seventh level of Qi Condensation might be able to fight back against a Foundation Establishment Patriarch. But now, Feng Yan was dead, and she was only in the fifth level of Qi Condensation, with no hope of being able to break through to the next level any time soon. As for Bai Xiaochun\u2026 considering how scared he was of dying, Du Lingfei would never place any hope in him.\u201cI never imagined I would die on my first mission outside of the sect,\u201d she thought, laughing bitterly. However, things weren\u2019t over yet, and it wasn\u2019t the time to give up, so she gritted her teeth and produced a medicinal pill from within her bag of holding and popped it into her mouth. Then she looked over at Bai Xiaochun, who was pale-faced and shivering, and she sighed. At the moment, she no longer felt any scorn for him. Producing a medicinal pill bottle, she tossed it over to him.\u201cJunior Brother Bai, make sure to keep your internal spiritual energy up.\u201dBai Xiaochun stared in shock at the medicinal pill bottle, then opened it and consumed one of the pills. It was at this point that he suddenly remembered something, and produced two medicinal pill bottles from Feng Yan\u2019s bag of holding.\u201cElder Brother Feng had some medicinal pills,\u201d he said, handing one of the bottles to Du Lingfei.She accepted it silently, and the two of them proceeded along as fast as possible. Before long, they were back in the location where they had discovered Hou Yunfei\u2019s jade slip. When Du Lingfei saw that tree, she sighed inwardly.By now, it was useless to have regrets, so without another word, they continued to speed along. Gradually, Du Lingfei began to slow down, which made Bai Xiaochun even more nervous. Finally, he then grabbed her by the arm and pulled her along, carrying Hou Yunfei at the same time.Du Lingfei had long since noticed that Bai Xiaochun was much faster than her. When he grabbed her arm, she almost pulled away, but when she saw the look of terror on his face, she sighed and allowed him to pull her along.It was at this point that Hou Yunfei shivered, and his eyes slowly opened. He looked exhausted.After assessing his current position, he laughed bitterly and said, \u201cJunior Brother Bai, I never thought that, after all these years, we would meet again like this.\u201dSeeing that Hou Yunfei was awake, Du Lingfei quickly offered him a medicinal pill.Bai Xiaochun looked at Hou Yunfei and sighed. \u201cElder Brother Hou\u2026.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still hope for us,\u201d Hou Yunfei said. \u201cFor their own personal benefit, the Luochen Clan slaughtered people from the mortal world, extracting their blood and bones for use in a spell formation. Their Foundation Establishment Patriarch is currently presiding over the Inverse Blood Grand Magic, so he can\u2019t personally come after us. Furthermore, the entire Luochen Clan is maintaining the spell formation. Therefore\u2026 they won\u2019t be able to send very many people after us!\u201dHou Yunfei smiled, took the medicinal pill from Du Lingfei, and swallowed it. Then, his eyes began to shine as he said, \u201cAlthough we can\u2019t get a message to the sect from this location, if we get far enough away, we\u2019ll definitely be able to!\u201cSomething big like this, an entire cultivator clan rebelling, will definitely provoke a huge reaction from the sect!\u201dThanks to the medicinal pill, he no longer needed help from Bai Xiaochun, and began to speed along on his own power.Because of that, they managed to pick up speed. Soon, the borders of the Fallenstar Mountains became visible, and eventually, they shot out into the open, whereupon Du Lingfei pulled out a jade slip and tried to make contact with the sect. Moments later, her face drained of blood, and she shook her head.\u201cStill not working\u2026?\u201d muttered Bai Xiaochun, his heart pounding. Hou Yunfei merely stood there silently.None of them spoke any further as they continued on dejectedly. It was at this point that, all of a sudden, a whistling sound could be heard from behind them. Their faces fell as seven figures burst out of the trees not too far away.In the lead was the young man in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, who looked at Bai Xiaochun and the others, eyes flickering with killing intent.\u201cLike I said, you\u2026 can\u2019t get away! Never forget that the person who killed you is named Chen Yue! Kill them!\u201dThe Luochen Clan members immediately pulled out magical devices, and cold light appeared in their eyes as they closed in.The faces of Bai Xiaochun, Du Lingfei, and Hou Yunfei flickered, and they gritted their teeth as they tried to pick up speed.Chen Yue was laughing coldly as he flicked his sleeve, causing a violet skull to appear. As it sped through the air, it cackled madly, and within the blink of an eye, it was almost directly upon Bai Xiaochun and the others. At that point, Chen Yue waved his finger, and the skull exploded.The resulting shockwave sent the three Spirit Stream Sect disciples spinning apart. Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei suddenly lost their momentum, and were almost instantly surrounded by the Luochen Clan members.Bai Xiaochun, however, kept speeding along. Before, he had been somewhat held back by the other two, but now that he was on his own, he burst out with incredible speed, breaking free of the Luochen Clan members. It only took a moment for him to put dozens of meters between them, and from the look of it, he was only starting to pick up speed.Even Chen Yue, the only member of the Luochen Clan in the Eighth level of Qi Condensation, could do nothing but stare in shock.\u201cHe\u2019s fast,\u201d Chen Yue said coolly. \u201cFirst kill these two, then we\u2019ll go after him!\u201d Waving his sleeve, he turned to Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei, killing intent boiling.Du Lingfei coughed up a mouthful of blood. Her body was already spattered in blood; she was surrounded and certain that she was going to die. As she looked at Bai Xiaochun fleeing off into the distance, she began to laugh bitterly.She was well aware that Bai Xiaochun feared death, so although she wasn\u2019t very surprised, she couldn\u2019t help but feel bitter and hopeless.\u201cJunior Brother Bai, I hope you manage to get away\u2026.\u201d she thought. At the same time, she performed an incantation gesture, sending a flying sword out with the power of Lightness-in-Heaviness. Coughing up more blood, she continued to try to defend herself.Hou Yunfei was also laughing bitterly, but his eyes shone with a cold light. He let out a roar, and although his spiritual energy was mostly depleted, he wasn\u2019t ready to just give in. Gritting his teeth, he prepared to take some of the enemy with him as he died, if only to buy some more time for Bai Xiaochun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 53: Bravery!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53: Bravery!Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face was pale and his heart was pounding. The sensation of danger left him so alarmed that he felt like he might die at any moment, leaving him shaking uncontrollably.He had never been this frightened before in his entire life. Not when he had left his village to light the incense and brave the lightning, not when Li Qinghou had taken him to 10,000 Snakes Valley, not even when he had seen all those fantastic and powerful creatures while traveling.In all those situations, he had been nervous, but he had also been confident that\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t die!But today, he had the distinct sensation\u2026 that he was really going to die!!As he flew along, he suddenly realized that he was alone. Then he looked back in shock to see that the seven members of the Luochen Clan had surrounded Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei, several hundred meters back.He also saw that Du Lingfei was coughing up blood. Anyone in this situation would be able to tell that she and Hou Yunfei wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on for very long before they were cut down.A tremor ran through Bai Xiaochun as he stood there watching. He began to shake even harder, and his eyes were completely shot with blood. He could feel his very soul screaming at him to run away as quickly as possible.In fact, Bai Xiaochun was quite sure that, considering the speed he could maintain, and given that Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei were preventing the enemy from giving chase, there was actually a good chance\u2026 that he could get away.If he did, he could keep on living, he could continue to practice cultivation, and he could pursue what he really wanted: eternal life with no death. Not only would the sect not punish him if he survived, they would even reward him.However\u2026 if he simply ran away, leaving Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei to their deaths, he would feel guilty for the rest of his life. He felt as if his entire body had been split in half, with one half telling him to flee at top speed, otherwise he would die. The other half was telling him that if he left his fellow sect members to die, that he would never be able to rest at ease for the rest of his life!Panting, he let out a frustrated cry of anger. Blue veins popped out on his forehead, and he was shaking as hard as a tumbling die. At the moment, he wasn\u2019t thinking much about the specifics of the situation, or the potential consequences. His hands clenched into fists as a single thought ran through his head\u2026.\u201cI, Bai Xiaochun, might be afraid of dying, but\u2026 I\u2019m not gonna just run away!\u201d He suddenly began to beat at his chest with his fists. His eyes were completely bloodshot, and he let out a thunderous roar as he suddenly\u2026 shot back toward Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei!He moved so quickly that whistling sounds echoed out in all directions. Hou Yunfei trembled at the sight of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s sudden reversal in course, and his expression was hard to read. He looked astonished, thankful, and all of a sudden, he started laughing. Then, determination glimmered in his eyes, and without even thinking about defense, he charged toward the Luochen Clan members with everything he had.Simultaneously, Du Lingfei, whose body was splattered with blood from where a flying sword had slashed across her, looked up to see Bai Xiaochun, eyes bloodshot, roaring as he charged in their direction.She felt as if she had been struck by lightning, and her jaw dropped. Tears began to roll down her cheeks as numerous emotions flooded through her. She was touched, excited, and shaken.She knew how much Bai Xiaochun was afraid of dying, so when she saw him flying toward them, physically trembling, eyes crimson, she could only imagine how much bravery he had summoned\u2026 to stop running away, turn around, and then come back for them.\u201cGet out of here, you idiot! Run! Don\u2019t get yourself killed!!\u201d Tears streamed down her face. As Bai Xiaochun ran toward them bellowing at the top of his lungs, she didn\u2019t notice that one of the Luochen Clan disciples in the sixth level of Qi Condensation was unleashing a palm strike toward her back.A boom rang out, and blood sprayed out of her mouth. Her vision swam as she tumbled to the ground. Then, one of the Luochen Clan cultivators\u2019 flying swords began to speed through the air toward her head.When Bai Xiaochun saw what was happening, he let out an even more violent roar, and pushed forward with another burst of speed, reaching his very limit. He streaked through the air, turning into a beam of light that shot toward Du Lingfei. Even as the flying sword bore down on her, Bai Xiaochun landed at her side, scooped her up with one arm, then clenched his right hand into a fist and punched out toward the flying sword.A boom echoed out as the flying sword was sent spinning away by the force of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s blow.The Luochen Clan members were all greatly shocked. Chen Yue\u2019s eyes flickered with surprise, but then quickly began to radiate icy killing intent.\u201cNice. An expert in disguise. I should have noticed you back when you were in the Shadowhell Formation! Listen up everyone, ignore the other two and kill this guy!\u201d As soon as the words left his mouth, murderous looks appeared in the eyes of the other Luochen Clan members, and they began to close in on Bai Xiaochun.Du Lingfei was in a bit of a daze as Bai Xiaochun held her in his arms. Before she could do anything, he put her down off to the side and then shot toward the incoming Luochen Clan cultivators.His eyes were bright red, and it almost seemed that as of this moment, he wasn\u2019t thinking about dying at all. In fact, he wasn\u2019t thinking about anything except: Save Hou Yunfei. Save Du Lingfei. And kill all the enemies!The nearest of those opponents was in the sixth level of Qi Condensation, and as he closed in, his hands flickered in an incantation gesture. In response, a glowing awl suddenly appeared, which shot viciously toward Bai Xiaochun.\u201cScrew off!\u201d Bai Xiaochun roared, unleashing a ferocious palm strike. The little awl began to wobble, and when Bai Xiaochun\u2019s palm slammed into it, the glowing light shattered, and the awl was sent spinning away.The cultivator who had summoned the awl gasped, and an expression of shock flickered across his face. Just when he was about to fall back in retreat, Bai Xiaochun performed an incantation gesture and pointed out. His wooden sword appeared and shot out like lightning. It didn\u2019t matter that his opponent was in the sixth level of Qi Condensation; he was incapable of evading, and in fact, didn\u2019t even have time to react before the sword stabbed into his forehead.A miserable shriek echoed out as the wooden sword stabbed all the way through him, coming out the other side in a spray of blood. Then, it circled through the air and headed toward the next enemy.At the same time, one of the Luochen Clan members in the seventh level of Qi Condensation performed an incantation gesture, causing mist to roil up around him, making him look like an enormous mist giant. Even as he closed in, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand suddenly shot out, and his thumb and index fingers connected. Black light flickered, and the defenses provided by the mist could do nothing to stop the black light.Throat Crushing Grasp!Cracking sounds rang out as the mist dissipated. The cultivator\u2019s eyes went wide at the sight of the arm grabbing his neck. Then, his throat was completely crushed.Everything happened with incredible speed. Only a few breaths of time had passed since Bai Xiaochun had begun his charge, and already, two members of the Luochen Clan had been killed!Hou Yunfei, who had already fallen back to stand at Du Lingfei\u2019s side, gasped, and his eyes went wide with shock.Du Lingfei was completely and utterly taken aback. The Bai Xiaochun she was seeing right now was completely different from the one she remembered, causing her to pant in disbelief. Was this really the same Bai Xiaochun who was so afraid of dying?At this point, the remaining shocked members of the Luochen Clan finally unleashed their killing moves. These were their most powerful trump cards, one being a flying sword, another a pearl, and the last, a little cauldron, all of which shot toward Bai Xiaochun.Astonishingly, the three of them were joining forces to attack simultaneously!Of that group of three, two were in the sixth level of Qi Condensation, and one was in the seventh. Their combined attack was completely vicious as they went all out with everything they had to try to strike down Bai Xiaochun when he couldn\u2019t dodge.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were glowing red as the three closed in on him. Even as their magical devices bore down on him, he curled his arms and legs up until he looked like a ball. Previously, Du Lingfei had mocked the big black wok he wore on his back, but now, it covered him up completely.The little cauldron which had been unleashed by the cultivator in the seventh level of Qi Condensation slammed into the black wok, causing a boom to echo out that could shake Heaven and Earth. Cracks spread out across the wok, but it held strong against the cauldron.Next was the pearl. Rumbling sounds echoed out as it slammed into the wok. The wok couldn\u2019t hold up any longer, and exploded, transforming into countless black fragments that showered out in all directions. Bai Xiaochun shot out from the wreckage, flying toward the Qi Condensation seventh level cultivator.When the man saw Bai Xiaochun flying toward him, his face fell. He immediately fell back, but couldn\u2019t move fast enough.None of the magical protective items the man had could do anything to stop Bai Xiaochun, who slammed into him, causing the cracking sounds of breaking bones to ring out. Instantly, Bai Xiaochun went in for another attack, butting him with his head.BOOOMMMM!\u201cNo!!\u201d screamed the man. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and a look of despair filled his eyes, but he couldn\u2019t break free from Bai Xiaochun.Off to the side, his fellow clan members in the sixth level of Qi Condensation were nearly scared out of their minds. Trembling, one of them sent a flying sword toward Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun completely ignored it as he once again lunged toward the middle-aged man.The flying sword slammed into Bai Xiaochun, and in a completely shocking twist, it didn\u2019t stab into him, but rather, bounced off and was sent spinning away.Bai Xiaochun let out a roar, striking the middle-aged man once more. A bloodcurdling scream echoed out as the man died.To the other two clan members in the sixth level of Qi Condensation, Bai Xiaochun, with his bloodshot eyes and disheveled hair, looked like a wild beast. Their scalps began to tingle as he slowly turned to look at them. Without the slightest hesitation, they turned and fled.Off in the distance, Chen Yue was completely shaken by what had just occurred, and he could scarcely even believe what he had just witnessed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 54: Principles!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54: Principles!Seeing that the two cultivators in the sixth level of Qi Condensation were fleeing, Bai Xiaochun performed an incantation gesture, then waved his finger. His little wooden sword instantly flew through the air, slashing across the neck of one of the cultivators.His companion\u2019s eyes instantly shone with an unprecedented level of astonishment and terror.They were the ones who were supposed to be doing the chasing and killing, but now\u2026 the tables had turned, and they were being cut down!In a few short moments, Bai Xiaochun had already killed four people!The remaining cultivator in the sixth level of Qi condensation had an ashen face as he went all out to try to escape. His heart was pounding, and he was trembling all over. How could he ever have imagined that the slender, pure and fair Spirit Stream Sect disciple could\u2026 be so utterly terrifying?Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes shone with a savage gleam, and he was just about to give chase when, all of a sudden, a sensation of danger welled up in his heart.At the same time, Du Lingfei cried out urgently, \u201cWatch out!\u201dBai Xiaochun immediately leaped backward. In almost the exact same instant, a three-meter tall violet skull shot into the area where he had just been standing, then exploded.A boom rang out as the power of explodion blasted out, slamming into Bai Xiaochun. For the first time, his Undying Iron Skin felt pain, and blood even oozed out of his mouth as he flew backward.The person to attack him had been none other than Chen Yue, who was in the eighth level of Qi condensation.His expression was unsightly, and a very serious look could be seen in his eyes. After saving his fellow clan member from danger, he flashed through the air toward Bai Xiaochun. Behind him were two other cultivators, who were in the sixth level of Qi Condensation. They gritted their teeth and followed along.Three people were now charging toward Bai Xiaochun.Hou Yunfei wanted to help, but was simply too weak. The attack he had made earlier drained him of the last scrap of spiritual energy he had, and blood was currently seeping out of the corners of his mouth. Unfortunately, he was in no state to fight.Du Lingfei had been seriously injured, and as she anxiously watched Bai Xiaochun fighting, she realized that all of the previous hostility and prejudice she had felt toward him were long gone.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face was ashen as more blood oozed out of his mouth. He appeared to be on the verge of collapsing, and had seemingly lost much of the speed he had been capable of earlier. Seeing that, Chen Yue and his companions closed in for the kill.However, as they closed in, a brutal gleam appeared in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes. While it was true that his Undying Iron Skin couldn\u2019t completely block Chen Yue\u2019s attack moments ago, the truth was that it had absorbed the majority of the force of the attack. His current weak state, and even the blood oozing out of his mouth, were all an act.In the blink of an eye, he redoubled his speed. Furthermore, instead of retreating, he switched directions, passing Chen Yue toward his true target\u2026 the two Luochen clan members in the sixth level of Qi Condensation.Chen Yue\u2019s face flickered, and even as he made to block Bai Xiaochun\u2019s path, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s wooden sword shot toward him. Chen Yue performed an incantation gesture and pointed out, summoning the same skull from earlier. Rumbling sounds echoed out, but Chen Yue was incapable of stopping Bai Xiaochun.A fierce gleam appeared in Chen Yue\u2019s eyes, and he waved his sleeve, causing a lantern to materialize, which expanded out in a fireball that sped toward Bai Xiaochun.At the same time, the two weaker cultivators were crying out in shock and falling back in retreat. However, Bai Xiaochun moved as fast as lightning, and was almost instantly upon one of them, whereupon he reached out with his thumb and index finger, causing a flickering black glow to appear as he pinched his fingers together.Throat Crushing Grasp!The nearest Luochen Clan cultivator screamed, and then a cracking sound echoed out as his neck was crushed. At the same time, the blisteringly hot fireball was closing in on Bai Xiaochun from behind, and there was clearly no time for him to jump out of the way. Instantly, it slammed into him.A sea of flames exploded out, surrounding Bai Xiaochun, and causing both Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei to shout out in alarm: \u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201dFurther off, the surviving cultivator among the duo seemed delighted at the sight of Bai Xiaochun being consumed by the fire, and even started laughing.But then something barreled out from within the sea of flames to appear directly in front of that laughing cultivator. His eyes went wide, and before he could even retreat, Bai Xiaochun kicked down viciously, crushing the man\u2019s head into his torso. He didn\u2019t even have a chance to scream before he was completely dead.By this point, Bai Xiaochun was panting, and his eyes were even more shot with blood than before. Wounds riddled his body, and blood was oozing out of his mouth as he slowly looked up to glare at the last member of the Luochen Clan\u2026 Chen Yue!Being stared at in such a way caused Chen Yue\u2019s heart to prickle. His cultivation base was in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and he could be considered one of the Chosen in his clan. Although he didn\u2019t quite have the status of Crown Prince, he had the approval of the Patriarch and had experienced numerous deadly battles with beasts in the Fallenstar Mountains. Such deadly tempering had given him extraordinary battle prowess.As such, he completely looked down upon disciples of the Spirit Stream Sect. Although they far exceed him in terms of status, to him, cultivators from the big sects were like flowers in a flowerpot. Although they had extraordinary divine abilities, when it came to battles of life and death, they couldn\u2019t possibly match up to him.And yet now, Bai Xiaochun caused terror to well up inside of him. In fact, the moment that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes locked onto him, he felt more frightened than any time he had encountered a wild beast in the Fallenstar Mountains.That gaze contained a ferocity that seemed to wish to consume him alive, and caused coldness to spread out in Chen Yue\u2019s heart.When he thought about the fact that this person had slaughtered six of his fellow clan members in quick succession, he was completely and utterly shaken. In fact, what was most unbelievable of all was that this person\u2019s cultivation base\u2026 was merely in the great circle of the sixth level of Qi Condensation.\u201cHe\u2019s way too powerful and fast! He obviously cultivates some sort of body refinement magic, and has cultivated it to the level that he can kill people in one blow!\u201cFurthermore, his defenses are terrifying!\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any magical techniques, but his control over his flying sword is incredible. The sword not only moves with unimaginable speed, it\u2019s backed with astonishing power. And that wooden sword is definitely no ordinary item. It\u2019s obviously something so incredible it can kill someone in the sixth level of Qi Condensation!\u201cThis guy must be a famous Chosen from the Spirit Stream Sect. How come I\u2019ve never heard his name before? Bai Xiaochun!\u201d In his shock, Chen Yue felt a desire to fight burning within him. He waved his hand, causing three fist-sized jade skulls to fly out.His expression was very serious as he looked over at Bai Xiaochun.\u201cI underestimated you, but that\u2019s not going to happen again. Let\u2019s see which is more powerful, the magical techniques of your Spirit Stream Sect, or the killer ghouls of my Luochen Clan!\u201dEven as his words continued to echo out, Chen Yue performed an incantation gesture, causing the three skulls to suddenly begin to scream in very lifelike fashion. They also rapidly grew larger, until each one was fully three meters tall. Then, they all shot toward Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s breath came in ragged pants. His mind was a blank, devoid of any thinking. He had forgotten about the possibility of dying, and the only thing he had was the impulse to cut down his opponent.As the skulls closed in on him, he quickly performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, then waved his finger, sending his little wooden sword screaming out, to be joined by two other ordinary flying swords. Instantly, massive amounts of sword light filled the area as Bai Xiaochun began his charge.There was also a little shield which appeared and began to fly around him, radiating magical light.A moment later, Bai Xiaochun and his flying swords slammed into the skulls, causing massive rumbling sounds to echo out. Instantly, fierce fighting broke out between Bai Xiaochun and Chen Yue.Chen Yue was in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, with a cultivation base much more profound that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s. However, in terms of power and defense, as the two fought, it became obvious that they were about even.Waves of shock battered Du Lingfei\u2019s heart. She was so nervous that her hands were clenched into fists, and her fingernails dug painfully into her palms.The annoying Bai Xiaochun she remembered from the competition was nowhere to be seen. He had been replaced by someone with veins of steel, someone who was able to fight with Chen Yue of the Luochen Clan!\u201cI misjudged him\u2026. This is the real Bai Xiaochun\u2026.\u201cHe really is afraid of dying, but to come back and fight to the death like he has done takes far more courage than that possessed by most ordinary people\u2026.\u201d As she looked at Bai Xiaochun, Du Lingfei\u2019s eyes glowed with increased vigor.\u201cEven though he fears death, his heart is strong, and he has principles. Even if he is afraid of getting killed, he won\u2019t give up on his companions\u2026.\u201dEar-splitting booms rang out constantly. Before long, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s two ordinary flying swords were destroyed. Only his wooden sword remained. However, the three skulls were much dimmer than before, and were clearly significantly damaged as they flew back to Chen Yue.Bai Xiaochun took advantage of the opportunity that provided to launch another attack. Blood sprayed out of Chen Yue\u2019s mouth as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Throat Crushing Grasp latched onto his arm. Cracking sounds rang out as the bones were shattered. However, Chen Yue still managed to spit a tiny sword out of his mouth, which shot toward Bai Xiaochun and stabbed a full inch into his shoulder!Not even the Undying Iron Skin could stop it, and blood immediately began to flow. Chen Yue instantly shot backward, but before he could get very far, Bai Xiaochun, eyes bloodshot and completely disregarding his own injuries, gave chase at top speed.Chen Yue\u2019s face looked extremely unsightly as he clenched his jaw in the face of the deadly situation that was developing. He quickly performed an incantation gesture and then tapped his forehead, causing his entire body to tremble. Even as all of the qi and blood in his body began to surge violently, he slapped his hand down onto the crown of his head.\u201cBai Xiaochun, someone is going to die today, and it will be either me or you!\u201d On any other occasion, Chen Yue would have already ceased fighting. But this was a critical moment for his clan, and he knew that he had to kill Bai Xiaochun. He quickly spit out some of his life blood, which was voraciously consumed by the three skulls.\u201cGhoul Bloodbath!\u201d he howled as he unleashed his secret magic. The three skulls\u2019 eyes began to glow with mysterious light as they shot toward Chen Yue and began to madly chew away at his flesh and blood as they tried to burrow into his body.The bizarre sight caused Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei to gasp. Simultaneously, Chen Yue let out a miserable howl. His entire body was shaking, and his expression was completely vicious as a black fog roiled out from inside of him, transforming him into a three-meter-tall ghoul!\u201cDie!\u201d he roared, shoving his hand out as he shot toward Bai Xiaochun.\u201cYou\u2019ll be the one to die!\u201d Bai Xiaochun howled. His hands flashed in a double-handed incantation gesture, and then he pointed up into the air. Spiritual energy roiled madly out of him, shooting up into the air to form the shocking image of a cauldron!This was none other than\u2026Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Having having mastered the art of Lightness-in-Heaviness, she knew how difficult Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning was, and that on all of the south bank, only a few people could do it.Rumbling echoed out as the huge cauldron slammed into the ghoul. The ground quaked as it screamed and collapsed into numerous strands of black fog that roiled out in all directions, revealing Chen Yue.Blood sprayed out of his mouth as he slammed down onto the ground. Looking up bitterly at the huge cauldron, he murmured, \u201cViolet Qi\u2026 Cauldron Summoning\u2026.\u201dWith that, he struggled to turn his head to look one more time at Bai Xiaochun before passing away into death. The secret magic he had unleashed inflicted serious damage on his internal organs. That, coupled with a blow from the Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning that destroyed even the ghoul, ensured that he had no hope of surviving.Even as he died, his eyes were still staring at Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun looked at the dead Chen Yue, and then suddenly sagged in place. His internal spiritual energy had been vastly depleted, leaving him dizzy and as weak as a deflated balloon. He stood there, shivering, swaying back and forth, his face pale. He almost didn\u2019t dare to believe that he had actually killed all these people.As he thought back to the events which had just played out, he suddenly noticed a sweet taste, which was the blood oozing out of his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m bleeding\u2026\u201d he thought. \u201cI\u2026 I almost got killed!!\u201dEverywhere hurt, especially his shoulder. There were also numerous burns all over his body, which pulsed with pain. As Bai Xiaochun thought back to the fight, fear welled up within him, and he trembled.\u201cWhy\u2026 why did I come back? That\u2026 was so dangerous. I might have lost my little life\u2026. I, Bai Xiaochun, am always careful in everything I do. How could I have been so impulsive\u2026?\u201d Just as post-traumatic stress was about to hurl him into regret, something extremely soft and yet simultaneously firm leapt into his arms. He could feel curves, and could smell a delicate fragrance. It was none other than Du Lingfei.At first, he was surprised, but his expression quickly turned serious. Holding Du Lingfei tight, he calmly said, \u201cElder Sister Du, fear not. With Bai Xiaochun here, no one will be able to harm a hair on your head!\u201dEven as he spoke, his hand suddenly found itself resting on a soft, curved surface\u2026.\u201cThank you, thank you\u2026.\u201d she gushed emotionally, tears streaming down her face. It took her a moment to realize that somehow she was in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s arms. And then she realized what his hands were doing behind her, and her face reddened. She quickly backed up and looked at him angrily.Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat, savoring the sensation he had just experienced, and mused that Du Lingfei definitely deserved to be known as one of the top beauties on the south bank.A strange expression could be seen on Hou Yunfei\u2019s face. Clearing his throat, he smiled at Bai Xiaochun. \u201cJunior Brother Bai, we\u2019ll have time later to think about everything that has happened here. The Luochen Clan is definitely going to send more people to kill us, and this time it will most likely be the most powerful experts they have under the level of Foundation Establishment. We need to get out of here as quickly as possible.\u201dBai Xiaochun shivered. He had just used every trick he had at his disposal to beat these people. The mere thought of anyone showing up who was more powerful than Chen Yue caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face to grow pale. Looking at the chaos around him, he instantly nodded.\u201cYeah. Yeah, you\u2019re right, let\u2019s get out of here, as quickly as possible!\u201d With that, he instantly began to run away. He cut a very different image than the vicious fighter with veins of steel. However, this time, Du Lingfei didn\u2019t find it annoying, but actually rather charming. As she followed along, she thought back to the vicious fight he had gone through to rescue her, and the glow in her eyes grew stronger.Hou Yunfei shook his head. Quickly gathering up the Luochen Clan members\u2019 bags of holding, he caught up with Bai Xiaochun and handed them over.\u201cJunior Brother Bai, these are your spoils of war.\u201dBai Xiaochun threw them into his robe without even looking at them. As of this point, he couldn\u2019t stop shaking, and could only think of one thing: fleeing.**A short time ago\u2026.Back in the Fallenstar Mountains, in the Luochen Clan\u2019s necropolis, the lake of blood was surrounded by the various nodes that formed the spell formation. When the first Luochen Clan member fell to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand, one of those nodes collapsed, and the blood inside dried up.This scene caused the Luochen Clan members to stare in shock. However, before any of them could react, the same thing happened to a second node, then a third, a fourth and a fifth\u2026.Rumbling sounds echoed out continuously.The Luochen Clan was completely in shock, and one face after another fell. Then, the Patriarch in the middle of the lake of blood slowly opened his eyes.In that exact moment, a boom rang out from the node which Chen Yue had recently occupied.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that Chen Yue\u2026 was just killed!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re all dead. All seven people who were sent out have been killed!\u201d\u201cHow is this even possible? Weren\u2019t they going after two lowly Outer Sect disciples? Could it be that the Spirit Stream Sect knows about us, and sent a Foundation Establishment cultivator?!\u201d The Luochen Clan members couldn\u2019t suppress their shock, and a huge commotion instantly broke out, along with looks of fear and terror.\u201cPipe down!\u201d said an icy voice, which cut through all of the clamor. It was none other than the Foundation Establishment Patriarch. His voice echoed out like a thunderclap, causing the rest of the clan members to tremble and look nervously over at him.\u201cThe Heaven-defying chance to change our destiny, to expel the seal from within our blood, is a chance we will only come across once in a thousand years,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cSince the decision has been made, there is no need to let our imaginations run wild. If a Foundation Establishment cultivator had set foot into the security spell formation I have set up, I would have detected it. As of this moment\u2026 no Foundation Establishment cultivator has come, nor have any words been sent back. What are you people getting flustered for?\u201d An unsightly expression could be seen on his face; were it not for the fact that he had to maintain the spell formation, he would have personally gone out to wipe out Bai Xiaochun and the others.However, if he left, the Inverse Blood spell formation, which was the only way their clan could break free from the Spirit Stream Sect, would unleash a powerful backlash. Although he might be able to survive, the rest of the clan would find their blood flowing in reverse, and would die.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t necessarily take a Foundation Establishment cultivator to kill Chen Yue and his group. Those two Outer Sect disciples were either concealing the level of their cultivation bases, or have some sort of rare magical items!\u201cEven if they were concealing their cultivation bases, at the most, they might be at the eighth level of Qi Condensation. As for magical items\u2026 the more powerful they are, the harder they will be for Qi Condensation cultivators to use.\u201cHeng\u2019er!\u201d The old man\u2019s eyes glittered brightly as he slapped his hand down onto the surface of the lake of blood. Immediately, the blood began to ripple as a young man rose up from within, clad in a blood-red robe.He was exceedingly handsome, with chiseled features, and as soon as he opened his eyes, they glowed with the color of blood. Even as his energy surged up, nine blood-colored ghouls appeared around him, which emitted soundless howls.When the surrounding members of the Luochen Clan saw the young man, excited expressions could be seen on their faces, and they clasped hands and bowed their heads.When the Patriarch looked at the young man, his eyes gleamed with kindness and praise. His voice was soft as he said, \u201cHeng\u2019er, you are the Crown Prince of the Luochen Clan, and with a cultivation base of the ninth level of Qi Condensation, you are our most powerful expert next to me\u2026. You are well-qualified to handle this task. Take nine people with you\u2026 and kill all of the Outer Sect disciples of the Spirit Stream Sect!\u201dThe young man nodded, then coldly responded, \u201cI won\u2019t return until they\u2019re dead.\u201dHe leapt up, and the nine blood-colored ghouls transformed into a blood mist that lifted him up into the air. One by one, he nodded at nine other clan members, after which the ten of them left.Soon, ten figures were speeding out of the Luochen Clan mansion. The young man named Chen Heng then waved his hand, causing blood mists to appear beneath all of their feet, after which they flew off at top speed.They moved with incredible speed as they used a clan blood tracking technique to head toward the area where Chen Yue and the others had been killed.Chen Heng was in the ninth level of Qi Condensation. As for the rest of the group, five were in the same level as Chen Yue had been, the eighth level of Qi Condensation. The rest were in the seventh level.A squad like this was the most powerful force that the Luochen Clan could afford to send out at the moment.After enough time had passed for an incense stick to burn, Chen Heng and his group burst out of the jungle of the Fallenstar Mountains to appear in the location where Chen Yue and his group of seven had died.The shocking sight of all the corpses caused the faces of the other nine clan members to flicker.However, Chen Heng looked coldly at the corpses, and especially at those whose necks had been crushed, and his eyes began to shine with a mysterious light.\u201cA body refinement cultivator!\u201dHe suddenly flickered through the air to appear next to Chen Yue\u2019s corpse. After studying it thoughtfully for a few breaths of time, he reached down, pushed his hand onto the ground and closed his eyes. After a moment, his eyes opened.\u201cInteresting. I can sense the lingering fluctuations of Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning\u2026.\u201cThat means he simultaneously cultivates both magic and his body. With such shocking fleshly body power, and an impressive magical technique, it\u2019s no wonder he cut down Chen Yue and the others.\u201cHe must be one of the Chosen of the Spirit Stream Sect. Shangguan Tianyou perhaps? Or is he Lu Tianlei?\u201d A brutal gleam rose up in Chen Heng\u2019s eyes, within which flickered a deep desire to do battle.\u201cAll of you pick a different direction to search in,\u201d he said, his voice as cold as ice. \u201cOnce you track them down, send me a message immediately!\u201d With that, the others nodded in affirmation and then scattered in different directions.With a cold snort, Chen Heng picked a direction to begin searching, and flew off. \u201cThe security spell formation is vast. You won\u2019t be able to leave it for the next half month. You people\u2026 are dead!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Occasionally, they would make attempts to use their transmission jade slips, but never succeeded in making contact with the sect.Thankfully, they had plenty of medicinal pills. The seven Luochen Clan cultivators Bai Xiaochun had killed had all had bags of holding. Although the resources inside weren\u2019t at quite the same level as what was available in the Spirit Stream Sect, at a time like this, it was more than sufficient.With medicinal pills to bolster them, Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei were in high spirits. With their injuries under control, they managed to continue on through the entire night.Bai Xiaochun trembled in fear the entire time. The slightest breeze or rustling leaf would cause sweat to break out on his forehead. His heart felt tight, and his eyes were completely bloodshot. He was also still sore from the fighting, which often left him gritting his teeth from the pain.It wasn\u2019t that the pain was unendurable. Actually, it didn\u2019t measure up at all to the pain he had felt while cultivating the Undying Live Forever Technique. What bothered him was the actual sight of the blood and wounds, and the fear that they might worsen and eventually become life-threatening. He couldn\u2019t help but grimace in anxiety at the thought of it.Back before all of this had started, Du Lingfei would definitely have mocked him for that, and thought less of him than before. But now, everything was different, and a warm look could be seen in her eyes as she continuously comforted him.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t be scared, Junior Brother Bai. This wound looks bad, but it\u2019s not life-threatening.\u201cDon\u2019t move, I\u2019ll put some more medicinal ointment on it\u2026.\u201dSeeing Bai Xiaochun wince in pain despite the critical danger they were in caused Du Lingfei to secretly smile. Within that smile were numerous undefinable emotions.She knew how much Bai Xiaochun feared death, and it was that knowledge that left her so moved and shaken that he had returned. In fact, she even felt as if there were a superlative bravery lurking somewhere inside of him.That bravery could give birth to a figure with veins of steel, which was something she would never be able to forget.With Du Lingfei constantly comforting him, Bai Xiaochun started to feel more and more pleased with himself, and was starting to get the feeling that taking such a deadly risk had definitely been the right thing to do. After all, it had resulted in the beautiful Du Lingfei treating him so warmly all of a sudden.When Hou Yunfei saw what was happening, he looked on with smiling eyes. Considering that they were all fleeing for their lives together, it was only natural that warm feelings would develop between all of them, and that they would become closer.\u201cJunior Brother Bai, Junior Sister Du,\u201d he said, his tone serious, \u201cif we can make it back to the sect alive, then I\u2019ll remember this kindness you\u2019ve shown me, for the rest of my life!\u201d\u201cIf we can make it back\u2026?\u201d A look of longing appeared in Du Lingfei\u2019s eyes, but she quickly sighed and looked over at Bai Xiaochun. Pain rose up in her heart as she realized that the chances of the three of them getting back alive\u2026 were miniscule.Bai Xiaochun sank further into silence.Time passed. Two days went by, during which the three of them continued along with almost no rest. Repeated attempts to use their jade slips all ended in failure.Hou Yunfei\u2019s injuries were becoming more serious, as were Du Lingfei\u2019s, whose face was becoming more and more ashen. Gradually, even their mental faculties were degrading.Hou Yunfei sighed, turned to Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei and said, \u201cIt\u2019s too bad we can\u2019t just hide somewhere and weather the storm, but we really need to get word back to the sect. Of course, if my calculations are correct, the Luochen Clan\u2019s ceremony will be ending soon, and once that happens\u2026. their Foundation Establishment expert will be coming after us. No matter how we try to hide from him, we would be killed beyond the shadow of a doubt.\u201dIt was at this point that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face suddenly flickered. Grabbing Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei, he leaped into a nearby ditch and squatted down.Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei both had very serious expressions on their faces, and they immediately ceased any chatter.Before much time had passed, a beam of light appeared in the air up above, which was actually a blood mist. Within the mist was a Luochen Clan member in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, who was looking around carefully in all directions. However, because Bai Xiaochun had led the group into hiding, they weren\u2019t noticed, and the Luochen Clan member proceeded along into the distance.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart was pounding as he watched the cultivator disappearing. His eyes were completely bloodshot, and he almost wanted to jump out and attack the man. However, he couldn\u2019t do that unless he was certain that he could kill him. Otherwise, other members of the Luochen Clan might show up.\u201cThey\u2019ve caught up\u2026.\u201d said Du Lingfei, sighing. She looked over at Bai Xiaochun and hesitated, as if there were something she wanted to say to him. However, before she could, he grabbed her hand and started running again.The three of them said nothing as they proceeded along. They felt as if everything were weighing down on them, crushing down onto their hearts. The shadow of death loomed over them larger than ever, threatening to consume them completely.\u201cThere\u2019s still hope!\u201d Hou Yunfei suddenly said. \u201cAlthough the Patriarch of the Luochen Clan is a Foundation Establishment cultivator, far beyond us in terms of cultivation, his spell formation has to have limits. The Patriarch of my Hou Clan is also a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and I was once lucky enough to see a security spell formation that he set up. It could cover a distance of 5,000 kilometers, and required sealing certain spell nodes ahead of time.\u201dDu Lingfei\u2019s eyes gleamed as she responded, \u201cElder Brother Hou, do you mean that even though the spell formation was set up ahead of time by the Luochen Clan Patriarch, even if it exceeds 5,000 kilometers, it won\u2019t be by much?!\u201d\u201cExactly!\u201d Hou Yunfei declared. \u201cTherefore, the further away we get from the Luochen Clan, the greater the chances that our jade slips will work. If we can just get word back to the sect, they\u2019ll definitely send someone to save us!\u201d\u201c5,000 kilometers,\u201d Bai Xiaochun muttered, gritting his teeth. \u201cAt our current speed, that will take eight or nine more days to reach the border\u2026.\u201dAs they proceeded along, they were forced to hide on numerous occasions when Luochen Clan members neared. However, each time, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s uncanny ability to sense danger kept them safe.Considering how on guard he was, and the fact that he was pulling Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei along with him as they fled, Bai Xiaochun was getting more and more exhausted, his face more and more ashen.Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei\u2019s injures continued to worsen, and as a result, their speed suffered. It eventually reached the point where Bai Xiaochun was virtually carrying both of them.Bai Xiaochun was more cautious than ever as he led them along for three days straight.Three days of running and hiding left Bai Xiaochun more and more drained. His face was gaunt as he led the group into a valley. However, after taking only a few steps inside, his face flickered, and he pulled Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei off to the side, where they hid behind a boulder. Unfortunately, they were a bit too slow, and moments later they could hear the sound of someone whistling through the air toward them.A beam of white light descended from midair, slamming down into the rock they were hiding behind, completely shattering it. Hou Yunfei coughed up a mouthful of blood, and Du Lingfei couldn\u2019t prevent blood from oozing out of the corners of her mouth. A cold snort rang out through the air.\u201cSo, here\u2019s where you\u2019ve been hiding!\u201dA Luochen Clan cultivator appeared, standing on a blood mist. He was in the seventh level of Qi Condensation, and held a mirror in his left hand. As soon as he saw them, he slapped his bag of holding and produced a jade slip. Just when he was about to transmit some information, Hou Yunfei cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t let him make contact!\u201dThe ashen-faced Du Lingfei was just about to unleash a flying sword when Bai Xiaochun, who had been slowly backing up, gritted his teeth and stopped in place. Eyes bloodshot, knees quivering, he focused his qi and blood, and then the ground beneath his feet shattered as he launched himself into the air, turning into a beam of light.Even as the Luochen Clan cultivator was about to transmit the information, Bai Xiaochun burst toward him with incredible speed. The cultivator\u2019s face fell, and he fell back, unable to successfully make contact. Performing an incantation gesture, he swung the mirror with his left hand, causing a beam of light to shoot toward Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes glittered with a ferocious light; instead of dodging, he allowed the white light to slam into him. His charge carried him forward toward the shocked Luochen Clan cultivator, whereupon he reached out with his right hand, touching his thumb and index finger together. A black light shot out and latched onto the cultivator\u2019s throat.Throat Crushing Grasp!A cracking sound rang out, and the cultivator\u2019s eyes went wide. Blood oozed out of his mouth, and he toppled over dead, the message to his fellow clan members unsent.Blood was also oozing out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth as he collected up the enemy\u2019s bag of holding, then walked back over to Du Lingfei. There, he trembled and almost fell to the ground, but gritted his teeth and managed to stay on his feet.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d he said, pulling Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei along.\u201cLet go of me!\u201d Hou Yunfei said. \u201cYou two go. Without me, you\u2019ll be a bit faster.\u201dHis gaze was one of determination as he looked at Bai Xiaochun and Du Lingfei.Du Lingfei looked deeply at Bai Xiaochun, and suddenly said something she had been contemplating saying for the past few days. \u201cJunior Brother Bai, why don\u2019t you go alone\u2026?\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dBai Xiaochun yelled. \u201cI\u2019m scared of dying, but I\u2019m risking my life. There\u2019s no way you two are going to make that sacrifice mean nothing! Come, let\u2019s go! Together!\u201d Not giving them any chance to speak further, he pulled the two of them along. Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei didn\u2019t say anything further, but they were more moved than ever.Bai Xiaochun was extremely cautious as he led them forward, constantly changing directions, and being careful to avoid the Luochen Clan cultivators when they got close. Three more days passed. It was evening, and the occasional bolt of lightning danced across the sky. Black clouds were forming, and rain began to fall, great bead-sized drops that caused splashing sounds to fill the air.It started to get very cold, causing Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei to shiver; their faces were only getting more ashen. Nervousness clutched at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart. Knowing that the other two wouldn\u2019t be able to survive in such bitter cold, he found a cave in a mountain, where he started a fire.After sealing the entrance of the cave to make sure the light of the fire didn\u2019t seep out, he sat down cross-legged across from Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei.The fire hissed and popped, and let off enough heat to gradually dispel the cold. A bit of color gradually returned to the faces of Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei, although they still looked very pale.The three of them sat silently in the cave, watching the fire, and stewing in anxiety.Finally, Bai Xiaochun chuckled and broke the silence, \u201cIn three more days, we should be able to pass that 5,000 kilometer mark. Hahaha! Just wait until we get back to the sect. This is definitely going to count as a big meritorious service. I wonder what reward we\u2019ll get?\u201dDu Lingfei looked at him, her gaze soft.Hou Yunfei was about to laugh, but as soon as he opened his mouth, he coughed up some blood, and his face paled as he swayed on the verge of collapse.After all the days of running, they had long since run out of medicinal pills.Bai Xiaochun rose to his feet and was just about to go over and examine Hou Yunfei, when suddenly his face flickered. He waved his sleeve out to protect his two friends as the stone he had rolled into place to block the firelight suddenly exploded!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As Bai Xiaochun waved the shrapnel aside, cold air came rushing in. The fire danced, its flickering light revealing a tall, sturdily built man standing outside.He was muscular, with icy eyes, and a long spear in hand. He was in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and seemed to be even stronger than Chen Yue had been.\u201cThe Crown Prince was dead on,\u201d he said. \u201cWith rain like this and injuries like yours, you couldn\u2019t handle the cold, and were forced to find a place like this to hide. I had to search over a hundred mountains before I found you, but here you are.\u201dEven as the words were still leaving the man\u2019s mouth, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes blazed with ferocity as he leaped into action. Although the burly man seemed like the impulsive type, he was actually quite cautiou. Instead of charging into the cave to fight, he actually fell back.In the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun was out of the cave and in the pouring rain.Clearly, the burly man didn\u2019t intend to actually fight, and was focused completely on defense. That caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart to begin to thump. He was getting a very bad feeling, and yet he gritted his teeth and ignored any possibility of injury as he charged forward in a mad attack.A gust of frigid wind blew into the cave, extinguishing the fire. Hou Yunfei tried to struggle to his feet, but then coughed up another mouthful of blood. Du Lingfei gritted her teeth and hobbled to the mouth of the cave, where she performed an incantation gesture and pointed out, sending a flying sword shooting toward the burly man.A moment later, a bloodcurdling scream echoed out into the stormy night. The burly man had been stabbed through the chest by a wooden sword, and yet, in the moment before dying, he hurled his spear out, which partially stabbed into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s right thigh.The burly man glared at Bai Xiaochun. Groaning, he said, \u201cYou won\u2019t get away! The Crown Prince will be here soon!\u201dThen he coughed up a mouthful of blood, and his head slumped over in death.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face was pale, and he was trembling. In order to kill the man as quickly as possible, he had drawn upon so much energy that his injuries had worsened. Pain radiated up his right leg, and when he looked down, he saw the spear still imbedded into his flesh. He was also soaked with rainwater, which intermixed with the blood to flow down onto the ground. He felt half frozen to death.Du Lingfei staggered over, and when she saw his leg, she began to weep. She reached out, grabbed hold of the spear, and gingerly pulled it out of his leg.To Bai Xiaochun, it felt as if his flesh and bones were being ripped apart. He trembled, but held back from shouting out. The dying words of his opponent, plus the fact that the man had obviously been trying to buy time, caused his heart to sink even lower than before.He could even sense fluctuations in the wind that told him it wouldn\u2019t be very long before more pursuing members of the Luochen Clan showed up.Du Lingfei threw his arm over her shoulder, and the two of them managed to get back into the cave. Bai Xiaochun kept the spear. Back in the cave, Bai Xiaochun began to pant. His right leg hurt, but thankfully the spear hadn\u2019t stabbed into the bone. After binding the wound, he could still feel it, but considering the mortal danger they were in, it wasn\u2019t a major issue.\u201cWe need to go. The Luochen Clan could show up at any moment!\u201d Taking a deep breath, Bai Xiaochun slowly rose to his feet.He looked down at Hou Yunfei, and saw him laying there, struggling for breath. Their days of flight had been like a torment, and he was losing his ability to keep his injuries under control. Du Lingfei was sallow and wan. Her qi passageways had been severely injured, and some had even been severed. It had been an incredible struggle for her to emerge and help Bai Xiaochun in the fight earlier, and now all she could do was look up at him.In the darkness of the stormy night, her eyes seemed especially beautiful.\u201cJunior Brother Bai\u2026.\u201d she said softly. \u201cForget about us. You\u2019re much faster on your own\u2026. GO!\u201d Off to the side, Hou Yunfei struggled into a sitting position. Looking exhaustedly at Bai Xiaochun, he nodded in agreement.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were bloodshot as he said,\u201cWe can get out of the 5,000 kilometer area in only three days, guys, shut your m\u2013\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, Hou Yunfei cut him off. \u201cJunior Brother Bai, you escaping and getting word to the sect is the best chance Junior Sister Du and I have\u2026.\u201dBai Xiaochun laughed bitterly. He was no three-year-old child to believe a lie like that. He knew that even if he did escape and get word to the sect, by the time anyone arrived to help\u2026 Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei would already be dead.Seeing that Bai Xiaochun seemed determined to stay, Hou Yunfei started laughing. \u201cFine. If I die, then you\u2019ll leave, right?\u201dA tremor ran through Bai Xiaochun as he realized that Hou Yunfei was stirring his last bit of spiritual energy as if to destroy his own qi passageways.Hou Yunfei looked at him calmly and continued, \u201cJunior Brother Bai, are you going to go, or not?!\u201dBai Xiaochun was miserable and heartbroken. He took a few steps backward, mixed emotions on his face as he stared at Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei.A gust of wind blew a strand of Du Lingfei\u2019s hair across her face. She tucked it behind her ear and looked at Bai Xiaochun. Although her face was ashen, somehow, she looked even more beautiful than ever. Her voice soft, she murmured, \u201cI hope\u2026 if there\u2019s another life after this one\u2026 that I\u2019ll have the chance to meet you again\u2026. Junior Brother Bai\u2026 you have to stay alive!\u201dThe instant Bai Xiaochun heard the words 'stay alive,\u201d a violent tremor ran through him, and he felt as if he had been struck in the chest by a hammer. Taking another long look at Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei, he finally turned and walked out of the cave, unsure of what exactly he was feeling inside. A moment later, he was speeding through the stormy night.Seeing that Bai Xiaochun had finally chosen to leave, Hou Yunfei let out a soft sigh. Du Lingfei watched him leave, wishing him the best in her heart. She truly wished\u2026 that she could make time flow in reverse, that she could return back to the time\u2026 when she had first met Bai Xiaochun.Everything was quiet for a moment, but then Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei suddenly looked out in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction, and their faces flickered.His cultivation base was erupting with power, his internal spiritual energy surging outward, even causing the rainwater to distort.He was like a brightly burning torch on a dark night that not even the coldness brought by the rain could dispel. Even someone very far away would be able to sense it.Lightning snaked across the sky as Luochen Clan cultivators from several different directions suddenly sensed Bai Xiaochun.Chen Heng\u2019s eyes glittered as he looked in the direction of the upsurge of power.Bai Xiaochun flickered into motion, flying up the mountainside past the cave. As he flew by, Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei could hear him whispering something to them.\u201cI\u2019ll get their attention. You two find a way to escape\u2026 Come on, go!\u201dTears began to stream down Du Lingfei\u2019s face as her heart was battered by incredible waves of emotion. Hou Yunfei was likewise shaken.At the same time, Bai Xiaochun burst out with incredible speed as he picked a different direction to flee in.Bai Xiaochun sped along, cackling madly and crying out at the top of his lungs, \u201cDead! They\u2019re dead! Luochen Clan, I can\u2019t wipe all of you out, but the Spirit Stream Sect will definitely come and kill you all!\u201dHe appeared to be heading in a direction which would quickly lead out of the 5,000 kilometer area. Furthermore, from the way he was yelling, it seemed obvious that his two compatriots were dead, and that he was hysterical. Even if he might die in the attempt, he would break out and pass word to the sect, to make sure that revenge was had.Chen Heng instantly realized what was happening, and his face flickered. Although he couldn\u2019t be sure whether or not Bai Xiaochun was putting on an act, he could tell that, based on his current speed, he could succeed. Chen Heng definitely didn\u2019t dare to gamble with the fate of his sect by ignoring the threat.He immediately transmitted a message to the other Luochen Clan cultivators. \u201cEveryone kill him! Even if his friends aren\u2019t dead, they\u2019re definitely seriously injured. We can track them down after we kill this one!\u201dAll of the Luochen Clan cultivators shot through the rain at top speed toward Bai Xiaochun.Lightning crashed and rain fell. Back in the darkness of the cave in the mountain, Du Lingfei gritted her teeth and wiped the tears off of her cheeks. Then, her eyes began to glow with determination.She knew that the only way to save Bai Xiaochun was to escape the 5,000 kilometer area and get word back to the sect.She looked over at Hou Yunfei, whose eyes flickered with the same determination as hers.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s split up. Whichever of us gets out first can bring help from the sect to save Junior Brother Bai!\u201d Hou Yunfei was determined to use his last bit of energy to try to break out and get help for Bai Xiaochun, even if he died in the process.The two of them took deep breaths and then ran out into the rain, splitting up and heading in two different directions, calling upon all the strength they could manage. They were already on the verge of collapsing, but by sheer force of willpower, they managed to exceed the limits of their bodies.Thunder boomed and lightning fell. Bai Xiaochun was speeding along as fast as he could. He had already lost sensation in his right leg, and his eyes were crimson. A sensation of deadly crisis thrummed in every inch of his body.He was scared, terrified of dying, certain that death was right on his heels, on the very brink of swallowing him up.He wasn\u2019t sure if his actions just now had been impulsive or not, or whether or not he might regret his decision. After all, the purpose of Immortal cultivation was to live forever.In fact, there was still a voice in his head telling him\u2026 to run away on his own\u2026.However, he couldn\u2019t forget the feeling of what it was like to be struggling with his two friends to survive. That feeling of facing the danger as a team was something he couldn\u2019t get rid of. He couldn\u2019t forget how Hou Yunfei had threatened to kill himself to get Bai Xiaochun to leave, nor the beautiful smile on Du Lingfei\u2019s ashen face.If he could only pick fear of death, or loyalty to friends, he would pick the latter!\u201cElder Sister Du, Elder Brother Hou, you have to stay alive!\u201d Gritting his teeth, he flew onward with reckless abandon. \u201cYou want to wipe us out, Luochen Clan? Alright, bring it on!\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes glowed with savage fury, like a caged animal ready to fight for its life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The world was a mix of darkness and light, filled with rumbling booms and the sound of raindrops smacking onto the ground.From a distance, everything seemed to be a haze of rain, completely somber and desolate.Bai Xiaochun trembled as he sped forward with all the speed he could muster. He flew along, feet pounding the ground, occasionally leaping into the air over some obstacle. He was like an arrow loosed from the bowstring, whistling through the air.\u201cHave to stay alive,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou guys\u2026 have to stay alive!\u201d That was what he kept repeating to himself as the images of Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei continued to flash in his mind.The shadow of death loomed, fusing with the rain, making everything around him seem even colder than usual.By this point, roughly nine figures were speeding toward him from various directions. The furthest person away from him was Chen Heng, but he was also the fastest. He was like a beam of light stabbing through the sheets of rain, moving faster and faster, causing rumbling sounds to echo out.\u201cYou can\u2019t escape! Nobody can escape from our Patriarch\u2019s spell formation!\u201d Killing intent flickered in Chen Heng\u2019s eyes.He had never imagined that three Outer Sect disciples of the Spirit Stream Sect would manage to evade him for so many days, and in fact, even get close to the border of the spell formation set up by his Patriarch. As for the disciple they were currently closing in on, he had a profound cultivation base, sufficient to not only strike down Chen Yue, but numerous other members of the Luochen Clan.He was now more convinced than ever that this person was one of the famous Chosen from the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect, either Shangguan Tianyou or Lu Tianlei. After all, when it came to the affairs of the south bank, the north bank usually wouldn\u2019t interfere.\u201cSpirit Stream Sect Chosen\u2026.\u201d Chen Heng thought, eyes glittering with killing intent, and even a spark of amusement.Rumbling thunder filled the air as Bai Xiaochun sped along with gritted teeth. He was panting, and his internal spiritual energy was fading quickly. Because of the rain, it was hard to see anything, and he almost felt as if some primordial ancient beast had swallowed up Heaven and Earth.Suddenly, Bai Xiaochun looked up with bloodshot eyes, looking fiercely at certain fluctuations in the rainwater a few dozen meters up ahead. Popping sounds rang out as countless raindrops then exploded and shot toward Bai Xiaochun.Behind that sheet of rain was the first Luochen Clan member who had arrived to intercept Bai Xiaochun!He was a middle-aged man, and the ugly scar which ran down his face made him look extremely ferocious. On top of that, he had a cultivation base in the great circle of the seventh level of Qi Condensation. He shot toward Bai Xiaochun, hefting a gigantic battle-axe in his right hand. As he closed in, he gripped the haft of the axe with both hands, lifted it high into the air, and swung it down viciously toward Bai Xiaochun!\u201cYou\u2019re not going one step further!\u201d the man barked, his voice booming like thunder.Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t hesitate for even a moment. As the axe descended, he shot forward, shooting his left hand out toward the axe itself!The middle-aged man laughed coldly, pouring more cultivation base power into his hands, causing the axe to scream madly through the air toward Bai Xiaochun.In the instant that Bai Xiaochun extended his left hand, a black flicker of light could be seen as his Undying Iron Skin was unleashed. Even as his left hand made contact with the axe head, it turned completely pitch black.A boom rang out as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s left hand clamped onto the axe with such incredible force that the surrounding rainwater began to vibrate, and then exploded into a haze.Pain exploded out within him, and blood flowed, and yet the power of his Undying Iron Skin kept his hand safe, albeit injured.The middle-aged man frowned, then tried to jerk his axe away. However, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s grip was like an iron vice that kept the giant axe completely locked down; no matter how the middle-aged man struggled, he couldn\u2019t move it even a teeny bit.The man\u2019s face flickered, and then he looked up and realized that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were blazing with flames of madness!It was a madness that this man had only ever seen within the eyes of various wild beasts in the Fallenstar Mountains.The man\u2019s heart instantly began to pound, and in the blink of an eye, the glow of defensive shields sprang up around him. Without any hesitation, he let go of the axe and fell back.He was fast, but\u2026 Bai Xiaochun was faster!Even as his left hand maintained its grip on the axe, his right hand flared with black light, and simultaneously shot out toward the middle-aged man.His hand pierced through the man\u2019s defensive shields, causing cracking sounds to ring out as one layer after another was destroyed. Bai Xiaochun cut through them like a razor-sharp blade through bamboo. At the same time, because of the current state Bai Xiaochun was in, his Throat Crushing Grasp suddenly did something it had never done before.Unexpectedly\u2026 a gravitational force appeared, causing the middle-aged man to lurch to a stop. Before he could even react, his entire world was completely superseded by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s pitch-black hand!A boom rang out as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand clamped onto the man\u2019s throat and then clenched down hard!CRACK!A flicker of disbelief passed through the man\u2019s eyes, and then blood oozed out of his mouth. There was no time for him to scream as the bones in his neck were crushed. Then, his head sagged to the side. He was dead!Disbelief could still be seen in his eyes. Although he had been aware that the person they were chasing was powerful, and had even been prepared going into the fight, the blow he had unleashed moments ago had not been a lethal one. He had only been trying to stop Bai Xiaochun and buy some time. How could he ever have imagined that this skinny Outer Sect disciple of the Spirit Stream Sect would be so utterly powerful?In the moment that the man died, two more figures appeared off in the distance. Shockingly, one of them had a cultivation base in the eighth level of Qi Condensation!Seeing their dead comrade in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand, they let out roars of rage. \u201cChen Zhong!!\u201d\u201cYou people are forcing me to do this!\u201d Bai Xiaochun growled. He tossed the corpse aside, then quickly changed directions and shot off at top speed. He was shaking, panting, and yet, his eyes gleamed with an even more intensely brutal light than before.He knew that he couldn\u2019t afford to stop for even a moment. After all, the whole crux of his plan was to get the Luochen Clan members to follow him. As he changed directions, he could see a sprawling mountain range off in the distance.Because that particular mountain range wasn\u2019t a specific border region, it didn\u2019t have a name. It was a separate mountain range than the Fallenstar Mountains, but was comparable in size, and in fact, perhaps even a bit larger. The rain there fell at a steep angle, and the entire area was crashing with lightning.In fact, when Bai Xiaochun looked over, the lightning seemed to mass into a sphere which then exploded out into the rain.Bai Xiaochun sped in the direction of the mountain range, the two Luochen Clan members hot on his trail. At the same time, more cultivators were closing in.There was even a bright beam of light which was none other than Chen Heng, who was getting closer by the moment.As the Luochen Clan cultivators closed the distance to Bai Xiaochun, he got closer and closer to the tree-covered mountains. He was now several dozen meters away, completely soaked as he ran along. As of this moment, he was on the verge of making it into the jungle itself.\u201cStop him!\u201d Chen Heng said grimly.The cultivator closest to Bai Xiaochun was in the eighth level of Qi Condensation. He let out a roar, then reached out and grabbed the Qi Condensation seventh level clan member next to him. They exchanged a glance, and were instantly thinking the same thing. The Qi Condensation seventh level clan member curled up into a ball, and then the other clan member hurled him forward as hard as possible.Rumbling sounds filled the air as he called upon all the power of his cultivation base to propel his companion through the air. The second cultivator shot through the rain with explosive speed, and in the blink of an eye, was right upon Bai Xiaochun.As he closed in, he unleashed his cultivation base, causing thunderous rumbling sounds to echo out. Bai Xiaochun lurched to a stop, spun, and performed an incantation gesture. The wave of a finger sent his wooden sword flying out, and yet the Luochen Clan cultivator actually allowed it to stab into him. Even as he passed away into death, a bizarre smile appeared on his face.Suddenly, he exploded into a cloud of blood and gore that then transformed into a rope of blood that began to entangle Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face fell, and he turned to flee. However, in that moment of distracted retreat, a screaming sound rose up from behind him, which was an arrow!That arrow had been shot from none other than the cultivator in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, who currently held a quivering bow in his hand.The sacrifice of the other cultivator led to a critical moment in which Bai Xiaochun was incapable of dodging!Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered. Stopping in place, he suddenly shot directly toward the speeding arrow.A boom rang out as the arrow stabbed into Bai Xiaochun, causing an explosion of pain that left him pale-faced.The arrow pierced the bone in his shoulder, shattering it. The arrow itself was made from extraordinary materials, and backed by the power of the eighth level of Qi Condensation, making it incredibly strong. After snapping the bone, it actually sent the skinny Bai Xiaochun flying through the air past the blood rope!THUMP!The arrow slammed into a nearby tree, simultaneously impaling Bai Xiaochun!Delight flickered in the eyes of the cultivator in the eighth level of Qi Condensation. He then flickered into motion, shooting forward and preparing to unleash a second arrow to cut down Bai Xiaochun!The other Luochen Clan cultivators had brutal grins on their faces as they closed in. However, it was in this moment that Chen Heng\u2019s expression suddenly flickered.\u201cWatch out!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 59: You Die, I Live!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59: You Die, I Live!In almost the same moment that Chen Heng\u2019s voice echoed out, Bai Xiaochun, who was still pinned to the tree, looked up. A valiant gleam appeared in his eyes as he reached up, grabbed the arrow which was protruding from his shoulder, then viciously pulled it out, ignoring the stabbing pain that resulted.Blood spurted out, and the arrow itself dragged out chunks of flesh. The pain itself was so intense that Bai Xiaochun trembled. And yet, without the slightest hesitation, he unleashed the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art. Using Heaviness-in-Lightness, he flung the arrow back at the Luochen Clan cultivator.A piercing scream echoed through the air as the arrow accelerated rapidly.Because of the use of Heaviness-in-Lightness, the force of the arrow was like a towering mountain.At the same time, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hands flashed in an incantation gesture, sending his wooden sword flying out in a second deadly attack. A somber, bleak aura raged; his successive deadly encounters with the members of the Luochen Clan had provided Bai Xiaochun with incredible hands-on experience in battle. Furthermore, it showed that he seemed to have incredible talent as a fighter hidden deep in his bones, something he rarely revealed to the world. It was only on display now because of the numerous life-and-death situations he had faced.The Luochen Clan cultivator who had been just about to fire a second arrow was taken aback. He had never imagined that Bai Xiaochun could be so vicious. In fact, now he realized that Bai Xiaochun might very well have intentionally let himself be struck with the arrow, all with the purpose of being able to make this almost instant counter-attack.The man fell back instantly. He was in the great circle of the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and as someone who frequently fought various dangerous beasts in the Fallenstar Mountains, was very experienced. He knew that he had lost the initiative in the fighting, but even as he retreated, he chose not to activate any defenses. Instead, he took advantage of the brief moment he had\u2026 to finish drawing the bow!\u201cAre you gonna block this one?!\u201d he roared, a vicious gleam in his eyes as he launched a second arrow.In his estimation, Bai Xiaochun would definitely use his wooden sword to block the arrow, which would eliminate one of the two deadly threats which were heading his way, and would give him back the initiative.However, it was in this very moment that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes turned bright red; he knew that he couldn\u2019t give his opponent even the slightest opportunity to make a move. If he did, then he would most likely be killed.Gritting his teeth, he decided not to use the wooden sword in defense, and instead allowed the arrow to close in and stab into his abdomen. At the same time, the arrow he had thrown rocketed forward and pierced into the man\u2019s chest. Blood sprayed everywhere as the man screamed, his eyes shining with surprise as the force of the blow shoved him backward even faster.That was when Bai Xiaochun\u2019s wooden sword bore down on the man as though it demanded to end his life. With a swift slashing motion, it completely severed the man\u2019s head, which toppled down to the ground.Having accomplished these things, Bai Xiaochun coughed up a mouthful of blood, and yet didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment to race into the cover of the trees, whereupon he vanished.After a few dozen breaths of time passed, numerous other Luochen Clan cultivators arrived on the scene. As they looked around, expressions of shock appeared on their faces as they realized that Bai Xiaochun was so vicious that he would even injure himself to slay his opponent.A moment later, a flash of light could be seen as Crown Prince Chen Heng appeared.He looked at the severed head of his fellow clan member, and then at the other traces of blood in the area. His expression turned grim, and fierce killing intent radiated out from him.Also in the area were five other clan members, three of whom were in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and two being in the seventh.\u201cChen Feng, Chen Gu, the two of you go search for the others. We can\u2019t let ourselves be drawn out of our territory. The rest of you\u2026 you\u2019re coming with me. We\u2019re bringing back this guy\u2019s head!\u201d With that, Chen Heng flicked his sleeve and headed into the trees.The two who were in the seventh level of Qi Condensation complied with Chen Heng\u2019s orders and resumed their searching. The other three followed Chen Heng into the trees, eyes flickering with the desire to kill.Within the jungle that covered the nameless mountain range, Bai Xiaochun proceeded along, dizzy and vision blurred. His shoulder, his abdomen, and his right leg were all seriously injured. Because of the cold brought by the rain, he was shivering even more violently than he would have normally been.\u201cAm I gonna die\u2026?\u201d he thought, chuckling bitterly. The sight of all his injuries, and the bone-stabbing pain that came along with them, caused tears to well up in his eyes.He suddenly recalled an image of his parents, lying sick on their deathbeds. Then he remembered how he had watched their bodies slowly growing colder in death.Perhaps that was when he had started to especially fear the idea of dying.\u201cI want to live!\u201d he thought. He wiped the tears off of his face with his left arm, then gritted his achingly cold teeth as he sped along through the jungle. He had no idea where exactly he was, nor did he have a plan about what to do. There was only one thought in his head. \u201cI have to stay alive!\u201dIt was actually his fear of death which seemed to give him unending power, and kept him going as he sped along through the stormy night.Gradually, he came to realize that after all the fighting, his cultivation base was stirring, and he was actually not very far away from breaking through to the seventh level of Qi Condensation.Eventually, the sun became visible off in the distance, and as the rays of light pierced through the leaves, they reflected off of the falling raindrops, creating a beautiful scene.Chen Heng and the other three Luochen Clan cultivators were following him at top speed. Chen Heng\u2019s face was growing increasingly unsightly as he realized that their quarry, despite being so seriously wounded, was moving so quickly through the jungle that they weren\u2019t making any headway in catching up. After following him for an entire night, they still had no idea exactly where he was.Furthermore, the rain ensured that the evidence of his passage was quickly washed away. Despite the fact that they were from a cultivator clan in the Fallenstar Mountains, who frequently hunted beasts in the jungle, they were still unable to track him.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s split up,\u201d Chen Heng said through gritted teeth. \u201cHe\u2019s wounded, so he won\u2019t be able to run for long. The three of you, stay about three hundred meters apart. When you find him, don\u2019t engage! Send me a message immediately!\u201d With that, the other three clan members nodded and headed off in different directions.Time passed. The next day, Bai Xiaochun was completely worn out, and was reaching his limit. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was running for his life, he would have long since collapsed.His lips were parched and cracked, his face haggard, his pace slowing. After proceeding for the time it takes an incense stick to burn, his face suddenly flickered as he saw a blur of motion to the right. However, no one attacked him. Instead, the figure fell back immediately.It was a long-faced young man, one of the three Luochen Clan members who had fanned out to search for him. Even as the young man fell back, he pulled out a jade slip which he pressed down onto to send a message.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face sank, and he pushed onward into the jungle even faster than before.The long-faced young man watched him go. Bai Xiaochun frightened him, and even as he debated whether or not to give chase immediately, he saw two figures speeding toward him from off in the distance, and his expression brightened.Those were the two other clan members, and further off in the distance, he could even see Chen Heng.Based on how fast they were moving, the two other clan members would arrive in about ten breaths of time. Chen Heng was a bit further away, and would need roughly twenty breaths to arrive.The long-faced young man began to laugh heartily. Without any further hesitation, he powered up his cultivation base, simultaneously summoning numerous shield layers. He also slapped his bag of holding to produce a long sword.It was a greatsword, over two meters long, with an ancient and crude appearance. The young man hefted it, and then swung it through the air, causing whistling sounds to ring out from the sharpness of the blade. Killing intent flickered in his eyes, and he smiled viciously as he shot after Bai Xiaochun at top speed.\u201cKilling a Chosen from the Spirit Stream Sect is definitely going to be fun! Much funner than killing random rogue cultivators!\u201d Laughing, he slashed the sword through the air, causing a beam of sword light to fly out, accompanied by a sound like rushing wind. He then performed an incantation gesture with his left hand and pointed his finger out, causing a fist-sized fireball to shoot in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction.Despite the falling rain, the fireball exploded with scorching heat as it shot through the air. A tremor ran through Bai Xiaochun, and when he turned to look back, killing intent flickered in his eyes. He was well aware that if he didn\u2019t take out this opponent immediately, it would be impossible for him to escape.However, in the moment that Bai Xiaochun turned, the long-faced young man suddenly fell back, eyes flickering with derision. There was absolutely no way he was going to give Bai Xiaochun the chance to get close to him. His only goal at the moment was simply to buy time.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hands clenched into fists, and he began to run again. However, the long-faced young man quickly interfered, delaying him again. A few breaths of time passed, and the other two clan members were closing in. When they saw Bai Xiaochun, their cultivation bases flared with power.At the same time, the long-faced young man began to laugh. Instead of dancing around like he had been, he unleashed all the speed he could muster. Along with his two fellow clan members, he shot murderously toward Bai Xiaochun.Three cultivation bases at the eighth level of Qi Condensation. When Chen Heng saw the killing attack being unleashed, he felt a bit more at ease. He was quite confident that, no matter what tricks Bai Xiaochun pulled, he would definitely be killed.\u201cWhat a pity,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cHe won\u2019t even have a chance to grow up.\u201d However, before he could even blink his eyes, his expression flickered.Even as the three figures closed in on Bai Xiaochun, unleashing various deadly divine abilities and magical techniques, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s right hand flashed with an incantation gesture. His wooden sword flew out toward the middle opponent, and he threw out a punch toward another.A boom rang out as the wooden sword was blocked. However, the fist strike landed, sending its target tumbling back, blood spraying out of his mouth. Bai Xiaochun also coughed up blood as his injuries worsened. However, before he could retreat, the long-faced youth closed in and slashed out with his long sword, sending a blast of sword light toward Bai Xiaochun.In the moment of critical danger, Bai Xiaochun barely managed to twist his body to avoid a blow to the heart. The blade stabbed into him, instantly causing sweat to break out all over his body. He shivered, and at the same time, the long-faced young man began to laugh. Then, just when he was about to pull the sword back, Bai Xiaochun reached out and grabbed the blade, then yanked himself forward down to the hilt.It was a heavy price to pay, but it put him directly in front of the long-faced young man, whose scalp was tingling so hard it felt like it might explode. A sudden feeling of intense, deadly crisis washed over him. Just when he was about to drop the blade and jump backward, black light appeared on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s right hand as he grabbed the young man\u2019s neck.\u201cYou\u2013\u201d the young man said, eyes widening. Before he could say another word\u2026A cracking sound rang out!His neck was crushed!\u2014\u2013Note from Deathblade: As I gear up to do the final burst of chapters for I Shall Seal the Heavens, every minute I have here and there is precious.

In the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint, the number of cultivators who were in the eighth level of Qi Condensation was reduced from three to two. The remaining two gasped, but had little time to ponder the matter, and continued to charge toward Bai Xiaochun.Blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth as he flew back, slamming into a tree and simultaneously pulling the greatsword out of his chest. He quickly slashed the sword out at one of the two remaining opponents. However, his target nimbly dodged to the side, allowing his companion to close in, whereupon his right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and incredible power exploded out.A boom echoed out as Bai Xiaochun was sent flying through the air, blood spraying everywhere. His clothes were now completely soaked with blood as the two Luochen Clan cultivators bore down on him. It seemed like a no-win situation, but Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t given in to despair yet; he desperately wanted to live. Roaring, he performed an incantation gesture, summoning a long spear, a huge axe, and two flying swords.Using the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art, he sent the weapons slashing viciously toward his enemies.The faces of the two Luochen Clan cultivators fell. They quickly unleashed magical techniques, causing a boundless black fog to spring up. Booms rang out, and the magical devices Bai Xiaochun had just launched clattered to the ground. At the same time, Bai Xiaochun himself staggered backward, blood spilling out of his mouth.\u201cTime to end things!\u201d For the third time, the two cultivators attacked. As the power of their cultivation bases erupted out, it seemed like they would strike Bai Xiaochun down at any moment.\u201cStay alive!\u201d he said in a hoarse voice, a gleam of madness in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve got to stay alive!\u201dHis internal spiritual energy was flickering on the verge of sputtering out completely, but he let out a roar, and all of the power he had built up in his years of cultivation, power which had seeped into his qi passageways and bones, exploded out like hundreds of flowing streams.RUUUUUUUUMBLE!Up to this point in the fighting, Bai Xiaochun had not called upon these scraps of spiritual energy, but now, in this moment of critical danger, he did. They poured into the main qi passageways, and in the blink of an eye, had transformed into a huge river. As it flowed through his body, a sound like pounding drums burst out within him.At the same time, the cultivation base fluctuations of the seventh level of Qi Condensation suddenly erupted out.When his two opponents, who were in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, suddenly sensed those cultivation base fluctuations coming off of him, their faces flickered with shock and disbelief.\u201cMaking a breakthrough in the middle of fighting!?!?\u201d\u201cHow\u2026 how is that even possible?!?!\u201d As they reeled in shock, Bai Xiaochun looked up, and his eyes were glowing brightly. The surge of spiritual power couldn\u2019t heal his wounds, but it could revive him from his state of listlessness, and give him one more chance to make it out of the situation alive.He sprang forward toward the two Luochen Clan cultivators, who cried out in alarm as black light covered his right hand, and the Throat Crushing Grasp was unleashed.A cracking sound was heard as one of his opponents, unable to dodge, was pulled toward Bai Xiaochun\u2019s right hand. It was almost as if some invisible force were dragging him to Bai Xiaochun, who summarily crushed his neck.His companion looked on, scalp tingling in shock. When Bai Xiaochun turned to look at him, the man screamed, eyes shining with terror as he fell into retreat.\u201cCrown Prince, save me!!\u201d This was the sole surviving clan member in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, screaming for help.At the moment, Chen Heng was still ninety meters away. Seeing what was happening, he let out an enraged roar.\u201cAre you looking to die!?!?\u201dBai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even look at him; he instantly flashed an incantation gesture with his right hand and pointed out. Immediately, the fallen magical devices in the area began to tremble, and then emitted droning sounds as they apparently sensed Bai Xiaochun calling to them.Then they suddenly flew up into the air, moving far faster than they had before, speeding toward the approaching Chen Heng to block his path.Banging sounds rang out as Chen Heng was forced to deal with the weapons. He was in the ninth level of Qi Condensation, but even he couldn\u2019t instantly bypass them.As Chen Heng was being delayed, Bai Xiaochun closed in on the remaining cultivator. Eyes flickering with killing intent, he unleashed a fist strike.A boom echoed out, and blood sprayed from the man\u2019s mouth. He was just about to continue to fall back, but didn\u2019t notice that Bai Xiaochun had just performed an incantation gesture with his left hand. A wooden sword appeared behind the man, closing in noiselessly and then stabbing through his head in a shower of blood.The man\u2019s eyes went wide as he toppled down to the ground, where he twitched a few times, blood flowing out of his mouth. This his eyes faded, and he was dead.Having accomplished these things, Bai Xiaochun staggered to the side. Although he had just experienced a cultivation base breakthrough, the series of deadly moves he had just unleashed had almost completely drained him. Blood oozed constantly out of his mouth as he once again lurched off into the jungle.He knew that his final opponent was the strongest of them all, and was already able to sense that he was in the ninth level of Qi Condensation.\u201cNinth level of Qi Condensation\u2026.\u201d he thought bitterly. His burning desire to live caused his blood to surge through his heart. He knew that this time, either he would die, or his opponent would.There was no third option.As he made his retreat, Chen Heng let out an enraged howl. He was surrounded by a blood mist, which caused the magical devices to tremble, and then begin to crack. Moments later, they exploded, and Chen Heng shot out from within the blood mist. When he looked around at his three dead compatriots, he roared in fury, then shot after Bai Xiaochun.The two of them sped through the jungle of the nameless mountain range, heading deeper and deeper in. Thunder boomed, even though it was daytime. No lightning was visible, but the rain poured down harder and harder.\u201cAre you Shangguan Tianyou, or Lu Tianlei!?\u201d Chen Heng yelled. He quickly performed an incantation gesture, causing nine streams of blood mist to shoot toward Bai Xiaochun, like nine blood-colored anacondas.\u201cI\u2019m your grandpa!\u201d Bai Xiaochun retorted, despite how ashen his face was. After evading the attacks, he glanced back at the Crown Prince, who was getting closer by the moment. Trembling, he crouched down, then shot forward with even greater speed. Even as Chen Heng prepared to do the same, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s foot slammed into a tree, stopping him mid-flight.Then, he twisted, borrowing the momentum of the tree as it snapped back to shoot toward Chen Heng.\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are,\u201d Chen Heng said, \u201ctoday, you\u2019re gonna die!\u201d Killing intent flickered in his eyes, and his right hand flashed with an incantation gesture. Nine blood anacondas once again shot toward Bai Xiaochun with gaping maws.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were bright red as he let out a howl. His hands flashed in a double-handed incantation gesture as he drew upon what remained of his spiritual energy to form a violet cauldron. The cauldron instantly spread out to surround him, completely blocking the path of the nine blood anacondas as he smashed toward Chen Heng.\u201cChild\u2019s play!\u201d Chen Heng said with a cold laugh. Another incantation gesture transformed the nine blood anacondas into a fog, which then re-formed around him in the shape of a blood-colored skull. Then the skull shot toward the violet cauldron.Massive booms rang out as the violet cauldron cracked and then exploded. The blood fog skull was significantly damaged, but remained intact.After the collision, the collapsed cauldron revealed Bai Xiaochun, who shot out of the fragmented remains toward the fog beneath him.At the same time, Chen Heng\u2019s eyes flickered. Then he leaped upward out of the fog, right hand flashing an incantation gesture to produce a vicious ghost face.At the same time, he threw his head back and glared at Bai Xiaochun.Their eyes met, and then they slammed into each other, one using a fist, the other a palm. Black light flashed as the Undying Iron Skin went into action to meet the bizarre magical technique that was the ghost face.A deafening boom rang out. Blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth, and cracking sounds rang out from within him as he was sent tumbling backward like a kite with its string cut, to slam into a nearby tree.Chen Heng was shaken, and his face was ashen. His qi and blood were churning, and shock filled him regarding how powerful Bai Xiaochun was. However, he instantly shot back toward his opponent, raising his right hand, which caused all of the fog in the area to form together into a huge, blood-colored face which crushed down toward Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered with the ferocity that comes from being pushed into a corner. He twisted in mid air, pointing toward Chen Heng to unleash the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art.He wasn\u2019t using it to control random objects, but instead, Chen Heng\u2019s body! It was a technique Chen Heng had never even heard of before. Suddenly, a powerful force wrapped around him, as though a gigantic hand had grabbed him.He laughed coldly as his cultivation base erupted out, and the blood-colored face howled, causing Bai Xiaochun\u2019s spiritual energy to shatter. At the same time, Chen Heng quivered.It was in that moment that a wooden sword shot toward him, and Bai Xiaochun also charged forth, holding nothing back as called upon the full power of his Undying Iron Skin.\u201cWhat a joke!\u201d Chen Heng said, flicking his sleeve. The blood-colored face passed through him, crushing toward the wooden sword. When the two met, the wooden sword trembled, but didn\u2019t break. Instead, it stabbed through the face, opening up a gap.Bai Xiaochun dove in through that very gap, relying on his Undying Iron Skin to deal with the injuries. As he shot out, Chen Heng\u2019s eyes flickered, and he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand.The wave of a finger caused an arc of blood-colored light to appear, a curving blade that sliced toward Bai Xiaochun.In the blink of an eye, the curving blood-colored light hit Bai Xiaochun, who coughed up a mouthful of blood. And yet, his fist, backed by the full power of his cultivation base, rocketed out.A boom rang out as Chen Heng was shoved backward by several paces, his face draining of blood. However, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t done yet. As of this moment, it seemed he was completely overdrawing on his strength and even his life force\u2026 to unleash an explosive attack.RUUUUUUUUMBLE!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 61: Fatal Attack!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 61: Fatal Attack!Bai Xiaochun moved so incredibly fast that Chen Heng didn\u2019t have time to react. Punches and kicks instantly turned into a maddening storm of attacks.Chen Heng\u2019s expression was extremely unsightly as he performed incantation gestures to summon protective shields. Rain pelted down in the jungle, and booms echoed out as he fought with Bai Xiaochun.The battle so far left Chen Heng dumbfounded. Earlier, he had already acknowledged that this particular Outer Sect disciple of the Spirit Stream Sect was formidable, but it wasn\u2019t until actually fighting that it became clear how much he had underestimated him.To be able to slaughter over ten of his fellow clan members, including cultivators in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, with seeming ease, indicated he had a high level of skill. That was not something that an ordinary qi Condensation disciple could do. The Spirit Stream Sect was one of the great sects, so it was expected that their disciples would surpass the local cultivator clans in terms of latent talent, but he had never imagined that the disparity would be like this.\u201cHis fleshly body is too resilient. What body refinement technique does he use? Don\u2019t tell me that his power and speed are both a result of body refinement?!\u201d Chen Heng flicked his sleeve, sending a fog rolling out to defend against Bai Xiaochun. Bai Xiaochun ignored any potential injuries as he attacked again. At the same time, Chen Heng\u2019s face grew more and more pale.\u201cMost terrifying are his powers of recovery! If his cultivation base were at the eighth level of Qi Condensation\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be a match for him at all!\u201d Chen Heng couldn\u2019t imagine how someone could receive so many injuries, and yet still be able to unleash such explosive power. Virtually anyone else who was on the receiving end of such punishment would have long since passed out.Unfortunately, Bai Xiaochun was like an oil lamp running out of oil, just barely holding on.\u201cI need to get this battle done with and kill him,\u201d Chen Heng thought, eyes glittering coldly. \u201cThat way no other complications will arise!\u201d However, it was at this point that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes also glittered, and he suddenly fell back, performing a double-handed incantation gesture; Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning sent a huge cauldron rumbling toward Chen Heng.Chen Heng\u2019s eyes narrowed as the fog which surrounded him transformed into a huge hand that shot toward the cauldron. The two collided, and the cauldron instantly collapsed, as if it hadn\u2019t been backed by even the smallest bit of power.Chen Heng instantly realized that he had been fooled, but he didn\u2019t seem fazed at all, and in fact his eyes glinted sharply.\u201cRed Devil Grand Magic!\u201d he said coolly. Immediately, massive amounts of red light shone out, and his skin turned crimson.Even as that happened, Bai Xiaochun leaped into the air and swung his left leg toward Chen Heng in a powerful arcing kick which kicked up a huge wind.Chen Heng chuckled coldly, thrusting his right forearm out to block the kick.BOOM!A sound like thunder rang out, accompanied by cracking sounds. Tears streamed down Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face as he staggered back, heart thumping.\u201cHow did this guy get so strong so fast?\u201d he thought. \u201cRed Devil Grand Magic? His skin is red, and now he\u2019s way more powerful!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was in so much pain that his heart was shaking. His left leg was twisted at an odd angle, and although his skin remained intact, the flesh underneath was mangled, and bones were broken. His breathing was ragged, and he was exhausted. Each time his injuries worsened. Bai Xiaochun felt as if he couldn\u2019t go on any further. By this point he had come to the realization that his body was constantly fixing itself. The strange regenerative power ensured that even the most serious of injuries were slowly healed. He wasn\u2019t sure, but guessed that it might be an outworking of the Undying Live Forever Technique.Chen Heng\u2019s right arm seemed to be fine, but closer examination would reveal that it was shaking. His skin was even redder than before, and the bones inside were broken.\u201cYou have your body refinement technique, and so does my Luochen Clan!\u201d Chen Heng began to advance with speed that seemed even greater than Bai Xiaochun\u2019s; it was almost like he was a different person, a person with boundless power at his disposal.In the blink of an eye, fierce fighting was once again underway within the jungle.Booms rang out constantly. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s right leg was seriously hurt, and the bones of his left leg were broken. He could barely stand straight, and was suffering setback after setback. The sensation of imminent death grew stronger. This Chen Heng was by far the most powerful opponent Bai Xiaochun had ever fought.Bai Xiaochun eyes were bloodshot as his right hand shot out. Black light shone as the Throat Crushing Grasp was unleashed, like a bolt of black lightning that shot toward Chen Heng\u2019s throat.Chen Heng\u2019s eyes shone with an intense light when he realized that this was a move he had seen before, and was prepared to face. Red light flashed around him as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s right hand closed in. Chen Heng reached out casually, grabbed Bai Xiaochun\u2019s right hand, then crushed it hard. Cracking sounds rang out as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand was completely shattered.Chen Heng frowned; he hadn\u2019t expected things to be this simple. But then his heart seized as he thought about the vicious tactics Bai Xiaochun had already used in the fighting, and how he would even allow himself to be injured in order to unleash a devastating attack. Chen Heng instantly pushed back, and especially tried to move his neck out of the way.At the same time, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s left hand shone with black light, shooting past Chen Heng\u2019s neck and latching onto his shoulder.The power of the Throat Crushing Grasp erupted, and a cracking sound rang out!Chen Heng\u2019s face was ashen, and sweat was pouring down his face. The bones of his left shoulder instantly shattered, and the intense pain caused him to let out a bellow of rage.Red light shimmered around him as he unleashed massive power, grabbing Bai Xiaochun\u2019s left hand. Although Bai Xiaochun was inclined to pull his hand back, Chen Heng was too fast, and in an instant, his hand locked onto Bai Xiaochun\u2019s.\u201cDie!\u201d he howled, eyes bloodshot as he performed an incantation gesture with his left hand and then reached out to tap Bai Xiaochun\u2019s forehead.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered with a vicious gleam as he suddenly leaned to the side, allowing the bones in his left hand to snap as his right leg shot through the air and slammed into Chen Heng\u2019s body.Blood sprayed out of Chen Heng\u2019s mouth, and he was sent tumbling backward, with no choice other than to release his grip on Bai Xiaochun. That in turn allowed Bai Xiaochun to fall back at high speed.Within an instant, roughly thirty meters of space opened up between the two of them. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hands were both crippled. His right arm was mangled, and although the left one was intact, his twisted fingers were incapable of unleashing the Throat Crushing Grasp.Both of his legs were shaking. The left one was distorted into an odd shape, and blood soaked his right leg. The kick he had just unleashed had come with a terrible price.He could barely stand up, and was in fact forced to lean back against one of the towering trees. He bit down on his tongue to force himself from lapsing into unconsciousness. He was now at his very limit. The only limb he could actually move was his left arm. Everything was numb. And yet, he still looked like he wanted to fight.As for Chen Heng, his eyes were bright red. His left shoulder felt like it was on fire, and he couldn\u2019t even lift his right hand. Several of his ribs were broken, and blood oozed constantly out of his mouth.\u201cI underestimated you!\u201d he said hoarsely, glaring at Bai Xiaochun. He could never have imagined that with a cultivation base like his own, it would be so difficult to kill the injured Bai Xiaochun. From the look of it, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s body refinement practices had led to some sort of undying secret magic that kept him alive despite such serious injuries.In fact, to deal with him, Chen Heng had used almost every magical technique at his disposal, even the Red Devil Grand Magic.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s time to end this fight!\u201d Chen Heng took a deep breath. Suddenly, all of the redness in his skin seemed to evaporate, transforming into a mist that rose up into the air. Normal color rapidly returned to Chen Heng\u2019s skin, and he seemed to weaken dramatically. The fight had been a difficult one even for Chen Heng; his opponent\u2019s tenacious desire to stay alive, his shocking restorative powers, and his willingness to sustain damage to inflict fatalities was completely shocking.\u201cRed Devil Secret Magic, Blood Saber\u2026 Attack!\u201d Chen Heng bit down on his tongue and spit out a mouthful of blood. The blood merged into the blood mist from moments ago, which then roiled and, in the blink of an eye, transformed into a long, blood-colored saber!The illusory saber was over three meters long and, shockingly, was covered with innumerable faces, all of which were emitting torturous screams. Chen Heng waved his finger, and the blood-colored saber began to move toward Bai Xiaochun!Utilizing this secret magic caused Chen Heng to sag again in weakness, and he was forced to reach out and support himself on a nearby tree. His face was ashen, and some of his hair had even turned white.\u201cDie!\u201d he growled, giving Bai Xiaochun an enraged stare.An unprecedented sensation of crisis exploded up within Bai Xiaochun as he realized that no matter what he tried to do, he would not be able to dodge or evade this blow. He was stuck.A crevice snaked toward him on the ground, and the tree behind him withered as the long, blood-colored saber rose up high\u2026 and then slashed down toward him!Bai Xiaochun trembled, and his pupils constricted. He didn\u2019t want to die, and in fact was terrified of it. Unfortunately, the regenerative properties of his Undying Live Forever Technique weren\u2019t so Heaven-defying that they could keep up with his current injuries. However, even as the blade descended, a sudden bit of inspiration flashed in his mind. Without the slightest hesitation, he waved his left hand, and a black beam of light shot out. In the blink of an eye, it grew larger, right there in front of him, forming into the shape of\u2026 a wok!It was none other than the turtle-wok!As soon as the wok appeared, the blood-colored blade slashed down onto it, and a deafening boom rang out. The blood-colored blade began to vibrate violently\u2026 and then shattered into countless pieces!As for the turtle-wok, not even the slightest crack appeared on its surface, although the force of the attack transformed it into a black beam of light that shot back inside of Bai Xiaochun.\u201cImpossible!!\u201d A tremor ran through Chen Heng, and he coughed up a mouthful of blood, an incredulous look on his face. He had already been in a weakened state when unleashing the magic, and now that it was broken, the backlash power slammed into him, instantly evaporating his spiritual power and turning his vision dim. \u201cWhat\u2026 what is that thing!?!?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s Lord Turtle!\u201d Bai Xiaochun growled as he stood there, clinging onto life. Blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth, and he rocked back and forth as he stood there. He stepped back, sliding down the trunk of the tree into a sitting position, and began to laugh bitterly.\u201cToo bad I don\u2019t have any weapons\u2026.\u201d He could sense his life force fading away, and his vision was swimming. He thought of summoning his wooden sword, but simply didn\u2019t have the energy. Calling forth the turtle-wok had taken the last scrap of spiritual power he had. He couldn\u2019t even open his bag of holding.\u201cI don\u2019t care what secrets you hold, once you\u2019re dead, everything you have will belong to me.\u201d Chen Heng said, breathing raggedly. He was also like an oil lamp on the verge of sputtering out, although he was in a slightly better position that Bai Xiaochun. After a few breaths of time passed, he struggled to his feet and produced a long sword from his bag of holding, hefted it, and began to walk toward Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun looked at him silently, eyes somewhat blank. He thought back to life in his village, and then he thought about Big Fatty Zhang. He recalled Li Qinghou, the Spirit Stream Sect, and the other amazing people he knew. Du Lingfei. Hou Yunfei. Hou Xiaomei\u2026.Chen Heng slowly approached, then looked down at Bai Xiaochun, who was already emanating a powerful aura of death. He could see that Bai Xiaochun was riddled with wounds, and that he didn\u2019t even have enough spiritual energy to open his bag of holding.\u201cRemember my name. I\u2019m the person who killed you\u2026 Chen Heng of the Luochen Clan.\u201d He raised the sword, which he normally could send flying out with the flick of a sleeve, but now seemed extraordinarily heavy. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful feeling being able to kill a Chosen.\u201dChen Heng was so tired that he was on the verge of passing out, but his eyes glinted with cruelty as he stabbed the sword down toward Bai Xiaochun\u2019s chest.However, even as he did that, Bai Xiaochun suddenly swung his left arm, slamming it into the ground. The bones snapped, and one of them even pierced out through his skin by about three inches.Then he lurched to his feet, propelling his left arm with the last bit of energy he had. Even as the sword stabbed into his chest, his arm slammed into Chen Heng\u2019s neck, and the bone\u2026 pierced directly into his throat.Then Bai Xiaochun fell to the ground and, energy completely spent, lapsed into total unconsciousness.A tremor ran through Chen Heng. Everything had happened too quickly, giving him no time to prepare or react, and he had been too exhausted to dodge. Once the bone stabbed into his neck, blood began to pour out onto the ground. He tried to cover the wound, but it did no good. He stared down at his own blood on the jagged bones which protruded from Bai Xiaochun\u2019s arm, and couldn\u2019t help but marvel at how ridiculous the situation was. It didn\u2019t even seem possible. Eyes flickering with an unyielding gleam, he thought about all of his goals and pursuits in life, and then laughed a bitter laugh.\u201cThat was your dying blow, huh\u2026.\u201d He staggered back and toppled to the ground, dead, his eyes staring up into the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Around evening, it stopped, and the setting sun just managed to create a little bit of a rainbow.However, as the sun set, the rainbow gradually faded away.The jungle was quiet. Even the stench of blood had vanished. However, the corpse-lined path stretching backward bore testament to the deadly fighting which had played out.As Chen Heng slipped away into death, his eyes continued to shine with an unyielding, incredulous expression.Next to his corpse, Bai Xiaochun lay still and unmoving. The flame of his life force was roughly ninety percent extinguished, with only a little spark left behind, struggling to stay alive.Eventually, footsteps could be heard from off in the distance. Someone was walking through the muddy rainwater and fallen leaves, to eventually come to a stop next to Chen Heng.It was an old man wearing a long black robe. He had flowing white hair, and his face was covered with wrinkles, making him seem profoundly ancient. Apparently, he had lived for so long than an aura of death was already seeping out from him.\u201cIntense focus has bolstered his soul\u2026 he\u2019s dead, and yet his soul hasn\u2019t dispersed. But that won\u2019t last for long.\u201d The man\u2019s voice was raspy, but also vague and bizarre as it echoed out into the jungle. Suddenly, the forehead of Chen Heng\u2019s corpse split open, and a green wisp of qi floated out. It swirled together in midair, forming into the blurry image of a soul, about the size of the palm of a hand.This was Chen Heng, although his eyes were blank and he was trembling, as if his mind and consciousness were gone.The old man extended a finger, and Chen Heng\u2019s soul flew toward him and disappeared inside.After taking away Chen Heng\u2019s soul, the mysterious old man looked over at Bai Xiaochun, mixed emotions playing out on his face. He even seemed to be reminiscing about the past.\u201cI never imagined that I would once again lay eyes on\u2026 the Undying Live Forever Technique\u2026.\u201d He closed his eyes for a moment, and then sighed. That sound seemed to transform his surroundings. Time seemed to suddenly flow differently, as if the entire area were being separated from the rest of the world.The innumerable plants in the area suddenly went still, as if in death, and then transformed into ash.Chen Heng\u2019s corpse instantly withered up, and within the space of a few breaths of time, was nothing more than a skeleton. Even that turned into dust, which crumbled down into the muddy ground.Only Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t affected. In fact, vast amounts of life force poured into him, rapidly healing his various injuries.The old man stood there with his eyes closed, as motionless as a statue. It almost looked\u2026 as if he possessed no aura whatsoever, nor any life force. It was like he didn\u2019t exist at all within the world, a discarnate soul who refused to be reborn.Meanwhile, in the same moment that Chen Heng died, Patriarch Luochen was back in the Luochen Clan in the Fallenstar Mountains. Suddenly, his eyes snapped open, and an uneasy feeling filled his heart. He looked around at the clan members around him, and could see that quite a few of the eleven cultivators sent out of the clan had been killed. However, when he saw that Chen Heng\u2019s soul still existed, he felt slightly better.\u201cThey\u2019re only three Outer Sect disciples, how could they have lasted so long\u2026?\u201d he muttered. \u201cSo many clan members have been killed. Well, considering the level of Heng\u2019er\u2019s cultivation base, there\u2019s no way they could kill him. Most likely, he\u2019s already wiped them out and is on his way back.\u201d The uneasy feeling still lurked there inside of him, though. Eyes flickering, he sent a few more clan members out to investigate, all of whom were in the seventh level of Qi Condensation.Having done that, he took a deep breath.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now. The Inverse Blood Grand Magic only needs one more day of work!\u201d Gritting his teeth, he suppressed the uneasiness he felt. He knew that there was no backing out of the plan now, and really no other option than to hold on for another day\u2026 then everything would be worth it!In that same moment, Hou Yunfei was in a valley a bit more than five kilometers away from the border of Patriarch Luochen\u2019s security spell formation. His face was ashen, and he had reached the point where he couldn\u2019t take another step further. Coughing up a mouthful of blood, he collapsed to the ground, chuckling bitterly.\u201cJunior Brother Bai\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t save you\u2026.\u201d He clenched his hands in anguish and helplessness before passing into unconsciousness.In another direction was Du Lingfei, her hair disheveled, her skin sallow. Her qi passageways were almost completely destroyed, and she cut a completely different picture than she had in the past, in her peak of beauty.Her eyes were lustreless, and she looked almost like the walking dead. However, a shocking level of willpower kept her staggering forward, clutching a jade slip in her hand. There was only one thought in her head, a thought that wouldn\u2019t leave.She had to break free and send word to the sect. She had to\u2026 save Bai Xiaochun.She proceeded along, one step after another. When she fell to the ground, she would crawl back to her feet. Her clothing was torn, her veins were bleeding dry, and she could barely see clearly. And yet\u2026 she kept moving forward.Time passed. Du Lingfei had long since forgotten about the injured state of her body. She wasn\u2019t thinking about her own life, nor could she even remember how long she had been walking. She proceeded along until suddenly she experienced a sensation like passing through a sheet of water. In that moment, her eyes began to shine brightly.\u201cAm I out\u2026?\u201d she murmured through parched, cracked lips. Trembling, she looked at the jade slip clutched in her hands, the jade slip which hadn\u2019t so much as vibrated once during the past half month. But now, it vibrated, as though an invisible connection had suddenly been established\u2026 linking her to the sect.\u201cThe Luochen Clan has turned traitor. Elder Brother Feng died in battle. I\u2019m not sure if Elder Brother Hou is still alive, and Junior Brother Bai\u2026 drew the enemy away so that we could escape. I am disciple Du Lingfei, and I beg of the sect\u2026 to send backup immediately.\u201d As soon as she finished sending the message, Du Lingfei sagged down into a sitting position. Then she turned to look behind her, tears streaming down her face.She would never forget how Bai Xiaochun had returned to fight, as if he had veins of steel. She would never forget the tragic and moving image of him running out to draw the attention of the Luochen Clan. She would never forget everything that had happened on their journey together.\u201cJunior Brother Bai, Elder Brother Hou\u2026 you have to stay alive\u2026.\u201d Du Lingfei wept, her tears falling to the ground in front of her. Eventually, she couldn\u2019t hold on any longer, and collapsed into unconsciousness.As Du Lingfei was transmitting her message, the Missions Office back on the Fragrant Cloud Peak in the Spirit Stream Sect was as busy as ever. Outer Sect disciples were running back and forth handling various tasks, and deep within the Missions Office itself, there was a middle-aged man in a Daoist robe who was in the middle of maintaining the records about various missions. Arrayed in front of him was a collection of thousands of jade slips, which contained the information of all sect disciples with open missions.Suddenly, one of the jade slips flickered with light. Expression the same as ever, the middle-aged man waved his hand, causing the jade slip to fly over into his hand. After scanning it with divine sense, his eyes went wide, and he shot to his feet.\u201cThe Luochen Clan has turned traitor!!\u201d he cried, panting. The enormity of such a matter could not be understated. Whether or not it was true or false, he absolutely had to report the matter to his superiors. Holding back such information was a crime punishable by execution, so he didn\u2019t dare to dally. He immediately produced a violet jade slip from his robe and transmitted the new intelligence.The report was instantly sent to the Hall of Justice. Of course, Qian Dajin worked in the Hall of Justice, but he had a very lowly position, and an intelligence report like this was something he didn\u2019t even qualify to look at. Almost as soon as the report arrived at the Hall of Justice, the entire organization sprang into immediate action. After all, the Hall of Justice was tasked with defending the entire Spirit Stream Sect, and the efficiency with which they went about it was shocking.It only took the time it takes an incense stick to burn to verify the authenticity of the report.Then, war drums began to sound through the entire south bank. All of the disciples looked around in shock. The Outer Sect disciples didn\u2019t know the significance of the war drums, but the Inner Sect disciples on the three mountain peaks all knew, and it caused their expressions to flicker as they looked up from whatever they were doing.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cWhen the war drums beat, we can\u2019t return to the Spirit Stream Sect until blood is shed and the enemy clan is exterminated!! Heavens\u2026.\u201dEven as everyone was reeling in shock, the voice of an old man suddenly filled the entire south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect.\u201cI am Ouyang Jie of the Hall of Justice. All Inner Sect disciples of the south bank\u2019s three mountain peaks are to immediately cancel all previous missions, activities, and secluded meditation sessions. You have twenty breaths of time to gather at the main gate! Lateness will not be tolerated!\u201dEven as the words left his mouth, the Inner Sect disciples on Green Crest Peak, Fragrant Cloud Peak, and Violet Cauldron Peak immediately dropped whatever tasks they had at hand. Trembling, but without the slightest hesitation, they sprang into motion.Even people involved in important tasks didn\u2019t dare to tarry for even a moment. Everyone knew that Ouyang Jie was an Elder of the Hall of Justice, and that he was\u2026 cold-hearted and merciless!He had a Daoist name in addition to his given name; he was known as Daoist Jackal. For him to take the lead in a sect affair meant that something completely infuriating had occurred. It meant\u2026 that people needed to die. It meant\u2026 that a clan needed to be exterminated!Rumbling sounds filled the air as countless figures appeared, speeding toward the main gate. Soon it became clear that among the three mountains of the south bank, there were at least two thousand Inner Sect disciples. Normally, it was a difficult thing to catch sight of one or two, so the sight of so many left the Outer Sect disciples completely shaken.There were also several hundred disciples from the Hall of Justice, clad in black robes and led by an old man with bright red hair. That old man radiated intense killing intent, and he was none other than Ouyang Jie.Soon, over two thousand people were gathered around the main gate, all of whom wore grim and somber expressions.\u201cThe Luochen Clan has turned traitor. The Sect Leader has ordered that their clan\u2026 be exterminated all the way down to the chickens and dogs. Activate the Daoseed Teleportation Portal!\u201d Ouyang Jie waved his sleeve, instantly causing a huge pillar of light to rise up from Mount Daoseed, in the middle of the Spirit Stream Sect.The light climbed up into the air, transforming into a huge teleportation portal, which instantly enveloped the two thousand disciples. Rumbling could be heard as the teleportation process began.The Outer Sect disciples of the south bank gasped, and suddenly, they were filled with sensations of deep pride regarding their sect.Compared to the Spirit Stream Sect, the Luochen Clan was small, with only one Foundation Establishment cultivator. And yet, for the sake of a few Outer Sect disciples, the Spirit Stream Sect had mobilized two thousand individuals. Then there was the violent and powerful Ouyang Jie. All of that\u2026 was a mighty threat!It was a threat to all of the cultivator clans in the territory controlled by the Spirit Stream Sect. The old saying asks, \u201cWhy use a battle-axe to kill a chicken?\u201d In this situation, the Spirit Stream Sect provided the answer: \u201cHow else do you kill chickens than with battle-axes?!\u201dThis was a sect that wouldn\u2019t hold back any resources, not even when it came to Outer Sect disciples. That in turn caused the Outer Sect disciples\u2019 loyalty toward their sect to reach new heights.The Spirit Stream Sect had stood strong for ten thousand years, growing from a tiny little organization to its current height. Naturally, there were aspects to it that others would find astonishing!It was in this moment that, all of a sudden, there on the temple at the very top of Fragrant Cloud Peak, Li Qinghou flew out, face grim, aura murderous. That aura swept out explosively, creating a wild tempest as he shot toward the teleportation portal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 63: Crushing The Luochen Clan!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63: Crushing the Luochen Clan!It only took Li Qinghou a moment to reach the teleportation portal, where he hovered like an unsheathed blade, radiating an intense murderous aura.Ouyang Jie looked over at him, and his pupils constricted slightly. Among the three Peak Lords on the south bank, Ouyang Jie viewed Li Qinghou as the most important. In fact, he was actually one of the most important people in the entire Spirit Stream Sect.Not only was he a master apothecary, his profound natural talents were extremely rare. For example, he had only practiced cultivation for about a hundred years, but had already reached late Foundation Establishment. In fact, it was even said that, within the entire sect, he was the most likely candidate to break through from Foundation Establishment and acquire a Gold Core.\u201cI heard that one of those four Outer Sect disciples is connected to Li Qinghou somehow\u2026.\u201d Ouyang Jie thought. At the same time, rumbling could be heard from the spell formation, and countless dazzling beams of light rose up. Instantly, the group of two thousand cultivators, including Li Qinghou, became blurry, and then disappeared altogether.The journey which had taken Bai Xiaochun and the others several months to complete, occurred in only a few seconds, thanks to the activation of the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s teleportation portal.Rumbling like thunder filled the air over Du Lingfei\u2019s unconscious form. The sky dimmed as something like an invisible hand ripped open a huge rift, revealing the image of an enormous spell formation.It descended rapidly to the ground, causing everything to quake in a fifty kilometer area. Blazing, fiery lines appeared in the ground as the shape and design of the spell formation appeared on the surface of the land.Within that 50 kilometer area, all grass, rocks, mountains, everything turned into ash, vanishing in an instant. This spell formation was incredibly domineering, and destroyed everything that got in its way.Du Lingfei was in that area, and immediately fell under the protection of the spell formation, ensuring she wasn\u2019t harmed at all. Even as the land shook, numerous figures came into view.It took only a moment for the more than two thousand Inner Sect disciples from the south bank to appear. There was still enough teleportation power swirling around them for another teleportation to be carried out, but first, Ouyang Jie and Li Qinghou strode forward to the unconscious Du Lingfei. Several female disciples reached her ahead of them, covering her with a set of spare garments and also administering some medicinal pills. With the influx of spiritual energy, Du Lingfei gradually opened her eyes. Her expression was blank, but when she saw all of the forces from the sect surrounding her, she began to weep, and a feeling of excitement flooded through her.Furthermore, considering she was an Outer Sect disciple of Fragrant Cloud Peak, when she noticed Peak Lord Li Qinghou standing there, even more tears welled up in her eyes. At the same time, disciples on either side of her helped her to rise to a sitting position.\u201cPeak Lord, please rescue Junior Brother Bai\u2026.\u201d she implored, face ashen.\u201cWhat happened to him?!\u201d Li Qinghou said, stepping forward to stand directly in front of Du Lingfei. His eyes burned with fury and deep anxiety.\u201cJunior Brother Bai\u2026 went out on his own to distract the Luochen Clan cultivators so that Elder Brother Hou and I could escape. They started chasing after him\u2026.\u201d Weeping, she went on to explain the entire situation.Virtually none of the surrounding two thousand disciples knew Bai Xiaochun, but as they listened to Du Lingfei\u2019s tale, they were visibly moved. The intense and tragic events even caused them to gasp.They learned about how Feng Yan fell in battle to protect his fellow disciples, and how Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei risked almost certain death to try to escape. They heard about how the Luochen Clan sent out two waves of cultivators in pursuit, including several in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and one in the ninth\u2026.Even these members of the Inner Sect would be hard pressed to make it out alive under such circumstances.When Du Lingfei talked about Bai Xiaochun, they could sense how devoted and loyal he was. In fact, he was already the type of person who could be considered Chosen.He had the option of fleeing on his own, but instead returned to save his fellow disciples. He fought enemies far more powerful than himself, then helped carry his two wounded companions for more than half a month, on a journey of nearly 5,000 kilometers.In the end, he chose to sacrifice himself rather than his principles, all to give his fellow disciples a chance to make it out alive. The result was that Du Lingfei was able to send her message. Were it not for that, the sect might not have learned about the traitorous actions of the Luochen Clan until it was too late.It didn\u2019t take long before Bai Xiaochun had taken root deep within the hearts of the Inner Sect disciples. To them, he was profoundly devoted and loyal, an elegant and even heroic man, someone with veins of steel.The people from the Hall of Justice were completely shaken. Among their number was Qian Dajin, whose jaw dropped as he heard Du Lingfei\u2019s story. He almost couldn\u2019t believe that the Bai Xiaochun she was talking about was the same person in his mind. His impulsive plotting earlier had left him nervous about possible investigations on the part of the sect. Although he hadn\u2019t been absolutely sure that Bai Xiaochun was the little turtle, in his pettiness, he would rather kill the wrong person accidentally than risk the right person getting away. As of this moment, he breathed a sigh of relief. With Feng Yan being dead, there was no way word would get out.Even the iron-hearted Ouyang Jie, Daoist Jackal, couldn\u2019t help but sigh in response to the tale, and a gleam of admiration appeared in his eyes. Considering the level of his cultivation base, he could tell at a glance that Du Lingfei wasn\u2019t making the story up; everything she had said, although perhaps not completely accurate, was the truth.\u201cThe Spirit Stream Sect cannot permit a disciple such as that to perish in this place!\u201d Ouyang Jie flicked his sleeve and immediately sent several hundred disciples out to search for Hou Yunfei and Bai Xiaochun.Li Qinghou slowly looked off into the distance, eyes completely bloodshot, heart aching bitterly. Considering what Bai Xiaochun had done here, Li Qinghou suddenly felt as if he had judged him incorrectly. At the same time, he knew that, considering the circumstances, Bai Xiaochun chances of getting out alive\u2026 were small, to say the least.\u201cAnd I was the one who brought you to this sect\u2026.\u201d he thought. His murderous aura exploded out with even more intensity. Taking a step forward, he drew upon some of the remaining teleportation power to suddenly vanish in the direction of the Luochen Clan.Ouyang Jie sighed. After hearing Du Lingfei\u2019s tale, he knew that the situation did not bode well for Bai Xiaochun. Flickering into motion, he gathered the remaining forces and began another teleportation.Rumbling echoed out in all directions as Li Qinghou and Ouyang Jie led nearly two thousand disciples to appear in midair above the Luochen Clan mansion in the Fallenstar Mountains.The cloud layers were ripped apart as the teleportation portal became a powerful attack bearing down with intense energy of Heaven and Earth. Cries of alarm rang out within the mansion as the spell formation descended upon it.RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!The spell formation landed, instantly shattering the limestone flooring, transforming it into ash. The mansion itself collapsed into rubble.Roars of rage echoed out as numerous figures flew out, expressions of fury and hopelessness on their faces.The guardian stone lions and the fruit trees from the courtyard transformed into puppets that instantly went on the offensive. Li Qinghou was the first person to make a move. He waved his sleeve, causing the lions to explode loudly. As for the fruit trees, they trembled, and the fruit began to fall off their branches. However, even as the fruits fled, they were destroyed.Rumbling echoed out as the Spirit Stream Sect disciples unleashed mass destruction.Li Qinghou shot toward the center of the destroyed Luochen Clan mansion. His right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and he waved his finger, summoning a green fireball. His hair flew wildly about him as he then sent the fireball blasting down into the ground.Flames erupted, smashing into the rubble of the mansion and sweeping it away. The handful of enemy cultivators who had been attacking let out miserable shrieks as they were instantly incinerated.Next, Li Qinghou lifted his right foot into the air and stamped it down hard. The land shattered, and a huge crevice was ripped open, revealing the necropolis down below.At almost exactly the same time, the lake of blood spiraled out, followed by the Luochen Clan\u2019s Patriarch.When the man saw Li Qinghou, his face filled with an expression of despair. The Spirit Stream Sect had arrived too suddenly. The spell formation he was working on was on the cusp of being completed, and had anyone else arrived, he might have been able to delay them for long enough. But unexpectedly, the people who came were none other than Li Qinghou and Ouyang Jie!The Patriarch fell back, crying out miserably, \u201cFlee! Anyone who can escape, get out of here!\u201dTrembling, the Luochen Clan cultivators in the necropolis began to flee in all directions. However, Ouyang Jie\u2019s face was expressionless as he waved his hand, sending the Inner Sect disciples after them in pursuit.Li Qinghou\u2019s eyes locked onto Patriarch Luochen, and the lake of blood that surrounded him. Ouyang Jie did the same, and then, flames of rage appeared in both mens\u2019 eyes.\u201cYou slaughtered innocent mortals?\u201d Li Qinghou growled. \u201cThe Heavens cannot tolerate the existence of a clan like yours!\u201d With that, he waved his sleeve, sending a destructive sea of flames out.At the same time, bloodcurdling screams began to rise up as the Spirit Stream Sect disciples began to slaughter and crush the Luochen Clan cultivators.Two thousand people versus a few hundred.Patriarch Luochen could only watch as everyone in his clan was killed, both descendants from his own bloodline, and members of other bloodlines. Screaming miserably, he fled at top speed in an attempt to escape.However, in that instant, he was overwhelmed by Li Qinghou\u2019s sea of flames. Face extremely grim, Li Qinghou clenched his hand into a fist.RUMBLE!Patriarch Luochen\u2019s screams intensified as he erupted into flames. His flesh and blood were incinerated, and in the blink of an eye, he was reduced to nothing more than ash. Li Qinghou\u2026 killed him with one attack!When the surrounding Inner Sect disciples saw that, they gasped in shock. Even Ouyang Jie\u2019s eyes went wide in astonishment.As Li Qinghou hovered there in midair, he waved his hand again, sending the sea of flames exploding out again. The entire Luochen Clan was engulfed, and everything began to burn. Li Qinghou looked off into the distance, his expression somewhat disconsolate.Sighing, he said, \u201cBai Xiaochun, I, Li Qinghou\u2026 have let down your Bai Clan.\u201d In his bitterness, he flew off into the distance. He wasn\u2019t willing to entrust the search for Bai Xiaochun to others. If there was even the slightest hope that he was alive, he himself would search for him.Li Qinghou left, flames rising high into the sky behind him. As for the Inner Sect disciples, expressions of excitement began to appear on their faces. Now more than ever, they realized how powerful and glorious their sect was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 64: Morale And A FuneralPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64: Morale and a FuneralAs Ouyang Jie watched Li Qinghou leaving, his voice rang out to the surrounding disciples. \u201cSplit up and do everything you can to locate Bai Xiaochun. Whoever finds him will receive a reward of merit points from me personally. If you encounter any surviving Luochen Clan cultivators, kill them!\u201dTwo thousand cultivators spent an entire month searching the 5,000 kilometer area.They searched virtually every possible location, but no one ever found Bai Xiaochun. However, they did discover the corpses of the Luochen Clan cultivators he had killed. As corpses turned up one after another, the Inner Sect disciples grew more and more shocked.Virtually all of the Luochen Clan cultivators had been killed with a single blow. The Inner Sect disciples could scarcely imagine how an Outer Sect disciple in the sixth level of Qi Condensation could possibly have done something like that.Qian Dajin gasped over and over again, and suddenly realized it would actually be much better for him if Bai Xiaochun was dead. He himself was probably not a match for someone so violent and powerful. Li Qinghou\u2019s fury caused him to grow more nervous, and he even began to wail inwardly.\u201cDammit! Why didn\u2019t you tell me you had such connections? If you had, I would never have provoked you!\u201dEventually they found the corpses of the three disciples who were in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and they could only imagine what that bitter, intense battle must have been like. It left them reeling.Soon everyone came to the conclusion that Bai Xiaochun\u2026 had most likely been killed in that nameless mountain range. That was a place rife with perilous beasts, and numerous other dangers that could kill a person and leave no corpse behind.Eventually, they captured the two Luochen Clan disciples that Chen Heng had dispatched after Hou Yunfei and Du Lingfei different directions. When they learned that one of the people chasing Bai Xiaochun had been none other than the Luochen Clan\u2019s Crown Prince, who was in the ninth level of Qi Condensation, they all resigned themselves to the fact\u2026 that Bai Xiaochun really must be dead.After the month of searching ended, everyone returned to the sect. Hou Yunfei had been found relatively early on, seriously injured, but alive. With the full power of the sect focused on healing him, he ended up being just fine.Both he and Du Lingfei had performed significant meritorious service for the sect, but that left them with no feeling of excitement. Instead, they felt sadness, and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the events which had occurred.Both of them wanted to go back to join the search efforts when they were underway, but their injuries were too serious. The only person who refused to give up on searching for Bai Xiaochun was Li Qinghou. He journeyed alone into the nameless mountain range, where he searched for two full months. Other than a few places that even he couldn\u2019t enter, he searched the length and breadth of the mountains. Strangely, even though it seemed clear that Bai Xiaochun had to be in these very mountains, he couldn\u2019t find a single trace of him. It was almost as if Bai Xiaochun were currently in some other world.During the process of the search, he ended up fighting quite a few powerful beasts, and was even injured by some of them. Two months later, it was with great bitterness that he stood in front of a certain tree with a blood-stained scrap of cloth stuck to it.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t brought you to the sect\u2026.\u201d Li Qinghou thought. When he closed his eyes, he recalled the image of Bai Xiaochun there on Mount Hood, looking scared to death of the lightning and thunder. He thought about how frightened he had looked at 10,000 Snakes Valley, about what had happened during the sect competition, and about how he had taken first place in all the stone steles.He sighed silently, seemingly growing older as he reached out and picked up the bloodstained cloth. He had already picked up seven or eight similar pieces of cloth just like this during his search.In the end, he left the jungle, transforming into a beam of light that shot off into the distance.Thus ended the rebellion of the Luochen Clan. The Spirit Stream Sect struck like lightning, completely wiping out the traitors. The matter caused quite a stir in the Eastwood Lower Reaches of the Heavenspan River. In the cultivation world of the Eastwood Continent, which was one of the four great continents, countless cultivator clans and sects learned of the matter. As a result, the awe felt toward the Spirit Stream Sect grew, a sect that was one of the Four Great Sects in the Eastwood Lower Reaches.After an investigation by the Spirit Stream Sect, they found some clues as to why the Luochen Clan had turned traitor. The bloodline seal was one reason, but there was an even more profound motivation. After piecing together various clues, the vast ramifications left the Spirit Stream Sect shocked.If they hadn\u2019t stopped the matter when they did, the resulting chain reaction would have led to numerous other cultivator clans hearing about the matter and then following along in the rebellion. It would have been almost the same as a powerful enemy invading Spirit Stream Sect territory, and would have led to grave repercussions, potentially even the destabilization of the sect.The news about the deeds accomplished by Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei quickly spread, as did the stories of Bai Xiaochun nobly sacrificing himself.The fact that he had refused to abandon his fellow disciples, and had even used himself as bait to lead the enemy away, left many people moved. The cultivation world was full of selfish people; individuals like Bai Xiaochun were not common. The loss of such a disciple left many people, even the Sect Leader and Elders, feeling very aggrieved.There were other implications that came along with the whole event. However, as more clues came to light, the Spirit Stream Sect only grew more silent. For some unknown reason, they eventually stopped investigating. However, all of the Foundation Establishment cultivators in the sect increased their level of vigilance to a point far beyond normal.Apparently\u2026 a storm was coming.The south and north banks together had seven Peak Lords. In addition to that were the Sect Leader and other Elders. After much discussion and research, they came to a unanimous decision.Du Lingfei, Hou Yunfei, as well as the perished Feng Yan, had all performed meritorious service. As for Bai Xiaochun\u2026 he had accomplished a tremendous service beyond the ordinary!The final decision was explained by the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong. \u201cA storm is coming. The most important thing\u2026 is to lift everyone\u2019s spirits. For ten thousand years, the morale of our sect has remained high. Considering the tremendous service Bai Xiaochun has performed, at the cost of his very life, we can only repay his kindness by having a grand funeral. Those who contribute to the sect shall never be forgotten.\u201dIn the following days, although the Spirit Stream Sect didn\u2019t investigate any further into the reasons for the betrayal of the Luochen Clan, they took every opportunity to spread the story of how Bai Xiaochun had sacrificed himself for his fellow disciples, and how he had nobly fought for the sect.As the story was propagated, more and more disciples from the various mountain peaks on both the south and north banks learned of the name Bai Xiaochun, and what he had done to save his fellow disciples.Of course, the sect itself wasn\u2019t ambivalent to such a devoted and loyal disciple. Li Qinghou had eradicated an entire clan, and two thousand Inner Sect disciples had been mobilized. Sending such a powerful force to handle the situation was like killing a chicken with a battle-axe.Not only did all the disciples in the sect remember Bai Xiaochun\u2019s name, they were moved by how the sect reacted to the situation. Even though the sect had obviously reacted in such a way intentionally\u2026 that reaction was exactly what the disciples expected.For ten thousand years, that was the unchanging tradition of the Spirit Stream Sect.Touch one of our disciples, and you will die, no matter how far you run!When a Spirit Stream Sect disciple went outside of the sect, they were never alone: they were backed by the entire Spirit Stream Sect. The sect was like a shield, eternally there for their protection.Because of that, the disciples were devoted to their sect, and would expend any and all effort, even give up their lives, to defend it, their home.That was the mighty Spirit Stream Sect, which had started out ten thousand years ago as a tiny sect with only a few dozen people in it.In order to determine whether or not Bai Xiaochun was really dead, the Sect Leader asked for help from one of the sect\u2019s Prime Elders, who was adept at divining information from the Heavens. Unfortunately, his divination magic did not reveal any hint that Bai Xiaochun was still alive in the world. The only thing he discovered was an aura of death, which seemed to prove that Bai Xiaochun\u2026 had died in battle, fighting for the sect.On a rainy morning a few days later, the mournful tolling of bells could be heard throughout the Spirit Stream Sect. Countless disciples wearing black robes emerged silently from their residences, expressions grief on their faces as they gathered midway up Fragrant Cloud Peak.There, a gravestone had been erected, with a portrait of Bai Xiaochun on it, smiling happily.Big Fatty Zhang stood there in the crowd. He glanced at everyone around him, and then looked at the gravestone, and Bai Xiaochun\u2019s name. As the rain fell and soaked his clothing, he wept, recalling all of his memories of the past. He thought about how they had eaten the various pilfered spirit treasures, about how they had laughed and joked together, about how they had sold spots in the Outer Sect, and about stealing chickens\u2026.\u201cNinth Fatty\u2026.\u201d Big Fatty Zhang murmured, looking very sad. His heart felt empty, and the pain made the entire world seem dark.The other fatties from the Ovens, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Elder Brothers, were all filled with grief, and couldn\u2019t stop crying, including Third Fatty Hei.Xu Baocai, Chen Zi\u2019ang, Zhao Yiduo and Elders Xu and Zhou, as well as everyone else Bai Xiaochun had come to know since joining the sect, all stood in the crowd, faces filled with grief.Zhou Xinqi came and stared silently at the gravestone. After hearing the story of what Bai Xiaochun had done, she couldn\u2019t help but think of how zealously he had searched for the chicken thief.Hou Yunfei came, propped up on the shoulder of Hou Xiaomei. He stood there, fists clenched, shaking in grief.\u201cJunior Brother Bai\u2026.\u201d A bitter smile twisted his face. After returning to the sect, he begun spending his days drinking. He just couldn\u2019t forget that moment in which Bai Xiaochun had led all the enemies away, using himself as bait.More and more people showed up, until the middle section of Fragrant Cloud Peak was densely packed with countless disciples, all silently looking at the gravestone.At the front of the crowd was Du Lingfei. Her face was pale, and it was impossible to tell the difference between the tears that streaked down her cheeks, and the rainwater. She seemed to be in a daze, and while her face was as beautiful as it had always been, that beauty was now sad and poignant.\u201cYou could have stayed alive\u2026 but here I am, and you\u2019re gone\u2026.\u201d Du Lingfei\u2019s days had been spent in sorrow and misery recently. She had lost weight, and often dreamed about that moment in which Bai Xiaochun had returned, unshakeable and determined. And then he had left, a scene which left her weeping and wracked with pain.As the mourning bells tolled, echoing about in all directions, beams of light shot toward the gravestone from all directions. Within them were the seven Peak Lords, all of the Spirit Stream Sect Elders, and even the Sect Leader. They wore black robes, and as they gathered near the gravestone, their expressions were those of sorrow.As for Li Qinghou, bitterness and self-reproach filled his heart.A moment later, the Sect Leader began to speak, his voice calm and slow.\u201cBai Xiaochun was an Outer Sect disciple of Fragrant Cloud Peak in the Spirit Stream Sect. He was a blazing sun in the Dao of medicine, a Chosen among disciples. In his battle against the Luochen Clan, he killed numerous Luochen traitors, and sacrificed himself to save his fellow disciples. He was loyal to his sect, and gave his life in the most tremendous display of meritorious service. Disciples of the Spirit Stream Sect will remember his name for all eternity!\u201dHis voice was filled with grief, and as his voice echoed out, Du Lingfei\u2019s tears flowed even harder. Hou Yunfei, Big Fatty Zhang, and countless other people were all weeping.\u201cOn this day, I confer upon Bai Xiaochun the title of the Spirit Stream Sect Prestige disciple!\u201d In response to the Sect Leader\u2019s words, countless disciples were shaken. To hear the term Prestige disciple left everyone moved.That position was a matchless honor within the Spirit Stream Sect, and there could only be one Prestige disciple within the sect within any generation. It was a position higher than the Inner Sect, and on equal standing with Successor disciples. There was no greater honor for the dead.Throughout the ten-thousand-year history of the Spirit Stream Sect, there had only ever been nine disciples with such a title, each and every one of whom had been conferred with it after dying in battle for the sect. As of this moment, there were now ten such disciples in the history of the sect.Not a single person present felt the honor was inappropriate. Bai Xiaochun had earned it with his life.\u201cFrom the time he joined the sect until he sacrificed his life,\u201d continued the Sect Leader, \u201cBai Xiaochun never had a Master. Having given his life for the sect, I refuse to allow him to wander alone in the underworld. Therefore, I shall represent my dead teacher, Daoist Master Spiritsieve, to accept Bai Xiaochun as his apprentice. Henceforth, he can continue to pursue the great Dao in the underworld.\u201d In response to the Sect Leader\u2019s words, Li Qinghou nodded, pain flickering in his eyes as he looked at the gravestone.\u201cAnd now everyone\u2026 shall observe a moment of silence!\u201d With that, the Sect Leader closed his eyes. Looking at the gravestone, he bowed his head, as did all of the other disciples present.After a few breaths of time passed, the moment of silence ended. Du Lingfei couldn\u2019t hold her feelings in any longer, and began to wail.In the same moment that everyone was observing the moment of silence, back in the nameless mountain range, Bai Xiaochun slowly opened his eyes and sneezed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His mind was still in the same state it had been when he was seriously injured and fallen into a coma, so as soon as he woke up, he subconsciously cradled his left arm and let out a miserable cry. However, as soon as that cry left his lips, he looked down in surprise at his arm, and then at the rest of his body. He began to poke and prod himself, and even opened his garments and looked at his soft, white belly.\u201cEee? No injuries?\u201d Suddenly, his eyes flickered with fear as he recalled something that the old folks back in the village used to say. Supposedly, when someone died, their soul would enter the shadows of the underworld. At the moment, he obviously had no injuries, which meant that he must only be a soul.... Shivering, he looked around and realized that everything around him was dead. Even all the plants and grass were withered up. Chen Heng\u2019s corpse was nowhere to be seen.As he looked around, he also noticed fog everywhere. He couldn\u2019t see much at all, and everything past a certain distance was a complete blur. A faint aura of death pulsed in the area, causing a cold sensation to wash through his body.\u201cThat\u2019s it. It's over.... I was so careful for most of my poor little life, only to end up losing it....\u201d Bai Xiaochun was now even more certain that he was now a lost soul. His face twisted bitterly, and he let out an anguished moan.\u201cI never even got to give Du Lingfei a chance to pay me back with all her heart.... Elder Brother Hou still has his promise to keep.... People still don\u2019t know that I'm Lord Turtle, and there are still lots of spirit tail chickens to eat in the world. I... I haven\u2019t lived forever yet....\u201d The more he thought about it, the more it hurt inside. Tears began to well up in his eyes.However, even as he began to wail loudly... someone cleared their throat behind him.The sound came so suddenly that it startled Bai Xiaochun.\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d he shrieked, scrambling forward across the ground and then spinning around, a wooden sword appearing in his hand.He saw an old man standing over by where he had just been laying. He wore a long black robe and looked almost like a corpse as he stared at Bai Xiaochun in a very ghastly manner.His body radiated a strong aura of death. Coupled with the copious amounts of wrinkles which covered his pale face, he seemed like he had just climbed up out of the grave. He perfectly matched his surroundings, and looked utterly horrifying.As soon as Bai Xiaochun laid eyes on him, all the hair on his body stood on end, and he suddenly recalled countless scary stories about murderous ghosts. But then he realized that if he himself was dead, then he didn\u2019t have anything to worry about. Sticking his jaw out, he gave a cold harrumph and then slowly rose to his feet.\u201cAlright then. You\u2019re a ghost. I\u2019m a ghost. Since we\u2019re both dead and both ghosts, then who\u2019s afraid of who, huh?\u201d He walked up to the old man, then circled around him with a low-pitched, quizzical whistle.\u201cYou must be a ghost who lives in these nameless mountains. No need to be nervous. I was just passing through and happened to die. I\u2019ll be on my way in a moment. Ai. I wonder if I can continue to live forever and practice cultivation now that I\u2019ve become a ghost. Maybe I can become a ghost that lives forever.\u201d Suddenly, grief rose up once again in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart, and he sighed.The black-robed old man looked at Bai Xiaochun and frowned. Then, he spoke in a raspy voice: \u201cHow come you\u2019re not dead?\u201dBai Xiaochun started in surprise, then suddenly seemed to think of something. He bit down hard on his tongue, and when the pain coursed through him, he almost couldn\u2019t believe it. He bit down again, this time until tears poured down his cheeks. His expression lit with delight, and he literally began dancing up and down. He even threw his head back and laughed loudly.\u201cI'm not dead!! Hahaha! I, Bai Xiaochun, have a matchless cultivation base! I am invincible in heaven and earth. How could I possibly die!?\u201d He was so excited that he reached out to grab the old man\u2019s arm, except that his hand passed right through the man, and grabbed nothing but air. At the same time, his hand suddenly felt extremely cold.\u201cUh....\u201d Bai Xiaochun suddenly went stiff all over. He stared blankly at the old man, eyes wide, before screaming and leaping backward. \u201cA ghost!!\u201dBack when he thought he was dead, he didn\u2019t think much of seeing a ghost. But at the moment, he was terrified, as the stories of murderous ghosts once again began to flash through his mind.Soon, he reached the area where the fog grew thick, where he encountered some sort of invisible barrier that he could not pass through. Backing up to the barrier, he gripped his little wooden sword and stared at the old man, countless thoughts fluttering through his mind. Finally, a miserable expression filled his face.\u201cSir, do you have some unfinished business in life that I could help you take care of...?\u201dThe black-robed old man had a strange expression on his face as he studied Bai Xiaochun. He couldn\u2019t help but muse that the young man standing in front of him seemed a lot different from the steel-veined fighter from before. They almost seemed like two different people. Eventually, a thoughtful expression appeared in his eyes.\u201cPerhaps only people with personalities like this can truly cultivate the Undying Live Forever Technique....\u201d he murmured. Feeling much more at ease, he shook his head and smiled. Then he turned and began to float off into the distance.\u201cThe Undying Live Forever Technique is divided into the Undying Codex and the Live Forever Codex. Each Codex has five volumes... what you are cultivating is the most commonly circulated first volume of the Undying Codex, the Undying Skin. You\u2019ve mastered the Iron Skin, and have made headway with the Bronze Skin!\u201d As the old man floated off, his voice echoed behind him into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s ears.\u201cThe Undying Codex breaks through the five shackles of mortality. The Live Forever Codex unravels the five seals of eternity!\u201cWork hard at your cultivation. If you can reach the level of Undying Gold Skin, you will make contact with the first shackle of mortality. Whether or not you can break through that shackle will depend on your own good fortune.\u201cSince we were brought together by fate, I will give you a medicinal pill. Furthermore, to help you make a breakthrough with your Undying Skin, and achieve mastery of the Bronze Skin, I will give you this jade slip. It contains... the second volume of the Undying Codex, the Undying Heavenly King!\"If you succeed with the Undying Live Forever Technique, you can... form a Core!\u201d By this point, the old man was so far away he couldn\u2019t be seen. However, as his voice echoed out, two beams of light shot through the air and came to hover in front of Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun watched in shock as the old man left. At this point, he realized that the reason he hadn\u2019t died, and had in fact completely recovered, was because the old man had saved him.And the reason for that... was because Bai Xiaochun cultivated the Undying Live Forever Technique.Although Bai Xiaochun feared death, he took matters of favors and debts seriously. He knew that he had been injured so badly in the fight that he most likely should have died. A tremor ran through him, and, taking a deep breath, he clasped hands and bowed deeply in the direction the old man had disappeared.\u201cSenior,\u201d he called out, \u201cmany thanks for the kindness you showed in saving my life. May I respectfully ask your name...?\u201d\u201cI am... the gravekeeper,\u201d the old man replied, his voice faint and ancient, almost as if it were floating through countless years of time.It was in that exact same moment that cracking sounds could be heard from the fog as it suddenly vanished. The area which had been separated from the rest of the world was now unsealed, and returned to its place. The wind blew, lifting Bai Xiaochun\u2019s long hair as he looked off into the distance.After a moment passed, he murmured, \u201cThe Undying Live Forever Technique.... Five shackles of mortality and five seals of eternity?\u201d This was his first time hearing of such things.Finally, he took a deep breath and looked over at the medicinal pill and jade slip. He first took the jade slip, scanning it with divine sense. Inside was the second volume of the Undying Codex.He put the jade slip away and then looked over at the medicinal pill. Although he was already a journeyman apothecary, he was unable to determine the pill\u2019s quality. He took it in hand and began to examine it. He was a cautious person by nature, and he knew that if the old man in the black robe had wished to harm him, he could have done so in a variety of ways. As such, the medicinal pill would most likely bring only benefits, and would not harm him.Muttering to himself, he looked around, then put the medicinal pill away and began to walk. As he proceeded along, he looked around at the jungle, and sighed emotionally. When he thought about the whole chase and battle with the Luochen Clan cultivators, and the danger that had been involved, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of fear that remained in his heart.\u201cI wonder how Elder Sister Du and Elder Brother Hou are doing.... Did they make their escape...?\u201d At the moment, he didn\u2019t dare to use his jade slip to try to make contact with the sect. He was worried that the Luochen Clan cultivators might still be around, and would detect the fluctuations of an attempted transmission. That could lead to a big problem. Patting his bag of holding, he produced Feng Yan\u2019s windskiff, and after a quick test, confirmed that it was now functional.His eyes flashed with joy. Although he had his speculations about the current situation, he wasn\u2019t anxious to leave the area, so he found a mountain cave where he could rest for a bit. There, he produced his turtle-wok, as well as the medicinal pill given to him by the black-robed old man.Soon, silver light flashed on the medicinal pill, and three spirit designs could be seen on its surface. Bai Xiaochun picked up the pill, and his eyes gleamed with determination as he popped it into his mouth and swallowed it. Immediately, his body began to thrum, as though a burning fire were giving birth to an indescribable vital energy, which then coursed through him.He began to shake, and he gritted his teeth, unleashing the Undying Live Forever Technique. Then, he slapped himself, revealing that his skin was no longer pitch black, but instead, now contained a bit of bronze. That bronze color was reaching the point where he almost looked like a statue made of the stuff.The power inside of him grew more and more intense, and he felt stronger than ever.However, the energy of the medicine had not been exhausted. After performing the threefold spirit enhancement, the medicinal pill had reached an incredible level of quality. Even in the moment in which his skin was completely bronze, cracking sounds rang out from within him, as if something were breaking.Lines spread out rapidly across the surface of his skin, constantly increasing in number until they covered his entire body. An intense pain wracked him, but he endured, and soon, those lines began to turn silver!The Undying Skin was broken up into the levels of Iron, Bronze, Silver, and Gold!Even the black-robed old man could never have anticipated that the medicinal pill he gave to Bai Xiaochun would receive a spirit enhancement, and would thus enable him to break through not just into the Bronze Skin level, but past it.Rumbling sounds echoed out from inside Bai Xiaochun for several days. More and more cracks appeared on his skin, and soon, pieces of skin began to fall off, almost as if he were molting. Furthermore, every falling piece revealed shining silver beneath it.After ten days, the last bit of skin had fallen off. He was now completely silver, and although it was a dull silver color, when he opened his eyes, they shone with a bright silver glow.He suddenly burst into motion, causing a shocking boom to ring out. He was now at least twice as fast as he had been before!His eyes shone with joy as his right hand clenched into a fist and slammed into a nearby boulder. The boulder instantly shattered, not into large chunks, but into dust!This level of power exceeded his previous level by several times!Bai Xiaochun was panting excitedly. As of this moment, he was confident that if he fought Chen Heng again, the battle definitely wouldn\u2019t be as bitter.After some more tests, something even more shocking was revealed. His defensive levels with the Undying Silver Skin were such that even his wooden sword with the threefold spirit enhancement was incapable of even scratching it.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes shone with excitement. After ceasing the operation of the Undying Live Forever Technique, his body returned to its normal pure and fair state. He changed his clothes, then began to speed off into the distance, looking very pleased with himself.1.

    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 66: Going Through Hell Or High Water For The SecPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66: Going Through Hell or High Water for the SectAfter traveling through the jungle for a bit, Bai Xiaochun started noticing clues that told the story of what had occurred. He quickly became convinced that his suppositions were correct. After emerging from the nameless mountains, he pushed on at top speed for several days until he was back in the Fallenstar Mountains, where he discovered the ruins of the Luochen Clan. \u201cIt seems Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei really did get word back to the sect.\u201d When he thought back to the bitter events he had lived through, he sighed, then turned and leaped back up onto the Windskiff. Sitting down cross-legged, he set it whooshing off into the distance.\u201cBack to the sect!\u201d he declared, eyes shining with anticipation. Then he realized that he most certainly had performed meritorious service for the sect, and would surely be handsomely rewarded when he got back.That got him even more excited. As he traveled along, he turned his attention to his bag of holding. As he sifted through and organized all of the other bags of holding he had collected from the Luochen Clan cultivators, he found quite a few random items inside, as well as spirit stones.In one bag of holding, although he had forgotten who it had originally belonged to, he found the most valuable of all the items. It was a seed, roughly the size of a human fist. It pulsed, almost like a beating heart, as though it contained something alive. However, the beating was growing weaker and weaker.After a bit of thought, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s skill with plants and vegetation led him to a shocking conclusion. This was a valuable and legendary Spirit Seed, which had supposedly become extinct long ago. It was known as a Beastbirth Seed!According to the legends, if it absorbed another spirit creature\u2019s quintessence, it would be able to naturally reproduce that very same spirit creature. To those powerful beasts which had difficulty reproducing, Beastbirth Seeds like this were virtually priceless.It was the same for cultivators who had powerful spirit creature pets. Cultivators like that all thirsted to possess successive generations of their powerful spirit creatures. Unfortunately, they were usually limited to a single pet, which meant that Beastbirth Seeds were incredibly valuable to them.It was impossible to say how the enemy Luochen Clan cultivator had come to possess such a valuable item. Presumably, it was some type of good fortune that person had come across. After all, the Luochen Clan had been located in the Fallenstar Mountains, a place\u2026 of boundless mysteries.After some more thought, Bai Xiaochun came to the conclusion that whichever Luochen Clan cultivator discovered the Beastbirth Seed likely didn\u2019t know what it was, which would explain why it hadn\u2019t been maintained properly.Along the way, Bai Xiaochun picked up some wood which was infused with spiritual energy. After carving it into a little box, he carefully placed the Beastbirth Seed into it, where upon the seed\u2019s life force fluctuations gradually stabilized.Bai Xiaochun put the wooden box away and took a deep breath. Then, he sent the Windskiff speeding over the horizon, following the same path they had originally taken, to make his way closer and closer to the Spirit Stream Sect.A month passed by quickly enough. On the original trip, they hadn\u2019t possessed very many spirit stones, and thus had only used the Windskiff at night. But now, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bag of holding was bulging with spirit stones, and he wasn\u2019t worried at all about wasting them. Therefore, it only took a month before the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s south bank gate came into view.\u201cIt\u2019s been more than half a year since I left. Finally, I\u2019m back.\u201d Bai Xiaochun stood atop the Windskiff, hair whipping in the wind, looking every bit like a powerful master. However, he suddenly decided that it was the wrong image, and quickly changed back into the dilapidated, blood-stained Outer Sect disciple\u2019s robe that he had worn during his desperate battle with the Luochen Clan.Now he looked like someone who had been willing to fight to the death for the sect. Upon his return, the bloodstains on his garments, and the various places where the cloth had been ripped and punctured, would bear clear witness to the dangerous crises he had faced.Feeling very pleased, he sent the Windskiff even closer to the sect. However, just when he was about to cross the border, an invisible barrier appeared, sending the Windskiff bouncing backward.\u201cHuh?\u201d he thought. The force of the rebound almost knocked him off the Windskiff.It was at this point that a beam of light suddenly shot toward him from the main gate. A young man appeared, expression placid as he looked at Bai Xiaochun.\u201cUnknown Fellow Daoist, what brings you to the Spirit Stream Sect?\u201d Even as the words left his mouth, he looked at the Windskiff, and then at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s clothes, and his brow furrowed. \u201cYou have a Spirit Stream Sect Windskiff, and you\u2019re wearing the robes of an Outer Sect disciple? Plus the main gate of the spirit Stream Sect prevented you from entering?! Who are you?!\u201dThe young man\u2019s eyes glittered coldly as he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand. Instantly, his cultivation base surged with the fluctuations of the eighth level of Qi Condensation.Bai Xiaochun backed up, looking at the shield in confusion.\u201cElder Brother,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s going on? Why can\u2019t I enter the sect? I\u2019m Outer Sect disciple Bai Xiaochun from Fragrant Cloud Peak!\u201dThe young man frowned, and just when he was about to say something, he started in surprise.\u201cWait, you\u2019re Bai Xiaochun?\u201d The more he studied Bai Xiaochun, the more familiar he looked. He had attended Bai Xiaochun\u2019s funeral service, in which his portrait had been on display above his gravestone. At tremor ran through the young man, and when he realized that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s garments were stained with blood, he gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re not dead?!?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not dead at all!\u201d Even as Bai Xiaochun stared in surprise, the young man excitedly pulled out a jade slip and sent a message back to the sect.As the news about Bai Xiaochun was being sent back, Li Qinghou was in secluded meditation on Fragrant Cloud Peak. Suddenly, his eyes opened, and a tremor ran through him.At the same time, the news was passed to the Sect Leader, whose jaw dropped. He immediately sent a stream of divine sense out to the main gate of the south bank, and when he saw Bai Xiaochun, he was first shocked, then delighted. He immediately began to send notifications out into the sect.It only took a few breaths of time for gasps of disbelief to begin to rise up. The collective sound was so loud that it was even faintly audible outside of the main gate. Furthermore, bells began to toll.\u201cBai Xiaochun? Didn\u2019t he die? How could he be alive?!?!\u201dCountless people began to fly out from within the sect. Somewhat surprisingly, the very first in line was Hou Yunfei. When he emerged from the main gate and saw Bai Xiaochun, an expression of disbelief appeared on his face. After the deadly chase they had both participated in, he never wanted to believe that Bai Xiaochun was actually dead. However, deep in his heart, he was sure that no disciple could have been made it out of such a bitter situation.Now, he was so excited he began to cry.\u201cJunior Brother Bai!!\u201d he cried. Laughing, he rushed forward and embraced Bai Xiaochun.\u201cElder Brother Hou\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied, blinking. By this point, he realized that the sect had thought him to be dead. He looked at Hou Yunfei, eyes brimming with happiness.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get back to the sect!\u201d Hou Yunfei said excitedly. He grabbed Bai Xiaochun and immediately headed back through the main gate. With Hou Yunfei there, Bai Xiaochun could now enter the sect. As for the young man from earlier, he followed along, clearly shaken. He had personally participated in the extermination of the Luochen Clan, and had seen the evidence of the battle fought by Bai Xiaochun, including the mangled corpses of the Luochen Clan cultivators. To see that Bai Xiaochun had returned alive left him deeply astonished.Almost as soon as Bai Xiaochun walked through the front gate, more people began to rush toward him from all directions.\u201cNinth Fatty?!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang, Third Fatty Hei, and the other Fatty Elder Brothers from the servants district were so happy they were shaking. That was especially true of Big Fatty Zhang, who gave Bai Xiaochun a big bear hug, tears streaming down his face.Bai Xiaochun was moved. Seeing how many people were crowding around him, he suddenly felt as if everything he\u2019d done really had been worth it.Then, a beam of light flew over, which was Li Qinghou, who had an incredulous look on his face as he looked at Bai Xiaochun. In his hands was a bag, within which were all the bloodstained scraps of clothing he had gathered up when searching for Bai Xiaochun.He more than anyone understood the grave and deadly peril Bai Xiaochun had faced.Bai Xiaochun hurried forward, clasping hands and bowing to Li Qinghou. \u201cGreetings, Peak Lord!\u201dLi Qinghou was normally a very calm person, but right now he couldn\u2019t stop himself from trembling. Reaching out, he placed his hand on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s head and said, \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re alive,\u201d Li Qinghou said. \u201cJust glad you\u2019re alive.\u201d\u201cThis is my home!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, puffing his chest out. \u201cI\u2019m willing to go through hell or high water for the sect!\u201d Then he waved his sleeve, deliberately revealing the numerous blood-stained holes in it.People continued to stream over from all three of the south bank\u2019s mountain peaks. Everyone wanted to see Bai Xiaochun, and when they saw his dilapidated, blood-stained clothing, they were shocked.That was especially true when people began to spread the words he had just spoken. Everyone was shaken, and when they looked at Bai Xiaochun, in their hearts they felt\u2026 that he was a true sect Chosen.As the crowd built, the weeping voice of a young woman could be heard. It was none other than Du Lingfei. She had spent the recent days awash with tears, to the point where she had even lost weight. When she heard people saying that Bai Xiaochun had returned, her mind began to thrum, and she instantly dropped everything and raced over.When she actually laid eyes on Bai Xiaochun, even more tears began to flow. She hurried over and wrapped her arms around him, crying and laughing and the same time. She almost didn\u2019t seem to dare to believe that what she was seeing was true. In response, Bai Xiaochun felt a warm sensation in his heart.His hands almost began to move in the direction of certain bulging areas of her clothing, but then he remembered that there were lots of people watching, and he held back.\u201cIt\u2019s like I said, Elder Sister Du,\u201d he said coolly, lifting his chin, \u201cif I, Bai Xiaochun, have only one breath of air left, I would never let anyone harm you.\u201d As the sappy words left his mouth, he seemed like he was looking down on the entire world.However, Du Lingfei went a bit limp, and deep within her eyes, the hidden emotions therein turned even sweeter than before.People from the Hall of Justice were also there, led by Ouyang Jie. When he saw Bai Xiaochun, he looked shocked for a moment, but then profoundly pleased. That was especially true when he saw Bai Xiaochun\u2019s tattered state, and then heard the words he had just spoken to Li Qinghou, upon which he nodded his head.\u201cBai Xiaochun, I am Ouyang Jie from the Hall of Justice.\u201dWhen Bai Xiaochun heard the words \u2018Hall of Justice\u2019, his heart thumped, but then he thought back to the incredible service he had performed. Chest puffed out just like before, he clasped hands respectfully to Ouyang Jie.Ouyang Jie rarely smiled, but he was smiling now as he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back with me to see the Sect Leader and talk about what happened with the Luochen Clan?\u201dHe waved his finger in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction, causing a spirit fog to appear beneath his feet, which sent him flying off into the distance with Ouyang Jie.Li Qinghou looked profoundly glad as he transformed into a beam of light that also shot away with them.As for all the other disciples, they watched Bai Xiaochun leave, and most heaved surprised sighs, and began to discuss the matter amongst themselves as they dispersed. Of course, the news about Bai Xiaochun being alive spread rapidly.Eventually, virtually everyone in the Spirit Stream Sect came to know of the matter. Most people were very happy, but back in his Immortal\u2019s cave, Qian Dajin was shaking, and a look of terror could be seen on his face.\u201cDammit, I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s not dead!! How could he have escaped from such deadly pursuit!?\u201cHe probably doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m the one who arranged for him to go on that mission though\u2026. Right? There\u2019s no way he could know\u2026.\u201d Various expressions flashed across Qian Dajin\u2019s face. Finally, he sighed, thinking about all the possible bad things that could happen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 69": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 67: Elder Brother, Where\u2019s Our Master?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 67: Elder Brother, Where\u2019s our Master?The Spirit Stream Sect had eight mountain peaks. Four were on the north bank, three were on the south bank, and one was in the middle\u2026. That was Mount Daoseed, which was the public seat of the sect\u2019s power. Normally, Spirit Stream Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong would handle sect affairs from that very location.Currently, bells were tolling as the Lords of the various mountain peaks of the north and south bank sat tall and straight in the main temple hall. The Sect Leader was also there, sitting in the center position.Soon, Li Qinghou and Ouyang Jie arrived with Bai Xiaochun. They left Bai Xiaochun outside of the temple hall, telling him to wait there as they went in.There were four disciples stationed as guards outside the temple, who cast curious glances Bai Xiaochun\u2019s way.Bai Xiaochun smiled back at them. This was his first time coming to this place; the spiritual energy was abundant, and the fragrant aroma of plants and flowers filled the air. There were no extraneous sounds in the air; everything was calm and quiet, much different than Fragrant Cloud Peak.This was a very important place in the sect, and normally, any disciple who came here would act very cautious and discreet. However, Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t seem to feel any pressure at all, and stood there looking very much at ease.The four disciples couldn\u2019t help but sigh at this, and muse that Bai Xiaochun really did deserve to be known as a big shot in the sect, someone who had performed an incredible service. After all, ordinary people could never act so casually in a place like this.The truth was that although Bai Xiaochun feared death, after considering the meritorious service he had performed, he knew that he wouldn\u2019t be dying here. Therefore, it was only natural that he wouldn\u2019t be afraid. He stuck out his chest, heart filled with anticipation over what his reward might be.\u201cConsidering the level of service I provided for the sect, they\u2019ll have to give me a medicinal pill to increase my longevity by a hundred years. They\u2019ll most likely give me 1,000,000 merit points too, and probably an incredible Immortal\u2019s cave. I\u2019m sure to be promoted to the Inner Sect as well. Hahaha.\u201d The more he thought about it, the more excited he got. After a long moment passed, however, no word came calling him into the temple.Bai Xiaochun was a bit taken aback. He continued to wait until he was yawning before, finally, a voice spoke in a somewhat begrudging tone.\u201cBai Xiaochun, come in.\u201dHis spirits instantly lifted. Taking a deep breath, he tried to look like the picture of a disciple who would go through hell or high water for his sect. Striding into the main temple, he clasped hands and bowed.\u201cDisciple Bai Xiaochun from Fragrant Cloud Peak, at your service. Greetings, Sect Leader. Greetings, other Senior members of the sect.\u201dAfter offering formal greetings, Bai Xiaochun looked up. He immediately caught sight of an old man sitting in the middle of the group. He looked threatening without being angry, and wore a long white robe. His cultivation base was completely unreadable.He was surrounded by eight others, a group of six men and two women. Li Qinghou and Ouyang Jie were among them, and all of them seemed to be measuring up this Bai Xiaochun who had somehow returned alive.Their eyes lingered on his garments. Considering the power of their eyesight, it was instantly obvious to them that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s clothing had not been intentionally torn, but that he had truly experienced a deadly battle.They also noticed how pure and fair he seemed. He spoke courteously, and was neither haughty nor overly humble. From the expression on his face, he seemed completely at ease.Although none of them reacted at all to what they were seeing, inwardly, their impressions of Bai Xiaochun improved even more. However, a few were still somewhat suspicious of exactly what had occurred.Li Qinghou looked at Bai Xiaochun and then slowly said, \u201cBai Xiaochun, please explain in detail everything involved with the mission to the Luochen Clan, from start to finish.\u201dLooking very serious, Bai Xiaochun calmly recounted everything that had occurred, from beginning to end. He left out the incident with the black-robed old man; that was his secret to keep.He wove Feng Yan sacrificing himself into the story, as well as the various difficulties they had faced. He was an intelligent person, so he didn\u2019t mention anything at all of what he had done that was worthy of merit, but instead continued to praise Feng Yan, Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei.\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault for being useless,\u201d he said. \u201cElder Brother Feng died trying to save me. It\u2019s all my fault\u2026.\u201dThe more he went on in this way, the more the Sect Leader and the others\u2019 eyes shone with approval. Of course, these people had practiced cultivation for many years, and were as crafty as devils. From the moment Bai Xiaochun came back wearing that one particular set of clothing, they could tell what type of person he was. Even so, their praise only continued to grow.\u201cAfter he lost consciousness, he just woke up all healed?\u201d the Sect Leader thought, smiling. He didn\u2019t mind this version of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s explanation. After all, disciples always had secrets to maintain. It was best for them to feel like they belonged in the sect, and exercising absolute control of every aspect of their lives would only serve to have the opposite effect.After the story was finished, the Sect Leader said, \u201cBai Xiaochun, your reward was already announced several months ago. Back then, you became the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s\u2026 Prestige disciple!\u201dWhen the Sect Leader actually spoke the words \u2018Prestige disciple\u2019, a strange feeling rose up in his heart. After all, this was the first time there had ever been a living Prestige disciple.That was one of the reasons why the discussion had been so difficult earlier. The position of Prestige disciple was extremely important, and had previously only been conferred upon people who had died in battle, never living disciples. And yet, here Bai Xiaochun was right in front of them, healthy and no worse for wear\u2026.That was one reason why all of them had been so shocked to hear the news that he was alive.Furthermore, it was a status that could not just be stripped away. The funeral service had been carried out, and the meritorious service performed. The group had been somewhat perplexed about what to do, and thus had left Bai Xiaochun waiting outside for some time.After much discussion, they decided that there was no way to change what had already been announced. In accordance with the sect rules, they would allow Bai Xiaochun to keep that position.\u201cPrestige disciple?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked, looking shocked. He had never heard of any such title before, so he simply stood there, looking blankly at the Sect Leader and the other Senior sect members. Although all of them had strange expressions on their faces, they didn\u2019t say anything else regarding a reward.Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t hold back from asking, \u201cUh\u2026 that\u2019s it?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d replied the Sect Leader, smiling.Bai Xiaochun instantly started to get nervous, and then prepared to start explaining how difficult the journey had been, how many times he had almost died. Before he could start, Li Qinghou, who knew Bai Xiaochun better than anyone, cleared his throat and said, \u201cHurry up and thank the Sect Leader. The title of Prestige disciple has only been given out ten times throughout the history of the Spirit Stream Sect. You are the only person to get it within the past thousand years.\u201cAs the Prestige disciple, you rank higher than the Inner Sect, and have the most prestigious glory in the entire Spirit Stream Sect. Your descendants will all have special access to sect resources, and will be Inner Sect disciples from birth. The Spirit Stream Sect will protect your bloodline for all eternity!\u201cCurrently, there are nine great clans who are part of the Spirit Stream Sect, and all of them are Prestige clans. It\u2019s a truly glorious and honorable position.\u201dWhen Bai Xiaochun heard the explanation, a somewhat sad expression appeared on his face. His spirits suddenly sank, and he looked miserably at Li Qinghou, then back at the Sect Leader.He wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Although the position of Prestige disciple seemed incredible, the truth was that it had been created for the descendants of people who had died. But he was still alive\u2026. Sadly, Bai Xiaochun was now in the unfortunate position of being jealous of his own progeny.\u201cThanks\u2026 Sect Leader\u2026.\u201d he said sadly, lacking the energy to even speak.Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong cleared his throat awkwardly. \u201cFrom this day on, you may address me as Elder Brother Sect Leader.\u201dThe matter of having Bai Xiaochun become the apprentice of his own master had been made because he assumed Bai Xiaochun had sacrificed his life. But now that he was alive, it led to a very awkward situation. The Sect Leader, despite having many years of life under his belt, would now have a twenty-year-old kid calling him Elder Brother. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh inwardly.\u201cReally?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked, his eyes widening. All of a sudden, he felt much, much better. He had entered the temple hall with high expectations, only to have them cruelly crushed. That led to him being in a horrible mood. But now, things had changed.\u201cBased on the meritorious service you performed, and considering that you had no formal Master, I took the responsibility to accept you as an apprentice of my own Master. Therefore, from now on you can call me Elder Brother.\u201d The Sect Leader couldn\u2019t feel more awkward.Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, and his eyes filled with excitement. He suddenly was filled with the sensation that the sect truly had treated him well. The Sect Leader\u2019s Master would most definitely be ranked as a Prime Elder in the sect, which caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes to radiate with excitement.\u201cFrom now on,\u201d he thought, \u201cnobody will dare to bully me, not with an awesome Master like that! Hahaha!!\u201d Heart leaping with joy, he clasped hands and bowed deeply.\u201cMany thanks, Elder Brother Sect Leader,\u201d he said, sounding elated. \u201cElder Brother Sect Leader, where exactly is our Master? I would love to go pay my respects.\u201dA strange expression could be seen on the Sect Leader\u2019s face as he slowly said, \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry in that. There was a portrait made of him before he passed away in meditation, which was enshrined on the back side of the mountain. I\u2019ve already made arrangements for some people to escort you over there shortly.\u201dBai Xiaochun felt as if he were being struck by lighting. \u201cPassed away in meditation\u2026. Enshrined on the back side of the mountain\u2026.\u201dHis jaw dropped as the words he had just spoken echoed in his mind. After a long moment, he pulled himself together\u2026. The Master he had become apprenticed to\u2026 had already passed away.\u201cI\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was now starting to seethe with anger, and his mind was buzzing. Once again his heart sank, and he wanted to cry, although no tears would come. It was in a virtual daze that he allowed himself to be led to the rear of the mountain, where he paid formal respects to the portrait of his Master. Afterward, he left Mount Daoseed and returned to Fragrant Cloud Peak.On Fragrant Cloud Peak, numerous disciples hurried over to offer greetings. Curious expressions could be seen in their eyes, and someone even kindly took him over to look at his own gravestone.When Bai Xiaochun saw the gravestone, everything seemed to go black.Eventually, he found himself back in his courtyard, sitting blankly in his log cabin, rage building up within him. \u201cI\u2026 I became the apprentice of a painting\u2026.\u201dSeveral days later, he was still there, looking miserable. Half a month passed before he managed to collect himself.Sighing miserably, he left his residence to look for Big Fatty Zhang, to reminisce about the past. However, as soon as he walked out, he ran into an Outer Sect disciple who instantly clasped hands and bowed deeply.\u201cGreetings, Sect Uncle Bai.\u201dBai Xiaochun took a few more steps, then stopped and turned around, eyes shining as he grabbed the Outer Sect disciple and pulled him forward.\u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d\u201cSect Uncle Bai!\u201d the Outer Sect disciple instantly replied. \u201cSir, you\u2019re the Junior Brother of the Sect Leader. D-disciple would naturally call you Elder Uncle Bai!\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s fists loosened, and his eyes began to shine even more brightly. His heart also started pounding. This new status of his wasn\u2019t all that bad after all. He had a terrifying level of seniority\u2026.Licking his lips, he began to laugh, which frightened the Outer Sect disciple so much that he started to edge backward, unsure of what madness had struck Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun suddenly stopped laughing. Clearing his throat, he put on the air of a Senior sect member and nodded slightly at the Outer Sect disciple. Instead of going to look for Big Fatty Zhang, it was with keen anticipation that he headed toward the Missions Office.Because\u2026 that was where the most people would be.Meanwhile, Li Qinghou had returned to Fragrant Cloud Peak, and was in secluded meditation. After seating himself cross-legged, he thought for a bit, and then waved his sleeve. Expression serious, he began to concoct pills.\u201cXiaochun is stubborn and mischievous. I need to prepare a life-saving magical item for him. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not very good at equipment forging, but I can make a batch of Nine Ultimates Pills to trade with the Pill Stream Sect\u2026. When they find out I\u2019m preparing a magical item for a Qi Condensation disciple, and a younger relative at that, they\u2019ll definitely rip me off.\u201d Li Qinghou shook his head, but didn\u2019t mind. In order to concoct Nine Ultimates Pills, he would have to use some of his own heart-blood, but when the thought about how close Bai Xiaochun had come to dying, he settled his qi, cleared his mind, and began preparations to start concocting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that he had discovered the joy in being the Junior Brother of the Sect Leader, he couldn\u2019t be more happy. He strutted along the mountain paths of the sect until he saw the Missions Office off in the distance.Clearing his throat, he straightened his garments and assumed the air of a Senior member of the sect. Sticking his chin out, he clasped his hands behind his back and sauntered forward.The Missions Office was one of the busiest places in the sect, and today it was as packed as usual. The clamor of Outer Sect disciples coming and going could be heard from quite a distance away.When Bai Xiaochun arrived, he stood there with a benevolent smile on his face, looking around at all the Outer Sect disciples.Almost as soon as he appeared, people noticed, and the disciples nearest to him, who were in the middle of discussing various mission-related topics, suddenly gaped.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s Sect Uncle Bai! Greetings, Sect Uncle Bai!\u201dClasping hands in his direction, they called out, \u201cGreetings, Sect Uncle Bai!\u201dAfter hearing them, more people looked over, and soon, virtually all of the Outer Sect disciples in the area were clasping hands in greeting.Bursting with joy at hearing everyone call him Sect Uncle Bai, he strode forward, smiling, hands clasped behind his back as he said, \u201cKeep up the good work, everyone.\u201dThe surrounding disciples looked at him enviously and began to murmur among themselves.\u201cWow, Sect Uncle Bai is the Sect Leader\u2019s Junior Brother\u2026.\u201dThere were a few Honor Guards stationed at the Missions Office, and when they saw Bai Xiaochun walking up, they hastily rose to their feet and clasped hands in greeting. Virtually the entire Missions Office lurched to a halt as everyone turned to look. Bai Xiaochun was only getting more exciting.\u201cCarry on, everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry about me. I\u2019m just here on behalf of Elder Brother Sect Leader to inspect the Outer Sect disciples of the Spirit Stream Sect.\u201d Happiness blossomed in the depths of his heart. In response to his words, the surrounding disciples once again clasped hands, and even the Elders from the Missions Office came out and nodded politely to him.However\u2026 although Bai Xiaochun had clearly told them not to pay him any heed, he didn\u2019t leave. He strolled through the crowd, nodding to those he recognized and reveling in their calls of \u2018Sect Uncle Bai.\u2019 Some of the disciples even said it ten times\u2026.Soon, strange looks appeared on their faces as they realized that apparently, Bai Xiaochun had actually come to hear them call him Sect Uncle Bai\u2026. In the end, he decided not to push things too far. Waving at everyone, he swaggered away, and soon the Missions Office returned to its normal state of affairs.\u201cWhat an awesome status,\u201d he thought, his eyes shining. Not only did he feel incredibly happy, most importantly, he could tell that his status was vastly removed from everyone else.\u201cPrestige disciple. Junior Brother of the Sect Leader. Might as well just say that nobody in the sect will ever dare to provoke me, right?\u201d Having reached this point in his train of thoughts, Bai Xiaochun laughed heartily and hurried off in the direction of the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion.The 10,000 Medicines Pavilion\u2026 was also packed.It didn\u2019t take long for him to get there, and when he did, he looked up at the ten stone steles and listened to everyone call him Sect Uncle Bai. He stood there for quite a while, sighing, until strange expressions began to appear on the faces of the disciples. Reluctantly, he left. By that time, evening was falling, but he didn\u2019t feel tired at all, and went over to one of the locations where a lot of Outer Sect disciples resided.Xu Baocai had just stepped out, and when he saw Bai Xiaochun, he immediately clasped hands.Bai Xiaochun thumped Xu Baocai on the shoulder and then spoke in a wise, reprimanding tone. \u201cAh, it\u2019s you, Little Treasure! After all the time I\u2019ve been gone, you haven\u2019t made much progress with your cultivation base! We can\u2019t have that! You need to work hard at your cultivation!\u201dXu Baocai\u2019s jaw dropped, and he blinked. His heart trembled a bit after hearing Bai Xiaochun call him \u2018Little Treasure\u2019. At this age, only his father would call him something like that, and even then, only in private. Despite feeling a bit odd, he didn\u2019t dare to say anything, and merely nodded in assent. 1\u201cI\u2026 um, I mean, as an important person like myself\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun suddenly realized that with a position like his, it would be improper to simply refer to himself as \u201cI\u201d, and so he decided to try to make himself sound like an important person, like Li Qinghou. He cleared his throat. Clasping his hands behind his back, he stuck his jaw out and said, \u201cAs an important person like myself, I\u2019m not very familiar with this area. Could you show me around a bit?\u201dXu Baocai had no choice but to immediately begin to show Bai Xiaochun around.More and more disciples were returning home, and when they caught sight Bai Xiaochun, they looked a bit surprised. Many of them had already seen him earlier at the Missions Office and the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion. Seeing him here caused them to exchange quizzical glances. However, they had no other option than to clasp hands and offer greetings.Bai Xiaochun once again revelled in the glory of this status. Joy surged in his heart at the sight of one Outer Sect disciple after another offering greetings. It was late at night before he finally left, feeling very pleased with himself.As he walked along, he saw the Spirit Tail Chicken farm, and decided to stop by. Before long, calls of \u2018Sect Uncle Bai\u2019 could be heard. When he left, he held two Spirit Tail Chickens in his hands.\u201cAh, the perks of having status. When I wanted to eat chickens before, I had to steal them. Now I can just take them openly. Who would dare to provoke me now, huh? My Elder Brother is the Sect Leader!\u201d Bai Xiaochun hummed a little tune as he strolled back to his residence, emanating an air of pride and complacency.Early the next morning, when the sun had just risen, Bai Xiaochun crawled out of bed, feeling in very high spirits. Straightening his clothes, he looked at himself in his copper mirror and selected the best pose he could come up with, then stepped out.Then he went about doing things in a very serious way, as if it were\u2026 his job\u2026.He didn\u2019t go to the Missions Office, but instead, visited many other locations on Fragrant Cloud Peak. He even went to watch the fighting competition\u2026.Throughout the day, he heard countless people call him Sect Uncle Bai. To him, it was almost as if he had become an Immortal. His spirits were so high he nearly burst. And then\u2026 the third day arrived. Then the fourth, and the fifth\u2026.He strolled around the sect for more than ten days in a row. By that point, virtually all of the Outer Sect disciples on Fragrant Cloud Peak had called him Sect Uncle Bai, and were on the verge of going crazy. To call a kid like him Sect Uncle might be fine if it only happened once. But the more they had to call it out, the worse they felt.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s days were long and fulfilling, and he especially liked it when he ran into people he knew. He would quickly hurry over and call out a greeting\u2026.One day he saw Zhao Yiduo. Eyes shining, he hurried over and grabbed his arm and said, \u201cSect Nephew Yiduo, long time no see! Don\u2019t rush off!\u201dWhen Zhao Yiduo heard the term \u2018Sect Nephew\u2019, his face twitched. \u201cSect Uncle Bai, we\u2019ve\u2026 we\u2019ve run into each other several times in the past few days\u2026.\u201dBai Xiaochun blinked, then cleared his throat. It was at that point that he saw someone else nearby, someone who had noticed him and was just turning to leave.\u201cEee?\u201d he said. \u201cSect Nephew Zi\u2019ang, long time no see!\u201d He quickly released Zhao Yiduo and hurried over to stand in front of Chen Zi\u2019ang, face beaming.Chen Zi\u2019ang seemed to be on the verge of going mad. He had run into Bai Xiaochun every day recently, usually at least three times\u2026. From what he had heard, it was the same with everyone who personally knew Bai Xiaochun. The person who had it worst of all was an unlucky fellow who called himself Lord Wolf, who supposedly was visited by Bai Xiaochun dozens of times per day\u2026.\u201cSect Uncle Bai, uh\u2026 I have something to take care of, I have to run.\u201d Chen Zi\u2019ang promptly fled as though his life depended on it.Ten days later, the Outer Sect disciples on Fragrant Cloud Peak had begun to pretend not to notice Bai Xiaochun. That of course left him less than pleased, and forced him to take the initiative more often.Bai Xiaochun grabbed one of Zhou Xinqi\u2019s former fans and said, \u201cAiya! You seem so familiar! Come, come, as an important person like myself, I sometimes forget things. Have we met already?\u201dThe disciple looked downright wretched as Bai Xiaochun began to chat with him. After enough time passed for an incense stick to burn, and after the disciple had called him Sect Uncle Bai more than thirty times, Bai Xiaochun finally seemed pleased, and allowed the miserable-looking disciple to leave.However, such a strategy wasn\u2019t really viable long-term. After realizing that everyone was avoiding him, he decided that he needed to take more initiative. In the following days, he would frequently clear his throat to alert people to his presence.The results were only average, leaving Bai Xiaochun feeling quite down. Thankfully, there was another girl besides Du Lingfei whom Bai Xiaochun found quite charming.It was Hou Xiaomei, who would take the initiative to come find him every day. There was no need for him to clear his throat; she was so enthusiastic she could hardly stand still in front of him, and would follow him around fawningly and call him Sect Uncle.The other Outer Sect disciples felt a bit sick when they saw that, but Bai Xiaochun was delighted. Some time ago, Bai Xiaochun had provided her with some education regarding the mysterious little turtle of Fragrant Cloud Peak. She still adored the little turtle, and on one occasion when she was walking around with Bai Xiaochun, she asked him what he thought of the little turtle.\u201cThe little turtle? He\u2019s mysterious and unfathomable. He is naturally talented, and in the 10,000 year history of the Spirit Stream Sect, he is a rarely-seen, grandiose figure. He\u2019s like a white cloud in a clear sky, someone that everyone can look up to!\u201d In the end, he coughed dryly. After uttering such grandiose words, Bai Xiaochun had to work hard not to just blurt out to Hou Xiaomei that he was the little turtle. However, he was still determined to find a time when he was the focus of all attention to tell Hou Xiaomei about his grand identity.\u201cI feel the same way,\u201d Hou Xiaomei responded, eyes glittering brightly. \u201cI\u2019ve told a lot of people that the little turtle is oblivious to material rewards. He pursues the Dao of medicine, and does not worry himself with worldly matters. He\u2019s definitely like a white cloud in a clear sky.\u201dFor a while, there had been a lot of rumors that Bai Xiaochun was the little turtle. However, those rumors had eventually been refuted. Everyone had an idea of what they thought the little turtle looked like, and it definitely wasn\u2019t Bai Xiaochun.The fact that Hou Xiaomei responded in such a way didn\u2019t really register to Bai Xiaochun. He was currently thinking about one of the top five beauties of the south bank, Zhou Xinqi.\u201cI wonder what it would be like to hear a proud Chosen like Zhou Xinqi call me Sect Uncle?\u201d he thought. The mere idea got him excited, and from that day on, he began to search relentlessly for Zhou Xinqi.As the saying goes, everything comes to him who waits. One day, he looked up and happened to see Zhou Xinqi soaring through the air on her blue flying silk.\u201cSect Niece Xinqi!!\u201d he shouted.Zhou Xinqi\u2019s face twisted into an unsightly expression. She had heard about what Bai Xiaochun had been doing during the past month, and knew that all of the Outer Sect disciples had been talking about the matter in fearful tones. When the words \u201cSect Niece Xinqi\u201d entered her ears, goosebumps sprang up all over her body. She immediately pretended as if she hadn\u2019t heard him and proceeded along her way. However, how could she have imagined\u2026 that Bai Xiaochun would stubbornly run along beneath her, crying out at the top of his lungs.\u201cSect Niece Xinqi, come on, have a chat with your Sect Uncle about life!\u201d He was actually bursting with excitement; he had been looking for Zhou Xinqi for quite some time, and having finally run into her, there was no way he would simply give up.Zhou Xinqi gritted her teeth and picked up speed. It was only by leaving Fragrant Cloud Peak that she was finally able to shake him.Bai Xiaochun watched as she flew away, and sighed with regret.\u201cAh it doesn\u2019t matter. You can fly, but I\u2019ll be able to fly eventually too. One of these days, I\u2019ll get you to call me Sect Uncle Bai.\u201d Feeling a bit depressed, he looked up at the darkening sky and then went to look for Du Lingfei.As soon as she saw him coming, she covered her mouth with her hand as she laughed. \u201cSect Uncle Bai, Sect Uncle Bai, Sect Uncle Bai\u2026.\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s spirits instantly soared because of Du Lingfei\u2019s charmingness. A few days before, one of the sect Elders had taken her as an apprentice because of the services she had rendered. Then she had been assigned to Eastwood City to serve as the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s Honor Guard there. It was a great opportunity for Du Lingfei; after spending a few years in Eastwood City, considering her past experience and meritorious service, she would be directly promoted into the Inner Sect.Furthermore, she would have lot of authority in Eastwood City, and access to even more abundant cultivation resources than were available in the main sect.Bai Xiaochun sighed with regret as he saw her off. Then he continued to wander around Fragrant Cloud Peak looking for interesting things to do.Time passed. A month later, the words \u2018Sect Uncle Bai\u2019 had become somewhat taboo. Whenever anyone thought of them, they would laugh bitterly.By that point, Bai Xiaochun finally came to the conclusion that it was time to call an end to the matter.\u201cI, Bai Xiaochun, am the Junior Brother of the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s Sect Leader. I am the Sect Uncle to all disciples, not just the disciples on Fragrant Cloud Peak. I can\u2019t discriminate against the other mountain peaks. I need to go visit them too.\u201d After a bit of thought, he decided that it truly was the right thing to do. Thus, he headed toward Violet Cauldron Peak.Important note: As of this chapter I am officially going on a short hiatus for A Will Eternal to focus fully on my other project, I Shall Seal the Heavens. As most of you probably know, the translation of ISSTH will be completed on July 1, slightly more than a month from when this chapter is being posted. Some time after that, I will be translating A Will Eternal as my main project, and the number of chapters posted per week will increase dramatically. Unfortunately, that won\u2019t be happening on July 2. As I mentioned in other announcements and videos, after ISSTH is finished, I\u2019ll be taking my first break from translating in over two years. One of the things I plan to do during that time is read AWE in Chinese in its entirety, or at least get several hundred chapters ahead. Up to now I\u2019ve been translating as I go along, which not only makes things go slower, it can lead to mistakes in the translation because of misunderstanding certain passages that don\u2019t get explained for dozens or hundreds of chapters. There are already a few things I\u2019ve come across that I needed to look as far as 300-400 chapters ahead to get an explanation. And those were things I went looking for; who knows what other things might be lurking in future chapters that I didn\u2019t think to check into. As of the posting of this chapter, AWE is still being written by Er Gen, and hasn\u2019t quite reached 800 chapters. Given the standard length of Er Gen novels, that means the story is probably only about half done, with something like a year left before it\u2019s finished. During my hiatus from AWE, you can contact me on Twitter or Facebook if you have any questions.1.

    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 69: Bai Xiaochun, Come Offer Greetings To The Young LordPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69: Bai Xiaochun, Come Offer Greetings to the Young LordOne month later, the Outer Sect disciples on Violet Cauldron Peak were about to go crazy. Bai Xiaochun had virtually made a career out of being a Sect Uncle, and everyone there knew it.They quickly came to find that it didn\u2019t matter where they went, they were likely to run into a very pure and fair young man, slender, with a certain proud look on his face that he tried to cover up, but was unable to. As he swaggered along, he would loudly clear his throat whenever he encountered another disciple, and if they pretended they didn\u2019t recognize him, he would immediately introduce himself.Their throats began to go hoarse from speaking the words \u2018Sect Uncle Bai\u2019, and yet\u2026 they had no choice but to continue doing so. After all, Bai Xiaochun was the Junior Brother of the sect leader, and in terms of seniority, he outranked everyone. Any disciple who dared to offend him was essentially violating sect rules.Eventually, people went to Big Fatty Zhang to ask for help. In turn, he made a huge fanfare about seeing Bai Xiaochun off\u2026 to visit Green Crest Peak.Another month passed, and the disciples of Green Crest Peak\u2026 were also driven crazy.That was especially true of Chen Fei and his two friends, who were soon frightened out of their minds. Once Bai Xiaochun began to do the rounds at Green Crest Peak, he would frequently look for them. Despite the fact that they would instantly begin to blabber greetings to \u2018Sect Uncle Bai\u2019, that didn\u2019t end things.Bai Xiaochun was quick to nitpick, and if they showed even an iota of disrespect, he would imply that he would report them to the Hall of Justice. Chen Fei and his friends began to shake with fear, and were soon treading on thin ice no matter where they went. In the end, they finally ratted out Qian Dajin. After giving them another good thrashing, Bai Xiaochun finally let them off the hook. Sighing, he left Green Crest Peak, all the while blaming himself for what was going on.\u201cThe Outer Sect disciples all know me, but I haven\u2019t had a chance to meet any of the Inner Sect disciples. And then there\u2019s Qian Dajin. Does he really think I\u2019ve forgotten about him?\u201d After a long moment of thought, Bai Xiaochun nodded deeply at the prospect of the immense pleasure he was about to experience. With that, he hurried off to find some Inner Sect disciples.In the following days, Bai Xiaochun made appearances on all three of the mountain peaks, most of the time in the areas occupied by the Inner Sect disciples. Considering his status, he could go almost anywhere in the Spirit Stream Sect.However, he quickly lost interest. The Inner Sect disciples all happened to be in secluded meditation, and he hardly saw a single one even after a few months passed. That was especially true of Qian Dajin, whose immortal\u2019s cave was constantly under the protection of several spell formations.\u201cI refuse to believe this just a coincidence!\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought as he stood there in front of Qian Dajin\u2019s door. He tried to break through the spell formations, but considering they were there to protect the immortal\u2019s cave of an Inner Sect disciple, they were simply too powerful. Seeing that it was impossible for him to succeed on his own, he decided that it would be best to go get some help in breaking them open.However, it was at this point that two people appeared off in the distance, racing in his direction. They were Inner Sect disciples, one tall, one short, and as they closed in, they didn\u2019t even make a show of clasping their hands in greeting.The first one to speak was the tall one. Voice cool, he said, \u201cSect Uncle Bai, how about you give my clan\u2019s Young Lord a bit of face and forget about what happened with Qian Dajin? Oh, by the way, that Young Lord is none other than Shangguan Tianyou.\u201dFrom the young man\u2019s tone of voice, he made it clear what he expected Bai Xiaochun to do.Shangguan Tianyou was the most respected among the three great Chosen of the three mountain peaks of the south bank!Latent talent such as his had been rare for at least a thousand years on the south bank of the Spirit Stream Sect, and although he was only an Outer Sect disciple, there was no question that he would soon reach Foundation Establishment. Because of that, many of the elders in the sect viewed Shangguan Tianyou as being a bit different from everyone else. Many people even hoped that he would eventually be able to outdo the disciples of the north bank, and as such, a lot of resources were being put into his training.That in turn caused Shangguan Tianyou to have a lot of fans, especially on Green Crest Peak.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression was the same as ever. In the past, he might have started to get scared. However, his general fear of death did not indicate that he lacked courage. In fact, as long as a situation didn\u2019t carry the threat of death, he was actually quite dauntless.Because of his current status, there was virtually nothing and no one in the sect who could threaten his life, and therefore, he simply turned his nose up and stared at the two newcomers with a slight smile.\u201cWhen you meet an important person like me, but fail to offer formal greetings, it shows what great gall the two of you have, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d He flicked his sleeve. \u201cWho might it be that egged you on into such impertinent disrespect? Might it have been Shangguan Tianyou?\u201dThe two Inner Sect disciples\u2019 expressions flickered, and the tall one\u2019s gaze turned sharp as he stared at Bai Xiaochun.\u201cSect Uncle Bai,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019d do best to pick your words a bit more carefully.\u201dAlmost as soon as the words left his mouth, and before he could continue speaking, Bai Xiaochun suddenly vanished. A blast of wind swept across the Inner Sect disciple, who stared in shock as Bai Xiaochun appeared directly in front of him.His speed was so incredible that the two Inner Sect disciples hadn\u2019t even seen him move. Before they could react, Bai Xiaochun stretched his palm back and swept it toward the tall disciple\u2019s face, causing a sound like thunder to rumble out.Almost instantly, a protective shield sprang up from within the young man\u2019s robe, the result of a magical device given to all Inner Sect disciples. However, in almost the same instant that the shield appeared, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s palm landed, and it shattered into a thousand pieces. It was completely incapable of standing up to the incredible power of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s palm.A massive slap rang out, and the tall disciple instantly saw stars. His mind thrummed, and he almost felt like he had been crushed by a mountain. Blood sprayed out of his mouth as he slammed into the ground, tumbling backward like a kite with its string cut. After rolling along for several dozen meters, shrieking the entire way, he finally lapsed into unconsciousness.Everything happened so quickly that the short disciple could do nothing more than stand there, mouth agape, mind spinning. After a moment, he began to edge backward, glancing first at his unconscious comrade and then back at Bai Xiaochun. Then he took a deep breath, and swallowed hard.\u201cY-you\u2026 you\u2026.\u201d he stammered, pointing shakily at Bai Xiaochun. Never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fleshly body power would be so shocking.It seemed on par with the eighth level of Qi Condensation\u2026.Bai Xiaochun turned slowly to look at the short disciple, and then said, \u201cCan an Inner Sect disciple really gesture so rudely to someone of the elder generation?\u201dThen he began to walk forward.Shrieking, the short disciple turned tail and fled. However, before he could get very far, the sound of a screaming wind filled the air as Bai Xiaochun bore down on him and once again unleashed a mighty slap.It was at that very moment that a stern, sinister voice rang out from down below.\u201cStay your hand!\u201d Suddenly, a newcomer appeared on the scene.However, Bai Xiaochun paid him no heed. His palm moved too quickly, and the short Inner Sect disciple was sent flying. Teeth spun through the air, and blood spattered. The disciple\u2019s neck seemed to be on the verge of breaking as he flew off to the side, unconscious.With that, Bai Xiaochun shook out his hand and looked at the person racing up from further down the mountain. It was a middle-aged man with a cultivation base in the ninth level of Qi Condensation, a level of power similar to Chen Heng.The man glared furiously at Bai Xiaochun and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear what I just said, Bai Xiaochun? Dammit! You\u2019re\u2013\u201dBai Xiaochun lifted his chin, smiled, and interrupted, \u201cSect Nephew, are you looking to get slapped as well?\u201dFrom the actions of the two disciples moments ago, as well as this man\u2019s words, it was clear that they didn\u2019t have the least bit of respect for him, and furthermore, even disdained him to some degree, as though they felt that they completely outranked him. Inner Sect disciples like that were completely contemptible as far as he was concerned.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words caused various expressions to flash across the man\u2019s face, and he bit back his next words. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s impressive display of fleshly body strength left him breathless and in complete shock. Now that the man thought about it, he realized that, considering Bai Xiaochun\u2019s status, it didn\u2019t matter what he did here, the Hall of Justice wouldn\u2019t care a bit.The middle-aged man stared at Bai Xiaochun for a long moment, suppressed his fury, and then explained his purpose in coming. \u201cBai Xiaochun, my clan\u2019s Young Lord wishes for you to go offer him formal greetings.\u201dHe had actually been sent by Shangguan Tianyou to order Bai Xiaochun go offer formal greetings.In his opinion, his clan\u2019s Young Lord was making a mountain out of a molehill. Bai Xiaochun had lucked his way into being an important person, and was more of a clown than anything else. He had killed a few weak members of some cultivator clan, and it was only by chance that the sect ended up making a big deal about him. That certainly didn\u2019t earn him the right to be given face by a Young Lord who was already making his meteoric rise, and would certainly reach the Gold Core stage and forge a legend in the future.In fact, this man actually felt that being sent to fetch Bai Xiaochun to come offer greetings was a bit below his status.Bai Xiaochun could already see how arrogant of a person Shangguan Tianyou was. Considering his own status, if he didn\u2019t come in person, or if he chose to just send a message, it might be acceptable. But instead, he actually wanted Bai Xiaochun to go visit him! \u201cEven if he\u2019s a Chosen, do you really think an Outer Sect disciple can order me to offer him greetings? He should be the one coming to greet me!\u201dThe middle-aged man flicked his sleeve, sending out a blast of wind. \u201cBai Xiaochun,\u201d he grated furiously, \u201cfor my clan\u2019s Young Lord to ask you to go visit him is a huge show of face. Do you know how many people wish they could go offer formal greetings? You\u2013\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, his face flickered, and he leaped backward. However, he was just a bit too slow. Bai Xiaochun appeared directly in front of him and reached back his palm.\u201cHow dare you!!\u201d The man\u2019s cultivation base was in the ninth level of Qi Condensation, and he unleashed all of its power, simultaneously performing an incantation gesture that summoned numerous wind blades. However, even as the wind blades appeared in front of him, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s palm smashed into them, crushing them like twigs. They couldn\u2019t provide even the slightest bit of protection.The palm proceeded onward almost as if nothing had attempted to block its way, landing almost instantly on the man\u2019s face.A slapping sound echoed out, followed by a scream. The middle-aged man staggered backward thirty meters or more before finally lurching to a stop.With that, Bai Xiaochun swished his sleeve and snorted arrogantly. \u201cYou\u2019re not even as powerful as Chen Heng. No wonder you\u2019re such a lackey! Screw off!\u201dThe man looked back at Bai Xiaochun in astonishment. He was shaking visibly, and his cheek was already swelling up. Blood oozing from between his teeth, he quickly fled.After the man left, Bai Xiaochun looked back toward Qian Dajin\u2019s immortal\u2019s cave with narrowed eyes. He was the type of person who feared death, and as such, if someone tried to kill him, he would seek revenge upon them no matter what.It didn\u2019t matter if Qian Dajin asked for help from Shangguan Tianyou, there was no possible way Bai Xiaochun would let him off the hook. Although Bai Xiaochun\u2019s actions in the sect recently had seemed somewhat casual, he had actually long since carried out a thorough investigation about Qian Dajin.\u201cYou think you can hide away in there?\u201d he thought. \u201cYou think I have no way of making you show your face?\u201d With a cold snort, he turned to leave.Based on his current status, what happened next was no surprise. A jade slip from the Hall of Justice appeared, a mission. It took only a moment for it to pass into Qian Dajin\u2019s immortal\u2019s cave, and hover in the air in front of him.It was just like what had happened with Bai Xiaochun. Qian Dajin was being forced to accept a very dangerous mission outside the sect. A bitter smile appeared on his face, as he realized that he had no choice but to emerge from hiding to carry out the mission\u2026. However, he still clung to the hope that being outside of the sect might help him avoid catastrophe.Unfortunately, he had underestimated the lengths to which Bai Xiaochun would go to exact his revenge. He had already arranged for several such missions to be assigned to Qian Dajin. Furthermore, he\u2019d asked for some help from Hou Yunfei. The Hou Clan had a Foundation Establishment patriarch, and access to other deep reserves. Considering how important Bai Xiaochun was to them, and coupled with the urgings of Hou Yunfei and Hou Xiaomei, they had become a powerful ally.With the help of the Hou Clan, it was a foreordained certainty that Qian Dajin would be struck with misfortune during the course of trying to carry out the missions.It wasn\u2019t that the Hall of Justice was unaware of what had occurred with Qian Dajin, and how it led to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fall in combat. However, despite the fact that the news was never spread publically, internal records had been maintained.Now that Bai Xiaochun was back and wanted to settle accounts, there was little they could do to stop him. In fact, it was almost as if they owed him, and were simply allowing him to do what he wanted. To top it off, there were even some people who had already come to view Qian Dajin as dead.\u2014Translator: Deathblade. Chinese language consultant: ASI a.k.a. Beerblade. Editor: GNE. Memes: Logan.

    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 70: Hey, Elder Brother LiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 70: Hey, Elder Brother LiIn a certain location near the summit of Green Crest Peak was a solitary little path. At the end of that path was a pool of water, within which swam several golden-colored fish.Next to the pond was an immortal\u2019s cave. It was a somewhat remote and isolated place, very quiet, with abundant spiritual energy that clearly exceeded anything else nearby.On the bank of the pond sat a young man. He wore the long robe of an Outer Sect disciple, and was exceedingly good-looking, with long black hair, fair skin, and a refined, intelligent air.He was the type of young man that female disciples would sigh over constantly, whose phoenix-like eyes were delicate, and yet glistened with flickering light. Overall, he seemed completely unique.He currently held a fishing rod, which he would occasionally cast out into the pond, whereupon the fish would voraciously compete to gobble up the food attached to the end of the line.The middle-aged man who Bai Xiaochun had just slapped was hurrying up the path, face ashen. When he reached the end, he slowed down and respectfully clasped hands and bowed to the young man.\u201cGreetings, Young Lord,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cYoung Lord, Bai Xiaochun doesn\u2019t know how to appreciate favors. I carefully relayed your message, but instead of coming to offer greetings, he acted bossy and domineering. He thinks he can simply throw his weight around with impunity!\u201dThe young man looked over, his expression seemingly ambivalent. \u201cWell,\u201d he said coolly, \u201cforget about it then. He\u2019s a nobody. It was mostly just on a whim that I thought to have him come offer greetings.\u201dThe man nodded. \u201cI think I understand what you mean, Young Lord. The reason he\u2019s a nobody is that the position of Prestige disciple is only given to dead people, right? Plus, being the Junior Brother of the Sect Leader is a complete joke. In fact, his Master is actually a corpse.\u201d The man chuckled coldly for a moment, but then shivered as he realized that the young man was staring at him with an icy expression. All of a sudden, the middle-aged man was struck with fear. \u201cYoung\u2026 Young Lord\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that he\u2019s a nobody,\u201d the young man said, \u201cnot even worth paying attention to. However, the Sect Leader\u2019s Master is a former patriarch of our sect. Do you really think you qualify to even mention him? Go to the Frigid Abyss and slap yourself for three months straight as punishment.\u201d With that, the young man looked away and continued to feed his golden fish.Trembling, the middle-aged man nodded in assent and quickly took his leave.**Having settled the issue of Qian Dajin, Bai Xiaochun returned to Fragrant Cloud Peak. He wasn\u2019t worried at all about Shangguan Tianyou. Considering the meritorious service he had performed for the sect, unless he turned traitor, his life wouldn\u2019t be in danger at all.As time passed, he lost some of his excitement over being called Sect Uncle, especially considering that most people avoided him at all costs. In fact, he actually came to feel a bit melancholy. However, one day he happened to wander into the scripture pavilion, whereupon his spirits were lifted almost instantly.He found that as soon as he arrived, he was immediately granted a reading space alongside the lecturing elders, where he could look down upon the countless disciples in attendance.He fell in love with the experience almost immediately, after which he came to frequent the mountaintop sermon pavilion.There he would sit, occasionally giving a smile and a nod to disciples down below, eyes sparkling with satisfaction. He looked very much like the Foundation Establishment elders whom he sat next to.The Foundation Establishment elders didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, and as for the disciples from the various mountain peaks, their spirits couldn\u2019t be lower, but they had no choice but to simply stare up angrily at Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun had found a new way to flaunt his status as the Junior Brother of the sect leader.When he came into the presence of the Foundation Establishment cultivators, he would immediately call them Elder Brother and Elder Sister. Although they didn\u2019t say anything in response, strange expressions could be seen on their faces, and any nearby disciples would eventually be forced to utter the words \u2018Sect Uncle Bai\u2019.Things went on like that for some time until one day, Bai Xiaochun happened to run into Li Qinghou. Unable to restrain himself, Bai Xiaochun immediately cried out in an amiable tone, \u201cHey, Elder Brother Li.\u201dLi Qinghou looked a bit haggard. He had been working this entire time on concocting the Nine Ultimates Pill, and was currently on his way out of the sect. As soon as the words entered his ears, his jaw dropped, and he looked around until his gaze came to fall on Bai Xiaochun. Then, his cheek twitched. Although he had been spending all his time on pill-concocting lately, he had heard about Bai Xiaochun\u2019s antics, which had turned into quite a headache. To hear Bai Xiaochun addressing him in such a fashion left Li Qinghou glaring in shock.As soon as the words left his mouth, Bai Xiaochun regretted speaking them. Seeing Li Qinghou\u2019s reaction then caused him to suck in a breath. After all, Li Qinghou was the person he feared most in the entire sect.Grimacing, he shivered and quickly said, \u201cUncle Li\u2026 er\u2026 my mistake.\u201dHowever, there was really nothing Li Qinghou could do, and he knew it. Glaring even harder at Bai Xiaochun, he decided to rebuke him a bit for his recent behavior.\u201cI\u2019m leaving the sect for a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the soonest, I\u2019ll be back in a few months; at the most, a year. Don\u2019t even think of fooling around while I\u2019m gone. Work hard at your cultivation.\u201d After a few more words of exhortation, he turned and left.Bai Xiaochun let out a long sigh of relief as Li Qinghou made his way off into the distance. A glimmer of fear could be seen in his eyes, but at the same time, a bit of warmth and respect for one of his elders could also be seen. He couldn\u2019t help but remember what Du Lingfei said about the time he had gone missing, and how Li Qinghou had spent two months searching for him on his own. Upon his return, Li Qinghou had been in quite a sorry state, and seemed to blame himself for what had happened.After Bai Xiaochun\u2019s father and mother fell sick and died, he hadn\u2019t shown such warmth and respect to anyone. At some point, though, he had come to view Li Qinghou as one of his own relatives.Because of Li Qinghou\u2019s admonition, Bai Xiaochun changed his ways for about half a month. During that time, he ceased clearing his throat to attract attention, and instead focused his attention on Zhou Xinqi\u2019s immortal\u2019s cave. In all of the sect, she was the only person who knew him personally but refused to call him Sect Uncle Bai.After a few months passed, he started to get a bit depressed. After all, he could only catch sight of Zhou Xinqi whizzing around on her blue flying silk. Considering that he was incapable of flight, it didn\u2019t matter how much he chased after her, he could only watch in dismay as she flew away.\u201cThere are probably only a few magical devices in the whole sect that Qi Condensation disciples can use to fly. Without a special technique like the one that Chen Heng used, the only way to fly is to get one of those magical devices.\u201cIt\u2019s so unfair! My Master should have gifted me with such an item. My\u2026 my Master\u2026.\u201d Sighing, he walked along for a bit more before suddenly stopping in his tracks. Looking up in thought for a moment, he suddenly turned and headed toward Mount Daoseed.As the Junior Brother of the Sect Leader, he had unrestricted access to Mount Daoseed, and before long, there he was at the top of the mountain, where Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong\u2019s grand hall was located.Swaggering in, Bai Xiaochun called out, \u201cElder Brother Sect Leader, oh dear Elder Brother Sect Leader!! I want to go offer incense to my Master!\u201dZheng Yuandong sat there in the hall cross-legged in meditation. As soon as he heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s voice, he sighed.In recent days, so many people had come to visit him that he had lost count. He had heard all about Bai Xiaochun\u2019s doings, and had long since come to regret the situation. Unfortunately, as the old saying went, the timber had already been crafted into a boat, and there was little to be done. After all, despite Bai Xiaochun\u2019s peculiar preoccupations, he wasn\u2019t doing anything to hurt anyone.Hearing Bai Xiaochun continue to call out to him, Zheng Yuandong slowly rose to his feet, cleared his throat, and looked over solemnly.\u201cCalm down, I heard you.\u201dLooking very charming, Bai Xiaochun hurried over and clasped hands in greeting. \u201cJunior Brother offers greetings, Elder Brother Sect Leader.\u201dZheng Yuandong sighed inwardly. Although he knew what was going on, he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head and smile wryly as he led Bai Xiaochun into the restricted area behind the mountain.In the immortal\u2019s cave in that area, a portrait was hung on the wall depicting a middle-aged man. The man smiled faintly as he looked off into the distance, emanating a unique aura that made his image look quite lifelike.Beneath the portrait was a small tribute altar, upon which could be seen some spirit fruits and spirit candles. The immortal\u2019s cave was simple but elegant, and filled one with a sense of incredible dignity.As soon as Bai Xiaochun entered, he hurried over to the portrait and plopped down into a kneeling position. Then he began to kowtow deeply, touching the floor with his forehead nine times, his expression very solemn.Finally, he looked up at the portrait, his eyes radiating pious sincerity. \u201cMaster, apprentice has come to pay respects.\u201dZheng Yuandong stood off to the side looking on. Although he new Bai Xiaochun was stubborn and mischievous, he also could tell that he had a filial heart. Considering Zheng Yuandong\u2019s experience in life, he was able to tell from Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression that the pious sincerity was real, and not an act.But then\u2026 Bai Xiaochun continued to speak.\u201cMaster, your apprentice has been going through some tough times. I can\u2019t even fly\u2026. Other disciples\u2019 Masters have all given them magical items to help them fly, as well as life-protecting treasures. Sadly, I don\u2019t have anything\u2026.\u201cBut that\u2019s fine, Master. Your apprentice doesn\u2019t care about material things anyway. As long as I can burn some incense for you, sir, then I\u2019m happy. Who knows, maybe your spirit in heaven will hear me and somehow manage to bequeath me with something\u2026.\u201dWhen Zheng Yuandong heard this, his eyes went wide.\u201cMaster, it wasn\u2019t very long ago that your apprentice gave everything to protect the sect, to ensure that its 10,000-year legacy continued on. To protect the honor of the sect, I was chased down relentlessly, and during that time, all of my magical items were lost or ruined. I came back to the sect without anything to call my own. My bags are empty. I\u2019m more impoverished than a servant\u2026.\u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel any pressure, though, Master. It\u2019s fine. Your apprentice isn\u2019t afraid of lacking defensive magical items. Even if I don\u2019t have a magical flight device, I\u2019ll still go through hell or high water for the sect. It\u2019s my duty! However, if enough time goes by and I haven\u2019t come to burn incense for you, Master, then that will just go to show that my lack of life-protecting magical items and magical flight devices has caused me to lose my poor little life\u2026. At least then I will be able to personally go to reunite with you, sir.\u201d Even as he spoke, Bai Xiaochun looked out at his dear Elder Brother Sect Leader out of the corner of his eye.Zheng Yuandong\u2019s face twitched. He was truly stupefied. In all the years he had practiced cultivation, this was the first time he had ever encountered a disciple as outlandish as Bai Xiaochun.Chuckling bitterly in his heart, he looked up at the portrait of his Master, and then thought for a long moment. It was true that when he had first been apprenticed to his Master, he had been bequeathed with a protective magical device.Having reached this point in his train of thought, Zheng Yuandong looked over at Bai Xiaochun, his gaze softening.Before long, Bai Xiaochun and Zheng Yuandong left the immortal\u2019s cave. The entire time, Bai Xiaochun was looking at Zheng Yuandong out of the corner of his eye. Eventually, they reached the grand hall on Mount Daoseed, whereupon Zheng Yuandong stopped walking. Turning to look at Bai Xiaochun, he waved his hand, causing two streams of light to fly out, one of them gold, the other white.The golden light contained a palm-sized flying sword. However, its mere appearance caused the air around it to distort as it radiated waves of heat. It seemed completely extraordinary, and was covered with countless complicated magical symbols which glittered radiantly, and caused fluctuations to spill out in all directions.The white light contained a small shield, also palm-sized. It was made of white jade, and carved with extremely life-like immortal cranes. It also radiated an intense warmth.Bai Xiaochun could instantly tell that they were extraordinary items. Eyes shining, he began to pant as he realized that there was something even more outstanding to the two items; both of them were decorated with three unique flowing sets of lines.Zheng Yuandong looked gently at Bai Xiaochun, his eyes gleaming with encouragement.\u201cWithin the Golden Crow Sword is sealed a golden crow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt contains the power of blazing fire, and can summon an illusory golden crow of the same cultivation base as the person summoning it. It can be used to fly, and can be used until the early Foundation Establishment stage. If it is destroyed, it will unleash incredible power.\u201cThe Divine Crane Shield is a defensive magical device created from the soul of an immortal crane. It can protect you from any deadly crisis less powerful than Foundation Establishment.\u201cMy Master performed threefold spirit enhancements on both of these items, but didn\u2019t dare to proceed beyond that. Back when I joined the sect, my Master gave them to me, and I hereby represent him to bequeath them to you.\u201dBai Xiaochun excitedly accepted the items and began to fondle them admiringly. \u201cThank you, Master. Thank you, dear Elder Brother Sect Leader!\u201d\u2014Translator: Deathblade. Chinese language consultant: ASI a.k.a. Beerblade. Editor: GNE. Memes: Logan.

    "Chapter 73": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 71: Living Prestige ScionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71: Living Prestige ScionBecause of the turtle-wok, Bai Xiaochun understood quite a bit about spirit enhancement. He also was well aware that there was a Foundation Establishment elder from Violet Cauldron Peak who was a skilled spirit enhancer.For a few merit points, that elder would help disciples perform spirit enhancements, usually no more than a one or twofold enhancement. Any higher than that, and the chances of failure mounted.The fact that these two magical items had both received threefold enhancements meant that Bai Xiaochun wouldn\u2019t have to waste any fuel on his own three-colored flame, and would also be able to freely use them in the public eye.After returning to Fragrant Cloud Peak, he immediately set to work familiarizing himself with the Golden Crow Sword and the Divine Crane Shield. As soon as he sent some spiritual power into them, they began to radiate intense heat.\u201cNow these are some treasures!\u201d he exclaimed. Taking a deep breath, he performed an incantation gesture and pointed out. A thrumming sound filled the air as the Golden Crow Sword transformed into a golden beam of light that shot off, leaving behind a wake of burning heat that caused everything around it to ripple and distort.With another incantation gesture, he sent more spiritual power pouring into the sword, whereupon the bright glow surrounding it expanded until the vague shape of a golden crow became visible.It was little more than an outline, but the instant it appeared, incredible pressure began to weigh down, and the temperature in the area increased rapidly. All of that caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart to thump excitedly.Panting, he stared at the Golden Crow Sword, eyes shining more and more brightly. Soon, he began to laugh in excitement.\u201cThis sword is way better than my little wooden sword! Wow, my Master is awesome!\u201d With that, he dashed into motion, leaping up into the air and landing onto the back of the illusory golden crow.Although the golden crow was blurry and vague, its back was as flat and sturdy as a board, and when Bai Xiaochun sent some spiritual power into it, he felt almost as if he had become a part of it.After stepping onto the golden crow, he performed an incantation gesture and pointed out, which caused him to fly up into the air. Then he soared in a big circle around Fragrant Cloud Peak, whizzing through the air above the crowds. When people looked up in surprise, he would slow down, hold his head high, and puff his chest out. When cries of astonishment began to ring out, he would finally increase his speed again.\u201cI, Bai Xiaochun, can finally fly!\u201d Spirits soaring, he laughed inwardly as his tour took him over the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion. However, it was only moments later, just as he was about to head toward one of the other mountain peaks, that the golden crow suddenly faded away, and the sword fell out of the sky. Bai Xiaochun screamed as he tumbled down along with it.Thankfully, what lay below wasn\u2019t a bottomless pit, but rather, one of the small paths that ran through the sect. He landed at a run, and only managed to gain control after several steps. Then he looked over and realized how high up this path was, and that if he had fallen off, even his Undying Skin wouldn\u2019t have saved him\u2026.His face went pale.\u201cThat was way too dangerous!!\u201d he thought, shivering. With that, he picked up the Golden Crow Sword. Probing his inner spiritual power, he realized that he had been almost completely drained, which was why he had ended up falling.For a Qi Condensation cultivator, flying on a sword took a huge amount of energy. Most who were in the seventh level of Qi Condensation would only be able to last for a few breaths of time before they had to stop. Even Bai Xiaochun, with his unusually refined spiritual power, couldn\u2019t even last a hundred breaths.Fearful of falling to his death, he didn\u2019t dare to test the sword out anymore. Looking around furtively for a moment to see if anyone had seen what just occurred, he caught sight of a burly man off in the distance, who was staring at him, his jaw hanging open.When Bai Xiaochun saw him, his eyes widened and he hurried over. \u201cWhoah, aren\u2019t you Sect Nephew Wolf?\u201dWhen the burly man heard the words \u2018Sect Nephew Wolf\u2019, he immediately shivered. Grimacing, he clasped hands and said, \u201cI\u2019m disciple Liu Ergou. Greetings, Sect Uncle Bai\u2026 I, um, I didn\u2019t see anything happen just now.\u201dBai Xiaochun had encountered Liu Ergou when he was selling spots in the Inner Sect. Back then, the man had called himself Lord Wolf.Bai Xiaochun humphed a few times, then proceeded to frighten Liu Ergou a bit more to ensure that he wouldn\u2019t spread news of what had happened. Then he patted him on the shoulder, gave some promises to help him out in the future, and finally left.Liu Ergo wiped the sweat from his brow before hurrying off.As he walked along, Bai Xiaochun rejoiced that it was only Liu Ergou who had seen his slight mishap. If it had happened when he was flying around by the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion, his name would have been ruined forever\u2026.\u201cAi. People. You really can\u2019t become too famous. Then things just become difficult.\u201d Sighing to himself, he clasped his hands behind his back and strolled back to his courtyard residence.After a bit of hesitation about what to do, his eyes flickered with determination. \u201cNo, I have to focus on cultivation. Only being able to fly a little bit isn\u2019t inherently bad, but what would happen if I was fleeing for my life? What if I escaped my enemies only to fall to my death? That would be really pointless.\u201dWith that, he once again began to study the Golden Crow Sword and the Divine Crane Shield.\u201cJust to be safe, I should paint these two magical items as well. That way, people will think it\u2019s just a hobby of mine. Then if I pull out other spirit enhanced magical items in the future, they won\u2019t think too much of it.\u201d After some more thought, he prepared some dye from brightly colored plants and proceeded to paint the Golden Crow Sword and the Divine Crane Shield.After covering up the faint spirit designs, he tested out the two items one more time. Finally, he looked pleased.\u201cOne of these days when my skill in the Dao of medicine is high enough, I\u2019ll enhance some plant-based dyeing materials, and then I can be completely confident.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was an inherently cautious person. Although he had run amuck to some extent because of becoming the Junior Brother of the sect leader, he had a bottom line that he wouldn\u2019t cross.\u201cWhat a pity my cultivation base still isn\u2019t high enough. The last time I was following Zhou Xinqi around, it seemed that she was already in the eighth level of Qi Condensation. The only way to be able to use a flying sword for any length of time is to have a higher cultivation base.\u201d Determination filled his heart. After the incident with the Luochen Clan, he had come to fully understand how brutal the cultivation world could be. He had also realized that the ability to flee at top speed was crucial when one\u2019s life was on the line.If he had been able to fly on a sword back then, he would have been able to escape with Du Lingfei and Hou Yunfei no matter what the Luochen Clan tried to do.\u201cI need to concoct pills!\u201d he thought, eyes gleaming. Considering his current status, although he couldn\u2019t get free ingredients from the sect, there were certain pill formulas that he could get for only a few merit points. In the following days, Fragrant Cloud Peak became a quiet place, and Bai Xiaochun was rarely seen.He acquired large amounts of medicine formulas, and also used the spirit stones and other items he had acquired from the Luochen Clan members to go to the market and purchase a variety of medicinal plants. Then he made his way to the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, where he went into seclusion to concoct medicine.Time flew by. A few months later, it had been nearly half a year since Bai Xiaochun returned to the sect. At first, the sect had been thrown into an uproar because of him, but then things had suddenly gone very quiet. Many people found it hard to adapt.At the same time, the fact that Bai Xiaochun had become a Prestige disciple gradually spread outside of the sect. Soon, people all over the Eastwood Continent came to hear of the matter.Of course, there were countless cultivator clans in the Eastwood Continent, many of which were connected to the Spirit Stream Sect in various ways. The Luochen Clan had been only one among many such clans.To the disciples of the Spirit Stream Sect, although the title of Prestige disciple was to be looked up to, being the Junior Brother of the sect leader was even more impressive.However, to the cultivator clans at large, it was exactly the opposite. They would respect a Prestige disciple far more than they would the Junior Brother of the sect leader. In fact, they almost didn\u2019t care at all about the sect leader\u2019s Junior Brother. In contrast, they would be driven to near madness by a Prestige disciple.After hearing the news that Bai Xiaochun had become a Prestige disciple, many patriarchs of the various cultivator clans got very excited. In their eyes, he was a virtual gold mine. A living Prestige scion!If they could bring Bai Xiaochun into their clan, then his descendants would have almost limitless possibilities for the future. As the number of such descendants grew, and considering that the clan would have the support of the Spirit Stream Sect, glory was guaranteed.To vassal clans in the cultivation world, it would ensure a meteoric rise, like the fish who jumped the dragon gate.After all, the Spirit Stream Sect had only ever had nine Prestige clans. Those nine clans could often influence the decision-making process of the sect as a whole. Although such influence wasn\u2019t necessarily very vast, it was still worthy of consideration.Such a clan would form a part of an enormously powerful entity, and would be the subject of intense envy from other cultivator clans. In the past, most clans couldn\u2019t influence anything. They could only offer allegiance to the Spirit Stream Sect and then perform various services with the hope of gaining Prestige status.But now\u2026 Bai Xiaochun had appeared.Most wonderful of all was that he wasn\u2019t a member of any cultivator clan. He came from the mortal world, and\u2026 he had no Daoist partner. He was a free ticket to becoming the tenth Prestige clan, and as such, all of the cultivator clans in the Eastwood Continent were thrown into a frenzy.\u201cFind the prettiest maiden in the entire Zhou Clan. She\u2019ll be coming with me to offer greetings to Fellow Daoist Bai!\u201d\u201cFei\u2019er, you\u2019re the pearl of the Zhao Clan. You have to get on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s good side. If he takes a liking to you, all of the problems of our clan will disappear!\u201d\u201cAlthough the daughters of the Sun Clan aren\u2019t particularly outstanding, we still qualify to compete. Prepare an amazing gift for me to give when I go offer greetings to Fellow Daoist Bai!\u201dCountless cultivator clans sprang into action, using all sorts of methods, including calling upon their clan members who were already within the sect to try to get in touch with Bai Xiaochun. Even the north bank was affected. Soon, the name of Bai Xiaochun could be heard in all parts of the Eastwood Continent.The Hou Clan was no exception.The middle-aged patriarch of the Hou Clan summoned Hou Yunfei and Hou Xiaomei, whereupon he expressed his sincere wishes: \u201cYunfei, you have an unusually close relationship with Bai Xiaochun. You\u2026 have to help out the clan in this matter. I can tell that your sister has taken a liking to Bai Xiaochun. Find a good chance to act as a matchmaker between them.\u201dHou Xiaomei\u2019s face reddened. Pouting coquettishly, she hurried off.Hou Yunfei was a bit worried, but he put on a bold face and nodded in agreement.A few days later, people from numerous cultivator clans began to show up, gathering on Fragrant Cloud Peak around Bai Xiaochun\u2019s residence. As news spread, some people even began to head toward the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, waiting anxiously for him to come out of seclusion.\u2014Translator: Deathblade.

    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 72: The Sect Has RulesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72: The Sect Has RulesA few days later, a boom echoed out from Bai Xiaochun\u2019s pill-concocting workstation. Moments later, he appeared, frowning and looking anxious.\u201cAlthough I\u2019m pretty familiar with tier-1 medicinal pills now,\u201d he lamented, \u201c tier-2 pills are a lot harder\u2026.\u201d Other than cultivation, his time recently had mostly been spent on concocting medicines. In his attempt to produce some tier-2 spirit medicines, he\u2019d already used up most of the plants and vegetation in his bag. Unfortunately, the degree of difficulty he was working with was vastly greater than before, and despite being meticulously careful, he had failed consistently.Each time he found that he had used too many materials, he would make adjustments. And yet even then, new problems would arise.Sighing in despair, he walked out of the Medicine Concocting Pavilion and looked up to find a large host of people sitting there cross-legged. Most of them sat in groups of three to five, with a few groups of ten in sight. The majority were pretty young women, none of whom were familiar to Bai Xiaochun.They were all different shapes and sizes, but each one was beautiful in her own way. The lot of them were clearly vying with each other to be the most glamorous, and as soon as they saw Bai Xiaochun emerge, their eyes shone brightly.Most had older folks sitting next to them, who also seemed delighted to see Bai Xiaochun. In fact, they all rose to their feet and rushed over in a hubbub.Taken aback, and a bit unsure of what was going on, Bai Xiaochun subconsciously stepped back a few paces. \u201cHey, hold on! What\u2026 what are you people doing?\u201d\u201cFellow Daoist Bai, I\u2019m Zhao Tianhai. Zhao Yiduo is my nephew! Hahaha! Fellow Daoist Bai, you truly are a young hero, a man of striking appearance and talent!\u201d\u201cFellow Daoist Bai! What a dragon among men, heroic and extraordinary! A single glance reveals that he\u2019s like a roc soaring among the clouds, someone with unlimited potential. Ahem. I am Sun Yunshan, and these young women are all beauties from my clan. Fellow Daoist, if I\u2019m not mistaken, you\u2019re lacking in terms of maidservants, correct?\u201d\u201cFellow Daoist Bai, I am Zhou Tian. A single glance at you, Fellow Daoist Bai, and I can clearly sense your heroic spirit. You are obviously the future overlord of the eastern reaches of the cultivation world. We were destined to be friends at first sight. Look at these young women standing next to me. Every single one is a precious pearl of the Zhou Clan\u2026.\u201dA clamor of voices rang out, each one trying to speak first and loudest. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes went wide, and he retreated a few more steps. However, it only took a moment for him to realize that these people had come to offer their clan daughters to him\u2026.He wasn\u2019t sure exactly why it was happening, but upon looking the young women over, he could see that all of them were exceptionally beautiful. In fact, many of them could be counted as being his type. The way they were being offered up seemed to indicate that if he didn\u2019t accept, he would be refusing to give them face. Instantly, Bai Xiaochun was on guard.Of course, he was adept at dealing with people, so he didn\u2019t let any hint of that show on his face. A broad smile appeared, and after exchanging some meaningless pleasantries with the spokesmen from the various cultivator clans, he managed to extricate himself.However, before he could reach his residence, he ran into others who had stationed themselves along the way. All of them had similar words to speak with him, and offered him their clan daughters as well as other gifts and promises.\u201cSomething big must have happened, but what?\u201d he thought. \u201cCould it be that they found out one of my ancestors was an immortal? Maybe I\u2019m not from the mortal world after all. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m actually descended from some exalted, powerful individual? Heavens! How could I not have been aware?!\u201d Mind spinning, he hurried along until his residence came in view. However, it was surrounded by a crowd of individuals from various cultivator clans, all of whose eyes glistened with hope. It was as if the mere nod of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s head would cause them to do anything he wished!That was especially true of the young women. They all clustered around Bai Xiaochun, glaring antagonistically at each other, pushing and shoving each other back and forth.The sight of it all caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s scalp to go numb. He was completely surrounded, and no matter which way he tried to move, he ran into something soft and warm. They even began to tug at his clothing, causing his heart to pound. Finally, a cold snort rang out, and Hou Xiaomei appeared. Glaring angrily, cheeks puffed, she stormed up to him, shoving the other young women aside.\u201cGet out of my way! What do you people think you\u2019re doing!? This is Fragrant Cloud Peak of the Spirit Stream Sect. Don\u2019t you bunch of old coots know how to keep your cool? Get out of my way, all of you. Hey you! Look at you! You\u2019re skinnier than a greenbean! What are you shoving people around for? And you! You\u2019re fatter than a dairy cow! Get the hell out of my way!!\u201d Hou Xiaomei sounded genuinely furious as she pushed aside all of the young women crowding around Bai Xiaochun.She was small and delicate, but she was fuming, and seemed to be filled with boundless strength. Facing such opposition, the other young women immediately surrendered and opened a path, crying out in confusion. Hou Xiaomei stormed forward with her hands on her hips, looking like a chili pepper, the words she uttered incisive and damaging.Bai Xiaochun took advantage of the moment to hurry into the courtyard. Once inside, he looked down to find that his garments had been tugged at so much that they were about to fall off.\u201cAbsolutely terrifying!\u201d he thought, gasping. Heart pounding with residual fear, he looked back out through the main gate and saw Hou Xiaomei standing there verbally sparring with the other young women, standing alone against a crowd of dozens.Eventually, the responsible members of the cultivator clans couldn\u2019t stand idly by. They finally intervened and suggested to the young women that they leave. Clasping hands respectfully in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction, they promised to come back to visit at a later date.Soon, it was evening. It was quiet outside of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s gate, but off in the distance, people from various cultivator clans were sitting cross-legged in meditation, seemingly guarding the area.All of these people had used various means and methods to come from afar, and also had ways to keep themselves from being driven away.Bai Xiaochun was sure that something momentous had occurred. Looking at the quiet scene outside, he eventually dragged Hou Xiaomei into the courtyard.To outsiders, Hou Xiaomei was as fiery as a hot pepper, but as soon as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand made contact with her, her face turned bright red, and she felt dizzy. Her tiny frame almost went limp as Bai Xiaochun dragged her inside.When she spoke, her voice was as soft as the drone of a mosquito. \u201cBig\u2026 big bro Xiaochun, there are so many people around, what are you planning to do to me\u2026?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, staring in shock. Seeing Hou Xiaomei\u2019s odd countenance, he could tell that something was wrong with her, and quickly slapped her cheek. When she didn\u2019t seem to recover, he slapped her again. Hou Xiaomei immediately regained her senses.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you!?\u201d she snapped, stamping her foot. However, realizing she had been the one in the wrong, she tossed a jade slip to him, and then turned heel and fled.As he watched Hou Xiaomei flee into the distance, Bai Xiaochun stood there wondering what was going on. Finally, he looked down at the jade slip and scanned it with spiritual power. As he did, his eyes went wide. After scanning it again, he stood there in the courtyard, breathing heavily.\u201cPrestige clan\u2026.\u201dThe jade slip had been sent to Bai Xiaochun by Hou Yunfei, with Hou Xiaomei being the messenger. The words contained within were the type that almost couldn\u2019t be uttered aloud. They explained why all of the cultivator clans were so interested in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s status as a Prestige disciple, and what had occurred as a result. They also explained that the Hou Clan held an intense hope that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s descendants\u2026 would also have the blood of the Hou Clan running in their veins.Then Bai Xiaochun thought about how Hou Xiaomei had been acting just now, and he rubbed his chin thoughtfully. Eyes sparkling, he thought, not about Hou Xiaomei, but about his own words from moments ago. Something momentous had occurred!\u201cHow could I have imagined\u2026? And here I thought the reward for my meritorious service was basically useless. I thought that being the Junior Brother of the sect leader would make me a big hero in the sect, but I never thought that being a Prestige disciple would make me so important on the outside!\u201d He licked his lips, and soon, his heart began to beat faster.\u201cI could pick any Daoist partner I wanted! All of their clan resources would be at my disposal\u2026. Finally, I have some real hope to live forever!\u201d Chuckling mischievously, his eyes began to shine. Previously, he had been worried about how to keep up his efforts to concoct tier-2 spirit medicine. But now, people were essentially fighting over the chance to give him gifts.\u201cWhat a pity I can\u2019t accept them all\u2026.\u201d he murmured. But then, he was struck with inspiration.\u201cWait a second! Why can\u2019t I accept them all?!\u201d Clearing his throat, he entered his cabin to rest for the evening, thinking the whole time about what to do next. The following morning at dawn, he leapt out of bed, trembling with excitement. After pushing open the gate of the courtyard, he found a whole host of people from various cultivator clans waiting for him.\u201cFellow Daoist Bai\u2026.\u201d\u201cGreetings, Fellow Daoist Bai. Your humble servant has come upon the request of our clan patriarch to offer formal greetings\u2026.\u201dEveryone started talking at once, filling the air with a cacophony of sound. Bai Xiaochun stuck out his chin and flicked his sleeve.\u201cAlright, enough is enough,\u201d he said, smiling so widely that his eyes became slits. \u201cEveryone come close. Whatever requests you have, we can talk them all out.\u201d With that, he randomly nodded in the direction of one of the clans. The responsible member of the clan rushed forward in delight, dragging a few young women with him.The women approached, looking a bit nervous. As for all of the other observing clans, they also seemed nervous, although for different reasons; they quickly began to transmit messages back home.Things went on like that for the next clan, and then the next. One by one, all day. Bai Xiaochun met with dozens of them.He didn\u2019t choose any of the clan daughters, and yet, neither did he refuse anyone. He merely told them that he needed some time to think, and that the matter was too weighty to decide on a whim. As for all of the \u2018introductory gifts,\u2019 he didn\u2019t refuse a single one.\u201cI, Bai Xiaochun, always handle all matters in a just and fair manner. Considering that I haven\u2019t yet chosen which honorable clan to ally with in marriage, I truly am unable to accept your gifts.\u201d Those were the words he would speak to each and every clan.Of course, the more he spoke in such a way, the more the cultivator clans insisted that he accept their gifts. In fact, they grew even more polite. Many of them went on to say that even if no marriage resulted, they still wished to be good friends. Only then did Bai Xiaochun reluctantly accept the gifts.Although they might be fools, the people from these cultivator clans weren\u2019t stupid. They knew that when Bai Xiaochun said he needed to think about the matter, he was most likely just waiting to see which clan would make the best offer.That, of course, was within the purvey of expectation. Furthermore, all of them feared that if they didn\u2019t offer their gifts, Bai Xiaochun wouldn\u2019t even consider their clan daughter to be his Daoist partner. The result was that the next day, the crowds hadn\u2019t thinned at all, and in fact, had grown more numerous. Furthermore, some of the cultivator clans even went so far as to say that even if their clan daughter couldn\u2019t become Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Daoist partner, they were still willing for her to be a maidservant to warm his bed at night. As long as she could pass on his bloodline, and he acknowledged them formally, that would be sufficient.All of the visiting clans continued to offer more and more gifts. In fact, it got to the point where Bai Xiaochun was getting a bit nervous. Eventually, he truly wanted to refuse, and yet wasn\u2019t able to.\u201cFine, I guess I\u2019ll accept\u2026. Not accepting isn\u2019t really an option, huh?\u201d For seven or eight days in a row, he continued to receive the clans and accept their gifts. Every morning at dawn, he would walk out to find a whole host of people waiting for him.Three more days passed. When dawn broke, Bai Xiaochun pushed open the main gate, whereupon his jaw dropped. Shockingly\u2026 not a single person could be seen. Everything was peaceful and quiet; as far as the eye could see, the area was empty.The only things he could see were some five-colored phoenixes, flying gracefully high above. The phoenixes were the beloved pets of Elder Zhou, and often soared above Fragrant Cloud Peak around dawn. They would usually fly together in a flock, and were especially beautiful. Many disciples were jealous of them.Bai Xiaochun rubbed his eyes and looked around. Thinking that perhaps he had opened the gate incorrectly, he went back in, closed it, and then tried again. However, the result was the same.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he thought, shocked. He quickly went off to find Hou Yunfei to ask for an explanation.Hou Yunfei sighed and looked at Bai Xiaochun. \u201cLast night, the sect leader issued a Dharmic decree. As your Elder Brother, he notified the cultivator clans\u2026 that according to sect rules, you can\u2019t accept a Daoist partner within the next hundred years. Therefore\u2026 everyone had no choice but to leave.\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s jaw dropped. Feeling very wronged, he said, \u201cNo more income\u2026. No more marriage\u2026.\u201dHou Yunfei wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry. A moment later, though, he thought of something, and said, \u201cXiaochun, a friend of mine from Green Crest Peak told me that you and Shangguan Tianyou have a beef with each other. Is that right? Well, just be aware that Qian Dajin isn\u2019t important at all. However you choose to deal with him, the sect will tacitly agree. But things aren\u2019t so simple when it comes to Shangguan Tianyou!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018not so simple?\u2019\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked. \u201cIs he more important than me or something?\u201d Having been a member of the Spirit Stream Sect for so many years, Bai Xiaochun was well aware of how the sect tried to train its disciples. They pushed them toward greatness, prohibited deadly conflicts, and encouraged both cooperation and competition. Sect rules governed basic behavior. The elders of the various mountain peaks, as well as the Peak Lords themselves, provided assistance and training. And the Hall of Justice was a looming threat to deter bad behavior. The sect essentially had all aspects under control.Of course, considering that between the north and south banks the Spirit Stream Sect had several hundred thousand disciples, it was obviously impossible to micromanage everything. Disciples would have conflicts and fights, and certain improper attitudes were impossible to control. However, the rewards and punishments in place were clear, and anyone who violated them would be strictly dealt with!Bai Xiaochun had performed an incredible service for the sect, possessed profound skill with plants and vegetation, and could unleash extraordinary battle prowess. The sect was naturally aware of that, and valued him greatly. Of course, they didn\u2019t cater to his every whim like a servant. If people insulted or provoked him, they wouldn\u2019t leap out to protect him\u2026. No disciple enjoyed such treatment, neither Shangguan Tianyou nor Bai Xiaochun.Because of that, Bai Xiaochun was of the belief that Shangguan Tianyou, an arrogant, famous Chosen who other Outer Sect disciple went so far as to call Young Lord, was still not worthy of his own attention.After a moment of thought, Hou Yunfei responded, eyes shining as he told Bai Xiaochun everything he knew: \u201cShangguan Tianyou has great ambitions. He hopes that one day he will be able to enter the legendary Legacy Echelon. As such, he has continuously kept his cultivation base suppressed, keeping him between the Outer and Inner Sects. When the next trial by fire for Chosen from the north and south banks comes, he wants to take first place, and enter the Inner Sect at the top. That will earn him the chance to enter the Legacy Echelon. Were it not for that, he would have long since applied for an ordinary trial by fire to enter the Inner Sect. After all, anyone who reaches the eighth level of Qi Condensation may do so.\u201dShocked, Bai Xiaochun asked, \u201cHow come everyone wants to get into the Legacy Echelon? Xu Baocai told me that Zhou Xinqi, Lu Tianlei, and everyone else wants to.\u201d\u201cMembers of the Legacy Echelon have a similar status to Prestige disciples. However, it\u2019s a different branch within the Spirit Stream Sect. You see, the Spirit Stream Sect is different from other sects. We have two branches, one of which focuses on protecting the sect, and one of which focuses on increasing its glory and power!\u201cEveryone from the servants to the disciples in the third level of Qi Condensation are lumped together in one lower group. Those from the fourth to the eighth level of Qi Condensation constitute the Outer Sect. At the eighth level, you can apply for a trial by fire to enter the Inner Sect.\u201cIf you can reach Foundation Establishment\u2026 then you can become a Foundation Establishment elder, and maybe even a Peak Lord. After two sixty-year-cycles pass, if you break through to the Gold Core level, then you can become a Prime Elder, responsible for protecting and managing the sect. That is the first branch.\u201cThe second branch is the Legacy Echelon!\u201cThere is only one way to get in, and that is\u2026 to break through to the Gold Core level before two sixty-year-cycles pass. From then on, you will become a tool to ensure that our sect earns an even greater position in the cultivation world, that it acquires\u2026 even more powerful resources and wealth! Anyone who takes first place in the Chosen battles will be in line to enter the Legacy Echelon. I\u2019m not really sure about the exact details, but I do know that there are rules about the whole thing!\u201cThe only thing is, reaching the Gold Core level before two sixty-year-cycles pass is very, very difficult\u2026. Of the members of the previous generation, the only person who has even come close is Peak Lord Li Qinghou. That\u2019s why the sect favors him so much!\u201dBai Xiaochun took a deep breath. This was his first time hearing an explanation of the Legacy Echelon, which also gave him a much clearer understanding of the sect itself. Soon, he left, and as he made his way off, he continued to ponder the matter.\u201cLegacy Echelon\u2026?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked up at the sky, then around at the surrounding scenery, and thought about the cultivator clans. In his opinion, his Elder Brother Sect Leader had acted a bit domineering, and yet\u2026 even though it was now impossible to collect any more gifts, at least there was no need to return the ones he had already taken.\u201cYeah! It\u2019s not my fault! It\u2019s the fault of Elder Brother Sect Leader\u2019s Dharmic decree!\u201d Having reached this point in his train of thought, Bai Xiaochun felt a bit better. After organizing all of the gifts, he went down to the market to buy a large quantity of medicinal plant ingredients for tier-2 spirit medicines. Then, he returned to the Medicine Concocting Pavilion to continue his cultivation and concocting work.The truth was that originally, Zheng Yuandong didn\u2019t want to get involved in the matter with Bai Xiaochun and the cultivator clans. However, the events had unfolded in shocking fashion. The previous nine Prestige disciples had all been conferred their titles posthumously, after being killed in battle. Furthermore, all of them had been members of various other cultivator clans. Although none of them had ever had any direct descendants, they all had relatives among their various clans. Because of that, no problems had ever arisen, and their clans had smoothly transitioned into being Prestige clans.Of course, the sect highly valued and also protected such clans.But now, Bai Xiaochun was a living Prestige disciple, a terrifying status to say the least. At first, it hadn\u2019t been obvious, and time had simply passed by. Zheng Yuandong and many others never thought much about what it meant to have a living Prestige scion in their midst, and how enticing such a person would be to the cultivator clans.But then, the cultivator clans began to show up in great numbers. At first, Zheng Yuandong had merely observed the goings-on. As far as he was concerned, it didn\u2019t really matter which clan Bai Xiaochun picked. How could he have ever imagined that with all the competition, the clans would have gone to the lengths of offering their clan daughters as handmaidens, just to acquire someone with Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bloodline?Zhao Yuandong could only imagine what would happen if Bai Xiaochun\u2019s gave in to the temptation. If that happened\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be long before he could sire hundreds of descendants. According to the clan rules, all first generation descendants of a Prestige disciple were automatically allowed to enter the Inner Sect, and would receive special treatment and training. Furthermore\u2026. after those descendants began to propagate, there would be hundreds of branches of the Prestige clan. Within a few hundred years, the entire Spirit Stream Sect would be filled with the Bai Clan\u2026. The final results would be grave indeed.In addition to all that\u2026 as long as Bai Xiaochun remained alive, all he had to do was continue to sire offspring, and the matter would never end. He would become a living nightmare for the sect.Because of such considerations, Zheng Yuandong held an emergency meeting with the sect elders, including the prime elders. Their joint decision was that Bai Xiaochun could not accept a Daoist partner for a hundred years. Although it was a bit overbearing, Zheng Yuandong felt that there was no other option. He didn\u2019t want to bet everything on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s ability to resist temptation. He could only hope that after a hundred years, Bai Xiaochun would grow up and be a bit more mature.Time passed. Soon, a year had gone by.During that time, it was almost as if Bai Xiaochun had gone missing from the south bank. Few people ever saw him. He spent all of his time concocting medicine and practicing cultivation. He rarely left the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, where he worked hard at producing tier-2 spirit medicine.His cultivation base had also slowly made progress. Soon, he was in the middle of the seventh level of Qi Condensation. Furthermore, he resolved one problem after another when it came to concocting tier-2 spirit medicine.The truth was that most other journeyman apothecaries at his level would have long since concocted tier-2 medicines. But Bai Xiaochun was stubborn, and refused to start concocting another batch without first resolving each and every problem he found in the previous batch.Eventually, after an entire year, he was finally convinced that he had resolved all of the issues regarding the concoction of tier-2 spirit medicine. With all the problems gone, he began yet another batch.\u201cViolet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills!\u201d he exclaimed, eyes bloodshot. They were a tier-2 medicinal pill suitable for the eighth level of Qi Condensation and under. Following the recipe precisely, he selected numerous types of plants and vegetation, organized them carefully, and then began to feed them into the pill furnace.After carefully adjusting the Earthflame, he kept a close eye on the pill furnace, occasionally adjusting the spiritual energy he fed inside. After six hours passed, the pill furnace suddenly began to shake. A strong medicinal aroma wafted out, and Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes began to shine brightly. Leaning toward the pill furnace, he slapped it on the side, whereupon three red medicinal pills flew out.\u201cIt worked!\u201d he exclaimed excitedly. Grabbing the three pills, he looked them over. But then, his eyes went wide. \u201cEee? Hold on a second. Something\u2019s not right. According to the description, Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills are supposed to be violet. How come these ones are red?\u201dAfter scratching his head for a moment, he lifted the pills up to his nose and inhaled deeply. The medicinal aroma was strong, and contained plenty of spiritual energy. However, the smell was somewhat odd, and considering that they were the incorrect color, he didn\u2019t dare to consume them.Sitting there thoughtfully, he thought back to all of the various steps he had taken during the concocting process. Two hours later, his eyes snapped open, and he laughed bitterly.\u201cI put in a bit too much Superagate Flower pollen. That tainted the rest of the medicinal plant ingredients, producing this strange side-effect.\u201d With that, he placed the three red medicinal pills off to the side, and once again began to concoct.This time, when the pill furnace began to shake, and the medicinal aroma spread out, a single violet medicinal pill flew out. After examining it closely, an expression of deep satisfaction appeared on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face.He quickly began another batch. In the following days, he continued to produce more batches, until he had a few dozen Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills. That having been accomplished, he sat down off to the side, exhausted. After some rest, he produced the red pills and looked at them with some hesitation. As far as he was concerned, each and every one of the pills he had just concocted was very valuable, and furthermore, when it came to ingredients, he was already starting to run short.\u201cAccording to the concocting instructions, as long as the pill is formed, it counts as a success. These red Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills have a bit too much Superagate Flower pollen, which caused their color to change. However, all that means is that they will have lost some effectiveness.\u201d After a moment of hesitation, he slapped his bag of holding to produce a green bamboo needle.It was an item he had acquired from the sect for use in medicine concocting, which could be used to make a general assessment of whether any given medicinal pill was toxic or not. After carefully inserting the needle into one of the red medicinal pills, he waited for a moment, then pulled it back out. The bamboo needle looked exactly the same as before, as opposed to being black.\u201cNot toxic!\u201d he said with a sigh of relief. However, out of caution, he still chose not to consume any of the red pills. Instead, he held them in hand as he left the Medicine Concocting Pavilion. Outside in the dawn air, he began to walk down one of the small paths that wound through the sect.Up above, he could see a flock of five-colored phoenixes gliding elegantly through the air, occasionally making piercing cries that echoed out. Ignoring the phoenixes, he headed toward one of the local Spirit Tail Chicken farms, where he acquired a spirit tail chicken. After returning to his courtyard, he put the chicken down and then tossed one of the red medicinal pills out in front of it.The spirit tail chicken had originally been sitting there looking a bit tired. But then it caught sight of the red medicinal pill. A tremor ran through it, and it suddenly leapt to its feet, rushed forward and pecked down toward the pill.However, it was at this exact moment that an intensely powerful cry rang out from up above. Then, a powerful wind gusted by, and before the spirit tail chicken could reach the pill, it was blown off of its feet.A bit frightened, Bai Xiaochun leaped backward. At the same time, the five-colored phoenixes closed in from up above, eyes wide, fighting amongst themselves the entire way. Finally, one of the strongest among the group, a male, succeeded in shoving aside his companions, whereupon he snapped up the medicinal pill and swallowed it down.Looking with contempt at the spirit tail chicken that had been blown off to the side, the phoenix then flew up gracefully into the air. Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry. Eyes wide, he could do nothing but watch as the phoenix ascended upward.However, after flying only a short way, the elegant phoenix began to shake, and then let out a protracted wail. His eyes turned bright red as they filled with veins of blood. All of his feathers suddenly stood on end, making him look like a fireball that was about to explode.Even more shocking was that the powerful male phoenix\u2019s muscles began to swell and ripple. Cracking sounds emanated out as the entire phoenix grew larger. Most notable of all was how the feathered area between his two legs suddenly bulged with something hard and rod-like\u2026.A very peculiar expression could be seen on the face of the male phoenix as he looked around at the other phoenixes.The other phoenixes trembled, and were about to scatter, when the male phoenix charged madly toward them. Next, miserable shrieks began to ring out.Bai Xiaochun stood there in his courtyard, looking on aghast as the bulging male phoenix\u2026 violated all of the other phoenixes. Moments later, unsated, the phoenix turned in his direction, his eyes burning just as red as before, his entire body seemingly bursting with flames.Terrified, Bai Xiaochun fled, barely able to hold back from screaming.Thankfully, the phoenix was actually targeting, not him, but the spirit tail chicken\u2026.Soon after, he watched as the male phoenix flew back toward the top of the mountain, clamoring loudly the entire way. Only after that did Bai Xiaochun wipe the sweat off of his brow.\u201cSimply terrifying\u2026.\u201d he thought, looking down at the remaining two medicinal pills he held in hand. \u201cJust what kind of medicinal pills are these!?!?\u201d His heart began to pound as he realized that they must be some type of aphrodisiac. Clearly\u2026 they were also very effective.**That day was a day that would never be forgotten by the disciples of Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2026.All birds on the mountain, regardless of what type they were, were ravaged by Elder Zhou\u2019s maddened phoenix\u2026. Countless disciples watched as one bird after another let out miserable shrieks. Although the birds tried as best they could to escape, none of them were a match for Elder Zhou\u2019s phoenix. None managed to flee\u2026.The villainous phoenix didn\u2019t even spare the spirit tail chickens, much less the other birds that Elder Zhou had raised. Anything on the mountain with wings\u2026 experienced a living nightmare that day.All of the disciples were talking about the matter, and their hearts trembled. Soon, word spread to Violet Cauldron Peak and Green Crest Peak. Some people even came over to see the miraculous events which were unfolding for themselves.\u201cDid you hear that over on Fragrant Cloud Peak, one of Elder Zhou\u2019s phoenixes went mad? It started pouncing on any bird it saw\u2026.\u201d\u201cI saw it with my own eyes. What a savage phoenix! It didn\u2019t even spare the passing magpies\u2026.\u201d\u201cJust what was Elder Zhou doing, huh? How could he let his phoenix act like that\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt was really infuriating, you know? That phoenix seemed really turned on! It pounced on some of those birds over and over again. It was brutal!\u201dWhen Bai Xiaochun heard the talk going around the sect, he began to tremble, and even felt a bit guilty.\u201cIt isn\u2019t my fault\u2026.\u201d he said to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s really not my fault\u2026. I was trying to give that pill to the spirit tail chicken\u2026. That phoenix stole it!\u201d Feeling wronged, he hurried back to the Medicine Concocting Pavilion. After some thought, he came to the conclusion that there was no way anyone would figure out what had happened.There he sat in the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, sighing as he pulled out the remaining two red medicinal pills, which he then looked at thoughtfully.\u201cThese medicinal pills are actually really powerful. Maybe I could use them as trump cards in a fight\u2026. If I ever run into some wild beasts in the future, I\u2019ll have nothing to fear.\u201cWell, if I want to use them as trump cards, then I better create another pill which can incite intense desire in females. The two can complement each other.\u201d Bai Xiaochun could well imagine how two such pills could work together. If he encountered some dangerous beast in the future, he would merely throw a pill in one direction and then run off in the other.It was an exciting prospect, but the downside was that he had no medicinal formula to work with. After pondering the matter for a while, and considering all of the various types of plants and vegetation that he knew about, he mentally prepared his own medicine formula.About the time that Bai Xiaochun was considering how to create his own medicine formula, Elder Zhou returned to his residence at the top of Fragrant Cloud Peak. There, he stared at the ravaged and listless phoenixes, and then turned his head to see the male phoenix off in the distance, pouncing on a spirit tail chicken. Miserable shrieks then began to ring out.Elder Zhou\u2019s mind almost exploded. Trembling violently, he stood there feeling as if the entire world were spinning around him. Enraged, he cried out, \u201cWho did this!?!?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 74: So, It Was Bai Xiaochun!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74: So, It Was Bai Xiaochun!Elder Zhou\u2019s voice filled the entirety of Fragrant Cloud Peak, echoing out in all directions. Strange expressions could be seen on the faces of countless disciples as they heard his words. After all, the events of that day had shaken everyone\u2026.The other elders on Fragrant Cloud Peak were also shocked by the ghastly events. The male phoenix was one of Elder Zhou\u2019s beloved pets, and therefore, no one was willing to even get near it. If the maddened beast were to accidentally be harmed, Elder Zhou would certainly be incensed.Most importantly\u2026 Elder Zhou was the only person on Fragrant Cloud Peak who enjoyed raising fine birds, and considering it was his personal affair, no one was willing to interfere.As for the spirit tail chickens\u2026 Li Qinghou was away, and his apprentice Zhou Xinqi had little power to do anything. Besides, the male phoenix was especially powerful, leaving Zhou Xinqi with no other option than to observe from afar, her face flushed, not daring to even step forward.When Elder Zhou saw what was happening, he couldn\u2019t stop shaking. His heart twinged as he watched the clamoring phoenix, and when he looked around at the rest of the dispirited and listless birds, he wished to cry, and yet could find no tears.Considering Elder Zhou\u2019s skill in the Dao of medicine, he could tell at a glance that someone had given the phoenix some sort of medicine.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely find out who was responsible for this!!\u201dMeanwhile, Bai Xiaochun was in his workstation in the Medicine Concocting Pavilion. Although he was mostly cut off from the sounds outside, Elder Zhou\u2019s enraged roar reached his ears, and his heart trembled. Then an outraged expression appeared on his face as he contemplated how he was truly being unfairly accused\u2026.He could only hope that it would be impossible to connect the matter to him, and that Elder Zhou wouldn\u2019t come after him\u2026. Scowling, he began to recall the exact steps he had gone through to create the aphrodisiac pill, and began to contemplate how to make it even more effective.After several days of study and contemplation, he went out a few times to purchase medicinal plants, and even spent some merit points to acquire a few other rare ingredients. Finally, he returned to the Medicine Concocting Pavilion to attempt to concoct the pill.Soon, explosions began to ring out. In some ways, it was true that Bai Xiaochun had already created his own medicine formula back in the trial by fire to become a journeyman apothecary. However, that was more a situation of enlightenment and adjustments to an existing formula.It was different from the current situation, in which was truly inventing something new. The levels of difficulty couldn\u2019t even be compared. In fact, based on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s skill in the Dao of medicine at the time of his promotion to journeyman apothecary, he would never have been able to do something like this. But now, after a year of experience and further research into the Dao of medicine, he was more than ready to make such an attempt.Although he wasn\u2019t fully proficient, he had already begun to walk a path that other journeyman apothecaries couldn\u2019t even imagine. It was a path that only master apothecaries could attempt to understand.Time passed. Half a month later, Bai Xiaochun was still in the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, immersed in his attempt to create a medicine formula. After numerous attempts, he was beginning to shape his ideas into one concise concept.Even as he excitedly began to concoct another batch, Elder Zhou stood atop Fragrant Cloud Peak, a pained expression on his face as he fed a medicinal pill to a weak, listless phoenix.\u201cRelax and recover,\u201d he said. \u201cAll those things you did weren\u2019t in accord with your true desires. None of it was your fault. Just wait until you\u2019ve recovered, and I\u2019ll take you to find the person who fed that pill to you. I don\u2019t care who it is, I will see to it that he pays the price!!\u201d A brutal gleam appeared in Elder Zhou\u2019s eyes. During the past half month, he had conducted a thorough investigation of Fragrant Cloud Peak, and had even made inquiries in the other mountain peaks of the south bank.Unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t turned up a single clue. The only option he had next was to wait until the phoenix recovered, and then take it to search for the culprit.During the course of his investigation, he had come to find that Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2026 had become a place that winged birds avoided like the plague\u2026.Because of the tragic events which had occurred half a month before, it was as if the air above the mountain had been filled with a shocking aroma. Any bird who smelled it wouldn\u2019t dare to draw near. Even the spirit tail chickens spent their days trembling and scared out of their minds. The disciples who cared for the chickens could only scowl miserably, not daring to give voice to their anger.As the matter festered, a whole series of rumors began to spread\u2026.\u201cDo you remember what happened with the birds a few weeks ago? I heard that the bird in question ate some of Elder Zhou\u2019s medicine. That\u2019s why it changed so suddenly\u2026. The only thing I don\u2019t understand is that Elder Zhou is still pretty young. Why would he be concocting medicine like that\u2026?\u201d\u201cShhh\u2026 keep your voice down! Do you know why Elder Zhou likes to raise birds\u2026? There\u2019s a very tragic secret involved. The truth is that for his entire life, Elder Zhou has never had a Daoist partner! Ahem\u2026 you know what I mean, right?\u201d\u201cHeavens! How deranged! Could it be that because that bird couldn\u2019t take any more of Elder Zhou\u2019s torment, it finally went mad?!?!\u201dThe more the rumors spread, the more exaggerated they became. Eventually, all of the disciples on Fragrant Cloud Peak were spreading them. When each person passed the news along, they couldn\u2019t help but add details from their own imagination, until countless versions of the story could be heard.When Elder Zhou caught wind of it, he got so mad he very nearly coughed up a mouthful of blood. He was of a mind to put an end to the rumors, but no matter how he tried to explain things to people, they would just look at him oddly. Although they quickly put respectful expressions on their faces, his explanations did no good, and the rumors continued to fly\u2026.Another half month passed. One day, Elder Zhou appeared, bristling with a murderous aura, his expression unprecedentedly ferocious. The wave of his hand sent the recovered male phoenix flying out. Surprisingly, it was just as large as it had been before, and was actually a bit stronger. Clearly, it had actually profited from its previous disaster\u2026.When Elder Zhou saw that, he felt a bit better. However, the anger in his heart still needed an outlet. He had seen the fear in the eyes of countless disciples in the sect over the last month; even members of his own generation cleared their throats in his presence, and wore odd expressions on their faces. And then there were the rumors, which left him seething in fury. At long last, he was able to bring his phoenix out into the open.\u201cFind me the person who gave you that medicine!!\u201d he said through gritted teeth.The phoenix let out a piercing cry as it flew up into the air. Elder Zhou followed along, his murderous aura growing more and more intense. Quite a few disciples on Fragrant Cloud Peak were paying attention to the goings-on, and some of them even began to follow from a distance.Soon, it was obvious that the male phoenix was flying toward Bai Xiaochun\u2019s residence. When it arrived, it began to fly in circles up above. Then it turned and glanced at Elder Zhou, looking very maligned as it let out whimpering calls. Apparently, it was telling Elder Zhou that this was the place where it had consumed the medicinal pill.When the disciples who had followed along saw what was happening, their eyes went wide. But then they realized who the residence belonged to, and they blinked oddly.\u201cThat looks like\u2026 Sect Uncle Bai\u2019s residence.\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s definitely Sect Uncle Bai\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmm. If the matter were blamed on anyone else, I might not believe it. But considering we\u2019re talking about Sect Uncle Bai\u2026 it actually makes sense!\u201dElder Zhou hovered there in midair, trembling, eyes crimson. Gnashing his teeth, he growled, \u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201dNow that he had found the culprit of the disaster, he scanned the area with divine sense. Having found that the residence was empty, he waved his right hand, producing a jade slip that, based on his authority in the sect, could track Bai Xiaochun down wherever he was.Soon, he found that Bai Xiaochun was in the Medicine Concocting Pavilion.Normally, Elder Zhou was a calm person, but right now his face twisted with ferocious anger as he led his phoenix toward the Medicine Concocting Pavilion. The surrounding disciples of Fragrant Cloud Peak were starting to get excited. They began to send messages to their friends, and soon word was spreading throughout the mountain.\u201cHurry up! The culprit who drove that bird crazy has been found out!\u201d\u201cSect Uncle Bai did it!!\u201dCountless disciples, even some from the Inner Sect, all heard the news. Trembling with excitement, they hurried out to see what they could see.The feelings of torment they had experienced because of Bai Xiaochun now turned into anticipation. In fact, the more torment they had experienced, the more excited they were now. Chen Zi\u2019ang rushed out, looking thrilled. Zhao Yiduo raced out at about the same time. The two of them exchanged pleased glances, and then raced in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction as quickly as possible.Among the crowd was one particularly burly man, whose cheeks were wet with tears. It was none other than than the self-proclaimed Lord Wolf, Liu Ergou. Throwing his head back, he roared, \u201cJudgement comes!\u201dEven as all of Fragrant Cloud Peak was thrown into a commotion, Bai Xiaochun was there in the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, looking excitedly at the pill furnace in front of him. It was trembling, and a strong medicinal aroma wafted out from it as several white medicinal pills appeared.These pills currently had no names, and were not meant to be consumed by humans. In fact, if you pushed down on them too hard, they would collapse into dust. They had only one use\u2026 to make male animals incredibly attractive to whoever consumed the pill.Bai Xiaochun had filled them with several powerful stimulants, and had even gone to the trouble of procuring some spirit creature ingredients from the north bank. The cost was high, but he had succeeded.The pills were not weak by any means. Although Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t sure exactly how powerful they were, he could well guess, and was sure that they weren\u2019t inferior at all. Actually, to ensure that they were as powerful as possible, he had even performed spirit enhancements on all of the ingredients before using them.Face bright with anticipation, he looked down at the white medicinal pills, trying to imagine the results of using the pills in concert with the aphrodisiac pills. He couldn\u2019t hold back from laughing.\u201cThis will be the Pheromone Pill. That sounds good. And the red one from before will be the Aphrodisiac Pill!\u201d After a bit more thought, he performed threefold spirit enhancements on all of them.In the briefest of moments, the medicinal pills completely changed. No longer were they low-grade, but instead, superior-grade!!As for their medicinal efficacy\u2026 Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes shone at the mere thought of it.\u201cHmph! Now it doesn\u2019t matter what kind of beast I face, from now on, when I say jump, they\u2019ll jump!\u201d Coughing dryly, he put the medicinal pills away. Feeling very proud of himself, he was just about to go outside and take a walk when\u2026He heard an enraged roar echoing down from the sky.\u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201dChapter 74: So, It Was Bai Xiaochun!\u2014Translator: Deathblade.

On the other hand, I seem to be allergic to Chinese mosquitoes. When they bite me, the bite swells up to the size of a small fruit. Currently, there seems to be a mosquito lurking hidden in my room somewhere that comes out in the dark of night to feast on my feet and legs.

Leaves fell, to be picked up by the raging wind, which swept them to and fro.When Bai Xiaochun heard the enraged cry, he was so scared he almost jumped straight up into the air. He looked up, and saw the white-haired Elder Zhou hovering up above, veins bulging out all over his neck and face.Elder Zhou seemed like a wild beast, and in fact, actually looked quite similar to the way the phoenix had a month ago\u2026.\u201cBai Xiaochun, it was you that harmed my phoenix. On this day, even if Li Qinghou tries to interfere, I will teach you a harsh and bitter lesson!\u201d With another thunderous roar, he extended his right hand and made a vicious grasping gesture in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction.That gesture caused the air around Bai Xiaochun to begin to solidify. Bai Xiaochun trembled inwardly and let out a miserable shriek. A silver glow sprang out from his skin, and at the same time, a white light appeared further out as he activated the Divine Crane Shield. From a distance, it almost looked like an eggshell.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to kill me! He\u2019s trying to kill me!!\u201d As soon as the light enveloped him, he ignored the pressure crushing down from Elder Zhou and unhesitatingly shot off at the highest speed possible.\u201cEee?\u201d murmured Elder Zhou. Although he hadn\u2019t used his full strength, considering he was in the early Foundation Establishment stage, even a fraction of his power should have been enough to prevent any Qi Condensation cultivator from breaking free.Looking at the light-wreathed Bai Xiaochun fleeing off into the distance, he roared, \u201cBai Xiaochun, do you really think I don\u2019t know that you were out to harm me even when you were back in the Ovens? I know that the ginseng root that was meant for my soup was eaten by you, all the way down to the spirit rootlets! I also know that it was your idea to make the bowls shallower. And now you went and fed some medicine to my phoenix! On this very day, I will ensure that you come to understand the severe consequences of stirring up trouble in our sect!\u201dWith that he gave chase.The truth was that all of the elders in the sect knew about the things that went on in the Ovens.\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shrieked miserably. \u201cThat bird of yours stole my medicinal pill! I really had nothing to do with it!\u201d Looking back over his shoulder, he saw the overly aggressive Elder Zhou, his cultivation base unfathomable. Bai Xiaochun immediately pushed forward with as much speed as possible, as if his life depended on it, rapidly transforming into nothing more than a set of afterimages.Up in midair, the male phoenix heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words, and his feathers immediately stood on end. Letting out a miserable squawk, he pointed his wings at Bai Xiaochun, and if he could talk, he would obviously be crying hysterically to everyone present that it was Bai Xiaochun who had given him the medicine. He most certainly hadn\u2019t stolen it!!\u201cY-you\u2026!\u201d Seeing the phoenix falsely accuse him made Bai Xiaochun feel worse than before. How could he ever have imagined that, given how smart he was, he would one day be framed by a bird?Hatred filled his heart. Looking at the bird, he decided firmly in his heart that once this matter was resolved, he would ensure that bird felt what it was like to be humiliated. The bird might be a male, but Bai Xiaochun would find an even manlier bird to teach it a lesson.\u201cHow dare you quibble over meaningless details!\u201d Elder Zhou said, picking up speed. As he shot toward Bai Xiaochun, he waved his sleeve, causing a massive power to shoot through the air. When it landed on Bai Xiaochun, however, he merely staggered a bit, and then picked up speed as if nothing had happened.The scene caused Elder Zhou\u2019s eyes to widen. He had used enough power to send any other Outer Sect disciple tumbling to the ground, and yet Bai Xiaochun treated it as if it were nothing.Bai Xiaochun was also shocked. The blow just now had shaken him down to his teeth, and left him trembling. Looking back at Elder Zhou, he quickly produced the Golden Crow Sword and poured some spiritual power into it. The golden crow materialized, and Bai Xiaochun transformed into a golden beam of light that shot up into the air.Elder Zhou snorted coldly, and also flew up, joined by his phoenix.All of the observing disciples in the area felt quite pleased at the ability to revel in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s misfortune. Seeing him flee madly for his life enabled them all to release a bit of the anger which had been festering inside of them.Wide smiles blossomed on the faces of Chen Zi\u2019ang and Zhao Yiduo, and Liu Ergou, the so-called Lord Wolf, was so happy that tears streamed down his face.\u201cThe heavens do have eyes!!\u201d he murmured.Flying through the air over Fragrant Cloud Peak, Bai Xiaochun let out a miserable cry. Anyone who wasn\u2019t watching what was happening but heard that scream would be completely shocked.\u201cElder Zhou, your bird\u2019s lying! I\u2019m telling the truth, and he\u2019s making stuff up!\u201d Bai Xiaochun wanted to cry, but no tears would come. He stood atop the golden crow, pushing forward with everything he could muster.\u201cShut up!\u201d Elder Zhou roared. It was bad enough that Bai Xiaochun was constantly saying all kinds of things about his bird, but even worse, there were plenty of people who could hear it, and all of them had odd expressions on their faces. Elder Zhou\u2019s right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, causing a blast of air to shoot toward Bai Xiaochun.\u201cBut it\u2019s true! Your bird is falsely accusing me!\u201d Bai Xiaochun just wanted to resolve the situation, and yet, the blast of air continued to close in, leaving him trembling in fear. Somehow pushing forward with even more speed, he managed to avoid the blast, and it smashed a sizeable hole into a nearby boulder.Bai Xiaochun looked over his shoulder at the hole, and his scalp went numb. Finally, he decided to call upon his most powerful backer, \u201cI\u2019m the Junior Brother of the Sect Leader! I\u2019m the apprentice of Daoist Master Spiritsieve!\u201d\u201cNobody can help you now!\u201d Elder Zhou said, glaring. The truth was that he was actually losing a bit of face by personally chasing after Bai Xiaochun. What was even worse was that he hadn\u2019t even touched Bai Xiaochun, who was fleeing like a rabbit whose tail had been stepped on. It was truly a miserable sight.Somewhere on Fragrant Cloud Peak, Xu Baocai looked up at what was happening, mixed emotions on his face. Of course, he wasn\u2019t worried about Bai Xiaochun. Rather, he felt bad for Elder Zhou, and couldn\u2019t help but think back to his own past.\u201cStop running, Bai Xiaochun!!\u201d Elder Zhou cried, closing in like a powerful roc. Next to him, his phoenix continued to let out piercing cries, and occasionally pointed at Bai Xiaochun with his wings.\u201cI\u2019m a Prestige disciple!\u201d Bai Xiaochun screamed. \u201cI\u2019ve shed blood for the sect! I\u2019ve performed incredible service!!\u201d As he fled for his life, his words echoed out even to Violet Cauldron Peak. Many people there looked up and saw Bai Xiaochun in full flight, and strange expressions quickly filled their faces. When they realized what was happening, they couldn\u2019t hold back from laughing.\u201cThat title is given to the dead,\u201d Elder Zhou growled. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you into a true Prestige disciple!\u201d The truth was that he didn\u2019t really plan to kill Bai Xiaochun. He just wanted to teach him a very hard lesson. Hoping to scare him, he waved his hand again, sending out another blast of wind, which caused a vortex to spring up around Bai Xiaochun.When Bai Xiaochun heard Elder Zhou\u2019s words, and then saw the wind vortex appear, he screamed even harder than before. He poured all of the spiritual power he could muster into the Golden Crow Sword. Bai Xiaochun burst out from within the vortex, surrounded by golden light, shooting all the way to the midway point between Fragrant Cloud Peak and Mount Daoseed. It was only then that the light began to fade.Silver light glittered around him as he charged onward, screaming. He was well aware that Li Qinghou wasn\u2019t in the sect at the moment, and that the only person who could save him was his Elder Brother Sect Leader, which was why he was now heading toward Mount Daoseed.Elder Zhou was inwardly shocked that Bai Xiaochun had been able to dodge his attacks so many times, and was now sure that this was one of the reasons he\u2019d been able to make it out alive when being pursued by the Luochen Clan.However, considering that there were so many people watching, it left Elder Zhou with little face, and only served to fuel his anger. Unleashing all of his cultivation base, he shot after Bai Xiaochun once again.\u201cElder Brother Sect Leader, save me!\u201d Bai Xiaochun wailed at the top of his lungs. Whistling through the air at top speed, he continued to evade Elder Zhou as he headed toward Mount Daoseed. His incredible agility made him very slippery.Of course, if Elder Zhou truly unleashed all of his Foundation Establishment divine abilities and techniques, he would probably have been able to pin Bai Xiaochun down. However, all he wanted to do was teach him a lesson. If he started using magical techniques, and didn\u2019t reign in their power perfectly, he could very well deliver a fatal blow.However, at the moment, he couldn\u2019t even hit Bai Xiaochun at all, and yet, Bai Xiaochun was screaming miserably, which caused Elder Zhou to get even more angry. He quickly performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, causing dark clouds to form in the sky above. Thunder crashed as lightning suddenly shot down toward Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were as round as saucers. The terrifying power he sensed within the lightning left his mind somewhat blank. Eyes bloodshot, he performed a double-handed incantation gesture and then pointed out. Instantly, violet qi appeared above his head, which shot toward the lightning.Elder Zhou was astonished. He\u2019d set out to simply scare Bai Xiaochun, and although the lightning seemed like an attack, he\u2019d aimed it to land next to Bai Xiaochun, not on him. But now, Bai Xiaochun was actually fighting back against it, causing Elder Zhou to suddenly try to reign the lightning in. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t stop all of it.Violet qi swirled up from Bai Xiaochun to meet the lightning, and as it did, the image of a cauldron appeared. When it slammed into the lightning, massive rumbling sounds echoed out, shaking everything in the area. The violet qi scattered, and as for the lightning, it dimmed by about half before slamming into the ground.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face went pale, and he let out another plaintive scream.\u201cSave me, Elder Brother! Save me, Master! Oh that the spirit of my Master in the heavens would save me!!\u201dElder Zhou stopped in place in midair, looking at Bai Xiaochun in surprise. Just now, he had managed to reduce the power of the lightning by about half, but even the remaining bit should have been enough to seriously injure any Qi Condensation cultivator. And yet, other than causing Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face to go pale, and sending his qi and blood into chaos, it had done little else.\u201cThat was\u2026 Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning,\u201d Elder Zhou murmured to himself. \u201cDu Lingfei and Hou Yunfei both said that Bai Xiaochun had gained enlightenment of Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning, but that level of power exceeds the seventh level of Qi Condensation. The battle prowess this kid can unleash with that technique is incredible!\u201dA strange light gleamed in Elder Zhou\u2019s eyes. Now that he realized Bai Xiaochun was a Chosen of this caliber, some of his anger was mitigated. Furthermore, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s ear-splitting screaming left him unsure of whether to laugh or cry. With a cold snort, he once again gave chase.\u201cI don\u2019t care if the phoenix was at fault, Bai Xiaochun was the main cause. This kid is stubborn and mischievous; I need to take the chance to scare him into restraint.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But then Bai Xiaochun suddenly fought back against the lightning, and their expressions flickered. Many were about to intervene, but then they realized that the lightning didn\u2019t harm him at all.Strange gleams appeared in their eyes.\u201cThis kid is extraordinary!\u201d\u201cNo wonder the Luochen Clan couldn\u2019t chase him down and kill him! He has some very unique abilities!\u201d\u201cThis young scion of ours might just be on the same level as Shangguan Tianyou. He\u2019s clearly surpassed Lu Tianlei and Zhou Xinqi already!\u201dAs they looked on, nodding inwardly, Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong stood atop Mount Daoseed, watching the situation unfold with a strange look in his eyes. Even as Bai Xiaochun cried out at the top of his lungs, Zheng Yuandong was using divine sense to watch everything.He was shocked by what he saw Bai Xiaochun doing. Instead of immediately interfering, he waited, hoping to see Bai Xiaochun show off his full potential. Eventually, he began to nod with admiration. Finally, he flickered into motion, appearing directly in front of the madly-fleeing Bai Xiaochun.As soon as Bai Xiaochun saw Zheng Yuandong, he cried out, \u201cDear Elder Brother Sect Leader, Elder Zhou is trying to kill me! My poor little life is on the line!!\u201d Even as the words left his mouth, he dove behind Zheng Yuandong to hide.Zheng Yuandong coughed dryly at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s woeful appearance. Smiling wryly, he looked up at the incoming Elder Zhou, who was glaring fiercely at Bai Xiaochun. A moment later, Elder Zhou came to a stop in front of him, where he clasped hands in greeting.These two men were wily old foxes, and as soon as their eyes met, they both knew what the other was thinking. Both of them were well aware that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s presence meant that the sect had another fearfully talented person in its ranks. That was something far more important than the trifling incident with the phoenix.If Li Qinghou were in the sect, things would have been easier to keep under control. But with him gone, no one in the sect could really control Bai Xiaochun. That was especially true considering his recent achievements, coupled with the fact that he was a Prestige disciple and the Junior Brother of the sect leader.Zheng Yuandong was fairly certain that if he tried to punish Bai Xiaochun, Bai Xiaochun would simply go to the portrait of his Master to weep and complain.\u201cSect Leader,\u201d said Elder Zhou, \u201cplease pay no heed to this affair and hand Bai Xiaochun over to me immediately!\u201d With that, Elder Zhou glared at Bai Xiaochun, chuckling cruelly.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s scalp immediately went numb, and he began to explain, \u201cYour bird\u2013\u201dAs soon as Elder Zhou heard the word \u2018bird\u2019, his face began to turn green. Bai Xiaochun immediately bit his tongue and turned his pleading gaze to Zheng Yuandong.\u201cElder Brother,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve shed my own blood for the sect, I\u2019ve performed great services\u2026.\u201dZheng Yuandong\u2019s face twitched, and he coughed dryly.\u201cElder Zhou,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s drop this matter. Xiaochun might be a bit naughty and mischievous, but he\u2019s a good person. How about this. If anything like this happens again in the future, I won\u2019t intervene at all, and you can handle the matter any way you see fit.\u201dElder Zhou looked very torn, but eventually he nodded begrudgingly. Then he took his leave, casting one more glare at Bai Xiaochun as he did.Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and slowly rose to his feet. He looked a bit suspicious; he was an intelligent person, and the way things had turned out seemed very sudden. Something seemed off\u2026. However, he wasn\u2019t completely sure of what it all meant, so he looked over at the sect leader.Zheng Yuandong looked back at him. \u201cThose phoenixes were raised by Elder Zhou\u2019s former Daoist partner,\u201d he said coolly. \u201cThere was a battle once outside the sect in which that Daoist partner died in the process of saving Elder Zhou\u2019s life. Elder Zhou himself barely survived. The pain of losing his Daoist partner harmed his mind, and he nearly went insane.\u201cMost people think he\u2019s merely obsessed with plants and vegetation. What they don\u2019t know is that without that obsession, he wouldn\u2019t be able to suppress the insanity within. He uses that obsession to stave off the madness.\u201cIn the future, don\u2019t provoke him. If he really goes mad, I might not be able to save you in time.\u201dHearing this, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s spine tingled in fear, and yet, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit sorry for Elder Zhou. Nodding vigorously, he said, \u201cI really didn\u2019t give it the medicine. His thing\u2026 er, his bird really did steal it from me.\u201dZheng Yuandong patted Bai Xiaochun\u2019s shoulder. \u201cKarma exists everywhere. In this case, the Karma was sown by you, so there\u2019s no need to think too much about the details.\u201d With that, Zheng Yuandong turned and left.Bai Xiaochun sighed at how unlucky he was, and began to contemplate ways to avoid Elder Zhou in the future. Then he cautiously returned to Fragrant Cloud Peak, where he went into seclusion in his residence.As for the thieving bird, Bai Xiaochun decided that considering how he needed to avoid provoking Elder Zhou, it would be best to cast aside any thoughts of revenge.\u201cTrue men don\u2019t fight with birds!\u201d he told himself to make the decision easier to stomach. Sitting there in his log cabin, he produced several of the Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills he had concocted. Thinking back to how Elder Zhou had attacked him during the chase, his eyes gleamed with envy.\u201cFoundation Establishment cultivators are pretty incredible,\u201d he thought, sighing. \u201cHe almost made me cough up some blood. Thankfully I have my Undying Skin.\u201d With another glance at the Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills, he looked around furtively to make sure he was alone, and then produced the turtle-wok to perform some spirit enhancements.Soon, all of the pills had received threefold enhancements, and contained faint silver designs on their surfaces. Bai Xiaochun sighed again.\u201cIf only I had some fuel to make four-colored flame.\u201d Based on some discreet inquiries he\u2019d made earlier, he knew that the sect did have fuel to make four-colored flame. However, it wasn\u2019t very plentiful, and required an incredible amount of merit points to acquire. With the exception of certain unique medicines, or certain cultivation practices related to fire, it was rare to ever need four-colored flame.It was generally impossible to procure such fuel from the market at the bottom of the mountain; the only place it usually appeared was at auction, and even then, it wasn\u2019t commonly seen.\u201cI\u2019m running low on spirit tails too,\u201d he thought. After some more thought, he finally popped one of the Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills into his mouth and began to cultivate.Days passed. Bai Xiaochun practiced cultivation the entire time, occasionally consuming Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills as he did. His cultivation rapidly progressed until eventually, he ran out of pills.It happened late at night, when the clouds filled the sky obscuring the moon. Inside, rumbling could be heard, not within the cabin itself, but inside Bai Xiaochun\u2019s body.He began to shake as spiritual power built up inside of him, becoming a vast, dragon-like river that raged through all of his qi vessels.After completing a full cycle within him, his overall spiritual power expanded, surpassing his previous limit significantly. Filth oozed out from the pores all over his body, and an invigorating sense of buoyancy filled him. Enlivened, his eyes snapped open, and they shone like beacons in the dark of night.\u201cThe eighth level of Qi Condensation!\u201d Laughing heartily, he rushed out of his courtyard to wash off.He had been in the Spirit Stream Sect for years now, and although he was a lot tougher, he hadn\u2019t grown much physically, which left him feeling a bit depressed. In terms of his overall appearance, he was still just as pure and fair, and just as skinny.\u201cNow that I\u2019m in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, my controlling arts should be much more powerful.\u201d He waved his finger at a nearby boulder, which subsequently flew up into the air. In accord with Bai Xiaochun\u2019s will, it sped up, then slowed down as he experimented with both Lightness-in-Heaviness and Heaviness-in-Lightness.\u201cWhat I\u2019m most interested in, however, is what I accidentally unleashed when fighting Chen Heng\u2026 the Human Controlling Grand Magic!\u201d Eyes shining with a bright light, Bai Xiaochun experimented a bit more, but made little progress. After all, controlling inanimate objects and controlling people were two different things. Finally, he decided to abandon the idea for the time being.Later, back in his courtyard, he stood there contemplating the matter.\u201cIn the description of the Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning art, it says that once you cultivate all the way to the eighth level, you can utilize a mid-grade version of Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning.\u201dWith that, he performed a double-handed incantation gesture and waved his finger. Violet qi swirled about, and after two breaths of time passed, a large violet cauldron appeared in front of him.This time, it went much faster than before, at least twice as fast!Furthermore, it was larger than before, and it was much more corporeal. It was so clear that various magical symbols could be seen engraved on the surface of the cauldron.From the terrifying pressure that radiated from the large cauldron, Bai Xiaochun could tell that it was anything but ordinary.\u201cThat pressure is far more powerful than before!\u201dHe quickly probed his cultivation base; when he used Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning in the past, it drew significantly on his spiritual power, and would require a lot of cultivation to recover from afterward.But now, he still retained about seventy percent of his internal spiritual energy.\u201cI can use it three times in a row!\u201d Elated, he dispersed the violet cauldron and pulled out the Golden Crow Sword. As the golden light spread, he stepped onto the golden crow, and then flew out of the sect.Soon he was in the jungle outside of the sect. Up above, the sky rumbled with thunder, as though a storm were brewing. Sensing the impending danger of the storm, Bai Xiaochun quickly stopped in place and performed an incantation gesture, once again summoning the violet cauldron. Waving his finger, he sent it smashing into a nearby boulder.A boom echoed out, and the ground trembled, startling countless birds and animals. A crater appeared, with crevices snaking out from it for thirty meters in all directions.\u201cSo powerful!!\u201d he said with a gasp. After measuring himself up, he was sure that with his Undying Silver Skin and Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning, if he had to fight Chen Heng again, it wouldn\u2019t take much effort on his part to wipe him out.\u201cOr maybe not\u2026.\u201d he thought after a bit of hesitation. After all, fighting Chen Heng would still be quite dangerous, and would be best avoided. He could still lose his poor little life. The best thing would be to fight only enemies in the seventh level of Qi Condensation.\u201cWith the snap of a finger, I, Bai Xiaochun, could easily turn anyone from the first to the seventh level of Qi Condensation into ash!\u201d He flicked his sleeve proudly, but unfortunately, there was no nearby fence to stand on. He was forced to remain on the Golden Crow Sword, sticking his chin out, looking up at the clouds like a lonely hero. Finally, he turned the Golden Crow Sword around and headed back toward the sect.However, it was at this point that\u2026 countless lightning bolts formed overhead. Attracted by the Golden Crow Sword, they began to descend toward Bai Xiaochun like silver snakes\u2026.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes went wide, and moments later, agonized screams could be heard amidst the crash of thunder.Chapter 76: Eighth Level of Qi Condensation!\u2014Translator: Deathblade.

    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 77: AuctionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 77: AuctionSoon after, Bai Xiaochun hobbled back to Fragrant Cloud Peak, hair standing on end, face smudged with ash. Heart pounding with residual fear, he crawled back into his courtyard and thought back to the rain of lightning he had just passed through, and shivered. Then he swore an oath to never again fly on a sword through a thunderstorm.That wasn\u2019t flying, that was risking one\u2019s life!Back in his log cabin, he grimaced in pain for quite some time before composing himself. Sitting down cross-legged on his bed, he looked at the rain falling outside, and then slowly rotated his cultivation base.\u201cTier-2 spirit medicines are appropriate for the eighth level of Qi Condensation and lower. If I want to raise my cultivation base any further, I really need to concoct some tier-3 spirit medicine.\u201d Resting his chin on his hand, he pondered the matter.\u201cTier-3 spirit medicines are even harder to concoct. The only way to do it with confidence is to first be very familiar with numerous tier-2 spirit medicines. Without a stable foundation, the chances of success are small.\u201d With that, he opened his bag of holding and examined his current accumulation of resources. The result was a long sigh. Although he had collected quite a few gifts due to his status as a Prestige disciple, he had consumed a terrifying amount of ingredients in his pill-concocting efforts recently. The result was that his stores were running low.\u201cI can\u2019t keep going on this way,\u201d he said, bowing his head thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely run out! I\u2019m already a pretty incredible journeyman apothecary. Maybe I should try to sell some medicine.\u201dThat thought started to get him excited. By the next morning, the rain had stopped, and he left his residence to go to the market and ask some questions. After getting a clearer idea of the prices of various medicinal pills, he bought a huge batch of medicinal plants, and then went to the sect to buy more with merit points.Finally, he took another trip to the Medicine Concocting Pavilion to begin working.Although tier-2 medicinal pills would fetch a high price, they consumed a lot of ingredients. Furthermore, considering the way he concocted, they wouldn\u2019t be the best use of his time.Therefore, he chose to concoct some tier-1 medicines that he was more familiar with. Over the course of the following days, he produced three different types of spirit medicines, each batch of which produced eight or nine pills. He also made two sticks of spirit incense. With that accomplished, he headed back to the market.The south bank market wasn\u2019t very large. Other than a few shops set up by Inner Sect disciples and other senior members of the sect, most of the establishments were run by various cultivator clans from other parts of the Eastwood Continent.It was like a little town, bustling mostly with Outer Sect disciples from the three mountain peaks. Having been there on numerous occasions, Bai Xiaochun was quite familiar with the place. After finding the shop he was looking for, he entered and cleared his throat, whereupon a salesperson approached.\u201cCall the shop owner out,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said. \u201cIn addition to buying some ingredients, this time I want to sell some medicinal pills!\u201d With that, he sat down in a chair, smiling so broadly that his eyes turned into slits.A short time later, a middle-aged man wearing a long violet robe walked up. When he saw that it was Bai Xiaochun, he smiled.\u201cFellow Daoist Bai, I am your humble servant Sun Chen,\u201d he said, clasping hands. \u201cI\u2019ve heard many stories about you, Fellow Daoist Bai, but was always worried about disturbing your peace, so I never went to offer formal greetings. I truly regret that now.\u201d Beaming, Sun Chen sat down across from Bai Xiaochun. Well aware of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s high position in the sect, he had no desire to offend him. Furthermore, the fact that he was a Prestige disciple meant that the Sun Clan still wanted to get on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s good side, despite the hundred-year-prohibition set in place by the sect leader.Bai Xiaochun laughed heartily and then exchanged some pleasantries. Next, he pulled out three bottles of medicinal pills and two sticks of incense, which he placed on the table between them.Sticking his chin out, he asked, \u201cFellow Daoist Sun, how much do you think these are worth?\u201dSun Chen picked up the medicinal pills, and after examining them, seemed pleasantly surprised. Although they were low-grade tier-1 medicinal pills, they had an impurity level of only about eighty-one or eighty-two percent, placing them very close to the mid-grade level. The pills usually acquired by the shop tended to be low-grade pills with impurity levels of eighty-four or eighty-five percent.Looking up at Bai Xiaochun with shining eyes, he said, \u201cBrother Bai, your Dao of medicine is quite refined. We would love to purchase all of your spirit medicines. How about we offer you 120 spirit stones? What do you say?\u201dBai Xiaochun was instantly delighted. That price was almost four spirit stones per medicinal pill, which was just about the highest price possible for low-grade tier-1 medicinal pills.Actually, the production cost for such a pill was, on average, only about half a spirit stone.Thrilled, the two of them completed the transaction and then continued to chat a bit. Eventually they came to an agreement; as long as Bai Xiaochun continued to supply the shop with medicinal pills, he could acquire ingredients without handing over any spirit stones. In the end, Bai Xiaochun left feeling very pleased.More time passed. Months went by in a flash, during which time Bai Xiaochun continuously concocted tier-1 spirit medicines to sell in exchange for ingredients. He also spent time familiarizing himself with tier-2 spirit medicines.Gradually, he grew more and more adept.At the same time, his relationship with the Sun Clan\u2019s medicine shop grew more stable. The Sun Clan bought virtually all of his medicinal pills. One day during the course of doing business, Sun Chen took a few bottles of medicinal pills and handed some plant ingredients over to Bai Xiaochun. As they chatted, Sun Clan sighed and said, \u201cBrother Bai, considering your skill in medicine concocting, why don\u2019t you concoct some tier-2 spirit medicine? Every few years a hundred clans auction is held, and as of today, it\u2019s only about three months away. If you concocted some tier-2 spirit medicine, I could help you put some of it up for auction. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d get a great price.\u201dAfter their months of doing business together, Sun Chen had come to find that Bai Xiaochun was cheerful and charismatic, and quite the joy to interact with, which was why he was being so helpful.Bai Xiaochun had also heard of the hundred clans auction, which was arranged by roughly a hundred of the cultivator clans from the Eastwood Continent. There were three locations where the auctions would be held. One was in the north bank market, the second was the south bank market, and the third was in the largest city of cultivators on the continent, Eastwood City.Bai Xiaochun had been in the Spirit Stream Sect for several years already, and the last auction had been held around the time he had first joined the Outer Sect. Back then, he had been mostly focused on stealing spirit tail chickens, and hadn\u2019t been interested in auctions.His interest having been piqued, he asked a few questions about when exactly the south bank auction would be held, and then finally took his leave. After returning to the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, he sat down cross-legged to think for a while before finally making a decision.\u201cWhat Sun Chen said makes sense. Instead of selling a little bit here and there, I might as well take advantage of the situation to sell something really expensive. Afterward, I can purchase a whole bunch of ingredients.\u201d After considering things, he thought of some various tier-2 spirit medicines, and finally decided\u2026 to concoct the one he was most familiar with, the Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pill.Having made his decision, he went into seclusion at the Medicine Concocting Pavilion and began to work on concocting Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills. Two months went by. After exchanging all of the medicinal pills he could for ingredients, he was able to concoct three bottles of Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills, each one containing ten pills.He also ended up with one pill whose color was different from the other light violet pills. This pill was dark violet, and didn\u2019t have a very strong medicinal aroma, as if it refused to let such an aroma waft out from within it.When that particular medicinal pill had emerged, the pill furnace had shaken in a way that was clearly different than the previous times. It was even been accompanied by a burst of Earthflame.Upon closer examination of the pill, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes gleamed with excitement.\u201cMid-grade! I, Bai Xiaochun, have finally concocted a mid-grade spirit medicine!\u201cThere probably won\u2019t be very many mid-grade spirit medicines at the auction. However, if I really want to cause a stir, I\u2019ll have to do better than this. After all\u2026 this auction only happens once every few years. There will surely be plenty of rare items up for sale.\u201d After some thought, he gritted his teeth and then took out the turtle-wok to perform a spirit enhancement.After the threefold enhancement was completed, silver light glittered, and the spirit medicine was no longer mid-grade. It had broken all the way past superior-grade to be\u2026 premium-grade!This type of premium-grade pill was quite shocking, with an impurity level of only ten percent or so.Bai Xiaochun was very pleased. The Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pill resting in his hand was now so dark it was almost black. It had three spirit designs on its surface, which were faint but clearly visible; anyone who laid eyes on the pill would be able to tell that it was something extraordinary.Bai Xiaochun suddenly had the feeling that this pill was another tool he could use to become famous. Laughing proudly, he pulled out a little knife and carved a picture onto it\u2026 a lovely little turtle.\u201cLord Turtle will once again make an appearance!\u201d Bai Xiaochun rose to his feet in excitement and anticipation.He took his medicinal pills out of the sect, and returned two hours later in high spirits, looking very pleased with himself. He could still picture the shock on Sun Chen\u2019s face the moment he saw the three bottles of Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills. The moment he noticed that there was also a premium-grade spirit medicine which had received a threefold spirit enhancement, his jaw had nearly dropped to the floor in astonishment.\u201cOnly one more month to go until the auction,\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought, looking at the jade slip he held, which was his ticket to the auction itself.Throughout the following days, everyone was talking about the auction. Soon, the disciples of the three mountain peaks on the southern bank began to make various preparations, hoping to strike it lucky at the auction. The market also thrummed with activity.\u201cOne of my clanmates from the north bank said that in the last auction, a Yellow Springs Flame went up for sale, a legendary item! It was only a spark, but could still be considered a unique treasure. One of the disciples from the north bank bought it at an exorbitant price.\u201d\u201cThere should be tons of unique treasures up for sale at this hundred clans auction, including a lot of shocking medicinal pills. That\u2019s because the Outer Sect Chosen battles will be coming up. They only happen once every thirty years!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re probably right. The joint north and south bank Outer Sect Chosen battles are a grand occasion for the entire Spirit Stream Sect. It\u2019s too bad that the top ten from the south bank haven\u2019t been able to match up to the north bank for years now! I wonder if one of the south bank\u2019s top ten will be able to get revenge this year!?\u201dOver the following month, talk of the auction grew more and more common throughout the sect. Bai Xiaochun heard much of the talk, and noticed a lot of people discussing the joint north and south bank Outer Sect Chosen battles. However, he didn\u2019t pay much attention to such talk.Soon, the month had passed. One morning at dawn when Bai Xiaochun was meditating, his eyes suddenly opened, and he pulled a glowing jade slip out of his bag of holding.\u201cThe auction is going to start,\u201d he thought, eyes shining with anticipation. He quickly hurried out of his courtyard and raced down the mountain. Along the way, he passed quite a few Outer Sect disciples, until he noticed a few beams of light speeding by over head.He smacked his own forehead at the realization that he\u2019d forgotten about being able to fly. Quickly performing an incantation gesture, he summoned the Golden Crow Sword. Stepping onto the golden crow, he transformed into a beam of golden light that shot off into the distance.He soon reached the market. Head high and chest out, he entered the auction pavilion.It was a huge structure, with several thousand seats set up on the auction floor, as well as an open area behind the seats where a crowd of people stood, packed together tightly. As for Bai Xiaochun, he was whisked away by Sun Chen, who took him to a private room on the second floor, and then left.The room was relatively small, with a narrow balcony, beneath which was the main auction floor. The auction stage was also clearly visible.This was not Bai Xiaochun\u2019s first time being present for such a lively affair. Instead of behaving like the Foundation Establishment cultivators in the other private rooms, who stayed out of sight, Bai Xiaochun made sure to lean out of the balcony. Worried that people might not notice him, he began to clear his throat as loudly as possible.Soon, some people down below saw him, casting odd glances at him before turning away.Unfortunately, there were simply too many people present, so no matter how loudly he cleared his throat, the sound would only go so far. Off in the distance, he caught sight of Hou Xiaomei, as well as Zhou Xinqi and some of the other people he knew. However, they were too far away to notice him.Even after yelling at the top of his lungs, they didn\u2019t turn his way, and he started to get a bit depressed. Finally, he lost interest. In any case, sticking himself out of the balcony was a bit tiring\u2026. Furthermore, there was always the danger of accidentally falling\u2026. If that happened, then it would only take a day for everyone on the entire south bank to hear about it.Time passed, and more people showed up. After about an hour, the sound of a cauldron being struck rung out, and everything went quiet. Countless eyes were all fixed on the auction stage.Soon, a middle-aged man in a green garment appeared. Smiling, he stood there and greeted everyone with clasped hands.\u201cI am your humble servant Qian Song. I presume many of you Fellow Daoists are already familiar with me. I will be presiding over the auction today. The rules are the same as ever, all lots go to the highest bidder.\u201d Without any further ado, he waved his right hand, and a glowing door rose up on the auction stage.A young woman emerged, holding a platter, atop which was an oddly shaped rock formed of various metals.The rock glowed with garish, multicolored light that reflected within the excited, shocked eyes of the thousands of auction attendees.Bai Xiaochun looked closely at the rock but couldn\u2019t quite tell what it was. However, other people in the crowd seemed to know exactly what it was, and were already getting excited.When Qian Song spoke, his voice was soft, but he boosted it with his Foundation Establishment cultivation base, ensuring that it spread out for all to hear. \u201cLot one is a piece of Auric Ore. Minimum bid, 300 spirit stones. Bid increment is a minimum of 50 spirit stones!\u201d\u201c350 spirit stones!\u201d someone cried out.\u201c400!\u201d Almost as soon as the first bid came out, another topped it. Before long, the price reached 700 spirit stones, and the item was sold to a disciple from Violet Cauldron Peak.Bai Xiaochun looked at the piece of ore with wide eyes, trying to figure out why it could possibly be worth 700 spirit stones. Another thing he\u2019d noticed was that after the auction had begun, a spell formation had been activated which amplified the voices of anyone calling out bids.\u201cIt\u2019s just a piece of metal,\u201d he thought a bit sourly as he sat there watching.More items appeared and were sold. One of them was a green horn from a juvenile dragon, which had apparently been struck by lightning, leaving sparks of electricity coursing along its surface. It fetched a price of 8,000 spirit stones, which left Bai Xiaochun completely shaken.After the auction had been going for about an hour, Qian Song\u2019s voice rang out with the following words: \u201cThe next lot is a bottle of tier-2 spirit medicine. Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills, a total of ten. They are close to mid-grade, with an impurity level of eighty-one percent. Minimum price, 100 spirit stones. Bid increment is a minimum of 10 spirit stones.\u201dBai Xiaochun instantly perked up, and stared out at the auction floor in anticipation. Thinking nervously about how much he might make, he waited for someone to call out a bid.However, for some reason, the only thing that met his ears was silence. Even as his heart began to pound, someone called out an opening bid.\u201c110 spirit stones.\u201d The bidder was an Outer Sect disciple, and the amount bid was apparently all of his savings. After calling out the bid he stared around nervously.However, Bai Xiaochun was even more nervous than he was. That bottle of Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pills had cost him about 50 spirit stones to manufacture, and if he sold it at the market, would fetch a price of 150 or 160.At the moment, all he could do was scowl at the audience in astonishment.Just when Qian Song was about to strike down with the auction hammer, someone else called out another price. Then, more people jumped in. In the end, the price jumped all the way to 180 spirit stones.\u201c180 spirit stones isn\u2019t bad. That\u2019s about 20 higher than at the market.\u201d Sighing in relief, he wiped the sweat from his brow. The truth was, the price the bottle had fetched earned him a tidy profit, although it didn\u2019t come close to the value of some of the other precious items which had gone up for bid so far.Soon, his second bottle went up, and ended up selling for a slightly higher price, 200 spirit stones. Bai Xiaochun was very pleased.By the time the third bottle went up, the Qi Condensation disciples were getting very excited, and more people jumped in on the bidding. In the end, Bai Xiaochun was ecstatic; the final price reached 230 spirit stones.\u201cMore than 700 spirit stones! Now this is what I call an auction! I already have enough spirit stones to concoct a tier-3 spirit medicine.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was an easy person to please. His sour mood from before was completely gone, and he sat there happily waiting for the premium-grade spirit medicine to appear.\u201cConsidering the price the other bottles fetched, I think the premium-grade might get\u2026 300 spirit stones?\u201d After a bit of hesitation, he changed his mind.\u201c200 would be fine!\u201d He nodded confidently.Time passed. Bai Xiaochun sat there waiting until it was afternoon. There on the auction stage, Qian Song\u2019s expression suddenly turned a bit strange. Looking around at the audience, he cleared his throat.\u201cThe next lot is something a bit interesting\u2026. It\u2019s a tier-2 spirit medicine, also a Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pill. However\u2026 there\u2019s something different about it.\u201dBai Xiaochun sat there anxiously on the balcony, mind buzzing with nervousness.Chapter 77: Auction\u2014Translator: Deathblade.

    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 78: Are They Talking About Me?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPeople on the auction floor immediately got excited upon hearing Qian Song\u2019s announcement.The only ones who didn\u2019t care were the Inner Sect disciples whose cultivation bases were above the eighth level of Qi Condensation, who began to chat among themselves about other topics, or simply closed their eyes to rest.\u201cPlease take a moment to examine the pill first,\u201d Qian Song said with a dry cough. \u201cAfterward, I will reveal the price.\u201d It was at this point that a pretty young woman emerged from the glowing door, holding a wooden box in her hands.Excitement built as everyone craned their necks to try to get a look at exactly what type of Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pill this was that would cause such a strange expression to appear on Qian Song\u2019s face.Bai Xiaochun was getting more and more nervous, and began to breathe heavily as he looked over at the auction stage. A moment later, the pretty young woman lifted the lid off the box and pulled out a dark violet pill.The medicinal pill was especially conspicuous considering the fairness of her skin. It glowed with a soft light, and the three designs on its surface were especially noticeable. Also visible... was the little turtle etched next to the spirit designs.At first, silence prevailed. But then, a huge commotion broke out.\u201cA threefold spirit enhancement! Heavens! Are my eyes deceiving me?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s insane! It\u2019s actually a tier-2 spirit medicine with a threefold spirit enhancement! I can\u2019t believe somebody succeeded in doing such a thing!!\u201d\u201cThis is crazy! A spirit enhanced Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pill!!\u201dThe voices of the flabbergasted Outer Sect disciples rose up into a cacophony that filled the entire auction floor.\u201cDammit! Who actually did something like that? What a waste!\u201d\u201cA threefold spirit enhancement like that? What psycho had the inclination to do such a thing!?!?\u201dEven the Inner Sect disciples who had been ignoring things up to this point looked over in surprise. When they saw the spirit designs running across the surface of the medicinal pill, their eyes went wide, and they gasped. Many of them even shot to their feet.It must be stated that the success rate of spirit enhancement was not very high. A onefold enhancement was difficult enough, and a twofold enhancement was even harder. As for a threefold enhancement... it all depended on luck. Even grandmasters wouldn't dare to claim the ability to succeed at a threefold enhancement.In the Spirit Stream Sect, far too many people had destroyed magical items in the process of attempting threefold spirit enhancements, much to their heartache. Because of that, most people had a love-hate relationship with spirit enhancement; whenever people did manage to succeed, they would arouse the envy of their contemporaries.For a magical item to successfully receive a threefold spirit enhancement would make it more powerful to a shocking degree, and would make many people desire to acquire it. But now... everyone was astonished to find themselves looking at a medicinal pill which had received a threefold spirit enhancement!Furthermore, it was a tier-2 medicinal pill!If a gorgeous pattern were to develop on the wings of a butterfly, everyone would marvel at the spectacular beauty. But if such a design were to appear on the back of a pig... it could only be described as a huge waste!!Mixed emotions could be seen on the faces of the onlookers as numerous thoughts ran through their minds. Many of them even clenched their fists into balls, causing veins to bulge out on their hands and faces. The Inner Sect disciples from Violet Cauldron Peak were especially pained, considering that they studied spirit enhancement as part of their cultivation.\u201cWhat luck! Somebody actually managed to perform a spirit enhancement on a medicinal pill, and then brought it here to sell. Dammit! If I were that lucky, I would definitely have a spirit enhanced treasure!!\u201dEven the Foundation Establishment cultivators on the second floor were looking at the medicinal pill in front of them in shock.Bai Xiaochun sat on the balcony watching all of this happening, somewhat surprised. He looked blankly at the enraged crowd below, some of whom were turning red in the face. He suddenly had the feeling... that he might have gone too far.... He immediately put a look of righteous indignation onto his face and then pointed at the medicinal pill angrily.\u201cLoser!\u201d he shouted furiously. \u201cWhat loser made that pill?!\u201dOff in the distance, Sun Chen was smiling wryly. When he first saw the medicinal pill, he had experienced the same feeling most people in the audience were feeling right now. But then he saw the way Bai Xiaochun was acting off in the distance, and his jaw dropped. A little bit of sweat even dripped down the side of his face.However, it was at this point that someone in the crowd with sharp eyes happened to notice the little turtle etched into the side of the pill.\u201cEee? Why does that little turtle seem so familiar...?\u201d Almost as soon as the words left his mouth, others in the crowd began to look more closely at the pill. At first, they had all been so surprised by the three spirit designs that they didn't look at anything else. But now they all noticed the turtle etching.\u201cThat little turtle.... Hey, I remember! Back on Fragrant Cloud Peak, the first place spot on all of the stone steles at the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion is occupied by a little turtle!!\u201d\u201cThis turtle looks just like that one. The style is exactly the same. That... was etched by a person!\u201d\u201cThe person who concocted that pill, and then went to the insane length of performing a threefold spirit enhancement, was none other than the mysterious and unfathomable Chosen of Fragrant Cloud Peak, the little turtle!\u201dCries of excitement rang up. After all, many disciples in the audience were from Fragrant Cloud Peak, and once they saw the little turtle, they were struck with astonishment.More and more people caught sight of the turtle, and gasps rang out. People even began to rise to their feet. Although not much news about Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s little turtle had spread lately, he was incredibly famous. Everyone in the sect knew about him, and many people continued to speculate all the time about who exactly he was.However, no one had been able to solve the mystery. The little turtle was simply too mysterious, so mysterious that apparently no one knew his true identity. He liked to keep an extremely low profile, and was indifferent to the outside world, paying virtually no attention to it at all.But all of a sudden... he had made another appearance!Furthermore, he had chosen to completely shake the entire auction, and shock everyone who attended.Zhou Xinqi was there in the crowd, her eyes shining brightly as she looked at the medicinal pill. Her chest heaved, and various emotions coursed through her.\u201cSo, you finally show your face,\u201d she murmured to herself. \u201cA Chosen like you cannot remain hidden forever within the sea of people. You may want to remain out of sight, but your incredible talents have doomed you to be revealed, no matter how much you try to hide. I will find out who you are, one day!\u201d Zhou Xinqi had spent a lot of time secretly investigating the little turtle. For a time, she had suspected Bai Xiaochun, but soon decided that it couldn\u2019t be him, and made up her own version of who the little turtle was. He was a cold, proud man who would never taint his own name because of a desire to be famous.Zhou Xinqi actually wasn\u2019t the only one who had come to such a conclusion. Most people felt the same, even Hou Xiaomei. Of course, much of that was because of how much Bai Xiaochun himself had propagated stories about the little turtle.Many people had even analyzed why he used a turtle as his mark. The explanation was that he had a reserved personality, but also maintained lofty aspirations. Like turtles, his medicinal pills would survive for thousands of years into the future.Hou Xiaomei stood not too far off in the distance, her eyes wide with adoration. Because of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s urgings, she worshiped the little turtle more than anyone else in the sect. In fact, she\u2019d even found other disciples like herself, and had formed something of a club, which they called the Little Turtle League.\u201cWhat?! The little turtle!\u201d Hou Xiaomei nearly jumped up into the air in excitement as she pointed at the auction stage.The entire auction floor had devolved into chaos. Now, people no longer said even a single comment in anger or skepticism. Instead, profound expressions appeared on their faces.\u201cHe definitely pursues excellence to the extreme!\u201d\u201cA proud Chosen such as the little turtle would never perform a spirit enhancement on a medicinal pill just to sell it at auction. He seeks the quintessence of the Dao of medicine. He did it as a means of research, because of his incredible focus!\u201dEven the Inner Sect disciples who had been in such pain earlier were now heaving sighs and looking at each other in dismay. All of them had to admit they were incapable of pulling off a threefold spirit enhancement.\u201cNow I understand what type of Chosen he is. He\u2019s not insane, nor is he showing off. He has grand aspirations. He\u2019s completely focused! He wants his medicinal pills to reach the ultimate pinnacle!\u201d\u201cIncredible! Shocking! This level of focus, this level of willpower, this type of perfect pill... we can all strive to imitate him!\u201d\u201cA threefold spirit enhancement can raise an object\u2019s quality by three grades. That means... that this medicinal pill was originally mid-grade. The little turtle\u2019s skill in medicine concocting has already far surpassed my own. He definitely deserves his reputation!\u201d\u201cThat medicinal pill should be kept as souvenir! I must have it!\u201d The Inner Sect disciples\u2019 eyes shone with a bright light. Although the pill wasn\u2019t suitable for them to consume, it could fill them with inspiration.Looking at a pill like that made them feel as if they were looking at a Chosen who cared not for fame or fortune, who was completely focused, who strove only after the Dao of medicine.Seeing how quickly the conversation had changed, Bai Xiaochun, who had been joining along in the public outrage, suddenly stared around with wide eyes. After hearing what people were saying, his face began to turn red.\u201cAre they... are they talking about me...?\u201d he thought, trembling. He had never before realized how superior he was. Now that he suddenly saw the light, he had the urge to yell at the top of his lungs, to tell everyone around him that he was the famous Lord Turtle!However, it was at this point that Qian Song cleared his throat and smiled.\u201cAs all of you can see, this pill has great symbolic meaning. Minimum bid, 500 spirit stones. Bid increment is a minimum of 50 spirit stones!\u201dBai Xiaochun gasped when he heard the astronomical price. Most Outer Sect disciples couldn\u2019t even afford that many spirit stones.\u201c600 spirit stones!\u201d\u201c700 spirit stones! That pill contains the essence of the Dao of medicine! I must acquire it!\u201d\u201c800! Who dares to top me!?\u201d The Inner Sect disciples immediately began to call out prices, and soon everyone was in an uproar.Bids continued to be called out, and soon the price reached 1,500 spirit stones. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s throat was dry, and he was panting in disbelief.\u201cCrazy!\u201d he mouthed in excitement. \u201cThey\u2019re all crazy.... Wait, let\u2019s get a bit more crazy, people.... Come on!! Everybody join in!\u201d\u201c1,800 spirit stones.\u201d That bid came from Zhou Xinqi, causing numerous people to look over in her direction. Bai Xiaochun even began to cheer her on.The price had already reached the limit of what was possible for Inner Sect disciples to afford. Although none of them wished to let the pill go, they had no choice but to sigh. After all, Zhou Xinqi was already a Chosen in the Dao of medicine. Since she wanted the pill, none of the other disciples were willing to compete with her.Bai Xiaochun was very pleased with the price, and had to hold himself back from running over to Qian Song, grabbing the auction hammer, and banging it down to end the bidding. However, it was at this point that the stubborn and determined voice of young woman rang out, fiery as a pepper.\u201cI am Hou Xiaomei of the Hou Clan. I bid 3,000 spirit stones!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked over at Hou Xiaomei, eyes shining, and suddenly felt the desire to run over, hug her, give her three thousand thumbs up and tell her\u2026 \u201cGreat job!\u201dWhen the rest of the disciples on the auction floor heard that huge price coming out of Hou Xiaomei\u2019s mouth, the commotion instantly ceased, and jaws dropped. They looked over to find Hou Xiaomei standing there, hands on her hips, chest heaving, looking very fair and delicate. She was pretty, but had a proud look on her face, and looked like a blazing hot pepper.Sticking her chin out, she looked over at Zhou Xinqi with a look that said, I\u2019m from the Hou Clan, and I\u2019m not scared of anyone! Plus, I\u2019m rich!The overall effect wasn\u2019t off-putting, but rather, made her seem quite cute.Quite a few people broke out into smiles at the sight, whereas others were even more shocked than before.\u201c3,100 spirit stones!\u201d Zhou Xinqi said coolly, her expression growing a bit colder.\u201cThe little turtle is very important to me!\u201d Hou Xiaomei said. \u201cI don\u2019t care how expensive it is, any pill made by him must belong to me. Hmph! 4,000 spirit stones! I\u2019m from the Hou Clan, and I have plenty of money to go around!\u201d She especially emphasized the last sentence. Next to her, Hou Yunfei bowed his head in nervous embarrassment. He wasn\u2019t sure why his little sister worshipped the little turtle with such frenzied devotion\u2026.Zhou Xinqi\u2019s fans couldn\u2019t watch this go on, and many of them began to cry out that only a loser would spend so much money on a tier-2 spirit medicine.Hou Xiaomei wasn\u2019t too happy to hear such things. Sticking her chest out and planting her hands on her hips, she barked, \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of spirit stones, so you can just bite me!\u201dAs Bai Xiaochun watched the events unfold, he couldn\u2019t help but muse that he had made the right decision to pull Hou Xiaomei off the crooked path and onto the way of righteousness.Zhou Xinqi frowned. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t have that many spirit stones, and so finally, she had no choice but to give up.Hou Xiaomei was delighted that Zhou Xinqi didn\u2019t make any more bids. The truth was that she didn\u2019t have as many spirit stones as she had implied. She had only said so in front of so many people in the hopes that it would force her clan\u2019s patriarch to accommodate her.In the end, Hou Xiaomei was very pleased to have won the threefold spirit enhanced medicinal pill.Bai Xiaochun was also very pleased. Looking admiringly at Hou Xiaomei, he cleared his throat. In his opinion, considering how much she admired him, it would be improper not to tell her about his true identity.Having reached this conclusion, and seeing that the first day of the auction was coming to an end, he decided that now was the time to go out and proclaim his identity to the public.Meanwhile, backstage, various patriarchs from the cultivator clans were gathered, having been tasked with standing guard over the auction. One of them was a middle-aged man, who was currently coughing dryly as he looked around wryly at his fellow patriarchs.\u201cWell\u2026 my granddaughter sure is stubborn. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s made a bit of a fool of herself in front of all of you.\u201d With that, he bitterly produced a large sum of spirit stones which he put off to the side.\u201cWhat an innocent girl!\u201d The other patriarchs all laughed good-naturedly.The first day of the auction was over, and although there were more days to come, Bai Xiaochun had already sold his medicinal pills, so he didn\u2019t plan to return. He walked over to the entrance of the auction and stood there watching everyone filing out of the auction house.Virtually all of them were excitedly discussing the matter of the Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pill.Eventually, Bai Xiaochun caught sight of Zhou Xinqi. He wanted to go encourage her not to feel disheartened, but as soon as he took a step forward to head in her direction, she looked over and saw him coming. Without another word, she transformed into a beam of light that shot off into the distance.Bai Xiaochun stopped in place, feeling a bit depressed. But then he heard a voice coming from behind him.\u201cBig bro Xiaochun!\u201d It was Hou Xiaomei, who came bouncing over happily through the crowd, followed by Hou Yunfei, who was also smiling.Bai Xiaochun looked away from Zhou Xinqi and gave Hou Xiaomei a smile of praise. Looking very much like a member of the senior generation, he patted her on the head.\u201cHey there, chaste little sister. I have to say, you did a great job. The way you won that final item in the auction was very domineering!\u201dHou Xiaomei\u2019s face turned bright red. Seeming to recall something all of a sudden, she pulled out the Violet Qi Spirit Ascension Pill.\u201cBig bro Xiaochun, look! This medicinal pill was concocted by the little turtle. Would you like it? Here, take it. Didn\u2019t you say before that you also adore the little turtle? I bought this pill just for you!\u201d Anyone who saw the expression on her face would be moved. Holding out the pill to Bai Xiaochun, she looked at him with keen anticipation, as if he were the only thing that existed in the world.When Hou Yunfei saw this, his gaze softened, and he smiled, but didn\u2019t say anything.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s jaw dropped. Never could he have imagined that Hou Xiaomei\u2019s goal in winning the medicinal pill was to give it to him. It was very moving. Seeing that they were surrounded by quite a few people, he took a deep breath and put a solemn expression on his face.Eyes filling with determination, he clasped his hands behind his back like a powerful hero, a posture he had long since become very familiar with adopting.\u201cXiaomei,\u201d he said, \u201cI need to reveal a very big secret!\u201dHou Xiaomei looked shocked, as did Hou Yunfei.\u201cWhat secret?\u201d Hou Xiaomei asked curiously.Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat loudly, stuck out his chin, and swished his sleeve.\u201cI, Bai Xiaochun, am he who shocks ghosts and gods, the preeminently famous, mysterious and unfathomable\u2026 the great and mighty\u2026 Lord Turtle!!\u201d He then threw his head back and laughed uproariously. The words he had just uttered had been kept locked inside of him for far too long, and it felt wonderful to speak them out in the open, especially considering he was speaking them to the person who adored him the most, Hou Xiaomei, and in front of such a large audience of onlookers.Most importantly, it wasn\u2019t proper to allow the person who worshipped him the most fervently to be kept in the dark, especially when her idol was standing directly in front of her! Bai Xiaochun stared up at the clouds above, looking very lonely. However, his ears twitched a bit as he waited to hear the shocked reactions of Hou Xiaomei and the rest of the crowd.He was already formulating the words he would use in response to the impending commotion.However, after a very long moment passed, not a sound could be heard. Everything was completely silent. Surprised, Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but look back from the clouds toward Hou Xiaomei and Hou Yunfei.Hou Xiaomei stood there with wide eyes, and Hou Yunfei was similarly shocked. As they stared mutely at Bai Xiaochun, the surrounding disciples looked on with strange expressions on their faces.\u201cThe little turtle is indifferent to worldly affairs,\u201d someone said, \u201clike a cloud floating in the sky. Now Sect Uncle Bai is calling himself the little turtle? Yeah right\u2026. Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201dAn unsightly expression could be seen on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face, and he took a deep breath in preparation to make an explanation.\u201cXiaochun, are you alright?\u201d Hou Yunfei asked. Worried, he patted Bai Xiaochun on the head.\u201cI really am the little turtle!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said anxiously.\u201cOh?\u201d Hou Yunfei replied, a strange expression on his face. He quickly nodded. \u201cSure, sure. You\u2019re the little turtle\u2026.\u201dAt this point, Hou Xiaomei gazed at Big bro Xiaochun and softly said, \u201cBig bro Xiaochun, you told me before that the little turtle is like a cloud in the sky, someone who doesn\u2019t care at all about worldly matters\u2026. Actually, in my heart, you\u2019re just as important as he is. You don\u2019t need to pretend to be him\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut I really am the\u2013\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, Hou Yunfei looked at him somberly and clasped his arm. \u201cXiaochun, we believe you!\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cI really\u2013\u201dBefore he could finish, Hou Yunfei\u2019s expression turned more serious. \u201cXiaochun. We really believe you!\u201d\u201cI\u2013\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes began to glaze over as a feeling of disheartenment filled him. No matter how he tried to explain the situation, it wouldn\u2019t do any good. Things were going completely different than he\u2019d imagined. Dejected, he turned slowly and trudged away, somehow returning to the sect.Back in his courtyard, he stared blankly up into the sky, an expression of grief on his face.\u201cBut I really am Lord Turtle\u2026.\u201d he murmured, feeling very maligned. He had long dreamed about proclaiming his identity publicly, but now that dream was in tatters.After a while, he came to the conclusion that the problem lay in the fact that he had worked so hard over the years to inflate the image of the little turtle in the minds of the people\u2026. To them, the little turtle was a completely proud and extraordinary individual.More precisely, thanks to the tireless efforts of Hou Xiaomei, the little turtle had already been turned into something of a deity\u2026.After a while, Bai Xiaochun begrudgingly went to find Xu Baocai to explain the truth. Afterward, Xu Baocai stared at him blankly for a moment\u2026 and then nodded repeatedly and said that he believed him.Bai Xiaochun scowled miserably all the way back to his courtyard, where he once again stood there feeling empty.A few days later, Sun Chen came to visit. Bai Xiaochun immediately perked up. Suddenly, he had hope, hope that Sun Chen would remember who it was that had delivered the medicinal pill up to be auctioned off.However, before he could even say anything, Sun Chen handed over the spirit stones, then clasped hands and bowed deeply. Expression solemn, he said, \u201cBrother Bai, I\u2019m not sure which honored Chosen concocted that pill. The Sun Clan patriarch was quite shocked by the matter. We know that the only way to contact that Chosen is via you, Brother Bai. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have been the one to deliver his medicinal pill.\u201cBrother Bai, could you please pass word to him that the Sun Clan hopes to have a longstanding friendship with him? If he needs any help selling medicinal pills in the future, we will use all our power to help him!\u201cAnother thing, Brother Bai. Could you please pass word to the Chosen that I understand he doesn\u2019t seek fame and fortune, and purposely avoids big commotions? He is like a cloud in the sky, seeking perfection in the Dao of medicine. A person like him will surely reach incredible heights in the future. Therefore, our Sun Clan would be happy to handle all matters relating to the outside world for him.\u201d Sun Chen clasped hands and bowed deeply once again. When he looked up, he noticed that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression was completely blank. When that expression didn\u2019t change, Sun Chen once again clasped hands, bowed, and then took his leave.Inwardly, he sighed as he thought about how high Bai Xiaochun\u2019s position was in the Spirit Stream Sect, and how the mysterious, unfathomable figure that no one else knew, actually had dealings with him.From the very beginning, he had never even considered that Bai Xiaochun might actually be the little turtle. Their personalities were too different. After all, it wasn\u2019t just Spirit Stream Sect disciples who knew about the little turtle. The cultivator clans on the outside were also aware of him. All of them had performed their own investigations, and had come to similar conclusions as Zhou Xinqi.By the time Bai Xiaochun regained his composure, the moon hung high in the sky. Sighing deeply, he leapt up onto the bamboo fence that surrounded his courtyard. Clasping his hands behind his back, he looked up at the starry sky, his long black hair swaying in the wind and his robes rustling.\u201cI never imagined that deep within me was the desire to shun worldly matters. I am like a cloud which floats in the sky. Ai. I shouldn\u2019t have kept things hidden so well. Sometimes, being superior really is truly lonely.\u201d As he stood there in the moonlight, he flicked his sleeve, and truly looked like a lonely hero.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 80: The Talents of Big Fatty ZhangPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80: The Talents of Big Fatty ZhangNow that he had plenty of spirit stones, Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t want to worry about the issue of the little turtle any more. His heart had already been pierced a thousand times over by what had occurred. Now, the only thing left to do was go to the Medicine Concocting Pavilion and heal by immersing himself in pill concocting.By this point, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s ability to concoct tier-2 spirit medicine had been refined to perfection. His success rate was shockingly high, and he was already beginning to work on tier-3 medicine.Rumbling sounds filled his workstation as he went about his work. On one occasion, something completely unexpected occurred when the pill furnace rocketed into the air and slammed into the wall before exploding, leaving a small crater behind.However, that was almost nothing compared to the time when an exploding pill furnace sent out smoke that not even the workshop\u2019s protective spell formation could stop. It filled nearly half of the Medicine Concocting Pavilion, causing everyone inside to run out, coughing and cursing the entire time.Shocked, Bai Xiaochun also ran out in similar fashion, and in the end, no one was completely sure who had caused the entire disaster.Feeling quite frustrated, Bai Xiaochun carefully returned to his workstation and began to work on another batch of tier-3 spirit medicine. Gradually, a strange expression appeared on his face as he realized he often tended to produce bizarre spirit medicines. For example, there was the time he created the medicine which had attracted hordes of ants. And then there was his Aphrodisiac Pill\u2026.The truth was, all of the strange pills he concocted were all terrifying.\u201cCould it be because I refuse to use a set medicine formula in my concocting? Every time I do my work, I follow my instincts, and that\u2019s what leads to the strange transformations? Or maybe I\u2019m just so naturally talented that God is jealous and intentionally causes problems for me?\u201d Currently, a few dozen brightly colored medicinal pills were laid out in front of Bai Xiaochun, which he looked down at, frowning.None of them were spherical. Some were cube-shaped, and others looked like malformed lumps of clay. Clearly, they were not ordinary spirit medicines, and yet, each and every one let off a strong medicinal aroma\u2026.Even if Bai Xiaochun were a hundred times braver than he was, he wouldn\u2019t dare to personally consume any of them. It was impossible to say what unimaginable effects they might produce.\u201cI want to achieve the ultimate pinnacle in the Dao of medicine. I am like a cloud in the sky, floating about effortlessly, ignoring the material world. The Dao of medicine is a path strewn with obstacles, so I must not fear. I just have to endure. That is the new me, a new Bai Xiaochun.\u201d With that, determination appeared on his face. Looking as if he were searching for the deeper truths in life, he put the pills away and once again began his concocting work.He spent nearly half a day on the next batch. Unfortunately, he had reached the point where there were few types of medicine that he could continue to work on. It was simply too dangerous. His pill furnace would explode every time, leaving significant damage in its wake. Scowling, he paid some spirit stones in compensation, at which time he was politely asked to leave the Medicine Concocting Pavilion.He was just about to call upon his status as the Junior Brother of the sect leader and demand to be allowed to stay, when he realized that Big Fatty Zhang had messaged him via jade slip. Apparently he\u2019d come to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s residence looking for him, and was wondering where he\u2019d gone off to.Seeing that Big Fatty Zhang had come to visit, Bai Xiaochun left the Medicine Concocting Pavilion. Sighing, he began to walk down one of the narrow mountain paths.\u201cIf I want to pursue the Dao of medicine to the pinnacle, then I will surely face obstacles along the way. I, Bai Xiaochun, am like a floating cloud. I will not surrender!\u201d Sticking his chest out and raising his head, he walked forward for a bit until he realized that something seemed off. At this time of day, the sect was usually a busy place. But right now, Fragrant Cloud Peak was very quiet. Looking around, he noticed that not a single disciple of the sixth level of Qi Condensation or higher could be seen. Everyone present was of the fifth level or lower.Shocked, he hurried back to his residence. Even as he approached from a distance, he saw a tall, skinny young man pacing back and forth excitedly in front of the main gate.That young man was none other than Big Fatty Zhang, who had lost a significant amount of weight.\u201cEldest Brother,\u201d Bai Xiaochun exclaimed in greeting, hurrying forward.\u201cNinth Junior Brother!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang replied, turning to look at Bai Xiaochun and laughing loudly. Big Fatty Zhang didn\u2019t care at all that Bai Xiaochun was now the Junior Brother of the sect leader. To Big Fatty Zhang, he was still his little Junior Brother.Bai Xiaochun dragged him into the courtyard, where they sat down to chat. Curious, Bai Xiaochun said, \u201cEldest Brother, you hardly ever come to visit. What brought you over? Is there something you need my help with? Just say the word!\u201dBai Xiaochun had long since come to view Big Fatty Zhang as a true older brother. Whenever he thought back to their days together in the Ovens, he was always left with a warm feeling.Big Fatty Zhang cleared his throat, but was unable to prevent the excitement and pride from showing on his face. Looking over, he slapped himself proudly on the chest. Back in the Ovens, it would have resulted in the sound of jiggling flesh, but now, only the creaking of bones could be heard. Even still, Big Fatty Zhang seemed enlivened.\u201cNinth Junior Brother, I have a huge secret to tell you!\u201dAs soon as Bai Xiaochun heard that a huge secret was involved, his eyes went wide, and he began to pay rapt attention.Sounding very lofty, Big Fatty Zhang went on to say, \u201cFrom now on, I, Big Fatty Zhang, am definitely going to be famous in the Spirit Stream Sect. Everyone will know my name. Tons of disciples will be trying to get on my good side. In fact, even the Foundation Establishment seniors will probably treat me with the utmost respect.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, looking surprised. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you also the little turtle?\u201dGlowing with exuberation, Big Fatty Zhang took a deep breath and lowered his voice. \u201cLittle turtle? Pshh. Ninth Junior Brother, you know that my Master is the Peak Lord of Violet Cauldron Peak, Xu Meixiang, right?\u201dBai Xiaochun nodded. He had known who Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s master was for some time, and also knew that she was the reason he had lost so much weight. She didn\u2019t like fat people, although that had also led Bai Xiaochun to consider some other strange possibilities regarding the situation.\u201cDo you know what my Master is best at?\u201d Big Fatty Zhang continued. \u201cSpirit enhancement! And do you know what I\u2019m studying from my Master? Spirit enhancement!\u201cHahaha! I, Big Fatty Zhang, happen to be blessed with incredible natural talent when it comes to spirit enhancement. My talent is so extraordinary that even my Master was completely shocked, and praised me to no end! Today, she actually said that it would only be a few more years before I\u2019m the number one grandmaster of spirit enhancement in the entire Spirit Stream Sect!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang rose to his feet, looking excitedly up into the sky, boiling with excitement. It was as if he were the most important being in existence.Bai Xiaochun blinked. Seeing Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s mighty pose, he quickly plastered an adoring expression on his face and exclaimed, \u201cSpirit enhancement?!\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s reaction made Big Fatty Zhang even happier. Slapping his shoulder, he said, \u201cNinth Junior Brother, from here on out, lots of people are going to be asking me to do spirit enhancements. If I don\u2019t like them, I\u2019ll refuse no matter what. If I do like them, then I\u2019ll charge them an arm and a leg! But you and Third Fatty are both from the Ovens. For the rest of my life, I won\u2019t charge you a single spirit stone. We\u2019re family, so as long as you provide the ingredients, I\u2019ll perform spirit enhancements for you for free!\u201dBig Fatty Zhang seemed high-spirited and full of mettle. From the moment he arrived at Violet Cauldron Peak, he had felt suppressed, but now that he knew he had a talent for spirit enhancement, he was elated. This was actually the first time he had ever come to visit Bai Xiaochun.\u201cElder Brother, you\u2019re incredible!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun exclaimed, looking ecstatic.\u201cCome, come,\u201d said Big Fatty Zhang. \u201cGive me something, anything. I\u2019ll do a onefold enhancement right here. With one of my weapons, you\u2019ll definitely get into the south bank\u2019s top ten during the qualifying rounds a few months from now. Then you can represent the south bank to fight the north bank in the Chosen battles!\u201d\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun blinked a few times. Seeing how excited Big Fatty Zhang was, he fished around in his bag of holding for a bit, and then pulled out one of the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s ordinary flying swords, of which he had a few. He quickly handed it over to Big Fatty Zhang.Big Fatty Zhang took a deep breath and then slapped his bag of holding, causing a few pieces of ore to fly out, which then floated around the sword.Then he closed his eyes, and unleashed the explosive power of his cultivation base. Although his cultivation base couldn\u2019t quite match up to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s, he was already in the great circle of the sixth level of Qi Condensation. His hair whipped about as he waved his left hand, causing silver light to shine out.As soon as the light appeared, a wind sprang up, and the entire area seemed to fill with fluctuations of spiritual energy. The energy streamed toward the pieces of ore, which filtered the energy before it passed on toward Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s left hand. At the same time, the pieces of ore began to melt. In a short time, they were already half gone.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered. This was his first time ever watching as someone performed a spirit enhancement, and the process was very different than when he used the turtle-wok. Apparently, the spirit enhancer would communicate directly with heaven and earth, and then filter its explosive power through the ore to soften it.Soon, Big Fatty Zhang began to shake. After enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn, he took a deep breath, and his eyes snapped open. Then, blinding silver light shot out from his hand to sweep over the sword.\u201cSpirit Actuation!\u201dThe air seemed to vibrate as the silver light shooting out from Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s hand bored into the flying sword. In the blink of an eye, the entire sword had turned silver.The sight was shocking to say the least, and Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but gasp.Panting, Big Fatty Zhang handed the flying sword over to Bai Xiaochun.\u201cTake it,\u201d he said, his voice brimming with confidence. \u201cThe sword\u2019s spirit has already been actuated. If you pour some more spiritual power into it to do a spirit test, the silver designs should appear!\u201d With that, he mopped the sweat off of his forehead.Bai Xiaochun took the flying sword and then excitedly poured some spiritual power into it. Instantly, cracking sounds could be heard as silver lines appeared on the surface of the sword. Moments later though, they faded away, and then cracks began to spread out, as if the sword couldn\u2019t contain the energy of heaven and earth which had been imbued into it. A moment later, it had transformed into nothing but a lump of slag.\u201cHuh?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, looking surprised. Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s jaw dropped, and the two of them exchanged glances.Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat, and was just about to say that it had been a low quality sword to begin with, when Big Fatty Zhang grabbed it and looked it over with wide eyes. After a moment, he stamped his foot angrily.\u201cI made a mistake. I didn\u2019t control the fusion with the spirit iron. The energy of heaven and earth was a bit too volatile. Ah, it doesn\u2019t matter. Alright Ninth Junior Brother, give me another flying sword, I\u2019ll try again.\u201d Big Fatty Zhang stared at Bai Xiaochun with bloodshot eyes.Bai Xiaochun produced another flying sword, whereupon Big Fatty Zhang took a deep breath. Expression very serious, he went through the process again, until the sword glowed with silver light. Then he handed it back to Bai Xiaochun.\u201cWhy don\u2019t\u2026 why don\u2019t you do the test, Eldest Brother?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said hesitantly.Voice solemn, Big Fatty Zhang said, \u201cThe first major rule of spirit enhancement is that unless the object belongs to the spirit enhancer, then he must not do the spirit test himself! It\u2019s a set rule that I can\u2019t violate. If I break the taboo, it will lead to endless troubles.\u201dSeeing how determined Big Fatty Zhang was, Bai Xiaochun nervously took the sword. He truly wanted it to work this time, otherwise it would be a significant blow to Big Fatty Zhang.After a moment of thought, he said, \u201cHm\u2026 Eldest Brother, why don\u2019t you wait here for a moment. I\u2019ll go to into my room to do the test. I think I put too much thought into it before and got too nervous.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, after hearing Bai Xiaochun\u2019s suggestions, he realized that it made sense, and nodded in agreement.Clearing his throat, he tried to pretend that he wasn\u2019t nervous at all. \u201cOf course. As my Master said, I shouldn\u2019t be there to see whether the enhancement succeeds or not. Ninth Junior Brother, hurry inside and try out the spirit test.\u201dBai Xiaochun turned and hurried inside. Frowning, he looked down at the flying sword. Worried about Big Fatty Zhang getting disappointed, he didn\u2019t attempt any test, but instead, performed an incantation gesture and pointed out, causing the turtle-wok to appear.\u201cAi. Eldest Brother has been under too much pressure from the very beginning. He\u2019s finally got some confidence back, so I can\u2019t let him leave disappointed. I wonder if using the turtle-wok will make the enhancement of this flying sword a success.\u201d Muttering to himself, he started a one-colored flame and then threw the untested flying sword into the wok.Silver light glittered brightly, after which he put the turtle-wok away. Gritting his teeth, he poured some of his spiritual energy into the sword, whereupon the silver light condensed into a single silver design.\u201cIt worked!\u201d he thought, although he wasn\u2019t sure whether it was because of what Big Fatty Zhang had done, or whether it was because of his own work. He quickly pushed the door open and rushed out. \u201cEldest Brother! It worked. It worked! You\u2019re so awesome, Eldest Brother!\u201dBig Fatty Zhang had been standing there nervously in the courtyard, wondering what the result would be. As soon as he saw Bai Xiaochun, a tremor ran through him. Then he saw the silver design on the flying sword. Slapping his thigh, he threw his head back and laughed loudly.\u201cWell, how did it turn out? It\u2019s just like I said. I didn\u2019t control the power last time. Back on Violet Cauldron Peak, I successfully enhanced three weapons already. Even my Master couldn\u2019t help but praise my talent. And here I did it again, Ninth Junior Brother!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang excitedly grabbed the sword from Bai Xiaochun to look at it.Bai Xiaochun stood off to the side, looking admiringly at Big Fatty Zhang. Seeing Big Fatty Zhang look so excited, he sighed in contentment.\u201cAlright, your Elder Brother is in a good mood now. I\u2019m going to enhance it once more. This sword is going to have a twofold spirit enhancement!\u201dBai Xiaochun had the feeling that such an attempt wasn\u2019t a very good idea. If he recalled correctly, there were a lot of sect rules and taboos regarding spirit enhancement. \u201cEldest Brother, why don\u2019t we try that some other time\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang said decisively. Holding the sword in hand, he began to concentrate and build up energy.This second attempt at spirit enhancement was clearly much more difficult, and he had to use all of the ores he possessed. He began to tremble, and even consumed some medicinal pills before finally managing to draw upon enough of the energy of heaven and earth to begin the process. When he poured the energy into the sword, dazzling silver light shone out, after which Big Fatty Zhang sat down heavily onto the ground, panting.However, his eyes shone with excitement as he handed the sword to Bai Xiaochun.\u201cGo ahead and test it!\u201dBai Xiaochun frowned as he took the sword. However, before he could test it, Big Fatty Zhang reached out and grabbed his hand.\u201cDon\u2019t test it here,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cRemember, Ninth Junior Brother, the most important part of the spirit testing process is the feeling you have. When the moment feels right, it\u2019s like having the assistance of the gods. Since you succeeded in your room last time, that\u2019s where you should test it this time!\u201dBai Xiaochun blinked a few times at how much Big Fatty Zhang seemed to know about spirit enhancement. Nodding, he trotted back to his room thoughtfully.\u201cEldest Brother might actually be really good at spirit enhancement. It\u2019s hard to say. Just now, he seemed to have succeeded, even without any help from my turtle-wok.\u201d Having reached this point in his train of thought, he decided not to put the flying sword into the turtle-wok. Instead, he simply poured some spiritual power directly into the sword.In the blink of an eye, silver light flashed. But then, it rapidly dimmed. Cracking sounds rang out, and the sword was reduced to useless slag.Even as Bai Xiaochun frowned anxiously, he could hear Big Fatty Zhang talking outside.\u201cNinth Junior Brother, I just saw some silver light. What happened. Did it succeed?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I didn\u2019t test it yet,\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied quickly. \u201cLet me do it now\u2026.\u201dBig Fatty Zhang stood there quietly outside, bitter nervousness written across his face. He was no idiot, and was quite certain that he\u2019d seen silver light shining out of the window of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s log cabin moments before.Sighing, he assumed that Bai Xiaochun simply didn\u2019t want to admit that it had been a failure. Taking a deep breath, he called out, \u201cI know that you performed the test, Ninth Junior Brother. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll just take my leave now.\u201dUpon arriving, Big Fatty Zhang had been bursting with excitement, but the blow he had just received left him sinking into despondency.He was aware that he had acted rashly. According to his Master, spirit enhancement was a very mysterious magical technique, and to achieve a perfect success rate with it was impossible. Furthermore, in the cultivation world, there was a strange phenomenon. Apparently\u2026 people who succeeded once would find it easier to succeed in the future, whereas people who failed would have the opposite experience.It sounded strange, but the truth was that it came down to the power of will. It was a mysterious thing, and the more confidence one possessed, the more likely one was to succeed.When it came to the world of spirit enhancement, there were two main techniques that could be cultivated. One was the orthodox method, in which the spirit enhancer was responsible for only the initial spirit enhancement. He would not personally perform the spirit test. Instead, the object would be given to the owner, who would perform the spirit test out of the spirit enhancer\u2019s presence.That way, success or failure wouldn\u2019t affect the mental state of the spirit enhancer. Without having been corrupted by the sight of the result, the spirit enhancer would be able to forget about the matter, and maintain a calm heart.However, there was another, more extreme method that was cultivated. It was called the Will-Spirit Grand Magic. It focused on the profound and mysterious power of will. In that method, the spirit enhancer would take great care to watch the outcome of the spirit enhancement. That way, the more successes they experienced, the more shocking their spirit enhancement abilities would become. It was an extreme method, and failure could have a very extreme negative impact on the spirit enhancer, even to the point of ruining their talents altogether.Even still, quite a few people attempted to use that method. Even Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s Master Xu Meixiang had to admit that if someone cultivated such an extreme method of spirit enhancement, they could achieve heaven-defying results. Their power of will, and their self-confidence, would achieve monumentally spectacular results.The Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s sect-protecting treasure, the Heavenhorn Sword, which had received a tenfold spirit enhancement, had been produced by just such an eccentric spirit enhancer, thousands of years in the past.Big Fatty Zhang smiled bitterly. He well understood that on Violet Cauldron Peak, the orthodox method of cultivation was preferred. By allowing himself to be overcome by excitement, he had made a huge mistake. The calmness in his heart had been disturbed, and it would take quite some time to recover.Bai Xiaochun could see Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s dejected posture through the window. Unwilling to allow him to be so disappointed, he gritted his teeth and produced an identical flying sword from within his bag of holding. Then he pulled out the turtle-wok and quickly performed a twofold spirit enhancement.By that point, the bitter Big Fatty Zhang had placed his hand onto the gate of the courtyard and was about to leave. All of a sudden, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s elated voice rang out.\u201cEldest Brother, it worked!!\u201d The door of the log cabin slammed open as Bai Xiaochun rushed out, overjoyed, holding a flying sword with two silver designs visible on its surface.\u201cReally?!\u201d A tremor ran through Big Fatty Zhang as he spun to look at the flying sword. Then he began to shake, a look of both excitement and disbelief growing in his eyes.\u201cHahaha! I really am a Chosen among spirit enhancers. A twofold spirit enhancement! I can\u2019t believe it! I succeeded!!\u2019He wrapped Bai Xiaochun up into a bear hug, tears of joy streaming down his face. The truth was that his latent talent was only average; if it weren\u2019t for the deep connections between his family and his Master, he would never have been admitted into the Spirit Stream Sect.It was only because of the precious materials back in the Ovens that he\u2019d been able to cultivate to the great circle of the third level of Qi Condensation. After joining the Outer Sect, he had no such precious materials, and thus found cultivation to be very difficult. He could only watch as Third Fatty Hei and Bai Xiaochun both surpassed him, and although he was happy for them, he was very disappointed in himself.Now that he turned out to be talented in spirit enhancement, the joy he felt was unimaginable. He suddenly felt useful. Filled with excitement, he threw his head back and laughed loudly, feeling the confidence wash through him. As it did, a strange power seemed to build up\u2026 which was none other than the intangible power of will.Spirit enhancement was an extreme path to follow; the more you succeeded, the more confidence you had. The stronger your power of will, the more you would succeed!Perhaps the mere belief that success was possible would help one to climb the steps of success, and breed that most mysterious power of will.Big Fatty Zhang left excitedly, holding his head proudly. Bai Xiaochun watched him go, then stood there in his courtyard wondering if he\u2019d done the right thing. In the end, he decided that as long as Big Fatty Zhang was happy, then he couldn\u2019t be in the wrong.A few days after Big Fatty Zhang left, Bai Xiaochun got some new information from Xu Baocai. Apparently, the reason why fewer people could be seen on Fragrant Cloud Peak was that all of the disciples from the sixth level of Qi Condensation and higher had gone into secluded meditation, hoping to break through to the eighth level in preparation for the Chosen battles, which happened only once every thirty years!The joint north and south bank Chosen battles were only about three months away, and would be the focus of attention of the entire Spirit Stream Sect. Throughout the Eastwood Continent, the cultivator clans and other small sects would also be paying close attention to the results.During the Chosen battles, Outer Sect Chosen from both the north and south banks would fight each other in an attempt to claim the top ten spots. All of the top male and female disciples would rise up like dragons and phoenixes, hoping to be promoted into the Inner Sect. Whether in terms of personal fame or the approval of the sect, disciples who ascended to the Inner Sect in this fashion were viewed completely differently than other disciples.Every thirty years, the top ten Chosen of the generation would always move on to greater glory. They were the outstanding talents, famous and revered far and near. Even other sects with status similar to the Spirit Stream Sect would acknowledge them.Anyone who could be ranked in the top ten in the Chosen battles would also receive handsome compensation from the sect. Word had it that the prize in merit points reached into the tens of thousands, not to mention the other precious materials that would be given out. Furthermore, there was also the chance to enter the sect\u2019s arcane pocket realm.Everyone was moved by the possibilities at hand.Beyond all that, the best of the best would have the chance to pursue a spot in the legendary Legacy Echelon. One requirement was to be in the top ten of the Chosen battles, which was in turn another motivating factor to all disciples.Before the Chosen battles, of course, were the qualifying rounds. Both the north and south banks would have their own qualifying rounds, during which they would select the ten best disciples to move on to the final Chosen battles.The cultivation base requirement was set at the eighth level of Qi Condensation. Only disciples of that level could participate. There were two main requirements to enter the Inner Sect: first, to be in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and second, to pass a trial by fire. Normally speaking, there were a variety of trials by fire which could be attempted to get into the Inner Sect. However, the Chosen battles which occurred every thirty years were the most difficult of them all, and also the most watched in all the sect!Of the numerous Outer Sect disciples who made the attempt, most would not be promoted. Only those who made it into the top hundred in the qualifying round would get into the Inner Sect. As for the top ten, they qualified to participate in the Chosen battles for the entire Spirit Stream Sect.Shangguan Tianyou, Lu Tianlei, and Zhou Xinqi were all people who wanted to get into the south bank\u2019s top ten, and then fight with the Chosen from the north bank. If they could become Inner Sect disciples in such a way, then they would have a shot at eventually reaching the Legacy Echelon.\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In all of the Outer Sect Chosen battles which had been held, the majority of the final top ten were north bank disciples. The south bank had never been able to achieve dominance, much less take the first place spot, which went to the north bank each and every time.One reason was that the north bank had four mountain peaks, while the south bank only had three. More than a thousand years ago, things had been different. Whether it was in terms of spirit enhancement or medicine concocting, the disciples of the south bank had been the pillars of the sect, and no one had ever dared to tangle with them. As for the sword cultivators of Green Crest Peak, they gave their mountain peak the reputation of being the strongest in the entire Spirit Stream Sect.But now, for various reasons, everything had changed, and the north bank was the most dominant. They continuously secured victory in the Chosen battles, and as such, earned vast cultivation resources, which ensured that their battle prowess only continued to grow. Furthermore, their practice of cultivation differed somewhat from the south bank, so different that many of the outside cultivator clans had come to view the north bank as the dominant force within the Spirit Stream Sect, and its effective leader.In the Spirit Stream Sect, the south bank used magic to control inanimate objects, while the north bank controlled living beasts!For example, upon joining the sect, Bai Xiaochun had learned the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art. In contrast, the introductory art for north bank disciples was the Heavenspan Elephant Control Art!During the Chosen battles held over the past thousand years, the south bank had suffered defeat over and over again. That was especially true of the battles fought thirty years before, in which only one disciple from the south bank had ended up in the top ten. That, of course, infuriated the elders and peak lords of the three mountain peaks of the south bank. Afterward, they personally went out to look for new talented disciples, which was how Shangguan Tianyou and the other top Chosen came to join the sect.Shangguan Tianyou, Lu Tianlei, and Zhou Xinqi were the trump cards of the south bank. They were the apprentices of the peak lords, and had been meticulously trained until their cultivation bases reached the pinnacle of the eighth level of Qi Condensation. In terms of battle prowess, they were already in a position to be able to defeat many disciples of the Inner Sect.Shangguan Tianyou was the most impressive of them all, adept with void magic, and generally accepted as the number one Chosen of the south bank.Lu Tianlei was skilled with the Dao of lightning, and was extraordinary in his own right. His lightning magic was shocking, and even his Master Xu Meixiang praised him ceaselessly, virtually guaranteeing him a spot in the top ten.Then there was Zhou Xinqi, who showed incredible skill in the Dao of medicine. Of course, as Li Qinghou\u2019s personal apprentice, she also had astonishing magical techniques at her disposal.When Bai Xiaochun learned about the overall situation from Xu Baocai, he couldn\u2019t help but feel indignant at the despotic way the north bank acted.Filled with emotion, he swore to himself: \u201cJust wait until I reach Foundation Establishment. I\u2019ll definitely cut those north bank Outer Sect disciples down a notch or two!\u201dAs far as the south bank qualifying matches, and the subsequent Chosen battles, he wasn\u2019t the least bit interested in them.As far as Bai Xiaochun was concerned, fighting and killing weren\u2019t his style. He was a Prestige disciple, and the Junior Brother of the sect leader. He existed on a higher plane of seniority, and didn\u2019t feel that it was appropriate for him to be competing with members of the junior generation.\u201cBesides, what would happen if I didn\u2019t win?\u201d he thought with a dry cough. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that lose a lot of face for elder Brother Sect Leader? Forget about it. I\u2019m definitely not participating.\u201d When he thought about how much he was sacrificing just for his Elder Brother Sect Leader, he decided that he should probably go burn some incense to his Master and complain a bit about the situation.**Life was great. Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t think much about the Chosen battles. Instead, he visited Big Fatty Zhang as often as he could. Every time Big Fatty Zhang would try a spirit enhancement, Bai Xiaochun would use his turtle-wok to turn it into a success, which led Big Fatty Zhang into new realms of excitement.At a certain point, Big Fatty Zhang began to suspect that something was going on, but was so happy that he simply reveled in the feeling of success. Eventually, he got used to the situation, and came to be convinced that he really was a genius spirit enhancer.Considering the incredible level of self-confidence that he was building, his spirit enhancement magic and power of will also began to grow much stronger.Time passed. A month later, it was only three days until the qualifying round began. It was at that point that Bai Xiaochun got a notice from the sect informing him that attendance in the qualifying round was mandatory for all disciples in the eighth level of Qi Condensation. There were to be no exceptions.After scanning the jade slip, Bai Xiaochun yawned. Assuming there must be some mistake with the message, he continued his pill concocting.Three days later at dawn, bells filled the south bank, and Bai Xiaochun strolled out into the sect to see countless Outer Sect disciples hurrying along with very serious expressions. Spirits rising, he joined the crowd of moving people.Soon, he reached a certain valley behind the three mountain peaks. It was a huge place, paved with white jade, in the middle of which was a huge, open square, with four awe-inspiring columns in the corners carved with coiling dragons.Between each column was another statue depicting a fierce beast, extremely lifelike in appearance. The ferocious nature of it all made the entire valley seethe with a bleak and violent aura.On one of the valley walls was a balcony, upon which numerous notable members of the sect could be seen. Li Qinghou was there, along with Xu Meixiang and the peak lord from the third mountain. Even Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong was present.The qualifying matches for the north and south banks were not held concurrently. The south bank went first, followed by the north bank. That was to ensure that the sect leader didn\u2019t show partiality to one bank or the other. After observing the south bank\u2019s qualifying matches, he would go to the north bank to watch theirs.Li Qinghou and the other peak lords sat near Zheng Yuandong, chatting amiably.Behind them were the elders from the three mountain peaks, including Elder Zhou. Some sat quietly with their eyes closed, others conversed in low tones. A few were observing the disciples pouring into the valley.Bai Xiaochun walked along lazily until he was in the valley itself. Looking around, he realized that he had never been here before. Curious about the statues, he walked over to examine one more closely.As he neared the statue, he noticed that there was even fur on its surface, which rippled in the wind. \u201cThese creatures almost look alive. So interesting.\u201dIt was at this point that the sound of voices suddenly rose up from within the audience.\u201cElder Sister Zhou is on the way!\u201d\u201cElder Sister Zhou has been in the eighth level of Qi Condensation for a while now. She\u2019s definitely going to get into the top ten. In fact, considering her status, she\u2019ll most likely get into the top three!\u201dA blue swath of flying silk appeared off in the distance, upon which could be seen Zhou Xinqi. She first clasped hands and bowed to the balcony, then landed off to the side, where she closed her eyes and sat down quietly. The truth was that she was inwardly nervous; after all her years of cultivation, the qualifying round had finally arrived, and she had to perform well.Up on the balcony, Li Qinghou gave her a faint smile of approval.Smiling, Zheng Yuandong said, \u201cQinghou, not only is Zhou Xinqi extraordinary with plants and vegetation, she also has some shocking magical techniques. I have the feeling she\u2019ll bring glory to the south bank.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for such praise, sect leader,\u201d Li Qinghou replied modestly. \u201cMy apprentice still needs some more tempering. However, her personality is of a type rarely seen among her contemporaries. She really has incredible potential.\u201dMost of the crowd looked over enviously at Zhou Xinqi, but as for Bai Xiaochun, he cleared his throat and looked at her with an expression similar to Li Qinghou\u2019s. Clasping his hands behind his back, he gazed at her with praise and approval.Before people could finish talking about Zhou Xinqi, another small uproar occurred in the crowd. People turned their heads up as the rumble of thunder echoed out. A bolt of lightning snaked out overhead, perched atop which was a young man wearing a long green robe and a haughty expression.Countless lightning bolts spread out in his wake, and thunder boomed around him. He seemed even more impressive than Zhou Xinqi, and when he landed in the square, the area for thirty meters around him turned into a lake of dancing lightning.Sparks of electricity even arced back and forth on his skin.\u201cIt\u2019s Lu Tianlei from Violet Cauldron Peak! Elder Brother Lu has a rare lightning meridian. He\u2019s been in secluded meditation almost the entire time since joining the sect. Now he finally makes his extraordinary debut!\u201d\u201cLu Tianlei is incredible. He cultivates some sort of technique that gives him control of lightning!\u201d As the conversations continued, Lu Tianlei proudly clasped hands in greeting toward the balcony. Then his gaze swept across the crowd. Among all the Outer Sect disciples gathered there, only Zhou Xinqi was someone he considered a worthy opponent. The others weren\u2019t even worth looking at.Up on the balcony, Xu Meixiang smiled, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction. \u201cSect leader, what do you think of the Extreme Dao Lightning Control Magic that my disciple cultivates?\u201dZheng Yuandong smiled and looked a bit more closely at Lu Tianlei. \u201cHe already controls two types of lightning, and he\u2019s only in the eighth level of Qi Condensation. With skill like that, he\u2019s definitely a top Chosen among the disciples under Foundation Establishment.\u201dThe peak lord of Green Crest Peak, the emaciated old man who seemed as sharp as a sword, suddenly looked up with a smile.Zheng Yuandong\u2019s face flickered, and he also turned to look in the same direction. The other elders did the same.A beam of sword light\u2026 split through the clouds, rumbling along with incredible momentum. The clouds seethed as an ancient green sword appeared, a beam that cut through everything in its path, piercing through the air as it shot toward the ground.The sword seemed primeval, forged from bronze, weathered with age and completely extraordinary.An extremely handsome young man stood atop the sword, wearing the robes of an Outer Sect disciple. His black hair whipped about in the wind, and he held his hands clasped behind his back. A faint layer of golden light flickered around him, and behind him could be seen the images of numerous green lotuses.In addition to the lotuses was a nine-meter-long fish with the head of a dragon, which swirled about, sending rainwater falling down everywhere around it.Even before the young man arrived, the rain water was splashing down onto the square. Countless disciples looked up in awe, gasping at the incredible sight.\u201cIt\u2019s Eldest Brother Shangguan!\u201d\u201cThe number one Chosen in the Outer Sect on the south bank. Shangguan Tianyou!\u201d\u201cAccording to the rumors, he has a powerful sword spirit body, and is the reincarnation of some almighty sword cultivator. For some reason, the heavens are guilty, and showered him with countless blessings. When he was three, he was walking down the road and happened to find an ancient sword; when he was seven, a baby Crimson Cloudbeast fell out of the sky and instantly accepted him as its master; when he was thirteen, he acquired a golden light shield. That is why his name is Tianyou!\u201d 1Zhou Xinqi looked over with a grave expression.As for Lu Tianlei, he looked up, lightning dancing in his eyes, sparks surging around him. From the look in his eyes, he was itching to fight.As the green beam of light closed in, Shanguan Tianyou clasped hands toward the balcony and called out, \u201cI, Shangguan Tianyou, offer greetings to the sect leader, my Master, the two peak lords, and all of the various elders.\u201dAs he floated down toward the square, he looked around at all the disciples and nodded.His amiable gaze and friendly nod caused countless disciples to clasp hands in greeting. Many of the female disciples batted their eyes bashfully.Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong gave a hearty laugh and looked over at the peak lord of Green Crest Peak. \u201cWonderful. Simply wonderful!\u201d he said. \u201cAt only the eighth level of Qi Condensation, he can already transform sword qi into lotuses. Regardless of whether this Shangguan Tianyou really is the reincarnation of an almighty cultivator, he definitely has a sword spirit body. To accomplish what he has before Foundation Establishment is truly a rarity!\u201cI have to say that I\u2019m shocked by the south bank\u2019s performance so far!\u201dLi Qinghou and the other peak lords smiled, and the other elders chuckled. All of them clearly wished to have their revenge on the north bank.Zheng Yuandong was about to continue speaking when suddenly he looked down at the square and saw Bai Xiaochun standing there next to the statue, hands clasped behind his back, looking like a member of the senior generation.Chuckling dryly, he said, \u201cThis Bai Xiaochun\u2026 really loves to indulge in his histrionics.\u201d1.

Everyone else was in a huge commotion, but Bai Xiaochun was simply standing there like a member of the senior generation. He couldn\u2019t have stuck out more from everyone else.One of the elders on the balcony smiled and said, \u201cYoung Bai Xiaochun is already in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and fought his way out of certain death at the hands of the Luochen Clan. He\u2019ll definitely make it into the top ten. In fact, he probably has a shot at the top five.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said another elder. \u201cNot only does he have extraordinary skill with plants and vegetation, he also cultivates a shocking type of body refinement. I\u2019d say he\u2019s a definite dark horse in the qualifying round today.\u201dHearing these comments caused the faces of Li Qinghou and Zheng Yuandong to beam. Exchanging a glance, they laughed heartily.\u201cHe\u2019s different from the rest of them,\u201d Li Qinghou said. \u201cHe has much stronger convictions than his contemporaries. When I brought him here to the sect all those years ago, I asked him why he wanted to practice cultivation, and he said it\u2019s because he wants to live forever.\u201d He looked over at Bai Xiaochun with a warm gaze. He\u2019d finally finished preparing a defensive magical item that he planned to give Bai Xiaochun after the qualifying matches were over.\u201cAlright, enough with the praise,\u201d Zheng Yuandong said. \u201cAlthough he\u2019s my Junior Brother, as Qinghou is well aware, he\u2019s stubborn and mischievous. He still needs much tempering. However, he\u2019s a pure and genuine person who doesn\u2019t seek the limelight, which is laudable.\u201d Despite the words he uttered, everyone could tell that Zheng Yuandong\u2019s eyes gleamed with anticipation.As the group on the balcony continued to exchange words, Bai Xiaochun stood there next to the statue, proud and aloof as he looked over at Lu Tianlei, and the crowd favorite that was Shangguan Tianyou. Inwardly, Bai Xiaochun was a bit apprehensive.Lu Tianlei had electricity writhing around him, which left Bai Xiaochun\u2019s scalp numb as he thought back to what it had been like to ride his sword through the thunderstorm. And then there was Shangguan Tianyou, with his incredible good fortune and a sword from ancient times. He also had a shocking energy which left Bai Xiaochun breathless.As far as he could tell, both of them were incredibly strong.But then he thought about his own status, and coughed dryly before once again plastering an approving smile onto his face.\u201cThere are plenty of Chosen to go around,\u201d he thought, \u201cwhich simply goes to show how powerful the Spirit Stream Sect is. But I\u2019m a Prestige disciple, and the Junior Brother of the sect leader. I shouldn\u2019t be comparing myself to my juniors. They are the future of the sect, and bullying them would be wrong. Yeah. Any comparisons should wait until after they\u2019re part of the Inner Sect!\u201d Having made his decision, he continued to stand there looking around approvingly.More and more people crowded into the valley. All of the disciples who were in the eighth level of Qi Condensation were cracking their knuckles in preparation for the fighting. As for those whose cultivation bases were lower, they were naturally coming to act as the audience.Among the three mountain peaks of the south bank, there were roughly a thousand disciples in the eighth level of Qi Condensation, and all of them were present in the valley. Bai Xiaochun was familiar with some of them. However, not all were the type of people who liked crowds and excitement. Many prefered to practice their cultivation in secret, waiting for just such an occasion as this to finally show off.The countless other Outer Sect disciples who didn\u2019t qualify to participate were waiting eagerly to see how the qualifying round would turn out. Everyone was itching to find out who would make it into the top hundred, and of course, the top ten.As for who would be the top three, there didn\u2019t seem to be much suspense about that. Presumably, those spots would go to Shangguan Tianyou, Lu Tianlei, and Zhou Xinqi.Gradually, the thousand or so eighth level disciples quieted down, as did the other surrounding disciples. A sense of pressure began to fill the air, and gradually, a foreboding sense of impending violence.A stifling, suffocating feeling weighed down on everyone, and people started to get nervous.Bai Xiaochun was shocked to find that he was also getting nervous, although he wasn\u2019t sure why. Reminding himself that he wouldn\u2019t be participating, he looked around and forced himself to relax.It was at this time that Li Qinghou\u2019s voice rang out from the balcony above. \u201cThe grand competition between the south and north banks is about to begin!\u201cSome among you have practiced your cultivation in secret, leaving your true level of power unknown to the public. Now is your chance to shine. You should not harbor any fear that your rapid progress or unique good fortune will be the subject of avarice among members of the senior generation. Cultivation is a personal matter, and everyone has a right to their secrets. The Spirit Stream Sect has a ten thousand year history. It is no accident that we grew from a small sect all the way to our current level of glory. All of that is because of the good fortune of our disciples. Whatever good fortune you have acquired is your personal destiny!\u201cSome of you have come to be called Chosen by others. However, that is only because of your natural talents. Talented people can be found everywhere among the defeated. Today is the day to prove yourselves. Today is the day to show whether or not you truly deserve the title which has been bestowed upon you by others. Today you can prove whether or not you truly deserve to be\u2026 Chosen!\u201d Li Qinghou\u2019s voice was deep and filled with pride, and seemed to form a resonance with the somber pressure that filled the area. Those who listened began to pant nervously.The disciples who had various secrets to keep all looked on with shining eyes.As for Lu Tianlei and the other famous disciples, from the expressions on their faces, they clearly were itching to fight.\u201cThe top one hundred competitors in the qualifying round will be promoted to the Inner Sect. The top ten will go on to represent the south bank in the grand finale competition, which is only held once every thirty years. This time, we have a chance to make sure that our compatriots on the north bank remember who we are!\u201d With that, Li Qinghou flicked his sleeve, causing rumbling sounds to fill the air as columns of light shot up from all three of the south banks\u2019 mountain peaks.Everything shook violently; it was as if a pair of invisible hands were ripping apart the air above the valley, causing a huge bridge to appear!It was an ancient, primitive bridge, like something which had been pulled out of primeval times. It was constructed of stone, and was covered with ancient magical symbols that shone with flickering light.The bridge was fully 300 meters wide, and so long that it couldn\u2019t be taken in with a single glance. It was so grand and majestic that compared to it, the valley they were in seemed like nothing more than a stepping stone.The next person to speak was not Li Qinghou, but rather, Xu Meixiang. \u201cThis is the Spirit Stream Bridge, a precious treasure of our sect. It has been summoned to act as your path in this trial by fire. After the ninth bell toll, all disciples in the eighth level of Qi Condensation will step onto the bridge!\u201d Xu Meixiang stood there, beautiful and somber, her gown fluttering in the wind, her hair floating around her. She looked less like a woman and more like an immortal.\u201cWhoever reaches the end of the bridge first will take first place. The same method will be used to determine who is in the top hundred, and the top ten!\u201d As Xu Meixiang\u2019s voice continued to echo out in the valley, the disciples looked eagerly at the bridge up above.This format of competition was a comprehensive way to test the disciples. The rules didn\u2019t prohibit fighting; as long as no lethal attacks were made, anything was permitted. Whoever reached the end first would be the winner!Of course, there would be obstacles along the way, and even luck would play a part.The audience panted as they waited, eyes glittering, cultivation bases stirring. Bai Xiaochun stood there yawning as the bells began to toll.Once, twice, thrice\u2026. Four tolls, five tolls, six\u2026.The sound of the bells struck the minds of the disciples, causing their hearts to pound. They began to rotate their cultivation bases faster and faster as they gathered together the energy they had built up.Soon the bells had rung seven times, and then eight\u2026. Finally, when the ninth tolling of the bell could be heard, rumbling sounds filled the air as the cultivation bases of all of the eighth level disciples exploded out with full force. Like arrows loosed from a bow, all of the disciples shot into action!Over a thousand people flew into motion toward the ancient bridge. In the blink of an eye, everyone was on its surface, speeding along. Shangguan Tianyou was the fastest, standing on his flying sword, a green beam of light that instantly took the lead!Right behind him was Lu Tianlei, surrounded by crackling lightning. His energy only seemed to grow, and his speed was incredible as he attempted to close the gap between himself and Shangguan Tianyou, eyes bloodshot, howling.In third place was Zhou Xinqi, her blue flying silk rippling as she advanced at top speed.There were a few people directly behind them, none of them very well-known. Just as Li Qinghou had said, there were disciples who had concealed their true cultivation bases, waiting just for this opportunity to explode out with full force. That group almost immediately pulled out ahead of the pack, and from the look of it, they still had energy to go faster.The surrounding audience of disciples looked on with wide eyes, hearts pounding at the scene which was unfolding in front of them.However, as wind blasted out from the sudden acceleration of the eighth level disciples, Bai Xiaochun was left standing alone in the square.After the ninth bell toll, the wind buffeted his face, and he blinked. He stood there alone, looking up at the thousand disciples racing along, sighing in admiration.\u201cKeep it up guys!\u201d he shouted. A moment later, he leaped into motion, landing on the bridge and running along. In the end, he decided that he might as well participate in the qualifying match, but that he wouldn\u2019t even try to get into the top ten or hundred.\u201cI heard the north bank is full of fiends. I\u2019d be an idiot to try to fight with them.\u201d He moved along lazily, clearly having no desire or intention of being promoted to the Inner Sect. In his view, he was already a Prestige disciple and the Junior Brother of the sect leader, and therefore had no need to become an Inner Sect disciple.Therefore, he simply enjoyed the scenery, cheering the other disciples on. He made quite a contrast with the other competitors.The audience members looked on with wide eyes and strange expressions.Meanwhile, on the balcony, veins bulged out on Li Qinghou\u2019s face as he glared at Bai Xiaochun, feeling like his head was about to explode.Xu Meixiang and the peak lord from Green Crest Peak exchanged an incredulous glance and then smiled wryly. The other elders\u2019 eyes went wide. Never could they possibly have imagined that something like this would take place in the qualifying matches.Were it any other disciple, they would quickly go teach him a lesson. But Bai Xiaochun had a special status, so all the elders could do was look over at Li Qinghou and Zheng Yuandong.Zheng Yuandong felt a headache coming on from the embarrassing loss of face\u2026. Clearing his throat, he glanced over at Elder Zhou.\u201cElder Zhou, whatever happens next, I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t see. You know, that phoenix of yours really suffered a lot.\u201dElder Zhou instantly understood. Face darkening, he flew up into the air toward Bai Xiaochun.\u201cBai Xiaochun,\u201d he roared, \u201cnobody can save you today! Once I get my hands on you, I\u2019ll make sure you understand exactly how my phoenix suffered!!\u201d With that, he shot toward the bridge like a bird of prey.\u2014Translator: Deathblade.

When he turned to look over his shoulder and saw Elder Zhou charging aggressively toward him, his eyes went wide, and he almost fainted from fright.Elder Zhou looked like a fiendish, murderous monster, and although he wasn\u2019t shouting that he intended to take Bai Xiaochun\u2019s life, only that he was going to make him experience the same suffering the phoenix had, Bai Xiaochun thought about what the phoenix had looked like after a full day of pouncing on the other birds of Fragrant Cloud Peak. The mere idea left his hair standing on end.He couldn\u2019t help but imagine what it would be like to be in the place of that phoenix, and his eyes went wide. Shaking, he looked forward again and began to pick up speed.He didn\u2019t lack courage; he simply feared death. However\u2026 what was happening now had occurred too suddenly. Furthermore, there were things in this world to be feared more than death, such as, being transformed into a phoenix\u2026.When he thought about that, Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but scream: \u201cElder Brother, save me! I don\u2019t want to get transformed into a bird!\u201dUp on the balcony, Zheng Yuandong cleared his throat and pretended not to hear.Because of the sudden and intense provocation, Bai Xiaochun let out one blood-curdling scream after another. At the same time, he increased his speed explosively. In the blink of an eye, he transformed into a series of afterimages as he shot toward the disciples who were running along in last place. Those disciples felt something like a wind bearing down on them from behind, then stared in shock as Bai Xiaochun shot past them at high speed.\u201cHow\u2026 how fast is he going?!?!\u201d Everyone was shocked enough as it was, but then Elder Zhou came racing by in hot pursuit of Bai Xiaochun. That caused countless disciples to all gasp.The Outer Sect disciples in the audience all stared at what was happening, eyes wide with shock.\u201cI can\u2019t believe Bai Xiaochun is going so fast!\u201d\u201cIt seems that being chased makes him go a lot faster than usual\u2026.\u201dThe audience was in an uproar, and Bai Xiaochun wanted to cry, although no tears came. He felt completely maligned as he fled for his life, passing one disciple after another, all of whom gasped in shock. There was one of them who wasn\u2019t willing to be overtaken. Gritting his teeth, he pushed forward with all the speed he could muster, and yet in the end, he could only watch as Bai Xiaochun sped past him into the distance ahead.\u201cDammit, he\u2019s running faster than a mouse whose tail got stepped on!\u201dBy now, disciples both on and off the bridge were completely shaken by the terrifying display of speed put on by Bai Xiaochun. Even the sect leader and the others on the balcony could only look on with jaws wide open, totally shocked by the speed they were witnessing.Smiling wryly, Li Qinghou looked over at Zheng Yuandong and said, \u201cWell\u2026 you really know how to handle things, sect leader!\u201dXu Meixiang and the old man from Green Crest Peak had strange expressions on their faces, and the other surrounding elders couldn\u2019t hold back from chuckling.Zheng Yuandong cleared his throat. \u201cFor a stubborn, mischievous kid like him\u2026 there really isn\u2019t any other option.\u201dAt the same time, Bai Xiaochun was picking up more speed, throwing the audience into even further commotion.\u201cHe\u2019s already passed up half of the other disciples! At this rate, he\u2019ll definitely make it into the top hundred!\u201dSome of the audience instantly devolved into cheering.\u201cGo, Sect Uncle Bai, go\u2026!\u201dHowever, it was at this point that the stones on the bridge suddenly trembled, and began to transform into numerous puppets. Eyes glittering, the puppets roared and lunged toward the charging disciples.In the lead position was Shangguan Tianyou, whose expression was the same as ever as he waved a sword through the air, causing several puppets to explode. He didn\u2019t even slow down by a bit, maintaining his first place position.Close behind were Lu Tianlei and Zhou Xinqi, as well as the handful of other disciples who had kept their cultivation and identities secret. The entire group easily dispatched the puppets and continued onward at full speed.Puppets appeared around Bai Xiaochun as well. He watched anxiously as they closed in on him, and was just about to attack when suddenly, a screaming wind could be heard behind him as Elder Zhou approached.\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind, Bai Xiaochun! After I catch you, I won\u2019t make you experience what my phoenix did. I\u2019ll make you feel the pain that the other birds felt!\u201d With that, he cackled cruelly. By this point, he was pulling out all the stops in his attempt to incite Bai Xiaochun\u2026.When Bai Xiaochun heard Elder Zhou\u2019s words, all of the blood in his body rushed to his brain, and his vision began to fade. He thought about the miserable fates of the birds, the anguished calls of the spirit tail chickens, and the powerful body of the phoenix. Then\u2026 he let out the most piercing, agonized scream of his entire life.\u201cHelp me! I don\u2019t want to be pounced on\u2026.\u201dHe was now even more scared than he had been when being chased down by the Luochen Clan. Never before in his life had he been incited in such a matter. As he screamed and trembled, silver light began to shine from his skin, covering him to the point where he almost seemed to be made from silver.At that point, he broke through to another level of speed. Even as Elder Zhou bore down on him, he bolted off like a startled wild boar.RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!He was now moving so fast that any puppets who got near him were instantly bashed away and sent flying through the air. He was like a streak of light that shot forward at blinding speed.From a distance, it wasn\u2019t even possible to see Bai Xiaochun, only the countless puppets being tossed up into the air after being hit.He was now moving far, far faster than he had been before, and quickly passed up the top four hundred to reach the top three hundred. Then two hundred. Until finally\u2026 he was in the top hundred!He was moving too fast!Rumbling sounds echoed out as he passed countless disciples, who were left staring in shock at the maddened Bai Xiaochun. He screamed as he flew along, eyes wide and bloodshot, swearing to himself that he must never, ever allow himself to be caught by Elder Zhou.He\u2019d already forgotten about the trial by fire, or about the rankings. All he was thinking was that he needed to run, run, run\u2026 off of the bridge!The other disciples in his path became obstacles that he would grab and send flying off to the side.The audience simply watched in amazement.\u201cIs he\u2026 even human!?!?\u201d\u201cNo way! He\u2019s like a mix between a wild boar and a dragon!!\u201dElder Zhou stared in amazement as Bai Xiaochun proceeded along without avoiding anything in his path, and instead just slammed everything out of his way. Elder Zhou could help but wonder\u2026 if he had pushed Bai Xiaochun a bit too far.Nothing seemed capable of holding him back. His speed defied description, and yet, he continued to accelerate. Then, rumbling sounds echoed out as a new obstacle appeared. Instead of puppets, numerous webs popped up, stretching out in front of the disciples to impede their progress.However, the instant a web appeared in front of Bai Xiaochun, he blasted right through it, leaving behind nothing more than a hole. Popping sounds rang out as the nets didn\u2019t hinder him for even a moment.It was as if his incredible speed had transformed him into a razor-sharp blade!Next, the ground began to ripple as it transformed into a quagmire, complete with occasional whirlpools. The sudden change slowed many people down, but not Bai Xiaochun\u2026. He didn\u2019t even notice what had happened. A whooshing sound could be heard as he shot forward. Not even the spinning whirlpools could slow him down.Soon, he was in the top eighty. Then the top fifty, thirty, and finally, the top ten\u2026.Upon seeing this, Elder Zhou gasped. Considering his reaction, there was almost no need to mention the disciples in the audience. All eyes were fixed on Bai Xiaochun; not a single person was even looking at Shangguan Tianyou and the other front runners.A bald young man with cold, sinister eyes appeared up in front of Bai Xiaochun. He had been concealing his true battle prowess for years, and rarely had any contact with anyone. His entire purpose on this day was to make sure the so-called top three Chosen knew that there were always more powerful people out there in the world.His entire person radiated flickering light, and three pearls swirled around him, allowing him to slash through all obstacles like a sharp knife through bamboo. As he sped forward, a dozen or so vortexes sprang up around him. However, he knew that as long as he kept his momentum going through the current area, they would soon disappear.\u201cThe stronger you are, the more vortexes appear. I wonder how many vortexes appeared for the people who passed through this area head of me. It must have been a shocking scene.\u201d Even as the bald-headed disciple murmured to himself, he heard something whooshing through the air behind him. Surprised, he assumed that he must be hearing things. After all, there was nothing that could possibly speed through the air like that, not here\u2026.However, before he could even turn his head, a blast of wind overtook him, and a figure blurred past him at top speed. Surrounding that person were over a hundred vortexes!The bald disciple\u2019s eyes went wide as the figure sped past him without slowing down at all. The disciple rubbed his eyes, thinking he must have been seeing things. By that point, he could just barely make out the person speeding away in the distance.\u201cImpossible!!\u201d he mouthed.Trembling, Bai Xiaochun screamed, shooting forward with over a hundred vortexes surrounding him. However, after passing through the current region, they vanished. Picking up speed, he passed more disciples. All of these people were in the top ten, and for years had been concealing their good fortune and strength, hoping to reveal it in shocking fashion now. But then Bai Xiaochun showed up, and all they could do was stare in astonishment at his freakish performance.Zhou Xinqi gritted her teeth as she entered a new area. Intense pressure weighed down as if to lock her in place, forcing her to slow down.However, even as she struggled forward, she heard cracking sounds from behind her. Jaw dropping, she looked around, whereupon her pupils constricted in disbelief.A boom rang out as Bai Xiaochun shot past her. He was moving so fast that the pressure which attempted to slow him down did nothing. Cracking sounds could be heard, and fissures opened up in the air\u2026 which then shattered!\u201cBai Xiaochun? Impossible!\u201d She could only watch as Bai Xiaochun shattered the solidifying pressure and then shot onward like a bolt of lightning.\u2014Translator: Deathblade.

Took First?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEven as Zhou Xinqi reeled in shock, another blast of wind swept over her, and Elder Zhou appeared. As he passed, he looked over and smiled, and she nodded in return.Despite the faint smile on his face, when he spoke, the voice of a fiendish monster echoed out from his mouth.\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind again, Bai Xiaochun. After I catch you, I\u2019m going to starve you for a month, then put you in with a flock of phoenixes and a horde of wild beasts!\u201dZhou Xinqi\u2019s eyes went wide, and at the same time, a miserable scream could be heard coming from Bai Xiaochun.\u201cHelp me, Uncle Li! Save me, dear Elder Brother Sect Leader! I don\u2019t want to starve! I don't want to get locked up with phoenixes and wild beasts....\u201d Bai Xiaochun was trembling in fear as he conjured mental images of the scenes described by Elder Zhou. Screaming, he shot forward with incredible speed, transforming into nothing more than a shadow.Up ahead, Lu Tianlei sped along in lightning form. Although the early stages of the path had been easy for him, things had slowly grown more and more difficult. The area he currently faced was filled with razor-sharp wind blades, and if he proceeded too quickly, it would cause them to fly toward him.He had summoned a puppet moments before, and sent it ahead as a test, but because it moved too quickly, it was instantly slashed to pieces by the wind blades. Because of that, Lu Tianlei knew that he had no other option than to slow down. Only after finding the proper equilibrium would he be able to continue moving forward.Shangguan Tianyou was so far ahead he wasn\u2019t even visible. Given his consummate level of talent, he had been able to transform into emptiness and then pass through the area effortlessly. The wind blades didn\u2019t so much as touch him. Lu Tianlei, who had previously believed himself to be on an equal level with Shangguan Tianyou, was left with hatred seething in his heart.\u201cSo what if you possess void magic?\u201d Lu Tianlei thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s so amazing about that? Just wait till I get past this area... I\u2019ll definitely catch up and take first place!\u201d By this point, Lu Tianlei didn\u2019t even think of Zhou Xinqi as being worthy of note. The only thing he cared about was overtaking Shangguan Tianyou and winning first place.Taking a deep breath, he stepped out into the wind blade zone and prepared to pick up speed. But then, a blast of wind could be heard behind him.The deafening sound caused all of the flying wind blades to tremble. When Lu Tianlei saw that, he smiled in delight.\u201cHah! It\u2019s definitely Zhou Xinqi. What a moron. If she enters this area going that fast, all the wind blades will head in her direction. I should take advantage of that moment to charge forward!\u201d Looking back, he saw someone skinny racing toward him as fast as lightning. As soon as the person entered the area with the wind blades, he was already a third of the way through, placing him only about 3,000 meters away from Lu Tianlei.Because of his incredible speed, it only took the blink of an eye for countless wind blades to swirl together into an enormous cyclone.At first, he gasped, shocked by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s speed. But then, he began to chuckle inwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s not Zhou Xinqi? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s moving way too fast. Is he looking to get killed?! When practicing cultivation, one should rely on one\u2019s wits!\u201dLaughing, Lu Tianlei watched as the wind blades grouped together. At the same time, he gathered the lightning which surrounded him, preparing to make a break for the exit.Before he could pick up any speed, the screaming Bai Xiaochun continued onward without slowing down at all. Rumbling sounds echoed out as he actually picked up speed.There were so many wind blades it was impossible to tell how many there were. And yet, when they slammed into Bai Xiaochun, silver light flashed, and to Lu Tianlei\u2019s shock, they all shattered.Countless wind blades fell to pieces, and by the time they reformed, Bai Xiaochun had flown past Lu Tianlei.Of course, the wind blades wouldn\u2019t let him by so easily, and began to race to catch up.Lu Tianlei\u2019s jaw dropped and his eyes went wide. Then, his scalp went numb and his mind began to spin.\u201cImpossible!!\u201d he said in a hoarse voice. Before the countless wind blades could catch up to Bai Xiaochun\u2026 he was gone.The wind blades shuddered to a stop angrily, then slowly turned toward Lu Tianlei....Heart pounding, Lu Tianlei immediately slowed down. However, having been completely frustrated by Bai Xiaochun, the wind blades didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment to pounce on him.\u201cNo... NO!!\u201dMoments later, miserable shrieks began to ring out.As he ran on up ahead, Bai Xiaochun was a bit surprised to hear the bloodcurdling screams behind him. However, there was no time for him to look back. Elder Zhou seemed to be right behind him, bellowing in rage, leaving Bai Xiaochun with no choice but to charge onward, jaw clenched, expression pained.Thankfully, Elder Zhou was able to rescue Lu Tianlei from the countless swirling wind blades. If he had come a moment later, Lu Tianlei, whose clothing was now ripped to shreds, would most likely have been left with no other choice than to forfeit.Eyes bloodshot, Lu Tianlei finally realized who Bai Xiaochun was. Voice filled with rage, he bellowed, \u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201dUnaware that he had unwittingly caused yet another person to hate him, Bai Xiaochun moved on at top speed, passing through numerous empty areas. After enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn, he caught sight of the end of the bridge up ahead.\u201cI'm finally near the end!\u201d he thought excitedly. What he didn\u2019t notice was that there was someone else near the end, trodding forward one step at a time.Shangguan Tianyou was panting. Most of the path had been very easy for him, with the difficulty rising only at the very end.\u201cI can\u2019t believe this place suppresses spiritual power and also has such crushing pressure!\u201d A brutal gleam appeared in his eyes as he proceeded forward. The spiritual power in the area was locked down tight, and there was also huge pressure. He felt like there was a mountain resting on his shoulders, and even more shocking was that with every step he took, it felt like an entire additional mountain was added. Although there were only a total of a hundred steps to take, the difficulty was intense, and he was left trembling physically. He was already quickly approaching his limit.The closer he got to the end, the greater the pressure grew, and the more mountains he felt building up on him. Eventually, he reached the point where he had only ten more steps to take. However, those ten steps seemed almost insurmountable.Shangguan Tianyou took a deep breath, and determination flickered in his eyes.\u201cThe first place spot in the qualifying round belongs to me. I'm going to get into the Chosen battles, and I'm going to take first place there, too! After I get into the Inner Sect, then my future will be in the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s Legacy Echelon!\u201d Gritting his teeth, he was just about to take another step when he sensed something behind him, and turned to see Bai Xiaochun.\u201cIt\u2019s him....\u201d There were few people on the south bank who didn\u2019t know Bai Xiaochun. Although Shangguan Tianyou had never met him personally, he had attended his funeral and seen his portrait. The fact that Bai Xiaochun was directly behind him was somewhat of a surprise; he had assumed it would be Lu Tianlei.\u201cIt seems I thought a bit too much of Lu Tianlei. What a useless fool.\u201d Looking away, Shangguan Tianyou completely ignored Bai Xiaochun. As far as he was concerned, he was on a completely different level than Bai Xiaochun. Lifting his foot and stepping forward, he heard creaking sounds emanating from his bones.However, even as he took that single step. Bai Xiaochun also took a step forward. When he felt nothing, he took a second step, and then a third and a fourth....Soon he had taken fifty steps, whereupon he stopped and looked up into the air.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why do I feel heavier?\u201dIt was at this point that Shangguan Tianyou trembled and put his foot down, having completed one single step. Having taken over ninety steps, he felt like he was on the verge of collapse. He was out of breath, but his expression was one of satisfaction. Then he looked back and saw Bai Xiaochun standing there, having taken fifty steps.His eyes went wide.\u201cHow... how is he moving so fast!?\u201d Looking shocked, he quickly gritted his teeth. \u201cHe must be a body refinement cultivator. That will help him move more quickly at the beginning. But toward the end, things will get more difficult for him. He--\u201d Before Shangguan Tianyou could finish his train of thought, a tremor ran through him, and he looked on in shock as Bai Xiaochun suddenly began to run.\u201cRun... he\u2019s... he\u2019s running?\u201d Shangguan Tianyou watched wide-eyed as Bai Xiaochun trotted up to him.\u201cHey, why are you going so slow?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked. Looking over his shoulder, he saw no sign of Elder Zhou, and finally breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cYou... don\u2019t feel like there are mountains on your back?\u201d Shangguan Tianyou asked without even thinking about it, his eyelids twitching.\u201cMountains?\u201d Bai Xiaochun jumped up and down a few times. \u201cEee? Hm, yeah a few, but I can hardly feel them.\u201d Shangguan Tianyou gasped in disbelief.Bai Xiaochun continued to jump up and down a few times, but then suddenly, he saw Elder Zhou off in the distance. With a shriek, he suddenly shot forward through the final nine steps, taking him off of the bridge\u2026. Then his speed increased dramatically, and he was gone from sight.When that happened, Elder Zhou finally slowed down and then began to chuckle wryly.\u201cBai Xiaochun... actually took first place?\u201dSimultaneously, back on the balcony, Zheng Yuandong, Li Qinghou, and everyone else shot to their feet, strange expressions on their faces. The elders almost couldn\u2019t believe their eyes. Although they had been prepared for a surprising outcome when they saw Bai Xiaochun overtake Zhou Xinqi and Lu Tianlei, the ease with which Bai Xiaochun passed the final section was flabbergasting.\u201cHe... took first?\u201d Li Qinghou murmured.A moment later, a huge uproar could be heard coming from the disciples who had gathered to watch the qualifying round.\u201cBai Xiaochun... passed up Zhou Xinqi, Lu Tianlei and Shangguan Tianyou! He took first!\u201d\u201cHeavens! Bai Xiaochun actually took first!\u201d\u201cThe only reason he took first was because of Elder Zhou. Anyone would have fled for their life with him chasing them!\u201dShangguan Tianyou\u2019s face was pale white, and his mind was spinning. His vision began to go dark, as though lightning were crashing in his mind.He could only watch as Bai Xiaochun simply walked off of the bridge ahead of him. He began to tremble violently.\u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201d Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s eyes were completely bloodshot. His pride, his self-respect, everything about him had just been trampled by Bai Xiaochun. Worst of all was how Bai Xiaochun had actually asked him why he was going so slow.All of the blood in his body began to rush toward his head, and the sword qi inside of him boiled on the verge of exploding. Eyes crimson, he threw caution to the wind and lurched forward nine steps, after which he coughed up a mouthful of blood.\u201cBai Xiaochun, I, Shangguan Tianyou, did not lose this day. I... refuse to admit defeat. In the Chosen battles, I\u2019ll make sure you realize well and good that among the Outer Sect disciples... nobody can beat me!\u201d Grinding his teeth, he looked off in the direction Bai Xiaochun had disappeared in, eyes bursting with the desire to do battle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 86: That Again....Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86: That Again\u2026.Terrified out of his mind, Bai Xiaochun flew off of the mountain and out of the sect. It wasn\u2019t until he reached the market that he actually stopped and looked behind him.\u201cWhat do I do now?\u201d Scowling miserably, heart aching from how much he was being wronged, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the fact that the bird really had stolen the medicinal pill from him. How was he supposed to explain it? Elder Zhou was so unreasonable\u2026.Even as he began to descend into despondency, he suddenly thought of something. \u201cWait a second, did I just\u2026 get first place?\u201cAiya. As the Junior Brother of the sect leader, I didn\u2019t want to compete with all of my juniors.\u201d Coughing dryly, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit pleased with himself. But then he remembered that, having taken first place, he now had no choice but to participate in the Chosen battles with the north bank, and his heart sank.He moped around the market until night fell. Worried that it still wasn\u2019t safe to go back, he finally pulled out a transmission jade slip and sent a message to Xu Baocai, asking him to go check if Elder Zhou was lurking about his courtyard.After getting word back that the coast was clear, he cautiously returned to the sect. From a distance, he could see Xu Baocai waiting outside of his courtyard, so after looking around carefully one more time, he hurried over.Xu Baocai looked excitedly at him, and was about to say something when Bai Xiaochun dragged him into the courtyard.After the door closed, Xu Baocai said, \u201cSect Uncle Bai, don\u2019t worry. Elder Zhou was sent away by the sect earlier\u2026.\u201dHis eyes burned with zeal as he stared at Bai Xiaochun. \u201cBack in the Ovens he stayed completely hidden,\u201d he thought. \u201cHe even sold spots into the Outer Sect. Afterward, he took place in that minor competition, which caused a bit of a stir. After that came the incident with the Luochen Clan. After he came back alive, he became a Prestige disciple, and even the Junior Brother of the sect leader. Now he took first place in the qualifying match. Bai Xiaochun\u2026 is definitely going to be super famous in the future!\u201dThe fact that Bai Xiaochun had exceeded everyone to become the number one disciple had long since shaken Xu Baocai. By now, he viewed him as a breathtaking figure of legend. Thinking back to everything he had done, Xu Baocai couldn\u2019t hold back from clasping hands and bowing very deeply.\u201cSect Uncle Bai,\u201d he said, \u201ccongratulations on taking first place in the qualifying round!\u201dBai Xiaochun looked around the courtyard for a moment before heaving a sigh of relief. Peering in the direction of Elder Zhou\u2019s immortal\u2019s cave for a moment, he swore an oath that once he reached Foundation Establishment, he would feast on phoenix stew!In response to Xu Baocai\u2019s words, he cleared his throat. Looking very much like a member of the senior generation, he said, \u201cI\u2019m really not that amazing. I\u2019m more like a cloud in the sky. Originally, I didn\u2019t want to compete with all of those junior disciples, but then Elder Zhou came along. What else was I supposed to do?\u201dBefore, Xu Baocai wouldn\u2019t have been able to prevent a look of scorn from appearing on his face in response to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words. But now, Bai Xiaochun was a Chosen among Chosen.\u201cYou always kept a low profile, Sect Uncle Bai,\u201d he responded quickly. \u201cHowever, a Chosen can only stay hidden for so long. Even without intending to, you would have made a big scene one way or another!\u201dXu Baocai\u2019s words filled Bai Xiaochun with elation. However, he maintained an aloof expression, although his eyes sparkled with approval.Xu Baocai could sense that Bai Xiaochun was encouraging him, so he continued on excitedly: \u201cSect Uncle Bai, when it comes time for the Chosen battles with the north bank, the south bank will no longer have the reputation of being weak. All thanks to you! You\u2019re going to rock the north bank!\u201cSupposedly, the five great Chosen of the north bank are the strongest disciples under Foundation Establishment. They\u2019re all fiendish monsters! Thankfully, you\u2019re going to show them that the top Chosen of the sect is here on the south bank, on Fragrant Cloud Peak!\u201d\u201cFive great Chosen?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said. His expression was the same as ever, but his heart was beginning to pound.\u201cYeah! The north bank has five great Chosen. There\u2019s Beihan Lie from Sunset Peak. He\u2019s cold and arrogant, and cultivates one of the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s ten great secret magics, the Sunset Incantation. He also has a Nighstalker Beast, a horrifying and powerful creature that rips people to shreds. Together, they\u2019ve slaughtered their way to becoming the most powerful fighters under the ninth level of Qi Condensation! In fact, he\u2019s known as the number one disciple on Sunset Peak!\u201d\u201cRips people to shreds?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, eyes widening.\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. There\u2019s also Xu Song from Archway Peak, who was born with a Godchanneling body. The peak lord of Archway Peak paid a huge price to get him to join as a disciple. He\u2019s a complete expert in controlling wild beasts. According to the rumors, he can actually control five beasts at the same time. One time when a rogue Qi Condensation cultivator pissed him off, he chased the guy down for three months and then fed him to his battle beasts. The only thing left behind was the guy\u2019s skeleton!\u201d\u201cOnly the skeleton?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, mind reeling.\u201cEven more ferocious than him are the third and fourth Chosen, a brother and sister team from Irispetal Peak. The sister\u2019s name is Gongsun Wan\u2019er. She\u2019s spectacularly beautiful and an expert with birds of prey. One time she had a fight with Zhou Xinqi, and nobody could tell who came out on top!\u201cThe brother is Gongsun Yun, who excels in the Dao of bugs. He always wears a black robe, which is filled with all sorts of bugs. People even say that his body is filled with bug eggs. What a freak! He usually covers his enemies with bugs, and then has them bore into their bodies and drink their blood. The pain is so horrible that people usually just want to die. If you don\u2019t escape quickly enough, you\u2019ll be completely eaten up, with only your bones left behind!\u201d\u201cOnly your bones?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, gasping. Visualizing the scene, his scalp began to tingle.\u201cThe last of the the five great Chosen of the north bank\u2026 is a mysterious and legendary figure who has no known name. Twenty years ago, the peak lord of Ghostfang Peak brought him back to the sect from some unknown location. People just call him Ghostfang, and he\u2019s an expert in magics relating to the Dao of ghosts. He also practices one of the legendary ten secret magics of the Spirit Stream Sect, a magic equally as difficult to cultivate as the Waterswamp Kingdom\u2026 Ghosts Haunt the Night! Rumor has it that he can already summon a hundred ghosts! People say that he\u2019s the number one Chosen on the north bank\u2026.\u201d Having heard the complete explanation of what Xu Baocai knew, Bai Xiaochun was left trembling in fear.Terrifyingly, the Chosen from the north bank were far more ferocious than the Chosen from the south bank. Although the north bank focused on controlling animals, and it made sense that they would be slightly more violent, the actual disparity with the south bank was enormous.\u201cWe\u2019ve been outdone by the north bank for years now,\u201d Xu Baocai went on to say. \u201cEvery time the Chosen battles come around, we always lose. In fact, last time, nine of the top ten were all from the north bank. What a humiliation. We\u2013\u201d At this point, Xu Baocai noticed that Bai Xiaochun had a very odd expression on his face.\u201cSect Uncle Bai, are you okay?\u201dBai Xiaochun quickly stuck his chin out and sternly said, \u201cAs a member of the south bank, hearing things like this makes me very angry!\u201d\u201cSect Uncle Bai, you don\u2019t need to get angry. With you fighting, the north bank will finally be able to see how awesome the south bank is!\u201d Xu Baocai clenched his fists in excitement.Now that Bai Xiaochun had been thrust onto the stage, he found it hard to get off. Standing straight, he lifted his chin, flicked his sleeve, and said, \u201cWhat does the north bank count for? With the wave of a hand, I can turn them all into ashes!\u201dXu Baocai chatted excitedly for a few more minutes before taking his leave.By that time, it was late into the night. Bai Xiaochun stood there alone in his courtyard, thinking about the five people Xu Baocai had just told him about. Then, the wind began to blow, and he felt a chill creeping up his back.\u201cWhat kind of people are they over on the north bank? They raise beasts and bugs and ghosts\u2026 It\u2019s spine-chilling\u2026.\u201d Walking back to his log cabin, the things Xu Baocai had told him continued to rattle around in his mind.The more he thought about the situation, the more fishy it seemed. Finally, he came to a conclusion. \u201cElder Zhou must have done this on purpose!\u201cThe thing I hate most in life is all the fighting and killing!\u201d After more thought, he decided that nothing in the world would be able to get him to participate in the Chosen battles.The next morning at dawn, before he could even come up with a plan of how to avoid the Chosen Battles, a command jade slip flew down from the top of Fragrant Cloud Peak in a black beam of light. After it arrived, Li Qinghou\u2019s voice could be heard.\u201cBai Xiaochun, you took first place in the qualifying round on the south bank. In half a month, you will join nine others to participate in the joint south and north bank Chosen battles! If you don\u2019t participate, you will be thrown into 10,000 Snakes Valley!\u201d\u201cThat again\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun said with a scowl. He suddenly had the feeling that he had been completely conned by Elder Zhou\u2026.As Li Qinghou\u2019s voice faded away, the jade slip vanished, whereupon a bracelet became visible, which floated down in front of Bai Xiaochun.Surprised, he looked at the bracelet, and then poured some spiritual power into it. The bracelet immediately melted into a black liquid, which then circled around Bai Xiaochun\u2019s wrist and then covered his entire body.Moments later, Bai Xiaochun heard Li Qinghou\u2019s voice again, explaining how to use the magic of the item. Apparently, this bracelet could defend against the full-power attack of an early Foundation Establishment cultivator!Bai Xiaochun shivered. He was no newcomer to the sect, so he knew exactly how much an item like this was worth. It was no less valuable than the Divine Crane Shield given to him by the sect leader. Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but look up toward the top of Fragrant Cloud Peak.Although Li Qinghou hadn\u2019t said much about the item other than give a brief introduction, Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but feel a warm feeling when he looked at it. Then he thought back to when he had participated in the smaller competition years before, and the look of anticipation he\u2019d seen on Li Qinghou\u2019s face.After a while, he gritted his teeth and made his decision.\u201cFine. I\u2019m going to fight in the Chosen battles!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 87: Outer Sect Chosen BattlesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87: Outer Sect Chosen BattlesDays passed. Bai Xiaochun spent his time in secluded meditation, not taking even a single step outdoors. Ten days later, the sound of bells filled the sect, and Bai Xiaochun\u2019s jade slip began to vibrate.The Chosen battles between the south and north banks were about to begin!Like they did every thirty years, the matches would be held on Mount Daoseed. As the sound of bells rang out to fill the sect, countless Outer Sect disciples flooded toward that very mountain.Normally, the north and south banks had few dealings with each other. Only Inner Sect disciples qualified to travel back and forth between them. Now that Mount Daoseed had been opened up, Outer Sect disciples from both banks excitedly rushed over to watch the Chosen battles.\u201cThis time our south bank is definitely going to wash away the disgrace of past times!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure the north bank knows that we\u2019ve risen to new heights of glory!\u201dThe south bank Outer Sect disciples were all very excited. At the same time, the Outer Sect disciples from the north bank were also rushing toward Mount Daoseed, boasting amongst themselves the entire way.\u201cThe south bank is so weak! They\u2019ve lost to us for a thousand years, and this time will be no different!\u201d\u201cThe south bank is destined to lose. In the Spirit Stream Sect, the north bank rules and the south bank drools!!\u201dThe buzz of conversation filled the air as countless Outer Sect disciples streamed toward Mount Daoseed. On Green Crest Peak, Shangguan Tianyou stood there with a cold expression on his face, his gaze as sharp as daggers as he suddenly flew out into the air.Meanwhile, on Violet Cauldron Peak, Lu Tianlei threw his head back and bellowed. Electricity danced around him as he burst into motion, accompanied by the cheers of numerous disciples.Zhou Xinqi also flew out into the air. The three great Chosen of the south bank all had very serious looks on their faces.As for Bai Xiaochun, he was still in his residence, his eyes bloodshot as he took a deep breath. Looking very serious, he said, \u201cThe time has come\u2026. When the warrior goes to battle, he must don his combat uniform!\u201d Rising slowly to his feet, he slapped his bag of holding, producing eight leather jackets. The jackets he\u2019d worn during his fight with the Luochen Clan had all been destroyed. These were new jackets, of higher quality and much more durable.After somberly donning all of the leather clothing, he waved his arm.\u201cWhen the warrior goes to battle, he must have his armor!\u201d With that, a large wok flew out of his bag of holding. Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s wok had also been destroyed in the fighting with the Luochen Clan. This was a new wok that he\u2019d acquired after his return. Looking very serious, he strapped the black wok to his back.\u201cWhen the warrior goes to battle, he must have a magical weapon!\u201d Even as the words left his mouth, he waved his hand, causing a little wooden sword to fly out, which he strapped to his left side. Next came the Golden Crow Sword, which he placed on his other side. After that came three more flying swords, which he strapped to his back. Finally was the Divine Crane Shield, which he attached to his forearm.However, he still didn\u2019t feel at ease. After putting on the bracelet from Li Qinghou, he stuck his chin out and began to walk forward solemnly. Clanging and clattering, he walked out of his log cabin.Outside, he could hear the sound of bells ringing. After taking a few steps, he suddenly remembered something, and quickly slapped his bag of holding to produce a long spear, which he held in hand.The wind blowing his hair up, he left his courtyard.From a distance, he almost looked like a ball. He had a huge wok on his back, a long spear in his hand, and had flying swords strapped here and there. It was quite a sight.As he walked along, countless Outer Sect disciples of Fragrant Cloud Peak saw him and were shocked.The ringing of bells grew more intense, causing the hearts of countless Outer Sect disciples to begin to pound. There were even some Inner Sect disciples who made their way to Mount Daoseed to watch the proceedings.As Bai Xiaochun made his way along, more and more Outer Sect disciples joined him. Xu Baocai was among their number, and he took the lead in the cheering.\u201cSect Uncle Bai is beyond amazing! He\u2019s a hero of the ages!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s definitely gonna win! Definitely!\u201d Quite a large group of Outer Sect disciples crowded around him, fans who took it upon themselves to escort him along his way. One of the most prominent was Hou Xiaomei, whose voice rose up above the others as she cheered.Bai Xiaochun was quite moved, and nodded magnanimously to the surrounding disciples. Considering how much everyone was cheering him on, he figured he really did need to do something to be worthy of it all\u2026.Chin jutting out, he strutted proudly all the way to Mount Daoseed. The first thing he saw when he got there was the huge battle arena which had been set up, which glittered with the light of an enormous spell formation.Further off in the distance were the various peaks of Mount Daoseed. From within the buildings that dotted their surfaces, quite a few sect elders were emerging and flying over toward the arena.On either side of the arena floor were the stands, which were being filled with numerous Outer Sect disciples. From the look of things, there were tens of thousand of them.On the north side of the arena were the disciples from the north bank, who, generally speaking, seemed a lot more impressive than the south bank disciples. Almost every single one of them had some sort of fierce beast accompanying them.The beasts were all different, but each one had a brutal gleam in its eyes, and none seemed like the type it would be wise to provoke. At the very front of all the north bank disciples was a smaller group consisting of both young men and women. Their expressions were cold, and all seemed to burst with energy.Most conspicuous of the group was a beautiful young woman wearing a long violet gown. Standing next to her was a seven-colored phoenix that seemed even more elegant than Elder Zhou\u2019s phoenixes. It had lightning-like eyes that seemed to look down upon all creation.Next to the young woman was a young man in a long blue robe. He was extremely handsome, and shockingly, had the mark of a red sun on his forehead.Lounging at his feet was an enormous dog, with thick black fur and razor-sharp claws. It even seemed to emanate a golden light.Its long, sharp teeth looked particularly ferocious, and it was large enough to ride as a mount. If it rose to its feet, it would probably be as tall as two people, and seemed shockingly powerful. Clearly, its fleshly body strength was unimaginable.The young man with the mark of the red star was none other than one of the north bank\u2019s five great Chosen, Beihan Lie. The huge dog laying at his feet was the famous\u2026 Nightstalker Beast!Near the young man and young woman was another disciple who wore a black robe that covered his face. Only his coldly glittering eyes could be seen, and if one looked closely enough, it was possible to see venomous insects squirming around inside of them!The mere sight of these Chosen caused the disciples of the south bank to tremble in fear.As for all the north bank disciples\u2026 they looked across the battle arena scornfully at the south bank disciples!\u201cThe south bank always loses. The only people worth paying attention to are Shangguan Tianyou, Lu Tianlei, and Zhou Xinqi.\u201d\u201cI heard someone else has become famous on the south bank recently. He took first place in the qualifying round. Supposedly he\u2019s a Prestige disciple, and the Junior Brother of the sect leader?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who he is. He\u2019ll be useless against the north bank. We\u2019re the most powerful by far!\u201dThe Outer Sect disciples from the south bank were mostly assembled, and their numbers were clearly fewer than the disciples from the north bank.\u201cThey\u2019re nothing but a bunch of animal trainers and bug lovers. The south bank is going to get revenge this time around for sure!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to make them lose some face!\u201dStanding in front of all the south bank disciples were nine disciples, with Shangguan Tianyou, Lu Tianlei, and Zhou Xinqi being the most prominent among them. There were six others with somber expressions, who seemed to seethe with violence. This group was made up of the Chosen from the south bank, and they were currently staring fiercely at the people from the north bank.It was in the middle of this fierce staring contest that Bai Xiaochun showed up.Shangguan Tianyou instantly looked over at him, as did all of the south bank disciples in the audience. Thoughtful expressions appeared in their eyes, and the conversations immediately died down.Mixed emotions could be seen in Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s icy eyes as looked at Bai Xiaochun, and his heart filled with begrudging defiance.Lu Tianlei looked equally defiant as he glared hatefully at Bai Xiaochun, electricity dancing around him.Zhou Xinqi stood there silently, eyes shining with a strange light, as if she were measuring Bai Xiaochun carefully, trying to determine exactly how much power was contained within his slight frame.People from the north bank also couldn\u2019t help but look over at him. However, he was a stranger to them, and the way he was dressed provoked instant scorn.The north bank Chosen didn\u2019t even deign to pay him any attention.Finding himself to be the center of so much attention made Bai Xiaochun feel a bit embarrassed. Clearing his throat, he stuck his chest out, hefted his spear, and strutted over to stand next to Zhou Xinqi.When he realized that both sides were staring threateningly at each other, his spirits instantly rose.\u201cA staring contest! I\u2019m great at those!\u201d He immediately looked over at the north bank disciples, a very serious expression on his face.In that moment, a breeze picked up, lifting his long hair off of his back. Coupled with the fact that he held a long spear in his hand, he cut quite an impressive figure.As time passed, more people began to fill the stands on either side. A huge sea of people was growing, separated only by the arena floor.Soon, all of the north bank Chosen had arrived. The last one to show up was a young man in a long black robe. He was handsome, but his face was so pale that it seemed to be completely devoid of blood. He came to stand in front of all the other Chosen, where he closed his eyes, an expression of seeming complete disinterest on his face. In the same moment that he closed his eyes, the air around him seemed to twist and distort, as if he were surrounded by countless fierce ghosts, arisen from the shadows of hell.About this time, beams of light flew toward the battle arena from both the north and south banks. Among them were the seven peak lords from the seven mountain peaks.Elder Zhou was also there, accompanied by an arrogant phoenix which flew around him. When the phoenix saw Bai Xiaochun, it looked at him with a very supercilious glare.Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong was also in the group. After everyone had gathered, he looked at the disciples from the north and south banks, then said, \u201cThe joint south and north bank Outer Sect Chosen battles were last won by the north bank. As such, they may send twelve disciples into battle.\u201cAs the previous loser, the south bank may only send ten people into battle.\u201cThere will be a total of twenty-two competitors. Opponents will be chosen by drawing lots. The goal of the competition is to select the top ten disciples, as well as\u2026 the number one disciple!\u201cWe are here to help each other learn and grow, so killing is not permitted. After every round, you will be given three incense sticks\u2019 worth of time to recover. If your opponent concedes, you must immediately cease fighting. The competition will be presided over by Ouyang Jie from the Hall of Justice.\u201cPerform well. Four prime elders will be observing the battle with divine sense\u2026. And now, let the Outer Sect Chosen battles\u2026 begin!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

These people seemed powerful enough to kill everyone present in body and soul with little more than a glance. Everyone felt that way, including Bai Xiaochun, Shangguan Tianyou, and even the Chosen from the north bank. All of them trembled under the pressure, and yet at the same time, their eye shone with excitement.The fact that there would be prime elders observing the battle with divine sense caused all of the competitors\u2019 eyes to shine brightly.\u201cIf I can attract the attention of a prime elder, maybe I could be accepted as an apprentice\u2026.\u201d\u201cI definitely need to put everything on the line in this battle!\u201d Almost immediately, murderous auras sprang up from the disciples on both sides.Bai Xiaochun was the only one who simply stood there blinking.\u201cPrime elders. That\u2019s the same rank as my Master, right? So they\u2019re my Sect Uncles\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but feel proud of himself. His ranking in the sect really was a bit too high. After a moment of thought, he resolved to go visit his Sect Uncles after the Chosen battles were over.It was at this point that Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong swished his sleeve, causing a sphere of light to fly out into the middle of the battle arena. It quickly split up into twenty-two pearls, which then flew out to Bai Xiaochun and all of the other competitors.Bai Xiaochun looked down at the pearl in his hand. \u201cEleven?\u201dHe peered out of the corner of his eye to see if he could spot what number Shangguan Tianyou and the others had gotten, only to find that they were keeping them hidden.At this point, a cold voice suddenly rang out from the balcony above. It was not Zheng Yuandong, but rather, Ouyang Jie from the Hall of Justice. \u201cThe first battle will take place between the disciples holding pearls number one and two. Please step forward!\u201dIn immediate response, a gaunt young man flew out from among the north bank disciples. His expression was cold and arrogant, and his appearance provoked a cheer from the north bank disciples. Although he wasn\u2019t one of the five great Chosen, he was still quite famous.As soon as he stepped onto the battle arena, he called out, \u201cLiu Yun of the north bank!\u201dIn response, Shangguan Tianyou suddenly flew out. \u201cShangguan Tianyou of the south bank!\u201dHe stood there, expression icy, looking like an unsheathed sword. Even the words he spoke seemed to make everything colder.Of course, as soon as Shangguan Tianyou stepped forth, the Outer Sect disciples from the south bank exploded into loud cheering.The gaunt young man\u2019s face flickered; he had never imagined that the first person he would face would be the most famous Chosen from the south bank. Expression unsightly, he took a deep breath and then waved his hand, causing the air around him to distort. At the same time, a huge python appeared, accompanied by an acrid blast of wind. After the python coiled up, it rose nearly three meters into the air.However, in almost the exact same moment that the young man\u2019s wild beast appeared, and before he had time to do anything else, Shangguan Tianyou took a single step forward, his face completely expressionless. Suddenly, he vanished, and when he reappeared, he was right next to the gaunt young man, a sword in his hand, which he placed against the young man\u2019s throat.\u201cYou lose,\u201d he said.A cold feeling washed over the gaunt young man, and an expression of shocked disbelief filled his face as he turned slowly to look at Shangguan Tianyou. He knew instantly that he was no match for this opponent. How could he ever have imagined that he would lose so quickly? Head bowed, he collected his giant python and left the arena.\u201cWe already won the first battle! Hahaha! The south bank is definitely going to win this time around!\u201d\u201cElder Brother Shangguan can definitely contend for first place!\u201dThe south bank side of the arena was in an excited uproar. As for Bai Xiaochun, he stood there blinking. He hadn\u2019t been able to see exactly what Shangguan Tianyou had done, but he could see that he was definitely beyond ordinary when it came to power.Furthermore, two of the streams of divine sense from the prime elders began to pay closer attention to Shangguan Tianyou.The north bank disciples were dumbfounded.\u201cWas that a minor teleportation? Impossible!! What cultivation base does he have? That couldn\u2019t possibly have been teleportation!\u201d\u201cIt was void magic. This guy\u2026 definitely deserves to be known as the south bank\u2019s number one Chosen. Even with a Qi Condensation cultivation base, he can actually use void magic!\u201dThe other competitors from the north bank looked on with flickering expressions. Beihan Lie\u2019s eyes flickered somberly. The Gongsun siblings and Xu Song all had thoughtful expressions.Only the black-robed Ghostfang simply remained in place, his eyes closed.Before the crowd could calm down, Ouyang Jie\u2019s cold voice once again cut through the noise. \u201cSecond battle!\u201dFrom among the north bank Chosen, a rather pudgy young man stepped out. Smiling broadly, he seemed completely innocent and harmless.\u201cXu Song of the north bank,\u201d he said to the disciple emerging from the ranks of the south bank.His opponent was not Lu Tianlei or one of the other famous Chosen. He was from the group of secretive disciples who had only unleashed his power in the qualifying round. He had a long face, and wasn\u2019t very good-looking, but he was aware that the person he was facing was one of the north banks\u2019 five great Chosen.\u201cZhou Feng of the south bank,\u201d he said. Taking a deep breath, he began to rotate his cultivation base. Performing an incantation gesture, he summoned a flying sword. However, before he could send it flying out, a derisive gleam appeared in Xu Song\u2019s eye, and he pushed his hand out in front of him.Rumbling could be heard as a rift opened up directly above Zhou Feng. Then, cracking sounds could be heard as a gigantic crocodilian beast lunged out with lightning speed and gobbled him up in a single bite.His flying sword lost its connection to spiritual power, and clattered down onto the ground.\u201cFighting against Archway Peak disciples and ignoring the air above your head? How very disappointing.\u201d Chuckling, Xu Song turned and walked out of the arena. When he waved his hand behind him, his beast opened its mouth and spat the unconscious Zhou Feng out in front of the stunned disciples of the south bank.Unsightly expressions could be seen, and a few gasps rang out. As for Lu Tianlei and the other Chosen, their hearts trembled.In sharp contrast, the north bank disciples were cheering loudly.Bai Xiaochun was shaken at how terrifying the north bank people were. Their control over beasts was horrifyingly advanced.Soon, the third battle began. The competitor from the north bank was one of their five great Chosen, Gongsun Wan\u2019er. When she saw that her opponent from the south bank wasn\u2019t Zhou Xinqi, but rather one of the other random disciples, she looked a bit disappointed. Waving her hand, she had her seven-colored phoenix spit out a seven-colored mist.When the seven-colored mist enveloped the south bank disciple, he suddenly seemed to go insane. Howling in rage, he began to strike wildly around him, as if fighting an invisible opponent. A moment later, he simply passed out.From beginning to end, all Gongsun Wan\u2019er did was wave her delicate hand. Afterward, she floated off out of the arena. The crowds from the south bank looked fearfully over at the north bank disciples, clearly shaken.\u201cThe only people who can fight Chosen are other true Chosen.\u201d The south bank disciples looked over at Shangguan Tianyou, hope shining in their eyes. Quite a few also looked at Bai Xiaochun the same way.Bai Xiaochun immediately lifted his head high and stuck his chest out. Inwardly, though, he was terrified by what Gongsun Wan\u2019er had just done.\u201cThat wench is even more incredible than Zhou Xinqi,\u201d he thought, his mouth going dry.Next, the fourth battle began. Lu Tianlei flew out into the arena, surrounded by flickering lightning. His opponent from the north bank was the young man in the black robe who hadn\u2019t opened his eyes the entire time. At long last, his eyes opened, and he walked calmly out into the arena.Strangely, no one from the north bank cheered for him at all. Strange expressions could be seen on the disciples\u2019 faces, and as for the other Chosen, they simply took in deep breaths.The crowd from the south bank was a bit shocked by this. As for Lu Tianlei, he kept his eyes glued on the young man.The young man stood there quietly, face absolutely expressionless. When he spoke, his voice didn\u2019t seem to contain even a hint of emotion. \u201cGhostfang of the north bank.\u201d\u201cLu Tianlei of the south bank!\u201d Lu Tianlei took a deep breath. Well aware that he was facing the number one Chosen from the north bank, his eyes began to shine with the desire to do battle. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hold anything back. Even if I tire myself out so much I can\u2019t keep fighting, it will be worth it!\u201dEyes burning with fighting spirit, he let out a powerful shout, causing the sparks around him to explode into a lake of lightning that expanded thirty meters in all directions.At the same time, Ghostfang calmly pointed up into the sky. Instantly, black clouds began to seethe overhead. When the disciples from the north bank saw that, their expressions flickered, some with fear.Howling, Lu Tianlei charged toward Ghostfang, surrounded by lightning.Ghostfang, however, didn\u2019t even respond. He simply stood there, and even went so far as to close his eyes.\u201cAre you looking to die?!\u201d Lu Tianlei roared, feeling somewhat humiliated. After all, self-respect was critical to Chosen. With another roar, he caused the lake of lightning to redouble in size, and burst with even more power than before.However, before he could even get close to Ghostfang, the black clouds up above were seemingly ripped apart, and a claw-like ghost hand reached out. It was enormous, like a huge column stretching down from the clouds, rushing toward Lu Tianlei with incredible speed and shocking pressure.Even before it reached him, Lu Tianlei began to tremble, and then coughed up a mouthful of blood. The lightning around him shattered, and his feet sank into the ground, sending cracks ripping out in all directions.Blood spurted out as wounds opened up all over him, and blood also oozed out of his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. He tried to struggle, but it seemed useless. Soon, his vision began to fade.\u201cNo!!\u201dThe terrifying ghost claw caused the disciples of both the north and south bank to be filled with terror. Their internal spiritual energy seemed to have been removed from their control, and their souls felt like they would be ripped out from their bodies.Up on the balcony, the sect leader and the others looked on with flickering expressions.\u201cFor thousand of years, no one has been able to successfully cultivate Ghosts Haunt the Night. I can\u2019t believe this kid\u2019s cultivation has reached this level!\u201dXu Meixiang\u2019s face suddenly fell. \u201cNot good!\u201dWithout another word, she flew down toward the arena floor at top speed. She arrived in the blink of an eye, whereupon she waved her hand at the ghost claw. Massive rumbling sounds echoed out as the ghost claw was pushed back. However, it didn\u2019t collapse.Blood sprayed out of Lu Tianlei\u2019s mouth, and he collapsed into unconsciousness. Had Xu Meixiang been any slower, he would have been crushed into a bloody pulp, killed in body and soul.Face darkening, Xu Meixiang looked over at Ghostfang.\u201cYou little delinquent. You might have outstanding talent, but you\u2019re far too ruthless. Trying to kill a fellow sect member right in front of us? Are you looking to die or something?!\u201dGhostfang stood there silently for a moment, an odd expression developing on his face, almost as if he weren\u2019t sure exactly how he should react.\u201cI just didn\u2019t realize he would be so weak,\u201d he said, sounding very sincere. With that, he turned to leave the arena floor.Xu Meixiang frowned and looked back up at the balcony above, seemingly a bit apprehensive. Finally, she gave a cold snort, picked up Lu Tianlei, and left. Lu Tianlei would not be able to continue fighting, and in fact, his injuries would take quite some time to recover from.The north bank looked on silently, just as the south bank did.Ghostfang walked back to the same spot he had been standing in, looking very lonely as he closed his eyes again.After a long moment, the disciples of the north bank recovered their composure and began to cheer a bit.\u201cNobody from the south bank is a match for us at all. We\u2019re definitely going to win!\u201d\u201cThey lost three battles already. The first one was just a fluke. I bet they\u2019ll lose all the rest of the battles too.\u201dIn response to the taunting of the north bank, the south bank disciples could only stare furiously. The north bank\u2026 was simply too strong.The south bank had won the first battle, but lost the following three. The top Chosen Lu Tianlei had almost been killed, and by now, the south bank disciples no longer harbored any thoughts of securing their revenge.Shangguan Tianyou glared angrily at Ghostfang. Inwardly, he was trembling, and even felt profound terror rising up in his heart.He wasn\u2019t the only one. The other Chosen from the south bank, even Zhou Xinqi, were deeply shaken. Even if the only person the north bank had on their team was Ghostfang\u2026 they would still wipe the south bank away.\u201cThat was beyond the power of Qi Condensation\u2026. Not even a peak lord could wipe out that ghost hand. Wasn\u2019t that\u2026 one of the ten secret magics of the Spirit Stream Sect, one of only two that can be considered rare to the extreme\u2026 Ghosts Haunt the Night?\u201d\u201cThe only thing that can compare to Ghosts Haunt the Night is\u2026 the Waterswamp Kingdom!\u201dBai Xiaochun had a very serious expression on his face, and his heart was pounding. Ghostfang\u2019s power left him jumpy to the extreme.Eventually, the fifth battle began. The competitor from the north bank left the south bank disciples feeling as bitter as ever. He was one of the five great Chosen, a person who struck most others cold in the heart\u2026 Gongsun Yun.Within his black robe, only his yellow eyes were visible, with insects crawling in and out of them. As he walked out, one of the south bank disciples steeled himself and prepared to fight. Before he could even introduce himself, though, Gongsun Yun\u2019s yes flickered coldly, and he waved his sleeve. Instantly, a buzzing sound could be heard as innumerable black bugs flew out toward the south bank disciple.No matter how the south bank disciple fought, it was useless. He was soon covered with insects; none of his defenses could protect him at all. Soon, they began to bite into him as if to bore into his flesh. It was a shocking sight that not even the crowds from the north bank were used to seeing.\u201cI concede!!\u2019 cried the south bank disciple. He had the feeling that a single thought on the part of his opponent would cause the insects to devour him.Gongsun Yun\u2019s eyes flickered scornfully as he turned to leave. The black bugs receded like tidewaters, landing on Gongsun Yun and crawling up into his sleeves.When Bai Xiaochun saw all of that, his scalp went numb. Even Zhou Xinqi and Shangguan Tianyou felt their hearts sinking.The rest of the south bank disciples couldn\u2019t help but ponder that the north bank seemed too powerful to even contend with. In their minds, the Chosen battles were already over.\u201cWe\u2019re really going to lose\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe north bank\u2026 is so strong!\u201dAt the same time, the north bank disciples were elated.\u201cIt\u2019s like I said before. They won the first battle, but will lose the rest!\u201d\u201cSouth bank? What a joke. They\u2019ll always be beneath the north bank.\u201d\u201cThirty years ago the south bank only got one disciple into the top ten, and it looks\u2026 like it\u2019ll be the same this time!\u201dWhen the south bank disciples heard such talk, they wanted to offer retorts, but couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. The humiliation they felt was overwhelming.After Gongsun Yun left the arena, Ouyang Jie\u2019s voice could once again be heard. \u201cSixth battle. Would the disciples with marbles eleven and twelve please step into the arena!\u201dBai Xiaochun took a deep breath as he looked down at the number eleven marble he held in his hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was handsome to begin with, but his smile made him even more attractive to the countless female disciples who adored him.Patting the ferocious Nightstalker Beast which lounged next to him, he took a step forward. The Nightstalker Beast slowly rose to its feet, eyes shining with mysterious light.Almost as soon as the huge dog began to move, numerous north bank disciples began to cheer.The Nightstalker Beast was roughly three meters tall, heavily muscled, and brimming with seemingly endless power. Its head was huge, and the enormous fangs which protruded from its mouth dripped with saliva. Its long black fur made it seem even more fierce.Its legs were about as thick as an entire person, and had bone spurs sticking out all over them. It crouched down for a moment, then leaped out into the arena, where it threw its head back and roared.The roar became a sound wave that rolled out in all directions. Many beasts belonging to other north bank disciples began to tremble and bow their heads, as if they were in the presence of royalty.All smiles, Beihan Lie walked out and scanned the crowd from the south bank.\u201cBeihan Lie of the north bank. I wonder which fellow disciple I\u2019ll be fighting today?\u201dAt the same time, the huge dog\u2019s saliva splashed down onto the ground, and it looked around with cold, brutal eyes. Its fangs even seemed to grow longer all of a sudden. Anyone who faced such a dog would surely lose their fighting spirit instantly, especially when it licked its lips, which made it look even more ferocious than before.The crowd from the south bank was completely silent as they looked at the group up front, waiting for someone to step out and fight. Bai Xiaochun glanced at Beihan Lie and then the huge dog. After looking up thoughtfully for a moment, an odd expression appeared on his face. Clearing his throat, he proudly took a step forward.Almost immediately, the eyes of numerous south bank disciples came to be fixed on him, and they shone with anticipation. The huge Nightstalker Beast\u2019s shining green eyes also locked onto him.Looking like a powerful hero, Bai Xiaochun stuck his chin out and strode out into the arena. Up above, Elder Zhou\u2019s bird looked down attentively.\u201cBai Xiaochun of the south bank!\u201d As soon as Bai Xiaochun announced himself, the Nightstalker Beast threw its head back and howled, the brutal gleam in its eyes transforming into a murderous aura directed solely at Bai Xiaochun.Beihan Lie took one look at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s getup, and did nothing to conceal the derision in his eyes. \u201cBai Xiaochun? I heard you took first place in the south bank qualifying round, is that right?\u201dAlthough Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart trembled under the murderous gaze of the huge dog, he continued to hold himself like a powerful master, as lofty as a cloud floating in the sky. \u201cYou\u2019re Beihan Lie, right? I\u2019ll give you one chance to concede!\u201dBeihan Lie\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cConcede?\u201dHe threw his head back and laughed uproariously, as if he had just heard the funniest joke in the world. However, a murderous gleam could be seen in his eyes.\u201cVery funny. In all the years, you\u2019re the first Outer Sect disciple who has ever dared to utter such words to me.\u201d Next, he extended his right hand and performed an incantation gesture, taking control of his Nightstalker Beast.Bai Xiaochun sighed. Looking like a lonely hero, he gazed sadly at Beihan Lie and said, \u201cBeihan Lie, this is your last chance to concede. When I attack, I frighten even myself. I\u2019m telling you\u2026 the best thing would be to not force my hand.\u201dThe crowd from the south bank was struck mute. They stared, first at Bai Xiaochun, then at Beihan Lie, and then at the huge, ferocious dog. No matter which way they looked at the situation, Beihan Lie seemed to be far more powerful.However, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words at least put a seed of hope into the hearts of the south bank disciples. And yet, they couldn\u2019t help but remember the unsavory record of his past dealings, which filled their hearts with consternation.As for the north bank audience, they roared with laughter and made all sorts of taunting statements.\u201cIs this guy a moron or what? Elder Brother Beihan is one of the five great Chosen. Although he might not be on the same level as Ghostfang, even Elder Brother Ghostfang has to admit that he\u2019s strong. Who does this Bai Xiaochun think he is? How arrogant!\u201d\u201cNot only is Elder Brother Beihan strong, his Nightstalker Beast has been praised by the elders. It\u2019s the king of beasts, with a powerful fleshly body and boundless energy. Even its howl is enough to shock most people into a daze. Look at this Bai Xiaochun\u2026 he\u2019s so dainty the Nightstalker Beast will probably bite his leg off with a single bite!\u201d\u201cElder Brother Beihan will definitely win this one!\u201dBeihan Lie appeared to be highly amused by Bai Xiaochun. Eyes flashing coldly, he decided that he would teach him a hard, painful lesson. If he didn\u2019t kill him, he would shred his skin off. With that, he performed an incantation gesture to begin the fight.\u201cI\u2019m serious, my attacks frighten even me,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said. Sighing, he slapped his bag of holding to produce two medicinal pills.As that happened, Beihan Lie smiled viciously and finished his incantation gesture. Instantly, the eager Nightstalker Beast howled and began to charge toward Bai Xiaochun.Beihan Lie also burst into motion, flying along, the sun mark on his forehead radiating bright light as he flew toward Bai Xiaochun.However, even as the man and the dog flew toward him, Bai Xiaochun jumped up into the air and sent one of the medicinal pills flying toward the Nightstalker Beast.The Nightstalker Beast\u2019s eyes gleamed as it roared through the air. It obviously could have avoided the medicinal pill, but instead, its expression flickered, and it grabbed the pill and swallowed it down.Instantly, a tremor ran through the huge dog, and its eyes went bloodshot. Rumbling sounds echoed out as it began to grow larger and more muscular.Shockingly, its bone spurs and fangs also grew longer!It began to salivate, and also, something rod-like\u2026 bulged out between its legs!Overall, it looked so ferocious and terrifying that it was difficult to put into words.Its eyes became violet, and it began to pant. Mind muddled, it dug its claws into the ground, threw its head back, and let out a shocking howl, the sound of which caused the south bank disciples in the audience to gasp.\u201cWhat\u2026 what kind of medicinal pill was that!?!?\u201d\u201cHold on, why does that dog\u2019s posture seem so familiar\u2026?\u201dThe disciples on the north bank were looking on with wide eyes. The changes in the Nightstalker Beast were obvious, and somehow, it now seemed even more terrifying than before. Not only was it stronger in terms of its fleshly body, it also seemed even more maddened than before. The north bank disciples were greatly shocked.\u201cThat medicinal pill is so effective!\u201d\u201cIt can actually make wild beasts even more wild!!\u201dThe audience was astonished, and so was Beihan Lie, who was unsure of exactly what was happening. Although the Nightstalker Beast was obviously a lot more powerful than before, he had the sinking feeling that something was wrong.\u201cI\u2019ll warn you one more time,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said coolly, sticking his jaw out. \u201cConcede.\u201dBeihan Lie\u2019s eyes shone with murderous light. \u201cI\u2019d only planned to break one of your arms, but since you\u2019re trying to act so mysterious, I think I\u2019ll break all of your limbs instead!\u201dAlthough taking lives was prohibited in the Chosen battles, serious injuries were often unavoidable. Even as the words left his mouth, he continued his charge toward Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun sighed and waved his right hand, sending one of his Pheromone Pills out toward Beihan Lie.Afterward, he fell back at top speed until he was at the edge of the arena, where he stood nervously, looking at Beihan Lie.Beihan Lie\u2019s pupils constricted, and just when he was about to dodge out of the way, the pill detonated, transforming into a powder that filled the area. Even though he tried to avoid it, some of it happened to get on him.His expression flickered. Assuming it was a poison pill, he fell back and quickly examined himself. However, he found nothing out of the ordinary except for a somewhat pleasant aroma.A frown appeared on his face. The situation only seemed to be getting stranger and stranger. Just when he was going to attempt to end the battle once and for all, a howl split the air.It was none other than the Nightstalker Beast, which turned toward Beihan Lie, panting, its eyes shining bright red.Beihan Lie\u2019s heart began to pound, and just when he was about to try to exert control over the dog, a terrifying roar shook everything, and the Nightstalker Beast began to charge in his direction. Its speed was incredible, giving Beihan Lie absolutely no time to dodge. Instantly, the Nightstalker Beast pounced on him.\u201cDammit, are you crazy!?!? What are you doing?!\u201d Beihan Lie\u2019s face darkened, and he roared in fury, but the huge dog had him pinned tight. Because of the maddened Nightstalker Beast, Beihan Lie couldn\u2019t move a muscle. Furthermore, he suddenly had a very terrifying premonition, and his face went pale.At the same time, the Outer Sect disciples in the audience couldn\u2019t help but crane their necks to see what was happening. Even the peak lords and elders were watching closely, and the divine sense belonging to the prime elders was focused intently on the scene.Next, everyone gasped as\u2026 Beihan Lie began to let out miserable shrieks!\u201cNo\u2026 NO\u2026 YOU!! AIIIEEE!!!\u201d Beihan Lie\u2019s bloodcurdling screams could shake heaven and earth. His expression was that of pain and confusion, as though he couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. Trembling, he could do nothing but scream.The north bank disciples were in an uproar, and could hardly believe what they were seeing. Panting, their eyes filled with unprecedented fear and terror.\u201cHeavens!! What medicinal pill is that? It isn\u2019t turning the dog crazy, it\u2019s turning the dog\u2026 on!\u201d\u201cTh-this\u2026 this\u2026.\u201d\u201cElder Brother Beihan is\u2026 being done by his battle beast?!\u201dBeihan Lie struggled frantically, and let out constant, desperate screams. What was happening now would become a legend the likes of which had never existed in the Spirit Stream Sect.Even Ghostfang was watching with wide eyes, trembling in utter disbelief.As for the south bank disciples, their minds were spinning, and they could hardly think straight. Shangguan Tianyou stared blankly, suddenly feeling as if the world were a much darker place than before. Zhou Xinqi, on the other hand, was blushing fiercely.Bai Xiaochun stood off to the side, just as shaken as everyone else. This was his first time using his Aphrodisiac Pill in battle, and he had never imagined that the results would be so astonishing\u2026. As he watched the screaming Beihan Lie, he couldn\u2019t hold back from sighing.Sounding very innocent, he said, \u201cLike I said, even I am frightened by my attacks. I told you several times, but you\u2026 just insisted on doing things your way.\u201dIt was at this point that an enraged roar filled the air as Beihan Lie\u2019s Master finally intervened. \u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201dMurderous aura raging, he leaped forward, flicking his sleeve to send the Nightstalker Beast spinning away off into the distance. Then he picked up Beihan Lie, who by this point had absolutely no face left. The Master almost felt as if what had just occurred wasn\u2019t even real. Too embarrassed to stay, he glared angrily at Bai Xiaochun and then departed.As for Beihan Lie, the mental and physical injuries he had sustained caused him to close his eyes and lapse into a coma. It was impossible to say when he would have the face to appear in public again. The pain he was in was like a living nightmare.\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The only thing they could think about was what had just occurred with Beihan Lie and his huge dog\u2026.They weren\u2019t the only flabbergasted ones; the sect leader, peak lords, and other elders were all struck mute. All they could do was stare down into the arena at the innocent-looking Bai Xiaochun.Elder Zhou sat there trembling, his eyes bulging, mixed emotions written on his face\u2026. As for the phoenix soaring in the air above, it let out a few piercing cries, as if to remind everyone that it had been tainted by Bai Xiaochun long ago.Eventually, the sound of breathing could be heard, and the south bank Outer Sect disciples began to turn and look at Bai Xiaochun with strange expressions on their faces.The female disciples were all blushing, and some even spat in contempt at him.However, the male disciples were even more profoundly affected. Without exception, they all edged away from Bai Xiaochun, sweat popping out on their foreheads as sympathy for Beihan Lie rose up in their hearts.Eventually, the crowd devolved into a hubbub.\u201cSect\u2026 Sect Uncle Bai\u2026 is a god!! That Beihan Lie\u2026 will probably never recover from this injury\u2026.\u201d\u201cNever, EVER provoke Sect Uncle Bai. He\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s a complete menace!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that the same medicinal pill he fed to Elder Zhou\u2019s phoenix? It\u2019s basically an aphrodisiac for beasts\u2026. I can\u2019t think of any possible reason why Sect Uncle Bai\u2026 would concoct something like that!\u201dRegardless of the methods used, Bai Xiaochun had won a victory for the south bank, only the second one so far. Although the south bank disciples weren\u2019t really sure how to feel at the moment, they began to cheer for Bai Xiaochun.Shangguan Tianyou wiped the sweat off his brow. He might have looked down on Bai Xiaochun with contempt before, but now he couldn\u2019t help but gasp. When he thought back to Beihan Lie\u2019s cruel fate, he couldn\u2019t help but imagine what it would have been like if he had been in the same position\u2026. After a moment, he cast such thoughts aside.Zhou Xinqi was tongue-tied, her mind spinning.Moments later, though, an even greater commotion could be heard, something like the rumble of thunder. The north bank disciples erupted in unprecedented fashion; it didn\u2019t matter that they had won so many battles in the competition so far, and in such amazing fashion. Now, everything had changed.All of the north bank disciples, even the Inner Sect disciples who had come to observe the battles, were all incensed. Eyes bloodshot, they shouted out at the tops of their lungs.\u201cDemented!! What medicinal pill is that? Dammit! How can a pill like that even exist in the world? I\u2019m gonna exterminate Bai Xiaochun and destroy that pill!!\u201d\u201cHeavens! Elder Brother Beihan\u2019s own beast pounced on him! This\u2026 this\u2026.\u201d\u201cTake Bai Xiaochun down! Nobody has insulted the north bank like this in countless years!! That medicinal pill should be banned! Any of them that exist should be completely destroyed!!\u201dIt was impossible for them not to be enraged. Even the male disciples from the south bank sympathized with Beihan Lie, much less those from the north bank, who felt his pain even more\u2026. After all, every north bank disciple had a battle beast of some sort. Even as they shouted out in range, they subconsciously glanced down at their various respective battle beasts, and thought of Beihan Lie. They couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy as a result.Soon, their maddened shouts grew even more extreme.\u201cBai Xiaochun is the archenemy of the north bank!!\u201d\u201cDown with Bai Xiaochun! The north bank will endure eternal humiliation as long as he lives!!\u201d\u201cDammit! I\u2019m gonna kill him! I\u2019m gonna exterminate him! He\u2019s stained the north bank for all eternity!!\u201d It was easy to imagine how in the future, every time the north bank disciples looked at their own battle beasts, they would think about the tragedy of Beihan Lie.The Gongsun siblings\u2019 breath came in ragged pants as they looked at Bai Xiaochun, their eyes shining with unprecedented fear, as well as rage. Although Beihan Lie had been the one to receive the injury, the entire north bank was hurt.As for Xu Song, all the fat on his body trembled, and his expression was one of fury. Although he never got along with Beihan Lie, he couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for him. Deep inside, he felt sympathy, and even more so, terror.\u201cBeihan Lie could only control one battle beast\u2026. I\u2026 I have five\u2026.\u201d When he thought about that, Xu Song almost cried. Gnashing his teeth, he glared at Bai Xiaochun with furious, bloodshot eyes.Even the black-robed Ghostfang trembled, a look of intense seriousness in his eyes as he stared at Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun looked around innocently at the hornet\u2019s nest he had stirred up. When he saw how mad the north bank disciples were getting, he quickly tried to offer an explanation.\u201cHey, don\u2019t blame me. Before the fighting even started, I told Beihan Lie to concede. He didn\u2019t listen. I made it clear\u2026 that even I\u2019m afraid of my own attacks!\u201d Bai Xiaochun really felt that he was being given the short end of the stick. However, his explanations did nothing except pour fuel onto the fire.\u201cBai Xiaochun!? I can\u2019t believe you have a name like that! Dammit! You\u2019re not pure at all!!\u201d 1\u201cCompletely shameless! Despicable! How dare you continue to humiliate us!!\u201d\u201cTake Bai Xiaochun down!!\u201dThe enraged north bank disciples began to edge forward, eyes bloodshot. From the look of it, tens of thousands of disciples were all about to charge onto the arena floor to take Bai Xiaochun out.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart began to thump, and he quickly retreated a few steps closer to the south bank audience. Sighing, he stuck his chin out, waved his sleeve, and stood there like a lonely hero.\u201cI am pure and good, no matter how anybody tries to smear me,\u201d he said. Sighing, he finally left the arena floor. Behind him, countless north bank disciples were shouting in fury and staring daggers. If looks could kill, Bai Xiaochun would be dead many, many times over already.He coughed dryly as he returned to the south bank side. Strange expressions could be seen on the faces of the disciples there; by this point, they could sense the intense anger the north bank felt toward him, and it was terrifying.As of this moment, the true enemy of the north bank wasn\u2019t the south bank, it was a single person. Bai Xiaochun!It was easy to imagine how, even if the north bank won the competition, because of Beihan Lie, they would consider it a loss\u2026.The sect leader sat awkwardly up on the balcony, glaring down at Bai Xiaochun, his heart pounding with helplessness. He couldn\u2019t help but muse that whenever Bai Xiaochun showed up, it didn\u2019t matter how solemn the occasion was, the atmosphere would quickly devolve\u2026. As for the three peak lords from the south bank, none of them were quite sure what expression was appropriate. They had never encountered a situation like this in their entire lives\u2026.Li Qinghou\u2019s complexion flickered between green and red, and his eyes were blank. He had been completely shaken by what just occurred. Even the four prime elders on the peak of Mount Daoseed felt their divine sense shaking, and they weren\u2019t sure exactly what to think or feel.Seeing that the anger of the north bank disciples was almost beyond control, Ouyang Jie suddenly spoke out in a voice which swept out and physically pushed the north bank disciples back.\u201cLet the seventh battle begin!\u201d Instantly, a burly man flew out from among the north bank forces. His eyes were bright red as he landed on the arena floor, where he let out a roar of rage.\u201cBai Xiaochun, I challenge you to fight!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see if you can get into the top ten,\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied, sticking his chin out like a lonely hero. \u201cThen maybe you\u2019ll qualify to fight me.\u201d The burly man howled in fury, his eyes completely bloodshot. At the same time, the disciple standing next to Shangguan Tianyou braced himself and walked out onto the arena floor.Booms echoed out. The north bank disciples had gone mad\u2026 and this burly man, the first to fight after Bai Xiaochun\u2019s performance, was clearly venting his anger by fighting. The south bank disciple was pushed backward over and over again until he finally conceded.Next were the eighth and ninth battles\u2026. The north bank disciples might as well have been slaughtering chickens. They fought with enraged madness, their hearts bursting with anger. All of them wanted to get into the top ten to have a chance to fight Bai Xiaochun and cleanse the stain of humiliation!\u201cI have to win! Once I\u2019m in the top ten, I\u2019ll take Bai Xiaochun down. Then we\u2019ll see how he likes to get pounced on by a wild beast!\u201d\u201cFudge! Even if I have to break the damn sect rules, I\u2019m going to cripple him!\u201d\u201cEven if I kill him, my Master won\u2019t punish me too badly. Anybody that kills Bai Xiaochun will be a hero to the north bank!\u201d The north bank disciples used every means at their disposal in the fighting.Because the north bank had two more people on their team than the south bank, the tenth battle was fought between two north bank disciples. However, they didn\u2019t go easy on each other.Soon, the final battle of the first round had arrived. Zhou Xinqi took a deep breath and walked out onto the arena floor, violet light flickering around her feet. Moments later, she began to fight the final north bank disciple.The battle was not shocking or amazing. Zhou Xinqi was a Chosen, and although the north bank disciple she fought was extraordinary, he couldn\u2019t compare to her at all. After only ten breaths of time passed, the north bank disciple coughed up a mouthful of blood and begrudgingly conceded.As Zhou Xinqi walked back to the team, the south bank disciples erupted into cheering. When Bai Xiaochun heard it, he felt a bit sour inwardly. The cheering for Zhou Xinqi was clearly much louder than the cheering had been for him.As of this moment, the first round of the Chosen battles was over. Eleven disciples remained; eight from the north bank, and three from the south bank!\u2014Translator: Deathblade. Chinese language consultant: ASI a.k.a. Beerblade. Editor: GNE.

As everyone sat there, the north bank disciples bristled, glaring angrily\u2026 at Bai Xiaochun!The contestants were all itching to begin the second round, in which they would do anything possible to take Bai Xiaochun out. By now, none of them cared whether or not the north bank won in the end; they merely wanted to shed his blood to wash away their humiliation!\u201cBai Xiaochun, in the second round, I\u2019m going to make you pay a horrifying price for humiliating the north bank!\u201d\u201cHe should be given to an entire pack of beasts to ease our hatred. This second round will be the most painful experience of his life!\u201d\u201cTake Bai Xiaochun down! Take this shameless bastard down!\u201dThe north bank cared about nothing but taking out Bai Xiaochun, and that responsibility was given to the eight people who had made it through the first round. Although Ghostfang simply sat there with his eyes closed, the other seven glared angrily at Bai Xiaochun with clenched fists.They represented all of the other disciples of the north bank, and were now analyzing what they had learned about him from his previous performance. All of them were coming up with their own ways of dealing with him.\u201cAll Bai Xiaochun has are some medicinal pills. As long as he doesn\u2019t have a chance to use them, he can be dealt with easily!\u201d\u201cHe only won because of those medicinal pills. Without them, exterminating him will be as easy as turning over your hand. He\u2019ll definitely be defeated in the second round. Defeated, and defeated ruthlessly!\u201dAs far as Bai Xiaochun was concerned, the north bank disciples were acting like bullies. He\u2019d won, hadn\u2019t he? As for the brutality of that victory\u2026 he wanted to say something in his defense, but was worried that if he said the wrong thing, it would only make things worse. Much worse.\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d he thought.As the north bank stewed in their anger, the south bank disciples didn\u2019t say much either. They simply sat there bristling until Ouyang Jie finally spoke.\u201cThree incense sticks have burned. The second round of the Chosen battles will now begin, and the top six will be selected!\u201cOf the eleven of you, one will sit out of the fighting and directly enter the top six. The other ten will draw lots and fight each other in twos to proceed!\u201d Accompanying Ouyang Jie\u2019s words, a beam of light shot out over the arena floor, which transformed into a glowing sphere, roughly three meters in diameter. In turn, the pearls in the hands of Bai Xiaochun and the other remaining contestants were tugged toward it. Upon releasing the pearls, they flew directly toward the glowing sphere.Once inside, new numbers appeared on their surfaces, from one to ten, with one of the pearls being blank.The eleven pearls began to rotate inside the sphere, moving faster and faster until they were nothing more than a blur.\u201cA secret magic is at work here to ensure complete and utter fairness,\u201d explained Ouyang Jie. \u201cNot even I can interfere with the pearls. Rest at ease as you take the marbles back to decide the order of fighting.\u201dXu Song glared at Bai Xiaochun and then chuckled coldly. \u201cBai Xiaochun, you\u2019d better pray that you don\u2019t fight me. I\u2019ll crush you like a twig!\u201dWith that, he waved his hand, causing a pearl to fly out into his hand.One of the other north bank Chosen gritted his teeth and coldly said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who you face, you\u2019re definitely going to lose painfully in the second round!\u201dWith that, he and everyone else, Bai Xiaochun included, made grasping motions to secure their pearls.Instantly, ten pearls flew out toward the group of contestants.\u201cI have number three!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m number seven!\u201d\u201cI got number one!\u201d When the north bank disciples got their pearls, they announced the numbers. Soon, the order of fighting was becoming clear. After they announced their numbers, they looked ferociously toward Bai Xiaochun.Eventually, Ghostfang got his pearl and coolly said, \u201cNumber nine!\u201dThe north bank disciples soon found that not a single one of their number had acquired the blank pearl. As of this moment, the only pearls left were numbers four and ten, as well as the blank pearl. The north bank disciples began to look nervously over at the south bank.\u201cI\u2019m number four!\u201d Shangguan Tianyou announced coolly.\u201cNumber ten!\u201d Zhou Xinqi said, her face somewhat unsightly. As soon as the words left her mouth, she looked over at Ghostfang.By now, everyone\u2019s fighting spot had been determined, with the exception of Bai Xiaochun. Strange expressions appeared on the faces of the south bank audience, especially the Fragrant Cloud Peak disciples, who had been there to watch Bai Xiaochun fight in the smaller competition. Their eyes went as wide as saucers.\u201cNo way\u2026.\u201d they thought incredulously.Even more incredulous than them were the north bank disciples, who so badly wanted to teach him a lesson. Fists clenched, the entire group stared blankly at Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t keep from looking a bit proud. The pearl in his hand had no number on it whatsoever. At first, he\u2019d thought that he might have seen incorrectly. However, after closer examination, he confirmed that it was indeed blank. Then he looked around and realized that everyone was staring at him, and suddenly, he realized how lonely life could be sometimes\u2026. Flicking his sleeve, he assumed the manner of a lonely hero, staring up into the clouds. Voice cool, he said, \u201cMy apologies. I\u2019ll be sitting this round out. If you want to fight me, you\u2019ll have to work hard to get to the next round.\u201dHis words were met with a moment of silence. A few breaths\u2019 worth of time passed, and then the north bank audience erupted into enraged shouting.\u201cImpossible! Dammit, he\u2019s sitting the round out!? Why did it have to be him, the shameless Bai Xiaochun. Why?!?!\u201d\u201cHow could he be so lucky!? Out of eleven people, I can\u2019t believe that he gets to sit the round out!! How could someone like him have luck like this!? It\u2019s preposterous!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t take this. What an absolute show-off! I HAVE to take him down!!\u201dThe north bank disciples had intended to wash their humiliation clean with violence, but now that Bai Xiaochun was sitting the round out, they very nearly coughed up mouthfuls of blood. It was almost like they had just tried to punch Bai Xiaochun in the face, but ended up striking nothing but air. Frustration fermenting inside of them, Xu Song and the others stared at Bai Xiaochun as if they wished they could rip him to pieces right then and there.Even the south bank disciples looked on with odd expressions, unsure of what to say. It was already obvious that the north bank disciples wanted to fight Bai Xiaochun more than anything else, so it wasn\u2019t even necessary to ponder how they felt regarding this sudden development.\u201cThat\u2019s nothing!\u201d blurted out a random Fragrant Cloud Peak disciple. \u201cBack in the minor competition, Sect Uncle Bai\u2026 sat out for two rounds in a row!\u201d When the people sitting around him heard that, their eyes went wide with disbelief.\u201cThis happened to him before? Sect Uncle Bai\u2019s luck\u2026 is unbelievable!\u201dBai Xiaochun cleared his throat, and yet again assumed the posture of a lonely hero. Looking over at the north bank side, he slowly shook his head. That, of course, made the north bank even angrier.However, getting angrier didn\u2019t change the situation at all. They had no option but to stifle their feelings as the second round of the Chosen battles began.Unfortunately, without Bai Xiaochun fighting, the entire affair was a lot less interesting. Furthermore, the south bank only had two disciples in the mix, which meant that three of the battles would involve disciples from the north bank fighting each other.The first battle was just such a situation. Gongsun Wan\u2019er fought one of the other north bank disciples, and defeated him effortlessly. The defeated disciple trudged off of the arena floor, looking over his shoulder at the south bank side, mixed emotions playing across his face.The second battle saw Shangguan Tianyou take the field. Luckily for him, he didn\u2019t face one of the top Chosen, but another random disciple, whom he defeated as easily as blowing some dust off of his shoulder. The south bank audience breathed sighs of relief. At least\u2026 they had secured victory in one fight.Next, the north bank again fought itself in the third and fourth battles. Although the fighting was intense, the fact that the south bank wasn\u2019t involved at all ensured that the disciples that were from there simply looked on silently.In the final battle, Zhou Xinqi walked out with a serious expression on her face. Although the south bank disciples cheered, they weren\u2019t too optimistic about the outcome of the battle.After all, Zhou Xinqi\u2019s opponent\u2026 was the terrifying Ghostfang, who had almost killed Lu Tianlei with the single wave of a finger.After stepping out onto the arena floor, Ghostfang curiously asked, \u201cBetween you and that lightning guy, who\u2019s stronger?\u201dSensing that his intention was not to humiliate her, Zhou Xinqi answered honestly: \u201cElder Brother Lu is a bit stronger.\u201d\u201cHow about this\u2026.\u201d Ghost replied quietly. \u201cI used seventy percent power last time. This time, I\u2019ll only use forty percent. You probably won\u2019t get killed by that.\u201d Those who could hear him looked on with bitter smiles, convinced that Ghostfang was being honest.Zhou Xinqi took a deep breath and then performed a double-handed incantation gesture. Instantly, countless blue sparks appeared around her, forming numerous blue flying silks. The flying silks then merged together into something that resembled a huge flower, that pulsed with a powerful gravitational force!\u201cPlant Transformation Incantation!\u201d When the crowd from the south bank saw the Plant Transformation Incantation being used, their eyes glittered. Although it wasn\u2019t quite on the same level as Ghosts Haunt the Night or the Waterswamp Kingdom, it was one of the ten secret magics of the sect.It was a unique magic that used plants against the enemy, with numerous variations that made it enigmatic and unpredictable. When Li Qinghou used it, he could create a world of plants and vegetation 50 kilometers wide. The final upgraded version of the secret magic had another name\u2026 Magic Plant Soldiers!Using the magic was such a drain on Zhou Xinqi\u2019s energy that her face went pale. She knew that she wasn\u2019t a match for this opponent, but in her world, it wasn\u2019t an option to just concede without trying.The wave of her hand caused the blue flower to tremble, and then grow larger at a rapid rate, simultaneously shooting toward Ghostfang. It almost looked like the flower was opening wide to consume him.It was a spectacular sight that instantly attracted the attention of Bai Xiaochun, who found the magical technique particularly interesting. However, it was at this point that Ghostfang looked up calmly and then waved his finger.This time, he didn\u2019t wave his finger at the sky, but at Zhou Xinqi. The air next to him began to vibrate, and a huge black ghost claw appeared, which quickly clenched into a fist!The huge fist filled half of the arena floor, and was so big people couldn\u2019t see anything else. It smashed into the blue flower, which trembled and then collapsed into ashes. The ghost claw, however, didn\u2019t stop. It continued on as if nothing had happened, smashing directly into Zhou Xinqi.A massive boom echoed out, and blood sprayed out of Zhou Xinqi\u2019s mouth as she tumbled backward. She was knocked out of the arena floor, and when she finally ground to a halt, she coughed up eight mouthfuls of blood. Face pale, she looked up with a stubborn gleam in her eyes to see Ghostfang turning and walking away.Everything was silent except for the gasps that echoed out\u2026.\u2014Translator: Deathblade.

At a certain point, Baby Deathblade became the center of attention in the mall. Eventually, one of the people said (in Chinese), \u201cHe\u2019s so cute. His mother is probably Chinese, right?\u201d At that point, everyone looked over at Beerblade, assuming that because he\u2019s Chinese, he would provide an answer.

He must be the strongest disciple under Foundation Establishment!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the ultimate battle prowess of the Qi Condensation stage! He\u2019s definitely reached the realm of will. Only by possessing a mysterious and unfathomable will can someone produce such terrifying power!\u201dIt was almost as if no one dared to speak in a loud voice. The north bank Chosen looked on with mixed emotions. After all, no one would be happy to have someone so powerful appear among their generation. On the south bank side, Shangguan Tianyou stood there silently, his heart anything but calm. Watching Ghostfang defeat the other Chosen was just like watching a Chosen defeat ordinary disciples.It was more than clear that Ghostfang existed on a totally different plane than even the other Chosen.Bai Xiaochun was left trembling. He had only seen Ghostfang make two attacks, and yet each one had been completely astonishing.By this point, the top six had been selected. The north bank had four, and the south bank had two. They were Shangguan Tianyou, Bai Xiaochun, Ghostfang, the Gongsun siblings, and Xu Song.Those disciples who were familiar with the Chosen battles knew that the next round, round three, would be the final round. The matches to follow, and the resulting victories and defeats, would determine the final ranking of the top six disciples!Anyone who could secure five victories would naturally take first place!During the past thousand years, the north bank had always swept the south bank and taken the top spots. Furthermore, the south bank disciples all knew that Ghostfang\u2026 was exactly the type of person who could defeat everyone else. He was simply too powerful.The south bank audience sat there quietly. If Ghostfang weren\u2019t in the picture, they might hold hope that Shangguan Tianyou could take first place.\u201cSecond place isn\u2019t bad though\u2026.\u201d That was what many of the south bank disciples were thinking as they sat there sighing. Some of them looked over at Bai Xiaochun. Many had a hard time determining exactly what they thought of him, but regardless of the specifics, he hadn\u2019t given any of them the impression that he was a fighter. In fact, he hadn\u2019t fought anyone since joining the sect.The only thing they did know for certain was that he had come back alive after the Luochen Clan tried to chase him down and kill him\u2026.Many of the south bank disciples had already resigned themselves to the fact that the south bank had lost, both in terms of the number of disciples who made it into the top ten, and also the first place spot.In contrast, the north bank disciples were getting excited. Their eyes shone with anticipation and ferocity as they glared at Bai Xiaochun.\u201cThe rules for the top six probably haven\u2019t changed. This time, Bai Xiaochun is definitely going to be hurting!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. According to the rules, everyone will fight once with all the other disciples. That means\u2026 that four blazing suns from the north bank will all have a chance to pummel him. Finally, the humiliation our north bank has endured will be avenged!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just the ordinary north bank disciples who were musing in such a way. Xu Song and the Gongsun siblings were all chuckling coldly as they stared at Bai Xiaochun, determined to come out victorious.Bai Xiaochun shrunk back a bit. Looking over at the furious north bank disciples, he shook his head a bit helplessly. \u201cImmortal cultivation is supposed to be about living forever. What\u2019s the point of all the fighting and killing\u2026?\u201dIt was at this point that Ouyang Jie\u2019s voice finally rang out. \u201cThe third round of the Chosen battles will follow the same rules as before. Victory will be given to whoever takes the most wins. The first set of matches will be Shangguan Tianyou versus Xu Song, Ghostfang versus Gongsun Yun, and Bai Xiaochun versus Gongsun Wan\u2019er. These fights will be carried out simultaneously!\u201dWith that, a beam of light descended from the balcony onto the arena floor, dividing it into three areas. Sealing barriers immediately sprang up to separate them.Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s eyes flickered brightly as he dashed out into the first battle zone. At the same time, Xu Song also flew out. The two of them locked eyes, both of their expressions grave.They wasted no time on words. Xu Song waved his hand, and three fierce beasts materialized around him. Each one was unique, but they were all incredibly ferocious in appearance. Even as they began to charge Shangguan Tianyou, a huge crocodilian mouth appeared above him, which closed in to consume him.In addition to all that, the ground beneath his feet cracked as numerous tentacles burst out.Meanwhile, Ghostfang strode forward into the second battle zone. Off to the side, Gongsun Yun stood there quietly. Although the bugs which writhed in his eyes were powerful, he knew that he was no match for Ghostfang. Despite that, he wasn\u2019t willing to simply concede.\u201cEven if you were more powerful than you already are, I\u2019d still want to fight you!\u201d Taking a deep breath, he joined Ghostfang in the second battle zone.Gongsun Wan\u2019er snorted coldly as she stepped forward, glaring at Bai Xiaochun.Of all the disciples present, Bai Xiaochun feared her the least, so he tromped forward to the third battle zone, meeting her gaze with his own glare.As Bai Xiaochun walked out, the north bank disciples heckled him furiously. Completely ignoring the other two battle zones, their attention and fury was directed solely upon Bai Xiaochun.\u201cElder Sister Gongsun, eradicate that damned Bai Xiaochun!\u201d\u201cKill him!\u201dGongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s eyes flickered with cold light. Instead of summoning her seven-colored phoenix, she performed an incantation gesture and then tapped down on her forehead. Seven-colored light immediately sprang out from within her, accompanied by a frigid blast of cold air which covered the ground in frost.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you concede?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, blinking. \u201cWhen I attack, I frighten even myself.\u201dAlmost immediately, an image popped up in Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s mind of Beihan Lie\u2019s tragic fate, and her face flushed. At the same time, a murderous aura rose up within her.\u201cShut up, you perv. I\u2019m gonna make you pay a heavy price for what you\u2019ve done!\u201d With the wave of a hand, she summoned an ice blade which then shot toward Bai Xiaochun.Bai Xiaochun shrugged helplessly. He had merely been telling the truth, and wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d been called a perv. Sighing, he slapped his bag of holding, causing countless talismans to appear, which he began to slap down all over his body.Rumbling sounds could then be heard as numerous shields sprang up. Soon, they were nearly three meters thick, glittering with multicolored light. It was a shocking sight, and yet, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t finished yet. Next, he produced the Divine Crane Shield, which glittered brightly as it produced yet another shield layer.Then there was the bracelet Li Qinghou had given him. As soon as he activated it, it spread out to cover his entire body, turning him pitch black.Considering he was also wearing a big black wok on his back, Bai Xiaochun looked\u2026 completely eye-catching.Furthermore, the speed and ease with which he activated all of his defenses made it obvious that he was very familiar with doing so\u2026.The north bank disciples\u2019 eyes widened, and they watched blankly as the ice blades slammed into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s shields, breaking some of them, but eventually shattering.Bai Xiaochun remained inside, completely unharmed.If that were all there were to it, it might not be a big deal, but what was most infuriating was that Bai Xiaochun merely stood there, hands clasped behind his back, chin sticking out, looking up at the clouds like a hero.\u201cToo weak,\u201d he said, flicking his sleeve and then placing his hands behind his back again. \u201cBut then again, I\u2019ve never met anyone who could break through all of my shields.\u201dGongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s eyes seemed to be on the verge of popping out of her skull. She had fought many people in her life, but had never met anyone so adept in using defensive shields. Bai Xiaochun was the first.She could see that he had dozens of ordinary shields protecting him, plus the Divine Crane Shield, the black substance covering his skin, the huge wok on his back, and numerous leather jackets. She was left feeling annoyed, uneasy, and even a bit taken aback.The north bank audience wasn\u2019t happy either.\u201cCompletely shameless!! I can\u2019t believe he has so many defensive talismans and magical items. Dammit! These are the Chosen battles, not the resource battles!\u201d\u201cElder Sister Gongsun has to wipe him out. I\u2019m about to explode! Just looking at him makes me want to walk over and beat the crap out of him!\u201dThe north bank audience was incensed, and the south bank audience simply looked on in a daze. Of course, there were some disciples from Fragrant Cloud Peak who sighed inwardly. That was especially true of one burly man. When he saw what was happening, tears welled up in his eyes. He knew exactly how the north bank disciples felt. Back in the minor competition years before, Bai Xiaochun had tormented him in exactly this same way.Up on the balcony, the sect leader and the others almost couldn\u2019t believe their eyes, and quickly began to exchange wry grins.Gongsun Wan\u2019er gritted her teeth and performed a double-handed incantation gesture. Immediately, a vast quantity of ice blades appeared, transforming into a vortex that shot toward Bai Xiaochun. Booms echoed out over and over again as the razor-sharp blades sliced into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s shields. Although many of the shields were destroyed, the flickering Divine Crane Shield eventually made short work of the ice blades.\u201cStill too weak,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said loftily. Inwardly, happiness blossomed in his heart like a flower as he realized what it felt like to be a powerful expert.The north bank disciples were in a frenzy. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that they didn\u2019t dare to break sect rules, they would surely have charged over en masse to slaughter Bai Xiaochun.Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. Gritting her teeth, she continued to unleash attacks, using even more ice blades than before. The sheer number involved was shocking, to the point where even Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart began to tremble in fear. After some time passed, his shields finally gave out completely, whereupon he drew upon the full power of the Divine Crane Shield. In the blink of an eye, his defenses were shored up, and he breathed a sigh of relief. He stuck his chin out, and just when he was about say something, the bedraggled Gongsun Wan\u2019er let out a piercing scream. Rumbling sounds echoed out, and blood oozed out of the corners of her mouth. Astonishingly, a blood-colored ice flower appeared on her forehead, which caused the energy of heaven and earth to flow toward her in shocking fashion.As this happened, the north bank disciples began to cheer at the top of their lungs.\u201cIt\u2019s Elder Sister Gongsun\u2019s Bloodfrost Orchid!\u201d\u201cThe Bloodfrost Orchid is Elder Sister Gongsun\u2019s trump card. Not even someone in the ninth level of Qi Condensation could block it. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s defenses are definitely going to be broken through this time!\u201dAs the freezing flower flew out, radiating a terrifying aura, it caused the surrounding temperature to drop rapidly. It shot toward Bai Xiaochun at top speed, cutting through his defenses like a hot knife through butter. His shields shattered, and just when he was about to use the Divine Crane Shield, the Bloodfrost Orchid split into two parts. One part was successfully blocked, but the other twisted past to slam violently into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s chest.A banging sound could be heard, and Bai Xiaochun looked down in surprise. To him, it felt like getting hit with a fluffy snowball. Shivering slightly, he looked up at Gongsun Wan\u2019er, whose hair was by now completely disheveled.\u201cTake your time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to watch some of the other matches.\u201d With that, he turned in the direction of the first and second battle zones, which he began to casually watch, even occasionally cheering for one side or the other. No matter your perspective, he looked like he was asking for a beating.\u2014Translator: Deathblade. Chinese language consultant: ASI a.k.a. Beerblade. Editor: GNE. Memes: Logan.\u2014Hey everyone, I hate to the bearer of bad news, but in the poll from yesterday, option C was what Beerblade said\u2026 in his mind. Unfortunately he didn\u2019t say it out loud, although later he regretted not having done so. I would love to have seen the faces of the people present if he had. LOL. His true answer was the witty and clever option D.

    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 93: What a Useful PillPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93: What a Useful PillIn the second battle zone, Ghostfang was just on the verge of waving his finger through the air a second time. He could defeat most people with the single wave of a finger, but not Gongsun Yun.As for Gongsun Yun, he dashed backward at top speed and barked that he conceded. He had been able to stand up to one of Ghostfang\u2019s finger attacks, but any more, and he would suffer serious injuries. Knowing that he had no chance of taking first place, he decided that contending for second place would be the best thing to do.Clasping his hands to Ghostfang, he left the arena floor. As he did, he glanced over in the direction of Gongsun Wan\u2019er, and frowned.Ghostfang\u2019s expression was placid as he left the arena floor and returned to where he had been standing all along. When he looked over at Bai Xiaochun and all of his defenses, a strange gleam appeared in his eyes.The audience members from the south bank were all looking down, averting their gazes from the scene playing out on the arena floor\u2026. Embarrassed, they actually felt sorry for the north bank.The north bank disciples were going crazy\u2026.Gongsun Wan\u2019er was frantic, screaming as she launched one attack after another at Bai Xiaochun, using every technique she could think of. She unleashed countless divine abilities and magical techniques, and yet, nothing could break Bai Xiaochun\u2019s defenses.After all, his final line of defense was the black bracelet, a life-saving magic that could protect him from a blow by a Foundation Establishment cultivator. After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, Gongsun Wan\u2019er coughed up a mouthful of blood and collapsed onto the ground, staring at Bai Xiaochun with listless despair.She was about to summon her phoenix when Bai Xiaochun looked over at her and suddenly produced a medicinal pill, which he began to toss up and down in his palm\u2026.Furious, Gongsun Wan\u2019er clenched her hands into fists.\u201cI concede!!\u2019 she said begrudgingly, eyes flickering with defiance.Clasping hands and looking as superior as possible, he said, \u201cYou let me win. It seems you know what\u2019s best, and didn\u2019t force me to attack!\u201dIn response to his words, tears leaked out of the eyes of the south bank disciples. Gongsun Wan\u2019er was so mad she was shaking. Gritting her teeth, she stalked off of the arena floor.It was at this point that the battle between Shangguan Tianyou and Xu Song reached its conclusion. Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s sword descended, and intense light shone out in all directions. Xu Song\u2019s five beasts were all in bad shape, and he himself staggered backward several paces, looking at Shangguan Tianyou in admiration.\u201cIt turns out sword spirit bodies really are pretty incredible!\u201d he said, blood oozing out of his mouth. Finally, he turned and walked off of the arena floor.Shangguan Tianyou didn\u2019t respond. Instead, he looked over at Ghostfang, his eyes glittering, completely convinced of who his only true opponent was!\u201cPresumably, he feels the same way I do,\u201d he thought, \u201cthat fighting against these other people is simply boring.\u201d Shangguan Tianyou retrieved his flying sword and looked over at Bai Xiaochun. When he saw all of his defenses, a gleam of scorn appeared in his eyes. Finally, he walked off of the arena floor, accompanied by the cheers of the south bank disciples.At the same time, Bai Xiaochun walked proudly back to his spot.The first set of matches of the third round was over. The victors were Ghostfang, Shangguan Tianyou, and Bai Xiaochun, with the losers being Xu Song and the Gongsun siblings.Of course, not many people had paid much attention to the victories won by Shangguan Tianyou and Ghostfang. Most people had been focused on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s repeated shamelessness.Bai Xiaochun had succeeded\u2026 in completely altering the atmosphere of the competition. In fact, it was hard to say exactly how much he had influenced the sect as a whole\u2026.The north bank disciples\u2019 eyes were bright red, their hands clenched into fists as they glared at Bai Xiaochun. As tens of thousands of eyes stared at him, he scratched his nose, pretending not to notice.Gongsun Wan\u2019er was so angry she was shaking. Her brother, Gongsun Yun, murmured something to her, after which she clenched her teeth and sat down cross-legged to restore her energy. Everyone else soon followed suit.The rest period lasted for the time it takes three incense sticks to burn. After that, the second match of the third round formally began!In the first battle region, Ghostfang was up against Gongsun Wan\u2019er. As soon as she stepped into the battle region and faced the expressionless Ghostfang, she conceded. She couldn\u2019t afford to be injured, lest it affect her subsequent matches.With Gongsun Wan\u2019er having conceded, Ghostfang took another victory.Meanwhile, in the second battle region, booms echoed out as Shangguan Tianyou fought Gongsun Yun, who had managed to stand up to Ghostfang for one finger attack. Bugs poured out of Gongsun Yun\u2019s sleeves, blotting out the sky as they rushed toward Shangguan Tianyou.Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s expression turned slightly more somber as he waved his right hand, sending a flying sword buzzing out, bursting with sword qi.It should have been a battle that everyone watched closely. However\u2026 audiences from both the south bank and the north bank were all staring at the third battle zone.That was where Bai Xiaochun had loftily taken the stage to fight against Xu Song!Xu Song looked over at him with a cold smile.\u201cYou might be good with medicinal pills and defenses. But now that you\u2019ve met me, you\u2019re doomed to meet a painful end!\u201d With that, Xu Song waved his hand violently through the air, causing cracking sounds to ring out as three beasts appeared out of thin air. One of them was a three-meter-tall gorilla, another was a huge tiger, and the last\u2026 was a gigantic bat.As soon as they appeared, they radiated powerful energy that would crush even someone in the ninth level of Qi Condensation.\u201cAlright, Bai Xiaochun, let\u2019s see if your defenses can stand up to a sustained volley by my three battle beasts!\u201d Smiling viciously, he prepared to attack.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you concede?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said. Sighing, he produced an Aphrodisiac Pill and looked sympathetically over at Xu Song.The north bank disciples were thrown into fits of rage.\u201cHe said it again!\u201d\u201cEradicate Bai Xiaochun!\u201dWhen Xu Song saw the medicinal pill, he threw his head back and laughed uproariously. Face filled with derision and even complacency, he said, \u201cI knew all along that you would try to use that shameless medicinal pill. Did you really think I would come unprepared? I set these three battle beast aside just for you. They\u2019re all female!\u201dIt was because of this that Xu Song was so confident, convinced that he would be able to give the north bank a chance to get revenge.When the north bank disciples heard his words, they instantly got excited, and began to cheer for Xu Song.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart thumped, and his eyes turned up in thought. After a moment, he looked back at Xu Song, eyes filled with sympathy as he said, \u201cThis medicinal pill is effective on humans too, not just animals.\u201dWith that, he looked meaningfully at Xu Song\u2019s three female battle beasts.His words sent the north bank disciples into complete silence. They stared in shock, subconsciously visualizing certain scenes in their mind, cruel scenes that caused them to gasp.Xu Song\u2019s eyes went wide, and his mind filled with thunderous rumbling. His face drained of blood as he contemplated how both Beihan Lie and Gongsun Wan\u2019er had both lost. He suddenly realized that if what Bai Xiaochun said was true, and the medicinal pill\u2019s aphrodisiac effects worked on people\u2026. He swallowed nervously. Without even thinking about it, he edged away from his three battle beasts, trembling. In turn, the three battle beasts, intelligent as they were, looked over at Xu Song and also began to tremble.Without the slightest hesitation, Xu Song quickly put them away, not daring to bet that Bai Xiaochun was bluffing. Even though he had the feeling that Bai Xiaochun was most likely lying, he didn\u2019t want to risk it.Even as the trembling Xu Song put away his battle beasts, Bai Xiaochun strode forward. Light flickered as his defenses went up, and as he closed in on Xu Song, he reached his right hand back and then waved it out in front of him.A blast of power surged out. Xu Song\u2019s strength lay in his control of beasts, and at the moment, he didn\u2019t dare to use even a single one. That cut his effective power in half, and made it impossible for him to stand up to Bai Xiaochun. He was instantly sent flying, blood spraying out of his mouth. When he staggered to a stop, rage and humiliation filled his eyes as he shrieked that he conceded.Bai Xiaochun blinked and then cleared his throat. Clasping hands and bowing, he strutted off the arena floor amidst the countless enraged curses from the north bank disciples.\u201cBai Xiaochun, y-y-you\u2026\u201d\u201cThat damned medicinal pill ought to be destroyed!\u201d\u201cHeavens! I\u2019ll pay ten spirit stones to anyone who can take down Bai Xiaochun!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll put in fifty spirit stones! Take him out!\u201d The north bank was going crazy, and countless people began to shout out that they would add spirit stones as well. Soon the total was over 10,000. The shocked south bank disciples looked at Bai Xiaochun, their admiration for him growing by leaps and bounds.The huge bounty caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face to flicker, and he hurried to escape the arena floor. It felt like a cold wind was blowing up his back, especially when the total bounty passed 20,000 spirit stones. His heart began to thump.\u201cYou people are so unreasonable!\u201d he said loudly, hoping to explain. \u201cEvery single time I go out there, I always give them a chance to concede!\u201dHis explanation only further enraged the north bank disciples, and soon the spirit stone bounty reached 30,000. Up overhead, the phoenix reveled in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s misfortune, and let out continuous piercing cries.The elders on the balcony were getting more and more amused.\u201cI\u2019m a Prestige disciple!\u201d Bai Xiaochun cried threateningly. \u201cI\u2019m the Junior Brother of the sect leader. If anybody tries to put a bounty on me, I\u2019ll have my Master kick them out of the sect!\u201dThen\u2026 the north bank disciples went even crazier. It was hard to say who lost control first, but a flying sword appeared and shot toward the arena floor. Countless north bank disciples all produced various magical items, and their battle beasts roared as if they were preparing to fight a bloody war.Bai Xiaochun fled in terror. Thankfully, the sect elders on the balcony couldn\u2019t let matters go any further. With a single glance, they held back the north bank disciples.It was around this time that the battle between Shangguan Tianyou and Gongsun Yun ended. Shangguan Tianyou had used three flying swords, and Gongsun Yun had gone all out with everything he possessed. In the end, Gongsun Yun conceded, ending the fight.Shangguan Tianyou was slightly out of breath. Gongsun Yun had been strong enough that he had been forced to really start fighting hard. When he left the arena floor and noticed how enraged the north bank disciples were, he frowned and looked over at Bai Xiaochun. Although his eyes flickered with contempt, his heart twinged with jealousy.\u201cRelying only on medicinal pills and defenses? I can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve reached the same stage! Hmph!\u201d With that, Shangguan Tianyou sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes to do breathing exercises.\u2014Translator: Deathblade. Chinese language consultant: ASI a.k.a. Beerblade.

The peak lords sitting around him smiled wryly.The Chosen battles were supposed to be a solemn occasion, but not this time around, and everyone knew it\u2026. Things had begun normally, but the simple addition of Bai Xiaochun into the mix turned everything sour.\u201cBai Xiaochun\u2026 his name sounds good, but he isn\u2019t the least bit pure in any sense of the word.\u201d Elder Zhou chuckled wryly, looking down at Bai Xiaochun hiding in the crowd, and then over at the countless enraged north bank disciples.It was at this point that the peak lord from Irispetal Peak, the old woman, smiled darkly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Bai Xiaochun might be naughty and mischievous, but he\u2019s made himself the archenemy of the entire north bank. We just need to find an opportunity to transfer him to the north bank; that would calm him down quite a bit.\u201dThe eyes of the others present flickered thoughtfully. The only one who reacted differently was Li Qinghou, who looked over at the old woman sympathetically. Based on how well he knew Bai Xiaochun, he was fairly certain that if Bai Xiaochun was transferred to the north bank, the unlucky party wouldn\u2019t be him\u2026.As the group continued to ponder the situation, the third match began.Ghostfang fought Xu Song, and Shangguan Tianyou took on Gongsun Wan\u2019er, but neither battle was even worth watching. Both Ghostfang and Shangguan Tianyou were so strong that they won easily.The disciples of both banks, as well as the sect leader and the others, were all watching the third battle zone. Gongsun Yun was the first to enter the area, pulsing with energy and icy coldness. Moments later, Bai Xiaochun strolled up, looking like a powerful hero.Instead of yelling in rage, the north bank disciples glared murderously. To have so many eyes glaring at him like that left Bai Xiaochun more than a little jumpy.Taking a deep breath, he looked over at Gongsun Yun. Aphrodisiac Pill in hand, he said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you concede?\u201dGongsun Yun looked coldly back at him, eyes shining with hatred. Waving his sleeve, he sent countless black beetles flying out from within his clothes. There were also red centipedes that scurried across the ground at top speed.The sight of so many bugs was completely shocking.Voice cool, Gongsun Yun gave Bai Xiaochun no chance to say anything further. \u201cMy bugs might be classified as male and female, but they\u2019re not beasts. Your medicinal pill won\u2019t work on them.\u201dThe bugs caused an ear-splitting droning sound to fill the air. They were like a sea, surging directly toward Bai Xiaochun.Every bug that made up the sea possessed a certain level of attack power. Although defensive shields could resist them, when their power was combined, they would be quite formidable. Bai Xiaochun was even fairly certain that in this situation, Gongsun Yun actually had a bit of an advantage.\u201cDon\u2019t force my hand, Gongsun Yun,\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted, backing up at top speed, his face paling. \u201cConcede immediately. I really don\u2019t want to attack, you know. Once I do\u2026 you\u2019re done for!\u201dGongsun Yun chuckled coldly. \u201cLet\u2019s see which happens first, your flesh getting eaten off your bones, or me being done for.\u201d Looking even more scornful than before, he waved his hand, sending even more bugs surging forth.The crowd from the south bank looked on in fear and astonishment. Everyone watching had already been convinced of how powerful Gongsun Yun was. Not only was he adept at using bugs, he also had powerful magical techniques. He was able to defend against one of Ghostfang\u2019s finger attacks, and even forced Shangguan Tianyou to attack three times with his sword, tiring him out significantly.The north bank audience looked on, their excitement building.\u201cNice job, Elder Brother Gongsun! Take Bai Xiaochun down!\u201d\u201cHahaha! Let\u2019s see how you fight back this time, Bai Xiaochun! You just wait! Those bugs are going to burrow into your flesh and eat you alive!\u201d\u201cYour comeuppance is at hand, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d The countless north bank disciples were extremely excited. Furthermore, their battle beasts could sense their masters\u2019 excitement, and began to howl in response.In the blink of an eye, the black beetles were right in front of Bai Xiaochun, slamming into his defensive shields, ripping and tearing at them with their mandibles. The shields quickly began to fade and grow dim.Then the red centipedes arrived, causing his defenses to weaken even more quickly. Some of them even managed to gnaw their way past the shields.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s scalp tingled with fright, and his eyes went bloodshot.\u201cGongsun Yun, you\u2019re forcing my hand!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was reaching the point of having no choice but to use his trump card, something he\u2019d hoped to avoid. Taking a deep breath, heart pounding, he sent a surge of energy into the shields, blasting away a significant portion of the bugs. Even as they turned to charge back toward him, an Aphrodisiac Pill appeared in his hand, which he threw in the direction of the north bank audience.The pill shot through the air with a whooshing sound, and before anyone could react, was in the air above the stands on the north side of the arena. The disciples gaped in shock, and at the same time, Bai Xiaochun shouted, \u201cDetonate!\u201dA boom rang out as the Aphrodisiac Pill exploded, transforming into ash which drifted down in all directions, covering nearly half of the north bank disciples.Gongsun Yun\u2019s eyes went wide with shock.Bai Xiaochun actually wasn\u2019t sure whether or not the pill would have an effect on humans; he had never dared to personally test out any of the strange pills he\u2019d concocted. However, he was certain that the pill was effective on animals, and would stimulate them to a shocking degree.In the blink of an eye, the ash that was the remains of the Aphrodisiac Pill had fallen down onto the battle beasts below, which began to throw their heads back and howl. Their bodies grew larger, their eyes turned red, and they began to pant heavily. In turn, their masters cried out in alarm and began to back up.It took only a moment for the north bank disciples to devolve into a stampede, quickly clearing the entire area of people. The only thing that remained were the howling beasts, sitting there looking around for a target.The north bank disciples all began to shriek at the tops of their lungs. \u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201dAt the same time, beads of sweat popped out on Gongsun Yun\u2019s forehead, which was shocking considering that after beginning to cultivate the Dao of bugs, he had never sweat.Now, though, he was panting heavily as Bai Xiaochun slowly pulled out another medicinal pill. As soon as he did, the stimulated battle beasts began to tremble in excitement. Gongsun Yun couldn\u2019t help but think about what had occurred when a pill just like that had been shattered and then spread onto Beihan Lie.\u201cYou\u2026.\u201dAn intense feeling of foreboding rose up in his heart, and he began to tremble. Images flashed through his mind, and he began to back up. Even his legs were shaking. He could well imagine what would happen if Bai Xiaochun crushed that pill on him\u2026 and then the battle beasts pounced.\u201cYou forced my hand,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said with a despairing scowl. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do this.\u201d With that, he pulled his hand back in preparation to throw the pill.\u201cI concede!!\u201d shrieked Gongsun Yun in the most high-pitched voice that had left his mouth in his entire life. His face was ashen as he raced off of the arena floor. Only when he was safe amongst the crowd did he look back in fright at Bai Xiaochun.\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s jaw dropped at the sight of the terrified Gongsun Yun hiding in the crowd. Then he looked at the trembling battle beasts, and suddenly had a very bad feeling.Many of them were howling at the tops of their lungs, eyes fixed directly on the medicinal pill he held in his hand. They were already started to edge toward him. Drops of sweat broke out on his forehead, and he suddenly turned to look at the crowd of north bank disciples.That simple turn of his head caused the north bank disciples\u2019 hearts to seize with fear.Bai Xiaochun turned to look in another direction, but quickly found that any place he looked at would quickly become devoid of people. Everyone would scramble away at top speed, screaming in desperation.Finally, his gaze came to rest on the south bank disciples.Instantly\u2026 their scalps went numb, and they began to back up. In the blink of an eye, everyone had retreated by thirty meters.\u201cWe\u2019re on the same side, Sect Uncle Bai!\u201d people began to cry out. \u201cThe same side!\u201dEven Ghostfang and Shangguan Tianyou were backing up, their faces flickering with shock.ROAR! More of the stimulated battle beasts began to walk forward, their eyes crimson, salivating as they eyed Bai Xiaochun.\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat do I do?! Didn\u2019t I warn you people to concede? Didn\u2019t I say that I fear my own attacks!?\u201dFeeling that he was completely innocent in the matter, he gritted his teeth and looked over at the north bank audience. \u201cDidn\u2019t you people just say something about putting a bounty on my head?!\u201dNone of the trembling north bank disciples dared to even look Bai Xiaochun in the eye.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart was also trembling. In his heart, he believed himself to be a good person, and wasn\u2019t willing to simply throw the pill out in a random direction. Anxiety building up within him, he looked at the increasingly stimulated battle beasts, and then finally happened to glance up into the sky above him and notice the proud, arrogant phoenix of Elder Zhou\u2019s.Eyes shining, and having no time to consider the matter, he launched the medicinal pill at top speed toward the phoenix; it transformed into a beam of light shooting through the air.The phoenix was in the middle of gloating over Bai Xiaochun\u2019s misfortune, and didn\u2019t even notice the pill flying toward him at first. When he did, his feathers all stood on end, and he let out a miserable shriek. Just when he was about to dodge, the pill exploded, covering him with a fine powder.The phoenix stared in shock as the battle beasts below began to howl. Eyes burning as if with fire, they began to leap up into the air as if to chase down the phoenix.The sect leader and the others gasped, crowding around the edge of the balcony to look down at what was happening.At one point, one of the random elders asked, \u201cIs attacking the audience\u2026 against the rules?\u201dHowever, nobody seemed to care about that at the moment. All of them were staring down into the north stands, at the area devoid of people but filled with battle beasts. The remaining three peak lords from the north bank all had strange looks in their eyes as they stared at one particular beast among the crowd.It looked like a deer, and was currently howling up into the air under the effects of the Aphrodisiac Pill.\u201cBefore, I assumed that pill\u2019s effectiveness was limited to beasts with third order bloodlines\u2026. I never imagined that it would also be effective on second order bloodlines!\u201d\u201cThat pill\u2026 would be incredibly useful to us on the north bank!\u201d The three peak lords from the north bank were trembling in excitement. The old woman among their number then waved her right finger through the air toward the phoenix.Instantly, the phoenix trembled as a powerful force wrapped around it and dragged it down toward the balcony. At the same time, the battle beasts roared and flew in the same direction.The old woman snorted coldly and looked down at the beasts, which then began to howl mournfully. Another powerful force swept them up, sending them spinning toward her. As they approached, they shrank down and disappeared into her sleeve.The old woman looked over at the miserable, shrieking phoenix, eyes shining as she turned to confer with the other peak lords.Off to the side, Elder Zhou\u2019s face had turned green\u2026.Bai Xiaochun seemed no worse for the wear. Heaving a sigh of relief, he was just about to walk off the arena floor when the north banks disciples recovered from the fear of the threat which had been levied against them, and began to roar in anger.\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d\u201cBai Xiaochun, the north bank will never rest until you\u2019re dead!!\u201d\u201cExterminate Bai Xiaochun!!\u201d The north bank disciples had veins bulging out on their necks and faces as they howled in fury. In response, Bai Xiaochun turned back to look at them, and raised an ordinary medicinal pill up into the air as he stuck his jaw out.Instantly\u2026 the entire crowd trembled and went completely silent.Bai Xiaochun waved his sleeve and chuckled darkly. Popping the medicinal pill into his mouth, he left the arena floor\u2026. Behind him, the north bank disciples erupted in rage yet again.\u2014Translator: Deathblade.

    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 95: That\u2019s Not How You Use Swords!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 95: That\u2019s Not How You Use Swords!The disciples of the south bank looked at Bai Xiaochun in admiration, and even began to give voice to their feelings.\u201cSect Uncle Bai\u2026 is a god!\u201d\u201cSect Uncle Bai has become the archenemy of the north bank, a path that cannot be returned from. But how far will he go\u2026?\u201dMany of them were even rejoicing at the fact that Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t from the north bank. If he were, it was impossible to imagine how much the south bank would have suffered.\u201cSect Uncle Bai is enough for our south bank. He alone can drive the north bank crazy.\u201dXu Baocai had already been struck speechless numerous times on this day, but it was only now that he realized\u2026 that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s power seemed limitless.Regardless, the atmosphere of the Chosen battles had been completely changed. And yet, the matches would continue. The south bank side was filled with admiration, and the north bank stewed in their madness as the fourth set of matches began.Shangguan Tianyou, Ghostfang, and Bai Xiaochun all had three victories to their names, so their presence wasn\u2019t even needed to finish the final rankings for the fourth, fifth, and sixth place spots.The Gongsun siblings and Xu Song took the floor to finish things. In the end, Gongsun Yun defeated Gongsun Wan\u2019er, as well as Xu Song. No more battles were necessary to determine the rankings.Xu Song was not a match for Gongsun Yun, and even if he fought Gongsun Wan\u2019er and lost, that one battle wouldn\u2019t change the final rankings. As such, Xu Song took fifth place.With five defeats, Gongsun Wan\u2019er lost a bit of glory and took sixth place. Fourth place went to Gongsun Yun.Next to be determined were the final rankings for the top three disciples! Everyone was watching with keen anticipation to see how Bai Xiaochun, Shangguan Tianyou and Ghostfang would end up in the final standings.Of course, the north bank disciples glared angrily at Bai Xiaochun the entire time. They approved of Ghostfang and Shangguan Tianyou, but their opinion of Bai Xiaochun was that he was completely shameless and despicable.The north bank\u2019s hopes all rested on Ghostfang. As far as they were concerned, it wouldn\u2019t matter what plots Bai Xiaochun hatched, he was no match for Ghostfang in terms of power, and would be crushed like a twig.\u201cFirst battle. Bai Xiaochun versus Shangguan Tianyou!\u201d Apparently due to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s antics, Ouyang Jie\u2019s voice was no longer as cold and sinister as it had been, and in fact, it almost seemed like he was sighing.Shangguan Tianyou looked up, a powerful gleam in his eye as he thought about how he\u2019d been outdone by Bai Xiaochun in the qualifying round. As he walked out onto the arena floor, the breeze lifted his hair, making him look even more handsome than usual, like a precious sword that would cause countless disciples\u2019 eyes to glitter.Of course, none of the south bank disciples dared to cheer. After all, Bai Xiaochun was also from the south bank, and had many tricks up his sleeve. They feared that if they cheered for his opponent, he would remember, and hold it against them. Therefore, they had no choice but to bite their tongues.The north bank, on the other hand, actually did start to cheer for Shangguan Tianyou. In response, Shangguan Tianyou frowned, aware that they weren\u2019t really cheering for him, but against Bai Xiaochun. The north bank would cheer for any opponent of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s, even if it were a pig. The thought left Shangguan Tianyou even more displeased than before.Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat and walked out onto the arena floor. Looking over at Shangguan Tianyou, he flicked his sleeve and smiled. \u201cListen, there\u2019s no need for all this. We\u2019re both\u2013\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, however, Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s eyes blazed, and he waved his finger. Instantly, his flying sword pierced through the air as fast as a bolt of lightning. It moved so quickly that before Bai Xiaochun could even react, it was right there, a few inches in front of his face!Pupils constricting, mind bursting with a sensation of imminent crisis, he ducked down. A blast of wind from the sword buffeted him from above, and one of his hairs was severed, which then floated down in front of him.\u201cWhen cultivators fight, we seize every opportunity,\u201d Shangguan Tianyou said coolly. \u201cEven if you hadn\u2019t avoided that sword, it wouldn\u2019t have killed you. You are naughty and mischievous, and severely lacking in good family values. Since your father and mother didn\u2019t discipline you, I guess I\u2019ll step in to provide you with a bit of education. However, you\u2019d better not use any vile or treacherous methods, and lose face for the south bank.\u201d As he spoke, his flying sword circled back around and came to rest floating in front of him.The north bank went quiet for a moment, then broke out into cheering. The south bank maintained their silence. None of them seemed very happy with Shangguan Tianyou, and even some of the people who considered themselves his fans were frowning.After all, the south bank disciples generally didn\u2019t hate Bai Xiaochun. Although he was somewhat naughty and mischievous, it wasn\u2019t excessive. He left them feeling a bit helpless sometimes, but they actually liked him. The north bank hated him, but to the south bank, he represented their hope for glory.Furthermore, it was obvious to everyone that Bai Xiaochun had been on the verge of conceding. Clearly, he\u2019d hoped to keep from getting into a fierce fight with Shangguan Tianyou, thus sparing Shangguan Tianyou some spiritual power to use in his final battle with Ghostfang.Shangguan Tianyou had been aware of that too, and yet had attacked anyway, and in an underhanded way at that. Then he talked about educating Bai Xiaochun, and even dishonored his family. Behavior like that left many south bank disciples quite uncomfortable!Bai Xiaochun knelt there, watching his hair float down in front of him. Slowly, his smile faded, and he looked up at Shangguan Tianyou, the word \u201ceducation\u201d ringing in his ears.\u201cYou\u2019re a Chosen, so if you want to look down on me, fine. I don\u2019t really care what other people think about me anyway.\u201d For some reason, something seemed different about Bai Xiaochun all of a sudden.\u201cYou want to use underhanded attacks? That\u2019s your business. I practice cultivation so that I can live forever. I don\u2019t like fighting and killing.\u201d He waved his right hand off to the side, tossing the defensive amulets away. All of a sudden, it seemed as if his veins were filled with, not blood, but steel.In the south bank audience, Hou Yunfei\u2019s eyes glittered, and he couldn\u2019t stop himself from shaking. All of a sudden, he was looking at the same Bai Xiaochun who had saved him from the Luochen Clan.\u201cBut what gives you the right\u2026 to step in for my dad and mom and educate me!?!?\u201d Bai Xiaochun eyes were completely bloodshot. His parents had both passed away when he was young, an event which had influenced him in profound ways. It was one of the biggest reasons why he began to wish to live forever.He was a generally optimistic person, an attitude he had intentionally fostered since a young age. There had been no other option. He had personally watched his parents die of illness. He remembered sitting with their corpses for days, weeping, refusing to believe that they were gone, even calling their names. Eventually, the corpses began to stink, and relatives came to bury them. Bai Xiaochun had been left in a daze, and at one point even took to talking to himself\u2026. If a child grew up in such a manner, his entire life would be one of darkness.So Bai Xiaochun replaced the crying with laughter. He began to think about the idea of living forever. He would never forget how his parents had died, and although he missed them, it only made him want to keep living.He was stubborn and mischievous, but not to an excessive degree. Many of the things he did were even accidents. Deep down, he was a good person.He feared death, and seemed weak on the outside, but when his friends were in danger, he would fight to the death to protect them. If he needed to, he could bellow in rage and risk his life on the field of battle.He liked to joke, but was also deeply emotional. Big Fatty Zhang, Li Qinghou, Hou Yunfei, Du Lingfei, Hou Xiaomei, the sect leader, and all the other people who treated him well, were people he would never, ever forget.\u201cWhat gives you the right?!\u201d He suddenly burst into action, moving so quickly that he was instantly in front of Shangguan Tianyou. Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s eyes widened, and his hair stood on end, but before he could do a single thing in response, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fist struck out, glittering with silver light.Rumbling sounds could be heard as Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s personal shield sprang up, but it was absolutely incapable of providing any defense. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fist pierced through it like a hammer crushing ice. Just as it was about to land on Shangguan Tianyou, a tiny buckler appeared, which subsequently trembled and was sent flying off to the side. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fist landed on Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s chest, causing blood to spray out of his mouth. Shangguan Tianyou felt as if a huge force had slammed into him, and he staggered backward ten paces, coughing up more blood, an expression of utter incredulity on his face.\u201cAre you really Chosen?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked coolly. He didn\u2019t stick his jaw out. He didn\u2019t put on the air of a lonely hero. But everyone looking at him in that moment felt like they were looking at a blazing sun. Gasps could be heard among the south bank disciples, and the north bank audience was completely stunned.Ghostfang\u2019s eyes began to shine, and up on the balcony, the sect leader and the others had very serious expression on their faces.\u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201d Shangguan Tianyou growled. Feeling completely humiliated, he roared and performed a double-handed incantation gesture. Five flying swords appeared, all of which emanated terrifying sword qi. Taking control of them with his spirit sword body, Shangguan Tianyou sent them flying toward Bai Xiaochun.Rumbling could be heard as the swords blurred into motion, becoming five sword dragons, each one of them about two meters wide and thirty meters long. As they arced through the air, everything shook, and even the surface of the arena floor began to crumble. Based on the shocking level of energy they displayed, any one of the swords would be able to kill an ordinary disciple. Two would definitely take out other elite disciples. As for Chosen like Gongsun Yun, three would be enough to force him to concede. But now five appeared, filling the entire arena floor with a shocking sword aura.\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about sword techniques,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said coolly. \u201cNor do I have a sword spirit body. But from what I know\u2026 that\u2019s not how you use swords!\u201d With that, he waved his finger, and the Golden Crow Sword appeared, a golden beam of light that slashed toward the first of Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s swords!I don\u2019t care if you use three swords or five, I only need one!That one sword caused the sky to shake, and became an explosive stream of sword qi!That one sword used Heaviness-in-Lightness and Lightness-in-Heaviness!That one sword was backed by the perfect amount of spiritual power, without the slightest bit of wastage!It was true that Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t really know anything about sword techniques. But he knew the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art, Heaviness-in-Lightness, and Lightness-in-Heaviness. He knew that, although a leaf could not be used to lift a log, if you rolled it up, it could lift a small rock. Furthermore, if you tore the leaf into strips and wove them together, it could lift an even heavier rock!He knew the proper way to manipulate spiritual power!Sometimes, mastering one technique was superior to knowing tens of thousands of them. In the Qi Condensation stage\u2026 his skill combined with his Undying Silver Skin made him invincible!BOOOOOOOOOMMM!An ear-splitting explosion rocked the entire area, and countless chunks of rubble were thrown into the air. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s single sword strike became a tempest that slammed into Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s five sword dragons. The sword dragons twisted and distorted, and then exploded into countless fragments. Then the blast of wind continued on, slamming directly into Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s face.Bai Xiaochun stood there, his hair whipping in the wind, his expression placid. He didn\u2019t clasp his hands behind his back, and didn\u2019t flick his sleeve. He simply stood there, as calm as ice. It was a scene that would forever be etched into the minds of all disciples of the north and south banks.\u201cIs that really\u2026 Bai Xiaochun?\u201d Everyone felt as if their minds were about to explode.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Will EternalChapter 96: Fighting GhostfangPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 96: Fighting GhostfangThe south bank was shaken. All of the disciples who actually knew Bai Xiaochun felt like they suddenly didn\u2019t recognize the person standing there in front of them. He seemed like a stranger. The Bai Xiaochun they remembered loved to make people call him Sect Uncle Bai. He was a somewhat annoying person who made everyone feel like giving him a good beating. This person was completely different.Gasps could be heard coming from the north bank audience. The disciples there stared blankly, and their minds spun. Although they hadn\u2019t known Bai Xiaochun for very long, he had already given them the impression that he was completely shameless. In sharp contrast, the person they were looking at now left them shaken to the core.Up on the balcony, Zheng Yuandong\u2019s eyes shone with an extraordinary gleam. The other peak lords had very serious expressions on their faces, and Li Qinghou looked on with a slight smile. A warm feeling filled his heart, along with a sensation of pride.All the other elders were also looking on with serious looks in their eyes.Shangguan Tianyou flew through the air a bit above the arena floor, coughing up blood, a blank look in his eyes. He couldn\u2019t believe that he was losing, and of all people, to Bai Xiaochun, whom he held in complete contempt. He had been injured, but the humiliation he felt exceeded the pain of his wounds. Just as he was about to fly off of the arena floor, he let out a powerful shout.\u201cThis battle isn\u2019t over yet, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d With that, he bit his tongue and spit out a mouthful of blood. His hair instantly withered, and at the same time, he performed a double-handed incantation gesture. A moment later, he trembled as a blood-colored light shot out from the top of his head!The light surged up high above him, where it transformed into a blood sword!Numerous disciples in the audience instantly recognized what they were looking at. \u201cOne of the ten secret magics! True Self Sword!\u201d\u201cHellfiend Formation!\u201d Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s hands blurred as he performed another incantation gesture, then waved his finger toward Bai Xiaochun. Instantly, the blood sword transformed into countless strands of blood that swirled out to become a net of swords, which then shot toward Bai Xiaochun with an ear-piercing whistling sound.Bai Xiaochun simply extended his right hand and pointed out with his index finger.Up ahead of him, the air distorted as an enormous cauldron appeared. Although it was illusory, it seemed close to being corporeal. The complex designs which covered its surface were clearly visible, making seem very realistic.\u201cViolet Qi Cauldron Summoning!? Heavens!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so realistic! That\u2019s not an ordinary Violet Qi Cauldron Summoning, that\u2019s the second level!\u201d Cries of astonishment could be heard coming from the south bank audience, especially the disciples from Violet Cauldron Peak.Gasps could also be heard from the north bank audience as the violet cauldron and the blood-colored sword formation slammed into each other, causing a deafening boom to fill the air. Shangguan Tianyou let out a miserable shriek as he was sent spinning backward, blood spraying out of his mouth.Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression was the same as ever as he stood there on the arena floor, watching the enormous cauldron fade away. At the same time, Ghostfang\u2019s eyes suddenly began to gleam, and without another word, he flew over to stand across from Bai Xiaochun.\u201cShangguan Tianyou is too weak to fight any longer,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s make things simple\u2026 and fight right now!\u201d Even as the words left his mouth, black mist began to pulse out around him, swirling into the form of numerous vicious ghosts who let out soundless shrieks.The ghosts were completely vicious in appearance. Some had disheveled hair, some had green skin, and some looked like rotting corpses. There were even some that carried their own heads in their arms. They were terrifying to the extreme.The entire arena floor began to fill with an aura of death, causing hearts to grow cold among the disciples of both banks.As that happened, numerous figures flew out of the crowd on both sides, people with very serious expressions on their faces. They weren\u2019t Outer Sect disciples, but rather, Inner Sect disciples from both the south and north banks who were extremely interested in the final match of the Chosen battles!Even the divine sense of the prime elders atop Mount Daoseed was completely focused on the arena floor.All eyes were glued on Bai Xiaochun and Ghostfang!Bai Xiaochun slowly turned to face Ghostfang, his expression serious. He had seen Ghostfang fight several times during the Chosen battles, and each time had been astonishing. A single wave of his finger had almost killed Lu Tianlei, and that had been only seventy percent of his power.It was hard to imagine what it would be like if he unleashed all of his battle prowess.In the moment that Bai Xiaochun looked over at Ghostfang, Ghostfang\u2019s eyes flickered with a mysterious light. Then he waved his finger at Bai Xiaochun, causing rumbling sounds to fill heaven and earth. A gigantic ghost claw appeared next to Ghostfang, filling half of the arena floor. Surging with astonishing levels of power, it rocketed toward Bai Xiaochun.In the blink of an eye, it was upon him. Bai Xiaochun clenched his right hand into a fist, and silver light flashed, making him look like a silver statue. Then he struck out toward the incoming ghost claw.From a distance, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s slight frame seemed completely insignificant compared to the shocking ghost claw. And yet, as soon as his fist made contact with it, an ear-splitting blast exploded out.BOOOOOOOOOMMM!The thunderous explosion caused disciples on both sides of the arena to tumble backward, astonished expressions on their faces. Some of them even saw stars swimming in their eyes.As the shockwave spread out from the contact point, the ghost claw trembled. Cracking sounds rang out, and fissures spread out to fill its entire surface. One breath of time passed, and then the gigantic ghost claw shattered into countless pieces.Black mist exploded out in all directions, and the entire arena floor shook violently. Ghostfang\u2019s eyes shone brightly as he fell back a single pace before slamming his foot down to stop himself.Cracks spread out in the ground from the foot he stomped down. As for Bai Xiaochun, he also fell back a single pace, his face flushed, his hand glittering with silver light. If you looked closely at that hand, it was possible to see it trembling slightly.The surrounding disciples gasped, and both sides of the arena immediately burst forth with cries of shock and astonishment.\u201cI can\u2019t believe\u2026 Bai Xiaochun is\u2026 so strong!!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s actually at the same level as Elder Brother Ghostfang! Back when the Luochen Clan turned traitor, I heard that he barely escaped with his life, but killed a bunch of them in the process. I thought those stories were exaggerations, but now\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen anyone destroy Ghostfang\u2019s ghost claw!\u201dThe Inner Sect disciples were equally astonished, and all of them felt their hearts pounding with bitter astonishment as they looked at Bai Xiaochun and Ghostfang. As far as they were concerned, these two weren\u2019t even Outer Sect disciples any more. Oftentimes, years would pass without a single inhuman disciple rising up from within the ranks. And yet now\u2026 two had appeared at the same time.Up on the balcony, the sect leader\u2019s eyes shone with joy, and the other elders\u2019 eyebrows were raised in shock.Bai Xiaochun frowned at the tingling sensation he felt in his hand, but the feeling soon went away. Looking over at Ghostfang, he realized that he was facing a formidable opponent.Ghostfang\u2019s eyes shone with what appeared to be happiness. \u201cI only used fifty percent power, but you still destroyed my finger attack. That means you\u2019re a lot stronger than anyone else I\u2019ve faced. Well, in that case\u2026 I can safely use eighty percent power.\u201dRight hand flashing with an incantation gesture, he waved his finger again at Bai Xiaochun.Instantly, black mist swirled into being above Bai Xiaochun. The air was ripped apart as, unexpectedly, another huge ghost claw appeared.This one was even more massive than the one which had nearly killed Lu Tianlei, and caused rumbling sounds to echo out in all directions as it descended toward Bai Xiaochun like a mountain.Bai Xiaochun looked up, clenched his right hand into a fist, and then launched into the air, turning into a bright beam of light that shot directly toward the ghost claw.Silver light spread out in all directions as the power of his fist caused heaven and earth to shake. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Undying Skin erupted with power, causing the ghost claw to tremble, and then begin to break apart just like the previous one!Ghostfang\u2019s face flickered as he performed more incantation gestures, sending a third, a fourth, and a fifth finger attack out in quick succession.In the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun was facing four enormous ghost claws.Although all of this takes some time to describe, it happened in the briefest of instants. As the four ghost claws bore down on Bai Xiaochun, the Outer Sect disciples cried out in alarm, and even the Inner Sect disciples were left completely shaken.On the balcony, the sect leader and the others shot to their feet, and Li Qinghou\u2019s eyes glittered. However, a moment later, they all realized that there was no need to intervene and rescue Bai Xiaochun.In the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint, a huge boom echoed out as the ghost claws all landed on Bai Xiaochun, and the arena floor was reduced to nothing more than dust. The resultant cloud of dust that filled the air obscured Bai Xiaochun.However, a moment later, a flicker like that of lightning could be seen in the dust as a figure shot out at top speed toward Ghostfang.\u201cThroat Crushing Grasp!\u201d The only thing that could be seen see was flickering, silver light. Then, two fingers appeared directly in front of Ghostfang, filling him with an intense sensation of deadly crisis, the likes of which he had never felt before. He let out a hoarse shout, causing mist to surge up around him in the form of a defensive shield. At the same time, he fell back in retreat.However, at that very moment, a powerful gravitational force erupted from Bai Xiaochun\u2019s two fingers. Not only was Ghostfang prevented from retreating, he was actually pulled toward the fingers.When his defensive shield made contact with the fingers, it was crushed in the briefest of moments. None of his subsequent defensive measures did anything, not even the three bucklers he summoned. The first was instantly shattered, the second cracked into two pieces, and the third, despite remaining whole, was sent spinning away.None of them could stop Bai Xiaochun!The two fingers crushed anything in their path as easily as a hammer destroying ice. Ghostfang let out a miserable shriek, and shockingly, more than thirty percent of his hair turned white as he paid a shocking price to suddenly become transparent and disappear! Bai Xiaochun\u2019s two fingers passed directly through him, clasping down onto nothing but air.A boom rang out as the air was crushed and shattered. A moment later, Ghostfang appeared some distance away from Bai Xiaochun, coughing up blood, his face wrinkled as if with age.Panting, he said, \u201cYou forced me to use one of my life-saving magics, Bai Xiaochun\u2026. I underestimated you!\u201dInstead of retreating, he actually seemed like he wanted to continue fighting. However, he was unsure of what divine ability had just been used against him, something that seemed to vastly exceed the battle prowess of the Qi Condensation stage.Blood oozed out of the corners of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth as he stood there, wok cracked, skin covered with lacerations; even his aura was in chaos.He had managed to stand up to five of the ghost claws, but it had been very difficult. Without his Undying Skin being at the silver level, he would surely have been defeated.Sadly, his last powerful attack had been avoided.\u2014Translator: Deathblade.

It was only in this moment that they finally realized why it was that Bai Xiaochun had managed to survive his fight with the Luochen Clan, and why he had been named a Prestige disciple!\u201cHe\u2019s actually\u2026 so strong!!\u201d That was what all of the shocked disciples were thinking.As for the north bank audience, their minds were in shambles.Up on the balcony, the various elders all had bright gleams in their eyes as they mentally replayed the moment in which Bai Xiaochun struck that incredible blow, and the silver light which covered him.\u201cThat\u2019s the Undying Live Forever Technique! He\u2019s reached the silver level!\u201d\u201cThat final blow was\u2026 the Throat Crushing Grasp!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe that someone actually succeeded in cultivating the Undying Live Forever Technique! It\u2019s virtually impossible! It\u2019s an extraordinary technique, but sadly, its origins are a complete mystery, and furthermore, our version is incomplete\u2026.\u201d\u201cI very much look forward to seeing if one of these two end up in the Legacy Echelon years from now!\u201d The sect leader sighed. Such an event would only come after many years had passed. Reaching the Legacy Echelon was a very, very difficult matter. Even the mere thought of it caused him to look over at Li Qinghou. \u201cReach the Gold Core stage within two sixty-year-cycles, and that puts you in the Legacy Echelon,\u201d he thought. \u201cOur only hope for this generation\u2026 is Li Qinghou.\u201dBack on the arena floor, Ghostfang waved his hand, causing a green light to flow out, which transformed into an enormous greenwood banner, which he stuck into the ground next to him.Then he sat down cross-legged, his eyes shining with the desire to fight.\u201cBai Xiaochun, you are worthy. I will now open my seals!\u201cFirst level seal, open!\u201d With that, his right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and he pushed his finger down onto his forehead. A droning sound could be heard, and he trembled visibly as numerous streams of black light exploded out from inside of him. As they swirled around, he grew slightly larger, and a powerful aura erupted out, an aura which reached well into the Foundation Establishment stage.\u201cSixth finger! Seventh! Eighth! Ninth! Tenth!\u201dRoaring, he waved his finger at Bai Xiaochun five times in a row, each time unleashing greater power than before. Heaven and earth trembled as five gigantic ghost claws began to descend from above, radiating shocking levels of energy.Gasps could be heard from the audience.\u201cIs that\u2026 still a Qi Condensation magical technique? It looks like something from Foundation Establishment!!\u201d\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve seen a Qi Condensation disciple unleash magic as shocking as that!\u201d\u201cOnly some type of secret magic could do such a thing! All secret magics in the Spirit Stream Sect can be used to some extent in the Qi Condensation stage!!\u201dBai Xiaochun\u2019s pupils constricted. The pressure he felt from Ghostfang now felt even greater than before, and even beyond what he had faced in his fight with the crown prince of the Luochen Clan.Of course, this was not a battle to the death. Back in his fight with the Luochen Clan\u2026 his life had been on the line!Although he wasn\u2019t fighting for his life right now, he still didn\u2019t want to lose. If there was no chance for him to take first place, then he wouldn\u2019t even try, but now that first place was in sight\u2026 he wanted it!Not for the supposed reputation it would earn him, but because of the approval he knew he would see in Li Qinghou\u2019s eyes.That was enough of a reason for him!Eyes bloodshot, he waved his sleeve and performed an incantation gesture. Spiritual power surged within him, and a violet cauldron appeared. Then a second, a third\u2026 until five cauldrons hovered around him!In the blink of an eye, five violet cauldrons materialized and shot toward the five ghost claws. Simultaneously, the Golden Crow Sword appeared in a streak of golden light, summoning the golden crow, which let out a piercing cry as it shot toward Ghostfang!At the same time, Bai Xiaochun shot forward, ignoring the ghost claws as he closed in on Ghostfang himself.A boom rang out as the five violet cauldrons slammed into the five ghost claws. The cauldrons shattered. As for the ghost claws, they faded a bit, but continued to close in on Bai Xiaochun at top speed. Then rumbling could be heard as the Divine Crane Shield appeared, and an enormous crane materialized around Bai Xiaochun.When the ghost claws slammed into it, cracking sounds could be heard as they faded even more. The crane let out a piercing shriek, vanishing and returning to the shield itself, incapable of providing any further defense.The five ghost claws proceeded unhindered to slam into Bai Xiaochun. However, just before they touched him, black light spread out and covered him, the result of the life-saving magic given to him by Li Qinghou.When the ghost claws hit the black light, they couldn\u2019t stand up to its power. Deafening booms rang out as they were destroyed. Bai Xiaochun coughed up a mouthful of blood, and yet, suffered no other injuries. The black light faded, and Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered as he closed in on Ghostfang with the Golden Crow Sword. By this point, he was a mere fifteen meters away, and the Golden Crow Sword was only three meters from Ghostfang.Ghostfang\u2019s face flickered as he grabbed his greenwood banner and leaped backward. The Golden Crow Sword sped past his shoulder, slicing a wound open as it passed. Blood sprayed out, but Ghostfang ignored the pain. Hair disheveled and eyes bloodshot, he waved the banner and said, \u201cSecond level seal, open! Ten Ghosts\u2026 Haunt the Night!\u201dTerrifying howling noises rose up from the greenwood banner as two scaled ghost arms ripped the banner open. Out stepped a vicious green ghost with a long horn sticking out of its head and a ferocious grin on its face.The sky suddenly darkened as sinister black clouds roiled into existence, almost as if night had fallen.More vicious ghosts emerged from within the banner, a total of ten. Each one was bursting with energy equivalent to the great circle of Qi Condensation. As they began to charge Bai Xiaochun, his face flickered, and his heart began to pound. Even if he were stronger than his current level, there was no way he could fight ten ghosts who had battle prowess equivalent to the great circle of Qi Condensation.Ghostfang breathed a sigh of relief. He couldn\u2019t keep his second seal open for too long, and knew that all of his hopes for victory rested with these ten ghosts.He stood there behind them, eying Bai Xiaochun coldly.The battle between these two had been like a fight between a dragon and a tiger, and provoked cries of alarm and surprise from the audience. Now everyone could see exactly how powerful Ghostfang was, and the north bank audience was in high spirits. As for the south bank disciples, they were starting to get very nervous.Bai Xiaochun was in full retreat as the ten ghosts spread out to surround him. Their cultivation bases were shocking, so powerful that not even the Golden Crow Sword could defend against them.\u201cTen Ghosts Haunt the Night\u2026.\u201d Suddenly, he looked up into the sky at the black clouds that made everything seem like night. Eyes flickering thoughtfully, his right hand flashed with an incantation gesture, and the Golden Crow Sword shot up toward the clouds. Apparently, Bai Xiaochun wanted to slash the clouds open so that the arena floor was no longer covered in night.Ghostfang frowned slightly in response to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s quick reaction. The best time to use this divine ability of his was at night, when it was virtually invincible. During the daytime, it was definitely possible to break it\u2026 unless he unleashed the Hundred Ghosts level.\u201cThat cloud cover is beyond ordinary,\u201d Ghostfang thought with a cold smile. \u201cOnly spirit enhanced treasures could possibly break it. Even if Bai Xiaochun finds a weakness, he\u2019s definitely not strong enough to pierce it open!\u201dIt was at that point that the Golden Crow Sword pierced into the clouds, and rumbling echoed out. The clouds seemed to weaken, but strangely, sucked in the Golden Crow Sword, making it impossible to use again.Getting nervous, Bai Xiaochun fell back again and pulled out two spirit enhanced flying swords. After sending them shooting up, they were also sucked into the clouds, although the clouds weakened further in the process.Ghostfang\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cSpirit enhanced treasures\u2026?\u201dNext, before Ghostfang could even react, Bai Xiaochun suddenly produced eight more flying swords, all of which glittered with silver light as they shot up into the sky. Each and every one had a twofold spirit enhancement, and when they pierced into the cloud cover, it was weakened so much that rays of sunlight began to shine down, which caused the ten ghosts to shriek and dodge to the side.Ghostfang\u2019s eyes went wide, and despite his level of willpower, couldn\u2019t help but let out a cry of shock. \u201cS-so\u2026 so many!! Dammit, he can\u2019t have more than that, can he?!\u201dHe wasn\u2019t the only person to react in such a way. The Outer Sect disciples from both the south and north banks all looked on with disbelieving eyes, and began to shout aloud.\u201cHeavens! How many spirit enhanced items does Bai Xiaochun have?!\u201d\u201cMost disciples have trouble getting their hands on a single one. But he\u2026 has so many? Who enhanced them for him!?\u201dAs people shouted out in surprise, Big Fatty Zhang was there in the crowd. However, he was more toward the back, and although he had been cheering for Bai Xiaochun, nobody had really paid any attention to him.Now that he saw Bai Xiaochun using all of the flying swords, he lifted his chin loftily and said, \u201cAll of them were enhanced by me, Big Fatty Zhang!\u201dEven as Ghostfang tried to convince himself that Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t possibly have any more spirit enhanced items, Bai Xiaochun was delighted to discover that his swords were actually affecting the cloud cover. Immediately, he began to laugh out loud, and then produced two more flying swords. Silver light flashed as the spirit enhanced swords shot toward the clouds.\u201cImpossible!!\u201d Ghostfang shouted in shock.Rumbling sounds emanated from the clouds, which could not stand up to so many attacks by spirit enhanced swords. As sunlight spilled down, the ten ghosts screamed shrilly as they retreated back into the banner.As that happened, Bai Xiaochun laughed heartily and began to close in on Ghostfang, building up power to unleash the Throat Crushing Grasp again.An extremely unsightly expression appeared on Ghostfang\u2019s face. Just as he was about to fight back, blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he trembled. The side-effects of opening his second seal were now beginning to affect him. An unyielding expression on his face, he began to fall back as fast as possible.\u201cI concede!\u201d he said through gritted teeth. He knew that in his current state, he wasn\u2019t a match for Bai Xiaochun. Even still, he refused to acknowledge that he had truly been defeated. If Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t possessed so many spirit enhanced treasures, he would never have been able to defeat Ghosts Haunt the Night.Furthermore, if they had actually been fighting at night, he would have been defeated even more handily.In the moment that Ghostfang conceded, the shocked disciples of the south bank immediately broke out into excited cheering.\u201cWe won! The south bank won!!\u201d\u201cHahaha! We took first place! We got two people into the top three!!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten our revenge! Sect Uncle Bai is invincible!!\u201d The south bank disciples were cheering up a storm, while the north bank disciples looked on bitterly. They could all see that the problem wasn\u2019t Ghostfang being weak, it was Bai Xiaochun\u2026 having too many treasures.\u201cHow come you have so many spirit enhanced treasures, Bai Xiaochun!?\u201d Ghostfang asked, wanting to know why he had been defeated in such a way.\u201cMy Elder Brother Big Fatty Zhang is a spirit enhancement genius,\u201d Bai Xiaochun responded proudly. \u201cThe kind you only see once in a thousand\u2026 no, once in ten thousand years! All of those treasures I used were gifts from him. If you want to assign blame, blame the fact that my Elder Brother is a genius of spirit enhancement.\u201d The south bank disciples cried out in shock, with the commotion being especially loud among the Violet Cauldron Peak disciples.\u201cBig Fatty Zhang? Who is this god-like individual?\u201d\u201cBig Fatty Zhang. He\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s a Violet Cauldron Peak disciple!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the apprentice of the peak lord\u2026. Heavens, he usually keeps such a low profile. Who could ever have guessed that he was so incredible!?!?\u201dExcited, Big Fatty Zhang threw his head back and roared at the top of his lungs, \u201cI am Big Fatty Zhang!! All of the flying swords used by Bai Xiaochun were enhanced by me!!\u201dBig Fatty Zhang\u2019s excited words echoed out for everyone to hear. Even the sect leader and the others on the balcony turned to look at him curiously.As pandemonium continued to grip the crowd, Bai Xiaochun stood there blinking. Finally, he lifted his chin and waved his sleeve, looking like the ultimate hero. Turning slowly, he walked off of the arena floor.\u201cAi. Life is a lonely thing. With the snap of a finger, I reduced all the Chosen to ashes \u2026.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The other peak lords looked surprised, and their eyes began to shine.Xu Meixiang had taken Lu Tianlei away to begin treating his injuries, but if she were present, she would have been incredulous.Sounding very happy, the sect leader said, \u201cJunior Sister Meixiang rarely takes this chubby kid out in public. But now his future prospects are clear. His spirit enhancement has developed his will. With a strong will and a strong spirit, this kid is the kind that must be trained well!\u201dThe peak lord from Green Crest Peak smiled and said, \u201cNow that you mention it, his friend, that girl who also came from the Ovens, Qingrou, is actually quite impressive. She might not measure up to Tianyou, but she has her own special destiny. She seems connected to Green Crest Peak\u2019s mountain defense sword. She\u2019s currently seeking enlightenment in Green Crest Cave, and if things go well, Green Crest Peak will soon have another spirit sword guardian!\u201dAs the south bank audience went wild, the north bank disciples simply sat there silently while the sect leader formally announced the results.Bai Xiaochun had taken first place in the joint south and north bank Chosen battles! He would now join the Inner Sect!As a reward, he could visit Heavenhorn Pavilion on Mount Daoseed to select a precious treasure of the Qi Condensation level!Furthermore, he would be given the chance to enter the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s arcane pocket realm, where he could gain enlightenment of a divine ability! Of course, to take advantage of such an opportunity in the Qi Condensation stage would be a bit of a waste. Any disciple who took first place in the Chosen battles would almost certainly reach Foundation Establishment. That would be the time to use such a chance.The final reward was a prize of 10,000 spirit stones!Next, Zheng Yuandong formally bestowed the top ten disciples with the title of Chosen, and promoted them into the Inner Sect. Gradually, the crowds began to depart.The north bank disciples weren\u2019t very happy, but the south bank disciples were bursting with excitement. As for the Chosen, they had mixed expressions on their faces. Ghostfang watched Bai Xiaochun walk off, and sighed. Deep in his heart, he still didn\u2019t believe himself to have truly lost.As for the other north bank Chosen such as the Gongsun siblings and Xu Song, they left with clenched fists, all of them intent on returning to their respective mountain peaks and going into secluded meditation!Zhou Xinqi still had a hard time believing what she had seen, and looked a bit puzzled as she watched Bai Xiaochun leaving. Even more incredulous than her was Shangguan Tianyou.He stood there despondently, ignored by virtually everyone. His underhanded attack on Bai Xiaochun was something that would forever be etched into the hearts of the south bank disciples.Chuckling bitterly, he clenched his hands into fists.\u201cWe\u2019re only in Qi Condensation. Just wait until Foundation Establishment\u2026. I\u2019ll definitely be number one in that stage. I\u2019ll outdo Bai Xiaochun and Ghostfang both!\u201d Filled with determination, he held his head high with pride as he shot off in a beam of light.Gradually, everyone left the arena. The Chosen battles were over. However, the true fight between all the Chosen had only just begun.Everyone on both the south and north bank knew Bai Xiaochun\u2019s name, although on the north bank, it became a taboo word!He was the archenemy of the north bank, a shameless villain who had brought humiliation to all the disciples there!That was especially true of Beihan Lie. After being taken away by his master, he immediately went into secluded meditation, not daring to show his face in public. As for his huge dog, he released it somewhere on the north bank, relinquishing ownership of it for all time.Although the Nightstalker Beast was extraordinary, nobody could control it, and soon it became like a wild dog. Occasionally, people would catch glimpses of it roaming around near the four mountain peaks of the north bank\u2026.Countless north bank disciples went back and madly devoted themselves to cultivation. All of them swore oaths that one day, they would take the stain of humiliation inflicted by Bai Xiaochun and wash it clean with blood!The disciples even formed an organization called the Slay Xiaochun Society, which was devoted to eradicating Bai Xiaochun!Because of what had occurred in the Chosen battles, Big Fatty Zhang became incredibly famous. Everyone was completely shocked by the sheer number of spirit enhanced treasures of his that Bai Xiaochun had used in his final fight with Ghostfang.Big Fatty Zhang became a Chosen on Violet Cauldron Peak, and soon, countless disciples began to visit him, hoping to become friends and thus have access to spirit enhanced items.Big Fatty Zhang was very pleased by this, but didn\u2019t let it show. He wouldn\u2019t perform spirit enhancements for just anyone. Of course, the more he acted like that, the more people fawned over him. Eventually Xu Meixiang called him over to make a detailed inquiry. She almost couldn\u2019t believe what she heard, and was even more shocked to sense the power of will within him!In the end, she forbade him from performing spirit enhancements for anyone else, at least not until he could perform a fivefold spirit enhancement for Bai Xiaochun.Big Fatty Zhang found that a bit odd, but nodded in agreement nonetheless.\u201cSpirit enhancement is the most mysterious of arts,\u201d she thought. \u201cPerhaps Bai Xiaochun and Big Fatty Zhang have some special connection\u2026. If they help each other, the results could be shocking.\u201d Xu Meixiang watched thoughtfully as Big Fatty Zhang left. She didn\u2019t look into the matter any further. In the Spirit Stream Sect, everyone had their own destiny, and greedily attempting to take advantage of others could harm the foundation of the sect. Such actions were strictly forbidden. Besides, Bai Xiaochun had a unique status that made him especially difficult to deal with.The Spirit Stream Sect had remained strong for ten thousand years, and one of the reasons was that hard and fast rule.A few days later, Bai Xiaochun got his Inner Sect uniform and command medallion. Furthermore, he received orders from Elder Xu, who led the Inner Sect on Fragrant Cloud Peak, to pack his bags and leave the courtyard residence that had been his home for the past few years.Inner Sect disciples all received immortal\u2019s caves filled with strong spiritual energy!The so-called immortal\u2019s caves were like heavenly abodes that were worlds unto their own. Having taken first place in the Chosen battles, Bai Xiaochun had his pick of the available immortal\u2019s caves, and naturally, he picked the best one. It was on the rear side of Fragrant Cloud Peak, at the end of a narrow little path, a quiet place filled with strong spiritual energy.The cave itself had five rooms, with nightpearls inlaid in the ceilings that filled the place with soft light. There was a large main hall with a little hot spring in the middle. Warm water bubbled up, forming a small pond, within which a few hot spring fish swam lazily about.The immortal\u2019s cave was simple but impressive. It had a medicine concocting workshop, secluded meditation facilities, a spirit plant nursery, and a place set aside for practicing magics.Also included were two puppets with cultivation bases equivalent to the fifth level of Qi Condensation, who cared for day-to-day affairs for Bai Xiaochun. Every room in the immortal\u2019s cave had a spell formation, as did the main hall. Once activated, the stone walls and ceilings would vanish to reveal an image of the sky above. At night, it was even possible to see the moon and the stars. There was a larger spell formation that covered the entire immortal\u2019s cave, and once activated, not even an early Foundation Establishment cultivator would be able to break in.This immortal\u2019s cave would even be suitable for a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and in fact, it was one of the nicest in all of Fragrant Cloud Peak.Bai Xiaochun looked very pleased, and his heart nearly burst with joy. Now that he thought about it, his previous courtyard residence had been far too simple and crude. As he saw Elder Xu off, Elder Xu repeatedly reminded him to go to the Inner Sect Spirit Pavilion to find the technique Li Qinghou had suggested for him. Finally, Elder Xu left.After he was sure Elder Xu was gone, Bai Xiaochun stripped naked and jumped into the pond, where he floated there, sighing contentedly. Occasionally a fish would float by and nibble a bit on his skin. It was a feeling the likes of which he had never experienced before in his life.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad Du Lingfei isn\u2019t here in the sect. Having her here to bathe with would be great.\u201d Sighing, he thought of Hou Xiaomei, and then smiled radiantly. As of that moment, he vowed to find an opportunity to get her to come over and join him in the hot spring to look at the stars.After some deep thought, he came to the conclusion that his previous way of thinking had been far too limited. \u201cAs a man of ambition, I should get Hou Xiaomei and Du Lingfei to come join me in the hot spring at the same time.\u201dThe next morning, Bai Xiaochun woke early and left his immortal\u2019s cave. Strolling along the little mountain path, he noticed another immortal\u2019s cave not too far off.It was only a few meters away, located almost directly across from his own. It had its spell formation activated, and appeared to be occupied. Bai Xiaochun studied it curiously for a few minutes before looking away.As he strolled along, he realized that there weren\u2019t any Outer Sect disciples to be seen, only a few Inner Sect disciples.Most people weren\u2019t out and about, but rather, secluded in meditation. The only time they would come out would be to go on sect missions. Of course, whenever Bai Xiaochun did see someone, he would clear his throat and strike a pose. After looking shocked for a moment, the Inner Sect disciple would inevitably greet him as Sect Uncle Bai.Being addressed in such a manner as he went along lifted his spirits. He swaggered along through Fragrant Cloud Peak until he reached the Inner Sect\u2019s Spirit Pavilion. That was a location where the Inner Sect disciples practiced their various techniques and abilities.Whenever a disciple was promoted to the Inner Sect, they would be able to acquire one of the sect\u2019s techniques at no cost. As soon as Bai Xiaochun arrived, the disciple in charge clasped hands in greeting. Feeling more pleased than ever, Bai Xiaochun clapped his shoulder and then went to look at the options he had in terms of techniques.\u201cSever Heaven and Earth?\u201cWaterflame Theorem!\u201cNine Heavens Earth Destruction Incantation?\u201dAfter examining the options available, the techniques started to blur together, and he had no idea which one he should pick. They all seemed incredible. Eventually, he found the technique Li Qinghou had suggested that he cultivate.\u201cDragon Mammoth Sea-Forming Scripture?\u201d He picked up the jade slip and sent some spiritual power into it. After examining the introduction, his eyes went wide, and his scalp began to tingle.\u201cEveryone is bound by shackles. Whether in terms of cultivation base or the fleshly body, there are life essence shackles which cannot be broken\u2026. I have created this technique, suitable for cultivation in the Qi Condensation stage, not to break through the shackles, but to gain enlightenment of them!\u201dBai Xiaochun took a deep breath and thought back to the black-robed man who had saved his life, the one who called himself the gravekeeper. The words in the introduction of this scripture reminded him of the words that man had spoken.\u201cThe five volumes of the Undying Codex. Break through the five shackles of mortality. The five volumes of the Live Forever Codex. Break through the five seals of eternity!\u201dHe suddenly had the feeling that this Dragon Mammoth Sea-Forming Scripture was anything but ordinary. However, after further examination, he frowned. Based on the description, there didn\u2019t seem to be anything particularly astonishing about it. In fact, it didn\u2019t even seem to measure up to some of the other powerful magical techniques he\u2019d just looked at. After a moment though, his expression brightened as he realized that it dovetailed perfectly with the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art, and also increased the chances of reaching Foundation Establishment!Bai Xiaochun had been dreaming of reaching Foundation Establishment for years now, and merely thinking about it would leave his heart pounding.The Dragon Mammoth Sea-Forming Scripture only had three levels. The first led to the ninth level of Qi Condensation, the second led to the great circle of the tenth level of Qi Condensation. The final level led to\u2026 Foundation Establishment!At the pinnacle, the fleshly body would have the strength of dragons and mammoths, and one\u2019s spiritual power would form a huge sea. Best of all was that after creating such a matchless foundation, once one reached Foundation Establishment, it would be much easier to learn just about any divine ability, without worrying about an incompatibility problem.It was something extraordinary within the ordinary!\u201cThis is the one for me!\u201d Whether because of the fact that the introduction mentioned shackles, or that the scripture could help him reach Foundation Establishment, it left Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart pounding. Dragon Mammoth Sea-Forming Scripture in hand, he left the Inner Sect Spirit Pavilion and headed back toward his immortal\u2019s cave.Just when he was almost there, the gate of the immortal\u2019s cave across from him opened, and a young woman walked out. As soon as she saw him, her jaw dropped, and she tried to duck back inside, but wasn\u2019t fast enough.\u201cEee? Sect Niece Xinqi!\u201d He was immediately elated. Ever since the Chosen battles, Zhou Xinqi had kept her distance from him. He\u2019d wanted to get her to address him as Sect Uncle, but had never found the chance. Who would have thought that he was now living right across from her!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
